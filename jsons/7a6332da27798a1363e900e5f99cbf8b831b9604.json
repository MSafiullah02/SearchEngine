The main climatic predictor of species number was humidity. SPR and SMR revealed three main groups of ferns with different ecological trends. NMS and PAD analyses separated the four areas of highest diversity in Africa, three of which are inhabited by ferns with distinct ecological requirements. The fourth area was Madagascar, which shows an accumulation of endemic and relict diversity that is not easy to explain.",

These probably allowed many species to recolonize the neighbouring areas after the extinctions of the Pleistocene. Three major components were detected in the African flora: Guinea-Congolian thermophilous, cold-tolerant Afro-montane, and Southern drought-tolerant elements. These are related to the three main refuge areas, i.e. the Gulf of Guinea area, the eastern tropical region, and the Cape region. Endemicity in ferns was found to be lower than that of seed plants due to the higher dispersability of fern spores. The distance between OGUs seems to be the main predictor of the number of endemic fern species these areas contain.",

However, in Africa, ferns are highly diversified in the eastern mountain arc, and somewhat less so in the western mountains (Schelpe, 1983) . Three main latitude groupings -tropical, Mediterranean and Cape -are usually used to describe the continental pteridophyte flora of Africa (Korna\u015b, 1993) . Island floras include the Macaronesian flora, the flora of the Atlantic islands, and the flora of the Malgache region. The Macaronesian flora is mainly related to Mediterranean or Palaeomediterranean floras. Madagascar has an extraordinarily rich tropical flora with a very high number of endemic species, probably influenced by a very conservative climate. The flora of the South Atlantic islands is most closely related to that of South America, the sub-Antarctic islands, and to a lesser degree to the Cape flora. A feature of this flora is their adaptation for long-distance dispersal (Smith, 1972) .",

Diversity and local endemism should therefore increase towards refuges because of their isolation and the maintenance of favourable climatic conditions. The existence of refuges has been questioned by several authors. The main arguments against them are Neotropical (Colinvaux et al., 2000) , while those in favour are based on evidence from Africa (Linder, 2001) . Based on the distribution of several groups of plants (Linder, 2001) and animals (Mayr & O'Hara, 1986; Harcourt, 2000) , Africa is thought to harbour several of these refuges. There is remarkable congruence between centres of endemism and refuges, suggesting that the latter are not artefacts and that the pattern of African flora is well defined (Linder, 2001) .",

Seven complementary analyses were undertaken that together provide the most complete picture yet of the biogeography of African fern flora: 1. The number of taxa in 29 operational geographical units (OGUs) was determined in order to evaluate c-diversity, and the ratios between species and genera richness (and other taxa) compared to determine whether any OGUs do not follow the general pattern. 2. The correlation between species number and latitude or longitude was analysed to study diversity gradients. Standard pairwise and stepwise multiple regression analyses (SPR and SMR) were used to determine the explanatory power of climatic and physical variables. 3. Independent SMR analyses were performed for large genera to show their climatic preferences, and in order to explain their distribution patterns. These analyses were performed using the relative contributions of species to each OGU and environmental variables. 4. The influence of dispersal and reproduction methods on the colonization of isolated marine or 'habitat' islands and on the evolution of endemism was assessed, relating the proportion of species with trilete spores and gemmiferous reproduction, etc., to environmental factors. 5. The floristic affinities among OGUs were analysed using non-metric multi-dimensional scaling (NMS) and compared with b-turnover and inter-OGU distances. 6. Patterns of endemicity were documented by performing several tests: (i) the determination of correlations between the number of endemic species and latitude to look for gradients in endemicity; (ii) the determination of correlations between the number of endemic species and the distances between OGUs, in order to study their isolation; and (iii) SMR analyses of the relative contribution of endemic species and climatic and physical variables, in order to determine these variables' explanatory power. 7. The consistency of floral affinities deduced from NMS analyses was tested. To phenetically classify biotas and to search for possible historical patterns, parsimonic analysis of dispersion (PAD) was performed.",

The inter-OGU distances were calculated using their geographical centres.",

To avoid redundancy, those variables that showed a tolerance of less than 0.3 were excluded from taxa and predictor SMR analyses. The number of hours of sunshine per year, mean annual rainfall, driest month rainfall and cloudiness were deleted from these analyses. The final results were compared using forward and backward stepwise regression procedures. As all the results were similar, multicollinearity was not a serious problem.",

            "text": "For PAD, cladistic analyses were performed using the PAUP software package (Swofford, 1993) . Sites were used as characters and the presence or absence of species as states of these characters. Endemic species were deleted. All characters were unweighted and unordered. Fitch parsimony was used for all the assays. Data were analysed using the exhaustive option. Polarization of characters into plesiomorphic and apomorphic states was assessed using the standard comparison procedure with an outgroup composed entirely of zeros (Lundgberg rooting; Rosen, 1988) . MacClade version 3.04 software was used to edit the data set analysed with PAUP (Maddison & Maddison, 1992) , and also to map the distribution of particular character-state changes. A recommended prerequisite for PAD analyses is to select areas with a comparable number of taxa (Rosen, 1988; Crisci et al., 2000) . If areas with a very dissimilar number of species are studied, the sites with a lower number usually end up at the base of the respective clade. This apparent artefact is one of the main problems of PAD or parsimonic analyses of endemicity (PAE). Thus, sites with a low number of taxa should be excluded. In this analysis, OGUs with less than 45 species were excluded. Even if PAD analyses unveil hierarchical patterns among OGUs, they should not be used to search for historical patterns between areas, but only to phonetically classify biotas (Rosen, 1988; Crisci et al., 2000) . Table 1 shows the number of fern species, genera, families, species/genus, genus/family and species/family of the different OGUs. The absolute number of species, genera and families in continental Africa (with its greatly superior area), Madagascar (Table 1, Fig. 2a) , and two small mountain refuges in South America (Parque Carrasco) and Asia (Mt Kinabalu) (Kessler et al., 2001; Kessler, 2002) are comparable in magnitude. Thus, the African fern flora appears to be quite impoverished (Tryon, 1986; Korna\u015b, 1993) . The sites of the East African mountain arc showed the highest number of species of continental Africa, with the Kipengere, Aberdare and Rukiya Ranges, and Table 1 Areas, number of taxa, taxa ratios, residuals of species-area regression and number of endemics in Africa, Madagascar, different sites of Africa and two flora refuges, one of Asia and the other of South America. Data of Africa are from this study, while data of P. Carrasco and Mt Kinabalu are from Kessler et al. (2001) Drakensberg in first position, and Bioko in fifth place. The large areas covered by these sites, as well as their elevation, allow a large variety of habitats to exist. These factors, plus the stability of the Agulhas current, increase the possibilities of a species surviving there during times of drought. A general relationship is found between species richness and higher taxon richness (Gaston & Blackburn, 1995; Williams et al., 1997) , and this includes ferns (Williams & Gaston, 1994) (Fig. 3) . The species/genus, genera/family and species/family ratios showed quite comparable patterns and were related to species richness.",

The correlation between the logarithm of the species number and latitude was low (R \u00bc )0.41, P \u00bc 0.035) due to climatic heterogeneity and differences in area and elevation. The main climatic variable that changes with latitude is usually temperature, with lower latitudes showing high overall temperatures and weaker seasonal variations (see Appendix S2). But other climatic variables also depend on latitude, e.g. rainfall, moisture, the number of hours of sunshine per year and cloud cover. However, temperature can be also influenced by other factors. Moisture varies with longitude due to the effects of sea currents, but inversely on either side of Africa (Iriondo, 1999; Gasse, 2000) .

St Helena and Tristan da Cunha showed distinctive patterns: there are fewer endemic ferns than endemic flowering plants, while the residual of the species number was positive for ferns and negative for flowering plants (Hobohm, 2000) . These data indicate that these islands maintained a comparatively richer flora of ferns than other islands of similar area. Thus, both islands may have suffered intense extinctions of flowering plants or lower colonization. Conversely, in Cape Verde, both ferns and flowering plants show negative residuals, probably because of droughts causing a general impoverishment of the flora.",

SMR analyses conducted with the relative contributions of species to each OGU were tested for significance (Table 6 ).

            "text": "Two of the most studied drought-tolerant genera are Cheilanthes Sw. and Pellaea Link (Pteridaceae). These are represented by a comparatively high number of species in Namibia, on Jebel Marra and on Table Mountain . They also grow in the tropical zone -at least the species adapted to inselbergs -on dry slopes and in other arid habitats (Reitsma et al., 1992) . Some genera of this group grow in mountainous areas, where they reach high elevations. They are sometimes found in forests but never live as epiphytes (Table 9 ). Species such as Adiantum thalictroides Willd. ex Schltdl., Cheilanthes hyaloglandulosa W. Jacobsen & N. Jacobsen, C. eckloniana (Kunze) Mett., C. hirta Sw., C. multifida (Sw.) Sw., Pellaea calomelanos (Sw.) Link, P. boivinii Hook., P. quadripinnata (Forssk.) Prantl, Pityrogramma aurantiaca (Hieron.) C. Chr., P. elongata (C. Chr.) Pichi-Serm., P. rupicola Pichi-Serm., grow above 2000 m (Jacobsen & Jacobsen, 1989) . Thus, in some cases, these Cheilanthoid ferns grow at high elevations in the microthermal region (Jacobsen & Jacobsen, 1989) . They can be found in cloud forests, which rarely suffer water shortages (Bruijnzeel & Veneklaas, 1998; Foster, 2001) , and in ericaceous brush. The abundance of ferns with xerophytic morphology in cloud forests is comparable with that of other plants (Flenley, 1992a (Flenley, , 1995 . Bruijnzeel & Proctor (1995) and Flenley (1992b) suggest this morphology can be explained by exposure to harmful UV-B radiation at these elevation. Reduced leaf transpiration, root respiration and nutrient uptake in these poor soils have also been proposed as compatible with the development of xeromorphic features (Hafkenscheid, 2000; Foster, 2001) . The drought-tolerant taxa are characterized by particular adaptations such as curling, and by being poikilohydrous or winter-or summer-dormant. A revision of these life styles was published by Korna\u015b (1977) . Some peculiar features include long dormancy with shedding of fronds, the protection of buds with scales and the bases of the stipes, Table 8 Negative correlation of relative contribution of ferns of group 3 (drought-tolerant ferns) in stepwise multiple regression analysis. The variables which were not significantly correlated or out of the model were Kira warmth index, difference between max. and min. monthly mean temperatures, elevation (in m), and distance to closest site (in km)",

This can be explained in that the Namib and Kalahari deserts are older than the Sahara or other African deserts. The Benguela current originated some time after the upper Eocene (Maley, 1996) , causing the drying of the south-western coast of Africa (forming the Namib and Kalahari Deserts), while the Sahara appeared as late as the lower Pliocene (Maley, 1980) . The pronounced glacial Antarctic cooling that occurred during the late Quaternary was accompanied by intensification of the south-east trade winds which caused stronger aridification along the east African coast (Shi et al., 2001) . There are several other cases of arid-adapted genera with their centre of distribution in Namibia which reach the Saharo-Sindian deserts or the dry habitats of the Mediterranean (De Winter, 1971 ). These distributions are most easily explained if these taxa were dispersed from south-eastern Africa to the North via an arid tract of territory (Van Zinderen Bakker, 1975; Coetzee, 1983) . Until the late Miocene, the woodland savanna of the Sahara would have prevented the spread of many of these genera (Axelrod & Raven, 1978; Maley, 1996) .",

The tree ferns are present in most tropical mountain zones of the world, where they show considerable diversity and endemism. In New Guinea and in the Andes, the optimum elevation is between 1000 and 2500 m; only a few species reach 3000-5000 m (Tryon & Gastony, 1975) ; (2) Lindsaea Dryand. ex Sm.

However, the evidence indicates that this potential constraint is ineffective (Tryon, 1986) . Dassler & Farrar (2001) supported this opinion because they found a higher ratio of chlorophyllous ferns on islands. There is a strong coincidence between fern species with gemmiferous gametophytes and chlorophyllous spores (Table 9 ). Species with the latter characteristics were somewhat related to high humidity. The arc-sines of the relative proportions of ferns with chlorophyllous spores, and those of gemmiferous gametophytes, correlated with the arcsines of humidity (R \u00bc 0.721, P < 0.0001, and R \u00bc 0.781, P < 0.0001, respectively).",

One arm goes from Rukiya to the Gulf of Guinea and the West African OGUs. The second reaches Ethiopia, Jebel Marra and Cape Verde. The third reaches Angola and the fourth goes out to the Kipengere Range, Madagascar, Inyanga and the southern African OGUs. Two branches extend from Table Mountain: one to St Helena and Ascension, the other to Tristan da Cunha and Gough and Marion Islands. The similarity of the central and southern Atlantic island flora with that of Africa is scant, and only a few species are shared with the Cape area (mainly Table Mountain ) (Jaccard indices, I J \u00bc 0.101 with Tristan da Cunha, and I J \u00bc 0.123 with St Helena). As previously commented, Tristan da Cunha, Gough Island and Marion Island have more species in common with South America and other sub-Antarctic islands than with South Africa (Tables 11 & 12 ; Schelpe, 1983) . The centre of this network is shown in the inset of Fig. 6 . The sites of Upper and Lower Guinea form a homogeneous group related to the East African mountain arc, possibly as a consequence of migrations between eastern and western refuges during cold periods (Maley, 1990 (Maley, , 1991 . The b-turnover between these OGUs is relatively low. In addition, a line links the East African mountain arc sites to Angola, Madagascar, Namibia, and the rest of southern Africa. The flora of Bioko, Mt Cameroon and S. Tom\u00e9 are therefore similar. The Jaccard indexes are I J \u00bc 0.678 between Bioko and Mt Cameroon, and I J \u00bc 0.513 between Bioko and S. Tom\u00e9. Mt Oku and Mt Cameroon, however, are less similar (I J \u00bc 0.22), as is Annob\u00f3 n to R\u00edo Muni (I J \u00bc 0.27). The distribution of animal groups in these areas show comparable patterns, e.g. the fauna of Mt Cameroon and Bioko are quite similar while that of Mt Oku is somewhat different (Smith et al., 2000) . These differences might be caused by the climatic characteristics of Mt Oku and Annob\u00f3 n, which receive considerably less rain (3000 mm year )1 on Mt Oku and 1000 mm year )1 on Annob\u00f3 n, compared with 10,000 mm year )1 on Mt Cameroon and 5000 mm year )1 on S.

Inter-OGU distance significantly hinders dispersion from centres of diversity, reducing the number of species shared with potentially associated sites (Table 13) . These data underscore another point discussed later: the relationship between the relative number of endemic species in a site and its distance to other centres of endemism. The b-turnovers between OGUs were also calculated to evaluate the d-diversity (Shmida & Wilson, 1985 , Table 13 ; Fig. 7a ). If the most similar pairs of sites are compared, b-turnover is significantly correlated with the logarithm of the distance between them (R \u00bc 0.537, P \u00bc 0.003). If all sites are compared using a Mantel test, the correlation between both variables is also significant (R \u00bc 0.636, t \u00bc 7.47 and P \u00bc 1). b-turnover is more useful for comparing sites with a similar degree of diversity as it is sensitive to differences in the total number of species. With respect to the b-turnovers of the sites of Upper and Lower Guinea, the largest differences in fern flora were seen between Mt Oku, Annob\u00f3 n, and Mt Togo; all other sites showed quite similar values. These three sites have a considerably impoverished flora with only 51, 42 and 39 species, respectively. This might be due to the lower elevation of their mountains (which also occupy a reduced area) and the drier climate (they lie beyond the equatorial forest zone). The largest differences between central and south-eastern Africa were those of Drakensberg and Madagascar respect to the Kipengere Range (b-turnover Drakensberg-Kipengere \u00bc 0.656 and Madagascar-Kipengere \u00bc 0.580; the number of species is 207 in Drakensberg, 336 in Kipengere and 542 in Madagascar). These differences are possibly related to the c-diversity and endemism rates, which are extraordinarily high in Madagascar and Drakensberg.",

            "text": "The number of endemic species is irregular along the latitude gradient, with large differences between OGUs (Fig. 2b) . SMR analyses were performed with the same variables and transformations as before (see SMR of species number). The arcsines of the relative contributions of endemics were used as the dependent variable. The variables showing the greatest beta and partial correlations were inter-OGU distance (B \u00bc 0.45, pc \u00bc 0.46, P \u00bc 0.020) and humidity (B \u00bc 0.54, pc \u00bc 0.45, P \u00bc 0.021) (R 2 \u00bc 0.25, F \u00bc 3.89 and SE \u00bc 0.1). These data indicate a weak correlation. However, several endemic species were shared by the closest sites (i.e. the Aberdare, Kipengere Ranges, and Rukiya Ranges, or Mt Cameroon and Bioko). The number of endemic species by ensemble of sites was, therefore, also plotted. These ensembles were Ethiopia and Jebel Marra, Table 13 Comparison of distances, floral similitude using Jaccard indices and b-turnover between operational geographical units (OGUs). The pairs of OGUs compared were not the nearest but those in which the minimal floral differences occur (calculated by Jaccard index) Pairs (Hobohm, 2000; Myers et al., 2000) , a considerably higher number of the latter is seen (Table 4 ). This suggests the island was a refuge for both groups, but that the flowering plants suffered greater isolation leading to higher endemicity (41.7% of ferns and 80.6% of plants are endemic, Myers et al., 2000) . These results are not surprising as endemicity in ferns is usually less than that observed in flowering plants. Myers et al. (2000) reported a higher ratio of plant endemicity than Hobohm (2000) . They also recorded data for birds, mammals, reptiles and amphibians, most of which showed degrees of endemicity of around 80-90%. The exception was birds (55.4%) which is similar to the figure for ferns. These results might be explained by the superior dispersal capabilities of ferns and birds. They also confirm the important role of Madagascar as a refuge for most taxonomic groups. The extraordinary number of endemic species in Madagascar is not explainable by isolation, climatic stability or low competition alone; only a combination of these can explain the problem satisfactorily. This island seems to be a 'museum of endemic diversity' for many taxonomic groups including primates (Harcourt, 2000) , amphibians (Bossuyt & Milinkovitch, 2000) , butterflies (Torres et al., 2001) , and plants such as Winteraceae, Canellaceae, Monimiaceae, Diegodendraceae, Sphaerosepalaceae, Sarcolenaceae, Asteropeiaceae and Medusagynaceae. (Leroy, 1978) . Comparable patterns of high endemicity on islands close to a relatively depauperate continent have been reported for flowering plants, e.g. on the Canary Islands, Ceylon, New Guinea, New Caledonia, New Zealand, the Greater Antilles, or even the Californian coastal islands (Cronk, 1992; Medail & Qu\u00e9zel, 1997; Mueller-Dombois & Fosberg, 1998; Baldwin, pers. comm.) . In some cases, species currently extinct on the continent are preserved, have related taxa, or have even undergone adaptive radiation on these islands. Cronk (1987 Cronk ( , 1990 suggested that Madagascar is a centre of 'reliction', meaning that groups of plants now extinct in all the remaining areas of their initial distribution continue to survive here. Such 'reliction' has also been reported on St Helena (Cronk, 1987 (Cronk, , 1990 .",

If the ratio between the number of endemic species and the total number of species is plotted against the logarithm of the inter-OGU distances, the correlation is weak but significant ( Fig. 7b ; R \u00bc 0.404, P \u00bc 0.029). The sites were ordered according to the MST obtained from the Jaccard indices matrix used for multidimensional scaling (see previous section). If the observed values are plotted against those predicted, four sites are recorded outside the 95% confidence limits (CI): Madagascar, St Helena, Ascension Island and Tristan da Cunha. Below the 95% CI are Jebel Marra, Namibia, Angola and Mt Loma (Fig. 7b) . The latter OGUs now have either a dry climate or a small habitable area. The isolation of the central Atlantic and sub-Antarctic Islands is sufficient to explain their impoverished flora and high endemic ratios. But this cannot be the case of Madagascar, which is too close to the continent to seriously impair the windblown arrival of spores; even large vertebrates have made the crossing (Mc Call, 1997) . There are also large differences in endemicity in continental Africa, e.g. between the Eastern African mountain arc and Upper and Lower Guinea. These differences are at their greatest, however, between Drakensberg (4.5% endemicity) and Bioko (1.5% endemicity) (Table 1) . Myers et al. (2000) indicated the eastern mountains and coastal forests of Tanzania and Kenya to have the highest endemism ratios in the world for flowering plants.

Tom\u00e9, Mt Moukand\u00e9, R\u00edo Muni) and Angola; (2) those of the Eastern African mountain arc (the Rukiya, Aberdare and Kipengere Ranges, Inyanga and Drakensberg) and Madagascar; and (3) those of the Cape area (Mt Knysna, Table Mountain and Namibia). Ethiopia and Mt Oku fell at the base of the two first clades. However, these sites have a rather impoverished flora, making it difficult to interpret their holding this position (Fig. 8) . Three major components were also detected in numerical analyses of Zambian ferns by Dzwonko & Korna\u015b (1978) -the Guineo-Congolian, Afro-montane and Southern xerophilic elements -which essentially correspond to groups 1, 2 and 3, respectively. These three large biogeographical areas seem to show good floral and climatic coherence. A consistent clade is that of tropical eastern Africa: Inyanga plus Drakensberg appears as a small clade sister of the main clade containing the Aberdare, Kipengere and Rukiya Ranges. The crown of the tree has Madagascar as its sister. The close relationships between Madagascar and Kipengere were also shown by NMS, as were those between Drakensberg, Inyanga and the Great Lakes sites. In the tropical western Africa clade, Angola appears as the sister of Upper and Lower Guinea. Mt Cameroon is closely related to the islands of the African aseismic dorsal (Bioko and S. Tom\u00e9) while the two continental areas of R\u00edo Muni and Mt Moukand\u00e9 (Gabon) are beside one another. These area relationships are also quite similar to those revealed by NMS analysis.",

The large subclades of the Guinea and Angola areas (histogram A) share a large number of group 1 species (thermophilous ferns) in the basal nodes. The subclade of the Eastern African mountain arc and Madagascar (histogram B) have similar proportions of species of thermophilous ferns, cold-tolerant ferns and drought-tolerant ferns. Finally the southern African clade (histogram C) has many species of drought-tolerant ferns. The basal clades of the entire tree are characterized by having many species of thermophilous ferns (histograms D and E). These data suggest a possible historical pattern for African mountain refuges: an older flora mainly formed by thermophilous ferns (group 1) could have given rise to several other floras diverse in their ecological preferences, some richer in cold-tolerant ferns or in drought-tolerant ferns. This hypothesis seems to agree with data concerning the recent evolution of the African climate (Maley, 1990 (Maley, , 1991 .",
