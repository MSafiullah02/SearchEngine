            "text": "Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) is a doublestranded DNA virus with 152-kb genome that infects the majority of the human population. It can express two distinct transcriptional patterns: lytic (productive) infection and latency infection. During lytic infection, approximately 74 genes encoded within the viral genome are classified as immediate-early (IE or a), early (b) and late (g) genes by RNA polymerase II. 1, 2 The immediate-early gene infected-cell polypeptide 4 (ICP4) is a major regulatory gene required for efficient transcription of early and late viral genes that make it essential for lytic infection. 1 ICP4 protein, which is synthesized immediately after the infection, binds DNA in a sequence-specific manner as a homodimer. 3, 4 Su et al. reported that ICP4 protein plays an important role in mediating the circularization of the viral genome as ICP4 deletion mutant d120 failed to assume an endless or circular conformation following infection. 5 In addition, ICP4 has been previously associated with the formation of viral replication compartments and increased formation of transcription preinitiation complexes in a TATA box-dependent manner. [6] [7] [8] Studies have suggested that ICP4 intervenes at a very early step in the formation of the transcription initiation complex and that its mechanism of recruitment is fundamentally different from that of other activators, such as VP16. 6 The VP16 gene is a late gene whose expression is dependent on IE, early-protein functions and viral DNA replication. 9, 10 The activation domain of VP16 has been suggested to recruit general transcription factors and co-activators to IE promoters via proteinprotein interaction and to reduce the association of histones with those promoters; thus, VP16 activates transcription of the IE genes and results in a cascade of gene transcription considered to be essential for HSV-1 replication. 9, 11 Both VP16, which activates transcription of the five IE genes, and ICP4, which activates the remainder of the HSV genome, function at the level of transcription initiation, contributing to the lytic cascade of viral gene expression.",

HSV-1 is the second most common cause of ARN, 16 and the leading cause in ARN patients older than 25 years. 18 ARN may result from the direct invasion of HSV-1 or a recurrence of a previous episode of retinitis, keratitis and/or encephalitis caused by the virus. 19, 20 Furthermore, latent HSV-1 infections, which occur in more than 90% of adults, may be triggered by such events as trauma, UV irradiation, neurosurgery or high-dose corticosteroids. 21 Therefore, suppressing productive infection of the virus is vital in clinical practice to control HSV-1-associated diseases.",

We showed that siRNA significantly decreased the expression of ICP4 and inhibited viral replication in RPEs. In addition, we found that ICP4-targeting siRNA (ICP4-siRNA) can still inhibit viral replication post-infection by HSV-1, which mimics the clinical treatment after the HSV-1 lytic infection. Moreover, ICP4-siRNA also downregulated ICP4 protein expression in human corneal epithelial cells (HCEs), human trabecular meshwork cells (HTMs) and Vero cells, which further supported that ICP4-siRNA inhibited HSV-1 replication in vitro.",

As ICP4 is an early key transcription activator in HSV-1 replication and target of HSV-1 miR-H6, we began this study with the goal of inhibiting HSV-1 replication by siRNA targeting to viral ICP4. We showed that ICP4-targeting siRNA significantly suppressed the expression of ICP4 and decreased the viral levels in cultured RPEs. Less CPE and lower viral titre were seen in HSV-1-infected RPEs that were transfected with ICP4-siRNA compared with cells treated with mock siRNA or siRNAuntreated control cells. The tegument protein VP16 gene, a component of the virion that facilitates the immediate-early gene expression in a cascade of gene transcription, 11 was decreased in RPEs treated with ICP4-targeting siRNA, which mainly because of siRNA decreased HSV-1 replication. Furthermore, ICP4-siRNA downregulating the ICP4 expression was demonstrated in HCE, HTM and Vero cells (Fig. 6) . These results suggested that using siRNA against ICP4 potently inhibited HSV-1 replication and may have the potential for clinical application.",

It is the major transcriptional activator required for the activated expression of other HSV-1 genes. 2, 10 Its functions of mediating the circularization of the HSV-1 genome, constitution of viral replication compartments, and formation of ICP8 microfoci in production infection have been demonstrated in the literature. 5, 7 ICP4 also involves the delocalization of nucleolin, an abundant host nucleoli protein, from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, where it forms aggresomes for degradation. 35 In addition, ICP4 expression is regulated by the repressor element silencing transcription factor/neuronal restrictive silencer factor (REST/NRSF), which may play an important role in the establishment and/or maintenance of HSV-1 gene silencing during HSV-1 latent infection. 36 RNAi technology has been used to silence gene expression by directly targeting a specific sequence of mRNA and has been reported to be an ideal tool for treatment of viral infectious diseases by silencing viral genes. 37, 38 Many publications have described the inhibition of viruses, including human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), hepers simplex virus (HSV), hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV), by targeting and silencing diverse viral genes as well as cell genes that are essential for virus replication. 27, [39] [40] [41] Studies have applied RNAi to interfere with HSV-1 infection. Zhe et al., for example, reported that synthetic siRNA silenced specifically the HSV-1 UL39 gene that codes ICP6 and inhibited HSV-1 replication in Vero cells. 25 There is also evidence that siRNA specific for glycoprotein E can suppress HSV-1 glycoprotein E expression and reproduce a gE-deletion mutant virus in keratinocytes. 27 In addition, using RNAi against cellular DNA ligases I, III and IV, Muylaert and colleague found that DNA ligase IV and its cofactor XRCC4 reduced HSV-1 production in human fibroblasts. On the other hand, RNAi-mediated depletion of neither DNA ligase I nor DNA ligase III appears to affect virus replication. 42 As RPEs are the target cells of HSV-1 in retina, we used RNAi to inhibit HSV-1 lytic infection in cultured RPEs. Our results show that using ICP4-siRNA can dramatically reduce HSV-1 replication in RPEs infected with viruses either before or after the transfection of siRNA.",

We have reported that HSV-1 genes can be found in HSV-1-infected RPEs at 2 h p.i. 14 In the current study, we showed that the transfection of chemically synthesized ICP4-targeting siRNA could inhibit ICP4 protein expression in both pre-and post-HSV-1-infected RPEs (Fig. 1 ). In addition, inhibitory effects were related to the concentration of siRNA, such that 100 nM siRNA was somewhat more effective than 50 nM (Fig. 4) . The inhibitory effects of siRNA concentration dependence have been reported in other virus infections, such as SARS coronavirus, 44 HCV, 41 and HIV. 39 In our study, however, neither 100 nM siRNA nor 50 nM siRNA could block all viral production, suggesting that the siRNA-delivery approach needs to be improved in the culture situation in vitro. Perhaps prolonging the periods of siRNA delivery or increasing the amount of valid siRNA in cells will suppress virus production more effectively.",

Several studies have shown that clearance of the virus from a cell culture occurs only when the virus sequence is 100% identical to the siRNA, 38, 41 and that multiple siRNAs that target one or more specific regions of the RNA sequences may limit the emergence of escape mutants and increase the virusinhibition capacity. 41, 45 Therefore, using multiple siRNAs to target ICP4 or other HSV-1 genes may inhibit virus production effectively. In addition, Liu et al. reported in Chinese that lentiviral plasmid pLKO-puro(r)-hU6-siRNA targeting ICP4 attenuates replication of HSV-1 in Vero cells, 46 which, in consist with our results, suggests that suppression of ICP4 can effectively inhibit production of HSV-1. However, considering the application RNAi in vivo, chemically synthesized siRNA can be more efficiently delivered into cells with less side effects, 47, 48 and using direct introduction of synthetic siRNAs is most of the impending therapeutic applications based on RNAi propose. 47 Recently, delivering genes or siRNAs by intravitreal or subretinal injection has been reported in treatment of retinal diseases. For example, siRNA anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has been used in patients with neovascularization resulting from age-related macular degeneration, and stabilization or improvement in visual acuity has been observed. 49 Furthermore, studies reported that the subretinal injection of adeno-associated viral vectors encoding RPE65 was safe and, in some cases, effective in patients with Leber's congenital amaurosis. 50 In addition, the use of intravitreal administration of siRNA was underwent clinical trials from different companies. 47 As a major pathogen in ophthalmic infections, HSV-1 can cause a variety of ocular diseases, ranging from mild to severe, and can even result in blindness. 21 We reveal that, in vitro, ICP4-siRNA could suppress HSV-1 reproduction in RPEs, which might be an effective way to inhibit HSV-1 replication in retinas using intravitreal injection.",

After 2 h, infected cells were transfected with small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). The cellular changes were imaged at 6 (left), 12 (middle) and 24 h (right) post-infection. Cytopathic effect (CPE) clearly increased, and many giant multinucleated cells could be seen in the cells treated with mock siRNA and cells untreated with siRNA (arrow); fewer CPE and giant multinucleated cells could be seen in cells transfected with ICP4-targeting siRNA.",
