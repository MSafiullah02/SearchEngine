The first phase is characterized by transient encephalitis within the first 2 weeks of infection due to rapid viral replication in the brain. In the second phase the virus moves to the spinal cord at 7\u201314 days post-infection (d.p.i.) and establishes lifelong infection in the white matter of the cord. The Daniel's strain (DA) of TMEV persists within oligodendrocytes, astrocytes and macrophages/microglia. Viral persistence results in chronic inflammation by lymphocytes and macrophages, as well as activation of central nervous system (CNS) glia, which leads to extensive demyelination, axonal degeneration and progressive neurological deficits starting at 2\u20133 months post-infection.",

            "text": "Theiler's virus induces the production of a variety of chemokines in the CNS\u2014molecules that regulate migration and function of inflammatory cells. Similar patterns of chemokine expression develop in the CNS after infections with different strains of TMEV and with other viruses (1\u201311). Some of the major chemokines are regulated on activation, normal T cell-expressed and secreted chemokine (RANTES; CCL5), monokine induced by IFN-\u03b3 (MIG; CXCL9), interferon-\u03b3 inducible protein-10 (IP-10; CXCL10), monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1; CCL2), macrophage inflammatory protein-1\u03b1 (MIP-1\u03b1; CCL3) and MIP-1\u03b2 (CCL4). Most are up-regulated within several days of infection and remain elevated as long as viral infection and/or tissue injury persists. A primary role for these chemokines is to facilitate infiltration of virus-reactive lymphocytes. For example, lymphocyte infiltration promoted by MIG and IP-10 during mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) infection serves to limit viral replication and reduce mortality (12\u201314). In contrast, inflammatory responses also potentially are injurious to normal tissues, and therefore under some conditions chemokine production could be harmful. Theiler's virus infection of SJL mice is one such example where the role of chemokines cannot be easily predicted because the inflammatory response has two prominent and contrasting effects. CD4 and CD8 lymphocytes are necessary for preventing mortality throughout infection, but their infiltration into the CNS over the long term also leads significantly to myelin and axonal destruction. Antiviral responses in SJL mice are insufficient to clear virus, at least in part due to a lack of virus reactivity of most infiltrating lymphocytes (15). Therefore, virus and the resulting inflammatory response persist lifelong in the spinal cord. The secondary development of autoreactivity might also play a role in chronic disease (16). Thus, chemokines probably exert both positive and negative effects concurrently in this model.",

Our protocol was to treat mice with one or two doses of neutralizing antiserum to either of these chemokines and examine the effects on viral load, cytokine mRNAs and spinal cord pathology 1 month later. In designing this protocol, our primary focus was spinal cord pathology because the degree of motor dysfunction correlates strongly with the extent of spinal cord injury (17, 18). Since CNS injury is a long-term manifestation of infection, a sufficiently long treatment period was required to detect changes in pathology if they developed. Moreover, by limiting the number of antiserum treatments we attempted to reduce immunopathology without significantly affecting virus load. Indeed, we found that virus expression increased only slightly, but counter to our hypothesis, spinal cord pathology also increased rather than decreased by 1-month post-treatment.",

At the described times mice were injected intra-peritoneally with 0.5 ml chemokine antiserum (provided by Tom Lane) or normal goat serum (Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA). Chemokine antisera were made by injection of rabbits (for MIG antiserum) or goats (for RANTES antiserum) with peptide\u2013keyhole limpet hemocyanin conjugates corresponding to the specific chemokines. The antisera reacted specifically with the cognate chemokines and blocked CD4 and CD8 lymphocyte migration in vivo in previous studies (7, 14, 19, 20). The antibodies also were expected to be efficacious during Theiler's virus infection because Ig delivered systemically are detectable in the CNS (21, 22).

Data from multiple experiments were combined because single and double antiserum administrations were considered to have similar effects. Single antibody injections are sufficient to neutralize target antigens in vivo (23), and the effective antibody concentration in the serum was unlikely to be significantly prolonged by a second injection (1\u20133 week Ig half-life), compared with the 4-week span of each experiment. The relatively late analysis was chosen to be able to detect possible changes in spinal cord pathology, which typically manifest many days or weeks following immunomodulatory treatments.

The neutralizing activities were confirmed using in vitro chemotaxis assays. Cells responsive to RANTES (splenocytes from MHV-infected mice) or MIG (300-19 cell line) were seeded into the upper chamber of transwell plates, and recombinant chemokines and antisera were placed in the bottom chamber.

Real-time RT\u2013PCR was performed with RNA isolated from homogenates of spinal cords and brain stems. Data from two, separate experiments were combined. In one experiment mice were treated with antiserum at 10 and 17 d.p.i. and analyzed at 56 d.p.i.

Average RNA levels for most genes examined were not significantly affected by antiserum treatment, including VP2 viral capsid protein, CXCR3 chemokine receptor, IFN-\u03b3, IL-2, IL-4 or GAPDH (Fig. 2). One exception was a modest increase in IL-10 mRNA by RANTES antiserum (Fig. 2D). When gene expression for each of these molecules was analyzed in the two experiments separately, only for IL-10 were mRNA levels different between treatment and control groups following two antiserum injections but not following a single injection.

Firstly, expression of IL-2 was inversely related to the expression of IL-10 (r = \u22120.58, P < 0.0001; Fig. 2E). Mice with high IL-2 levels had low IL-10 levels in the CNS, and vice versa. Secondly, analysis of the IL-2/IL-10 ratio revealed a shift toward IL-10 expression with anti-RANTES treatment (P = 0.02; Fig. 2F). Thirdly, we found that levels of both IL-2 and IL-10 correlated VP2. That is, IL-2 RNA decreased (r = \u22120.50, P = 0.01; Fig. 3A) and IL-10 increased (r = 0.88, P < 0.0001; Fig. 3B) in proportion to increasing levels of VP2 RNA. Finally, the IL-2/IL-10 ratio correlated strongly with levels of VP2 RNA (r = \u22120.73, P < 0.0001; Fig. 3C). Mice with the lowest ratio of IL-2/IL-10 had the highest levels of VP2. Interestingly, the cytokine RNA levels varied across only a 3-fold range (0.5 log units) while VP2 RNA levels varied across a 100-fold range (2 log units).

This type of analysis is the most informative measure of virulence, as viral antigen expression in the spinal cord has been shown to correlate with the extent of pathology in chronically infected mice (29\u201331). In contrast, infectious virus demonstrated by plaque assays starts to decline after 2 weeks of infection and is present only at very low levels in chronically infected mice, despite an abundance of viral antigen and RNA (29, 32). Mice were treated with antiserum on 12 and 18 d.p.i. and analyzed at 45 d.p.i. (27 days post-treatment interval). All mice had spinal cord pathology, despite some mice having very few infected cells in the sections that we sampled. Virus-infected cells were found exclusively in the white matter tracts of the spinal cord rather than the gray matter where neuronal cell bodies are located. Virus expression was measured first by counting the number of spinal cord quadrants with virus antigen-positive cells. This revealed that mice treated with MIG antiserum had a higher percentage of spinal cord quadrants with infected cells than mice treated with non-immune serum (P = 0.048; Fig. 4A). We also analyzed viral antigen by counting the total number of infected cells as a function of spinal cord area and found that RANTES antiserum-treated mice had more infected cells relative to the area sampled, compared with control mice (P = 0.048; Fig. 4B). Thus, anti-MIG treatment resulted in a more widespread infection in the spinal cord white matter, whereas anti-RANTES treatment produced a higher overall level of virus expression.

Lymphocytes infiltrated spinal cords extensively in all experimental groups and co-localized with virus-infected cells. CD4 lymphocytes were located in the perivasculature and the white matter parenchyma, whereas CD8 lymphocytes were found primarily in the white matter parenchyma.

Lymphocyte and macrophage infiltration into the CNS is vital for the control of TMEV but it also secondarily causes demyelination and axon destruction. The most logical hypothesis related to chemokine neutralization is that reducing immune cell infiltration would elicit a rise in virus but a decline in immunopathology. Looking at a time point when the consequences of antiserum treatment could be significantly manifested, we indeed found that RANTES neutralization and to a lesser extent MIG neutralization elevated virus expression but unexpectedly also caused more inflammation and demyelination in the spinal cord.

Virus expression is also the major determinant of CNS pathology. The present study showed that virus antigen expression correlated with the extent of spinal cord demyelination, which supports similar findings at later stages of disease (29\u201331).",

            "text": "Considering these central roles for virus in inducing chemokine expression and pathology, we hypothesize that the principal effect of anti-RANTES and anti-MIG was to reduce infiltration of antiviral lymphocytes and/or monocytes and that pathology increased by 1-month post-treatment as a response to higher virus expression at the protein level. Activated CD4 cells with a Th1 phenotype are the preferential targets of RANTES and MIG (33, 37, 38) and are also known to be important for virus control. Thus, a decline in antiviral activity is expected from anti-RANTES and anti-MIG treatments. Also in support of our hypothesis, virus titers and CNS pathology increase following antibody-mediated depletion or genetic knockout of CD4 lymphocytes (11, 23). Anti-chemokine treatments had subtler effects than total CD4 depletion, likely because a variety of chemokines contribute to infiltration of lymphocytes or macrophages during infection.",

(35) similarly found discordance between viral RNA, which remains high and relatively constant throughout the life of SJL mice, and infectious virus, which starts to decline as early as 3 weeks post-infection (32). Thus, viral RNA levels appear to be less responsive than virus antigen or infectious virus (plaques) to immunomodulation. An important question still to be resolved in the Theiler's field is the mechanism by which virus determines the extent of CNS pathology. One hypothesis is that TMEV causes direct cytolysis of CNS cells. The DA strain of Theiler's virus persists in oligodendrocytes, astrocytes and microglia/macrophages, but direct cytolysis of these cells appears to be limited (39, 40). In immunostained spinal cord sections we found only occasional, highly distended, infected cells. In addition, immunocompromised RAG\u2212/\u2212 mice infected with Theiler's virus do not show significant demyelination prior to death at 3 weeks post-infection, even when virus is injected directly into the spinal cord, implying a limited degree of cytolysis (M.R. unpublished observations).",

            "text": "The more likely explanation is that the extent of virus expression determines the strength of the immune reaction, which in turn elicits secondary injury to myelin and other CNS cells. One of the best examples of this mechanism involves the adoptive transfer of immunocompetent splenocytes into infected, immunodeficient SCID mice (41). Increasing the number of transferred splenocytes is able to prevent TMEV-induced mortality but also increases immunopathology. Whereas transfer of very high numbers of splenocytes can clear virus in SCID mice, SJL mice typically are unable to clear Theiler's virus. Lymphocytes reactive to the major Theiler's virus epitopes are rare in SJL and other susceptible mouse strains, in contrast to resistant strains such as C57BL/10 mice (15). The virus-specific response of only a minority of lymphocytes might partially explain why we did not observe obvious alterations in CD4 or CD8 lymphocyte infiltration by immunostaining. Another possible explanation is that a significant number of infiltrating lymphocytes or monocytes/macrophages might have been responding secondarily to tissue damage or might have had affinities for other chemokines. We also recognize that chemokine-neutralizing activity might have subsided over time and that specific lymphocyte infiltration might have rebounded by 1-month post-treatment.",

Finding strong correlations within this context suggests that the changes in IL-2 and IL-10 were biologically relevant. A narrow window of regulation might explain why it has been difficult to associate the various aspects of Theiler's disease (e.g. susceptibility versus resistance) or multiple sclerosis (e.g. inactive versus active) with particular cytokine profiles (42\u201350). It is tempting to speculate that these changes were indicative of the proportions of Th1 and Th2 lymphocytes. For example, an increase in virus concurrent with a decrease in IL-2 is consistent with the hypothesis that IL-2-expressing Th1 lymphocytes are important for virus control. However, a suitable explanation probably is more complicated because two other cytokines representative of Th1 and Th2 lymphocytes, IFN-\u03b3 and IL-4, did not show correlations with viral RNA. Glial cells also express many of these cytokines as well as the chemokine receptor, CXCR3, which confounds conclusions about the specific responses of infiltrating cells (51\u201354).",

A question for future studies is whether the increases in virus expression and pathology are sustained, or whether antiviral mechanisms are able to reduce these parameters back to a level characteristic of untreated mice. Another question is whether more neurological dysfunction eventually develops in mice in which chemokines are neutralized. Chemokine neutralization, although not immediately impacting function, may accelerate the onset and eventual severity of deficits. From the standpoint of human disease, chemokine neutralization represents a promising therapy for autoimmune diseases where lymphocyte dysregulation and autoreactivity are the primary etiologies. In contrast, our findings caution against the use of chemokine neutralization where viral etiologies are suspected. Even mild and apparently benign treatments may have adverse effects later in disease.",
