Nasopharyngeal specimens were obtained at the discretion of the clinician caring for the patient and transported to the laboratory in MicroTest M4-RT medium (Remel, Lenexa, KS) within 1 h. Specimens obtained overnight were held at 4 \u00b0C for up to 8 h. Otherwise, specimens were processed by the laboratory on receipt. hMPV testing was performed using a reverse transcriptase\u2013polymerase chain reaction assay (RT\u2013PCR) with primers specific for the hMPV F gene as previously described.11 RSV, influenza A and B, parainfluenza-1, -2 and -3 and adenovirus were identified by a cytospin-enhanced direct immunofluorescence assay (DFA).13 Nasopharyngeal specimens required a minimum of 25 columnar epithelial cells to be adequate for DFA testing. Viral cultures were performed, if requested by the clinician, using primary rhesus monkey kidney, A549 and MRC-5 cell cultures, according to published methods.13 These techniques are unable to identify either rhinovirus or coronaviruses. Patients were excluded from the analysis if a nasopharyngeal specimen was unavailable, not obtained within the first 5 days of hospitalization or inadequate for DFA testing. Medical records were reviewed to obtain information regarding the patients' clinical course of their acute illness and past medical history. If a patient was hospitalized more than once for an acute exacerbation of COPD during the study period, only the first acute exacerbation hospitalization was included since the duration of hMPV shedding has not been well described.",

Concern has been raised regarding the duration of viral nucleic acid carriage and hence the specificity of PCR based diagnostic testing in patients with COPD.30 However, hMPV is only rarely identified in patients lacking signs or symptoms of an acute respiratory illnesses. Williams, et al. identified hMPV in only 1 (1.2%) of 86 children without evidence for a respiratory tract infection.10 Furthermore, the recent study by Beckham et al. failed to identify any hMPV infections in a group of COPD patients who experienced an acute respiratory illness.18 This suggests that the identification of hMPV from a patient experiencing an exacerbation of COPD more likely represents the etiology for the exacerbation rather than an unrelated epiphenomena.",
