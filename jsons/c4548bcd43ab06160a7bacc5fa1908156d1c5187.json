If the protocol and plan of research work are prepared according to the requirements of a particular journal, one is already a step ahead when it comes to the final writing of the paper. However, one must remember that such meticulous planning does not ensure that an article will be accepted for publication in the preferred journal; it is important to have a shortlist of three or four journals when you start writing.",

            "text": "A key determinant in the choice of a journal is the authors' own assessment of the importance of their work. Most research falls into two categories: (1) incremental research (i.e. research that builds on existing knowledge) or (2) replication of work that has been done previously. Manuscripts dealing with incremental research are considered more important, since these advance science, i.e. they improve our understanding of a disease or its treatment. Hence, a manuscript that adds to existing knowledge is more likely to be considered favourably by a high-impact journal. Replication of findings is an important concept in biomedical sciences. But journal editors are not always interested in manuscripts based on work carried out in previous studies. A replication study on a topic of recent or current global interest might be accepted in a top-or medium-level journal as their readers are interested in looking for articles that deal with similar problems from all over the world. However, once many articles on a particular topic have been published, new ones are considered less favourably, unless they have a new message. These may evince greater interest if a very different population group is reported on, and particularly if your results differ from those recorded in, previous papers. Hence, you need to choose a journal, based on how much similar work has already been published, by descending an informal pecking order of journals in the field if there are already many replicative publications.",

However, there is always the possibility that the findings or reasoning followed in such original work will turn out to be unfounded and fail to influence science in the long run. Innovative work often challenges existing knowledge and dogmas and may face resistance from peers. An element of chance operates for such papers. If the work is perceived as novel and is appreciated by the peer reviewers and the editorial team, it may be published in a high-impact journal, such as Science or Nature. For instance, the article describing the discovery of hepatitis C virus was published in Science [1] . On the other hand, the paper describing the discovery of Helicobacter pylori (then called Campylobacter pyloridis) was rejected as an original article. The report was published as a letter in The Lancet [2] in 1983; in 2005 the authors received the Nobel Prize for their work!",

Journals with a wider scope usually have a large readership. They have a higher frequency of publication and faster turnaround times, both from submission to acceptance and from acceptance to publication. However, the wider the scope of a journal, the more submissions it receives, and the harder it is to get published in it. It is worth remembering that though general medical journals have a wide readership, they may not be read by many specialists; hence their editors often do not encourage the publication of highly specialized papers. If your manuscript addresses a specialist topic, a specialist journal is more likely to publish it. Also, these journals are read by specialists; hence, if your paper addresses their interest, they are more likely to read it.",

In addition, a top international journal might well reject your manuscript, but a lower-ranking regional journal is more likely to accept it. The reverse is also true.

Hence, journals included in this database are believed to be more prestigious than those that are not. This database also has a wide reach; its search engine, PubMed (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Pubmed), is the de facto starting point for all biomedical researchers to search the published literature. It also includes abstracts of articles and links to the various journal sites hosting the complete article.

However, over the years, it has been used not only to compare journals, but also to assess research outputs of individuals and institutions. These latter uses are clearly inappropriate; however, even as a measure of journal quality, the impact factor has a number of limitations. First, the impact factors vary widely between scientific disciplines and fields, so direct comparisons are not truly valid; for instance, journals in fast-moving areas such as immunology have much higher impact factors than those in traditional fields such as physiology. Second, review articles often receive a disproportionately large number of citations compared to original research; thus, journals with a large number of review articles tend to have higher impact factors. Furthermore, the number of citations varies greatly for different papers published in a particular journal, with a large proportion of articles receiving no citation; the use of arithmetic mean for such data is fraught with problems. Finally, the impact factors are subject to manipulation [5, 6] .",

However, the advent of 'open access journals' has seen many journals charge for all the original papers they publish (see Chap. 19 on 'Open access journals'). The authors have to pay these charges after the manuscript has been accepted for publication. In exchange, the articles are freely available to readers. Some journals allow authors to retain a degree of copyright to their work (see Chap. 10 on 'Copyright issues').

However, negotiation is an option that might result in a complete or partial waiver of publication charges, particularly if the work was done in a limited-resource setting or if the funding agency does not cover such charges.

The numerator includes all citations to any articles published in the 2-year period, whereas the denominator includes only the articles published in the 2-year period that are considered 'citable' as defined by the publisher. Citable articles include research articles, reviews and other longer articles, whereas editorials, commentaries and letters to the editor are excluded. Other types of articles may be less easily categorized. Box 16.2 Calculation of the Impact Factor of a Journal Let us assume that: Number of citable papers published in a journal during the year 2012 = A1 Number of citable papers published in a journal during the year 2013 = A2 Number of citations to the above papers in journals in the Science Citation Index during the year 2014 = B Then: impact factor of the journal for 2014 = B/(A1 + A2).",
