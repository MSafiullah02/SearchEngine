AGP is the major Performance of diagnostic tests for FIP taken for postmortem examination and histopathology and IHC were performed as described below. The details of the tests included in this study are as follows. Analysis of the effusions: Approximately 2 mL of fluid was placed in an EDTA-coated tube. Cells were counted using an impedance counter (Hemat 8, SEAC, Calenzano, Firenze, Italy) . Then 50 to 100 \u03bcL of fluid was cytocentrifuged (Cytospin 2, Shandon Scientific, Runcorn, Cheshire, UK) at 130g for 10 minutes, and the remaining effusion was centrifuged (500g for 8 minutes), to obtain the cell-free supernatant used to evaluate the total protein by the biuret method with an automated analyser (Cobas Mira Classic, Roche Diagnostics Basel, Switzerland), to perform electrophoresis using the same method described below for serum and to estimate the specific gravity using a portable refractometer (Clinical Refractometer 5711-2020, Sch\u00fcco, Tokyo, Japan). Cytocentrifuged slides were stained with May Gr\u00fcnwald-Giemsa, cover slipped and examined under a light microscope. Serum protein electrophoresis: This was performed using an automated system (Genio, Interlab Srl, Rome, Italy). Cellulose acetate electrophoresis was run at room temperature in a buffer solution (Tris buffer >5%, sodium 5,5-diethylbarbiturate <1%, pH \u22658) for 16 minutes at 140 V. Strips were stained with Ponceau red, destained, diaphanised in appropriate solutions provided by the manufacturer and tested by densitometry to obtain electrophoretograms and the percentage area under each peak. AGP: AGP concentrations were measured using a radial immunodiffusion (SRID) kit (Tridelta Development Ltd, Maynooth, Kildare, Ireland). Five microlitres of each serum sample or of standard solutions containing 0\u00b75 and 2\u00b70 mg/mL of feline AGP, respectively, were put in each well of a multi-well SRID plate. After incubation (48 hours at room temperature), the diameter of precipitation rings was measured. Values of the two standard solutions were used to design a standard curve. Values from the case samples were then plotted to extrapolate absolute AGP levels, expressed as mg/mL. Serology: The presence of anti-FCoV antibodies was assessed using an indirect immunofluorescence test performed on 10 multi-well slides produced at the University of Zurich according to Osterhaus and others (1977) , by coating each well with 4\u00b75\u00d710\u00b3 PD-5 cells, half of which were infected with swine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (serologically cross-reacting with FCoVs). Twofold dilutions (1:25 to 1:400) of each serum sample were prepared and 20 \u00b5L of each dilution was applied to the wells. After incubation (30 minutes, 37\u00b0C in a moist chamber), slides were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), dried and 15 \u00b5L of fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated rabbit-anticat immunoglobulin (Nordic Immunological Laboratories, Tilburg, The Netherlands) was added to each well. After incubation (30 minutes, 37\u00b0C in a moist chamber), slides were washed, dried, cover-slipped with PBS and Kaiser's glycerin (1:3 v/v) and observed on a fluorescence microscope. When the dilutions showed a clear fluorescent signal in about half of the cells, they were judged as positive. Samples that were still positive at a 1:400 dilution were further diluted on a twofold basis until they were negative. Histopathology/IHC: Tissue samples were fixed in buffered 10% iso-osmotic formalin and embedded in paraffin.

In this study, both the history and clinical presentation could be misleading even if they were highly consistent or inconsistent with FIP. Likewise, macroscopic and cytological aspects of the effusion were often not considered pathognomonic, as It is commonly accepted that the diagnosis of FIP should be based on histopathological features (fibrinous polyserositis, infiltration of mononuclear cells and/or pyogranulomatous parenchymal foci; Kipar and others 1998 , Addie and others 2004 , Pedersen 2009 ). In this study, however, histopathology proved highly specific for FIP but was not a sensitive diagnostic test as it failed to confirm FIP in most affected cases and it had a poor concordance with IHC, which is considered to have the highest specificity for diagnosing FIP (Pedersen 2009 ). As such, the detection of lesions clearly consistent with FIP is intrinsically conclusive, but when the interpretation of lesions is not clear, FIP cannot be excluded. There is limited information available on how to approach these cases when IHC is not available. Although our study is limited by the small number of cases, the measurement of serum AGP concentration appeared to be most helpful as it was the only diagnostic test in complete concordance with IHC. However, it must be pointed out that AGP is an acute phase protein and, by definition, its serum concentration increases in any inflammatory/infectious condition (Kajikawa and others 1999 , Ceron and others 2005 , Paltrinieri 2008 or even in non-inflammatory disease such as lymphoma (Correa and others 2001) or other tumours (Selting and others 2000) . The excellent performance of AGP in this study could thus be biased because of the lack of cases with other severe inflammatory diseases. Nevertheless, two factors must be they were also observed in inflammatory conditions other than FIP. Cytology of effusions is therefore not specific and cannot be used to support a diagnosis of FIP when histopathology is doubtful. Nonetheless, the cytological evaluation of effusions is always mandatory in the investigation as it can identify diseases other than FIP (e.g. tumours or septic effusions) that were not included in this study. Direct staining of FCoVs within macrophages by immunofluorescence in cytocentrifuged effusions is considered the most specific tool to confirm FIP (Hartmann 2005) . However, it could not be applied in non-effusive forms or in poorly cellular samples as those detected in some cats in this study. In addition, although this test was first established by our group years ago (Cammarata Parodi and others 1993), it is not routinely performed in our laboratory, as it is time consuming and other tests, such as SPE or AGP, can provide information that strongly support the diagnosis of FIP in cats with a high pretest probability of disease (Paltrinieri and others 2007) . Performance of diagnostic tests for FIP taken into account in evaluating AGP concentrations to support a clinical diagnosis of FIP: the magnitude of the increase and the pretest probability of FIP. The cut-off employed in this study was as suggested by Duthie and others (1997) who noted that, although AGP can increase in any inflammatory condition, the increase is more pronounced in FIP than in other diseases. This has been confirmed by other studies others 2004, Paltrinieri and others 2007) and ultimately also by the results of this study. In a recent study (Paltrinieri and others 2007) , it was demonstrated that AGP can be used to support a clinical diagnosis of FIP according to the Bayesian approach. When the pretest probability of FIP is high (when most of the in vivo or postmortem tests are consistent with but not absolutely conclusive of FIP), a \"positive test\" (a high AGP value) can increase the posttest probability of disease. In other words, although AGP alone cannot be used to confirm a clinical suspicion of FIP, it could be confirmatory when FIP is probable but not definitely diagnosed based on other clinicopathological findings or on postmortem examination results.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 518, "end": 539, "text": "Kipar and others 1998", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 540, "end": 563, "text": ", Addie and others 2004", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 564, "end": 579, "text": ", Pedersen 2009", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 855, "end": 869, "text": "(Pedersen 2009", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 1500, "end": 1525, "text": "(Kajikawa and others 1999", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1526, "end": 1549, "text": ", Ceron and others 2005", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1550, "end": 1568, "text": ", Paltrinieri 2008", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1622, "end": 1646, "text": "(Correa and others 2001)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1664, "end": 1689, "text": "(Selting and others 2000)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2418, "end": 2433, "text": "(Hartmann 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 2908, "end": 2937, "text": "(Paltrinieri and others 2007)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3193, "end": 3217, "text": "Duthie and others (1997)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3395, "end": 3423, "text": "others 2004, Paltrinieri and", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3424, "end": 3436, "text": "others 2007)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3505, "end": 3534, "text": "(Paltrinieri and others 2007)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "In conclusion, the detection of lesions consistent with FIP is a confirmatory test in cases with atypical clinical presentation.
