            "text": "Feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) was originally isolated in 1986 from a feline leukemia virus (FeLV)-negative cat with chronic opportunistic infections [22] . Based on biological and morphological similarities between FIV and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), FIV infection of domestic cats is now considered to be an important small-animal model for studying prophylactic and therapeutic strategies against HIV infections [10, 16, 23, 30] . During the early acute stage of HIV infection, bursts of viral replication and high levels of plasma viremia are observed, then HIV infection enters a long clinically asymptomatic stage [7] . Similar to HIV infection, plasma viremia is detected during the early stage of FIV infection. Thereafter, a long clinically asymptomatic stage continues, during which the number of CD4 + T cells gradually decreases, suggesting the eventual induction of clinical signs of AIDS [6, 17, 33] . The induction of HIV-specific CD8 + cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) is important in maintaining the asymptomatic stage [25] . This CTL is a major-histocompatibility complex (MHC) of a class I molecule-restriction and destroys HIV-infected cells by recognizing the epitopes of Gag, reverse transcriptase (RT), Nef or envelope (ENV) proteins [18] . CD8 + T cells can also control HIV infection without killing the infected cell. This inhibition of HIV replication is noncytotoxic and does not decrease the number of HIV-infected cells [26, 28] . Anti-HIV activity has been demonstrated using a trans-well culture device in which CD8 + T cells were separated from infected CD4 + T cells by a semipermeable membrane, and by exposing infected CD4 + T cells to filtered supernatants from cultured CD8 + T cells [3, 27] . Furthermore, this inhibition can be induced using MHC-mismatched CD8 + T cells [3, 21, 29] . Therefore, the anti-HIV activity of these CD8 + T cells is not due to CTL activity but to soluble factor(s) produced by the CD8 + T cells. Thus, to maintain the asymptomatic stage of HIV infection, the non MHC-restricted noncytotoxic anti-HIV response of CD8 + T cells together with MHC-restricted CTL is important.",

            "text": "As in HIV infection, a viral-specific CTL response was observed following experimental infection with FIV prior to the onset of humoral immunity [1, 24] . In addition, anti-FIV CD8 + T cells with non-CTL characteristics have been observed in FIV-infected cats. We reported that this CD8 + T cell non-cytolytic anti-FIV activity is more effectively induced when CD8 + T cells are in direct contact with the target cells and when CD8 + T cells are induced by autologous CD8 + T cells rather than by allogeneic CD8 + T cells, and that the activity is mediated by soluble factors produced by CD8 + T cells [12] . Jeng et al. [15] detected this CD8 + T cell anti-FIV activity during the asymptomatic stage of FIV infection, but not during the acute stage. However, Bucci et al. [4] and Flynn et al. [8] also detected the activity during the acute stage of FIV infection. Therefore, to increase understanding of the properties of CD8 + T cell anti-FIV activity, we compared this activity between the period during which it became detectable and during which humoral immunity was detected. We also investigated the presence or absence of this activity in the lymph nodes and spleen. Furthermore, we examined which step(s) of the FIV replication cycle is affected by this antiviral activity by comparing the amount of FIV p24 antigen production, the number of FIV proviral DNA copies and the amount of FIV mRNA produced in the cells.",

Also, cultured cells were collected on days 12 and 15 of the culture to determine the number of FIV proviral DNA copies and the FIV mRNA copies in cells.

            "text": "The induction of FIV-specific humoral immune responses such as neutralizing antibody and cell-mediated immune responses such as CD8 + cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses is considered to be important for protection against FIV infection [9, 13, 14, 31, 32] . Another cell-mediated immune response (noncytolytic antiviral CD8 + T cells) has recently been implicated in the control of FIV replication during the asymptomatic phase of infection [12, 15] . This anti-FIV activity of CD8 + T cells appears during the acute stage of FIV infection [4, 8] . However, the period during which induction of this activity begins remains unknown. We experimentally infected four SPF cats with FIV, and investigated when the anti-FIV activity of CD8 + T cells appeared. Levels of FIV p24 antigen production were very high in CD8 + T cell-depleted PBMC 5-7 weeks after Fig. 3 . Anti-FIV activity of CD8 + T cells derived from lymph nodes and spleen cells. After FIV inoculation, mononuclear cells were collected from the blood, lymph nodes, and spleen cells from cats A32 and A44 after 11 weeks, from A43 after 13 weeks, and from A30 after 22 weeks. Anti-FIV activity of CD8 + T cells was examined. Mononuclear cells were divided into CD8 + T cell-depleted (\u1b79) and unseparated mononuclear cells (\u1b7a), then cultured at 37 \u2022 C. Culture supernatants were monitored for FIV p24 antigen at 3-day intervals. Cell cultures were performed in duplicate, and the results were expressed as mean OD values at 650 nm FIV infection in three of the four infected cats, indicating that FIV replication is inhibited by CD8 + T cells. Humoral immunity became positive 5-6 weeks after inoculation of these cats, which was consistent with the period when anti-FIV activity was induced in CD8 + T cells. In the remaining cat (No. A30), FIV was isolated from PBL six weeks after experimental infection, but humoral immunity was not detected until 11 weeks. Weak CD8 + T cell anti-FIV activity was detected about 11 weeks after inoculation in this cat, but the activity was consistently weak until 22 weeks after inoculation. This phenomenon was considered to be related to a poor immune response including humoral immunity. Anti-HIV activity of CD8 + T cells in HIV uninfected individuals has been reported [20] , which may represent crossreactivity with non-HIV antigens. However, the induction of anti-FIV activity of CD8 + T cells was consistent with the induction of Fig. 5 . Changes in the amount of FIV p24 antigen in culture supernatant and numbers of FIV proviral DNA and FIV mRNA copies in cells determined by adding autologous CD8 + T cells to CD8 + T cell-depleted PBMC cultured for 12 days. A CD8 + T celldepleted PBMC (1\u00d710 6 cells) were cultured, then FIV p24 antigen levels in culture supernatants were measured every three days. After 12 days, when FIV p24 antigen levels began to increase, cells were divided into two groups and autologous CD8 + T cells (1\u00d710 6 cells) were added to one of group and cultured. CD8 + T cell-depleted PBMC; \u1b7a, reconstituted CD8 + T cell-depleted PBMC with autologous CD8 + T cells. B Number of FIV proviral DNA copies in cells.

They considered that spleen cells in domestic carnivores include high numbers of \u2425 \u2426 T cells, thus explaining the absence of activity in splenic lymphoblasts. However, we detected anti-FIV activity in CD8 + T cells among splenic lymphoblasts in two (A32, A43) of three cats (A32, A43, A44) with high anti-FIV activity in the lymph nodes. Although the ratios of \u2425 \u2426 T cells in spleen cells in these cats were unknown, we confirmed the anti-FIV activity in CD8 + T cells among spleen cells. Bucci et al.

The anti-FIV activity of CD8 + T cells was also effective against cells with integrated FIV proviral DNA. Accordingly, this anti-FIV activity affects the step after FIV proviral DNA is integrated into cellular DNA. Therefore, CD8 + T cell-depleted PBL were cultured and CD8 + T cells were added when the level of FIV p24 antigen began to increase in the culture supernatant. We then examined the effects on the amount of FIV p24 antigen produced, the number of FIV proviral DNA copies and the amount of FIV mRNA generated in the cells. To determine the amount of FIV mRNA in the cells, we performed QC-PCR of cDNA synthesized by reverse transcription from mRNA extracted from infected cells and measured the number of copies. Because the efficiency of reverse transcription is not considered in this method, the absolute amount of the original mRNA cannot be estimated, but the relative amount among various samples can be compared. Adding CD8 + T cells to the culture did not change the number of FIV proviral DNA copies, but decreased the FIV p24 antigen level in the culture supernatant and the number of FIV mRNA copies in the cells. These findings suggested that this anti-FIV activity acts at the level of FIV mRNA synthesis from FIV proviral DNA. HIV replication is not inhibited by the CD8 + T cell antiviral activity through blocking viral absorption, but rather through blocking HIV mRNA transcription [19] . Furthermore, the finding that the number of FIV proviral DNA copies was not decreased despite decreases in the amount of FIV p24 antigen and the number of FIV mRNA copies supported the notion that the anti-FIV activity of CD8 + T cells is induced by a non-cytolytic mechanism.",

            "text": "CTL typically recognize viral antigens expressed on the surface of infected cells in the context of an appropriate MHC molecule and kill these cells by lysis or apoptosis, and this response plays a central role in eliminating virus-infected cells from the body. The non-cytolytic anti-FIV activity of CD8 + T cells decreased the expression of viral antigens, which interfered with the beneficial CTL activity. Considering the effect of this non-cytolytic response on CTL activity, this anti-FIV activity of CD8 + T cells may confuse its role in eliminating the virus from the body in FIV-infected cats. However, HIV-specific CTL are largely involved in a decrease in CD4 + T cells, and the harmfulness of CTL has been noted in the pathogenesis of AIDS [34] . To prevent the onset of AIDS, a dynamic balance between the virus and target cells must be maintained. In other words, HIV/FIV replication should be maintained at low levels. Vigorous viral replication induces vigorous viral mutation. By suppressing viral replication in the cell, CD8 + T cells would prevent mutations that could lead to highly cytopathic strains, that may play a role in FIV pathogenesis.",
