Despite recent advances in terms of management, sepsis remains a life-threatening condition with poor prognosis. The risk factors for sepsis usually include patientrelated physiological characteristics, underlying diseases, or clinical treatment backgrounds. Patients with one or more of these factors are susceptible to sepsis. The most vulnerable are the elderly and infant populations; patients with chronic diseases, severe trauma, or burns; individuals who are immunocompromised or receiving immunosuppressive therapy; and malnourished and debilitated patients. The early diagnosis of sepsis is critical because mortality increases by 7.6% for each hour that appropriate antimicrobial therapy is delayed [1] . However, the accurate and timely detection of sepsis remains a great challenge because of its various nonspecific clinical manifestations and its complex and indeterminate pathophysiology. Therefore, neither microbial detection, which is considered the gold standard for identifying infection, nor traditional biomarkers can fulfill the existing need for the early diagnosis and management of sepsis [2] .",

Sepsis develops when the initial appropriate host response to an infection becomes amplified and then dysregulated [3] . The host immune defenses determine the fate of infecting organisms. That is, these organisms could remain localized; be phagocytosed and removed by immunocytes, leading to the release of pathogen components into the circulation; or multiply in local tissue and enter the bloodstream, resulting in bacteremia and sepsis. The pathogen and its structural components not only cause extensive changes in both the innate and acquired immune responses but also affect the nervous, endocrine, respiratory, circulatory, metabolic systems, etc. [3] . Traditional biomarkers for sepsis are mainly derived from this host immune/inflammatory response. Various high-throughput omics technologies facilitate comprehensive screening of sepsis-specific biomarkers.

For instance, CRP is frequently used to identify infection and sepsis [2] . The plasma concentration of CRP is positively correlated with the risk of organ dysfunction and death [13, 14] . However, the level of CRP cannot accurately reflect the severity of infection and sepsis because it increases during minor infection or remains high even after the time course of infection [2] . The level of CRP may also increase during an inflammatory response to noninfectious events, such as myocardial infarction, tumorigenesis, or operation. These findings suggest that CRP lacks specificity as an early-stage sepsis biomarker. By contrast, the elevation of PCT is listed as a diagnostic criterion for sepsis [15] . A recent meta-analysis that included 30 studies has revealed that PCT has a mean sensitivity of 0.77, a mean specificity of 0.79, and an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.85 [16] . Despite its value for the early diagnosis of sepsis in critically ill patients, PCT remains unsuitable as a definitive diagnostic measure [16] .",

In a prospective cohort study of 151 patients with systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), suPAR, sTREM-1, MIF, PCT, neutrophil count, and CRP were used as biomarkers to detect the bacterial cause of inflammation, with AUCs of 0.5, 0.61, 0.63, 0.72, 0.74, and 0.81, respectively [17] . The combined AUC of the six biomarkers was determined to be 0.88 using a statistical estimation of the optimum linear combination test and the associated maximum AUC [18] . This result showed that using the six biomarkers simultaneously had better diagnostic accuracy than using any of the biomarkers alone for detecting the bacterial versus nonbacterial causes of inflammation. In another prospective study of critically ill patients [19] , a bioscore that combined the polymorphonuclear neutrophil CD64 index with PCT and sTREM-1 serum levels was used to diagnose sepsis with an AUC of 0.97. This result showed that the biomarkers had better performance when used in combination than when used alone. The diagnostic accuracy of the bioscore was confirmed in a validation cohort, with 90.9% of patients being correctly classified. Although the combination of biomarkers improves diagnostic sensitivity and specificity, factors including time, cost, sample availability, and the practicability of the detection method limit the application of this approach in clinical practice.",

For example, burn patients with TLR4 and TNF-\u03b1 polymorphisms are 1.8 times more likely to develop severe sepsis than patients who are homozygous; however, this increase in susceptibility is not significantly associated with mortality [28] . TLR1 SNPs are associated with increased mortality in patients with Gram-positive bacterial sepsis after traumatic injury; thus, they may serve as a novel marker for the risk of death in critically injured patients [22] . A recent study has revealed an association between the vascular endothelial growth factor + 936CC genotype and risk of developing acute kidney injury in patients with severe sepsis [30] . Genome-wide SNP genotyping assays enable the accurate detection of hundreds of thousands of SNPs in a single experiment [34, 35] . Therefore, such assays are valuable to the identification of novel sepsis susceptibility-associated SNPs.",

In another study, microarray and multiplex tandem PCR were used to evaluate transcriptional profiles in circulating white blood cells of ICU septic patients, postsurgical patients, and healthy control subjects [51] . A panel of 42 gene expression markers was identified, and the prediction of sepsis from a mixed inflammatory cell population had an AUC between 86% and 92%.

Serum and plasma levels of miRNAs are consistent among individuals of the same species; moreover, miRNAs are resistant to RNase A digestion and remain stable even after multiple freeze-thaw cycles and long-term storage [55, 56] . This stability makes miRNAs potentially useful candidates for diagnostic and other clinical applications. Although the source of circulating miRNAs is still unclear, they have been implicated in a wide range of diseases, including cancer [57, 58] , trauma [59, 60] , acute pancreatitis [61] , and hepatitis [62] .",

The combined assessment of serum levels, sepsis stage, and Sepsis-Related Organ Failure Assessment scores of miR-574-5p has a better predictive value than any single above-mentioned indicator for mortality. In addition, the serum levels of miR-146a and miR-223 are significantly reduced in septic patients compared with SIRS patients and healthy control subjects; therefore, these miRNAs can potentially serve as novel, highly sensitive, and specific biomarkers for sepsis [67] .

Compared with the rats that survived, those that did not survive exhibited lower levels of free fatty acids. This finding can be explained by a heightened systemic demand for energy during sepsis, suggesting that the level of free fatty acids can serve as a useful bioindicator. Moreover, an increase in the level of certain polyunsaturated fatty acids was observed; this increase can be indicative of an increased anti-inflammatory response.

Several issues need to be considered before omics-based approaches can be efficiently used for the diagnosis and monitoring of sepsis in clinical settings. First, appropriate, highly specific biomarkers with high diagnostic value must be identified. The gold standard for determining infection still depends on microbial detection, which can provide a false negative result even in patients exhibiting the clinical manifestations of infection, because of the mildness of the disease, the load/type/growth capacity of pathogens, and the use of antibiotics [76] . Conversely, false positive results may be observed because of sample contamination. Therefore, perfections to this standard diagnostic method are needed.",
