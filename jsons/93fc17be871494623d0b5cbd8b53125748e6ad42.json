            "text": "HBV infection initiates hepatitis B and promotes liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. IFN-\u03b1 is commonly used in hepatitis B therapy, but how it inhibits HBV is not fully understood. We screened 285 human interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) for anti-HBV activity using a cell-based assay, which revealed several anti-HBV ISGs. Among these ISGs, SAMD4A was the strongest suppressor of HBV replication. We found the binding site of SAMD4A in HBV RNA, which was a previously unidentified Smaug recognition region (SRE) sequence conserved in HBV variants. SAMD4A binds to the SRE site in viral RNA to trigger its degradation. The SAM domain in SAMD4A is critical for RNA binding and the C-terminal domain of SAMD4A is required for SAMD4A anti-HBV function. Human SAMD4B is a homolog of human SAMD4A but is not an ISG, and the murine genome encodes SAMD4. All these SAMD4 proteins suppressed HBV replication when overexpressed in vitro and in vivo. We also showed that knocking out the Samd4 gene in hepatocytes led to a higher level of HBV replication in mice and AAV-delivered SAMD4A expression reduced the virus titer in HBVproducing transgenic mice. In addition, a database analysis revealed a negative correlation between the levels of SAMD4A/B and HBV in patients. Our data suggest that SAMD4A is an important anti-HBV ISG for use in IFN therapy of hepatitis B and that the levels of SAMD4A/B expression are related to HBV sensitivity in humans.",

            "text": "Human hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, the major cause of hepatitis B disease, remains a global public health problem. 1 HBV is a hepatotropic DNA virus with a 3.2 kb partially double-stranded genome. After the HBV receptor sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP)-mediated viral particle enters hepatocytes, 2,3 the viral capsid is translocated to the nucleus. Then, the viral genomic relaxes and circular DNA (rcDNA) is released into the nucleus and converted into covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA). 4 The cccDNA functions as a minichromosome and four viral RNA species are transcribed: a 3.5 kb mRNA (pregenomic RNA), 2.4 kb mRNA (preS1 HBs RNA), 2.1 kb mRNA (preS2/S HBs RNA), and 0.7 kb mRNA (HBX RNA), which are initiated by different promoters but share the same poly-A tail. The viral proteins HBV e antigen (HBeAg), HBcAg, and P are encoded by the 3.5 kb RNA. A large surface protein is encoded by 2.4 kb RNA. Middle-sized and small surface proteins (HBsAg) are mainly encoded by the 2.1 kb RNA and HBX is encoded by the 0.7 kb RNA. 5, 6 Nucleoside/nucleotide analogs and interferon (IFN-\u03b1) are two major clinical therapies for HBV-infected patients. However, drugresistant viruses often appear after long-term treatment by nucleoside/nucleotide analogs and fewer than 40% of patients benefit from IFN therapy. 7, 8 IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) are believed to defend against extracellular pathogens. 9 A few ISGs have been reported to limit HBV replication directly and the mechanism of IFN-\u03b1 therapy is not fully understood. 10 Hence, further identification of anti-HBV ISGs is important for understanding and improving IFN therapy.",

SAMD4A is a mammalian homolog of Drosophila Smaug, which was reported to be a posttranscriptional repressor regulating processes such as maternal RNA destabilization, the maternal-to-zygotic transition, and early embryo development. 11 The sterile alpha motif (SAM) domain contained in SAMD4A is a highly conserved domain shown to bind directly to an RNA stem loop, which is also known as a Smaug recognition region (SRE). 12 SAMD4A is involved in neuron RNA granule formation 13 and translational repression in mammals. 14, 15 High levels of SAMD4A expression reduce the nuclear accumulation of CUGBP1 in myoblasts from DM1",

In this study, we demonstrated that SAMD4A and its homolog, SAMD4B, can inhibit HBV replication. This inhibition is mediated by the binding of SAMD4A to the SRE-like sequence located in viral RNA.

A single clone that exhibits a high sensitivity to HBV (strain ayw, D type) infection was named HepG2-2B1 and was used in our experiments. It is well known that hundreds of ISGs are induced in response to IFN stimulation, but the degree of ISG upregulation varies among different cell lines. 24 We compiled a list of 285 ISGs that were reported to be significantly induced in several cell lines and constructed lentiviral vectors to express each of them in the HepG2-2B1 cells before HBV challenge. 25 The culture medium for each ISG-expressing HepG2-2B1 cell line was changed, the cells were collected 15 days post HBV infection (dpi) and the HBV level was determined by measuring the HBeAg level (Fig. 1a) . Figure 1b shows the relative level of HBeAg in the 15 dpi culture medium of the cells expressing different ISGs. Most ISGs had no or little effect on the propagation of HBV, as the level of HBeAg in the medium of these ISG-expressing cells was comparable with that of the control. Interestingly, several ISGs, including SAMD4A, Indoleamine-pyrrole 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO1), PML, ZAP, ISG20, MYD88, DDX3, and ZBP1, suppressed HBeAg production, suggesting that these ISGs are anti-HBV ISGs. Most of these proteins had been reported to have antiviral functions. ZBP1, also called DAI, is well-established as a cytoplasmic z-DNA sensor that can activate and amplify IFN signaling. [26] [27] [28] PML functions directly on multiple kinds of virus proteins to limit virus replication. [29] [30] [31] Moreover, some of these proteins are reported to directly inhibit HBV replication. The zinc finger protein ZAP recognizes the HBV terminal repeat region, degrades viral RNA and synergizes with multiple ISGs to mediate antivirus activity. 32 IDO1, a tryptophan degradation enzyme, inhibits HBV by tryptophan deprivation to efficiently reduce the intracellular DNA level of the virus. 33 HBV RNA reverse transcription. 36 The inhibitory effect of MKX on HBeAg is most likely due to the toxicity it induces in HepG2 cells (data not shown). Most noticeably, SAMD4A was the protein that exhibited the highest inhibitory activity (more than 95%) on HBV in our screen (Fig. 1b) , but its role in suppressing viral propagation has not been previously reported.",

Western blotting revealed that SAMD4A expression also decreased intracellular HBcAg levels ( Supplementary Fig. 1C ). Reduction in the three long HBV RNAs (3.5 kb, 2.4 kb, and 2.1 kb) were detected by northern blotting (Fig. 1e left) and the level of HBV RNA reduction was comparable to that of the HBV proteins. The signal emitted by the 0.7 kb viral RNA was too weak to be detected; therefore, we could not determine whether this RNA was influenced by SAMD4A. Southern blotting analysis showed that the amount of viral DNA was significantly decreased in the SAMD4A-expressing cells (Fig. 1e,  right) . Collectively, our data demonstrated that SAMD4A inhibits HBV propagation. Because of secondary infection by the newly synthesized virus, we were unable to determine the site(s) where SAMD4A exerts its inhibition at this stage.",

It is known that HBV cannot infect HepG2 and Huh7 cells due to the low NTCP expression in these cell lines but can be produced if the virus replicon pTSMP-AD38 is transiently transfected into these cell lines. We found that SAMD4A overexpression reduced HBsAg and HBeAg in the HepG2 and Huh7 cells transfected with pTSMP-AD38 ( Fig. 1f and Supplementary Fig. 1D ). The HepAD38 cell line inductively expresses a tetracycline operator/CMV promoter-controlled HBV genome and is widely used to produce HBV particles. We overexpressed SAMD4A in this cell line and detected profoundly inhibited HBV production ( Supplementary Fig. 1E ). As virus replication in these cell models bypassed early events, including virus binding, invasion, nucleocapsid translocation, rcDNA release, and conversion into cccDNA, SAMD4A interfered with virus replication at the late stage of the viral life cycle. We next tested whether SAMD4A-mediated suppression occurs in other subtypes of HBV by transfecting the type A HBV and type C HBV replicons into SAMD4A-overexpressing HepG2 cells and found that both virus subtypes were inhibited by SAMD4A (Supplementary Fig. 1F ). To determine whether the suppressive effect of SAMD4A is restricted to HBV, we tested the effect of SAMD4A overexpression on HSV and VSV in HEK293 cells and found that SAMD4A overexpression had no influence on the replication of HSV or VSV (Supplementary Fig. 1G) .",

Overexpression of either SAMD4A or SAMD4B in double-KO HepG2-2B1 cells rescued the inhibition of HBV replication in these cells.

An alignment of the SAMD4A protein sequences from different species revealed that amino acids 392-529 of the human SAMD4A are conserved. A functional assay showed that the deletion of this C-terminal portion abolished the HBV replication suppressing of SAMD4A ( Fig. 3e and Supplementary Fig. 4C ). Thus, a conserved region in the C-terminus of SAMD4A is also required for the inhibition of HBV replication.",

The SRE sequence bound by the Drosophila SAMD4A homolog Smaug was defined as a nonspecific stem with a 4-or 5 nt loop containing the CNGG or CNGGN sequence. 39 We searched the sequence in the HBV genome and found two candidates located at 1195-1217 nt and 1296-1321 nt. The latter is known as a conserved HBV posttranscriptional regulatory element (HPRE), whereas there is no report on the 1195-1217 nt sequence (Fig. 4b) . The 1195-1217 nt sequence is also conserved throughout all 61 HBV variants, for which sequence information is available. We named these two stem-loop SRE-like1 (1195-1217 nt) and SRE-like2 (1296-1321 nt), and examined whether these two stem loops were the target sites of SAMD4A. Each of them was cloned into the 3\u2032-UTR of GFP, as Drosophila Smaug-binding SRE is in the 3\u2032-UTR of mRNA ( Supplementary Fig. 5B ). Coexpression of the GFP reporter with or without SAMD4A in HEK293T cells revealed that neither stem-loop insertions influenced GFP expression, but SAMD4A coexpression led to decreased GFP expression in the cells with the plasmid containing SRE-like1 but not the plasmid containing SRE-like2 ( Fig. 4c and Supplementary Fig. 5C ). The guanine at the third position in the loop was reported to bind directly to Smaug and a hydrogen bond may form between cytosine 1 and guanine 4 to maintain the structure of the stem loop. 12 We mutated both cytosine 1 and guanine 3 and found that the mutant stem-loop could not be suppressed by SAMD4A, as indicated by the measured GFP fluorescence intensity (Fig. 4d and Supplementary Fig. 5D ). We generated an HBV replicon mutant by mutating cytosine 1 and guanine 4 in SRE-like1 and cotransfecting the expression plasmid with 3\u00d7 Flag-SAMD4A and the mutant HBV replicon into HepG2 cells.

Viral RNA with a mutated SRE-like1 was not pulled down by SAMD4A (Fig. 4e ) and the replication of the mutant virus was not suppressed by SAMD4A overexpression (Fig. 4f) .

SAMD4A coexpression reduced the levels of the 3.5, 2.4, and 2.1 kb but not 0.7 kb viral RNA (Fig. 5a ). It appears that SAMD4A selectively reduced the levels of the mRNA containing the SRE, regardless of whether the SRE was in the 3\u2032-UTR of the HBe, HBc, and HBs mRNA (3.5, 2.4, and 2.1 kb, respectively) or in the coding regions in the HBV P protein mRNA (3.5 kb). An SRE in the 3\u2032-UTR of the mRNA reduces gene expression. The aforementioned data suggest that the SRE might also reduce gene expression when it is in the coding region. To determine whether SRE can influence gene expression when it is in the 5\u2032-UTR or coding region, we used the GFP reporter system. We inserted an SRE into the 5\u2032-UTR or coding region of GFP and tested whether overexpression of SAMD4A affected the GFP expression ( Supplementary Fig. 5B ). As shown in Fig. 5b , c and Supplementary Fig. 5E , F, SAMD4A suppressed the expression of the GFP with the SRE in the coding region but had no effect on the GFP reporter with SRE in its 5\u2032-UTR. Mutated SRE in the coding region also eliminated the SAMD4A-mediated suppression of GFP (Fig. 5c) . Thus, viral proteins with SRE in the 3\u2032-UTR or coding region of its mRNA could be suppressed by SAMD4A. To determine whether SAMD4A affects the transcription of HBV, we performed a ChIP assay using an anti-RNA polymerase II antibody. Comparable amounts of HBV DNA were pulled down from the HepG2 cells cotransfected with the HBV replicon and plasmid expressing SAMD4A or SAMD4A A280H, a SAMD4A mutant that lost its function (Fig. 5d) . Thus, SAMD4A does not affect HBV transcription.",

As SAMD4A did not affect the transcription of the HBV mRNA, mRNA instability may be the cause of the reduction in HBV mRNA induced by SAMD4A.

Knocking down either 4E-T or CNOT6 negligibly reduced the antiviral ability of SAMD4A ( Supplementary  Fig. 6D ). We also generated 4E-T-KO and CNOT6-KO HepG2-2B1 cells, and measured the anti-HBV capacity of SAMD4A in these cells. Consistent with the knockdown results, deletion of either 4E-T or CNOT6 only partially suppressed the SAMD4A-mediated inhibition of HBV (Fig. 6b) . We also generated double KOs of 4E-T and CNOT6, and found no additive effect of the deletion of these two genes (Fig. 6b) . These data suggest that the functions of 4E-T and CNOT6 complexes are coupled in SAMD4A-mediated HBV suppression. Because of the limited effect caused by deleting the 4E-T and CNOT6 genes, other unknown mechanism(s) may play major roles in SAMD4A-mediated suppression of HBV. SAMD4A and different HBV mRNAs driven by the CMV promoter vector were coexpressed in HepG2 cells. RNA was extracted two days after transfection, and the HBV RNA level was measured by qPCR using HBV total RNA primers. b, c SRE-like1 or its C1A&G3C mutant was inserted in the 5\u2032-UTR (b) or coding sequence (next to the 172nd aa) (c) in GFP. SAMD4A was coexpressed with each of these reporters in HEK293T cells and GFP fluorescence intensity was measured 36 h after transfection. d Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) in digested chromatin from different HepG2 cells, in which nothing (vector), SAMD4A or SAMD4A A280H was overexpressed, was performed by anti-RNA polymerase antibody or control IgG. Purified DNA was analyzed by qPCR using primers targeting HBV DNA. The results are expressed as the ratio of the experimental group to IgG. e HepG2-2B1 cells were infected with lentivirus encoding nothing (vector), SAMD4A or SAMD4A A280H 5 days post infection with HBV. Actinomycin D (5 \u03bcg/mL) was added 24 h after transfection, and the RNA was extracted at the indicated time points. HBV RNA was measured by qPCR using HBV total RNA primers. f A total of 5 \u03bcg/mL actinomycin D was added to the WT and SAMD4A-KO HepG2-2B1 cells 5 days post-infection with HBV, and RNA was extracted at the indicated time points. HBV RNA was measured by qPCR using HBV total RNA primers. Data are presented as the means \u00b1 SD of triplicate samples, with similar results obtained in three independent experiments. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, and NS P > 0.05 SAMD4 family members suppress HBV replication in vivo As mouse hepatocytes cannot support productive HBV infection even when human NTCP is engineered to be expressed in them, there is no ideal mouse model for studying HBV infection. However, the effect of SAMD4A on HBV replication can be evaluated in mice by hydrodynamically injecting pTSMP-AD38 and SAMD4A-or SAMD4B-expressing plasmids into mice, which enables HBV production in mouse liver in the presence or absence of SAMD4A or SAMD4B overexpression. 43, 44 Serum and liver tissues were harvested and detected for viral antigens 3 days postinjection. The expression of SAMD4A or SAMD4B significantly reduced the levels of HBsAg and HBeAg secreted into the serum and the intrahepatic viral RNA level ( Fig. 7a and Supplementary Fig. 7A-C) . In addition immunohistochemical assays of the liver tissue revealed higher numbers of anti-HBcAg-and anti-HBsAg-stained cells in the control group than in the SAMD4A-overexpressing group (Fig. 7b) . Moreover, mouse SAMD4, the homolog SAMD4A in mice, exhibited suppression of HBV replication similar to that in the cells in vitro ( Supplementary Fig. 7D ).",

In this study, we screened and identified SAMD4A as the strongest antiviral ISG from nearly three hundred ISGs identified (Fig. 1a, b) . SAMD4A and its homolog SAMD4B inhibit HBV by promoting HBV RNA degradation. SAMD4A and SAMD4B suppresses HBV replication in vitro and in mouse models, and their expression levels were negatively correlated with the HBV titers in hepatitis B patient samples. SAMD4A suppresses all subtypes of HBV but not HSV or VSV. A deep literature search revealed that SAMD4A was identified in a screen of anti-Togaviridae virus factors, indicating that the viral suppression function of SAMD4A is not limited to HBV. 25, 46 It is Fig. 7 SAMD4A inhibits HBV production in the mice models. a, b SAMD4A-or SAMD4B-expressing plasmids (30 \u03bcg/mouse) and pTSMP-AD38 (15 \u03bcg/mouse) were coadministered in 8-week-old C57BL/6 J male mice by tail vein hydrodynamic injection.

The SRE sequence is conserved in HBV, suggesting that it may be essential for the viral life cycle. Several stem loops, such as the \u03b5 region and HPRE, were previously reported to be contained in HBV RNA, where it controls encapsidation and viral RNA nuclear export. 47 Other anti-HBV factors, such as ISG20, 34 RIG-I, 48 DDX3, 36 and MYD88, 35 inhibit virus replication by targeting \u03b5 or HPRE. However, the antiviral ability of these factors may interfere with each other because all of them target \u03b5 or HPRE. The SRE loop in HBV RNA was revealed in this study and is the unique site targeted by SAMD4A. We showed that SAMD4A can recognize and degrade RNA containing the SRE motif in the 3\u2032-UTR or coding sequence but not in the 5\u2032-UTR, which is an important piece of information for the future identification of other SAMD4A-regulated RNAs.",

Since the contribution of the 4E-T and CCR4-NOT complexes in SAMD4A-mediated HBV suppression is limited, the major mechanism(s) by which SAMD4A suppresses gene expression awaits further investigation.",

Overexpression of SAMD4A in the HBV-producing transgenic mice also inhibited HBV propagation. The negative correlation of SAMD4A and SAMD4B levels and HBV titers in human hepatitis patients supports the physiological relevance of SAMD4A/Bmediated suppression of HBV (Fig. 7f) . Therefore, future SAMD4A/B agonist screening may provide valuable information for therapeutic inventions of hepatitis B.",
