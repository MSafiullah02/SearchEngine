As reported by studies on natural disasters, war crisis, and other epidemic emergencies [26, 28] , these situations are associated with high levels of anxiety and distress, which represent some of the precursors of the PTSD onset. In our sample, these results have been confirmed. Sleep quality, generalized anxiety, and psychological distress were associated with PTSD symptomatology. Our findings confirmed the results of previous studies on the priority role of disturbed sleep in contributing to the development of PTSD symptoms [29] . Moreover, we confirmed the results of preceding studies on the Chinese population who reported high concomitance of sleep disturbance, psychological distress, and anxiety in the general population during the COVID-19 outbreak, with an increased risk of PTSD occurrence [20, 30] . Although further longitudinal studies are necessary, the present findings make us worry about the possible development of PTSD in the Italian population consequent to the COVID-19 emergency.",

Our results, as expected, indicated poor sleep quality, higher levels of generalized anxiety, and higher psychological distress in the Italian population involved in the COVID-19 emergency. Although these results should be considered with caution, given some characteristics of the samples considered, they further confirm the stressful impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the well-being of the Italian population. The uncertainty of the epidemic progression, together with the restrictive measures adopted by the Italian Government, is causing higher psychological pressure due to the fear that the epidemic is hard to control. In the first few weeks alone, the COVID-19 pandemic has already had dangerous effects on the Italian population. Our findings suggest that symptoms highlighted above can be a potent risk factor for the development of psychological diseases as previously reported for the Chinese population and accordingly with other studies on epidemic and quarantine conditions [3, [31] [32] [33] .",
