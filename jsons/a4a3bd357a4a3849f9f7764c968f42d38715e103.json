This gives them the ability to recognize foreign antigens by means of the major histocompatibility complex (MCH) molecules, known as T cell receptors (TCRs), which react with antigens on their surface. TCRs are not specific for any one antigen, though they have considerable diversity in immunocompetence. T cells provide what is known as cell-mediated immunity.",

A few, however, which do not take part in secreting antibodies, survive for up to several years. These are memory cells that can recognize the antigen responsible for their original formation if exposed to it once more. The same antibody is produced, but now at a faster rate, because in the meantime clonal expansion has resulted in the production of additional antigenreactive cells. This secondary immune response provides a highly efficient rapid response to antigen invasion, since it does not require the initial presence of large numbers of each specific leucocyte.",

These mediators are very important for regulating the function of other lymphocytes. Among these other cells are a number of different types of T cells that have special accessory molecules on their surfaces that allow them to perform a number of different functions. These cells include T-helper cells, which help B cells to make antibodies; T-suppressor cells, whose function is to suppress immune response and thus moderate it when necessary; and T-cytotoxic cells, which can destroy other cells that have been invaded by a virus. Another type of cell resulting from antigen reaction of T cells is the delayed-type hypersensitivity cell (Tdth, or THI), which can be involved in cell-mediated immune response, such as destruction of intracellular bacteria, autoimmune diseases, and rejection of tissue implants.",

Mast cells, which occur in large numbers in mucosal tissue, contain granules of pharmacologically active compounds. These have IgE antibodies on their surface and when, during an infection of the body, these bind to specific antigens, the cells are triggered to degranulate and release their contents. This causes local inflammation, which in turn calls neutrophils, monocytes, and lymphocytes to the site to oppose the infection. Basophils (basophilic polymorphonuclear leucocytes), which are related to neutrophils, contain similar granules and function in a similar manner to the mast cells. Eosinophils, also related to neutrophils, are particularly concerned with defense against parasites that are too large to be phagocytosed. They function by coating the parasite with IgG and IgE antibodies and destroy it outside the cell. These, and certain other cells with similar functions, are known as killer cells (K cells).",

A study of the development of the acquired immune system in chickens has shown that while deficiency of selenium on its own can impair bursal growth, stunting of the thymus occurs only when both selenium and vitamin E are inadequate (Marsh et al., 1986) . Thus, it appears that while deficiency of both vitamin E and selenium blocks the normal flow of inductive signals from epithelial cells to the developing lymphocytes, B cells are more vulnerable than T cells to selenium deficiency. The effect of selenium deficiency on antibody production appears to be age-dependent. When the mitogen sheep red blood cell (SRBC) was used to assess immune response in vitro, 2-week-old chicks maintained on a selenium-deficient diet had reduced antibody titres, whereas 3-week-old chicks only showed a reduction when they were both selenium-and vitamin E-deficient (Marsh et al., 1986) .",

The humoral system is also adversely affected, with decreased production of, for example, IgG and IgM titre in humans. Supplementation with selenium results in improvements in these processes. Mice given a low-selenium diet, with adequate vitamin E, had reduced IgG, but had normal IgM responses to SRBC mitogen.

However, it has been shown that supplementation at the supranutritional level may not be necessary to do this. Levels required appear to depend on species and antigen. In the case of lambs, for example, selenium at a level of 0.1 \u00b5g/g in the diet gave a better antibody response to parainfluenza-3 virus than did a dose of 1.0 \u00b5g/g in response to tetanus toxin (Larsen et al., 1988) .

Neutrophils from selenium-deficient mice, rats, and cattle, for instance, have been shown to be able to ingest pathogens in vitro, but are unable to kill them as efficiently as neutrophils from selenium-sufficient animals can (Boyne and Arthur, 1986) . Evidence from in vitro experiments that investigated production of superoxide by neutrophils from selenium-deficient mice stimulated with phorbal myristate acetate supports the view that the inability to destroy pathogens is related to decreased activity of GPX1 in the neutrophils.

In vitro studies that investigated the response of selenium-deficient mice to C. albicans found evidence that neutrophil candidacidal activity has a biphasic pattern (Boyne and Arthur, 1986) . When very low doses of selenium were given to deficient mice, candidacidal activity increased from approximately 9 to 14%. Additional supplementation did not increase this activity until much higher doses were given, which also correlated with changes in GPXI activity. These findings suggest that, in addition to GPX1, candidacidal activity of neutrophils is dependent on other selenium-dependent factors, including possibly phospholipid hydroperoxide GPX and cytosolic or mitochondrial TR.",

Selenium supplementation has the potential to prevent this occurring by reducing the production and concentration of these reactive oxygen species. It was reported by Peretz et al.

The group's interest in the relationship between infectious disease and host nutritional status began with their study of KD. They noted that, though KD was found only in regions of China with selenium-poor soils, many of the features of the endemic cardiomyopathy, such as its seasonal and annual incidence, and the fact that not all selenium-deficient individuals developed KD, could not be explained entirely on the basis of an inadequate intake of selenium. An infectious cofactor, possibly cocksackievirus, an enterovirus known to cause myocarditis, that had been isolated from the blood of KD victims was believed to be involved (Bai et al., 1979; Su et al., 1979) . Beck and her colleagues used a mouse model to investigate the relationship between cocksackie infection and myocarditis (Beck et al., 1994) . The mice were fed a diet deficient or adequate in selenium for 4 weeks and were then infected with either a benign strain of cocksackie B virus (CVB3/0), which was not known to cause cardiomyopathy, or with another strain (CVB3/20), which is myocarditic in mice. Both the selenium-deficient and the nondeficient mice injected with CVB3/20 developed myocarditis, as might have been expected, though symptoms were much more severe in the selenium-deficient than in the nondeficient animals, showing that the pathogenicity of the virus was increased by the deficiency. The results of infection with the benign strain CVB3/0 were unexpected. The selenium-adequate mice did not develop any myocarditis, as had been anticipated, while the selenium-deficient mice developed moderate myocarditis. Thus, the virulence of the normally benign virus was altered in the selenium-deficient animals-deficiency of selenium was seen to increase the pathogenicity of CVB3 virus, raising the severity of myocarditis caused by a virulent strain, and changing a normally benign strain into a virulent one (Beck, 1997) . The same effects occurred in vitamin E-deficient mice and in GPX-knockout mice, which suggests that oxidative stress was involved in the mechanisms that caused the mutations in the virus . It was also found that the change in virulence was due to specific mutations in the virus itself, such that once the mutation had occurred, even mice with normal nutrition became vulnerable to the virus (Beck et al., 1995) .",

The possibility that other viruses, such as poliovirus, hepatitis, influenza, or HIV, can also become more virulent by passing through a selenium-deficient host would have considerable public health implications. These, like coxsackievirus, are RNA viruses, and are prone to mutation in an oxidative environment (Beck, 1997) and in GPX-knockout mice (Beck et al., 1998) . This is because RNA viruses, unlike DNA viruses, do not have proofreading enzymes, and thus genomic mistakes that occur in them cannot be repaired during replication (Steinhauer et al., 1992) . It has been suggested that the emergence of new strains of influenza that has been reported in recent decades in China, a country with extensive regions of selenium-deficient soils, may be due to mutation of formerly less-virulent strains of the virus by passage through a low-selenium status population . Beck et al.

However, while such results appear to support the view that selenium supplementation could improve fertility in subfertile men, this has not always been found to be the case. A Scottish study of subfertile men did find that supplementation with 100 \u00b5g of selenium daily for 3 months resulted in significantly increased sperm motility and was followed by the fathering of a child in 11% of the group, compared to none in an unsupplemented control group (Scott et al., 1998) . In contrast, a Polish study in which subfertile men were given a supplement of 200 \u00b5g/day found that though there was an increase in selenium levels in seminal fluid, there was no increase in sperm fertility (Iwanier and Zachara, 1995) .",
