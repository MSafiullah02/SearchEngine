The current tests are mostly based on reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). It takes 4-6 hours to obtain results, which is a long time compared with the rapid spreading rate of COVID-19. Besides inefficiency, RT-PCR test kits are in huge shortage.",

Many of these preprints report patient cases of COVID-19 and some of them show CT scans in the reports. CT scans are associated with captions describing the clinical findings in the CTs. We used PyMuPDF 3 to extract the low-level structure information of the PDF files of preprints and located all the embedded figures. The quality (including resolution, size, etc.) of figures are well-preserved. From the structure information, we also identified the captions associated with figures. Given these extracted figures and captions, we first manually select all CT scans. Then for each CT scan, we read the associated caption to judge whether it is positive for COVID-19. If not able to judge from the caption, we located the text analyzing this figure in the preprint to make a decision. For any figure that contain multiple CT scans as sub-figures, we manually split it into individual CTs, as shown in Figure 1 . In the end, we obtain 275 CT scans labeled as being positive for COVID-19. These CT images have different sizes. The minimum, average, and maximum height are 153, 491, and 1853. The minimum, average, and maximum width are 124, 383, and 1485. These scans are from 143 patient cases. Figure 2 shows some examples of the COVID-19 CT scans.",

While our dataset is the largest publicly available CT dataset about COVID-19, it is still small. Training deep learning models on such a small dataset can easily lead to overfitting: the model would perform well on the training data, but generalizes badly on testing data. To address this problem, we adopt two approaches: transfer learning and data augmentation. Transfer learning aims to leverage a large collection of data from a relevant domain to help with the learning in the interested domain. Specifically, we use a large collection of chest X-ray images to pre-train a deep convolutional neural network, then fine-tune this pre-trained network on the COVID-CT dataset. Data augmentation aims to synthesize image-label pairs that are approximately correct, i.e., in most synthesized image-label pairs, the label is a correct annotation of the image.",

The hyperparameters are tuned on the validation set. The weight parameters in the networks were optimized using Adam (Kingma and Ba, 2014) with a learning rate of 0.0001 with cosine scheduling and a mini-batch size of 4. We evaluate our method using five metrics: (1) Accuracy; (2) Precision; (3) Recall; (4) F1 score; (5) Area under ROC curve (AUC). For all metrics, the higher the better.
