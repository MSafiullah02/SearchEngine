SaVs are mainly associated with sporadic acute gastroenteritis in young children (Hansman et al., 2007a; Khamrin et al., 2007; Monica et al., 2007) and are less commonly involved than NoV in epidemic gastroenteritis (Green, 2007), although some outbreaks have been described (Johansson et al., 2005; Hansman et al., 2007b, c). The burden of calicivirus (including NoV) has been clearly documented in numerous geographical areas worldwide (Hall et al., 2005; EFSA, 2009; Scallan et al., 2011).",

They are both classified within the family of the Caliciviridae, as the genera Norovirus and Sapovirus, each subdivided into five genogroups (Karst et al., 2003) and several serotypes. Three genogroups (GI, GII and GIV) containing more than 20 genotypes of NoV are known to infect human beings, and the intra\u2010genotype nucleotide diversity can be as high as 15% (Zheng et al., 2006). Most human infections are caused by GI and GII, whereas GIII affects swine. In the case of SaV, at least four distinct genogroups containing a number of genotypes and variants can infect humans (Farkas et al., 2004). Thus, NoV and SaV detection can be difficult owing to the large number of genogroups and genotypes; furthermore, currently available detection methods are not sufficiently powerful, and indeed, the prevalence of uncommon NoV variants is probably underestimated (La Rosa et al., 2008).",

Additionally, shellfish grown and harvested in wastewater\u2010polluted water can concentrate NoV, which may be inadequately eliminated by standard depuration procedures (Muniain\u2010Mujika et al., 2002): the consequence is outbreaks of gastroenteritis after consumption of shellfish (Le Guyader et al., 2006a; Le Guyader et al., 2008; Webby et al., 2007).",

Approximately 1.4 million people worldwide become infected with HAV annually (Issa & Mourad, 2001). The incidence of infection varies between regions of the world, with the highest rate in developing countries where sewage treatment and hygiene practices can be poor. Conversely, the number of reported cases of HAV infection has declined substantially in countries with effective programmes of immunization with a licensed vaccine. For example, in the USA, the number of cases has been reduced by 92% to an infection rate as low as one case per 100 000 persons per year (Daniels et al., 2009); similar situations now also apply to other countries including Canada, Australia, Japan and New Zealand (Jacobsen & Koopman, 2004).",

In an epidemiological investigation, 6.5% of acute cases of hepatitis A were identified as food\u2010 or water\u2010borne; however, this figure is probably an underestimate, because a considerable proportion of cases (~68%) remain uncharacterized (Daniels et al., 2009).",

Fifty\u2010one serotypes of human AdV (hAdV) in six subgroups (A\u2010F) have been described (Wold & Horwitz, 2007). hAdV serotypes 40/41, included in Group F, are the major causes of gastroenteritis in young children and are readily spread by the faecal\u2013oral route. They are sensitive to chemical disinfection but are more resistant to the effects of UV light than other enteric viruses (Thurston\u2010Enriquez et al., 2003). hAdV is shed from the gut on a long\u2010term basis regardless of the site of initial infection, although the mechanism has not been fully clarified in humans (Calcedo et al., 2009; Echavarria, 2009; Roy et al., 2009).

The wide range of diseases includes classical poliomyelitis, aseptic meningitis, cardiac disease, hand, foot\u2010and\u2010mouth disease, conjunctivitis and rashes. A common clinical picture is self\u2010limiting fever, malaise, muscle aches and headache; diarrhoea and vomiting are present only as a part of more generalized systemic illness. Clinical illness in temperate climates is more common in the summer months; all age groups are affected, and immunity to one serotype does not protect against infection with other serotypes (Moore et al., 1984). The serotypes of echoviruses and coxsackieviruses then circulate and dominate within communities change over time, and there is molecular drift within serotypes (Savolainen et al., 2001). hEVs can be found in all aquatic matrices reflecting their widespread occurrence in populations (Sellwood et al., 1981; Hovi et al., 1996; Sedmark et al., 2003). However, transmission of hEV infection through an aquatic route has been difficult to confirm as the number of asymptomatic infections is so large and the transmission by close personal contact so common.",

By contrast, for genotypes 3 and 4, only isolated cases of human infection have been described and only in more industrialized countries including the USA, Japan, China and countries in Europe. Although four genotypes of HEV exist, there only seems to be one serotype present (Zhou et al., 2003; Herremans et al., 2007; Mushahwar, 2008). Previously, HEV infections in industrialized countries were believed to be travel related, but recently an increasing number of indigenous HEV cases have been reported (Zanetti et al., 1999; Widdowson et al., 2003; Mansuy et al., 2004; Lu et al., 2006; Borgen et al., 2008). Serological studies have reported the presence of HEV antibodies in a variety of animal species, notably cows, cats, dogs and rodents. However, HEV RNA has not been detected in these species, and the validity of the assays used is seldom well established owing to the lack of positive reference samples: consequently, these results must be interpreted with caution (Bouwknegt et al., 2007). The presence of HEV has been reported in food, water and animals including pigs (Rutjes et al., 2009a). In several animal species, HEV genotype 3 and 4 sequences have been detected, with pigs being the animal most frequently involved in countries formerly designated as nonendemic for HEV. HEV RNA has also been detected in wild boar in several countries (Takahashi et al., 2004; de Deus et al., 2008; Martelli et al., 2008; Adlhoch et al., 2009), in Sika deer (Tei et al., 2003), in roe deer (Reuter et al., 2009), in red deer (Rutjes et al., 2010) and in mongoose (Nakamura et al., 2006). Furthermore, a human HEV genotype 1 strain was detected in workhorses in Egypt (Saad et al., 2007).",

They are classified in the Reoviridae family, and there are five major groups (A\u2010E) (Estes & Kapikian, 2007). Group A RV (GARV) is associated with a large majority of human RV infections and represents the major cause of child mortality because of diarrhoea worldwide (Parashar et al., 2006; S\u00e1nchez\u2010Padilla et al., 2009). GARV is also widespread in wild and domestic animal species, and it has been suggested that zoonotic transmission plays a substantial role in the introduction of novel strains into the human population (Cook et al., 2004; B\u00e1nyai et al., 2009). Within GARV, at least 19 G\u2010 and 27 P\u2010types can be distinguished on the basis of sequence diversity of the genes encoding the two outer capsid proteins (VP7 and VP4) (Matthijnssens et al., 2008; Van Doorn et al., 2009). The recent introduction of vaccines for human use may lead to the emergence of novel RV genotypes or the re\u2010emergence of older strains, particularly from animal reservoirs, and such strains could displace those currently predominating (Cook et al., 2004; Iturriza\u2010G\u00f3mara et al., 2004; Kang et al., 2005; Steyer et al., 2008).",

The other most frequent cause of virus\u2010contaminated foods is contact with faecal\u2010polluted waters (Fig. 1). Inadequately treated drinking water, consumption of crops contaminated after being irrigated with wastewater or fertilized with sewage and ingestion of shellfish grown in polluted waters are, therefore, common causes of food\u2010borne viral infection of people (Bosch, 1998). Several factors affect the contamination of shellfish, vegetables, berries, fruits and herbs. Climatic variables such as season, tidal cycles, rainfall and flooding have all been implicated in viral contamination of the environment (Le Guyader et al., 2000; Griffin et al., 2003; Suffredini et al., 2008; Guillois\u2010B\u00e9cel et al., 2009). Likewise, good livestock, agriculture and manufacturing practices are absolutely necessary to minimize the risk of viral contamination of food. Inappropriate irrigation practices, wastewater treatment and reuse, sewage overflows, and wastewater releases from polluted sources are the direct causes of viral environmental contamination and food\u2010borne outbreaks (Le Guyader et al., 2000; Griffin et al., 2003; Jim\u00e9nez\u2010Clavero et al., 2003; Choi et al., 2004; Suffredini et al., 2008; Guillois\u2010B\u00e9cel et al., 2009) (Fig. 1).

In recent years, outbreaks of food\u2010borne diseases associated with the consumption of animal products have received much attention, leading to consumer concern about the safety of the food supply. The health risk associated with animal operations depends on diverse factors. The most important is related to the animal species being reared and the concentration of pathogenic microorganisms in animal manure. Some viruses survive both for long periods and despite treatment, and their ability to remain infectious in the environment until ingested by a human or animal host is an added concern. However, it has been difficult to determine the role of livestock in most water\u2010borne virus outbreaks because both humans and various wildlife species can shed the same viruses and thereby serve as sources of infection or contamination. EVs are shed in faeces and, consequently, are disseminated through contaminated soil and water; therefore, any other animal species grazing in the same pastures and/or drinking from the same water sources as infected livestock are likely to be exposed. Consequently, they may be contaminated by the same or closely related virus variants and therefore present a high risk of further disseminating the virus (Ley et al., 2002; Jim\u00e9nez\u2010Clavero et al., 2005).",

There is a large spectrum of transmission modes for zoonotic viruses with domestic animal or wildlife reservoirs. They can be direct or indirect (Kruse et al., 2004) and include transmission by contaminated food, water, air and soil (Fig. 1). Meat can be contaminated by excreta during processing, but may also have been contaminated earlier because of infection of the living animal. The risk of food\u2010borne infection depends on the virus infection route, the level of contamination and the extent of inactivation during food processing. Livestock industries produce large amounts of residues that can cause substantial environmental problems. Indeed, accidental or deliberate spills, overuse of fertilizer and emissions of incorrectly, or incompletely, treated animal wastes are the major environmental risks (Jongbloed & Lenis, 1998; Jim\u00e9nez\u2010Clavero et al., 2005). Cook et al. (2004) estimated that contamination of arable land with animal RV in spread animal waste used as fertilizer may be considerable, and similarly substantial contamination is plausible or even likely for other viruses shed in large numbers in animal excreta. As expected, detection of animal viruses in contaminated waters (groundwater, lakes, rivers, estuaries, runoffs and animal watering tanks from farms, etc.) is much more frequent in areas of intensive than less active farming (Jim\u00e9nez\u2010Clavero et al., 2005).

However, the difficulties associated with evidencing cases and relating them to possible exposure make it very complex to assess the risk of infection. Health care facilities are the most extensively studied occupational settings. In such facilities, blood\u2010borne viruses, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus, can be transmitted mainly by accidents with infected needles or sharp objects (Davanzo et al., 2008). Air\u2010borne viruses such as the influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, AdV, rhinovirus, coronavirus, measles, rubella, mumps viruses and parvovirus B19 are also easily spread (Aitken & Jeffries, 2001). Viral agents transmitted via the faecal\u2013oral route, such as RV, hAdV 40 and 41 and NoV, are frequently associated with nosocomial and health care\u2013related infections spread by contamination of air, hands and surfaces (Lopman et al., 2004). Workers involved in sewage treatment and reuse for agricultural and industrial purposes can be exposed to enteric viruses. Seroepidemiological surveys show that workers in wastewater treatment plants (Clark et al., 1985; Heng et al., 1994; De Serres & Laliberte, 1997; Weldon et al., 2000; Divizia et al., 2008) and in spray irrigation activities (Katzenelson et al., 1976; WHO, 2006) are at higher risk than the general population, in terms of enteric and hepatic infections. Veterinary and zootechnical jobs can also expose workers to zoonotic viruses through contact with manure and inhalation of aerosols generated by activities such as washing and cleaning (Cook et al., 2004). Serological studies indicate that workers in the intensive animal husbandry sector may be exposed to zoonotic viruses, notably H1 swine influenza virus (Olsen et al., 2002). Workers in these fields of activity may therefore possibly have a role in species\u2010jumping from animal to human populations (Baker & Gray, 2009).",

However, the reduction values required for discharges from urban wastewater treatment plants are evaluated according to chemical and biochemical parameters, including biochemical oxygen demand, chemical oxygen demand, total suspended solids and total phosphorus and nitrogen; they do not address highly stable pathogens, like viruses.

There is good evidence that inactivation of viruses in the environment is less effective if they are absorbed onto or embedded within suspended solid matter that is not dried out.

This is largely owing to the difficulties in identifying this transmission route for single cases or outbreaks. The air\u2010borne transmission of viruses is dependent on the likelihood of material containing viruses to form aerosols and on the survival of viruses in the air. Enteric viruses can be aerosolized by, for example, violent vomiting (as associated with NoV) (Marks et al., 2000), toilet flushing (Barker & Jones, 2005), spray irrigation (Petterson et al., 2001) and various processes at wastewater treatment plants (Carducci et al., 1995). Some enteric viruses can cause infection by ocular contact or by inhalation and virus catchment by mucus and subsequent swallowing. Nevertheless, the most common mechanism of dissemination is the deposition of aerosol particles on surfaces, particularly food, vegetation and clothes. Surfaces such as door handles, banisters for staircases, flushing handles on toilets, toys, telephones, drinking cups and fabrics have all been implicated in the transmission of enteric viruses (Barker & Jones, 2005; Gallimore et al., 2008). Faecal material or vomit may contaminate these surfaces, and the viruses contained may then be ingested following direct contact or transfer from hands (Boone & Gerba, 2007). The characteristics of the material and the virus contribute to determining the survival rate (Abad et al., 1994; Vasickova et al., 2010). The detection of virus on a large variety of surfaces, like tables, door knobs, walls, toilets seats, thermometers, toys, cotton cloth, carpets, bed covers, gloves, drinking glasses, paper (Boone & Gerba, 2007) has helped to explain the routes of transmission of NoV (Wu et al., 2005; Boxman et al., 2009a), RV (Ansari et al., 1988) and rhinovirus (Ansari et al., 1991) in localized cases and outbreaks.",

The viruses most frequently involved in food\u2010borne infections are NoV and HAV, but other viruses, particularly human RV, hEV, HEV and AstV, are also transmitted by food. For NoV and HAV, person\u2010to\u2010person spread is the most common transmission route. Secondary spread of these viruses after introduction by, for example, food\u2010borne contamination is common and often results in larger, prolonged outbreaks (WHO and FAO, 2008). Estimates of the proportion of viral illnesses attributed to food are in the range of around 5% for HAV to 12\u201347% for NoV. However, all currently available estimates of food\u2010borne illnesses make assumptions and use extrapolations from different data sources (Scallan et al., 2011). Nevertheless, all essentially conclude that viruses are an important cause of food\u2010borne illness (WHO and FAO, 2008; Scallan et al., 2011). The incidence of outbreaks of food\u2010borne viral disease has increased considerably during the last decades, possibly due to the rapid globalization of the food market, the increase in personal travel and food transportation, and the profound changes in food consumption habits (Rodr\u00edguez\u2010L\u00e1zaro et al., 2009).",

Furthermore, contamination may arise by inappropriate practices during processing or at the point of sale/consumption (Boxman et al., 2009b).

In addition, shellfish, fresh produce or ready\u2010to\u2010eat foods may be contaminated with human excreta, either directly or indirectly, and viral food\u2010borne outbreaks may also originate from zoonotic viruses intrinsically present in food consumed.

Fresh produce has high water content \u2013 absorbed from groundwater during growth \u2013 and may be eaten raw and without peeling, both procedures that may remove external contamination.

Conversely, components like acids and various components of fruit juices may enhance the rate of viral inactivation (Kova\u010d et al., 2010).",

The ability to identify quickly the causative viral pathogen of an emerging viral epidemic markedly increases the chances of success of any countermeasures for containment, prevention and control of the possible disease. Surveillance of environmental viruses can underpin the detection of both cases and outbreaks by identifying an increase in frequency of disease above its background incidence (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2001) and by estimating disease impact. In addition, surveillance can help generate hypotheses and stimulate research, evaluating prevention and control measures and facilitating planning.",

Consequently, a sample or subsamples must represent the original matrix (e.g. water and food), and the sampling process (including the storage and transportation) must not alter the condition of the sample and thus not affect the subsequent analysis (Food Standard Agency, 2004a, b). Other aspects that also must be considered when developing a sampling programme are the characteristics of the matrix to be analysed (nature: solid, semi\u2010solid, viscous or liquid; type: food, water or environmental sample; composition: rich in fat, protein or plant contents such as tannins; and amount: scarce or abundant), and the subsequent analytical method to be used (cell culture, immunological or molecular). If, for example, a sampling plan for a p\u00e2t\u00e9 factory is required, a balanced approach needs to be based on the observation that a sample suitable for public health (for example 25 g of a p\u00e2t\u00e9) might not be suitable for subsequent analysis using a molecular method because of the heterogeneous nature and composition of the matrix.

For example, ISO has established a series of standards for sampling (ISO 5667 series, ISO 18593:2004; ISO 8066:2004; ISO 24276:2006; ISO 7002:1986; ISO 17604:2003); however, there is no specific mention of sampling for human enteric pathogenic viruses in any of these standards.

            "text": "A large number of studies are related to viral food\u2010 and water\u2010borne outbreaks, sporadic cases or studies using samples collected to determine the presence of different enteric viruses in food or the environment or to evaluate new methods for the detection of viruses in diverse matrices (Supporting Information, Tables S1 and S2). Several important lessons can be learnt from these studies. First, there is an evident lack of harmonization in the sample size, and therefore, a serious risk in the representativeness of the sampling strategies used. This is most important as most of those studies are related to viral diarrhoeal outbreaks: the consequences may include the true aetiological agent of the gastroenteritis not being found, or the infectious dose being under\u2010 or overestimated. In these studies, sizes of samples used were extremely diverse, ranging from 50 \u03bcL to 3000 L (i.e. an almost 108\u2010fold difference) for water and from 1.5\u2013200 g for food samples. Second, there is a lack of homogeneity in the selection of the animal tissues or part of the sample tested once the sample is collected. This also can affect the detection of human pathogenic viruses. For example, different shellfish tissues can be tested for human enteric viruses (i.e. the whole shellfish, the mantle, the gills, the stomach or the digestive diverticula). However, it has been demonstrated that the efficiency of recovery can differ substantially between types of sample and even that the virus may not be detectable in some (Wang et al., 2008). In a study evaluating different tissues of naturally contaminated oysters to identify the most suitable for the detecting virus, the percentages of samples positive were different for the whole oyster (0.7%), mantle (2.2%), gills (14.7%), stomach (13.9%) and the digestive diverticula (13.2%), and the detection was not possible when the adductor muscles were tested (Wang et al., 2008). Another important factor is the ambiguous use of individual or pooled samples for foodstuffs, especially in the case of shellfish. This affects directly both the representativeness and analytical sensitivity of the final results. For example, de Roda Husman et al. (2007) observed that pooling digestive glands of several oysters never resulted in a positive signal, whereas RT\u2010PCR testing of the individual digestive glands of single oysters revealed the presence of virus RNA. This indicates that pooling can affect the final results negatively and even can produce false negative results owing to the simple mechanism of reducing the size of each individual sample used in the pool. This can be of great relevance to public health. Conversely, the use of individual samples can also affect the representativeness of the population studied. A balanced approach to difficult food matrices may therefore be to analyse a representative number of individual samples; however, this could greatly increase both the cost and the time required for the analyses and even may be unfeasible in the field. Two other important aspects also have to be considered: the period of time from the sampling to the start of the analysis in the laboratory and the conditions of storage of the sample during that period. These issues can be of particular importance if complex matrixes are analysed, as the stability of the virus may be compromised. However, they are usually not rigorously addressed during sampling, and most studies do not provide the relevant details. Even where this information is provided, the lack of uniformity is again evident. Samples are sometimes stored frozen (Loisy et al., 2000; Schvoerer et al., 2000, 2001; Donaldson et al., 2002), refrigerated at 4 \u00b0C (Pina et al., 2001; La Rosa et al., 2007), at room temperature (Beuret et al., 2002) or kept on ice (Noble & Fuhrman, 2001; Katayama et al., 2008).",

The sampling strategy must be unbiased, sufficient (i.e. it summarizes all relevant information about the parent population, which contained the sample, but ignoring any sample\u2010specific information), efficient (i.e. the more the statistical values for various samples cluster around the true value and the lower the sampling error, the greater the efficiency) and consistent (the larger the sample, the closer the statistic should be to its true value) (Jarman, 1984).",

On the other hand, the ISO method 19458 \u2018Water quality \u2013 Sampling for microbiological analysis\u2019 (ISO, 2006), although not specific for mammalian virus, states that viruses should be transported and stored for a period of 24\u201372 h, at a temperature of 5 \u00b1 3 \u00b0C. The guidelines \u2018Standard Methods for the examination of Water and Wastewater\u2019 (Eaton et al., 2005) states that samples cannot be held more than 2 h at temperatures of 25 \u00b0C or 48 h at 2\u201310 \u00b0C; samples have to be stored at \u221270 \u00b0C if not processed in this time frame.

Moc\u00e9 i Llivina (2004) tested the stability of EV at \u221270 \u00b0C and demonstrated that they could infect cells after 11 months of storage at this temperature when adsorbed to cellulose ester membranes. In conclusion, transport and storage should be performed as quickly as possible, at a controlled temperature (5 \u00b1 3 \u00b0C). In this temperature range, samples can be stored for up to 48 h.

Indeed, the WHO and USA recommendations for this organism is biosafety level (BSL) 2, the Spanish recommendation is generally BSL 3 but not with all BSL 3 precautions as there is no evidence of aerosol contamination, and the British recommendation is BSL 3. This should be borne in mind when sending a sample likely to contain a virus to another laboratory.

Protocols for the concentration of viruses in water samples are generally based on four steps (Croci et al., 2008): adsorption of viruses to a filter; elution of adsorbed viruses using a protein\u2010rich buffer; reconcentration of viruses by flocculation, precipitation or filtration, and extraction of viruses, for example with chloroform. In solid samples (including foodstuffs), sample processing often starts with a washing step (in the case of fresh produce) or a homogenization step (in the case of, for example, shellfish); the virus is concentrated after this first step (Rodr\u00edguez\u2010L\u00e1zaro et al., 2007; Croci et al., 2008). If appropriate, a minimal volume of a diluent can be added to favour dissociation of the virus from the solid matter but avoiding interference with subsequent virus concentration/extraction. For dispersion of the sample in the diluent, a suitable mixing technique is required. The following step is the removal of food solids from the extract by, for example, filtration or differential centrifugation. Concentration methods appropriate for a wide variety of matrices include adsorption elution, differential precipitation, ultracentrifugation and ultrafiltration (Rodr\u00edguez\u2010L\u00e1zaro et al., 2007).",

Molecular techniques, if used with the appropriate quality controls, could allow substantial progress in the control of viral contamination of environment and food. These quality controls must include at least one negative and one positive reaction control, one negative and one positive process control and an internal or external amplification control (Hoorfar et al., 2004; Costafreda et al., 2006; Rodr\u00edguez\u2010L\u00e1zaro et al., 2007; Pint\u00f3 & Bosch, 2008; D'Agostino et al., 2011; Diez\u2010Valcarce et al., 2011a, b; Mart\u00ednez\u2010Mart\u00ednez et al., 2011) (Table 1). Controls for the estimation of the efficiency of the concentration and/or extraction procedures are also very important. Several approaches have suggested the use of nonpathogenic virus surrogates, with similar structural characteristics and which are not present naturally in the samples to be tested. As examples, Mengo virus MC0 (Costafreda et al., 2006) and feline calicivirus and murine NoV\u20101 (Cannon et al., 2006) have been proposed as appropriate surrogates for HAV and human NoV, respectively.",

More studies are needed to evaluate the significance of positive results, because the differing sensitivities of diverse techniques, like infectivity assays if available, do not allow a definitive evaluation of the infectious capability of the viral genomes detected.

Therefore, the information required in risk assessment studies is the number of viral particles with infective capacity. Obviously, cell culture\u2013based methods are the soundest methodologies for the estimation of the number of infective particles. However, as indicated earlier, there are no available culture models for some of the most significant food and environmental virus hazards, notably human NoV, HEV and even wild\u2010type HAV. In these cases, only molecular methods are available, but although RTq\u2010PCR is a quantitative and sensitive tool, it cannot distinguish between infective and noninfective viruses (Richards, 1999). This limits its usefulness for public health purposes. The ratio between GE and infectious particles has been reported to increase with the time, is strongly dependent upon water and climatic conditions and virus type, and can vary from 70 : 1 to 50 000 : 1 for EV in natural surface water (Rutjes et al., 2005) and in artificial ground and surface waters (de Roda Husman et al., 2009). For example, wastewater can contain up to 1500 GE HAstV L\u22121 but do not show any infective capacity. To overcome this limitation, several different approaches based on (RT) PCR have been assessed (reviewed in Rodr\u00edguez et al., 2009; see Table 2 for examples). However, it is unclear whether any direct PCR method can satisfactorily assess viral infectivity.",

Application of QVRA has been rendered difficult by the lack of culturing systems and low environmental levels of viruses that present a possible public health risk but cannot be typed or quantified. Moreover, standardized methods for quantification of virus hazards in different environmental matrixes and dose\u2013response models for the main environmental virus hazards are not available. For reliable quantification of viruses in food and environmental matter, various factors need to be determined: the detection efficiency of the assay used, the controls appropriate for accurately measuring both the true concentration and the release of virus into the environment, and the contamination of the food (Pint\u00f3 & Bosch, 2008; Pint\u00f3 et al., 2009). This is of the utmost importance for unculturable viruses, such as HEV and human NoV, for which only molecular quantitative detection methods are available. The raw numbers of GE, which are the data generated by such methods, must be corrected for the efficiency of the concentration and nucleic acid extraction steps and the capacity of the enzyme involved in the amplification\u2010based detection. A formula for the estimation of exposure to viruses in food matrices has been proposed by Havelaar & Rutjes (2008).",

Viral dose\u2013response models are based on three basic biological assumptions: single hit, independent action and random distribution (FAO and WHO, 2006). Using these assumptions, three different models can be applied to environmental virus hazards (Haas, 1983; Teunis & Havelaar, 2000; Zwietering & Havelaar, 2006). For example, Pint\u00f3 et al. (2009) estimated the relationship between HAV numbers in frozen coquina shellfish involved in two hepatitis outbreaks and the risk for human health. However, for HAV, immunity needs to be taken into account. Similarly, for human NoV that only induces short\u2010lived immunity, risk assessment should also take into account the observation that a proportion of the population is resistant to infection with NoV genogroup GI (Hutson et al., 2002; Lindesmith et al., 2003; Rockx et al., 2005) or GII (Thorven et al., 2005; Larsson et al., 2006).",

Published risk assessments for environmental viruses mainly concern water\u2010borne or food\u2010borne exposure, but other routes may be considered as well. For food\u2010borne viruses, the EU research project \u2018Integrated monitoring and control of food\u2010borne viruses in European food supply chains\u2019 (KBBE 213178; VITAL; http://www.eurovital.org) has been launched to develop pro\u2010active integrated monitoring and risk management strategies for the control of viral contamination of food supply chains.
