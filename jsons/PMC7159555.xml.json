Little information is known on the role of viruses in chronic persistent asthma in the absence of an obvious exacerbation. Children with asthma may be more susceptible to effects of viruses, and frequent recurrent respiratory viral infections could drive an ongoing inflammatory response. The incidence of rhinovirus infections is similar in asthmatic and normal controls but the asthmatics experience more severe symptoms (5). It is possible that viruses may persist as low\u2010grade infections and potentiate inflammatory response in the airway of asthmatic children.",

This was observed for all viruses (rhinovirus, metapneumovirus, HSV and EBV) other than adenovirus suggesting that the viral detection is not because of contamination from upper airways. In a previous study of asthmatic and normal adult volunteers, viral shedding was still detectable in 54% of adult subjects 14 days after experimental inoculation with human rhinovirus\u201016 (27). However, the quantity of virus was low at this point, and cold symptoms were generally either gone or resolving. Another study showed that adenovirus was detected for 2 weeks in six (75%) of eight cases suggesting that this DNA virus can be latent (10, 12). In addition, the normal reference values for neutrophil counts (%) from controls in this study, without a detectable virus in BAL (median neutrophil 1.32%, 95th centile 8.4%, n = 27), are lower than previously reported (median neutrophil 3.2%, 95th centile 29.8%) (28). Concurrent asymptomatic viral infection may have artificially inflated our previously published range and this suggests that the presence of a virus in BAL should be taken into account when interpreting BAL neutrophil counts.",

While shedding into respiratory tract may be the explanation in these children, rather than acute infection, it is notable that in four of the five cases (where symptom data were available), parents recorded recent respiratory tract symptoms and in three of these samples, there was a significant BAL neutrophilia. We cannot exclude the possibility that these represented acute de novo infection but we believe it is more probable that a prior stress, such as an acute respiratory tract infection (in one sample there was EBV and adenovirus present), caused acute airways inflammation and subsequent HSV/EBV shedding. However, given the persisting neutrophilia, it is possible that HSV/EBV shedding in the respiratory tract is associated with an ongoing neutrophilic acute inflammatory response in the lower respiratory tract and could potentially lead to more protracted symptoms in some children.",

Notably, our data suggest that in some asthmatic children, viral infection is associated with an airway inflammatory response with no evidence of asthma exacerbation. This could be due to the children having relatively mild disease or being stable on anti\u2010inflammatory therapy at the time of the infection.
