More than 100 million died in the past from smallpox caused by the variola virus. Influenza killed about 50 million people during the 1918 pandemic. More than 60 million have been infected with HIV since the first cases of the epidemic were reported in 1981, and more than 20 million have died from AIDS. Although vaccines remain the most cost-effective way to prevent viral infections, in many cases (e.g., HIV) vaccines are not available and, in other cases, available vaccines have to be modified frequently to counteract virus escape (e.g., influenza). Prophylaxis and treatment in such cases are critically important to fight viruses.",

            "text": "A number of studies have shown the importance of neutralizing antibodies in recovery and protection from viral infections (1, 2). Sera from humans or animals containing antibodies have been widely used for prophylaxis and therapy of viral and bacterial diseases since the late 1800s (3\u20136). Serum therapy of most bacterial infections was abandoned in the 1940s after antibiotics became widely available (5). However, polyclonal antibody preparations have continued to be used for some toxin-mediated infectious diseases and venomous bites (3). Serum immu-noglobulin (Ig) has continued to be also used for viral diseases where there are few treatments available, although mostly for prophylaxis either prior to an anticipated exposure or following an exposure to an infectious agent (7\u20139). Antibody products licensed in the United States for prevention or treatment of viral diseases include human Ig for use against hepatitis A and measles; virus-specific polyclonal human Ig against cytomega-lovirus, hepatitis B, rabies, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), vaccinia, and varicella-zoster virus; and the humanized monoclonal antibody (mAb) Synagis (7). Polyclonal Ig has also been used with various success for diseases caused by other human viruses including parvovirus B19 (10\u201313), Lassa virus (14, 15), West Nile virus (16, 17), some enteroviruses (18, 19), herpes simplex virus (20), Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (21), Junin virus (22), SARS-CoV (23, 24), and HIV (25\u201330).",

The molecular mechanisms of therapeutic efficacy of such antibodies are easier to dissect, and they can be engineered to further improve their therapeutic properties. Recently, some mAbs have shown clinical success. The humanized mAb Synagis (palivizumab), which is still the only mAb against a viral disease approved for clinical use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, has been widely used for prevention of RSV infections in neonates and immune-compromised individuals, and very recently has been further improved (31). However, it is not effective for treatment of an already established infection; for example, there were no significant differences in the clinical outcomes between the placebo and the palivizumab groups for children hospitalized with RSV infection (32); in addition, resistance can develop relatively quickly: a recent study found F gene-resistant mutations in an animal model of the RSV infection (cotton rat) 12 weeks after infection including a completely resistant virus (33).",

Conformational changes follow, which enable enhanced exposure of a co-receptor (typically CCR5 or CXCR4) binding site and binding of the viral glycoprotein gp120 to the co-receptor. Subsequent conformational changes finally result in fusion of the viral and cell membranes. In some cases, CD4 is not required and the Env directly interacts with a co-receptor. Because the Env mediates HIV entry and is the only viral surface protein exposed to the surrounding environment, it is a major target for neutralizing antibodies and a potent immunogen (36). Env-specific antibodies are generated as early as a few weeks after productive infection or immunization. They do not typically neutralize current virus isolates but rather neutralize earlier isolates (41). Such antibodies are isolate-specific and lack broad neutralizing activity because the virus has evolved to hide conserved epi-topes and escape neutralization by a number of mechanisms. As a result, most of the antibodies generated in natural infection or immunization are non-neutralizing or neutralize few isolates. More than 100 mAbs have been reported as recognizing epitopes on gp120 and gp41, but only a small number exhibit neutralizing activity against primary isolates from different clades, denoted as broadly cross-reactive neutralizing hmAbs (bcnhmAbs).",

The neutralizing activity of the most potent and broadly neutralizing CD4i antibody, X5 (47), also increases in many cases with decreasing its size to scFv or Fab. One should note however, that for some isolates and in some assays including assays based on spreading infection in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), IgG1 X5 is more potent than Fab X5 likely due to an increase in avidity.

Because CD4i epitopes may be available for limited time after CD4 binding to gp120 and before their interaction with a co-receptor, CD4i antibodies with faster binding kinetics would bind efficiently and are likely to have better inhibitory activity against HIV-1.

            "text": "HIV has evolved a number of strategies to escape host immune surveillance, prominently by modifications of its Env. Thus, naturally occurring whole antibodies against its Env may have little chance of significantly affecting viral replication and disease progression, as also evidenced by the lack of sustained significant effect in the few clinical trials that have tested such antibodies. This is mostly due to the rapid generation of resistant mutants, which remains a fundamental problem not only for antibodies but also for other antiretroviral drugs. Antibodies against components of the entry machinery, engineered antibody fragments and their derivatives, and other antibody-based inhibitors that do not occur naturally and against which the virus has not developed defense mechanisms may be better able to control virus replication, although mechanisms of inhibitory escape such as generation of resistant mutants and difficult access could still be operating. The challenge is to fight these mechanisms and simultaneously ensure a relatively long half-life and biological effector functions. Several directions of research appear promising in this aspect. One direction involves engineering antibody with higher binding affinity to conserved epitopes and with smaller size than the currently known antibodies. Another uses the unique features of some anti-Env antibodies (e.g., the mimicry of receptors) to engineer novel binding entities with high-binding affinity to many isolates. A third consists of engineering novel fusion proteins containing antibody-binding fragments. A fourth relies on using antibody effector functions, including antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and complement, to increase the efficacy in vivo. Yet another direction of research aims to develop antibody-nanoparticle conjugates, or nanoliposomes in particular, that are able to irreversibly inactivate virus and cells expressing viral proteins. The development of novel approaches may also be fruitful in the future, as well as combining existing ones to develop antibody-based HIV inhibitors using other, yet undiscovered principles. Whether these or other research directions will lead to clinically useful antibody-based inhibitors of HIV infections remains unknown; however, even if new engineered antibodies fail to inhibit HIV infections in a clinically useful way, there is still a basis for optimism in this endeavor because the new approaches can prove useful elsewhere. Finally, one should note that all bcnhmAbs have undergone a long maturation process and differ from the germline sequences by tens of mutations. One could speculate that generation of such antibodies in vivo following immunization is very unlikely because of the lack of B cells expressing surface-associated Ig that is close in function to those bcnhmAbs. This may represent a challenge in developing effective AIDS vaccines, and further studies are required to find novel approaches for elicitation of bcnhmAbs in vivo.",

The selected seven Fabs, m101\u20137, inhibited, to various degrees, cell fusion mediated by the HeV or NiV Envs and virus infection. The conversion of the most potent neutralizer of infectious HeV, Fab m101, to IgG1 significantly increased its cell fusion inhibitory activity\u2014the IC50 was decreased more than 10-fold to approximately 1 \u03bcg/mL. The IgG1 m101 was also exceptionally potent in neutralizing infectious HeV; complete (100%) neutralization was achieved with 12.5 \u03bcg/mL and 98% neutralization required only 1.6 \u03bcg/mL. The inhibition of fusion and infection correlated with binding of the Fabs to full-length G as measured by immu-noprecipitation, and less with binding to sG as measured by ELISA and Biacore. M101 and m102 competed with the eph-rin-B2, which we and others recently identified as a functional receptor for both HeV and NiV (98, 99), indicating a possible mechanism of neutralization by these antibodies. The m101, m102, and m103 antibodies competed with each other suggesting that they bind to overlapping epitopes that are distinct from the epitopes of m106 and m107. In an initial attempt to localize the epitopes of m101 and m102, we measured their binding to a panel of 11 G alanine scanning mutants and identified two mutants, P185A and Q191,K192A, which significantly decreased binding to m101, and one, G183A, which decreased binding of m102 to G. These results suggest that m101\u20137 are specific for HeV or NiV or both, and exhibit various neutralizing activities; they are the first hmAbs identified against these viruses and could be used for treatment, prophylaxis, diagnosis, and as research reagents and aid in the development of vaccine.",

These antibodies specific for SARS-CoV, HeV, and NiV have potential for further development into a clinically useful product for prophylaxis and perhaps treatment of the diseases caused by these infections. They are very potent, and the viral infections to which they are specific are acute, such that only control or dampening of virus replication for a relatively short period of time (few weeks) is likely to be required after which the host immune system could control virus replication. In addition, these antibodies could be cross-reactive. Thus, the problem of neutralization resistant mutants able to evade their inhibitory activity and the immune response is not as significant as for chronic infections with a high level of virus replication, e.g. HIV infections. A note of caution is that careful examination of candidate antibody therapeutics is required because of the possibility for infection enhancing effects, as e.g., for Ebola, and animal model-dependent effects as well as in some cases, although rare, toxicity. A recent study also reported the possibility that neutralizing antibodies can enhance entry of SARS-CoV by a mechanism that involves antibody interactions with conformational epitopes in the S RBD (69). In addition, it is known that in some cases antibodies that do not neutralize in the assay currently used for evaluation of their in vitro activity could exhibit potent neutralizing activity in vivo; thus new approaches should be developed and antibodies tested also for their effector functions mediated by the Fc including antibody-dependent direct cytotoxicity and complement-mediated immune responses.
