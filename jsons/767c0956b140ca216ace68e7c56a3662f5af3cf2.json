Immunosenescence contributes to reduced efficacy to vaccination and increased susceptibility to infectious diseases in the elderly. Extensive studies of laboratory animal models of ageing or donor lymphocyte analysis have identified changes in immunity caused by the ageing process. Most of these studies have identified phenotypic and functional changes in innate and adaptive immunity. However, it is unclear which of these defects are critical for impaired immune defense against infection. This review describes the changes that occur in innate and adaptive immunity with ageing and some age-related viral diseases where defects in a key component of immunity contribute to the high mortality rate in mouse models of ageing.",

The global population is ageing and the proportion of elderly individuals aged 60 years and older is expected to reach 21% of the whole population by 2050 [1]. This presents a major challenge to public health services as the elderly are a vulnerable population to emerging infectious diseases, such as pandemic influenza (H5N1), West Nile virus (WNV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) [2\uf02d4] . Moreover, immunosenescence renders vaccination less effective in the elderly. For example, the yearly influenza vaccine is only 29%-46% efficacious in persons aged \uf0b375 years and 41%-58% in persons 60-74 years old [5] compared to 70%-90% in young adults [4] . Additionally, reduced immune responses have been observed in elderly individuals vaccinated against tetanus, hepatitis and Streptococcus pneumonia [2] . Thus, there is an urgent need to develop strategies for improving vaccination efficacy and therapies to strengthen immunity in the elderly. However, to achieve this goal, a thorough understanding of the mechanisms underlying the age-related decline in immunity is needed.",

These result in reduced T cell TCR diversity and function [8] [9] [10] . Another feature of the T cell compartment in ageing humans or mice is the accumulation of large oligoclonal expansions of CD8 + T cells that are often cytomegalovirus (CMV)-specific [11] [12] [13] . Through longitudinal studies, Pawelec et al. [14] found that CMV seropositivity has a direct relation to immune risk phenotype (IRP). The IRP is characterized by decreasing na\u00efve CD4 + cell numbers, an inverted ratio of CD4/CD8 cells and CD8 + T cell repertoire (TCR) disturbance [15] [16] [17] . About 60%-100% of the human population is persistently or latently infected with CMV, and chronic infection by CMV may accelerate ageing of the immune system and lead to a high levels of chronic subclinical inflammation [18] . CMVspecific CD8 + T cell expansion, resulting in a decrease of peripheral na\u00efve CD8 + T cells and TCR diversity contraction, causes weak responses to new infectious pathogens [15, 16] . Whether other viruses, such as Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), herpesviruses (human herpesvirus, HHV) or polyomaviruses (BK virus, JC virus) may also contribute to accelerated immunosenescence in the aged population is still not fully understood [19] [20] [21] .",

Functional and phenotypic analysis indicated that other factors probably influence the process of age-related immunosenescence.

Although the percentage and number of human B cell precursors in the bone marrow do not decline significantly during ageing [30] , the total level of mature human B cells in peripheral blood significantly decreases with age [31] [32] [33] . Like T cell compartments, antigenexperienced memory cells are most prevalent in the peripheral B cell pool, resulting in limited B cell clonal expansion and repertoire diversity limitation [34, 35] . Based on different antibody isotypes, human memory B cells can be subdivided into two distinct types: IgM memory (IgG \uf02d IgA \uf02d CD27 + ) and switch memory (IgG + IgA + ) B cells [36] . The absolute num-ber of IgM memory B cells significantly decreases as a result of the decline of total B cell numbers. However, the percentage remains unchanged. However, the percentage and number of switch memory B cells decreases during ageing [37] . Functional analysis studies have demonstrated that both IgM memory B cells and switch memory B cells are impaired in the elderly, which helps to explain why vaccines have poor effects against infections in aged people [31, 38] . Above all, antibodies secreted from B cells are also influenced by ageing. Johnson et al. [39] demonstrated that antibody affinity in aged individuals is lower than in young people, which also contributes to reduced protection from vaccination.",

NK cells are derived from bone marrow. In humans, NK cells comprise about 15% of all blood lymphocytes and are defined phenotypically by their expression of CD56 surface antigen and lack of expression of CD3 [43, 45] . According to the cell surface density of CD56 and CD16 expression (Fc\u03b3RIII), human NK cells can be divided into two distinct subsets, the majority (~90% in blood) of human NK cells are CD56 dim CD16 + , and a minor population (~10% in blood) is CD56 bright CD16 \uf02d [45] . Early functional studies revealed that CD56 bright cells have the ability to produce abundant cytokines and have a high cytotoxic function, whereas CD56 dim cells may function as efficient effectors of natural and antibody-dependent target cell lysis [46, 47] . However, when resting NK cells were activated with interleukin (IL)-2 or IL-12 in vitro, CD56 bright and CD56 dim cells exhibited similar levels of cytotoxic ability [48, 49] .",

Recent studies have begun to elucidate age-associated changes of NK cell receptors. Lutz et al. demonstrated that the expression of KIRs is increased in the elderly population and this phenomenon is also observed in T-cell related receptor expression [62\uf02d64]. In contrast, Almeida-Oliveira found no age-related changes in overall KIR expression on NK cells, but demonstrated an increase in KIR expression in the CD56 bright subset of elderly subjects instead [65] . Their results are similar to a previous report [66] .

Some limited studies have focused on the effect ageing has on the production of cytokines and the regulatory role of NK cells on adaptive immunity. Previous studies indicated that cytokines and chemokines produced by NK cells in rodents decreased with advancing age. It was observed that IL-2-induced IFN-\uf067 production and IL-2-or IL-12-induced production of chemokines such as macrophage inflammatory protein 1a (MIP-1a) and IL-8 were decreased in NK cells from aged individuals [68, 69] . Mocchegiani et al. [70] showed that NK cell production of IFN-\uf067, TNF-\uf061, IL-2 and IL-12 was decreased in elderly individuals and might contribute to T cell deficits associated with ageing. However, in a recent study, IFN-\uf067 production upon NK cell activation was shown to be significantly higher in the aged, particularly in subjects older than 85 years of age compared to younger adults [71] . Moreover, they found IFN-\uf067-expressing NK cells correlated positively with the serum content of the -SH groups in seniors. Their findings indicated that activation of NK cells at an advanced age might be related to the oxidative and inflammatory status of the elderly.",

At present, there is no standard criterion of senescence and it seems to vary with the development of the economy and subjects' physical quality. Some studies indicated that NK cell activity and cytotoxicity could be modulated by external agents such as zinc [70, 72] . Recently, \"inflamm-ageing\" has been described, where healthy ageing individuals have an active inflammatory state, with high levels of IL-6, IL-1\uf062 and tumor necrosis factor-\uf061 (TNF-\uf061) [73] . Whether the elevation of these cytokines can regulate NK cell activity remains unknown.

Aged mice infected with WNV had a high mortality rate due to uncontrolled virus spread to the brain because of CD8 and CD4 T-cell functional defects. T cell responses in aged mice following WNV infection were weak demonstrated by insufficient numbers of ineffective effector T cells accumulating in the brains of WNVinfected old mice. Both CD4 and CD8 T cells exhibited profound quantitative and qualitative defects, but these defects did not extend to all aspects of antigen recognition and activation. Furthermore, it seems that the ability of T cells to migrate into the mouse brain was not diminished, but that the infiltrating T cells had a diminished effector function [81] . Adoptive transfer of adult CD4 or CD8 T cells significantly protected aged mice against lethal WNV infection. Collectively, specific age-related defects in T cell immunity, affecting both CD8 and CD4 T cells, are the main reason for the increased susceptibility to WNV infection in the mouse model of ageing.",

Monkeypox is a serious endemic disease in central Africa and a recent outbreak occurred in the USA [82, 83] . Although all mouse strains can be infected with ECTV, the outcome of the infection following footpad inoculation varies. Some sensitive strains such as BALB/c develop mousepox and endure a very high mortality rate during the first two weeks post-infection (PI) [84, 85] , while other strains such as C57BL/6 (B6) control the infection without visible symptoms. The resistance of B6 mice to disease is not due to an inherent decreased ability of the virus to replicate in this strain but to the combined action of the innate and adaptive immune systems. Deficiencies in innate immune components caused by NK cell or macrophage depletion, or deficiencies in adaptive immune components such as in CD8 T cell knockout mice, B cell knockout mice or severely immunodeficient (recombinase activating gene 1 knockout mice) mice in resistant B6 background, all readily succumb to mousepox [86] [87] [88] [89] [90] .",

Surprisingly, the main reason for the loss of resistance is not because of intrinsically defective T cell responses. Instead, the primary reason is because of defects in NK cell responses in the aged mice. We observed a decrease in the number of total and mature NK cells in the blood of aged mice [92] . In addition, after ECTV infection, mature NK cells in aged mice have an intrinsic defect in migration to the D-LN to prevent systemic virus spread. In our previous work, we demonstrated that D-LN is a major site for the prevention of viral spread [93] . Furthermore, lymph nodes are an important site for the initiation of immune responses, and where NK cells interact with other immune cells such as DCs and T cells, to regulate adaptive immune functions [94] . Therefore, our results demonstrate that NK cells from aged mice have defects in their ability to migrate to the D-LN after ECTV infection, which results in increased early virus replication and spread as well as susceptibility to an acute viral disease.
