Our study results show that rabbits in Europe are infected with HEV and that some farmed rabbits and wild rabbits in France are infected. We found HEV RNA in 7% of the farmed rabbits and in 23% of the wild rabbits. However, the ages of the rabbits and the tissues tested (bile samples from farmed rabbits and liver samples from wild rabbits) may explain the observed difference in HEV prevalence. Nevertheless, previous studies have shown that the virus loads in liver and bile samples from swine infected with HEV are similar (29,30). Although the greater prevalence of HEV in wild rabbits could be linked to their older age, we could not test for a relationship between the prevalence of HEV and rabbit age because we did not know the rabbits\u2019 precise ages.",

Analysis of ORF2 showed that the sequences from rabbit HEV strains formed clusters, one of which included the sequences of HEV genotypes 2 and 4. The bootstrap values were very low because the fragments analyzed were small. In contrast, phylogenetic analyses based on ORF1 and the full-length genome indicated that all the rabbit strains from China and France belong to the same clade. One human strain, TLS-18516-human, clustered with the rabbit strains and appeared to be somewhat different from the 4 major HEV genotypes found in mammals and the newly described HEV genotypes from rats and wild boars. Although the full-length sequences of the genomes of the rabbit strains and the TLS-18516-human strain are more similar to that of HEV3 than to those of HEV1, HEV2, and HEV4, they do not seem to belong to the established HEV genotype 3 found in humans and swine, as recently suggested (20,32). Differences in the classification of rabbit HEV could be because the full-length genomic sequences were used as the reference for phylogenetic analyses. Genotype 3 is highly diverse, with 10 identified subtypes (27). We included in our analysis the full-length genomes of subtypes 3f, 3c, and 3e, which account for \u224874%, 13%, and 5% of the human and swine HEV strains circulating in France (26,33). We also included the other full-length genomes representative of HEV3 subtypes, but subtypes 3d, 3h, and 3i are not yet available in GenBank. Our data indicate that the genomes of rabbit HEV strains or TLS-18516-human were <80% identical with HEV3, regardless of which method was used to align the sequences. This finding is compatible with the definition of a new genotype, as previously proposed (21,22).",

The X domain corresponds to a macro domain found in the nonstructural polyproteins of several positive-stranded viruses such as togaviruses and coronaviruses (35\u201337). This domain can bind polyadenosine diphosphate\u2013ribose regions and could play a role in the replication or transcription of virus RNA. Whether the insertion in the X domain influences the function of the HEV macro domain warrants further investigation.

HEV is endemic to southwestern France, and the annual incidence of locally acquired HEV infections has been estimated as 3.2% (38,39). A case\u2013control study found that the only factor independently associated with HEV infection was the consumption of game meat, mostly wild boar, deer, and wild rabbit (23). However, molecular data from various studies in France indicate that most HEV strains identified belong to genotypes 3f, 3c, or 3e, which are prevalent in pigs and wild boars (23,26,40). A recent study showed the same proportions of genotypes 3f, 3c, and 3e in human and pig populations (33). Although this finding could indicate that rabbit HEV strains are less readily transmitted to humans than HEV genotype 3 strains, the primers used for PCR amplification were not specifically designed for rabbit HEV strains. Therefore, the true prevalence of HEV RNA among rabbits and humans may have been underestimated. In addition, genotyping rabbit HEV may have been difficult because reference sequences have become available only recently.",
