These researchers believe that no matter how complex this machine could be, the mystery of which shall be ultimately unveiled by investigating its every separate part. Evidently this is a philosophy of reduction. Accordingly, last century's life science is a typical experiment discipline adopting the strategy of \u201cdivide and conquer\u201d. However, along with the accomplishment of Human Genome Project and the advent of Post-Genome era, scientists gradually recognize that life is not an automata but a complex system following rules much different from reductionism (Kitano, 2002).",

Moreover, these bio-macromolecules never behave or perform their biological functions alone, but have many direct or indirect relations between each other, which could be in physical or chemical manner. It is these relations that bring about various biological networks, such as metabolic network, gene regulation network, and signal transduction network, etc. Ultimately, all activities of life fall back on these networks in their structure and function (Maslov and Sneppen, 2002).",

In those 100 experiments, the node with its degree equal to 34 appeared only once.

The reason of this difference may lie in that the surface area of living cells is finite and the type of terminals or membrane proteins is also limited. The reception, procession and emission of signals are frequently performed in the form of coding (Buck, 2000; Buck and Axel, 1991), not in simple linear form such like receptor A only receives signal a, then transmits to the next node B, till reaches the information processing center, where decisions are made. The practical situation is usually that a group of similar or identical receptors could receive and emit different signals, according to the different location, number and excitation time of activated receptors.

Besides the difference in evolution mechanism, another possible reason for this small exponent could be the general existence of decentralized decision-making in organisms, which dramatically decreases the quantity of hub proteins that have enormous neighbors. To explain this, we construct another 100 scale-free networks comprising 931 nodes and 6798 edges, following the same evolution mechanism defined in classical BA model. In these networks, the hub node with most neighbors has 106 links to other nodes. If we construct enough more scale-free networks of this kind, a star network would theoretically emerge, in which all terminal nodes link to the central hub to have its degree equal to 930.

By shrinking all nodes in the same community into one node, Fig. 6A is transformed to Fig. 6B.

One should first remove the research object from its environment, then separate it into parts and explain the whole with isolated parts. Notwithstanding this traditional technique has achieved successive triumphs on colony, individual, organ, cell and molecule level, lots of secrets lie in the emergence, which is the characteristic of the whole. These conspicuous new features derive from the interaction of many simple units that constitute a complex system, which cannot be predicted in advance. For instance, single molecule has no temperature or pressure. Only until lots of molecules assemble, temperature and pressure make sense. Reduction theory cannot interpret these phenomena because the emergence disappears once the wholeness is break.
