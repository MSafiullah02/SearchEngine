            "text": "Zoonotic diseases \u2013 diseases that pass from an animal to a human \u2013 have gained international attention in recent years (UNEP, 2020). In addition to the SARS-CoV-2 virus causing the global Covid-19 pandemic, still developing at the time of writing, some of the other diseases transferred from animals to humans over recent years include Ebola, avian influenza (\u2018bird flu\u2019), H1N1 flu (\u2018swine flu\u2019), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), Rift Valley fever, sudden acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), West Nile virus and the Zika virus. Many serious emerging zoonotic infections have originated from bats, including Ebola, Marburg, SARS-coronavirus, Hendra, Nipah, and a number of rabies and rabies-related viruses (Wood et al. 2012). Although these diseases exhibit a diversity of characteristics, including in their mode and rapidity of transmission, all have carried the threat of pandemics, with some of those threats having been realised in the form of many thousands of excess deaths1\nand economic losses in the billions of dollars. The majority of human infectious disease events that have emerged in recent decades have their origins in wildlife (Jones et al., 2008), with 65% of all human pathogens discovered since 1980 having been identified as zoonotic viruses (Woolhouse, 2002). Through a review of the literature available at the time, Taylor et al. (2001) identified 1,415 species of infectious organism known to be pathogenic to humans, 61% of these zoonotic. That analysis also concluded that 75% of emerging pathogens were zoonotic, with zoonotic pathogens twice as likely to be associated with emerging diseases than non-zoonotic pathogens. Pathogen transfer from wild species appears to be particularly prevalent, despite contact between humans and wildlife being rarer than with domestic animals. Kreuder Johnson et al. (2015) concluded that 86 of 95 zoonotic viruses (91%) were transmitted from wild animals, 24 of these potentially transmitted by both wild and domestic animals, and only 8 uniquely from domestic animals. This implies that 62 out of 95 (65%) are uniquely derived from wild animals. UNEP (2016) recognised a global increase in zoonotic epidemics, including 75% of emerging infectious human diseases, the origins of which were identified as closely linked with environmental changes and which were emerging at a rate of, on average, one new infectious human disease every four months. Khabbaz et al. (2015) recognised 25 emerging or re-emerging infectious disease threats linked to wildlife between 2000 and 2013.",

            "text": "According to these analyses, a key contributory factor in the increase in number and diversity of zoonotic diseases has been the extent to which humans are increasingly interacting with, and impacting upon, ecosystems, given the close relationships between human, animal and environmental health. For example, land use change has been estimated by the EcoHealth Alliance (2019) to be linked to 31% of outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases (EIDs), including HIV, Ebola, and Zika virus, which are considered connected to anthropogenic changes in tropical rainforests, with 15% of these EIDs linked to agricultural changes.2\nVirus transmission risk has been recognised as highest from animal species that have increased in abundance and/or expanded in range by adapting to human-dominated landscapes, with domesticated species, primates and bats identified as carrying the greatest risk of zoonotic virus transmission (Kreuder Johnson et al., 2020). In essence, the Anthropocene (Crutzen and Stoermer, 2000) has unwittingly created new propagation pathways by overriding or degrading those ecosystem services that might otherwise help to suppress disease propagation. Simultaneously, ecosystem degradation driven by intense human activities has undermined ecosystem services such as fresh water provision, essential for hygiene to prevent human-to-human transmission and for treating resultant infections. Intrusion into and conversion of habitats by humans promotes propagation pathways by degrading natural barriers in ecosystems, and by facilitating practices such as the bushmeat trade and \u2018wet markets\u20193\nthat increase the risk of animal-human contact in developing world settings.",

Conversely, regeneration of ecosystems constitutes investment in foundational natural capital providing greater human security and opportunity, as evidenced by fragmented ecosystem-based socio-ecological regeneration schemes around the world (Everard, 2020). Whilst some nature-based solutions may exacerbate disease risks if poorly planned, for example inappropriately sited and managed open water systems potentially promoting malaria in urban areas, both restored ecosystems and nature-based methods emulating natural functions can enhance disease regulation as part of a linked set of societally co-beneficial ecosystem services (Medlock and Vaux, 2015). By reinstating lost ecosystem processes, these nature and nature-based solutions may potentially rebuild barriers to disease organisms transferring from animals to humans. In addition, these forms of regeneration of ecosystem functions could, if combined with sustainable management of human activities and infrastructure, enhance benefits such as access to adequate supplies of clean water, which have significant roles to play in the management of disease outbreaks. The globally-coordinated UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration 2021-2030 (UN, 2019a) is an attempt to respond to the loss and degradation of habitats through programmes to rebuild and restore humanity\u2019s relationship with nature.",

The principal components comprise Drivers or driving forces (socioeconomic sectors that drive human activities), Pressures (human activities that stress the environment), resulting environmental and ecological State change (changing conditions of the natural and living phenomena), Impacts on services and values (effects of environmental degradation of ecological attributes and ecosystem services), and Responses to those impacts (policies and responses) (Bradley and Yee, 2015). The DPSIR framework has subsequently been used by other bodies, for example, adoption by the United Nations (UNEP, 2007) and the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) (Bradley and Yee, 2015), and applied to management problems in a diversity of agricultural, water resource, land and soil, biodiversity, marine, human health and other settings. There are now 25 derivative schemes and a widespread and increasing usage of the DPSIR-type conceptual framework as a means of structuring and analysing information in management and decision-making across ecosystems albeit subject to variations in interpretation mainly between natural and social scientists (Patr\u00edcio et al., 2016). The DPSIR framework is used here as a conceptual basis for analysing the human-environmental linkages entailed in facilitating zoonoses, including Covid-19, leading to recommendations for strategic responses to current and future threats.",

            "text": "Our starting point in this case is the identification of a set of pressures facilitating the emergence of infectious diseases, including zoonoses, which can be linked back to some over-arching primary drivers. Pressures increasing contact between wild animals, domestic animals and humans are of particular interest in this analysis. Pressures identified include deforestation and other land use changes, intensified agriculture and livestock production, illegal and poorly regulated wildlife consumption and trade, and land use changes for purposes other than agriculture (UNEP, 2020; Kreuder Johnson et al., 2020). Jones et al. (2013) found strong evidence through literature review that agricultural intensification and environmental changes increase epidemiological interactions between wildlife and livestock, contributing to zoonotic transfer. These pressures are further exacerbated by, for example, cavalier use of antibiotics stimulating antimicrobial resistance, as well as by the background of ongoing climate change acting as an aggravating factor (UNEP, 2020; Kreuder Johnson et al., 2020). Relationships between climate variables and the emergence and re-emergence of infectious diseases are complex. Some risks are expected to decline, such as those from water-vectored diseases under drier conditions in hotter climates, whilst others may increase, for example, the spread of some disease vector species to higher latitudes. A range of other factors, including different levels of access to education and capacities for adaptation (Khan et al., 2019), may contribute further to differing community vulnerabilities. Overall, the WHO (2003) expresses high confidence that the negative health effects of climate change outweigh positive effects at the global level, necessitating mitigation of climate change as well as adaptation measures, such as improving institutional and technological capacity, to strengthen health resilience to climate change. UNEP (2020) also identify population growth, urbanisation and globalisation5\nas important driving factors behind the emergence of novel infectious diseases in humans.",

IPBES (2019) found that 75% of the global land surface is already significantly altered, and 66% of oceanic areas are experiencing increasing cumulative impacts from human activities, while over 85% of global wetland area has been lost. Human resource appropriation in 2007 already accounted for 23.8% of potential net planetary primary productivity (Haberl et al., 2007), since which date the human population has increased by more than 15% (one billion people) on a planet with continuously degrading resources. Today, well into the Anthropocene (Crutzen and Stoermer, 2000), an estimated 96% of all mammalian biomass on Earth comprises humans and their livestock (Bar-On and Phillips, 2018). Industrial nitrogen fixation has increased exponentially since the 1940s, essentially doubling the amount of nitrogen fixed globally, with the amount of nitrogen fixed by human activities predicted to exceed that fixed by microbial processes by 2030 (Vitousek et al., 1997). Resultant eutrophication changes ecosystem structure, function and resilience (Chislock et al., 2013). In short, our cumulative activities exert a dominating influence on ecosystem structures and function (Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, 2005).",

Populations of many wild animal species are well under half the size they were in 1970 (WWF, 2018). Beyond the sheer loss of numbers of individuals and of species, we are also seeing unprecedented \u2018biotic homogenisation\u2019, in which the introduction of non-native species and the extinction of local biodiversity decreases the genetic, taxonomic and functional diversity of different locations (McKinney and Lockwood, 1999). The net result is to simplify ecosystems and to make them progressively less reflective of their original, local state. In turn, these increasingly vulnerable ecosystems are only capable of generating a narrower set of the ecosystem services on which human society relies. Despite various commitments intended to address these pressing problems, most indicators of the state of biodiversity have shown continued rates of decline with no significant recent slowing of the trends. Accurate or meaningful estimates of extinction rates are notoriously elusive, rates varying between taxa and geography. However, Ceballos et al. (2015) applied conservative assessments to calculate that average rate of vertebrate species loss over the last century is 100 times higher than the background rate, indicating that a sixth mass extinction is under way.",

            "text": "\nUNEP (2020) recognised five principal pressures increasing the emergence of zoonoses: deforestation and other land use changes; antimicrobial resistance; intensified agriculture and livestock production; the illegal and poorly regulated wildlife trade; and climate change. Habitat changes, mainly through modification for human uses, include deforestation and increasing \u2018land take\u2019 for agriculture, habitation and civil infrastructure. These changes directly bring wildlife and people into closer proximity, simultaneously also degrading ecosystem services, including disease regulation, through degrading natural barriers to transmission as well as undermining water security, which reduces opportunities for good hygiene practices. Risks of zoonotic diseases transferring to humans are particularly elevated in tropical forests, which naturally support high biodiversity, when subject to significant changes in land use that bring formerly isolated wild animals into closer proximity to humans (Allen et al., 2017). Numerous emergent infectious diseases are connected to human-induced changes in tropical rainforests (EcoHealth Alliance, 2019). For example, deforestation and landscape fragmentation have been observed to accelerate direct contact and transmission of zoonotic infections between wild nonhuman primates and humans in Ugandan forests (Bloomfield et al., 2020). Road construction supporting selective logging of relatively intact forest areas also increases contact between scattered village and urban populations with access to international travel, facilitating and accelerating the spread of emerging diseases (Wolfe et al., 2005). Deforestation is one of many negative trends \u2013 along with inter alia soil erosion, water resource depletion and eutrophication, emissions of climate-active gases, and deterioration of air quality \u2013 that together result from a combination of population, lifestyle and other pressures. Many of these pressures have arisen from technically efficient exploitation of ecosystems with scant or no regard for their renewability, or for the overall sustainability of those activities, leading to a degenerative socio-ecological cycle in which essential natural resources become progressively liquidated for short-term gains whilst undermining the capacities of ecosystems to provide security and opportunity for many in society (Everard, 2020).",

The expansion and growing intensification of livestock production, often as \u2018monocultures\u2019 of narrow genetic diversity, may be of particular concern in this regard, especially where this takes place in close proximity to high human populations. Although antibiotics are not effective against viruses, approximately 60% of infectious diseases in humans are caused by other zoonotic pathogens, many of which may develop antibiotic resistance as they are transferred to humans (Dafale et al., 2020).",

            "text": "Depletion of natural resources and ecosystem service flows increases pressure from people exploiting alternative food sources. It also undermines vital resources necessary for maintaining health, particularly access to safe, fresh water. Frequent washing has been identified as a key factor in slowing the spread of Covid-19 and other pathogens (UNICEF, 2020), reiterating long-standing basic disease management guidance (WHO, 2009). This is particularly the case for coronaviruses, as using soap breaks down their fatty outer layer. Degradation of water systems therefore plays a significant role in the potential spread of infections, including zoonotics, particularly for the least advantaged in society through undermining access to safe water and sanitation. Recognising such challenges, and in response to the unfolding Covid-19 pandemic, the WHO (2020) has recently made recommendations to improve hand hygiene practices to help prevent transmission, such as by: (1) providing universal access to public hand hygiene stations and making their use obligatory on entering and leaving any public or private commercial building and any public transport facility; and (2) improving access to hand hygiene facilities and practices in health care facilities. Many health agencies recommend washing hands for a minimum of 20 seconds up to 8-10 times per day. Taps in the average hand basin run at 2-3 litres per minute, implying a total water requirement of 7-8 litres of clean water per person per day, as well as appropriate soap and safe drying facilities, in order to maintain hand hygiene alone (Staddon et al., in press). These targets may be easy to achieve in wealthier and wetter parts of the world, yet as many as 1 in 5 people around the world lack access to a sufficient and secure supply of safe water. This is especially the case in parts of Africa, Asia and Latin America and in megacities elsewhere, particularly where overcrowded slum housing conditions prevail or peri-urban settlements lack infrastructure, with the consequence that such communities bear a disproportionate share of resultant global health burdens (UNICEF and WHO, 2019). For example, three people die every minute of diarrheal illnesses (1.5 million per year) and six people die every minute from respiratory diseases (3 million per year), risks substantially exacerbated by the Covid-19 pandemic, especially if the strategy of viral suppression cannot be supported through basic hand hygiene (Staddon et al., in press). Problems of water insecurity also extend into higher-income countries, with an estimated 57 million people across Europe and North America lacking piped water at home (WWAP, 2019). Furthermore, \u2018forgotten\u2019 and neglected populations, including prisoners, the homeless, refugees, undocumented migrants and displaced people are all at heightened risk of disease exposure and transmission due to their reliance on precarious water, sanitation and hygiene facilities (Panhuis, 2018). UN (2015) Sustainable Development Goal No.6 (SDG6) refers specifically to \u201cEnsure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all\u201d. A report on SDG6 in 2019 found that, despite some progress, billions of people still lack safe water, sanitation and handwashing facilities with most countries unlikely to reach full implementation of integrated water resources management by 2030. 785 million people were still lacking even basic drinking water services in 2017 (UN, 2019b). Accelerated transmission of Covid-19 and other zoonoses through underprivileged sectors of society leads to direct impacts for those individuals, families and communities, as well as creating potential reservoirs for subsequent transfer and resurgence of infections within wider populations. In an increasingly interconnected world, the resilience benefits of universally enhanced hygiene may provide a bulkhead against future health crises everywhere on earth, with international aid conferring mutual benefits to both recipients and donors.",

These include such measures as wage subsidies, interest rate cuts, quantitative easing, municipal bonds, expanded unemployment benefits, additional funds for medical care, lending facilities for smaller businesses, additional payments for people collecting government welfare support as well as the self-employed, child-care subsidies, job retraining for those losing jobs, and expanded insurance for health care workers. However, much of the world\u2019s population lives beyond the reach of such programmes (as examples, India and Uganda offered little social support beyond food aid) and the primary influence of market economics. These overlooked people include the world\u2019s large population of day labourers, dependent on finding work on a daily basis to earn money to buy food and other subsistence necessities, who cannot therefore easily lock themselves and their families down. Threats from both job and food insecurity may further increase vulnerabilities to infectious diseases. As one prominent example, following the introduction of a national lockdown throughout India on 24 March 2020, thousands of daily wage labourers started to migrate back to their home villages and towns, often walking tens or hundreds of miles, thrown into close proximity as a result and facing acute food and water insecurity both en route and on arriving home. The contribution of this migration to transmission of the virus is yet to be determined. As insecurity of water, food and livelihoods in home villages are major factors behind worker migration in India, a key strategic response to managing risks of disease transmission would be measures to restore ecosystem functioning to enhance village-level resource security, livelihood opportunities and self-sufficiency, preventing the need for distress migration whilst also enhancing hygiene.",

Two major essential transitions are proposed in a re-imagined, post-pandemic society. Firstly, a more concerted and rigorously applied ecocentric basis is required for decision-making across society, to reverse the current norms that tend to externalise, and thereby serve as drivers of, degeneration of ecosystems and their vital services. This in essence entails returning ecosystems to a more unimpacted state, as illustrated in Fig. 3, be that by restoration or by emulation through multi-beneficial nature-based solutions (Everard, 2020). Secondly, a more pro-social and equitable basis is also required. This includes recognition in development decisions and options appraisal of consequences for all in society, not just privileged and more influential sectors, with economic rewards recognising those integral to the smooth operation of society as demonstrated by those groups upon which society is now most dependent during pandemic management.",

Looking beyond the current Covid-19 crisis to a world more alert to the potential for recurrent and novel infections, strategic changes in direction are necessary. The foundational roles of ecosystems and their services in regulating zoonotic emergence and providing water and other resources essential to suppress transmission and facilitate disease treatment are also pertinent to a range of linked sustainability challenges arising from currently degrading socio-ecological cycles. These linked issues include, for example, concerns for climate change, food and water insecurity, distress migration and environmental refugees, potential conflict sparked by resource scarcity and the \u2018biodiversity crisis\u2019.",

This current pandemic sharply highlights how universal access to clean water is a vital tool in addressing the spread of the pandemic, also consistent with global commitments under UN Sustainable Development Goal No.6.

The DPSIR model has proved useful as a framework for organizing and assessing problems, and also for identifying contributory responses from the perspective of environmental considerations. This analysis reveals that emergence of the current Covid-19 pandemic, in common with many past and likely future zoonotic diseases, has roots in ecosystem depletion. Degradation of ecosystems and their services simultaneously increase risks of subsequent human-to-human transmission and effective care of the infected. It also highlights that strategic response options must necessarily include regeneration of the foundational resources of ecosystems and their services for greater future human security.",
