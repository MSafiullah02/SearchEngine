            "text": "SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is a positive-stranded RNA virus of the Coronaviridae family. It is the causative agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and infected over 8000 people around the world in 2002\u20132003 (Peiris et al., 2003, Rota et al., 2003). The genome of SARS-CoV encodes several structural proteins including the spike (S) glycoprotein, nucleocapsid protein, membrane protein and envelope protein (Marra et al., 2003). The S protein of SARS-CoV is consisted of 1255 amino acid residues with approximately 25% homology to that of the other human CoVs (Ho et al., 2004, Spiga et al., 2003). It mediates viral binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2), a cell surface zinc peptidase (Li et al., 2003). The S protein receptor-binding domain (S-RBD) was mapped to a fragment between residues 318 to 510 (Wong et al., 2004). Li et al. (2005) have recently solved the crystal structure of S-RBD complexed with ACE2 at 2.9 \u00c5 resolution. Their results demonstrate that S-RBD contains 2 subdomains: a core (residues 318 to 423) and an extended loop (residues 424 to 494). The latter, referred as the S protein receptor binding motif (S-RBM), is formed by 2 anti-parallel \u03b2-sheets (\u03b25 and \u03b26) folding into a gently concave surface, which makes all contacts with the ACE2 molecule (Li et al., 2005). Interestingly, 9 out of the 14 amino acid residues of S-RBM in direct contact with ACE2 are in the \u03b26 strand (residues 450 to 494), suggesting a possibility that the \u03b26 fragment alone might be able to bind with ACE2 with considerable affinity.",

DNA encoding truncated fragments covering the sequence of S450\u2013650, namely S-I (450\u2013510), S-II (511\u2013560), S-III (546\u2013595), S-IV (581\u2013630) and S-V (601\u2013650), were amplified by PCR using vector pET28a-S450\u2013650 (encoding for S450\u2013650 of SARS-CoV) as template. The resultant products were inserted into prokaryotic expression vector pET28a. DNA encoding GFP was inserted downstream the S protein genes for preparation of GFP fusion proteins S450\u2013650-GFP, S450\u2013510-GFP and S511\u2013650-GFP (Fig. 1A). Glycine- and serine-rich linkers of various length have been widely used in protein engineering since these linkers may offer little structure hindrance to folding proteins in their own constructs (Liu et al., 2005, Nardella et al., 2004). A linker sequence (GSGGSGS) was therefore introduced between S fragment and GFP. The recombinant products, expressed in E. coli, were purified to more than 90% homogeneity using Ni columns and examined by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis (Fig. 1, Fig. 2\n).",

As illustrated in Fig. 2, S-II (511\u2013560) and S-IV (581\u2013630) were strongly recognized by all 5 patient sera, while none of the other overlapping constructs produced detectable signals. These results imply that fragments between residues 511\u2013545 and 596\u2013600 represent either linear B cell epitopes or parts of conformational B cell epitopes predominantly recognized by human Abs produced following an infection of SARS-CoV.",

S-RBD-Fc is a fusion protein between the S-RBD domain (residues 318\u2013510) and Fc fragment of human IgG1. It has been shown to be able to bind with ACE2 receptor with high affinity (Kuba et al., 2005). As controls, S-RBD-Fc and human IgG-Fc were used to treat Vero E6 and also ACE2-negative 293T cells. After washes, the cells were subsequently treated with FITC-conjugated secondary Abs for FACS analysis. As illustrated in Figs. 4A and B, S450\u2013650-treated Vero E6 cells were specifically recognized by patient serum PT31 or mouse anti-S450\u2013650 antiserum, indicating specific binding of the recombinant S450\u2013650 to the cell surface. To further locate the site for receptor binding within the 450\u2013650 construct, we next employed fusion proteins S450\u2013510-GFP, S511\u2013650-GFP and S450\u2013650-GFP for direct staining of Vero E6 and 293T cells. As expected, S450\u2013650-GFP was able to label Vero E6, but not 293T cells and deletion of the 450\u2013510 sequence completely abolished its ability of doing so (Figs. 4D and E). It is noteworthy that the intensity of Vero E6 cell staining by S450\u2013650 (Fig. 4B) and S450\u2013650-GFP (Fig. 4D) was approximately 50% of that by S-RBD-Fc (Fig. 4C), while the fluorescence intensity of the S450\u2013510-GFP-stained cells was only 1/20 of that stained by S-RBD.",

It has been demonstrated that the S-RBD (residues 318\u2013510) contains immunodominant B cell epitopes and some of which are recognized by neutralizing Abs (He et al., 2005, He et al., 2004, Sui et al., 2004). Presumably, the neutralizing epitopes are located within the S-RBM region (residues 424\u2013494) which forms direct contacts with ACE2 (Li et al., 2005). However, this has so far not been confirmed by experimental data. In our WB assays, the \u03b26 strand (i.e. SI or S450\u2013510) was not recognized by convalescent patient sera (Fig. 2). Although the \u03b26 strand was predominantly recognized by antisera from mice after immunization with the S450\u2013650 construct (Fig. 2), such Abs did not show neutralization ability against SARS-CoV-S pseudovirus infection (Fig. 3). By immunizing mice with the S-RBD-Fc, which adopts a natural fold of the S-RBD (Kuba et al., 2005), He et al. (2005) generated a panel of mAbs, two of which were specific for linear epitopes between residues 450 and 510, neither of these mAbs was able to neutralize viral infection. This is in agreement with our data, shown in Fig. 3, and indicates that the lack of neutralization ability of the mouse Abs specific for linear sequences in the \u03b26 strand is likely a genuine phenomenon rather than the result of improper presentation in the context of the peptides.",

            "text": "An unexpected finding of this study is that construct S450\u2013510, either alone or in fusion with GFP, was relatively poor in binding to ACE2 compared with S450\u2013650, as determined in both Vero E6 cell staining (Fig. 4D) and SARS-CoV-S pseudovirus inhibition (Fig. 5B) experiments. There are several possible explanations for this phenomenon. In the case where GFP-fusion proteins were employed, it is possible that the ACE2-binding site on a \u223c 5.5 kDa peptide could be physically blocked by the > 20 kDa GFP. This blocking effect is significantly lessened in S450\u2013650-GFP construct that binds ACE2 efficiently, perhaps because of a buffering effect of residues 511\u2013650 between \u03b26 (i.e. 450\u2013510) and GFP. In addition, by starting the molecule from the middle of the S-RBM fold, the S450\u2013650 might be prone-to-misfold. Thirdly, sequences adjacent to S-RBM may also assist the receptor binding of S-RBM in a yet unknown mechanism. By virtue of the formation of inter or intra-molecular disulfide bonds, the binding of S450\u2013650 polypeptide for ACE2 could be stabilized and enhanced as well. Xiao et al. (2004) found that a dimeric state of S1 portion of the S protein could contribute to an increased overall affinity that may enhance fusion efficiency. This hypothesis may help explaining the fact that Abs against regions adjacent to the S-RBM exhibit neutralizing potential.",

As controls, Vero E6 cells and 293T cells were treated with S-RBD-Fc, or human IgG (0.5 \u03bcM), at 4 \u00b0C for 1 h and followed by FITC-conjugated goat anti-human IgG (C, F). For direct staining, Vero E6 (D), or 293T (E), cells were treated with GFP, S450\u2013510-GFP, S510\u2013650-GFP or S450\u2013650-GFP (0.5 \u03bcM) at 4 \u00b0C for 30 min.
