Other studies distinguished between the secreted and intracellular enzymes and suggested that there may be a family of heparanase proteins with different substrate specificities and potential functions [12] . Studies performed by Bame et al. focused on intracellular heparanase(s) and their involvement in normal catabolism of HS. It was claimed that inside cells, these enzymes are important for the normal catabolism of HS proteoglycans (HSPG), generating glycosaminoglycan fragments that are then transported to lysosomes and completely degraded. Characterization of the short glycosaminoglycans produced in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells suggested that multiple heparanases are necessary for the formation of the short HS chains [13] . Based on their ability to bind ion-exchange resins and their elution from gelfiltration columns, four separate heparanase activities were partially purified. All four activities cleave free glycosaminoglycans over a broad pH range of 3.5-6.5, suggesting that they act in the endosomal/lysosomal pathway. It was further suggested that the formation of short HSPG inside CHO cells may be a result of the concerted action of multiple heparanases, and may depend on the proportions of the different enzymes and the environment in which the chains are degraded [13] . * A large part of the lay summary presented below was taken from commentaries written by Drs. Eccles and Finkel [14, 15] in response to the heparanase cloning papers published in 1999 by Vlodavsky et al. [4] and Hulett et al. [1] . These commentaries were found suitable for the current 'historic review' by virtue of their accuracy and high relevance to heparanase research performed since then.",

            "text": "Tumor cell invasion and secondary spread through the blood and lymphatics is the hallmark of malignant disease and the greatest impediment to cancer cure. Two of the essential processes required for metastasis are neoangiogenesis and tumor cell invasion of the basement membrane (BM) and extracellular matrix (ECM). Prior to cloning of the heparanase gene, attention focused on serine and cysteine proteases and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). Although metastasizing cancer cells may produce as many as 25 different matrix-digesting metalloproteinases, cloning of the same heparanase gene by different groups [1] [2] [3] [4] indicated that there is only one heparanase so that if its activity can be inhibited, other heparanases shouldn't be around to cover for it [15] . In addition to the structural proteins (i.e., collagens, laminin, fibronectin, vitronectin) cleaved by MMPs in the BM and ECM, the other chief components are glycosaminoglycans, mainly heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG). HSPG are composed of a protein core covalently linked to HS glycosaminoglycan chains that interact closely with other ECM components. Endoglycosidase activity (heparanase) that degrades the HS side chains of HSPG is normally found mainly in platelets, placental trophoblasts, and leukocytes. Given their abundance in tumor tissues, it appears that the normal physiological functions of proteases and heparanases in embryonic morphogenesis, wound healing, tissue repair and inflammation have been effectively 'hijacked' by tumor cells.",

For example, basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and other heparin-binding growth factors (i.e., HB-EGF, VEGF, HGF) are sequestered by HS, providing a localized, readily accessible depot, protected from proteolytic degradation, yet available to activate cells and promote angiogenesis after being released by heparanase. It was suggested that the release of tissue-specific growth factors may be involved in organ selectivity of metastasis and the formation of a metastatic niche [17, 18] . Although these phenomena were well-documented, it has taken about 20 years to purify the heparanase protein and clone the respective gene mainly because of instability of the enzyme(s), its low abundance in normal cells and tissues and the lack of a robust, accurate and rapid assay for enzyme activity [14] .",

Anderson Cancer Center in Houston), Christopher Parish (John Curtin School of Medical Research, Canberra) and Israel Vlodavsky (Hadassah-Hebrew University, Jerusalem)] were following up on the finding that the natural anticoagulant, heparin, inhibits the spread of cancer in animals [15] . The prevailing belief was that heparin worked because it prevented platelets from clotting around cancer cells, an event likely to help the cells lodge into, and ultimately penetrate the vessel wall. But \"heparin\" is a family of molecules, only some of which inhibit clot formation. The three groups independently showed that it still inhibits metastasis, even when depleted of its anticlotting activity [14] . Only about 15 years later it was demonstrated that heparin inhibits heparanase enzymatic activity through competition with HS on binding to the heparin/HS binding domains (HBD) of heparanase [19] .",

            "text": "Both Parish [20] and Vlodavsky [21] had reported that heparanase helps immune cells traverse blood vessel walls on their way to infection sites. The evidence that it might be doing something similar for cancer cells immediately made researchers think about getting better heparanase inhibitors. But getting the pure enzyme proved to be difficult. Not only is heparanase unstable, but the only assay then available was slow and cumbersome [22, 23] . Nevertheless, the Israeli group finally managed to purify heparanase from a human liver cancer cell line and also from human placenta [4] , while the Australian group purified it from human platelets [24] . In parallel, Toyoshima and Nakajima [3] reported the purification of a human heparanase from an SV40-transformed embryonic fibroblast cell line, and Kussie et al. [2] isolated and purified the enzyme from human SK-HEP-1 hepatoma cells. After determining peptide amino acid sequences derived from the purified proteins, the researchers then screened EST databases looking for gene sequences that could encode those amino acid sequences. Contrary to expectations that there might be more than one heparanase, the four groups found themselves with the same gene -the only one like it in the databases. Soon after, genomic organization and chromosome localization of the newly identified human heparanase gene was reported [25] . Cloning, expression, and purification of mouse heparanase that is 77% identical to the human enzyme was reported by Miao et al. [26] . The recombinant mouse heparanase protein was purified to homogeneity from cell lysates by a combination of Con-A affinity chromatography, heparin affinity chromatography, and size exclusion chromatography, purification steps that are commonly used nowadays. Experiments confirmed that the newly cloned gene aids the spread of cancer cells. When Vlodavsky and his colleagues introduced the heparanase gene into nonmetastatic mouse melanoma and lymphoma cancer cells, they turned into rampantly malignant cells that colonized the lung and liver when injected into mice [4] . Parish, looking at several different types of rat cancer cells, found that their invasiveness correlates with the activity of their heparanase gene [1] . Conversely, inhibiting the enzyme inhibits cancer metastasis. Parish reported that a previously identified inhibitor of heparanase called PI-88 [27] decreased by 90% the number of lung tumors formed by breast cancer cells injected into rats. It also cut the blood supply of the primary tumors and slowed tumor growth [28] . The encouraging animal results have led Progen (Brisbane, Australia) to test the safety of the inhibitor in healthy volunteers, followed by clinical trials in cancer patients [29] .",

Because the reagents used in these studies lacked specificity, the conclusions were somewhat debatable and inconclusive. It took another 12 years to generate heparanase neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAb) and demonstrate their ability to inhibit lymphoma tumor growth and dissemination [33] . Notably, the inhibitory activity of the mAbs was lower than that of the heparin mimetics (i.e., PG545) [33] , further raising the issue of drug specificity vs. efficiency. Nowadays, heparanase is well established as a cancer drug target, and several inhibitors have progressed to clinical trials [31, 34] . In recent years, heparanase has also been implicated in a range of other diseases, such as diabetes and its complications [35] [36] [37] , kidney disease [38] , atherosclerosis [39, 40] and viral infections [41] , to name a few, which continues to fuel research into this protein.",

Moreover, subsequent studies revealed that PA activity is residing in the ECM itself [48] . Thus, incubation of plasminogen on ECM resulted in plasmin generation and heating the ECM inactivated its ability to generate plasmin upon incubation with plasminogen. It was concluded that a proteolytic activity expressed by the tumor cells and/or residing in the tumor microenvironment (i.e., ECM) participate synergistically in sequential degradation of the EM' HS.

For this purpose, we prepared various species of low-sulfated or LMW heparins, all of which exhibited less than 7% of the anticoagulant activity of native heparin. N-sulfate groups of heparin are necessary for its heparanase inhibitory activity but can be substituted by an acetyl group provided that the O-sulfate groups are retained. O-sulfate groups could be removed provided that the N positions were resulfated. Total desulfation of heparin abolished its heparanase inhibitory activity. Heparan sulfate was a 25-fold less potent heparanase inhibitor than native heparin. Efficiency of LMW heparins to inhibit degradation of HS in ECM decreased with their main molecular size, and a synthetic pentasaccharide, representing the binding site to antithrombin III, was devoid of inhibitory activity. Similar results were obtained with heparanase activities released from platelets, neutrophils, and lymphoma cells. We propose that heparanase inhibiting nonanticoagulant heparins may interfere with dissemination of blood borne tumor cells and development of experimental autoimmune diseases [51] .",

The action of this enzyme, rather than that of other ECMsolubilizing enzymes, was inhibited by 5 antimetastatic sulphated polysaccharides but not by 4 polysaccharides that failed to inhibit metastasis. Additional experiments indicated that the anti-coagulant activity of the polysaccharides probably plays a minor role in their anti-metastatic effects since heparin, almost completely depleted (98) (99) .5%) of heparin molecules with anti-coagulant activity by passage over an anti-thrombin III column, retained its ability to inhibit 13,762 MAT heparanases and was almost as effective as unfractionated heparin at inhibiting tumour-cell metastasis. Collectively, these data suggest that sulphated polysaccharides inhibit the metastasis of 13,762 MAT cells by inhibiting tumour-cell-derived heparanases involved in the penetration of the vascular endothelium and its underlying basement membrane by tumour cells.

Heparin and fucoidan both completely inhibited passive EAE even when treatment was begun 3 days after transfer of cells. Pentosan sulfate was partially inhibitory whereas chondroitin-4-sulfate had no effect. Inhibition was not merely due to killing of the cells since active sensitization 14 days after cell transfer resulted in an early onset of disease indicating the persistence of transferred cells as memory cells. Although all the inhibitory polysaccharides are anticoagulants, it would appear that this function alone is not the reason for inhibition since a heparin preparation devoid of anticoagulant activity also partially inhibited EAE. Actively induced EAE was also significantly delayed by treatment with heparin. The results are discussed in terms of the polysaccharides inhibiting the enzymatic dependent movement of lymphocytes across central nervous system vascular endothelium [53] .",

In contrast, at the hydrogen ion concentration of a quiescent tissue, heparanase binds specifically to HS molecules without degrading them, and thereby anchors CD4+ human T lymphocytes.

PBP and its N-truncated derivatives, CTAP-III and neutrophil activating peptide-2 are CXC chemokines, a group of molecules involved in inflammation and wound healing. SDS-PAGE analysis of the purified heparanase resulted in a single broad band at 8-10 kDa, the known molecular weight of PBP and its truncated derivatives. Gel filtration chromatography of heparanase resulted in peaks of activity corresponding to monomers, dimers, and tetramers. N-terminal sequence analysis of the same preparation indicated that only PBP and truncated derivatives were present, and commercial CTAP-III from three suppliers had heparanase activity. Antisera produced in animals immunized with a C-terminal synthetic peptide of PBP inhibited heparanase activity by 95%, compared with activity of the purified enzyme in the presence of the preimmune sera. The enzyme was determined to be an endoglucosaminidase, and it degraded both heparin and HS with optimal activity at pH 5.8.

We examined whether this is the case by purifying heparanase activity from CHO cell homogenates. Based on their ability to bind ion-exchange resins and their elution from gel-filtration columns, four separate heparanase activities were partially purified. All four activities cleave free glycosaminoglycans over a broad pH range (3.5-6.5), suggesting that they act in the endosomal/lysosomal pathway. The sizes of the short HS chains generated by the partially purified heparanases ranged from 6 to 9 kDa. Interestingly, all four enzymes generate short glycosaminoglycans with a sulfate-rich, modified domain at the non-reducing end of the newly formed chain. Our findings suggest that the formation of short HS glycosaminoglycans inside CHO cells may be a result of the concerted action of multiple heparanases, and may depend on the proportions of the different enzymes and the environment in which the chains are degraded [13] . * As demonstrated in the above two studies, there were several serious attempts to purify the heparanase enzyme, yet subsequent studies failed to confirm the results.",

[58] found that overexpression of the cDNA-encoding heparanase conferred a metastatic phenotype in lymphoma cells. Nevertheless, it was argued that the ability of increased heparanase levels to induce a metastatic phenotype does not necessarily imply that tumors make use of heparanase to drive tumor dissemination. In subsequent studies, Edovitsky et al. [57] have attempted to address this shortcoming by using ribozyme and small interfering RNA (siRNA) technology to knock down the levels of endogenous heparanase. The authors showed that, in models of experimental and spontaneous metastases, these strategies attenuated the ability of diverse tumor cells, including melanoma, mammary adenocarcinoma, lymphoma, and glioma cells, to invade in vitro and to colonize distant sites including the liver and lungs. This study [57] and an earlier study [59] performed by Uno et al. provided strong support for a role of heparanase in the metastatic process. Nevertheless, caution was taken in predicting clinical efficacy given that tumor cells have a remarkable system of redundant mechanisms that can efficiently overcome the targeting of single molecules [60] . This redundancy is one of the contributing mechanisms underlying the lack of clinical benefit seen with metalloproteinase inhibitors in cancer patients [61] . Taking into account that only one HS-degrading endoglycosidase was identified, redundancy is not considered a problem in targeting heparanase as compared to metalloproteinases.",

            "text": "An equally important issue raised by Boyed and Nakajima [56] relating to the utility of anti-heparanase and other anti-metastatic therapies in cancer treatment concerns the fact that, at the time of presentation, the majority of patients already have disseminated disease. Consequently, treatment of such patients with antiheparanase regimens might be akin to closing the barn door after the horse has bolted [56] . Thus, how could a knock-out punch against heparanase be useful in the treatment of cancer patients? There are at least two options. First, with increasing public awareness, and as cancer screenings become more prevalent in the general population, the number of patients diagnosed with early-stage disease should increase. By definition, such tumors are still localized and are therefore more amenable to therapy with anti-metastasis agents. Second, considering the proangiogenic effects of heparanase first documented by Edovitsky et al. [62] and Elkin et al. [63] , anti-heparanase drugs may have a static effect on both the primary tumor and distant tumor lesions by preventing the establishment of tumor vasculature necessary for tumor growth beyond 1 mm 3 . These considerations made a compelling case for the role of heparanase in tumor progression. The extent to which this information can be exploited in novel therapies depends on the development of specific inhibitors that target heparanase and the blockade of redundant mechanisms that compensate for the loss of heparanase in cancer. This statement was rightly written (2004) in an editorial to the gene silencing paper [56] and is relevant nowadays as well.",

Physical association between estrogen receptor (ER) and the heparanase promoter was confirmed by ChIP analysis. ChIP analysis, also revealed that wild type p53 inhibits transcription of the heparanase gene by direct binding to its promoter, while mutated, tumor-derived variants of p53 lose this inhibitory ability and in some cases even up regulate heparanase gene expression [71] . Examining a series of tumor-derived cell lines, we have found that cells which exhibit heparanase activity also harbor at least one unmethylated allele [72] , while cell lines which exhibit no heparanase expression or activity were found to harbor fully methylated alleles. Treating these cells with demethylating agents such as 5-azacytidine restored heparanase activity accompanied by augmented metastatic capacity in vivo [69, 72] . Cathepsin L plays a critical role in the processing and conversion of latent heparanase into its active form [73] . Interestingly, promoter methylation [74] and EGR family members are also involved in cathepsin L activation [75] , suggesting that heparanase and cathepsin L share some regulatory aspects. Applying the RIP1-Tag2 tumor model, Joyce et al. demonstrated that while cathepsin L expression was restricted to tumor cells, the majority of heparanase appeared to originate from infiltrating immune cells [76] . Thus, pro-heparanase secreted from one cell type (inflammatory cells) can be activated by cathepsin L secreted by another compartment (cancer cells) in cooperation that drives tumor development [18] . Notably, regulation of both heparanase and cathepsin L does not rely solely on gene transcription but rather involves complex regulatory mechanisms. Important regulatory elements of cathepsin L were identified in 5\u2032, and 3\u2032 untranslated regions (UTR) of the gene [77] . Likewise, Arvatz et al. revealed post-transcriptional regulation of heparanase gene expression by a 3\u2032 AU-rich element in the 3\u2032UTR of the gene [78] .",

Based upon this information and results from protein analysis and mass spectrometry, we propose a scheme to define the structural organization of heparanase in relation to its precursor forms, proheparanase and pre-proheparanase. The 8-and 50-kDa chains which make up the active enzyme reside, respectively, at the NH (2)-and COOH-terminal regions of the inactive precursor, proheparanase.

Furthermore, secondary structure predictions suggested that heparanase is likely to contain an (alpha/beta) (8) TIM-barrel fold, which is common to the GH-A families. Based on sequence alignments with a number of glycosyl hydrolases from GH-A, Glu(225) and Glu(343) of human heparanase were identified as the likely proton donor and nucleophile residues, respectively. The substitution of these residues with alanine and the subsequent expression of the mutant heparanases in COS-7 cells demonstrated that the HS-degrading capacity of both was abolished. In contrast, the alanine substitution of two other glutamic acid residues (Glu(378) and Glu(396)), both predicted to be outside the active site, did not affect heparanase activity. These data suggest that heparanase is a member of the clan A glycosyl hydrolases and has a common catalytic mechanism that involves two conserved acidic residues, a putative proton donor at Glu(225) and a nucleophile at Glu(343) [80] . *",

Interestingly, not only the processed 50 kDa, but also the 65 kDa heparanase precursor was localized to perinuclear vesicles, suggesting that heparanase processing occurs in lysosomes. Indeed, heparanase processing was completely inhibited by chloroquine and bafilomycin A1, inhibitors of lysosome proteases. Similarly, processing of membrane-targeted heparanase was also chloroquine-sensitive, further ruling out the plasma membrane as the heparanase processing site.

A 3.5-kb promoter region of the HPR1 gene was cloned. Sequence analysis revealed that the TATA-less, GC-rich promoter of the HPR1 gene belongs to the family of housekeeping genes. This 3.5kb promoter region exhibited strong promoter activity in two thyroid tumor cell lines. Truncation analysis of the HPR1 promoter identified a minimal 0.3-kb region that had strong basal promoter activity. Truncation and mutational analysis of the HPR1 promoter revealed three Sp1 sites and four Ets-relevant elements (ERE) significantly contributing to basal HPR1 promoter activity. Binding to the Sp1 sites by Sp1 and to the ERE sites by GA-binding protein (GABP) was confirmed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay and competition and supershift electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Co-transfection of Sp-and GABP-deficient Drosophila SL-2 cells with the HPR1 promoter-driven luciferase construct plus the expression vector encoding the Sp1, Sp3, or GABP gene induced luciferase gene expression. Mutation or truncation of the Sp1 or ERE sites reduced luciferase expression in both SL-2 cells and thyroid tumor cell lines.

The important question of the role of EGR1 in regulating heparanase transcription in tumor cells was then assessed. Studies were carried out in four epithelial tumor lines of different tissue origin. Functional dissection of the heparanase promoter identified a 280-bp region that was critical for transcription of the heparanase gene. Transactivation studies using an EGR1 expression vector co-transfected with a reporter construct containing the 280-bp region showed EGR1-activated heparanase promoter activity in a dose-dependent manner in prostate or breast adenocarcinoma and colon carcinoma cell lines. In contrast, overexpression of EGR1 resulted in a dose-dependent repression of promoter activity in melanoma cells. Using site-directed mutagenesis the 280-bp region was found to contain two functional EGR1 sites and electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed binding of EGR1 to both of these sites upon activation of tumor cells. Furthermore, the heparanase promoter region containing the EGR1 sites was also inducible in tumor cells and induction corresponded to HPSE expression levels.

Constructing the 3\u2032 UTR immediately following the heparanase cDNA reduces heparanase enzymatic activity and protein levels, resulting in decreased cellular invasion capacity. We further identified a 185-bp sequence within the 3\u2032 UTR that mediates heparanase down-regulation, and characterized an adenine (A)/uracil (U)-rich consensus element (ARE) within this region. Deletion of the entire 185-bp region or the ARE eliminated the inhibitory effect of the 3\u2032 UTR, resulting in elevated heparanase levels and formation of larger tumor xenografts indistinguishable from those produced by heparanase-overexpressing cells in terms of size, vascularization, and Akt activation.

Using miR and a RNAhybrid, we identified miR-1258 as a candidate micro RNA that may directly target HPSE and suppress BMBC. We found that miR-1258 levels inversely correlated with heparanase expression, enzymatic activity, and cancer cell metastatic propensities, being lowest in highly aggressive BMBC cell variants compared with either nontumorigenic or nonmetastatic human mammary epithelial cells. These findings were validated by analyses of miR-1258 and heparanase content in paired clinical specimens of normal mammary gland versus invasive ductal carcinoma, and primary breast cancer versus BMBC. In regulatory experiments, miR-1258 inhibited the expression and activity of heparanase in BMBC cells, whereas modulating heparanase blocked the phenotypic effects of miR-1258. In functional experiments, stable expression of miR-1258 in BMBC cells inhibited heparanase in vitro cell invasion and experimental brain metastasis.

The present study indicates a highly significant correlation of HPSE gene SNPs rs4693608 and rs4364254 and their combination with the risk of developing acute GVHD. Moreover, the study revealed that discrepancy between recipient and donor in these SNPs may elevate significantly the risk of acute GVHD.

In addition, HPSE gene SNPs disclosed a correlation with extensive chronic GVHD, nonrelapse mortality, and overall survival.

For this purpose, nonmetastatic Eb mouse lymphoma cells were transfected with the predominantly intracellular human heparanase or with a readily secreted chimeric construct composed of the human enzyme and the chicken heparanase signal peptide. Eb cells overexpressing the secreted heparanase invaded a reconstituted basement membrane to a much higher extent than cells overexpressing the intracellular enzyme. Cell invasion was inhibited in the presence of laminaran sulfate, a potent inhibitor of heparanase activity and experimental metastasis. The increased invasiveness in vitro was reflected in vivo by rapid and massive liver colonization and accelerated mortality. In fact, mice inoculated with cells expressing the secreted enzyme succumb because of liver metastasis and dysfunction, as early as 10 days after s.c. inoculation of the cells, when their tumor burden did not exceed 1% of body weight. Cell surface localization and secretion of heparanase markedly stimulated tumor angiogenesis, as demonstrated by a 4-six-fold increase in vessel density and functionality evaluated by MRI of tumors produced by cells expressing the secreted vs. the non-secreted heparanase, consistent with actual counting of blood vessels. Altogether, our results indicate that the potent proangiogenic and prometastatic properties of heparanase are tightly regulated by its cellular localization and secretion. The increased potency of the secreted enzyme makes it a promising target for anticancer drug development [58] .",

However, such investigations relied on the use of heparin-mimicking molecules to inhibit heparanase activity. Because the reagents used in those previous studies lacked specificity, the conclusions drawn from the studies are somewhat debatable. Edovitsky et al. [57] applied ribozyme and small interfering RNA (siRNA) technology to knock down the levels of endogenous heparanase. The authors convincingly show that, in models of experimental and spontaneous metastases, these strategies attenuate the ability of diverse tumor cells, including melanoma, mammary adenocarcinoma, lymphoma, and glioma cells, to invade in vitro and to colonize distant sites including the liver and lungs. These and other results [59] provide strong support for a role for heparanase in the metastatic process. Moreover, these studies can be used to rationalize the development of anti-heparanase strategies for cancer patients. * The above description was taken from a commentary written by Boyd & Nakajima [56] .",

Heparanase enzyme activity is required for robust enhancement of exosome secretion because enzymatically inactive forms of heparanase do not dramatically increase exosome secretion.

Heparanase was present on the exosome surface where it was capable of degrading heparan sulfate embedded within an ECM. When exposed to myeloma cells, chemoexosomes transferred their heparanase cargo to those cells, enhancing their HS degrading activity and leading to activation of ERK signaling and an increase in shedding of the syndecan-1 proteoglycan. Exposure of chemoexosomes to macrophages enhanced their secretion of TNF-\u03b1, an important myeloma growth factor.

However, the mechanism whereby this enzyme regulates gene expression remains unknown. We previously reported that elevation of heparanase levels in myeloma cells causes a dramatic reduction in the amount of syndecan-1 in the nucleus. Because HS has been shown to inhibit the activity of histone acetyltransferase (HAT) enzymes in vitro, we hypothesized that the reduction in nuclear syndecan-1 in cells expressing high levels of heparanase would result in increased HAT activity leading to stimulation of protein transcription. We found that myeloma cells or tumors expressing high levels of heparanase and low levels of nuclear syndecan-1 had significantly higher levels of HAT activity when compared with cells or tumors expressing low levels of heparanase. High levels of HAT activity in heparanase-high cells were blocked by SST0001, an inhibitor of heparanase. Restoration of high syndecan-1 levels in heparanase-high cells diminished nuclear HAT activity, establishing syndecan-1 as a potent inhibitor of HAT. Exposure of heparanase-high cells to anacardic acid, an inhibitor of HAT activity, significantly suppressed their expression of VEGF and MMP-9, two genes known to be up-regulated following elevation of heparanase. These results reveal a novel mechanistic pathway driven by heparanase expression, which leads to decreased nuclear syndecan-1, increased HAT activity, and up-regulation of transcription of multiple genes that drive an aggressive tumor phenotype [104] .",

Here, we report the unexpected finding that heparanase enters the nucleus of activated human T lymphocytes and regulates the transcription of a cohort of inducible immune response genes by controlling histone H 3 methylation patterns. It was found that nuclear heparanase preferentially associates with euchromatin. Genomewide ChIP-on-chip analyses showed that heparanase is recruited to both the promoter and transcribed regions of a distinct cohort of transcriptionally active genes. Knockdown and overexpression of the heparanase gene also showed that chromatinbound heparanase is a prerequisite for the transcription of a subset of inducible immune response genes in activated T cells. Furthermore, the actions of heparanase seem to influence gene transcription by associating with the demethylase LSD1, preventing recruitment of the methylase MLL and thereby modifying histone H 3 methylation patterns. These data indicate that heparanase belongs to an emerging class of proteins that play an important role in regulating transcription in addition to their well-recognized extra-nuclear functions [105] . *",

Moreover, the C-domain was found to mediate nonenzymatic functions of heparanase, facilitating Akt phosphorylation, cell proliferation, and tumor xenograft progression. These findings support the notion that heparanase exerts enzymatic activity-independent functions, and identify, for the first time, a protein domain responsible for heparanase-mediated signaling.

Activated NF-\u03baB signaling was also found to drive high heparanase expression in drug resistant myeloma cell lines. In addition to enhancing heparanase expression, chemotherapy also caused release of heparanase by tumor cells into the conditioned medium. This soluble heparanase was taken up by macrophages and triggered an increase in TNF-\u03b1 production. Heparanase is also taken up by tumor cells where it induced expression of HGF, VEGF and MMP-9 and activated ERK and Akt signal-ing pathways. These changes induced by heparanase are known to be associated with the promotion of an aggressive tumor phenotype. Importantly, the heparanase inhibitor Roneparstat diminished the uptake and the downstream effects of soluble heparanase.

Using histological specimens from ulcerative colitis (UC) patients and a mouse model of dextran sodium sulfate-induced colitis, we found that heparanase was constantly overexpressed and activated throughout the disease. We demonstrate, using heparanase-overexpressing transgenic mice, that heparanase overexpression markedly increased the incidence and severity of colitis-associated colonic tumors. We found that highly coordinated interactions between the epithelial compartment (contributing heparanase) and mucosal macrophages preserved chronic inflammatory conditions and created a tumor-promoting microenvironment characterized by enhanced NF-\u03baB signaling and induction of STAT3. Our results indicate that heparanase generates a vicious cycle that powers colitis and the associated tumorigenesis: heparanase, acting synergistically with the intestinal flora, stimulates macrophage activation, while macrophages induce production (via TNF-\u03b1-dependent mechanisms) and activation (via secretion of cathepsin L) of heparanase contributed by the colon epithelium. Thus, disruption of the heparanasedriven chronic inflammatory circuit is highly relevant to the design of therapeutic interventions in colitis and the associated cancer [121] . *",

Ex vivo treatment of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells with heparanase resulted in the release of a range of proinflammatory cytokines including IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10 and TNF. A similar pattern of cytokine release was also observed when cells were treated with soluble HS. Furthermore, heparanase-induced cytokine release was abolished by enzymaticinhibitors of heparanase, suggesting that this process is mediated via the enzymatic release of cell surface HS fragments. As soluble HS can signal through the Toll-like receptor (TLR) pathway, heparanase may promote the upregulation of cytokines through the generation of heparanase-cleaved fragments of HS. In support of this hypothesis, mouse spleen cells lacking the key TLR adaptor molecule MyD88 demonstrated an abolition of cytokine release after heparanase stimulation. Furthermore, TLR4-deficient spleen cells showed reduced cytokine release in response to heparanase treatment, suggesting that TLR4 is involved in this response. Consistent with these observations, the pathway involved in cytokine upregulation was identified as being NF-\u03baB-dependent. These data identify a new mechanism for heparanase in promoting the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines that is likely to be important in regulating cell migration and inflammation [122] . * Heparanase triggers upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines through the generation of heparanase-cleaved fragments of HS.",

However, how PG545 exerts its antitumor effect remains incompletely defined. Here, using murine models of lymphoma, we determined that the antitumor effects of PG545 are critically dependent on NK cell activation and that NK cell activation by PG545 requires TLR9. We demonstrate that PG545 does not activate TLR9 directly but instead enhances TLR9 activation through the elevation of the TLR9 ligand CpG in DCs. Specifically, PG545 treatment resulted in CpG accumulation in the lysosomal compartment of DCs, leading to enhanced production of IL-12, which is essential for PG545-mediated NK cell activation. Overall, these results reveal that PG545 activates NK cells and that this activation is critical for the antitumor effect of PG545.

Heparanase-dependent production of IL-8 was detected in two human colorectal carcinoma cell lines. Addition of a heparanase inhibitor Heparastatin (SF4) did not influence MCP-1 production, while both latent and mature forms of heparanase augmented MCP-1 release, suggesting that heparanase catalytic activity was dispensable for MCP-1 production. In contrast, addition of heparin to the medium suppressed MCP-1 release in a dose-dependent manner. Similarly, targeted suppression of Ext1 by RNAi significantly suppressed cell surface expression of HS and MCP-1 production in colon 26 cells. Taken together, it is concluded that colon 26 cells transduce the heparanase-mediated signal through HS binding.

Heparanase deficiency did not affect development, differentiation, or tissue localization of NK cells under steady-state conditions. However, mice lacking heparanase specifically in NK cells (Hpsefl/fl NKp46-iCre mice) were highly tumor prone when challenged with the carcinogen methylcholanthrene (MCA). Hpsefl/fl NKp46-iCre mice were also more susceptible to tumor growth than were their littermate controls when challenged with the established mouse lymphoma cell line RMA-S-RAE-1\u03b2, which overexpresses the NK cell group 2D (NKG2D) ligand RAE-1\u03b2, or when inoculated with metastatic melanoma, prostate carcinoma, or mammary carcinoma cell lines. NK cell invasion of primary tumors and recruitment to the site of metastasis were strictly dependent on the presence of heparanase. Cytokine and immune checkpoint blockade immunotherapy for metastases was compromised when NK cells lacked heparanase. Our data suggest that heparanase plays a critical role in NK cell invasion into tumors and thereby tumor progression and metastases.

We therefore studied the capacity of human in vitro-cultured CAR-T cells to degrade components of the ECM. In contrast to freshly isolated T lymphocytes, we found that in vitro-cultured T lymphocytes lack expression of the enzyme heparanase (HPSE), which degrades heparan sulfate proteoglycans, the main components of ECM. We found that HPSE mRNA is downregulated in in vitro-expanded T cells, which may be a consequence of p53 (officially known as TP53, encoding tumor protein 53) binding to the HPSE gene promoter. We therefore engineered CAR-T cells to express HPSE and showed their improved capacity to degrade the ECM, which promoted tumor T cell infiltration and antitumor activity.

Although T cell dependent, the molecular mechanisms triggering \u03b2 cell death have not been fully elucidated. Here, we report that HS is expressed at extraordinarily high levels within mouse islets and is essential for \u03b2 cell survival. In vitro, \u03b2 cells rapidly lost their HS and died. \u03b2 Cell death was prevented by HS replacement, a treatment that also rendered the \u03b2 cells resistant to damage from ROS. In vivo, autoimmune destruction of islets in NOD mice was associated with production of catalytically active heparanase by islet-infiltrating MNCs and loss of islet HS. Furthermore, in vivo treatment with the heparanase inhibitor PI-88 preserved intra-islet HS and protected NOD mice from T1D. These results identified HS as a critical molecular requirement for islet \u03b2 cell survival and HS degradation as a mechanism for \u03b2 cell destruction.

Here, we further investigated the role of these proteins in DN, and demonstrated that endothelin-1 activates podocytes to release heparanase. Furthermore, conditioned podocyte culture medium increased glomerular transendothelial albumin passage in a heparanase-dependent manner. In mice, podocyte-specific knockout of the endothelin receptor prevented the diabetesinduced increase in glomerular heparanase expression, consequent reduction in heparan sulfate expression and endothelial glycocalyx thickness, and development of proteinuria observed in wild-type counterparts. Our data suggest that in diabetes, endothelin-1 signaling, as occurs in endothelial activation, induces heparanase expression in the podocyte, damage to the glycocalyx, proteinuria, and renal failure.

We investigated the mechanism by which endothelial cells (EC) and cardiomyocytes operate together to enable continuous translocation of LPL after diabetes. EC were co-cultured with myocytes, exposed to high glucose, and uptake of endothelial heparanase into myocytes was determined. Upon uptake, the effect of nuclear entry of heparanase was also investigated. A streptozotocin model of diabetes was used to expand our in vitro observations. In high glucose, EC-derived latent heparanase was taken up by cardiomyocytes by a caveolae-dependent pathway using HSPGs. This latent heparanase was converted into an active form in myocyte lysosomes, entered the nucleus, and upregulated gene expression of matrix metalloproteinase-9. The net effect was increased shedding of HSPGs from the myocyte surface, releasing LPL for its onwards translocation to the coronary lumen. EC-derived heparanase regulates the ability of the cardiomyocyte to send LPL to the coronary lumen. This adaptation, although acutely beneficial, could be catastrophic chronically because excess FA causes lipotoxicity. Inhibiting heparanase function could offer a new strategy for managing cardiomyopathy observed after diabetes [136] . * See also comment entitled 'Heparanase shakes hands with lipoprotein lipase: a tale of two cells' [137] .

We postulated that sepsis-associated ALI is initiated by degradation of the pulmonary endothelial glycocalyx, leading to neutrophil adherence and inflammation. Using intravital microscopy, we found that endotoxemia in mice rapidly induced pulmonary microvascular glycocalyx degradation via tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1)-dependent mechanisms. Glycocalyx degradation involved the specific loss of heparan sulfate and coincided with activation of endothelial heparanase, a TNF-\u03b1-responsive, heparan sulfate-specific glucuronidase. Glycocalyx degradation increased the availability of endothelial surface adhesion molecules to circulating microspheres and contributed to neutrophil adhesion. Heparanase inhibition prevented endotoxemia-associated glycocalyx loss and neutrophil adhesion and, accordingly, attenuated sepsis-induced ALI and mortality in mice. These findings are potentially relevant to human disease, as sepsis-associated respiratory failure in humans was associated with higher plasma heparan sulfate degradation activity; moreover, heparanase content was higher in human lung biopsies showing diffuse alveolar damage than in normal human lung tissue [140] . * See additional studies on heparanase and the glycocalyx [133, 141] .",

            "text": "Heparanase exerts strong pro-tumorigenic properties, promoting all aspects of tumor development (tumor initiation, growth, and metastasis) and chemo-resistance. The enzyme is expressed by tumor cells and cells of the tumor microenvironment and functions extracellularly as well as inside the cell. Collectively, the emerging premise is that heparanase expressed by tumor cells and cells of the tumor microenvironment is a dominant regulator of the aggressive phenotype of cancer, an important contributor to the poor outcome of cancer patients and a prime target for therapy. As the investigation of heparanase proceeds, new roles for the enzyme in diverse processes such as signal transduction, gene regulation, exosome formation, autophagy, activation of innate immune cells, chemo-resistance, are emerging and thus widening the impact of this enzyme [144] . It appears that heparanase functions extracellularly to remodel the ECM and regulate the bioavailability of ECM-bound factors, as well as inside the cell, augmenting, among other effects, gene transcription, and HS turnover. Unraveling these and other aspects of heparanase biology is ongoing and is critical to our understanding of its multiple functions in health and disease. Central to some of the downstream effects of heparanase is the enzyme's ability to regulate gene transcription. At the molecular level, nuclear heparanase appears, among other effects, to regulate histone 3 lysine 4 (H3K4) methylation by influencing the recruitment of demethylases to transcriptionally active genes [105] . Yet, our understanding of heparanase nuclear accessibility and mode of action is far from being complete. An important challenge in the field rests on structure-based rational development of clinically effective inhibitors (heparin mimics, neutralizing antibodies, small molecules) of heparanase that will be applied to treat cancer, inflammation and other diseases. A limiting factor in anti-heparanase drug development is the lack of a high throughput screening and validation assays. Most assays continue to use heterogeneous substrates prepared by derivatization of HS or heparin/LMWH in various ways. These assays are limited by their heterogeneity, semiquantitative nature, multiple enzyme cleavage sites and inappropriateness for use in biological samples. Advances in the synthesis of simple synthetic oligosaccharide substrates with a single point of cleavage will ultimately lead to a \"gold standard\" assay for detailed kinetic analyses [23] . Also, undesirable effects of anti-heparanase therapy should be considered. For example, it was recently reported that heparanase plays a critical role in NK cell invasion into tumors and thereby tumor progression and metastases. It was shown that cytokine and immune checkpoint blockade immunotherapy for metastases were compromised when NK cells lacked heparanase [127] . Likewise, it was found that in contrast to freshly isolated T lymphocytes, HPSE mRNA is downregulated in in vitro-expanded T cells. This may explain the reduced ability of cultured CAR-T cells to penetrate stroma-rich solid tumors compared with lymphoid tissues. In fact, engineering the CAR-T cells to express HPSE resulted in their improved capacity to degrade the ECM, which promoted tumor T cell infiltration and antitumor activity [128] . It was suggested that the use of this strategy might enhance the activity of CAR-T cells in individuals with stroma-rich solid tumors. These results should be considered when systemically treating cancer patients with heparanase inhibitors, since the potential adverse effect on NK and CAR-T cells on cell infiltration might limit the antitumor activity of the inhibitors [128] . Yet, these effects appear negligible given that heparanase knock-out mice exhibit no obvious immunological and other deficits [95] , implying that inhibition of heparanase will cause minimal side effects in cancer patients. Remarkably, heparanase inhibitors were effective even when the xenografted tumor cells were devoid of heparanase, emphasizing the significance of heparanase contributed by cells residing in the tumor microenvironment. It appears that targeting the tumor microenvironment by heparanase inhibitors enhances the antitumor activity of approved therapies, further providing a strong rationale for applying anti-heparanase therapy in combination with conventional anti-cancer drugs.",

Hpa2 appears to attenuate tumor growth via inhibition of heparanase, decreasing the expression of pro-angiogenic mediators and inducing the manifestation of genes involved in tumor suppression and cell differentiation (see chapters by Mckenzie and by Roberts & Woolf in this book). It appears that Hpa2 functions in heparanase activity-and HS-dependent and independent manners, and regulates the expression of selected genes that affect tumor vascularity, tumor fibrosis, cell differentiation, and apoptosis of cancer cells, resulting in tumor suppression [144, [146] [147] [148] [149] .

            "text": "Personal Notes I would like to close with a more personal note. I became interested in cell interaction with the ECM about 40 years ago just before finishing my postdoctoral research under the supervision of Prof. Denis Gospodarowicz (UCSF). We were among the first to realize that the ECM plays an active role in orchestrating cellular responses to both normal and pathological situations [149] [150] [151] [152] . The emerging concept was one of an active interplay between cells and the ECM where cells synthesize matrix components which in turn dictate and regulate cell shape and function. The impact of these studies is clearly indicated by the current awareness of the ECM and the tumor microenvironment as key elements in the regulation of cell survival and cancer progression. It was only a few years after my return to Israel that I became interested in degradation of the ECM' HS as a mean to understand better how tumor cells enter and exit blood vessels in the process of cancer metastasis. I decided to focus on HS knowing that this polyanionic polysaccharide binds to other constituents of the ECM and plays an important role in assembling and stabilizing the entire supramolecular structure of the ECM. It was then that I became interested in the heparanase enzyme, a topic that kept me busy since then. Our first papers on heparanase and cancer metastasis were published in 1983 [152] , in parallel to studies reported by Dr. Nicolson et al. [44] . Next, we reported on the sequential mode of heparanase action in degrading the ECM [46] , its inhibition by species of heparin [51, 153] and expression by platelets [154] , neutrophils [155] and activated cells of the immune system. An important concept was brought about in studies performed during a sabbatical with Michael Klagsbrun and the late Judah Folkman (Harvard Medical Center) revealing that HS in the ECM provides a storage depot for FGF2, and hence heparanase regulates its bioavailability [16, 49, 50] . The concept of ECM as a reservoir for bioactive molecules became well recognized and is of prime importance to the current appreciation of the tumor microenvironment and its significance in cancer progression and treatment.",

            "text": "These and other studies further emphasized the need to purify the heparanase protein and clone the respective gene, an objective that took a long time and was finally achieved at 1999 [4] and published back to back with a study performed by the group of Cristopher Parish in Canberra [1] . Gene cloning enabled studies on the modes of heparanase gene regulation, cellular uptake, lysosomal storage and activa-tion [31, 34, 144, 156, 157] . We and others further revealed the modes of heparanase action in eliciting angiogenesis, tumorigenesis and signal transduction. Thus, 20 years following its cloning, the functional repertoire of heparanase and the complexity of the system are still being revealed. From activity mainly implicated in cell invasion associated with tumor metastasis, heparanase has turned into a multifaceted protein that appears to participate in essentially all major aspects of tumor progression and in the pathogenesis of other diseases. Importantly, the crystal structure of the heparanase protein was resolved [87] , paving the way for rational design and optimization of site-directed heparanase-inhibiting small molecules and monoclonal antibodies. As a direct result of these and subsequent studies performed by other groups and us, heparanase was advanced from being an obscure enzyme with a poorly understood function to a highly promising, novel drug target, offering new treatment strategies for various cancers and other diseases (i.e., chronic inflammation, diabetic nephropathy). The significance of heparanase as a valid target for anti-cancer drug development was reinforced by studies indicating a marked inhibition of human myeloma, lymphoma, glioma, sarcoma, mesothelioma and pancreatic tumor growth in mice treated with heparin-like heparanase-inhibiting compounds (i.e., SST0001 = Roneparstat, PG545 = Pixatimod) that are being examined in clinical trials alone and in combination with other drugs [159, 160] . Unfortunately, we are not yet there raising the question/dilemma if it was wise to focus and invest so much time, energy and effort in the study of a single molecule. Do we really understand the mode of heparanase action in tumorigenesis?; Should we adopt another way of thinking?; Should we focus on other diseases?; Where we objective and unbiased in our interpretations of the results?; What mistakes, if any, were done along the way?; Should the final goal of a basic scientist is to translate his findings into a drug?; Was it worth? etc. (see also Ilan et al., Chap. 9 in this volume). Obviously, there are no simple and clear cut answers. Focusing on one molecule is risky and, nowadays in the era of 'big science', is regarded as an 'old fashion' approach. Yet, the heparanase journey is actively ongoing and should be evaluated in the broad context of cell interaction with the ECM and tumor microenvironment. In fact, heparanase research markedly reinforced the significance of the ECM in the control of cell proliferation and differentiation [149] [150] [151] [152] . It led to important and often unexpected observations in diverse normal and pathological processes including, wound healing, angiogenesis [63] , autophagy [98] , signal transduction [107, 156, 161] , protein trafficking [162] , lysosomal secretion [144, 163] , blood coagulation [92, 164] , epithelial-mesenchymal transition [165] , activation of immune cells [21, [121] [122] [123] , exosome formation [99, 100, 102] , drug resistance [34, 166] , gene transcription [35, 104] and others. While most studies emphasize the involvement of heparanase in cancer progression, other pathologies were investigated. Among these are diabetes [35, 131] , diabetic complications (i.e., diabetic nephropathy, diabetic cardiomyopathy) [132, 136, 167] , kidney dysfunction [38] , fibrosis [134, 168] , inflammatory disorders (i.e., neuroinflammation, pancreatitis, ulcerative colitis, arthritis, sepsis) [121, 140, 169, 170] , amyloidosis [138] , atherosclerosis [39, 40, 171] and others. Interestingly, heparanase accomplishes all these by exerting both enzymatic and non-enzymatic functions that are mostly HS-dependent yet in some cases are HS-independent [172] . In comparison with other ECM degrading enzymes (i.e., MMPs, cathepsins) [173, 174] the heparanase field is small, leaving enough room for other research groups to join and make significant contributions to basic and translational aspects. For example, little is known about a putative non-HS heparanase receptor [107, [175] [176] [177] [178] that binds the enzyme and mediates its downstream signaling function. Likewise, in-depth research is needed to elucidate better the mode of heparanase nuclear translocation and transcriptional activity [104, 105] , as well as its ability to activate macrophages and mediate their polarization [121] [122] [123] [124] . An open area, not referred to in this review, has to do with heparanase-2 (Hpa2), a heparanase homolog devoid of heparanase enzymatic activity [146, 147, 178] . Of particular interest is to resolve the crystal structure of Hpa2, elucidate its mode of action as a tumor suppressor and reveal the significance of its crosstalk with heparanase [144] . Of prime importance from a translational point of view, is to apply the crystal structure of heparanase for rational design of heparanase-inhibiting small molecules, neutralizing monoclonal antibodies and HS-mimicking compounds endowed with good pharmacokinetics and examine their efficiency in animal models and cancer patients.",

Antitumor Efficacy of the Heparanase Inhibitor SST0001 Alone and in Combination with Antiangiogenic Agents in the Treatment of Human Pediatric Sarcoma Models The present study focuses on the effect of SST0001 in a panel of pediatric sarcoma models, representative of various tumor histotypes (soft tissue and bone sarcomas). SST0001 treatment downregulated several angiogenic factors in the conditioned media of sarcoma cells, inhibited the pro-invasive effect of heparin-binding factors (VEGF, bFGF, HGF, PDGF), and abrogated PDGF receptor tyrosine phosphorylation. Subcutaneous administration of SST0001 was very effective, resulting in a significant growth inhibition (range, 64-95%) of all tested tumor xenografts. The efficacy of SST0001 was enhanced in combination with antiangiogenic agents (bevacizumab, sunitinib) as documented by the high rate of complete response. The synergistic effect of SST0001 in combination with antiangiogenic agents is consistent with the heparanase mode of action and with the relevant role of heparin-binding proangiogenic/growth factors in the malignant behavior of sarcoma cells [119]. * See Chapter 15 by Cassinelly & Lanzi for more information on heparanase in sarcomas.",

A single s.c. dose of M402 effectively inhibited seeding of B16F10 murine melanoma cells to the lung in an experimental metastasis model. Fluorescentlabeled M402 demonstrated selective accumulation in the primary tumor.Immunohistological analyses of the primary tumor revealed a decrease in microvessel density in M402 treated animals. M402 treatment also normalized circulating levels of myeloid derived suppressor cells in tumor bearing mice. Chronic administration of M402, alone or in combination with cisplatin or docetaxel, inhibited spontaneous metastasis and prolonged survival in an orthotopic 4 T1 murine mammary carcinoma model[112]. *",

            "text": "Is a Host Enzyme Required for Herpes Simplex Virus-1 Release from Cells Herpesviruses exemplified by herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) attach to cell surface HS for entry into host cells. However, during a productive infection, the HS moieties on parent cells can trap newly exiting viral progenies and inhibit their release. Here we demonstrate that a HS-degrading enzyme of the host, heparanase (HPSE), is upregulated through NF-kB and translocated to the cell surface upon HSV-1 infection for the removal of HS to facilitate viral release. We also find a significant increase in HPSE release in vivo during infection of murine corneas and that knockdown of HPSE in vivo inhibits virus shedding. Overall, we propose that HPSE acts as a molecular switch for turning a virus-permissive 'attachment mode' of host cells to a virus-deterring 'detachment mode'. Since many human viruses use HS as an attachment receptor, the HPSE-HS interplay may delineate a common mechanism for virus release[142]. * See Chapter 32 by Agelidis & Shukla, for more information on heparanase and viral infection.Note added in Proofs: Given that many human viruses use HS as an attachment receptor, non-anticoagulant heparin/HS mimicking compounds (i.e., Roneparstat) may compete with HS and thereby inhibit viral infection. This may be relevant to the recent coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic as HS has been found to function as adhesion molecule that increases the virus density on the cell surface, possibly facilitating the interaction between the virus (HCoV-NL63) and its receptor[143].",
