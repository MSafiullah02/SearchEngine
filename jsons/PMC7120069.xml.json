Kessler, M.D., former FDA commissioner [1]. Screening donated blood for infectious diseases that can be transmitted through blood transfusion is a very important step in ensuring safety. The United States has the safest blood supply in the world [1], and the FDA is striving to keep it safe by decreasing the risk of infectious disease transmission. The regulatory agency is continuously updating its requirements and standards for collecting and processing blood. As mentioned earlier, an important step in ensuring safety is the screening of donated blood for infectious diseases [2, 3]. In the United States, tests for infectious diseases are routinely conducted on each unit of donated blood, and these tests are designed to comply with regulatory requirements (Table 1). The field of clinical microbiology and virology is now focusing on molecular technology. Currently, nucleic acid testing techniques have been developed to screen blood and plasma products for evidence of very recent viral infections that could be missed by conventional serologic tests [2]. It is time for all blood safety procedures to include molecular detection techniques [3]. This approach can significantly aid in blood safety to reduce the risk of transmission of serious disease by transfusion. This chapter will review and update the current antigen/antibody-based technology, molecular biological technology, and published regulatory policy data for blood safety.",

For direct detection of virus antigens, shortly after virus infection, only a few viruses release antigens in amounts sufficiently detectable in the body by an antibody-mediated assay. For indirect virus detection by virus-specific antibodies [e.g., an immunofluorescence assay or enzyme immunoassay (EIA), etc.], there is a problem in that shortly after infection by a pathogenic virus, and there is a window period in which antibody generation is insufficient for detection [4]. To reduce this window period of low detection, direct nucleic acid tests are needed.",

The nucleic acid tests can also provide evidence for genetic variation in viruses. Molecular methods include the use of nucleic acid probes as well as amplification-based and DNA sequence-based techniques. An increasing number of molecular diagnostic methods are now available commercially [2]. In comparison to classical methods, molecular biological methods are superior in terms of rapidness, specificity, and sensitivity. The current nucleic acid detection methods in the field may be grouped into two major classes: amplifying techniques such as PCR and non-amplifying techniques such as Southern blot hybridization. Amplifying techniques are more sensitive than non-amplifying techniques. There are two different types of amplifying methods [5], target amplification methods and signal amplification methods. Target amplifying techniques include PCR, nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (NASBA) [6, 7], self-sustaining sequence amplification (3SR), transcription-based amplification (TAS), transcription-mediated amplification (TMA), strand displacement amplification (SDA), and ligase chain reaction (LCR). Signal amplification methods include branched DNA signal amplification (bDNA) [8], cleavage-based signal amplification (cycling probe technologies and invader assay), Q\u00df replicase, hybrid capture, cycling probe technologies (CPT), and rolling-circle amplification (RCA) [9]. To further insure the safety of blood products, it is of importance to further improve these and other types of nucleic acid testing [2\u20135].",

This technique is used to detect specific sequences within mixtures of DNA, which is size fractionated by gel electrophoresis and then transferred by capillary action to a suitable membrane. After blocking of non-specific binding sites, the nitrocellulose replica of the original gel electrophoresis experiment is then allowed to hybridize with an oligonucleotide probe representing the specific DNA sequence of interest. Should specific DNA be present on the blot, it will combine with the labeled probe and be detectable. By coelectrophoresing DNA fragments of known molecular weight, the size(s) of the hybridizing band(s) can then be determined. Southern blotting hybridization technology is one of the major tools that have already helped clinical staffs worldwide interpret genomic information. Other competing methodologies include in situ hybridization and solution hybridization. Important clinical examples of the use of this technology are DNA fingerprinting and the ability to detect DNA gene rearrangements.",

            "text": "In 1983, Dr. Kary Mullis at Cetus Corporation conceived of polymerase chain reaction [11]. There is not a single technique that has had a greater impact on the practice of molecular biology than PCR. With this technique, we can detect infectious disease agents at an extremely low level. It is based on the ability of sense and antisense DNA primers to hybridize to a DNA of interest. Following extension from the primers on the DNA template by DNA polymerase, the reaction is heat denatured and allowed to anneal with the primers once again. Another round of extension leads to a multiplicative increase in DNA products. Therefore, a minute amount of DNA can be efficiently amplified in an exponential fashion to result in larger amounts of DNA that are more easily manipulated. By including critical controls, the technique can be made quantitative. The current level of the sensitivity and detection limit is as low as 10\u201350 copies per ml blood in HIV testing [1, 12, 13]. Important clinical examples of the use of PCR are detection of HIV and HCV [14\u201316]. PCR techniques have evolved into different branches. Some of them are now widely in use for virus detection in clinical diagnostics. These are real-time PCR by TaqMan (Roche), LightCycler (Roche), Smartcycler (Cepheid), in situ PCR, nested PCR, nested real-time PCR [17], broad-range PCR, multiplex PCR, RT-PCR, arbitrarily primer PCR, long PCR, and quantitative PCR. Real-time sequence technology will be coming soon for more detailed detection. In the past, identification of viral serotypes was restricted to investigative methods using antibody detection and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP). With real-time sequence technology, we will be able to detect a virus early as well as to obtain the viral sequence.",

It promises to be a fast and accurate diagnostic tool in the field of clinical microbiology and virology. Applied to infection safety for blood and blood products, it will be able to screen for the presence of viral pathogens by matching genetic sequences. Compared with existing technologies, it allows for a wider variety of specific tests to be carried out simultaneously to determine the quality of the blood and will provide consumers with extra safety. With the use of molecular biology protocols, the microarray will permit the detection of lower concentrations of microorganisms in the blood and the accurate identification of many types of pathogenic contaminants. In the near future, progress can be expected in the application of microarray technology for screening of donated blood for infectious agents. It can provide vast information about the identity of blood-borne pathogens as well as their gene expression profiles [19].",

The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that 2 billion people worldwide have been infected with HBV and 350,000,000 people are chronically infected. Chronic infection results in a high risk for liver cancer and cirrhosis of the liver, which cause about 1000,000 deaths each year. Each year up to 200,000 people become newly infected in the United States alone. Since screening for HBV began in 1969, the rate of infection through blood transfusions has greatly decreased. However, as of 2000, HBV is still transmitted through blood transfusions in 1 out of 137,000 units of blood. One reason for this is that currently available blood screening technologies detect core antibodies or surface antigens, which appear up to 8 weeks after infection. Serologic tests for hepatitis B virus include hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and hepatitis B core antibody (HBcAb).",

The HBsAg test detects the outer envelope, identifying an individual infected with the hepatitis B virus. This virus can cause inflammation of the liver, and in the earliest stage of the disease, infected people may feel ill or even have yellow discoloration of the skin or eyes, a condition known as jaundice. Fortunately, most patients recover completely and test negative for HBsAg within a few months after the illness. A small percentage of people become chronic carriers of the virus, and in these cases, the test may remain positive for years. Chronically infected people can develop severe liver disease as time passes and need to be followed carefully by an experienced physician. To reduce the occurrence of posttransfusion hepatitis, it is essential to screen all blood donations for hepatitis B surface antigen by the most sensitive and specific assays. Blood donations that are found to be reactive in the HBsAg test are automatically confirmed by the HBsAg confirmatory assay. If the specimen is neutralizable in the confirmatory test, the specimen is considered positive for HBsAg. Hepatitis B surface antigen testing of donated blood has begun in 1975 (Table 1).",

Detection of early HBV infection of blood donors is still a major problem of blood transfusion. The current third-generation licensed HBsAg tests (mostly radioimmunoassay and enzyme immunoassays) cannot detect HBV in the window period for HBV infection. This is a strong motivation for introducing molecular detection techniques to the field [23]. There are some commercially available test methods for detecting HBV DNA in the market now, such as Chiron\u2019s Quantiplex HBV DNA [24], Digene\u2019s Hybrid Capture, Abbott\u2019s HBV DNA assay, and Roche\u2019s Amplicor HBV Monitor. Using these commercial hybridization or PCR-based assays, HBV DNA can be detected 1\u20133 weeks before the appearance of HBsAg [25]. Some chronically infected patients who have lost their HBsAg remain HBV DNA positive but are disqualified as potential blood donors. Molecular detection of HBV DNA is more sensitive than current methods employed for HBsAg screening [22\u201325].",

            "text": "The hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a member of the Flaviviridae family of viruses, which are associated with both human and animal diseases [27]. Hepatitis caused by HCV is the most common chronic blood-borne infection in the United States. Over 4 million Americans are believed to be infected. HCV can also be transmitted through blood transfusion. HCV causes inflammation of the liver, and up to 80% of those exposed to the virus develop a chronic infection, which can lead to liver inflammation, cirrhosis, cancer, and death. Eventually, up to 20% of people with HCV may develop cirrhosis of the liver or other severe liver diseases. As in other forms of hepatitis, individuals may be infected with the virus, but may not realize they are carriers since they do not have any symptoms. Because of the risk of serious illness, people with HCV need to be followed closely by a physician with experience evaluating this infection. Since the full-length HCV cDNA was first cloned in 1989, significant progress has been made in characterizing its molecular biology [13]. But, the natural history of HCV infection is still evolving, and current treatment options for patients are either limited or expensive [27]. There is no vaccine for HCV, and the current treatment includes a combination of alpha interferon and ribavirin as well as the combination of the nucleotide polymerase inhibitor sofosbuvir and the NS5A inhibitor velpatasvir [28]. Although the former is efficacious in only a minority of patients [29], the latter has been shown to be effective in a broad range of patients [28]. The life cycle of the HCV continues to be poorly understood due to the lack of an efficient cell culture system [30]. There is an urgent need to develop a highly sensitive detection method for studying possible extrahepatic sites for the replication of hepatitis C virus. We recently established a cell culture system for the replication of HCV by using human T and B leukemia cell lines [31]. This model should represent a valuable tool for the detailed study of the initial steps of the HCV replication cycle and for the evaluation of evolving antiviral molecules. Currently, appropriate vaccine strategies for HCV have not been developed. Early detection and prevention of HCV infection are most important for blood safety.",

High-sensitivity detection of HCV during the window period is a long-term technical challenge in the field. Tests for HCV RNA genome detection based on the PCR or other highly sensitive RNA detection systems have been used for the diagnosis of acute hepatitis [26]. Sensitive detection of HCV RNA based on RT-PCR or other nucleic acid amplification techniques can be readily accomplished with kits that are now available commercially. For example, in 1999 the FDA-approved Roche\u2019s Amplicor HIV-1 Monitor ultrasensitive quantitative assay. It can measure HIV levels at as few as 50 copies/ml, and another commercial kit, the LCx HIV RNA quantitative assay from Abbott Laboratories, also has a detection limit at 50 copies/ml. Some studies even showed a sensitivity limit at one copy [33]. In fact, a qualitative assay should be much more sensitive than a quantitative assay for HIV/HCV screening. A sensitive qualitative HCV molecular detection assay will possibly interdict and virtually prevent all transfusion-associated HIV/HCV. The current sensitivity standard for clinical diagnostics is 100 copies per ml, but since there has been an improvement in technology, this would be the time to change sensitivity standard to 50 copies per ml.",

In 2002, WNV was identified as transfusion transmissible. It is transmitted by mosquitoes to birds and other animals through a mosquito bite. The virus can infect people, horses, many types of birds, and some other animals. WNV was shown in 2002 to be transmissible by blood [35], with an estimated mean risk of 2/10,000\u20135/10,000 in outbreak regions in the United States. The most common symptoms of transfusion-transmitted cases of WNV were fever and headache. Detection of WNV includes either a measurement of WNV antibodies or of WNV nucleic acid (detecting genetic material from the virus itself). There are two types of WNV antibody testing: IgM and IgG. In most individuals, IgM antibodies will be present within 8 days after the initial exposure to WNV, followed by IgG production several weeks later. But, the antibodies tested to detect WNV are not expedient for donor blood screening. Nucleic acid testing involves amplifying and measuring the West Nile virus\u2019s genetic material to detect the presence of the virus in the blood or tissue. WNV NAT will be negative in the blood once clinical illness has occurred. In this situation, both NAT and IgM antibody testing may be needed. Nucleic acid tests to screen blood for WNV are commercially available and in current use. But, the viral yield for WNV infection is much lower than other viruses. Consequently, a more sensitive WNV NAT system for donor blood screening will be required, which could further reduce the risks of transfusion-transmitted WNV.",

Any unit found positive should be discarded as per standard safety procedures. This test is done to detect evidence of infection with the spirochete that causes syphilis. Blood centers began testing for this shortly after World War II, when syphilis rates in the general population were much higher. The risk of transmitting syphilis through a blood transfusion is exceedingly small (no cases have been recognized in this country for many years) because the infection is very rare in blood donors and because the spirochete is fragile and unlikely to survive blood storage conditions. Sensitivity and specificity of serologic tests vary depending on the type of test performed and the stage of the disease. If the donor has spirochetemia, their serologic tests are usually negative, and if the donors are antibody positive, their blood is not infectious. Syphilis serological tests for donors have less clinical significance. A nucleic acid test for accurately detecting syphilis is needed. It can be used to determine whether a blood donor is currently or has recently been infected with the spirochete.",

It has different clinical and pathologic characteristics from classic CJD. Each disease also has a particular genetic profile of the prion protein gene [51]. In recent years, questions have been raised concerning the potential risk of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease for recipients of plasma-derived clotting factors, including the United States licensed factor VIII (pdFVIII), factor IX (pdFIX), and other plasma-derived products such as immune globulins and albumin. In the past 10 years, there have been some reported cases of probable variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) transmission by red blood cell transfusions in the United Kingdom [52]. Prion infections are associated with long and clinically silent incubations [50, 51]. The number of asymptomatic individuals with vCJD prion infection is unknown, posing risk to others through blood transfusion, blood products, organ or tissue grafts, and contaminated medical instruments. In order to decrease the risk, there is a need to establish a blood-based molecular assay for detection of vCJD prion infection [52].

Babesia infection can also be acquired by blood transfusion [64, 65]. In fact, there have been many cases of transfusion-induced babesiosis documented [64, 65]. Risk of developing this clinical infection is increased for elderly, asplenic, or immunosuppressed patients. Current standards issued by the American Association of Blood Banks (AABB) require the indefinite deferral of a blood donor with a history of babesiosis [65]. There is a need to develop methods for identification Babesia microti in order to reduce the risk of transmission of babesiosis by transfusion. Diagnosis depends upon finding parasites on blood film examination which can be detected 2\u20134 weeks after a tick bite. Hamster inoculation and serology have also been used for diagnosis. The indirect fluorescent antibody test (IFAT) is available for B. microti and is the most useful serological test for early diagnosis [66].

Chagas disease is spread mainly by blood-sucking insects infected with Trypanosoma cruzi. Chagas disease can also be spread through blood transfusion, organ transplants, and from a mother to an unborn child. National screening of the blood supply [69] was instituted in early 2007 by FDA, and more than 1000 donors with T. cruzi infection have been identified within the past 3 years of testing. \u201cScreening for T. cruzi is an important safety measure to help protect our blood supply and to help prevent the spread of Chagas disease,\u201d says Karen Midthun, M.D., acting director of the FDA\u2019s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research. Currently, serological ELISA tests are available to diagnose chronic Chagas disease [70]. PCR test is not a tool for diagnosis of chronic Chagas disease in clinical practice yet, although some research results have showed that PCR is a very sensitive parasitological test for Chagas disease in active transmission regions [71]. More studies are needed for the development of this molecular method.",

Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a newly recognized coronavirus whose genome sequence does not belong to any of the known coronavirus groups and which quickly spread all over the world from Asia in 2003. There has been no evidence that this infection is transmitted from blood donors to transfusion recipients, but the virus associated with SARS is present in the blood of people who are sick, and it is possible that the virus could be present in the blood immediately before a person gets sick, so that an individual with infection but no symptoms possibly could transmit SARS through a blood donation. To help determine whether or not an individual might be infected with SARS, a blood collection facility will ask a potential donor orally or in writing about any travel to a SARS-affected country or a history of SARS or possible exposure to SARS. Enzyme-linked immunoassays for detection of specific IgG and IgM antibodies and RT-PCR for detection of SARS coronavirus-specific RNA in the SARS patients have been developed. Rapid, sensitive, and specific identification of SARS and other novel coronaviruses by molecular methods will be very important in the future.",

It is still possible that unexplained cases of posttransfusion hepatitis may be caused by a new, undiscovered pathogen. In recent years, numerous new infectious agents found worldwide have been identified through time-consuming procedures. By the time a new virus, such as HCV, HIV, and SARS, is found, many people are infected, and there could be a large number of fatalities. There is an urgent need to develop methods for rapid identification and characterization of previously unknown pathogenic viruses. The most recent technologies for detecting and identifying previously unrecognized pathogens are expression library screening, representational difference analysis (RDA), and broad-range polymerase chain reaction (BR-PCR). But they are all time-consuming approaches. The new unrecognized and uncharacterized viral agents can be rapidly identified by some of the new molecular approaches, e.g., subtraction hybridization [74] and DNA microarray.",

The high safety level of the blood supply is the result of continued improvements in blood donor screening and testing. It will be achieved by introducing more updated nucleic acid tests to the field of blood safety [2, 3]. Nucleic acid testing is a method of testing blood that is more sensitive and specific than conventional tests that require the presence of antibodies to trigger a positive test result. Also, NAT works by detecting the low levels of viral genetic material present when an infection occurs but before the body develops an immune response to a virus. This improved sensitivity should enable us to significantly decrease the infection window period, allowing for earlier detection of the infection and diminishing the chances for transmission of the agent via transfusion. We are not only to protect the blood supply from known pathogens but also the emergence of new and unrecognized and uncharacterized infectious agents [4, 36, 37, 75]. The NAT methods are more sensitive and specific compared with non-NAT. In the future, NAT technology, such as PCR, may allow routine screening of donors for all the known and unknown pathogens of concern to blood safety.",
