Hence, quality control, discovery of active constituents in them, and proof of the efficacies have long been regarded as hard difficulties and very challenging tasks to scientists [1], [2], [3], [4]. They have been the main drawbacks in the internationalization and globalization of HMs. In China, the governmental sectors have proposed a series of policies and measures on how to tackle these problems in recent years. The first and urgent job is to make HMs meet the globally acceptable criteria.",

Consequently, education, training and research in this area have not been accorded due attention and support. The quantity and quality of the safety and efficacy data on traditional medicine are far from sufficient to meet the criteria needed to support its use worldwide. The reasons for the lack of research data are due to not only to health care policies, but also to a lack of adequate or accepted research methodology for evaluating traditional medicine.\u201d[5]. Chromatographic fingerprint, a characteristic representation of the chemical components in HMs, some of which are pharmacologically active, has been developed to control and evaluate the quality of HMs. It is an acceptable technique both in theory and practice [1], [3]. For example, Li et al. proposed local least square (LSS) and principal component analysis (PCA) to deal with the data sets of fingerprints, and further for quality evaluation of HMs with chromatographic profiles [6]. Gong et al. employed an effective definition in information theory, entropy, to assess the fingerprints obtained from chemical analysis of HMs [4]. It can be widely used to know chromatographic separation, determine the optimized analytical conditions, and so on. Yi et al. combined fingerprint technique with multivariate statistical analysis to discriminate the two kinds of HMs of Pericarpium Citri Reticulatae and Pericarpium Citri Reticulatae Viride [7]. In China, all finished injection products of HMs are forced to meet the state standards of fingerprints in very near future.",

            "text": "In terms of most reported studies on HMs, including the works in chemical analysis and fingerprint, it can be found that one of the important steps for quality control of HMs is extraction and discovery of the integrated information, as well as the sameness and difference of compositions hidden in large number of data sets, the same as processing of strong overlapping chromatographic profiles from high-throughput data in metabonomics [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17]. However, how to get such rich information buried in complex data obtained from the modern hyphenated instruments like GC\u2013MS with no lost of too much time and labor? Most conventional approaches can only help to certain extent because they cannot provide a clear picture of the studied systems with the main components unknown, which may or may not have synergic effects with one another. Many chemometric tools, including PCA [18], EFA [19], [20], HELP [21], [22], [23], SFA [24], [25], AMWFA [14], [16], [17], and so on, showed powerful abilities to find the information from coupled instruments and chromatographic fingerprints with the help of mathematics, statistics and computer science. These methods have been widely used in the analysis of HMs such as Rhizoma Atractylodis, Pericarpium Citri Reticulatae, Cortex Magnoliae Officinalis, Radix Glycyrrhizae, Cordyceps sinensis, drug pair Rhizoma Ligustici Chuanxiong-Radix Paeoniae Rubra (RLC-RPR), Chenpi of orange, and others [14], [16], [17], [26], [27]. But most of them only attempted to find the information of pure components of HMs, not regard them as a whole, like what they actually done on disease treatment. This makes full understanding of the \u201csynergic effects\u201d of multi-component be a difficulty both in the investigation of HMs and metabonomics. Moreover, the requirements of rapid, accurate, and online analysis in industry further challenge the scientists on the study of analytical chemistry and HMs [28], [29]. At the same time, some necessary but time-consuming data pretreatment procedures also burden the analysis of gas chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry (GC\u2013MS) data acquired at the studies in these fields. For instance, alignment of chromatographic fingerprints or metabolite profilings is one of the common and unavoidable steps before continuing the next research like data comparison, discrimination analysis, and so on [30], [31], [32]. Nevertheless, how to do alignment of high-throughput data automatically, even semi-automatically with no consumption of too much time, and strong intervention of the users is still under investigation [33], [34], [35]. Furthermore, other procedures for data processing, including remove of instrumental background, filtering of homoscedastic and/or heteroscedastic noises, signal smoothing, normalization and pattern recognition also significantly influence the elucidation of the action mechanisms and \u201csynergic effects\u201d of bioactive ingredients in HMs [1], [2], [21], [22], [23]. It is not difficult to see that data processing of high-throughput data are very challengeable only with less costs. Some interesting works have been reported on the investigations of HMs, metabonomics, and others with effective data processing strategies [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24], [25], [26], [27], [36], [37]. Metabolite profiling/footprinting of metabonomics is always very complicated containing hundreds, or more small molecules [38], [39]. It is very similar to the study of HMs on data processing.",

With the mass spectral profiling at hand, the chromatographic profiles with the contribution of one or more interested components at certain mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) points can be used for data interpretations from the mass spectral direction. It is powerful in the analysis of high-throughput data obtained in the studies of HMs and metabonomics. Such strategy can make full use of the rich data information of hyphenated chromatographic instruments like GC\u2013MS. It will be very useful for quality control of HMs, as well as discovery of biomarkers or biomarker patterns, and pharmacological and toxicological studies. A commonly used herbal medicine, Houttuynia cordata Thunb and its finished injection products analyzed by GC\u2013MS are employed to deliver the advantages, strategies and good performance of mass spectral profiling in the analysis of mixture samples with high complexity.",

            "text": "According to the statements described above, the ith row of data set X, namely, the mass spectral profiling, may be a pure or mixed contribution of only one or more interested compositions. If the m/z point of a certain mass spectral profiling is a selective one, in another word, the response produced by only one component, the mass chromatogram (MC) at this m/z point can be used to get the pure chromatographic profile of the target component. Also, its pure spectrum can then be computed by least square method. This has great significance both to qualitative and quantitative analysis of multi-component, as in quality control of HMs. In Fig. 1(a), the pure chromatographic profile can be extracted if the corresponding position of 58 in (c) is a selective m/z point. In the last decades, some chemometric resolution methods and selected ion monitoring-mass spectroscopy (SIM-MS) were developed for analysis of components embedded in overlapping peak clusters of complex mixtures based on the selective mass spectral information [40], [41], [42]. Wang et al. attempted to get the selective m/z point of GC\u2013MS data using chemometric methods [40]. This kind of methods even proposed the strategies for the resolution of mixture systems with embedded overlapping components, in which some minor components are completely buried by a big one. But most of mass spectral profilings are total contribution of more than one component, as shown in Fig. 1(b) and (d). In Fig. 1(d), if the m/z point at 72 of mass spectral profiling is not a selective one, the MC at this position will be an overlapping peak cluster with several components, as Fig. 1(b) shows. In this case, the common m/z points and their abundance become effective indices to determine the importance of different components for disease treatment, and further used for quality control of HMs. They include quantitative information of the same type of chemical components, or interested in. Generally, the m/z points of mass spectral profiling are very abundant for the extraction of components information in complex mixtures. In most cases, it is not so difficult to find the interested m/z points from the mass spectral profiling to represent common contribution of more than one target components. Therefore, the researchers can employ these rich m/z points to discover the common qualitative information and quantitative variation rules of the chromatographic components. It will be very helpful in the evaluation of activities of constituents, and then quality control of HMs. For instance, the efficacies of HMs in treating diseases are mostly \u201csynergic effects\u201d of a few active ingredients. If one can find one or more common m/z points at mass spectral profiling of these components, the curative effects of HMs can probably be predicted using their abundance before pharmacological experiments. These m/z points and their intensities can also be used in modeling between the active constitutes and their activities. It is also easy to see they are informative variables collecting material information of the components. This will help to save much time, money and labor in analysis. So, mass spectral profiling is a very useful reference index to assess the curative effects of HMs. In contrast to the traditional chromatographic fingerprint, the possibility to extract the buried information of GC\u2013MS data will be increased probably because of the discontinuity and selectivity of mass spectra (MS). There is more information included at different m/z points, which can be employed for analysis in detail. Similarity index among vectors, such as mass spectral profilings and chromatographic fingerprints, was used to partially assess their advantages and disadvantages in this work. It is defined as the following equation:(2)SI=xT\u22c5ynorm(x)\u22c5norm(y)where denotation SI means the similarity. The symbol \u201c\u00b7\u201d represents dot product of two vectors of chromatographic profiles x and y, and \u201cnorm\u201d is the operation of vector norm.",

In most cases, it is also very helpful to know what components, at least what kinds of components presenting in a target system like HMs. (2) In general, several metabolites with similar molecular structures always contribute to the same m/z points. Therefore, extraction and mining of the positions and abundance of such m/z points will be a very good choice to evaluate the integrated qualitative and quantitative variation of the important target metabolites. (3) Selective m/z points of components are informative and useful to extract the buried knowledge of components in complex mixture samples. Some conventional theoretical and instrumental methods were proposed on the basis of these m/z points. It is one of the main considerations of mass spectral profiling in the analysis of mixtures in contrast to chromatographic profiles (fingerprints). The discovery and extraction of information of selective m/z point of mass spectral profiling is probably a key point to solve the present problems. (4) Data preprocessing of mass spectral profiling is completely easier than chromatographic profiles with only hundreds of data points. In general, the number of points of the former is 400\u20131000, but the latter one more than 10,000, always. Another competitive advantage is no shift of m/z points of mass spectral profiling, unlike the usual shift of retention times in chromatographic profiles. Correction of retention time shift of high-throughput data is still a great difficulty. Most reported methods couldn\u2019t calibrate the shift of large number of chromatographic data automatically, even semi-automatically. (5) The common patterns, i.e., the common features of components in GC\u2013MS data of mixtures can be easily constructed with mass spectral profiling. Furthermore, the researchers can conveniently extract one or more special m/z points of mass spectral profiling or the chromatographic profiles at these positions to further study the components exactly, if necessary. This will make good use of the information of two-way GC\u2013MS data, no losing information as the conventional one-way fingerprint technique. Even it is possible to study the complex mixtures with information only from mass spectrometer without any chromatographic separation. All these operations are timesaving to model analysis of complex systems, such as pattern recognition of HMs collected from different origins, or quality good and fake products. How to differentiate these samples is the main factors in quality control of HMs. Mass spectral profiling can be a promising tool in the analysis of high-throughput mixture systems with very high complexity.",

Then, whether is it possible to determine the products made with fresh and dried medicinal materials? Are there apparent differences between the two kinds of injections? Can the activities be evaluated with the mass spectral profiling of the GC\u2013MS chromatographic data? On June 2006, SFDA prohibited the production, marketing and use of the injection products of Houttuynia cordata Thunb because of the several anaphylactoid and lethiferous cases. That led to nationwide disputation and censure of the widely used herbal medicine. In this investigation, 82 injection samples were studied with GC\u2013MS technique and the proposed tool.

In practice, the evaluation of sameness and difference of components in the same medicine only with different origins are not so easy. Additionally, data processing of these samples, such as correction of retention time shifts, challenges the conventional chemometric methods. Then, it is even difficult to get the relationships of presence and absence of target components among these samples unless to obtain all the components information using the existing chemometric methods. For succinct description purpose, only mean of the total mass spectral profiling (after normalization operation) acquired at the four different areas is shown in Fig. 3\n. Obviously, the four mass spectral profiling is very similar to each other. The similarity of the 34 mass spectral profiling with their mean mass spectral profiling is between 0.8151 and 0.9909. The five minimum similarities also attain to 0.8151, 0.8692, 0.8735, 0.8809 and 0.8828, respectively. Most other similarities are more than 0.9500. So, the common information of mass spectral profiling among different samples, namely, the common features of medicinal materials of Houttuynia cordata Thunb, can be extracted out using mass spectral profiling. Furthermore, the special interested m/z points at mass spectral profiling are very useful to get the chromatographic profiles of components in mixture samples. Such information is very important for quality control of HMs. One can define the intensities of the interested m/z points, or the MC (s) at different m/z points, if necessary. Also, these extracted m/z points and chromatographic profiles are crucial in the study of metabonomics, such as the discovery of biomarkers or biomarker patterns on disease diagnosis. The main advantage of the strategy of mass spectral profiling for quality control of HMs is the effective employment of spectral information of all the components in GC\u2013MS data, including the major and minor ones. It considers the important volatile components in Houttuynia cordata Thunb, such as terpenes and the ramification, and aliphatic compounds as a whole. With the help of the additional information of conventional chromatographic fingerprint, mass spectral profiling will assist one to get the comprehensive and integrated information of components in complex GC\u2013MS data for experimental and industrial applications.",

The total number of samples was 82, which is largely more than the number of the medicinal materials analyzed in the above section. It is really a time-consuming and challengeable task if only the conventional methods are used for alignment of shift of retention times, and then, other treatments. These samples were respectively collected from Zhengqing, Yaan, Lingrui and Ange corporations for HMs production. The front two factories locate in South China using fresh medicinal materials, and the latter two in North China using dried ones. The main task for quality control of such products is how to find the sameness and difference with discrimination analysis techniques, as well as the special interested components. Whether the dried medicinal materials can be used in production is a vexed question in China. In this work, the new technique may do a favor on solution of such problem. The numbers of samples for analysis of the above four factories were respectively, 13, 18, 45 and 6. The four average chromatograms shown in Fig. 4 are mean profiles of the samples extracted from the same manufacturers. From this figure, the main qualitative information of the components between retention time 16 and 21 min is very similar among them. But the difference in some other retention time regions can be found, especially to the third one (manufacturer C). The similarities of the 82 TIC profiles with their mean profiles are from 0.5826 to 0.9377. Most of them are from 0.7 to 0.9. In Fig. 5\n, the clustering results of all the 82 mixture samples using the chromatographic profiles and PCA are shown with the first two principal components, titled PC1 and PC2, respectively. It is apparent to see the discrimination results are not very satisfactory for quality control of the products from the four factories. First, the samples from Nos. 1 to 13 of manufacture A are very dispersed and cannot differentiate from B (from Nos. 14 to 31) and C (from Nos. 32 to 76) very well. The samples of manufacturer D (from Nos. 77 to 82) are nearly mixed together with the samples of manufacturer C. Clustering of the twelfth sample of manufacturers A is false, in fact. The main sameness and difference of the samples produced by fresh and dried medicinal materials cannot be clearly distinguished in the projection loadings plot. Then, the discrimination results are unacceptable used for quality control. On the other hand, the mean of total mass spectral profiling of the four different factories after normalization is shown in Fig. 6\n. Obviously, the main feature of these spectra at different m/z points of mass spectral profiling is very similar to each other. As described above, the chromatographic profiles of the pure and/or mixed components at the m/z points can be further extracted and studied in detail. For example, if one is interested in the m/z point 207 at mass spectral profiling of the second manufacturer B, chromatographic profile of the component at this m/z point can be easily extracted from the original GC\u2013MS data for validation. Then, the efficacies of the products from different factories can be possibly elucidated with mass spectral profiling. The similarities of the 82 mass spectral profiling with their mean profiling are between 0.8854 and 0.9937. Most of them are more than 0.9500. Obviously, the relative intensities of spectra at m/z points 58 and 71 in the manufacturers A and B using fresh medicinal materials are significantly larger than them with dried ones. The main reason is the degradation of some volatile components in the processes of drying, storage and production. The similarities between the samples of manufacturers A and B, C and D are respectively from 0.9113 to 0.9981, and from 0.9231 to 0.9990. Most of them attain to 0.9900. Compared with the similarities obtained from chromatographic fingerprints, mass spectral profilings of the products acquired at the same kinds of medicinal materials (fresh or dried) are more similar than the different kind. After deduction of the mean of mass spectral profiling (see Eq. (3)), the results of all the 82 samples with PCA analysis are shown in Fig. 7\n:(3)xnew=x\u2212mean(x)Here, denotations x, mean(x) and x\nnew, respectively mean the original mass spectral profiling x, mean of x and the new vector after the operation. It is very clear to see that the samples collected from the four different manufacturers can be discriminated with very good performance. The four discrimination regions A1 and A2, B1 and B2 in the figure can be used to divide the samples from different factories into four parts very well. Furthermore, the samples manufactured by fresh (in A1 and A2) and dried medicinal materials (in B1 and B2) also clearly distributed in two different sides. Therefore, mass spectral profiling with the same medicinal materials has more common features. It is crucial for the quality control of HMs.",

The possible pure profiles with only one component are plotted in the first three profiles. At the same time, the molecular structures and pure spectra of the three components A, B and C are shown. The three components are very important bioactive constituents of Houttuynia cordata Thunb. With the help of mass spectral profiling, the qualitative and quantitative information of these components can be obtained at the target m/z points. So, the three compounds are very important for evaluation and improvement of the efficacy of Houttuynia cordata Thunb. Of course, some conventional methods such as EFA [19], [20], HELP [21], [22], [23], and FSMWEFA [43], etc. can be further used for purity test of these components, if necessary. Other six mixed chromatographic profiles with two, three, four and more compsitions are shown from the forth to ninth profiles. It can be found that all the above three components A, B and C are included in the sixth and ninth chromatographic profiles. Therefore, the m/z points with contribution to these profiles are very helpful to provide possible efficacy information of Houttuynia cordata Thunb. All the nine chromatographic profiles in Fig. 8 are obtained from different m/z points. Most of them have more than two target m/z points. Of course, the sum of chromatographic profiles of different m/z points can be used for evaluation when the number of m/z points is more than one to a certain profile. These m/z points of mass spectral profiling are very important reference indices to evaluate the qualitative and quantitative information or the variation rules of the active constituents.

It seems that the relative intensities of manufacturers A and B (with fresh herbs) at the two m/z points are significantly larger than the relative intensities in manufacturers C and D (with dried herbs) in Fig. 6. Then, the chromatographic profiles at these m/z points can be extracted for further study. The relative quantitative information of components a1 and a2 in manufacturers C and D are smaller than the same components a3 and a4 in A and B (at m/z point of 58). The similar results of components b1, b2, b3 and b4 can also be obtained at m/z point 71 to show the quantitative variation rules of these components among different samples. It can be found that the qualitative and quantitative information of components in mass spectral profiling and their m/z points is very rich for the analysis of complex mixture samples. Such information is also useful to elucidate the mechanism of difference of active ingredients among different but related samples like HM products of different manufacturers. Mass spectral profiling of GC\u2013MS is a powerful tool to further understand the integrated structures of contaminated mass spectral data and their corresponding chromatographic profiles of chemical components. It can be an effective strategy in the study of HMs, as well as metabonomics and system biology.",

Most useful information buried in the contaminated data sets can be mined out in a simple and convenient way. The study of Houttuynia cordata Thunb is a good example used in this work. No requirement of correction of shift of retention times among chromatographic profiles with a great deal of data points, the dried and fresh medicinal materials collected from different origins, as well as the final injection products from four manufacturers, were discriminated with good performance. Up to the present, information extraction of high-throughput data obtained from hyphenated instruments like GC\u2013MS is one of the main procedures with great challenges in the study of HMs, and other complicated mixture systems. Mass spectral profiling can be a possible tool to resolve the problems in these scientific fields. It can be an effective and necessary supplement to the conventional techniques. This tool is also a good choice on data processing in the study of metabonomics and biomarker discovery.",
