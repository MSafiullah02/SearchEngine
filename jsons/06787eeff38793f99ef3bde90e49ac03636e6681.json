Plants from six distinct vegetation zones below such a cliff at 79\u00b0 N, Svalbard, Norway, were collected for analysis under greenhouse conditions. Leaf nitrate reductase activity (NRA) was analysed in 42 species representing 25 % of the Svalbard vascular flora. The species mean NRA values ranged from 0.37 to 8.34 \u00b5mols of nitrite ions formed per gram of plant fresh weight per hour. Species in the vegetated zone growing closest to recent guano deposits had the highest NRA values, (mean = 4.47) whereas plants growing farther below the cliff had significantly lower values (mean = 0.55).",

This gradient paralleled the steep soil nitrate gradient, which decreased from 13.84 mg/l at the cliffbase to 1.03 mg/l downslope. Correspondingly, soil ammonium ions in the vegetation zones ranged between 1.96 mg/l at the cliff-base to 0.03 mg/l downslope.

Nitrogen constitutes as much as 6 % of the total dry weight in some plants (Lee & Stewart 1978) and is essential for all activities of living cells, including the synthesis of organic compounds such as aminoacids, proteins, and nucleic acids. Although in a few cases NH 4 + provides the exclusive form of available soil N , in some soils NO 3is the predominant form available for uptake. The capacity for NO 3 reduction in plants is therefore a prerequisite for, and an indication of, the optimal utilization of the natural N supply. Of the enzymes participating in reduction, nitrate reductase (NR) determines the rate of the reaction as a whole (Beevers & Hageman 1969) . Occurrence and activity of NR are therefore of considerable ecological interest.",

Large colonies of migratory birds transport nitrogen from sea to land during cliff-nesting activities in the spring and summer. The ornithogenic soils associated with these nesting sites receive seasonal flushes of nutrients during snowmelt-runoff. Later in the season rainfall redistributes these deposits of rich organic material to maintain a typical steep nitrogen gradient characterized by high levels at the cliff-base and lower concentrations downslope. Distinct identifiable zones of lush vegetation are present along this rich nitrogen gradient, and are best developed on the south-facing slopes where net solar radiation is highest.",

The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between the distribution of plant species in bird cliff vegetation and the amount of soil nitrate available in the region of sea-bird guano deposition. The species' capacity to synthesize NR may be a key factor for plant survival and distribution along the vegetation zonation. To test this hypothesis, constitutive NRA analyses were conducted on plants collected in their natural soils and transported to a controlled greenhouse environment. At the same time, induction capacity of the nitrate assimilating enzyme was investigated in a nitrate applicationfertilization experiment conducted on a subset of the collected plants. Field investigations of NR activity have been conducted on temperate and boreal species from various environments (Gigon & Rorison 1972; Havill et al. 1974; Lee & Stewart 1978; Gebauer et al. 1988; H\u00f6gbom & Ohlson 1991) .

Replicates of all species were collected in their original soil during the peak growing season (22-26 July). The number of replicates varied because some species were small and more abundant allowing for easy collection, resulting in many replicates while plants showing signs of stress after field collection were excluded from analyses. Each individual plant was placed in a 120-mm diameter, 120-mm tall plastic pot and transported by boat for 2 h (15 km) to a greenhouse located in Ny-\u00c5lesund (Fig. 1 ). Plants of each species were randomly separated into two groups both of which were analysed for NRA. One group represents constitutive enzyme activity values and these plants were kept in natural soil conditions. The second group was fertilized regularly with 15 mM KNO 3 to test if species had induction capacity of nitrate reductase activity above the field, or constitutive, levels. Plants were maintained at 9 -12 \u00b0C to simulate field conditions. NRA was determined during 1-21 August, a period with minimal spectral variation (Hisdal 1987) . Analyses were standardized using fresh leaf material, in mid-day sunlight at constant temperature, to minimize potential variation in enzyme activity associated with different plant organs (Lee & Stewart 1978; Gebauer et al. 1988) , circadian rhythms and leaf-age (Hipkin et al. 1984; Lillo 1984) , or the influence of light and temperature (Nicholas et al. 1976; Margolis et al. 1988 ). NRA was estimated by measuring the amount of nitrite reduced from nitrate following the methods of Guerrero (1985) . The bioassay was conducted on leaves because root reduction is a minimal portion of total plant NRA when large amounts of nitrate are available (Gebauer et al. 1988; Muller & Garnier 1990) . Within each species, care was taken to use 0.5 -1.0 g young leaf material. Because of betweenspecies differences in leaf size, the sampled mass corresponds to different numbers of leaves. These were cut into ca. 1 mm \u00d7 2 mm pieces which were placed in test tubes with phosphate buffer containing propanol-1 and 100 mM KNO 3 and incubated in the dark for 1 h at 28 \u00b0C in a water bath. Activity was stopped by immersion in boiling water for 25 min. The product, NO 2 -, was dyed with N(1-naphtyl) ethylene diamine dichloride, sulphamide, and 3 M HCl, and measured at 540 nm with a spectrophotometer (Schimadzu, model UV-240). NRA was calculated and reported as \u00b5mol of nitrite ions formed per gram of fresh weight of the plant per hour (\u00b5mol NO 2 -/g fw /h). The standard assay was conducted on all species.",

The r-vs. K-selection (Stearns 1976 ) may be useful in describing growth strategies which relate to species differences in NRA. C. groenlandica is short-lived, has a fast growth rate, high productivity, and high reproductive achievement (Fig. 3, group 4) , high capacity for photosynthesis and nutrient absorption, and the ability to exploit nutrient-rich environments.

The 'natural experiment' of this bird cliff provides an example of how extremes in abiotic conditions limit species diversity. In nutrient-rich habitats, inorganic N nutrition usually prevails, NO 3is the dominant form and NRA is of ultimate importance (Lee & Stewart 1978) . However, in poor sites species have other strategies for improving nutrient status such as nitrogenfixing mutualists, ericoid, or ectomycorrhizal symbioses which utilize complex organic sources of N. Conversely some species have preference for ammonium. Often species commonly mycorrhizal in nutrient-poor sites do not develop the association when growing in rich habitats. Cyanobacteria, for example, were found associated with moss in the bird cliff vegetation but the high nutrient levels inhibited nitrogen-fixation (B. Solheim pers. comm.). V\u00e4re et al. (in press) found that although Polygonum viviparum, Silene acaulis and Saxifraga oppositifolia are ectomycorrhizal in other areas, they did not have this association in Svalbard habitats. Some species can increase the amount of nitrate uptake per unit root as nitrate becomes limiting. Another adaptive strategy is to reduce growth rather than produce nutrient-deficient tissue.",

In a similar way, Gebauer et al. (1988) related nitrate and nitrate reduction levels of some central-European plants to the N-figures of Ellenberg (1979; Ellenberg et al. 1991 ). In the arctic bird cliff vegetation, values of maximally induced NRA reach 14.0 in the top two zones and decrease to 0.4 in lower zones; they provide appropriate scalar N-figures for the 42 species. Ellenberg and Gebauer et al. did not use figures above 9, and in order to relate to their system the N-figures would have to be converted. It is not yet clear how this should be done. A check on the Ellenberg-values for some species included both in his list (as alpine and montane species) and in mine gave confusing results; Oxyria digyna, the relatively most nitrophilous species on the arctic cliff, has an Ellenberg value of only 3. The N-figures as based on the maximally induced NRA figures are included in Table 1. N-figures can be used to predict changes in species composition and distribution following changes in nitrogen supply. Nitrogenous fertilizers are known to produce marked changes in vegetation species composition (e.g. Thurston 1969) , thus leading us to predict changes in bird cliff vegetation if nitrogen supply (e.g. decline or increase in seabird populations). In addition, plants with high N figures may be quick to respond to managed fertilization and be useful in revegetating disturbed areas in the Arctic.",
