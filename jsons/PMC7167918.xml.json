Although other phenotypic measurements of immunity remain relevant and useful, albeit limited in scope or technically difficult to apply in nonmodel organisms 2, these advances mean that studying the immunology of such organisms in the natural environment has become easier and can take on a genomewide perspective embodied, for example in techniques such as RNAseq. This can, in turn, be accompanied by powerful analytical approaches derived from systems biology 3 and statistical methodologies applied in ecology. When these elements are combined with the monitoring of natural fluctuation or experimental perturbation, it opens up the possibility of \u2018reverse engineering\u2019 the regulatory architecture of the immune system and its interaction with other organismal traits and with natural environmental pressures 3.",

Here, the great strengths are derived from the very refined use of inbred and genetically manipulated mice under controlled conditions that negate environmental variation. This is very successful for unpicking the structure of molecular pathways and workings of cellular populations, but relevance for natural environmental variation disappears where genetically unrepresentative individuals are studied under homogenous laboratory conditions and in the absence of a natural flora and fauna of symbionts 4, 5. (Here symbiont is defined as any organism involved in an intimate association with the host, including parasitic, commensal and mutualistic associations.) The present review will be concerned with how this \u2018blind spot\u2019 in modern immunology can be addressed by a focus on natural populations. It will scan the horizon for unique ways in which studies of nonmodel rodents can contribute to our wider understanding of the biology of the immune system and the way it interacts with the environment to determine health. Additionally, it will consider how immunological measurement, interpreted in the light of paradigms from laboratory mouse immunology, can define individual variation relevant to ecological and epidemiological studies of infectious disease in the natural environment 1, 6. Rather than produce an exhaustive list of possible interests, though, this review will concentrate on three broad reasons to study immunology in naturally occurring vertebrate hosts, reasons that seem particularly exciting because they could have major practical implications for human health and the welfare and productivity of domesticated animals.",

In particular, given the observed epidemiological trends in immunologically based disease, the questions might be asked: What are the immunological changes that occur in the transition from natural to more anthropogenic environments, and what triggers these changes? Several causal mechanisms have been considered, but to parasite immunologists one particularly influential and intuitive (but unproven) line of thought is that increased dysregulation of the immune system is ultimately caused by the host's co\u2010adaptation to stimuli from co\u2010evolved symbionts. These symbionts might include macroparasites and other agents of chronic infection that tend to be lost in anthropogenic environments 17.

This is because the remarkable laboratory models that have been established for revealing the molecular details of immunological pathways are unsuited to studying how these pathways interact with complex environments under natural conditions. It has often been noted that the genetics of laboratory mice does not reflect the natural situation 4. Typically, laboratory lineages are partly or completely inbred and often generated in a haphazard way that makes the range of allelic variation fixed in their genomes unrepresentative of natural variation 18. In the case of the fully inbred (isogenic) lines, their genomewide homozygosity is itself highly unnatural. Whilst these disadvantages would perhaps be overcome 19 by a range of carefully generated wild\u2010derived inbred and outbred lines 20, a much less tractable limitation lies in the inability to recreate natural environmental influences in the laboratory 5. Thus, wild animals experience a range of complex symbiont exposures and environmental stressors that cannot be sufficiently replicated in captivity 5. As such, wild mammals (and especially wild nonmodel rodents, due to some of the advantages discussed below) would seem a natural starting point to approach the problem of identifying environmental stimuli that drive immunological development and homeostasis in the wild. As previously considered in more detail by Friberg et al. 5, progress could be made either through in situ studies in natural populations tracking the effects of environmental variables using manipulative experimental or observational approaches (see for example, the wood mouse case study below), or through transplantation of naturally occurring lineages to (and monitoring of the changes occurring in) experimentally manipulated anthropogenic environments.",

As noted above, causative environmental factors likely exert their effects upon a background of significant immunogenetic variability inherited from wild ancestral populations. The subject area of wild rodents as models for this immunogenetic variability was reviewed in detail by Turner and Paterson 15 and will only be considered here sufficiently to provide a general overview relevant to the present article. Briefly, a parallel challenge to the one of identifying environmental factors driving immunopathological phenotypes in anthropogenic environments described above, then, is the one of revealing genetic variation that places individuals at risk 15. In other words, finding genetic variation that natural selection has shaped in a way that, although adaptive in some natural settings, has the potential to be maladaptive in anthropogenic environments.",

Although it is increasingly recognized that adaptive evolution has structured the polymorphism in genes controlling the vertebrate immune system 26, 27, 28, our knowledge of the dynamics of this selection is still rudimentary. Crucially, the types of genes and pathways that tend to undergo balancing selection, or frequent intermittent directional selection, in the natural environment are poorly known. Also, the nature of the selection involved and the phenotypic manifestations of the polymorphisms are not well understood. Studies of wild populations 29, 30, 31, 32, 33 are pivotal in this regard, as the wild is the only place in which natural selection, and the phenotypes upon which it operates, can be measured. Furthermore, given the conservation of the mammalian immune system, it seems likely that similar genes and pathways may be the target of pathogen\u2010mediated balancing selection across taxa. Future studies into the causes of immunogenetic variation (and the characterization of the associated phenotypes) in natural populations are thus likely to feed insights into the biomedical and veterinary fields through focussing attention on the types of gene predisposed to drive immunopathology due to ancestral adaptive evolution.",

And rodents are of particular interest in this regard, given their ecological importance and role as reservoirs for many zoonotic infectious agents 35, 36. In general, the dynamics of zoonotic and other ecologically important infectious diseases are likely to be influenced by heterogeneities amongst individual hosts 37, which will affect disease severity and transmission. As the immune system is the host's defence against infectious agents, variation within it is likely to generate much of this heterogeneity 32, 38. The measurement of immunological variation in real ecological contexts may, then, allow us to better define individual heterogeneity, and moreover, to address its environmental causes and epidemiological consequences 1, 39. This could help anticipate infectious disease risks in the environment. For example, such information may help to identify variations in immune defence that occur in time [e.g. seasonal 40, 41, 42] or space [e.g. habitat\u2013specific or along invasion fronts 43, 44] and that alter susceptibility to infectious agents; or it may help identify species 45, 46, or subsets within populations 47, whose immunological profiles indicate an increased likelihood to serve as permissive reservoir hosts for certain pathogens. For example, studies on variability in the expression of tnf\u03b1 and mx2 genes in bank voles (Myodes glareolus) have suggested the possibility of environmentally driven landscape\u2010level patterns that may affect the epidemiology of zoonotic Puumala hantavirus 47.",

Much emphasis has recently been placed on emerging and re\u2010emerging infectious diseases from wildlife reservoirs [for example, the One Health initiative 48] and the importance of undertaking pro\u2010active monitoring programmes. In addition to infection risk for humans and domesticated animals, it is likely that epidemic and endemic infectious disease may also contribute significantly to the dynamics of wildlife themselves and indirectly to higher level ecosystem functioning. Discovery of infectious agents of ecological importance, or that present a risk of zoonotic emergence is, however, limited by the fact that diagnostic techniques are specific to individual pathogens, or groups of pathogens. Whilst next\u2010generation sequencing (NGS) approaches are becoming available that allow very broad nonspecific surveys for pathogen sequences, these are costly and many individuals would have to be processed were a population to be sampled randomly. Given this, the detection of potential emergent infectious agents in wildlife could, in some cases, be facilitated by the monitoring of immunological expression 49. This would narrowly focus attention on individuals with aberrant immunological profiles that might be indicative of infection states. For example, these individuals could then be selected for further NGS studies 50, 51 in order to detect pathogen\u2010specific sequences correlating with the aberrant immune expression profiles.",

Such hosts may shed more infective particles into the environment than the endemic reservoir and also show signs of acute immune responses. For example, putative amplifier hosts may have been involved in the emergence of the SARS coronavirus. Here, the ultimate natural reservoir appears to include horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus spp.), but the infection was likely transmitted to human hosts indirectly via other wild mammals, including the palm civet (Paguma larvata) 53, which is highly susceptible to the virus and sheds high titres of infective particles 54. In scenarios where the aim is to identify emergent disease risks before any infectious agent is specifically identified, immune expression studies may provide a way to filter potential diseased amplifier individuals from natural populations and focus attention on these for further study. It is also likely that the pattern of immune expression may be indicative of the type of pathogen involved [as is increasingly being exploited in medical diagnostics 55] and that this may help target subsequent efforts at identification.",

Firstly, as they occur in the \u2018wild\u2019 today, rats and mice may have patchy population structures that are narrowly focussed on unnatural anthropogenic environments and are the result of a long history of anthropogenically linked dispersal. In the case of the mouse, for example, dispersal is believed to have occurred from the fertile crescent in the near east 58 across most of the globe following the expansion of human civilizations 59. This history of co\u2010habitation and dispersal means that house mice may harbour symbiont assemblages restricted by lineage sorting (extinction) during dispersal/colonization events and, as invasive organisms, they may have acquired new infections in their relatively recent evolutionary history. In response to selective forces acting during dispersal and gain/loss of infectious threats, such invasive species may also have undergone rapid genetically based changes in immune function 43, 60. These considerations (lack of a natural symbiont flora/fauna, an unusual evolutionary history of dispersal and frequent occupation of anthropogenic habitats) make rats and mice weaker natural models to assess \u2018hygiene hypothesis\u2019 or \u2018old friends\u2019 ideas. Here, where the hypothesis is that immunopathological phenotypes in anthropogenic environments arise from a lack of stimuli from co\u2010evolved symbionts, models are needed where the host co\u2010exists in its natural setting with a complete assemblage of co\u2010evolved symbionts.",

In contrast, in reverse engineering, large sets of responses (as generated by, for example, transcriptomic or multiplexed protein measurements) can be correlated with environmental and organismal variables of interest across perturbations (either natural or experimental), allowing interaction networks to be inferred 3. This can help establish how molecular pathways interact with each other and the environment to generate the observed phenotype. A reverse\u2010engineering\u2010like philosophy has, in part, featured in the examples dealt with below, and although these work with limited panels of measurements, they illustrate the potential for future studies using broader transcriptomic approaches.",

This model is relevant because H. bakeri is a very close relative 59, 83 of the H. polygyrus occurring in wood mice. Previously na\u00efve inbred mice exposed to single (CBA, BALB/c, C57BL/6, SWR) and trickle H. bakeri infections (BALB/c, C57BL/6), typically up\u2010regulated TLR responses signalling through myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (MyD88) at some point during the infection course, usually coinciding with peak standing worm burdens. This is consistent with a permissive effect of MyD88 signalling on gastrointestinal nematode infection demonstrated through experiments with Myd88 \u2212/\u2212 and interleukin one receptor one (Il1r1) \u2212/\u2212 mice 84, 85. It is interesting, though, that in the trickle infection experiments, resistance developed in both BALB/c and C57BL/6. This contrasts with more permissive infection phenotypes previously achieved under similar experimental regimens, where the susceptible strain C57BL/6 supports chronic infection and can continue accumulating worms to the point of lethality 86. Furthermore, in wild wood mice there is a linear accumulation of H. polygyrus with age and no indication of acquired immunity in the form of abundance as a decelerating function of age indicators 82. It may also be significant that the laboratory experiments, in initially na\u00efve animals, produced results consistent with the positive abundance \u2013 TLR response association seen in the wood mouse population during times of low parasite abundance, but were not consistent with the negative association seen at times of high parasite abundance. The latter negative association (and perhaps the permissive infection phenotypes noted above) could be accounted for by the well\u2010known immunosuppressive effects of chronic heligmosomatid infections.

            "text": "Taken together, all of this information indicates that macroparasite infection exposures may have significant and context\u2010dependent effects on the innate responses that mediate interactions of the immune system with microbes. The mechanism for this remains to be determined, but as discussed by Friberg et al. 5, the possibilities include effects on TLR signalling by worms that are direct, via secreted immunomodulators, or indirect, via feedback from adaptive immune responses. Other indirect effects could be mediated by altered exposure to microbes or innate damage signals resulting from the activities of macroparasites at their site of infection. There is some reason to believe that one or both of these last mechanisms might be important. Thus, heligmosomatid excretory\u2013secretory products 88, and the regulatory 87 and Th2 89 immune responses that these parasites typically trigger, generally reduce TLR\u2010mediated signalling. In the laboratory experiments, though, heligmosomatid infections actually increased TLR responses (perhaps consistent with activation by TLR ligands, which are primarily microbial\u2010 or damage\u2010associated patterns). This re\u2010emphasizes the possibility that co\u2010infections with macroparasites contribute to the network of interactions between commensal microbes and the immune system. Moreover, due to the epidemiological association of ectoparasitic lice with systemic responses in the Cotgrave Forest study, it seems that antiparasite responses at peripheral sites beyond the gut 78 may also be involved. The existence of such an extended interaction network is highly relevant to our understanding of how microbiotal exposures programme immunity. Because macroparasites are often absent in anthropogenic environments 5, this may contribute to the disruption of co\u2010evolved interactions (cf. the hygiene hypothesis). Thus, studies in a wild system have pointed towards the need for further work to establish the role of natural macroparasite communities in the formation of microbiotal assemblages and the contribution of this to health.",

These strategies are resistance, where the host prevents infection (denies access to the pathogen), and tolerance, where the host allows access to the pathogen whilst actively mitigating the negative effects of infection. Identifying patterns of tolerance and resistance in natural populations is problematical but can be approached using a general framework like that summarized in Jackson et al. 56. In cross\u2010sectional samples (\u2018snapshot\u2019 destructive samples of individuals), tolerance in identifiable groups of animals may be measured as the regression slopes (reaction norms) of fitness measures (for example, body condition) against infection load. Here there is the problem that, in individuals from natural populations, the infection dose and the time course of infection are not standardized. Reaction norms, though, can also be supplemented by consideration of the phase curves (temporal trajectories of fitness in relation to infection load) of infection courses in longitudinally sampled individual animals. These allow a known infection load to be related to fitness measurements at a later time point.

Under CR, increased condition would precede increased acquisition of parasites and the Gata3 responses they trigger; but in temporal series for individual mature males, these two sets of events, in reality, occurred in the reversed sequence. This observed sequence and the direction of association also contradict the prediction of DM of a negative effect of macroparasite infection (and the Gata3 responses triggered) on subsequent condition (which follows if infection is a major cause of mortality) \u2013 in reality there was a positive association. Perhaps most importantly, the DM and CR scenarios do not explain the age\u2010specific changes in the relationship between Gata3 expression and survival in longitudinal data, or in the relationship between Gata3, condition and macroparasite infection in the cross\u2010sectional data. Thus, if DM were true, Gata3 expression in peripheral blood would be expected to show a consistent negative association with individual survival, especially in classes of animal with an apparent Gata3\u2010associated tolerance pattern. However, in reality Gata3 expression decreases survival in smaller males (where a tolerance pattern is not seen) but tends to increase survival in larger animals (which do show the Gata3\u2010associated tolerance pattern). Furthermore, if CR were true, better conditioned animals would generally have higher parasite exposure and higher Gata3 expression; but in reality, this is only seen in mature males and not in immature males. It might also be argued that a special case of CR, which could explain the latter age\u2010specific pattern, is that better conditioned mature males range more, or have more social contacts, due to increased breeding activity. Even in this case, though, the wide\u2010ranging males would be expected to have better testis condition (if undergoing increased behaviours associated with breeding); but in our study, Gata3 expression was negatively correlated with testis condition.
