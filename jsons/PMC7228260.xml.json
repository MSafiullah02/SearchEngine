Whilst there is little specific evidence of COVID\u201019 infection being aggravated by immunomodulators as used in otherwise healthy dermatology patients, a precautionary approach is mandated, particularly as any secondary bacterial infection as part of COVID\u201019 may be aggravated by concurrent use of immunomodulators. Patients who are immunosuppressed appear to be at higher risk of a more severe infection or complications from COVID\u201019, although the extent of this risk is not known. Although median COVID\u201019 infection duration is in the order of 2 weeks, it would be sensible to discontinue systemic immunomodulators for at least 4 weeks, and until the patient has completely recovered.",

There is currently insufficient evidence to determine whether patients on systemic immunomodulators are at increased risk of becoming infected with COVID\u201019. Therefore, the benefit\u2010to\u2010risk ratio of any immunomodulator needs to be carefully assessed (see additional comments below).\nPatients with more severe skin disorders (e.g. severe psoriasis)\n2\n are inherently at increased risk of developing pneumonias of any cause.Whilst a number of clinical trials of the newer biologics used in dermatology patients indicate a slight increased risk of developing upper respiratory tract infections (URTI), there does not appear to be a significant increase risk of developing influenza (flu). However, annual influenza vaccination is strongly encouraged (but avoid the live attenuated influenza nasal vaccine).The COVID\u201019 pandemic is likely to continue for many months before being downgraded to seasonal epidemic status. This means a patient may have their immunomodulator withheld for many months.\n",
