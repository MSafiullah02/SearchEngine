MHV genes are expressed through a genome-sized virus specific mRNA and six or seven species of virus-specific subgenomic mRNAs with a 3\u2032-coterminal nested set structure (Lai et al., 1981, Leibowitz et al., 1981). The RNA genome is packaged together with nucleocapsid (N) protein and three envelope proteins: M (membrane), S (spike), and E (envelope).",

Since then, several anti-SARS agents have been tested for coronavirus-specific therapy; however, an effective SARS antiviral therapy has not yet been established (Groneberg et al., 2005, Haagmans and Osterhaus, 2006, Stockman et al., 2006). Ribavirin, a synthetic nucleoside with a broad antiviral activity, is most frequently administered as a SARS-antiviral agent in combination with corticosteroids; however, this has little activity against SARS-CoV in vitro (Cinatl et al., 2003). SARS-CoV specific monoclonal antibodies, pegylated interferon-\u03b1, siRNA, and several protease inhibitors have also been tested against SARS-CoV (in reviews, Cinatl et al., 2005, Groneberg et al., 2005, Haagmans and Osterhaus, 2006). Glycyrrhizin, pyridine N-oxide derivatives, ATPase and helicase inhibitors, and 4-aminoquinoline chloroquine have also been found to inhibit SARS-CoV replication in vitro (Balzarini et al., 2006, Cinatl et al., 2003, Keyaerts et al., 2004, Tanner et al., 2005). Wu et al. (2004) tested more than 10,000 agents, including more than 1000 traditional Chinese herbs, and found 50 active compounds. Interestingly, they found that 10 of these compounds, including aescin, reserpine, and ginsenoside-Rb1, came from natural products that have been used clinically (Wu et al., 2004).",

In addition, Cimicifuga rhizoma, Meliae cortex, Phellodendron cortex and Sophora subprostrata radix significantly decreased MHV production in the range of a 20-fold to 4-log10 reduction at 2 MOI, and an 8\u2013300-fold reduction at 20 MOI (Table 1, left, data not shown). Moutan cortex radicis decreased MHV production by approximately fivefold and fourfold at 2 and 20 MOI, respectively.",

MHV production was decreased in these experiments (Fig. 3\n), although to a lesser extent than the reductions we observed when the addition of the extract and infection were simultaneous (Table 1 and Fig. 2). The antiviral activity of the extracts diminished as viral replication proceeded; hence, MHV production correlated with the time of extract treatment. These results were probably dependent upon the replication stage of the virus and the length of time it was exposed to the extracts (Fig. 3). Treatment with the extracts Cimicifuga rhizoma, Meliae cortex, Coptidis rhizome, Phellodendron cortex, Moutan cortex radicis, and Sophora subprostrata radix, at 6 h post-infection decreased MHV production by 26-, 8-, 1612-, 15-, 2-, and 4-fold, respectively (Fig. 3).",

We could not determine the EC90 of Moutan cortex radicis due to a low anti-MHV activity (Fig. 1, Fig. 2, and Table 2). As expected, 10% of the MHV was produced when DBT cells were treated at EC90 (data not shown). In order to analyze the inhibition on viral entry, one set of DBT cells was infected with 2 MOI of MHV-A59 in the presence of extracts (EC90) from the adsorption period throughout the infection cycle. A second set of DBT cells were preadsorbed with MHV-A59 for 1 h at 4 \u00b0C without extracts, and un-adsorbed viruses were washed out. MHV-preadsorbed DBT cells were temperature-shifted to 37 \u00b0C at which temperature the viruses would be endocytosed, and they were further incubated with extracts at EC90 until completion of the experiment. We expected to discern whether the extracts interfered with virus replication at the entry point, or during the subsequent transcription or translation processes by comparing the RNA and protein expression in these two sets of MHV-infected and extract-treated DBT cells. If MHV-preadsorbed DBT cells expressed more or the same amount of viral RNA and protein as those of the MHV-infected and simultaneously extract-treated cells, it would indicate that the extract interfered with viral entry. In this experiment, however, all of the MHV-preadsorbed cells expressed less viral RNA and protein than the other set of cells (Fig. 4\n), indicating that viral entry was not the main target of the extracts tested.",

We could not exclude the possibility that the extracts tested in our study also inhibited cellular mechanisms that are used by viruses during replication. This would be interesting to test in the future. Nonetheless, the decrease in MHV that we observed in response to extract treatment was very strong compared to that of VSV, suggesting that the extracts are specific MHV inhibitors.",
