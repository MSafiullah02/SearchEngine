            "text": "Bats are poorly understood, yet have attracted increasing attention since being recognized as the source of numerous high-profile emerging viral diseases (Calisher et al., 2006). Fruit bats are known reservoir hosts of Hendra virus (Murray et al., 1995, Halpin et al., 2000), Nipah virus (Chua et al., 2000), Ebola virus (Leroy et al., 2005), Marburg virus (Towner et al., 2009), Melaka virus (Chua et al., 2007), and Australian bat lyssavirus (van der Poel et al., 2006, Speare et al., 1997), whereas microbats are known reservoir hosts of Rabies, and likely reservoir hosts of Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS CoV) (Lau et al., 2005, Li et al., 2005). While these viruses are highly pathogenic in other mammals, experimental studies and field observations have shown that bats rarely display clinical signs upon viral infection (Williamson et al., 1998, Calisher et al., 2006, Middleton et al., 2007, Towner et al., 2009, van den Hurk et al., 2009). One hypothesis under consideration is that bats possess qualitative differences in their innate immune system. In order to address this hypothesis, we are seeking to identify and characterise elements of the bat innate immune system.",

            "text": "In higher organisms, cellular recognition of infection begins with the engagement of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) which function by recognising conserved pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), thereby initiating signalling cascades that lead to inflammatory responses. The two major classes of virus-sensing PRRs are the transmembrane Toll-like receptors (TLRs) expressed on the cell surface or within endosomes, and the retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I)-like RNA helicases (RLHs) which are expressed cytoplasmically. The RLH gene family is evolutionarily ancient and consists of three genes; RIG-I (also known as DDX58), melanoma differentiation associated protein 5 (mda5/IFIH1), and laboratory of genetics and physiology 2 (LGP2/DHX58). We previously showed that fruit bats transcribe intact TLRs 1\u201310 and a TLR13-like pseudogene, and thus possess all of the TLRs believed to be involved in antiviral immunity in other mammals (Cowled et al., 2011); however this is the first study to determine whether bats also possess an intact set of RLHs.",

RIG-I and mda5 (but not LGP2) each contain two N-terminal caspase activation and recruitment domains (CARDs) required for downstream signalling (Johnson and Gale, 2006). RIG-I and mda5 recognise short and long dsRNAs respectively and RIG-I detects dsRNA with uncapped 5\u2032-triphosphate RNA (Hornung et al., 2006, Kato et al., 2008). Ligand binding produces a conformational change in RIG-I and mda5 that exposes the CARD domains, thereby permitting interaction with mitochondria-located adaptor molecule (MAVS/IPS1). This event initiates a signalling pathway that culminates in activation of transcription factors including IRFs and NF-\u03baB, which translocate to the nucleus to induce transcription of type I IFNs, proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines (Yoneyama and Fujita, 2010).",

RIG-I is implicated in the response to negative sense RNA viruses including flaviviruses, orthomyxoviruses, paramyxoviruses and rhabdoviruses, whereas mda5 is important in the response to positive sense RNA viruses such as picornaviruses, and is also a potent cytoplasmic receptor for poly I:C (Kato et al., 2006, Gitlin et al., 2006). When initially identified, overexpression of LGP2 in vitro resulted in apparent negative regulation of RIG-I and mda5 (Yoneyama et al., 2005; Rothenfusser et al. 2005), however knockout studies have since shown that LGP2 can positively regulate both RIG-I and mda5 signalling in some instances (Venkataraman et al., 2007, Satoh et al., 2010).

Inwards facing PCR primers were then designed from the RACE products to amplify the entire coding region of each gene as a single large PCR product, which was then cloned for sequencing. The longest transcript obtained for each gene was designated the prototype and full-length mRNA sequences were deposited into GenBank under the accession numbers JN031514-JN031516. Each gene contained a single open reading frame corresponding in size to homologues in other mammalian species. P. alecto RLH mRNA sequences were compared to the corresponding P. vampyrus genomic DNA sequences to determine the intron\u2013exon structure (Fig. 1\n). Mda5 was found to be the longest of the RLHs, consisting of 16 exons encoding a 3075 bp open reading frame (ORF). RIG-I consisted of 18 exons encoding a 2790 bp ORF, whereas LGP2 consisted of 12 coding exons plus one non-coding 5\u2019 exon encoding a 2037 bp ORF. The bat RLHs are of typical length and organisation to corresponding genes in other mammals, however bat RIG-I and LGP2 occupy considerably less genomic DNA than their human counterparts (RIG-I: 34 vs. 71 kb, LGP2: 8 vs. 11 kb) due to reduced intron sizes, whereas mda5 is similar in bat and human (50 vs. 52 kb). This is not an unexpected finding, since bat genomes are known to be more constrained than in other vertebrates, a feature shared with birds and hypothesised to be a consequence of adaptation to flight (Smith and Gregory, 2009). Kozak consensus sequences for strong eukaryotic translation consist of either adenine or guanine in the \u22123 position and guanine in the +4 position relative to the start codon (Kozak, 1997). LGP2 contained both Kozak elements (\u22123: adenine,+4: guanine), whereas RIG-I and mda5 each contained only one Kozak element (\u22123: adenine). Polyadenylation signals (AATAAA) were present in the 3\u2032 UTRs of all three transcripts in close proximity to the Poly A + tail.",

The predicted amino acid sequences were analysed by conserved domain analysis to identify putative domains (Fig. 2\n). Both RIG-I and mda5 (but not LGP2) contained two N-terminal CARD domains, while all three proteins contained a DExD/H-box RNA helicase domain and a C-terminal regulatory domain. The protein domain organisation of bat RLHs is therefore highly conserved with other mammalian species and thus indicative of similar function. At the amino acid sequence level, P. alecto RIG-I and LGP2 were 82% identical to their human counterparts, while P. alecto mda5 was 85% identical to human mda5. Phylogenetic trees were constructed based on the amino acid sequences of RIG-I, mda5 and LGP2 from P. alecto and other mammals (Fig. 3\n). P. alecto mda5 and LGP2 were most closely related to horse genes, followed by other members of Laurasiatheria. P. alecto RIG-I was slightly more divergent but still clustered with Laurasiatheria. At both the nucleotide and amino acid level, interspecies differences appeared to be evenly distributed across the open reading frame with no obvious hypervariable regions. Although several of the predicted branch points were only weakly supported by bootstrap analysis, these findings support the idea that fruit bats are quite closely related to horses. This is supported by a recent phylogenetic study based on retrotransposon insertion analysis (Nishihara et al., 2006), as well as findings from previous studies of bat immune genes (Fujii et al., 2010, Iha et al., 2009, Iha et al., 2010, Cowled et al., 2011) and our own additional observations, and might be considered significant in light of the fact that horses are the main spillover host for Hendra virus.",

The fact that all three individual bats had very similar transcription profiles, however, suggests reliable baseline data for this species. All three RLHs were expressed at moderate levels in all tissues examined, however they were most highly expressed in tissues rich in immune cell types: PBMC, spleen, lymph node and lung. Previously we described the distribution of TLRs in P. alecto tissues (Cowled et al., 2011), demonstrating that the viral recognition receptors TLRs 7, 8 and 9 were also expressed at high levels in immune-rich tissues, at copy numbers substantially higher than observed here for the RLHs. In contrast, all three RLHs were expressed at higher copy numbers than TLR3 in all tissues examined, with the exception of liver in which TLR3 mRNA is elevated. Baseline expression of mda5 mRNA was minimal in P. alecto brain tissue, as is the case in both humans and mice (Kang et al., 2002, Furr et al., 2008).",

            "text": "In other mammals, signalling through Type I and Type III IFN receptors results in upregulation of a large number of genes collectively known as IFN stimulated genes (ISGs). These include well-characterised antiviral genes such as Mx, PKR and OAS1, which help to establish the \u2018antiviral state\u2019 (Onoguchi et al., 2007). RLHs are important mediators of IFN production, but are also upregulated by IFN signalling in a positive feedback loop; hence they are also considered to be ISGs. Having confirmed that poly I:C stimulation induced rapid IFN upregulation in PaKiT03 cells, we tested to see whether this correlated with increased transcription of RIG-I, mda5 and LGP2 (Fig. 6\n). RIG-I, mda5 and LGP2 were all strongly upregulated at 3 h post poly I:C challenge, supporting the assertion that bat RLHs are also ISGs. This result is consistent with our previous results demonstrating upregulation of RIG-I following stimulation with recombinant IFN-\u03bb in a bat foetal cell line (Zhou et al., 2011). At higher doses of poly I:C (\u2a7e1 \u03bcg/ml), upregulation of all three RLHs was higher for treated cells than transfected cells. This may reflect minor differences in the kinetics of the response or differences in sensitivity between endogenous and exogenous dsRNA-sensing pathways, but does not directly correlate with the IFN response. It was noted that LGP2 was more strongly upregulated than either RIG-I or mda5 upon poly I:C stimulation.",

            "text": "It has been proposed that bats\u2019 role as reservoir hosts of zoonotic viruses combined with an apparent ability to withstand viral infections without showing signs of disease may reflect fundamental differences in the bat immune system. Despite the potential significance of this proposal and the increasing scientific and public interest in bats, major gaps exist in our basic understanding of bat immunity. Due to the critical role of cytoplasmic RNA sensors in innate immune responses to viral infection in other mammals, we sought to characterise the RIG-I-like helicase gene family in the fruit bat P. alecto. We hypothesised that bat RLHs may have atypical features that could imply altered immune response to viral infections; however our data lead us to conclude that they instead share a high degree of similarity with those in other mammalian species. Previous studies on pteropid bats to date have similarly shown high levels of sequence similarity between bat immune genes and their counterparts in other mammals, including descriptions of immunoglobulin heavy chains (Baker et al., 2010), CD4 (Omatsu et al., 2006), IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 (Omatsu et al., 2008, Kepler et al., 2010), IFN-\u03bb (Zhou et al., 2011), STAT1(Fujii et al., 2010), IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12p40, TNF\u03b1 (Iha et al., 2009) and TLRs (Iha et al., 2010, Cowled et al., 2011).",

It is also clear that new approaches are required to identify components that do not have a clear homologue in other mammals, or function only in immune cell types. It is clear that the publically available genome of the pteropid bat P. vampyrus contains many errors, as many genes are incomplete, miss-assembled, or missing entirely. Furthermore, as it has been assembled based on similarity to the human genome, it is possible that elements which may contribute to altered immune function are excluded from the assembly for the very reason that they do not have a human counterpart. Basic characterisation of clearly-defined prototype bat immune genes therefore remains a high priority that will lead to greater understanding of the bat immune system and enable the development of much-needed reagents. We thus conclude that the RLHs are intact and apparently functional in P. alecto, and therefore likely to be critical components of the bat innate antiviral immune system, as they are in other mammals.",
