            "text": "Though the medical conditions are improved significantly, epidemics have never been away from human world, especially in developing countries. Of growing concerns are adverse synergistic interactions between the emerging diseases and other infectious. Poor sanitation and lack of medical knowledge lead to the wide spreading of disease in developing countries, such as Ebola and MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus). Besides, some of traditional contagions are resistant to drug treatments now, such as malaria, tuberculosis, and bacterial pneumonia. These kinds of diseases are defined as new emerging infectious disease (EID), which have increased in the past 20 years and will keep growing in the near future  [1]. There are several remarkable characteristics in the EID: unpredictable, not preventable, irremediable, high mortality, rapid transmission and wide scope of influence. The expansion of disease spreading can lead to social panic at some level. It is hence imperative to study effective control strategies to prevent the disease diffusion.",

            "text": "Many of researchers have tried to explore the prevention measures of EID. As a practical method, the information diffusion on epidemic dynamic has attracted much attention in recent years. A path-breaking work in this field was taken by Funk et al., who proposed an epidemiological model that considers the spread of awareness about the disease  [2], [3]. Lima et al. proposed that the propagation of disease can be reduced by the spreading of immune information, which make individuals resistant to disease and then work against the epidemic propagating  [4]. A model of competing epidemic spreading over completely overlapping networks was proposed by Karrer and Newman, revealing a coexistence regime in which both types of spreading can infect a substantial fraction of the network  [5]. Wang and Tang distinguish two types of disease spreading and proposed the dynamic model of asymmetrically interacting and disease spreading. Their research focuses on three problems: the different network structures and information spreading dynamics; the asymmetric effects of one type of spreading dynamics on another; the timing of the two types of spreading  [6]. Moreover, several researches are also meaningful to us  [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12]. Trpevski et al. explored the rumors propagation in multiple networks  [7]. Zhang et al. proposed a model considering time delay and stochastic fluctuations  [8]. Ababou et al. investigated the spreading of periodic diseases and synchronization phenomena on exponential networks  [9]. Rakowski et al. put forward an individual based model to study the effects of influenza epidemic in Poland. A simple transportation rule is established to mimic individuals\u2019 travels in dynamic route-changing schemes, allowing for the infection spread during a journey  [10]. All the above efforts are worth approving but the specific ways of message spreading are ignored. This paper enriches the research in this area, and the proposed methods are shown to have a significant effect in epidemic prevention.",

The infection period is further divided into latent period and invasion period. The former is characterized by the tiny indisposition; the latter is featured by onset of clinical signs and symptoms. Moreover, according to the research of Lessler et al., the latent period is essential to the investigation and control of infectious disease  [14]. In this period, the infectious individuals have obtained the ability to spread diseases, yet without obvious symptom to arise attention, e.g., the latent period of influenza remains only one to three days, yet the epidemic can sweep through a city in less than six weeks. Furthermore, according to the health experts Sartwell\u2019s research, the period of latent period varies between individuals in the same regular fashion as do other biological characteristics  [15]. The distribution of days seems to follow the \u201cnormal\u201d curve. Based on their theory, we investigate several common infectious diseases and collect their incubation period in Table 1\nand then get the average length of latent period which approximates to 7 days.",

The rate in invasion period ranges from 0.5 to 1. (2) To simplify the model, the average length of latent period is uniformly set to 7 days, which is important to the experiments in Section  4.

When in \u201cmessaging\u201d status, the specific persons, denoting the ones who have just been isolated or their directly connected neighbors, would deliver specific messages to their neighbors. Timely isolation and message-delivery are the main prevention measures in our model, especially the latter.

            "text": "Now, we will consider the specific situation of each individual in the population. Assume a closed population of N individuals, connected by a neighboring structure which is denoted by the undirected and unweighted graph G=(V,E), with nodes (termed as V) representing individuals and edges (termed as E) representing connections between individuals. Let Li represent the adjacency list of node i, i.e., if (i,j)\u2208E set j\u2208Li; j\u2209Li otherwise. At time t, each node i can be in one of three statuses: susceptible, infectious and isolated. The status is described as a status vector, containing a single 1 in the position corresponding to the current state, and 0 everywhere else. Let Statusi(t)=[si0(t),si1(t),si2(t)]. The probability function of each status is set to Probi(t)=[pi0(t),pi1(t),pi2(t)]. The state transition processes is shown in Fig. 1\n. Status 0 is the initial state, and status 2 is the final state. When connected to the node in status 1, nodes in status 0 may turn into status 1 at a certain rate. Nodes in status 1 could keep their status or convert into status 2 on either latent period or invasion period. Evolution of the model is given by the formulas (2.2){pi0(t+1)=si0(t)(1\u2212ui(t))pi1(t+1)=si0(t)ui(t)+(1\u2212vi(t))si1(t)pi2(t+1)=vi(t)si1(t)+si2(t),(2.3)Statusi(t+1)=Multi Realize[Probi(t+1)], where Multi Realize can be interpreted as a realization of random realization for the probability distribution Probi(t), or a mapping from probability vector to status vector. For each node i, ui(t) and vi(t) represent its infecting rate and isolating rate respectively. In the study in Section  2.1, the isolating rate of disease is defined as {v1|v1\u2208(0,0.5)} when in latent period. When in invasion period, the isolating rate is defined as {v2|v2\u2208[0.5,1)}. The infecting rate ui(t) is given by (2.4)ui(t)=(1\u2212\u220fj=1N(1\u2212\u03b2lijsj1(t)))(1\u2212mi(t))f(1\u03b8). Each node in status 1 tries to infect its neighbor node at time t. Each try may be successful with a rate \u03b2. If j\u2208Li, set lij=1, and lij=0 otherwise. In formula (2.4), if mi(t)=0, set f(1\u03b8)=1; If mi(t)>0, set f(1\u03b8)=1\u03b8. Parameter \u03b8 could take any of values in the set {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10}, which stand for the quality of information. It could be measured by the characteristics of messages like authority, accuracy, availability, etc. The higher value corresponds to the higher quality. Moreover, the information quantity is defined by (2.5)mi(t)=a\u2211i=1ni112i+b\u2211i=1ni212i(a+b=1,a>b>0). Lima et al. have proposed that the public-facing information distribution may cause a considerable amount of neglect  [4]. Therefore, the directional message delivery is essential to warn the crowds who are under high risk of being infected. Simultaneously, as the receiving and accumulating of messages, the newly received messages perform a gradually decreasing effect. Accordingly, geometric series is adopted here to simulate the process. Owing to its convergence properties, mi(t) will never be over 1. ni1 and ni2, representing the total amount of direct and indirect messages respectively, are given by (2.6){ni1(t)=\u2211j=1Nlijsj2(t)ni2(t)=\u2211j=1N(lij\u2211k=1Nljklik\u2212sk2(t)). The messages, sent from one node (in status 2) to its direct-neighbors, are defined as direct messages, while the messages sent to the direct-neighbors\u2019 neighboring nodes are defined as indirect messages. a and b are the influence rates of two types of messages. For node i, ni1(t) represents the total number of its direct-neighbors who are isolated, and ni2(t) represents the total number of its neighbors\u2019s neighboring nodes who are isolated.",

If not, it would continue to spread disease within the scope of 100 km. The process is derived from Eqs. (2.2), (2.3).",

It can be attributed to the convenient and fast movement of human beings. In Fig. 7\n(a), the red line describes the diseases which are infectious in both latent period and invasion period, while the orange line depicts diseases which are infectious only in latent period. Making a comparison, the former is over 7.14% than the latter. After analyzing, we summarize two reasons to express the weak distinction: firstly, most neighboring nodes have been infected and the space of infection becomes smaller in invasion period; secondly, the high isolation rate reduces the number of infectors. The green line in Fig. 7(b) represents the number of infectors while taking preventive measures. Compare to the previous red line, number of infectors decreases over 68.7%.",

Green points represent the susceptible people; red points stand for the infected people; blue points denote both the isolators and immune people (who collect enough messages). Source of infection is located in North America. To simulate the free spreading process of disease, there is no prevention measure in the beginning. As we can see from the first four panels, the uncontrolled disease spreads from America to the Europe and Asia successively. In fact, the prevention measures are started at the fourth week but remain with a weak and limited power. We attribute it to the latent period of disease, which is set to a week basis. Later in the fifth and sixth weeks, the regional infectious disease evolves into a global outbreak. Most of patients are experiencing the invasion period clinically and may be isolated at a very high rate. The immune measures show their great effects right now. The covering square of blue points is expanding. After nine weeks, the epidemic is under control completely.Fig. 8Epidemic dynamics under measures of quarantine and message-delivery. The process is developed by the model in Section  2.2. Set v1=0.2,v2=0.9,a=0.6,b=0.4,\u03b8=7. First begin with a random node in North America as source of infection.

(ii) Infectious diseases are easy to control as long as the propagating message achieves a certain quality.
