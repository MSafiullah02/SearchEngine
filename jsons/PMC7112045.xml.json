TGEV is an enveloped CoV, with a large positive-sense single-stranded RNA genome, about 28.5 kb in length. It has a diameter ranging from 80 to 120 nm, including surface projections. Porcine intestinal columnar epithelial cells (IPEC-J2) offer a practical model for studying porcine enteric pathogens (Brosnahan and Brown, 2012). We will use this model to study the entrance mechanism of TGEV.",

There has been some confusion around the question that if APN is the only receptor for TGEV entry, why older piglets are not susceptible to TGEV, especially since APN was found to be highly expressed in villous enterocytes of both newborn and older piglets. Research suggest a known protein, approximately 200-kDa in size, only expressed in the upper villi of newborn piglets, it has high affinity for TGEV (Weingartl and Derbyshire, 1994). It has also been demonstrated that APN is not essential for PEDV cell entry (Ji et al., 2018, Li et al., 2017). It is most likely that TGEV do have more than one receptor.",

            "text": "Many cell surface components have been identified as virus receptors, including: chemokine receptors (Feng et al., 1996), fibroblast growth factor receptors (Qing et al., 1999), the tumor necrosis factor receptor family (Terry-Allison et al., 1998), and integrin (Wang et al., 2005). pidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), a member of the receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) family, is widely expressed on many cells including epithelial and mesenchymal cells (Wells, 1999b). It has been demonstrated that many viruses interact with EGFR to facilitate viral entrance, including: influenza A virus (IAV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV), and human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) (Chan et al., 2009, Eierhoff et al., 2010a, Lupberger et al., 2011, Zheng et al., 2014b). Ligand binding to EGFR induce receptor dimerization and cross phosphorylation, which in turn actives the intracellular signaling cascades critical for cellular protein synthesis, cytoskeleton re-organisation, apoptotic inhibition, transcriptional activation, and cell motility. The ligand binding to EGFR results in rearrangement of the cytoskeleton network through EGFR-mediated signaling, and subsequently ligand-EGFR complexes are internalize through clathrin-coated pits (Zheng et al., 2014a). Many researchers have shown that numerous viruses utilize EGFR endocytosis to mediate virus internalization (Mercer et al., 2010a). The interactions between viruses and their receptors are specific, but the affinity is low. Many multiple receptor binding sites exist on virus particles which are likely to cluster receptor proteins. It is known that multiple viruses use more than one type receptor to aid uptake into host cells (Marsh and Helenius, 2006). EGFR also has been identified as a co-receptor for many viruses, such as human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), and adeno-associated virus serotype 6 (AAV6) (Lupberger et al., 2011, Wang et al., 2003, Weller et al., 2010). Previous studies that we have conducted demonstrated that TGEV spike protein interacts with EGFR, and stimulates phosphorylation of cofilin as well as stimulating polymerization of F-actin through the PI3K-Rac1/Cdc42-PAK-LIMK signaling pathway. This is required for efficient TGEV entry (Hu et al., 2016). We further demonstrate whether EGFR is another co-factor for TGEV. EGFR is a transmembrane protein with two dimer forms, it can be divided into extracellular, transmembranal, and intracellular regions. Its extracellular region contains two receptor-binding domains Receptor 1 (57-168 aa) and Receptor 2 (361-481 aa). Its intracellular protein associated with tyrosine kinase PI3K/Akt and Ras/Raf/ERK1/2 pathways are activated by phosphorylated tyrosine located in EGFR cytoplasmic tails (\nFig. 1A). The objective of our present study was also to study the relationship between APN and EGFR in the early stage of TGEV infection.",

The level of p-EGFR increased, APN and EGFR were co-localization significantly (\nFig. 2). To determine the role of EGFR and APN in mediating TGEV infection, lentivirus interference methods were used to reduce the expression of EGFR and APN. IPEC-J2 cells were transfected with lentivirus constructs that expressed APN or EGFR targeting shRNAs. APN or EGFR expression level reduced significantly (\nFig. 3A and B). The results of Real-time reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) for detection of TGEV invasion revealed that APN-targeting shRNA, EGFR-targeting shRNA, and APN + EGFR-targeting shRNAs, significantly inhibited TGEV entry. The inhibition of APN + EGFR-targeting shRNAs was seen to be more significant (Fig. 3E). These results were further verified by flow cytometry, TGEV particles were labeled with fluorescent probe DyLight 488, APN-targeting shRNA, and EGFR-targeting shRNA inhibited the invasion of TGEV with the similar results. APN+EGFR-targeting shRNAs showed a more significant inhibitory effect (Fig. 3D and E). TGEV infection was measured in the supernatant of infected IPEC-J2 cells by TCID50 (Fig. 3F). Plaque formation in ST cells by the intracellular of infected IPEC-J2 cells showed that APN + EGFR-targeting shRNAs inhibited TGEV entry more significantly (Fig. 3G).

In APN overexpressed, EGFR overexpressed, and APN+EGFR overexpressed cells, Overexpression of EGFR and APN were confirmed in\nFigs. 4A and S1, TGEV infection caused an a comparably increased phosphorylation level of EGFR, Akt, as well as ERK1/2 than that of the TGEV infection control group (Fig. 4A and C). In APN-targeting shRNA, EGFR-targeting shRNA, and APN+EGFR-targeting shRNAs cells, TGEV infection resulted in the decreased phosphorylation level of EGFR, Akt, and ERK1/2 significantly in comparison to the TGEV infection control group (Fig. 4F\u2013H). APN-targeting shRNA inhibited TGEV-induced EGFR activation more significantly than EGFR-targeting shRNA (Fig. 4B and F). These data demonstrated that APN is required for TGEV-induced EGFR activation. Hence, TGEV binding to APN induces EGFR activation and is required for viral entry.",

The clathrin or caveolin expression level was reduced significantly (\nFig. 5A and B). RT-PCR for detection TGEV invasion results showed that both clathrin and caveolin targeting shRNAs significantly inhibited TGEV entry (Fig. 5C and D). This data was reinforced by flow cytometry, TGEV particles were labeled with fluorescent probe DyLight 633, clathrin-targeting shRNA, and caveolin-targeting shRNA which inhibited the invasion of TGEV (Fig. 5E and F). The viral titers of intracellular TGEV were also analyzed by TCID50 (Fig. 5G). Our previous studies have found that nystatin, an cholesterol removing agent which also functions by inhibiting the lipid/caveolin pathway can in fact inhibit TGEV binding and entry. This result also show us that caveolin-mediated endocytosis is a method that can be utilized in TGEV internalization. To verify and confirm our results, clathrin and caveolin mediated endocytosis specific markers were used to provide direct evidence in an attempt to prove the TGEV endocytosis pathway. We found that both FITC-transferrin and FITC-Ct-B were co-localized with DyLight 594-TGEV (Fig. 5H and I). Taken together, we confirmed that both clathrin and caveolin mediated endocytosis are important for TGEV entry.",

Our previous published research found that TGEV can be internalized into IPEC-J2 cells, however the mechanism of TGEV entry is still not known.

Some previous studies have suggested clathrin-coated pits can form naturally at 0 \u00b0C in the presence of EGF, but are not internalized into the cytoplasm (Brown and Petersen, 1998, Jiang et al., 2003). Clathrin-coated pits connected to the cell surface and clathrin-coated vesicles are intracellular membranal structures. Lipid rafts function as platforms to active intracellular EGFR effector signals and EGFR internalization (Puri et al., 2005). In this study we found that when EGF was incubated with cells at 4 \u00b0C for 1 h, EGF formed clathrin-coated pits connected to the cell surface and EGFR became localized in the coated pits. When cells were transferred at 37 \u00b0C, EGFR was rapidly internalized into the cytoplasm through clathrin-coated vesicles. For TGEV infected cells, TGEV particles bound with cells at 4 \u00b0C. As soon as cells were transferred at 37 \u00b0C, TGEV stimulated clustering of lipid rafts and activated EGFR and effector signals. This process took comparatively more time, hence at 15 mpi, EGFR was found to begin internalization of TGEV particles. In this study, we found that TGEV infection caused EGFR internalization, and clathrin-targeting shRNA inhibited EGFR internalization. EGFR also was identified as an another receptor for TGEV. We can get to the conclusion that in the early infection stage of TGEV, TGEV particles bound with APN and EGFR, the virus-receptors complex are subsequently internalized by clathrin. Caveolin targeting shRNA has no effect on the internalization of EGFR. However further research is needed to specify the mechanism of TGEV particles internalized by caveolin.",
