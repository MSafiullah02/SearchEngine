However, their arguments seem to be based on inaccurate assumptions about the MHLW's measures for SARS.",

Information on all cases, totalling 16 probable cases and 52 suspected cases, was made available to the public through our website and the mass media within a working day of being received. Furthermore, the MHLW's specialist committee on SARS examined all reported cases to judge the possibility of SARS, and the conclusions were also announced promptly with the relevant explanation.",

However, we think that our cautious attitude could not have affected local-level activities to prevent SARS because responsible health centres appropriately coped with the reported cases, gathering enough information from physicians in charge, patients, and other related people. Additionally, the MHLW made all possible efforts to provide technical guidance on how to fight SARS.",
