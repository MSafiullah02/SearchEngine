            "text": "By April 10, 2020 the number of COVID-19 cases in New York reached nearly 160,000 (with over 92,000 cases in the metropolitan region alone), a staggering and grim state statistic that alone exceeded that of any country. On March 16, about one week before New York was labeled the epicenter of the pandemic, the New York Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (NYSGE) issued guidelines that built on those from national societies and published narratives from other global epicenters. [1] [2] [3] [4] The urgent communication strongly emphasized prioritization of endoscopic procedures, outlined operational practices of the endoscopy suite, and defined PPE standards to be followed during endoscopy. Yet our growing experience and variability in regional rates of infections, availability of resources, and institutional guidance necessitates tailoring of national recommendations. Most guidelines have yet to address practical changes to management of GI consults and common GI issues in response to the pandemic.",

These modifications follow several guiding principles that are listed in Table 1 and focus on rethinking methods for the assessment of patients with GI diseases, modifying strategies for intervention, and working in tandem with other services to achieve acceptable outcomes. An unexpected consequence of this virus's attack is the hijacking of our standards of excellence and coercion to change our practice in ways that contradict our sensibilities. This narrative review describes some of our proposed solutions to these unfamiliar challenges. By sharing our collective experience we hope that regions of the country yet to endure the full brunt of this contagion will be better informed to implement similar strategies and mitigate what has proven to be a relentless and sustained attack on us all.",

By the 3rd week of the pandemic the large hospital systems were 40-80% filled with COVID patients, with up to 25% requiring intensive care unit (ICU) care in some locations. On average, GI services in these hospitals decreased their procedural volume by 80-90% and the consultative volume by 50%. By the time of this writing, repurposing endoscopy suites to COVID care units has occurred in many of the hospital systems in the region. Procedures are now largely relegated to the operating room (OR) or to the bedside in ICUs, and approved indications remain sharply restricted. Anesthesiologists and their equipment are being used to furnish makeshift ICUs while endoscopy staff, including GI faculty and many of New York's 400 fellows, are redeployed throughout the hospital. Many institutions have created central OR committees to review all procedures and surgeries in order to ensure fair provision of resources across the hospital. GI procedures and consults are performed by only 1-2 faculty members, most often a general GI consult attending and an interventionist, who is not typically in the hospitalist redeployment pool. Undeployed fellows play supporting and non-patient contact roles or staff virtual outpatient consults. Finally, some programs have consolidated all GI services, including subspecialty services such as pancreaticobiliary, IBD and transplant hepatology, into one consultative service for all consults.",

However, over the few weeks that followed individual institutions went through volatile changes of PPE availability that mandated revised policies. By executive order, ambulatory surgical centers (ASCs) were mandated to stop performing elective procedures and as result many have been forced to close entirely. Some centers, particularly those with hospital affiliations, have been repurposed as COVID care centers while others have redirected staff and equipment resources to assist in the COVID response. Sustained community transmission combined with still limited availability of testing, high false negative rates (~40%), and presumed high prevalence of asymptomatic carriers forced revision of guidelines, including those listed in Table 2 , to be followed for procedures regardless of venue or a patient's COVID status. Changes in indications for procedures will be discussed separately below. Since most procedures now occur off-site, efforts should be made to perform them during the day when more resources and staff are available to manage intra-procedural modifications or complications.",

A recent regional survey demonstrated that 70% of consults during this time are for GI bleeding. 6 While overt GI bleeding typically prompts rapid endoscopic evaluation, procedural parsimony is the new rule. Across institutions, our consensus found that urgent upper endoscopies were rarely performed within the first 24 hours. Similarly, procedures for lower GI bleeding were nearly uniformly deferred and have been postponed to the outpatient venue. While these strategies were not driven by pre-pandemic studies regarding the timing of endoscopic intervention, this practice has fortuitously been reflected in emerging literature. 7, 8 Returning to basic principles of resuscitation, optimizing medical management, and exhausting alternative diagnostic modalities allows us to focus only on procedures most likely to be therapeutic. COVID-19 infection can mimic or exacerbate the hemodynamic effects of GI bleeding and an effort should be made to discern between the two by administering acetaminophen, intravenous fluid and blood products as indicated. While aggressive medical management should be individualized, it is worth considering PPI infusions over intermittent IV administration, liberalized octreotide infusions for patients with suspected or known liver disease, scheduled antiemetics, platelets and/or clotting factors to correct iatrogenic or acquired coagulopathies, and reversal agents if appropriate. Emerging experience in critically ill COVID patients suggests they can develop a pro-thrombotic form of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), placing them at a dramatically increased risk of thrombosis. Many of these patients may therefore be receiving newly prescribed anticoagulants which need to be considered when evaluating and managing GI bleeding issues in this cohort.",

For all inpatients and ongoing symptoms in outpatients, GI pathogen testing including Clostridium difficile should be considered, particularly in those with signs like leukocytosis or those with risk factors such as recent antibiotic use. In the absence of a bacterial pathogen, medical management with anti-emetics and anti-diarrheals (e.g. loperamide) can be optimized. Careful monitoring of the QTc is essential, as many antiemetics prolong the QT, particularly when combined with other agents being used for COVID-19 that also affect the QTc (hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin).

Feeding in the prone position may lead to decreased gastric emptying, vomiting and aspiration but studies have shown mixed results. Voort et al showed that EN can be continued when a patient is turned from supine to prone position (or vice versa) without consequence. The results indicated that patients with a clinically significant gastric residual volume in one position are still likely to have a clinically significant gastric residual volume in the other position. 12 Reignier et al later concluded that early EN is poorly tolerated in the prone position and use of a prokinetic agent should be considered. 13 Subsequent meta-analysis have not suggested a substantial increase in complications when EN is administered in the prone compared with the supine position. 14 We suggest EN via NGT while prone should be used with caution and patients should be watched for signs of intolerance or vomiting.",

This creates challenges coordinating infusions since many offices are not seeing new patients, or have limited appointments creating a long wait time for patients to see a new provider. Some patients cannot get alternative access to treatments and require remote care. Though potentially suboptimal, this may require switching to subcutaneously administered in-class therapies. In cases where this option does not yet exist (anti-integrin therapy), consider delaying infusions or advocating with local physicians to seamlessly transfer care. Home infusions for patients in other states create new logistical challenges. Unless the patient has established a relationship with a local physician who would be able to manage any complications, we were reluctant to support this strategy.
