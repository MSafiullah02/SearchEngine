Methods: Surfaces of objects were routinely wiped with 1000 mg/L chlorine containing disinfectant. Air and sewage disinfection was proceeded routinely and strictly. Hospital environmental surfaces and PPE of staffs in isolation wards were sampled using swabs. The sewage from various inlet and outlets were sampled. The respiratory and stool specimens of patients were collected. The respiratory specimens of staffs in the isolation wards were also sampled once a week. Quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) methods were used to confirm the existence of SARS-Cov-2 RNA. Viral culture was done for the samples positive for SARS-Cov-2 RNA. Results: During the study period, 33 laboratory-confirmed patients were hospitalized in isolation wards in the hospital. None of SARS-Cov-2 RNA was detected among the 36 objects surface samples and 9 staffs PPE samples in isolation wards. Though the 3 sewage samples from the inlet of preprocessing disinfection pool were positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA and the sample from the outlet of preprocessing disinfection pool was weakly positive, the sewage sample from the outlet of the last disinfection pool was negative. All of the 5 sewage samples from various points were negative by viral culture of SARS-Cov-2. None of the respiratory specimens of staffs in the isolation wards were positive. Conclusions: Though SARS-Cov-2 RNA of the sewage samples were positive from inlets of the sewage disinfection pool and negative from the outlet of the last sewage disinfection pool, no viable virus was detected by culture. The monitoring data in this study suggested that the strict disinfection and hand hygiene could decrease the hospital-associated COVID-19 infection risk of the staffs in isolation wards.",

The virus was subsequently renamed SARS-CoV-2 as it is similar to the coronavirus responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV), a member of the subgenus Sarbecovirus (Beta-CoV lineage B). The transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is associated with close contact to COVID-19 patients and droplet secretions of those patients. According to a report from the China Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, up to February 24th 2020, 3387 medical staffs were confirmed with COVID-19, of which were mainly occurred in January 2019 from Hubei Province (Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia Emergency Response Epidemiology, 2020; Wang et al., 2020) . The occurrence of healthcare-associated infections might be closely related to pathogens contamination in the hospital environment (Beggs et al., 2015 , Chowell et al., 2015 . The outbreak of this novel virus placed challenges on hospital environmental hygiene. Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the isolation wards in general hospitals have all been transformed into temporary infectious disease wards.",

Confirmed patients of COVID-19 were hospitalized in the 3 isolation wards including one Isolation Intensive Care Unit (ICU) ward and two general Isolation wards. Each isolation ward was separated into three parts and two passages. Three zones including contaminated area, semi-contaminated area, and clean area. A contaminated area is a specifically designated area for patients of COVID-19 and contaminated items such as patients' wastes. A clean area is a specifically designated area for non-contaminated items. Patients should not enter the clean area. Semi-contaminated area was set up between the contaminated area and the clean area. The items were potentially polluted can be placed in this area. Doctor's offices were placed in this area. While two passages are a passage for medical staff and a passage for patients. Buffer room is set up between a contaminated zone and a semi-contaminated zone. In each isolation ward, two buffer zones are set up for removing the staff PPEs in accordance with the transmission features of COVID-19. The suspected patients of COVID-19 were nursed in single rooms, while the confirmed patients of COVID-19 were cohorted in cubicles with bed spacing of not less than 1.2 meters. The isolation rooms were not under negative pressure because the isolation wards were reconducted temporarily.",

In recent studies, environmental sampling also has identified contamination in field-settings with SARS-CoV-2 . If SARS-CoV-2 transfers to hands or other equipment at a concentration above the infectious dose, it will initiate infection through contact with the eyes, nose or mouth by indirect contact. Thus, an effective disinfection is very necessary for hospital infection control and medical staffs' protection. With the outbreak of COVID-19 in China, the isolation wards in general hospitals have all been transformed into temporary wards in order to meet the standard of isolation wards in infectious disease hospitals. Such temporary isolation wards might have many concerns. Further environmental monitoring assessments are necessary.",

With routine cleaning and disinfection, none of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected among object surfaces in isolation wards including the clean area, the semi-contaminated area, and the contaminated area. Siegel et al. reported that medical ventilators might generate respiratory aerosols that have been associated with an increased risk of occupationally acquired infection among healthcare personnel (Siegel et al., 2007) . We also detected the object surfaces such as bed rails and nightstands surrounding the COVID-19 patients with or without mechanical ventilation. The two patients' respiratory specimens were both positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA, while the stool specimen of patient A with mechanical ventilation was positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA but that of patient B without mechanical ventilation was negative. The object surfaces closely surrounding the two patients with or without mechanical ventilation were all negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. The sampling time was about 4 h after objects disinfection with 1000 mg/L chlorine containing disinfectant. It indicated that the current disinfection measure was effective in isolation wards in hospital. The negative SARS-COV-2 RNA results of the objects surfaces such as door handles, PDA and gloves of staffs also suggested the effectiveness of the high hand hygiene compliance of staffs in isolation wards. Also, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was not detected among front surface of N95 masks of staffs in isolation wards. It also indicated that our staffs with PPE in the transformed isolation wards with current disinfection measure were in low risk of infection. In this study all the respiratory specimens of staffs in the isolation wards were negative. Since SARS-CoV-2 RNA was also detected in the stool specimen of patients with COVID-19 in previous reports (Yeo et al., 2020; Young et al., 2020) , SARS-CoV-2 RNA was also detected in sewage in our study. For sufficient disinfection of SARS-CoV-2, preprocessing disinfection equipment were added before the sewage drained into the last disinfection pool. Though the sewage samples from the inlet of preprocessing disinfection equipment were positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA and the sample from the outlet of preprocessing disinfection was weakly positive, the sewage sample from the final outlet of the last disinfection pool was negative. In order to identify the viability of the SARS-CoV-2, viral culture was done among these sewage from various points. All of the sewage samples from various points were negative for viral culture. This finding also indicated that the sewage drained from the hospital could not lead to transmission of the SARS-CoV-2.",
