The causes of the emergence of infectious diseases are found in a complex web of determinants that facilitate the passage of infections through and across species. Health security responses must go beyond surveillance and early warning systems to address the ecosystem and the interaction between humans and animals. The proximity of domestic animals to and their interactions with both wild animals and humans are good examples of issues that need further examination. The free range of animals in human communities have been linked with transmission of H5N1 in fl uenza from infected chickens to humans (Van Kerkhove et al. 2011 ) , and human infections with Escherichia coli 0157 have been associated with contamination of meat (Hussein 2007 ) . Infections in workers at slaughterhouses have been shown to occur when domestic animals-infected with microbes from wild animal reservoirsinfect humans involved in their processing. For example, processing of domesticated pigs thought to have been infected with the Ebola Reston virus from its bat reservoir, resulted in infection of slaughterhouse workers and some of the farmers raising these pigs ( http://www.who.int/csr/don/2009_02_03/en/ ).

These shifts in rainfall patterns caused high levels of rainfall in semiarid areas where widespread fl ooding led to the emergence of a larger than usual number of mosquitoes that transmit various types of infection including Rift Valley Fever-a viral disease carried by cattle and other ruminant animals that infects humans, often with a fatal outcome (Anyamba et al. 2001 (Anyamba et al. , 2009 ) . Inadequacy of routine veterinary vaccination in the 1990s against Rift Valley Fever had left large numbers of cattle unvaccinated, and when animals and humans were forced to live closer together on remaining non-fl ooded plains, humans became infected with the virus that was then easily passed from cattle to humans by the higher number of mosquitoes.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 530, "end": 555, "text": "(Nicholson and Kim 1997 )", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 911, "end": 931, "text": "(Anyamba et al. 2001", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 932, "end": 954, "text": "(Anyamba et al. , 2009", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Societal Health Security: Threats and Responses"}, {"text": "Prevailing approaches to the containment of outbreaks caused by emerging infections are often reactive-identifying the infection in humans, then determining the animal source and making efforts to contain infection at both the animal source and in humans.

The phytosanitary conferences of the nineteenth century, where risks to health from infectious disease were addressed alongside risks to trade, were initial multilateral attempts to prevent international spread of infections by increasing measures at borders to prevent the importation and/or breeding of infected animal and insect vectors (Aginam 2002 ) . Newer regimes such as the International Health Regulations (WHO 2005 ) (IHR) have been developed to serve as a safety net when national detection and containment activities have not stopped disease where and when it occurs.

Health sector investments are viewed by some as a bridge to peace; a form of diplomacy aimed to build trust between communities and actors.

NCDs, on the other hand, represent a higher burden of disease at the global level across all ages, but they are often viewed as too indirect, or their emergence too slow, to be viewed within the reactive politics that tend to dominate security discussions.
