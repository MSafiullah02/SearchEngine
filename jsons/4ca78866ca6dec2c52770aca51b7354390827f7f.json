In the ganglion, the HSV-stained neurons and satelhe cells rapidly increased in number on day 4 PI and decreased on day 6 PI, and stained cells were no longer detected on day 8 PI, as already reported [12] . In the trigeminal root, HSV immunoreactivity was observed in some glial cells in the CNS part of the TREZ on day 4 PI (Fig 2) . Most of the HSV-stained glial cells were morphologically normal. There was no inflammatory cell infiltration around these HSV-stained glial cells. Immunostaining of GFAP, MBP, and Po was generally normal. O n day 6 PI, the HSV-stained glial cells increased in number. The distribution of infected cells was restricted to the medial aspect of the CNS part of the root extending from the PNS-CNS transitional zone to the junction of the pons (Fig 3) . In the lesions, many HSV-stained glial cells were destroyed to small fragments or debris. With double immunostaining, most HSV-stained cells or their fragments were also stained with anti-GFAP serum (Fig 4) . Most of the astrocytes, doubly stained with GFAP and HSV antiserum, were degenerating within such a restricted area. Therefore, the lesion was observed as an area lacking in GFAP immunoreactivity (Fig 5) . In contrast to the remarkable changes in the astrocytes, the CNS and PNS myelinated fibers were immunocytochemically or morphologically normal, except for a few CNS fibers with an altered immunoreactivity near the infiltrating mononuclear cells (see Fig 5) . O n day 8 PI, CNS myelinated fibers began to change, both immunocytochemically and morphologically in the area where GFAP staining was completely lacking. Here, the HSV-stained glial cells were no longer observed in the lesion. O n day 10 PI, an active destruction of CNS myelin was apparent and an area lacking in MBP immunostaining was evident. Interestingly, the extent of the demyelinated lesions was similar to the area where the GFAP immunostaining was lacking and the demyelination never extended beyond the area lacking GFAP ",

Alteration or loss of MBP immunoreactivity was observed in the degenerating myelin sheaths. MBPstained myelin debris or macrophages containing MBP-stained materials were numerous, yet astrocytes were intact immunocytochemically and morphologically, even near infiltrating mononuclear cells or macrophages. O n the contrary, the GFAP-stained astrocytes were increased in number and immunoreactivity in the surrounding lesions compared with findings in the control rat CNS or nonneurological control brains.

There is rapid lysis of astrocytes as shown by focal areas in which GFAP immunostaining is completely lost by 6 days after HSV inoculation. Loss of MBP immunostaining indicating demyelination begins just after this extensive lysis of astrocytes, and the area of demyelination as defined by loss of MBP immunostaining is strictly confined to the area of astrocyte destruction as shown by loss of GFAP immunostaining. In contrast, we have found in lesions of acute MS and in early lesions of PML and EAE that there are no degenerative changes in astrocytes, morphologically or immunocytochemically; but we did observe reactive astrocytes or astrocytosis in these lesions. Therefore, it is likely that the early loss of astrocytes is characteristic of HSV-induced demyelination and not other demyelinating lesions.",

The astrocyte also plays an immunological role for presenting antigen to T lymphocytes {29]. They express major histocompatibility complex class 1 antigen on their surface and would be targets for class I-restricted cytolytic T lymphocytes [30}. In addition, recent experimental studies have suggested the requirement of astrocytes for regeneration of CNS myelin {31-337.",

Neither the temporal sequence of astrocyte loss preceding demyelination nor the correspondence in areas of astrocyte destruction and demyelination, however, prove a cause and effect relation. It has been shown that HSV infection in oligodendroglia follows a longer time course and there is relative preservation of oligo-dendroglia at the time of extensive astrocyte loss and onset of destruction of myelin lamellae [1, 251, but we cannot exclude oligodendroglia damage as a cause of the demyelination. More detailed study of HSV-1 infection in oligodendroglia is needed to help determine the significance of the early astrocyte loss in this model.",

There is controversy concerning the mechanism of HSV-associated demyelination. The lesions occur lust on the CNS side of the PNS-CNS junction in the inferior medial aspect of TREZ, corresponding to axons from the cornea in mice inoculated with HSV by the ocular route {Z}. Despite the intra-axonal spread of virus, HSV does not induce PNS demyelination, possibly because HSV infection in Schwann cells, when it does occur, is usually abortive rather than cytolytic 123, 241. Also, it has been suggested that the Schwann cell basal lamina acts a . . a relative barrier, confining virus to the intra-axonal space {251. At the PNS-CNS junction, the Schwann cell basal lamina is lost, Time course ofthe number of herpes simplex ~irzls (HSV)-.stained glial cells (top), changes of glialjibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-stained glial cells (middle), and changes of myelin basic protein (MBFj-stained myelinatedfibers (bottom) demonstrated by a semiquantitative metbod.

On day 8 afer inoculation, HSV-stained cells uJere no longw observed in the lesion where GFAP immunostaining was lacking, but the remaining GFAF-stained astrocyteJ no longer degeneruted. MBP-stained CNS myelin began to degenerate. At 10 and 14 h y~~ CNS myelin sheaths were active4 degenerating within the area lacking in GFAP immunostaining.and although there has never been documentation of viral particles crossing the axonal membrane, this pattern of spread probably occurs because there is productive HSV infection primarily in astrocytes at the entry zone area very soon after HSV inoculation. Townsend and Baringer {26, 2 73 have proposed immune-mediated inflammatory demyelination in this model, based on the finding of a decrease in the extent of demyelin-",

The contradictory results could be related to differences in the dose and time of cyclophosphamide treatment; differences in virus strain, inoculum, and route of inoculation; and differences in the outbred strains of mice.Both inflammatory and direct viral cytolytic demyelination may be operative in this model.The irnmunohistochemical techniques used in the present study cannot settle the disagreement over the relative importance of inflammatory versus viral cytolytic demyelination in this model. Our study using MBP immunostaining confirmed the location and time course of CNS demyelination described by light and electronmicroscopy [l, 27.
