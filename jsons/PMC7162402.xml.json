            "text": "Viral entry relies on a fine interplay between a viral particle and a host cell. This process is initiated by binding to an attachment factor present at the plasma membrane of target cells, which helps to concentrate virions on the cell surface. After this initial step, the viral particle interacts with one or several specific receptor(s), which actively promote virus entry by inducing conformational changes of the viral particle and/or by activating signalling pathways or internalization of the virion. A number of cell surface components exploited by viruses have now been identified (reviewed in Grove and Marsh, 2011). Although many viruses use a single specific receptor (i.e. Poliovirus and human Rhinovirus 2), several viruses exploit more than one molecular species as receptors, each with equivalent roles [i.e. angiotensin\u2010converting enzyme (ACE) or liver\u2010SIGN (L\u2010SIGN) for SARS coronavirus]. However, other viruses require multiple cell surface components, each of which is essential. One of the best examples of this kind of viruses is the Hepatitis C Virus (HCV).",

            "text": "HCV entry into hepatocytes is a multistep process involving viral envelope glycoproteins as well as several cellular attachment and entry factors. After attachment to the host cell, a complex process occurs in which the virion interacts with a series of cellular entry factors, including the tetraspanin CD81 (Pileri et al., 1998), the scavenger receptor type B class I (SRB1) (Scarselli et al., 2002), two tight junction proteins, claudin\u20101 (CLDN\u20101) (Evans et al., 2007) and occludin (Ploss et al., 2009) and additional host factors (Lupberger et al., 2011; Sainz et al., 2012). HCV entry is regulated by receptor tyrosine kinases including EGFR (Lupberger et al., 2011). Among these entry factors, CD81 plays a major role in HCV entry (reviewed in Dubuisson et al., 2008; Farquhar et al., 2011). Indeed, through its large extracellular loop (LEL), CD81 is involved in a direct interaction with the E2 envelope glycoprotein exposed at the surface of HCV virion. Numerous studies have shown that cell susceptibility to HCV infection is closely related to the CD81 expression level. In addition, CD81 associates with CLDN\u20101 to form co\u2010receptor complexes that are critical for HCV entry (Harris et al., 2008, 2010; Krieger et al., 2010). It is believed that the engagement of CD81 activates Rho GTPase and MAPK signalling cascades (Brazzoli et al., 2008). Although MAPK pathway is likely important for as yet unidentified post\u2010entry events, CD81\u2010triggered Rho GTPase signalling probably induces actin remodelling, allowing lateral movement of CD81 necessary for HCV entry (Brazzoli et al., 2008).",

            "text": "CD81 belongs to the tetraspanin family whose members have a strong propensity to multimerize and interact with numerous partner proteins forming scaffolds in membranes, recruiting or excluding specific proteins involved in particular cellular processes (reviewed in Charrin et al., 2009a). The precise mechanisms of interaction within and outside these clusters called tetraspanin\u2010enriched microdomains (TEMs) or tetraspanin webs is still poorly understood. However, from high\u2010resolution fluorescence microscopy techniques, we now know that tetraspanins are distributed along the whole cell surface with a higher concentration in dot\u2010like areas called tetraspanin\u2010enriched areas (TEAs). These TEAs are stable platforms in position and shape but in permanent exchange with the rest of the membrane, indicating that inside the tetraspanin web, protein\u2013protein interactions are transient and highly dynamic (Barreiro et al., 2008; Espenel et al., 2008). In addition, cellular lipids such as cholesterol, glycosphingolipids and palmitic acid seem to play an important role in interactions between tetraspanins and their partners and therefore in building the tetraspanin web (Charrin et al., 2009a).",

            "text": "The direct interaction between tetraspanins and their partner proteins can result in the modulation of their functions. For instance, CD81 functions in cellular processes and infectious diseases can be affected by the association with proteins of the EWI family whose members have a single transmembrane domain and several extracellular Ig\u2010domains with a conserved EWI motif, as well as a very short cytosolic tail (Stipp et al., 2001). Indeed, EWI\u20102 modulates cellular migration (Stipp et al., 2003; Zhang et al., 2003; Sala\u2010Vald\u00e9s et al., 2006) and EWI\u2010F/CD9P\u20101 inhibits Plasmodium infection (Charrin et al., 2009b). A few years ago, we have identified EWI\u20102wint, a cleavage product of EWI\u20102 in which the first of the four extracellular Ig\u2010domains is cleaved off (Rocha\u2010Perugini et al., 2008). This shorter protein forming heterodimers with EWI\u20102 (Montpellier et al., 2011) still interacts with CD81 and, can be found in most cell lines expressing EWI\u20102 but not in hepatocytes. Importantly, in contrast to full\u2010length EWI\u20102, EWI\u20102wint inhibits HCV infection by inhibiting viral entry (Rocha\u2010Perugini et al., 2008). In addition to the presence of specific entry factors in the hepatocytes, the lack of this specific inhibitor may contribute to the hepatotropism of HCV. Although determinants for the interaction of EWI\u20102/EWI\u20102wint and CD81 have been recently identified (Montpellier et al., 2011), the mechanism by which EWI\u20102wint blocks HCV entry has remained elusive.",

However, HCV entry is believed to be mediated through the formation of a tightly orchestrated HCV\u2010entry factor complex at the plasma membrane, but for which interaction kinetics need to be defined. Since the mobility is a critical determinant for the interaction capabilities and for the functions of membrane proteins, we sought to determine the impact of EWI\u20102wint on CD81 membrane dynamics. By combining biochemistry experiments and single\u2010molecule microscopy experiments, we demonstrated that a change in membrane dynamics and partitioning of CD81 occurs in the presence of EWI\u20102wint, which affects cell\u2010free transmission of HCV. Together, our results indicate that HCV likely exploits the dynamic properties of CD81 to enter into its target cells.",

We took advantage of these permissive cells expressing mCD81 and the previously described MT81/MT81w monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) (Silvie et al., 2006) to analyse the role of tetraspanin web\u2010associated CD81 in HCV infection. Indeed, whereas MT81 mAb recognizes all CD81 molecules, MT81w antibody only recognizes a fraction of mCD81 associated with the tetraspanin web or at least CD81 engaged in protein clusters enriched in cholesterol. Although MT81 was fully neutralizing, HCV infection was poorly inhibited by MT81w, suggesting that only a fraction of CD81 is preferentially used for the virus entry (Rocha\u2010Perugini et al., 2009). Based on these data, we made the hypothesis that EWI\u20102wint might inhibit HCV entry by modifying the organization of CD81 at the plasma membrane.",

            "text": "In order to test this hypothesis, we generated Huh\u20107w7 clones expressing mCD81 in combination with EWI\u20102 or EWI\u20102wint and used the MT81w mAb to probe modifications of CD81 organization. EWI\u20102 is endogenously expressed in hepatoma cells but its cleavage does not naturally occur preventing EWI\u20102wint production, as previously described (Rocha\u2010Perugini et al., 2008). In addition, direct expression of EWI\u20102wint sequence leads to the production of an unstable protein in these cells. To circumvent these technical difficulties, we used a modified EWI\u20102 protein that contains a furin cleavage site (EWI\u20102Fur), directly upstream of the first EWI\u20102wint residue, leading to the production of EWI\u20102wint in virtually all cell lines (Fig. 1A) (Rocha\u2010Perugini et al., 2008). We generated Huh\u20107w7 cells stably expressing mCD81 in combination with either the parental EWI\u20102 protein (Huh\u20107w7/mCD81/EWI\u20102), or the cleavage\u2010competent EWI\u20102Fur construct (Huh\u20107w7/mCD81/EWI\u20102wint) or the empty vector (Huh\u20107w7/mCD81/pcDNA3.1) (Fig. 1B). Protein expression in each cell line was controlled by flow cytometry (data not shown) and immunoprecipitation (IP) of cell surface biotinylated lysates (Fig. 1B). Each of the ectopic EWI proteins was correctly expressed, as controlled by direct IP with a mAb directed against a C\u2010terminally expressed FLAG tag. As shown by co\u2010IP with mCD81, in addition to endogenous EWI\u20102 protein (EWI\u20102 endo), ectopically expressed EWI\u20102 and EWI\u20102wint proteins interacted with mCD81, in MT81 and MT81w IPs. The conservation of an interaction between human EWI\u20102/EWI\u20102wint proteins and murine CD81 was expected since the regions involved in protein\u2013protein contact between these two proteins are well conserved (Montpellier et al., 2011). The cell lines were next used to generate cell clones for which expression of ectopic EWI proteins was controlled (data not shown). These cell clones were infected with infectious HCV particles produced in cell culture (HCVcc) (Lindenbach et al., 2005; Wakita et al., 2005; Zhong et al., 2005), which represent the most relevant tool to study HCV life cycle. We used JFH1\u2010based Renilla luciferase (R\u2010Luc) reporter HCVcc (JFH1/CSN6A4/5\u2032C19Rluc2AUbi), as described previously (Delgrange et al., 2007; Rocha\u2010Perugini et al., 2008; Goueslain et al., 2010). Interestingly, HCV infection levels were significantly reduced in cell clones producing EWI\u20102wint (Fig. 1C), as compared with cells expressing the empty vector (pcDNA3.1) or overexpressing EWI\u20102 (EWI\u20102). Altogether these results strongly suggest that EWI\u20102wint interacts with mCD81 and inhibits HCV infection mediated by the murine receptor. It should be noted that EWI\u20102wint expression does not affect expression levels of mCD81 and other entry factors (data not shown).",

Interestingly, as shown for one representative cell clone, cells expressing EWI\u20102wint exhibited a stronger staining with MT81w, indicating that EWI\u20102wint modifies CD81 membrane organization, probably by increasing the association of CD81 with the tetraspanin web.

Moreover, we demonstrated that, if palmitoylation of two juxtamembranous cysteines is conserved, the cytosolic tail of EWI\u20102/EWI\u20102wint, which is involved in interactions with the actin cytoskeleton (Sala\u2010Vald\u00e9s et al., 2006), can be replaced by that of MHC II without affecting their biological function (Qcc) (Montpellier et al., 2011). Thus, in our study, we generated Huh\u20107 cell clones stably expressing either the parental EWI\u20102 protein (Huh\u20107/EWI\u20102), or the cleavage\u2010competent EWI\u20102Fur construct (Huh\u20107/EWI\u20102wint clones 1, 2 and 3), or the EWI\u20102Fur protein in which residues that are essential for the interaction with CD81 were mutated (Huh\u20107/LAL) (Montpellier et al., 2011), or the EWI\u20102Fur protein in which the cytosolic tail was replaced but the two palmitoylatable cysteines conserved (Huh\u20107/Qcc) or cells expressing the empty vector (Huh\u20107/pcDNA3.1) (Fig. 2A). Protein expression in each clone was controlled by flow cytometry (data not shown) and immunoprecipitation of cell surface biotinylated lysates (Fig. 2B). Each of the ectopic EWI\u20102 proteins was correctly expressed, as controlled by direct immunoprecipitation with a mAb directed against a C\u2010terminally expressed FLAG tag (Fig. 2B, left panel) or a mAb directed against an N\u2010terminally expressed HA tag (Fig. 2B, right panel). As shown by co\u2010immunoprecipitation with CD81, in addition to endogenous EWI\u20102 protein (EWI\u20102 endo), ectopically expressed EWI\u20102 and EWI\u20102wint proteins interacted with CD81, whereas LAL related proteins did not. It should be noted that, although Qcc related proteins barely co\u2010precipitate with CD81, the interaction occurs between these molecules, as previously demonstrated (Montpellier et al., 2011). Cells were next infected with infectious HCVcc particles (JFH\u20101/CSN6A4) and infection levels were evaluated by flow cytometry using a mAb directed against the non\u2010structural protein 5 (NS5) (Fig. 2C). The proportion of infected cells was reduced in cells producing EWI\u20102wint (EWI\u20102wint 1, 2 and 3) whereas it remained unmodified in cells overexpressing EWI\u20102 (EWI\u20102) or EWI\u20102 proteins that no longer interact with CD81 (LAL), as previously described (Montpellier et al., 2011). The proportion of infected cells was also reduced in cells expressing the Qcc protein, which still interacts with CD81 (Qcc). It should be noted that EWI\u20102wint expression does not affect expression levels of CD81 and other entry factors (Rocha\u2010Perugini et al., 2008; Montpellier et al., 2011). In addition, levels of CD81 expression at the cell surface were equivalent for all the clones (data not shown).",

As controls, we also analysed the distribution of the tetraspanin CD9 and of CD46, a type I membrane protein excluded from rafts and TEMs (Espenel et al., 2008). CD81, CD9 and CD46 molecules were labelled with Atto647N\u2010labelled Fab fragments of TS81, SYB\u20101 and 11C5 mAbs, respectively, as previously described (Espenel et al., 2008). CD81 molecules, as well as their counterparts CD9, were distributed along the whole cell surface, with a higher concentration in dot\u2010like areas (Fig. 3 and Fig. S1). These structures have been described as TEAs in which tetraspanins are confined but from which they can also escape and freely diffuse in the plasma membrane (Espenel et al., 2008). As shown in Fig. 3 and Fig. S1, no major change in the distribution of CD81, as well as that of CD9 and CD46, was observed in cell clones expressing or lacking EWI\u20102wint, indicating that this protein does not affect the global distribution of membrane proteins expressed at the plasma membrane.",

            "text": "Dynamics and partitioning of CD81 were next investigated using single\u2010molecule tracking (SMT), a technique based on the labelling of a low number of molecules allowing individual molecules to be optically isolated and their position accurately determined. With this technique, the position of proteins was determined frame by frame and their trajectories reconstructed. For this purpose, Huh\u20107 cell clones were plated on collagen I\u2010coated glass coverslips to allow attachment and cell spreading. Single CD81 molecules were tracked using Atto647N\u2010labelled Fab fragments of TS81 mAb. For each cell clone, the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) of at least 500 individual CD81 molecules (10\u201320 trajectories per cell) was calculated using a linear fit to the mean squared displacement (MSD) versus time plots for the first three points of the curve (Michalet, 2010) and their distribution displayed with a scatter plot. We first analysed the dynamics of CD81 in Huh\u20107/pcDNA3.1 and Huh\u20107/EWI\u20102 cells for which we found no difference (data not shown). Since expressing EWI\u20102wint in Huh\u20107 cells required a mutated form of EWI\u20102 to be overexpressed, we considered that cells overexpressing the parental EWI\u20102 protein (Huh\u20107/EWI\u20102) were a better control than unmodified Huh\u20107 cells (Huh\u20107/pcDNA3.1). As shown in the scatter plot in Fig. 4A in which each trajectory is represented by a dot, CD81 molecules are distributed in three subpopulations (EWI\u20102): (i) a subpopulation characterized by the highest ADC, (ii) a subpopulation characterized by the lowest ADC and (iii) a major subpopulation with intermediate ADC. Strikingly, in cell clones expressing EWI\u20102wint (EWI\u20102wint 1 and EWI\u20102wint 2), a highly significant global shift of CD81 trajectories was observed with an increase of the subpopulation 2 with a low ADC at the expense of the subpopulation 1 with a high ADC. This effect was characterized by a decrease of the mean value of CD81 ADC in EWI\u20102wint 1 (1 \u00d7 10\u22122 \u03bcm2 s\u22121) and EWI\u20102wint 2 (1.1 \u00d7 10\u22122 \u03bcm2 s\u22121) cells, as compared with EWI\u20102 cells (3.3 \u00d7 10\u22122 \u03bcm2 s\u22121) (Table 1). These results indicate that EWI\u20102wint induces a global change of the behaviour of CD81 molecules in the plasma membrane. Interestingly, CD81 trajectories in LAL cells (in which EWI\u20102wint no longer interacts with CD81) were distributed similarly to those of EWI\u20102 cells demonstrating the specificity of the observed effect and that EWI\u20102wint needs to interact with CD81 to alter its diffusion. We next analysed the distribution of CD81 trajectories in cells expressing the mutant Qcc which still interacts with CD81 but in which the cytosolic tail of EWI\u20102/EWI\u20102wint was replaced by that of MHC II. As in EWI\u20102wint 1 and EWI\u20102wint 2 cells, however at a lesser extent, a global shift of CD81 trajectories towards slower trajectories was seen in Qcc cells. Since the cytosolic tail of EWI proteins interacts with the actin cytoskeleton (Sala\u2010Vald\u00e9s et al., 2006), our results indicate that differences in the diffusion of CD81 in cells expressing EWI\u20102wint cannot be attributed to its differential anchorage to the actin cytoskeleton.",

For this purpose, we generated CHO cell lines expressing the human CD81 alone (CHO/CD81/pcDNA3.1), or in combination with either a non\u2010cleavable EWI\u20102 construct (CHO/CD81/EWI\u20102) or a wild\u2010type EWI\u20102 construct that leads to the production of EWI\u20102 and EWI\u20102wint proteins in CHO cells, which both interact with CD81 (CHO/CD81/EWI\u20102wint) (Rocha\u2010Perugini et al., 2008; Montpellier et al., 2011), as shown in Fig. S3. Although the distribution of CD81 trajectories in CHO cells was rather different from that in Huh\u20107 cells, we found again a statistically significant shift of CD81 trajectories towards slower trajectories (Fig. 4C) in presence of EWI\u20102wint.

            "text": "The different modes of diffusion of CD81 molecules were next evaluated by the analysis of MSD versus time plots of the trajectories of individual molecules (for details see the data analysis section in Experimental procedures) in each cell clone. As described for CD9 (Espenel et al., 2008) three different diffusion modes were observed for CD81 trajectories in EWI\u20102\u2010expressing cells (Fig. 5A and B and Table 2): (i) pure Brownian diffusion (40% of total trajectories) characterized by an ADC mean value of 6.49 \u00d7 10\u22122 \u03bcm2 s\u22121, (ii) pure confined or restricted diffusion (50% of total trajectories) characterized by a lower ADC mean value of 0.94 \u00d7 10\u22122 \u03bcm2 s\u22121, and (iii) diffusion with different combinations of Brownian and confined modes referred to as \u2018Mixed trajectories\u2019 (9% of total trajectories). Importantly, the proportion of Brownian trajectories was reduced from 40% to 23\u201326% of the total trajectories in EWI\u20102wint 1 and EWI\u20102wint 2 cells (Fig. 5B). This effect was characterized by an increase of confined and mixed trajectories. In addition to the increase in confinement, the ADC mean value of Brownian trajectories was 2.4\u2010 and 3.1\u2010fold reduced in EWI\u20102wint 1 and EWI\u20102wint 2 cells as compared with EWI\u20102 cells respectively (Table 2 and Fig. 5C). The effect of EWI\u20102wint on CD81 diffusion can be easily observed by the eye on the overlapping of all the tracked molecules with CD81 ensemble labelling as shown in Fig. 5A. In addition, the analysis of the distribution of Brownian and confined CD81 trajectories (Fig. 5C and D) both showed a highly significant shift of trajectories towards slower diffusion. Indeed, a majority of Brownian proteins diffused more slowly than 0.1 \u03bcm2 s\u22121 at the expense of the highly mobile fraction in EWI\u20102wint\u2010expressing cells. Moreover, the emergence of a subpopulation with a very low ADC (approximately 0.2 \u00d7 10\u22122 \u03bcm2 s\u22121) was observed in confined trajectories in EWI\u20102wint cells (Fig. 5D, arrows). As shown in Fig. 5B, CD81 molecules could also be transiently confined (mixed trajectories) and, in order to determine whether EWI\u20102wint affects the escape of CD81 molecules from confined areas, we calculated the dwell time of CD81 molecules in confined areas for each cell clone. Interestingly, CD81 molecules were trapped significantly longer in confined areas in cells expressing EWI\u20102wint than in control cells with a dwell time of 4.8 s (EWI\u20102wint 1)/4.6 s (EWI\u20102wint 2) versus 3.4 s (EWI\u20102) (Table 2). Interestingly, the effect of EWI\u20102wint mainly depends on its interaction with CD81 since the dynamic behaviour in terms of ADC mean values, diffusion modes and dwell times of CD81 was not significantly modulated in cells expressing LAL as compared with EWI\u20102 cells (Fig. 5). Although less pronounced, the behaviour of CD81 trajectories in Qcc\u2010expressing cells was similar to that in EWI\u20102wint cells (Fig. 5), indicating that the observed effects on the diffusion of CD81 in cells expressing EWI\u20102wint cannot be attributed to a difference in its anchorage to the actin cytoskeleton by its cytosolic tail.",

No exchange with the rest of the membrane was observed for these confinement areas. We therefore compared CD81 trajectories with the ensemble distribution of CD9 and CD46 (Fig. 6A and B). To do so, overlapping of CD81 trajectories with ensemble CD9 and CD46 labelling was performed. In all cell clones, about 40% of CD81 confinement areas colocalized with CD9\u2010enriched areas whereas less than 5% were colocalized with CD46. Although somewhat higher, we did not find any significant increase of colocalization of CD81 with CD9 in cells expressing EWI\u20102wint. In contrast, the proportion of CD81 trajectories overlapping CD81\u2010enriched areas was significantly increased in cells expressing EWI\u20102wint, as compared with EWI\u20102 cells (Fig. 6D). No significant change was observed for cells expressing the LAL mutant whereas an intermediate effect was observed for the Qcc mutant. We also analysed the colocalization of CD81 with EWI\u20102/EWI\u20102wint proteins (Fig. 6C). Interestingly, we found an increase of the colocalization of CD81 with EWI proteins in cells expressing EWI\u20102wint, indicating that EWI\u20102wint or at least EWI\u20102/EWI\u20102wint heterodimers probably interact more strongly with CD81 than parental EWI\u20102 proteins.",

Based on this, we constructed mCD81/CD82 chimeras in which the TM3 (Fig. 8A; mTM3) or the TM4 (Fig. 8A; mTM4) of mCD81 was replaced by the corresponding domain of human CD82. Huh\u20107w7 cells that no longer express hCD81 were transfected with plasmids encoding mCD81, mTM3, mTM4 or the empty vector. The oligomerization status of mCD81 was next analysed by Western blotting with the MT81 antibody. In addition to the \u2248 25 kDa major band corresponding to the monomeric form of CD81, an additional band of \u2248 40 kDa was seen in cells expressing the mTM3 chimera (Fig. 8B). In cells expressing the mTM4 chimera, several other additional bands (\u2248 60/70 kDa and \u2248 90 kDa) were detected (Fig. 8B). The presence of all these additional bands, which likely correspond to dimeric, trimeric and tetrameric forms of CD81 (Yang et al., 2006) indicate that the replacement in mCD81 of TM3 or TM4 by the corresponding region of CD82 increases the homo\u2010oligomerization of CD81. It has to be noted that similar results were obtained in CHO cells (data not shown). We then took advantage of these chimeras to analyse whether the increase of CD81 oligomers modulates the recognition by the MT81w mAb. Huh\u20107w7 cells expressing mCD81, mTM3 or mTM4 were stained with MT81 and MT81w mAbs and analysed by flow cytometry (Fig. 8C). It has to be noted that cells expressing mCD81, mTM3 or mTM4 were equally stained with MT81 mAb, indicating transmembrane domain exchanges in chimeras did not affect their cell surface expression, as compared with unmodified mCD81. However, to avoid any bias of the CD81 expression level, the modulation of the recognition by MT81w was evaluated by the MT81w/MT81 ratio. Interestingly, the recognition by MT81w was twice more efficient in cells expressing the mTM4 chimera for which CD81 homo\u2010oligomerization is the strongest.",

Indeed, HCV is transmitted in the presence of mAbs or patient\u2010derived antibodies that are able to neutralize virus\u2010free infectivity (Timpe et al., 2008; Brimacombe et al., 2011). Since cell\u2010to\u2010cell transmission has been suggested to be a major route of transmission for HCV (Brimacombe et al., 2011), we next analysed the effect of EWI\u20102wint on this process. Briefly, HCV\u2010infected Huh\u20107 cells were labelled with 5\u2010chloromethylfluorescein diacetate (CMFDA) and co\u2010cultured with the na\u00efve target cells expressing or lacking EWI\u20102/EWI\u20102wint proteins. Co\u2010cultures were performed in the presence and in absence of neutralizing antibodies (3\u201011 anti\u2010E2 mAb) to analyse cell\u2010to\u2010cell and total transmission respectively. After 24 h of co\u2010culture, de novo transmission events were determined by staining for HCV NS5 and they were quantified by flow cytometry. It is worth noting that no HCV transmission occurred in Huh\u20107w7 cells that do not express CD81, in agreement with this entry factor being essential to both cell\u2010free and cell\u2010to\u2010cell transmission. As demonstrated by our data in Fig. 9A, EWI\u20102wint expression has no significant effect on HCV cell\u2010to\u2010cell transmission. To support this claim, we performed another assay in which the cell seeding density was lowered or increased to reduce or increase cell\u2013cell contacts, as compared with standard cell seeding density (medium). Cells seeded at different densities were infected with HCVcc and infection levels were evaluated by flow cytometry at 48 h post infection (Fig. 9B). The more the cells were confluent at the time of infection, the less they were infected. In contrast, subconfluent cells were better infected. This is probably due to the differences in multiplicities of infection for each condition. Interestingly, this effect was not observed in cells expressing EWI\u20102wint, it was even somewhat the opposite. When compared with control cell lines, the effect of EWI\u20102wint on HCV infection was less pronounced in cells seeded at high density, indicating that HCV infection was less inhibited by EWI\u20102wint in the presence of numerous cell\u2010to\u2010cell contacts. In contrast, EWI\u20102wint highly reduced HCV infection in subconfluent cells, as compared with control cells. Together, these results demonstrate that EWI\u20102wint does not inhibit cell\u2010to\u2010cell transmission of HCV.",

Here, we especially focused on CD81 behaviour in cells expressing EWI\u20102, one of the primary partners of CD81 (Stipp et al., 2001; Charrin et al., 2003a), or EWI\u20102wint, a truncated form of EWI\u20102 that inhibits HCV entry (Rocha\u2010Perugini et al., 2008). Interestingly, membrane dynamics of CD81 was largely reduced upon EWI\u20102wint expression. We demonstrated that the lower ADC mean value of CD81 is explained by two principal effects of EWI\u20102wint expression. First, the number of pure confinement largely increased, suggesting that CD81 molecules are trapped within membrane domains. Ensemble labelling revealed that these domains are often enriched in CD81 and in EWI molecules, suggesting that these domains likely correspond to TEAs. Second, the diffusion rate of CD81 Brownian molecules significantly decreased when EWI\u20102wint was expressed. This result can be explained by the fact that CD81 diffuses in larger complexes that can be formed thanks to EWI\u20102wint interacting more strongly with CD81. Indeed, although the diffusion of membrane proteins can be modulated by the lipidic composition of plasma membrane or the interaction with the membrane cytoskeleton, it is currently accepted that the diffusion coefficient of a molecule is dependent on its molecular weight (Saffman and Delbruck, 1975; Gambin et al., 2006). In our study, although we did not analyse the effect of EWI\u20102wint on the membrane lipid composition, our data suggest that CD81 diffusion is modulated by protein\u2013protein interactions. Indeed, we showed that the observed effects on the diffusion of CD81 molecules in cells expressing EWI\u20102wint were not related to anchorage to the actin cytoskeleton by its cytosolic tail. Our colocalization studies indicated that EWI\u20102wint or at least EWI\u20102/EWI\u20102wint heterodimers probably interact more strongly with CD81. In addition, high\u2010molecular\u2010weight complexes enriched in CD81 were detected in cells expressing EWI\u20102wint. These complexes likely correspond to the subpopulation of CD81 molecules with a very low diffusion coefficient, which have been identified in cells expressing EWI\u20102wint.",

Although we did not perform quantitative analyses of the interaction between CD81 and CLDN1, we quantified the level of colocalization of these two HCV entry factors and found a significant increase in the presence of EWI\u20102wint. This suggests that EWI\u20102wint, by sequestering CD81 in membrane areas, might also sequester CLDN1 and promote CD81\u2013CLDN1 interactions. This also suggests that CD81 and CLDN1 likely interact transiently with each other in TEAs, then dissociate and escape from these areas. In cells expressing EWI\u20102wint, CD81\u2013CLDN1 complexes might be sequestered in TEAs.

            "text": "CD81 forms homodimers (Kitadokoro et al., 2001; Harris et al., 2008), which may promote higher\u2010order oligomeric structures. In 2006, in order to characterize tetraspanin microdomains, Silvie and colleagues generated new anti\u2010mouse CD81 antibodies among them the MT81w mAb (Silvie et al., 2006). They demonstrated that MT81w immunoprecipitates CD81 only from lysates made under detergent conditions preserving tetraspanin\u2013tetraspanin interactions. Moreover, CD9 depletion completely removed the pool of CD81 molecules recognized by MT81w. Based on this, it has been suggested that MT81w specifically recognizes CD81 associated with other tetraspanins (including other CD81 molecules) or at least CD81 proteins interacting with cholesterol that directly interact with tetraspanins (Charrin et al., 2003b). We next took advantage of this tool to analyse the role in HCV infection of CD81 molecules recognized by the MT81w antibody (Rocha\u2010Perugini et al., 2009). We showed that MT81w did not strongly affect HCV infection. Furthermore, cholesterol depletion, which inhibits HCV infection and reduces total cell surface expression of CD81, did not affect recognition by MT81w. In addition, sphingomyelinase treatment, which also reduces HCV infection and cell surface expression of total CD81, raised the number of CD81 molecules recognized by MT81w. We therefore concluded that HCV does not use preferentially CD81 associated with other tetraspanins. In the present study, we used again this antibody in order to define whether EWI\u20102wint promotes a change in CD81 partitioning and dynamics. We found that the proportion of CD81 molecules recognized by MT81w increased upon EWI\u20102wint expression, suggesting that EWI\u20102wint promotes the association of CD81 with other tetraspanins. However, our colocalization studies showed that CD81 was trapped in areas particularly enriched in CD81 and not in CD9, in cells expressing EWI\u20102wint. We also demonstrated that MT81w preferentially stains cells expressing oligomeric forms of CD81 indicating that MT81w likely does not recognize CD81 associated with other tetraspanins but it is rather a low\u2010affinity antibody that better recognizes clusters of CD81. Antibodies with low monovalent affinity are indeed particularly dependent on bivalent binding, and consequently are particularly sensitive to antigen clustering. We can speculate that in depletion experiments made by Silvie and co\u2010workers, depletion of CD9, which shares the same partners as CD81, liberates partner proteins that can then interact with CD81 and thereby impede CD81 homo\u2010oligomerization. Under these conditions, the MT81w will no longer recognize CD81. Our results therefore suggest that MT81w is somehow similar to C9BB, a low\u2010affinity antibody that preferentially recognizes multimerized CD9 (Yang et al., 2006). In accordance with the claim that MT81w is a low\u2010affinity antibody that better recognizes clusters of CD81, we showed that recognition by MT81w was increased following ceramide enrichment (Rocha\u2010Perugini et al., 2009), which is known to induce receptor clustering for many receptor molecules (reviewed in Zhang et al., 2009) essential to initiation and amplification of receptor and stress\u2010mediated signalling in almost all cell types. Since receptor aggregation and trapping in ceramide\u2010enriched microdomains may limit lateral diffusion of membrane proteins, it will be interesting to study in single\u2010molecule microscopy whether CD81 molecules in sphingomyelinase\u2010treated cells behave similarly to those in cells expressing EWI\u20102wint. Thus, our data suggest that MT81w antibody is likely a low\u2010affinity antibody that specifically recognizes CD81\u2010enriched structures, which might be identified as TEAs. Taken together, our results indicate that EWI\u20102wint increased association of CD81 within membrane areas such as TEAs that favours CD81 clustering and which are specifically recognized by the MT81w antibody.",

For example, it has been demonstrated that EWI\u2010F/CD9P\u20101 forms oligomers at the cell surface that are directly associated with the tetraspanins CD9 and CD81 (Andr\u00e9 et al., 2009). EWI\u20102 has also been observed to form protein complexes containing at least two EWI\u20102 molecules (Andr\u00e9 et al., 2009). In addition, EWI\u20102wint is associated with EWI\u20102 in heterodimers that are associated with CD81 and CD9 (Montpellier et al., 2011). We therefore cannot exclude the possibility that EWI\u20102wint needs EWI\u20102 to interact with CD81 and consequently to modulate its partitioning and membrane diffusion.",

Particularly, in the context of the mTM4 chimera, CD81 formed high\u2010molecular\u2010weight complexes that may correspond to dimers, trimers and tetramers. Interestingly, a high\u2010molecular\u2010weight band was seen in cells expressing EWI\u20102wint, suggesting that CD81 forms high\u2010order complexes upon EWI\u20102wint expression. This result was in accordance with our microscopy experiments demonstrating that CD81 molecules were confined in CD81\u2010enriched areas of the plasma membrane. Our previous (Rocha\u2010Perugini et al., 2008; 2009; Montpellier et al., 2011) and present results support the model in which CD81 clusters are deleterious for HCV entry. First, TM3 and TM4 chimeras, which form CD81 oligomers, are not functional in HCV entry. Second, EWI\u20102wint, which promotes CD81 clustering, inhibits HCV infection. Third, the MT81w mAb, for which we showed a stronger affinity for cells expressing EWI\u20102wint or mTM4 chimera, poorly neutralizes HCV infection.",

Since this antibody poorly neutralizes HCV infection, we assume that the CD81 oligomers are not used during HCV entry. From all these data, we can therefore conclude that, by reorganizing CD81 molecules on the cell surface, EWI\u20102wint impedes the interaction between CD81 and E2 envelope glycoproteins. Although additional experiments will be necessary to strengthen this hypothesis, we can assume that the effects of EWI\u20102wint on CD81 membrane diffusion and E2\u2013CD81 binding are probably two inseparable functions.",

            "text": "Enveloped viruses can spread via two distinct routes, either through the cell\u2010free aqueous environment or by remaining cell associated and being passed on by direct cell\u2013cell contact. This latter mode of spread designated as cell\u2010to\u2010cell transmission not only facilitates rapid viral dissemination, but may also promote immune evasion and influence disease (reviewed in Sattentau, 2008). Increasing evidences suggest that cell\u2010to\u2010cell transmission is a major route of transmission for HCV. Indeed, HCV is transmitted in the presence of mAbs and patient\u2010derived antibodies that are able to neutralize virus\u2010free infectivity (Timpe et al., 2008; Brimacombe et al., 2011). In addition, cell\u2010to\u2010cell transfer of virions has been shown to be a feature common to chimeric viruses expressing the structural proteins representing the seven major HCV genotypes (Brimacombe et al., 2011). Although HCV may exploit a contact structure similar to the virological synapse of HIV (Brimacombe et al., 2011) or may use membrane nanotubes, the precise mechanism by which HCV is transmitted from a cell to another cell needs to be elucidated. It has been established that SRB1 and the tight\u2010junction components CLDN1 and occludin are involved in HCV cell\u2010to\u2010cell transmission. So far, the role played by CD81 remains controversial. Indeed, several studies reported HCV cell\u2010to\u2010cell transmission as a CD81\u2010dependent pathway (Russell et al., 2008; Brimacombe et al., 2011), whereas others demonstrated a CD81\u2010independent transmission (Timpe et al., 2008; Witteveldt et al., 2009; Jones et al., 2010). In our study, we found that Huh\u20107w7 cells, which do not express CD81, were resistant to both cell\u2010free and cell\u2010to\u2010cell transmission indicating that CD81 is necessary for both cell\u2010free and cell\u2010to\u2010cell spread of HCV. We showed that EWI\u20102wint inhibits cell\u2010free transmission but not cell\u2010to\u2010cell transmission of HCV. This finding demonstrates that cell\u2010free and cell\u2010to\u2010cell transmissions are driven by different mechanisms. According to the SMT experiments, we could speculate that EWI\u20102wint inhibits cell\u2010free transmission by modulating CD81 membrane diffusion and its clustering and that these processes are not critically involved in cell\u2010to\u2010cell transmission.",
