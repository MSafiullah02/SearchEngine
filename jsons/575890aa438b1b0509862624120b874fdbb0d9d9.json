In the literature there are a number of different approaches that has been developed to evaluate the maintainability of a product but almost each method has been developed in an independent way without leveraging on the existing work and with almost no independent evaluation of the performance of the models. In most of the cases, the models are only validated through a limited set of projects only by the people that propose the specific approach. This paper is a first step towards a different direction focusing on the independent application of the existing models to popular open source projects.",

A software application might fulfils all the traditional requirements and yet be of little use if the cost of maintaining it is too high. For such reason, maintainability has been considered one of the requirements that must be imposed to software products [3] . Several authors have investigated the models and metrics used for the best estimation of maintainability also known as prediction or software maintainability prediction models. Traditional models based on their accuracy of prediction have been represented by Shafiabady et al. [22] . Moreover, an analysis of the evolution of software maintenance models over the four past decades has been introduced by Lenarduzzi et al. [14] . Defining the right tools on code analysis to perform research studies on software maintenance prediction is also a crucial aspect and has received much attention in the last few years [18] . Recent papers [2, 5, 11, 15, 19] have identified tools that are available and can be used to apply maintenance models published in the studies in this area.",

A considerable amount of studies have employed different models and techniques for predicting software maintenance using basic metrics and models: McCall's model in 1976 [20] , Barry Boehm's quality model presented in 1978 [1] , Sneed-Mercy Model in 1985 [23] , Li-Henry Model in 1993 [16] , Marcela Genero Model in 2004 [8] . Later, slightly different techniques were used from simple statistical models such as regression [25] to machine learning [7, 24] , and deep learning [9, 13] . To predict maintainability of software, different metrics have been proposed in literature. Among the large variety of metrics, the most used ones are the OO metrics depth of the inheritance tree (DIT), response for a class (RFC), number of children (NOC), coupling between objects (CBO), lack of cohesion of methods (LCOM), and weighted method per class (WMC) [4] . Other metrics are popular, such as: number of methods (NOM), lines of code (LOC), number of semicolons in a class (SIZE1), number of properties (SIZE2), and CHANGE metrics as dependent variable to predict software maintainability by calculating the changed number of lines in the class during maintenance process [16] . Investigating different primary studies and secondary studies from the literature, we have found out that even if there are a number of different methods to predict maintainability, almost all the studies built their models from scratch and do not extend existing ones.",

It is of high relevance to mention that the value of the average CC has been higher for versions of low MI index in other words for early releases. A slightly different trend follows the LOC metric. For higher values of LOC there is also a higher value for MI and vice versa. We can notice the trend of size metric for each version. with a decrease in CC and an increase in MI. These outputs clearly highlight the fact that a high value of CC means more complexity added to the system which increases the degree of difficulty for the system to be maintained.",

We are going to test hypothesis of possible correlation of LOC, CC with MI and LOC with CC. Since the MI is defined as a function that include LOC and CC as independent variables, we expect that MI is highly correlated to them but we want to investigate how strong is the effect of such variables on the overall values of the MI. We use the same data provided in the initial steps of our work collected with the JHawk tool. To test correlation, we are postulating hypothesis in Table 1 . In overall, correlation claims the strength of a relationship. We use the Cohen definition of correlation [6] where he defined a value less than 0.3 as a weak correlation, 0.3 to 0.5 as medium correlation, and greater than 0.5 as strong correlation. We are interested to understand the strength of such correlation. To measure the strength of relationship in our data variables we use Spearman rank correlation for the reason that it does not assume any linear relation between variables and it does not assume any specific distribution of data. We analyze the data in Python, using a Jupyter Notebook with the stats.py statistical package. We went again through same process described for the analysis of jEdit to collect LOC, MI, and CC metrics, and perform the correlation analysis as reported in Table 2 . As we can notice in Table 2 , the values in red identify significant values. All projects include some significant values except SoundHelix. There is a strong correlation of the LOC metric and MI in JXLS and JTDS and a strong correlation of CC and LOC in jEdit project. Also to be highlighted is the fact that exist strong negative correlations. The not significant results obtained from the SoundHelix project might derive from the fact that it is the project with the least data collected, this could have affected the overall analysis since only 4 versions were analyzed.",
