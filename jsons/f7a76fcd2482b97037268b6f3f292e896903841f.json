Due to this particular novel and highly infectious strain of 6 coronavirus, the rapid community spread and clinical severity of the subsequent respiratory 7 syndrome created a substantial strain on hospitals and healthcare systems around the world. The 8 rapid surge of patients presenting over a small time period for emergent clinical care, admission 9 to the hospital and intensive care units with many requiring mechanically assisted ventilators for 10 respiratory support demonstrated the potential to overwhelm healthcare workers, hospitals and 11 healthcare systems. The purpose of our article is to describe an effective system for re-12 deployment of healthcare supplies, resources and personnel to hospitals within a suburban 13 academic hospital system to optimize the care of COVID patients, while treating orthopaedic 14 patients in an equally ideal setting to maximize their surgical and clinical care. This article will 15 provide a particular focus on the current and future role of a specialty hip and knee hospital and 16 its partnering ambulatory surgery center in the context of an outpatient arthroplasty program. 17 18 93 accepted that an \"urgent\" procedure is a surgery that would increase the risk of permanent 94 impairment or pain if not performed in a timely manner. 95 96 97",

The Indiana University Hip and Knee Center at Saxony 55 Hospital is part of a four hospital regional health network called the Indianapolis Suburban 56 Region (ISR) and the administrative and clinical leadership immediately developed and enacted 57 a plan to preserve PPE and hospital resources to support the appropriate deployment to the 58 frontline caregivers that included emergency room physicians, pulmonologist, anesthesiologists, 59 and critical care physicians and team members.

Patients and 65 staff members are required to use masks during every patient interaction and patients were seen 66 in person only if the patient's clinical condition was deemed urgent. All exam rooms in their 67 entirety were thoroughly cleaned with disinfectant between each and every patient. In addition, 68 like many other institutions in the United States and abroad, virtual interaction with existing and potential patients were initiated using HIPAA compliant software. Virtual clinic visits were 70 offered to follow-up and new patients, who consented to that form of clinical interaction. 71 72 Unique to the outpatient surgery environment, the ambulatory surgery center facilities played a 73 significant and vital role in terms of contributing resources to accommodate the surge of 74 COVID-19 patients. IU Health has a unique and collaborative partnership with Surgical Care 75 Affiliates (SCA). The partnership between the two entities encompasses 14 discrete ambulatory 76 surgery centers (ASC) whose operations are run by Indiana University Health with 77 administrative support from SCA. The 14 IUH ASC's perform approximately 75,000 outpatient 78 surgeries annually and analogous to the main hospitals, the ASCs stopped all elective surgeries 79 on March 17, 2020. Supplies and staff from the ASCs were re-deployed into the hospitals to 80 serve vital roles in the continued healthcare expansion to accept the medially ill patients within 81 the COVID-19 surge. In fact, approximately 85% of extra supplies and equipment needed for the 82 frontline providers in the four ISR hospitals were provided by the ASCs, clearly demonstrating 83 the critical important role that the ASCs played and continue to play in the COVID pandemic 84 response. It is important to recognize the leadership role that ASCs play in the 2020 COVID-19 85 pandemic. SCA is one of many ambulatory surgery center entities in the US who play a vital 86 role in healthcare delivery and were vital in rapidly deploying PPEs, ventilators, supplies, and 87 staff to the various hospitals. In our particular health system, three of the ambulatory surgery 88 centers remained open for urgent ambulatory surgical care. This further supported the healthcare 89 resource conundrum, by performing urgent surgical care for less complex ambulatory procedures 90 in the ASCs which allowed the more medically complex COVID-19 patients to have access to 91 the inpatient hospital system. Some guidelines and publications have been established regarding what constitutes an \"urgent\" procedure within and ASC or outpatient setting.[2] It is generally Our hip and knee arthroplasty program is diligently developing protocols for keeping patients 116 and health care workers safe upon the point in time that we resume elective hip and knee 117",
