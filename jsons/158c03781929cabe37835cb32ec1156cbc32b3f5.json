            "text": "' P ublic Health surveillance is the ongoing systematic collection, analysis and interpretation of health data, closely integrated with the timely dissemination of these data both to those providing the data and to those who can apply the data to control and prevention programs'. 1 Public health surveillance is therefore, closely linked to action as it provides accurate and validated information to local and national health authorities in order that these same authorities can implement appropriate prevention and control measures and health promotion strategies. 2 This definition was set up several decades ago. Since then, the adoption of the revised International Health Regulations in 2005 has implemented new regulations such as national obligations to guarantee a set of core surveillance and response capacities to prevent international spread of disease irrespective of its origin (biological but also chemical or radio-nuclear sources). 3 Furthermore, new diseases have emerged (H1N1pdm09, Middle East Coronavirus), some others have spread dramatically such Ebola virus disease in West Africa. 4 In the context of globalisation, the concept of public health surveillance has evolved to include public health security. 5, 6 Politicians and stakeholders rely upon their public health agencies to be informed in a timely fashion and to be able to respond promptly to all potential health treats that may arise as populations need protection whatever the risk. For public health surveillance, this implies the need to monitor a very large spectrum of all hazards health threats. At the same time, as many public agencies are currently facing budgetary constraints, they must allocate theirs resources as efficiently as possible, as surveillance systems cannot be implemented for all known health threats. The priorities for diseases surveillance need to be reviewed regularly in order to guarantee that the most topical public health issues are consistently tackled and to ensure quality and effectiveness of surveillance. Furthermore, best practice recommends periodic evaluation of public health surveillance systems (PHSS). 7 Like other national public health agencies, 8 the French National Institute of Public Health (InVS) has implemented several prioritization exercises to guide its own surveillance strategy. [9] [10] [11] It has also implemented an external and formal evaluation process of its surveillance systems, based on a generic evaluation protocol drawn up in accordance with the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines, 12 and using a design developed by the European Center for Diseases Prevention and Control (protocol provided by Dr A. Ammon, personal communication). Four surveillance systems for infectious diseases were assessed between 2009 and 2013. 13 Given the current economic context, this assessment process was less than comprehensive as it did not consider the increasingly important question of the costs and the benefits of surveillance systems. The CDC guidelines 12 indicate that costs should not be estimated alone but be judged relative to benefits or at least relative to the effects of the surveillance system on prevention, care, research or decision-making. The guidelines state also that 'a more realistic approach would be to judge costs on the objectives and usefulness of the system'. However, the CDC guidelines do not clearly define methods to do so. A WHO report issued in 2005 underlined that the evaluation of the costs and the benefits of national surveillance and response systems was an area of great importance. In the report, the authors indicated that little related work has been carried out to that point and highlighted a number of methodological difficulties in evaluating benefits of a surveillance and response system such as implementing the appropriate study design, defining the scope of the surveillance or assigning a monetary value to health outcomes averted. 14 To assess the current development of economic evaluations in the field of public health surveillance, we performed a systematic review of the literature. In this review, we also assessed the methods used in the selected studies to evaluate the benefits of public health surveillance.",

            "text": "The C/E ratio was estimated at $23/per case averted and at $98/meningitis-related death averted Both C/E ratios were cost-saving Target populations varied among the studies from a whole country or a federal state 22,25 to a single county or city. 17, 18 Two studies were performed on theoretical exposed populations from 100 to 100 000 persons exposures. 23, 24 Time period was mentioned for four studies and costs were adjusted to the study period in all four. [22] [23] [24] [25] Three of the studies were based on retrospective events lasting from 22 weeks to 3 years. [17] [18] [19] The two remaining studies were based on one year surveillance periods. 20, 21 With respect to the four cost-effectiveness studies, two costeffectiveness and the one cost-utility analysis, compared two surveillance strategies (active case finding versus passive surveillance or surveillance and response versus no surveillance). 23-25 A Markov model was used for two of these studies. 23, 24 An experimental design was set up for the third one where the authors used the surveillance data from the previous 7 years' data for 5 years after the implementation of the surveillance and response program in order to assess the net costs for each health outcome prevented. 25 Health outcomes were expressed in number of cases or death prevented for two studies and in number of Qalys saved for one. These three studies have estimated an incremental cost-effectiveness (or cost-utility) ratio for the more efficient strategy. The fourth cost-effectiveness study focused on HIV surveillance. The authors of that study were not able to estimate the number of cases prevented by the HIV surveillance activities alone (which constituted only a part of the entire HIV prevention program). To overcome this methodological issue, the authors defined a level of cost-effectiveness based on a median value of ratios of 116 cost-effectiveness published studies. Based on this ratio, they estimated the number of HIV infections the entire HIV prevention program would need to prevent in order for it to be considered cost-effective. 21 With respect to the five cost-benefit studies, two were based on a comparison of two surveillance systems (active versus passive and electronic reporting versus manual reporting). Benefits were estimated as the costs saved for the cases prevented for one study and by the time gained in employing electronically captured surveillance data for the other. 18,20 A third study described the surveillance and response activities implemented to control an outbreak of salmonella. Benefits were estimated by the costs avoided of resulting potential cases and associated deaths if the outbreak had not been controlled by surveillance and response. 19 In the fourth study, the authors estimated the threshold number of cases of Escherichia Coli O157:H7 (EC O157:H7) that the system would need to prevent in order for this system to be considered cost-beneficial. 22 The fifth and final study modeled, over a 3-year period, the number of deaths prevented among persons aged 65 years and over during the days when a heat wave surveillance system had issued a warning. 17 The type of costs included was heterogeneous between the nine studies and depended on the scope of surveillance and response activities considered and the perspective used. The perspective used for the cost analysis was mentioned in five of them. 19, 21, 22, 23, 25 The four remaining in which the perspective was not stated, have used a government-funded public health perspective as they included only the costs linked to the surveillance system and response. 17, 18, 20, 24 Accordingly, some authors included only the direct costs for operating the surveillance system (capital costs, salaries or training costs, recurrent costs) 20,21 while others also included indirect costs linked to treatment and care or those linked to biological testing. 18, 22, 24, 25 Some authors also included indirect costs related to loss of productivity or pain and suffering as they use a societal perspective. 19, 23 In one of the five cost-benefit studies 22 and in three of the four cost-effectiveness studies, 21,23,25 a discount rate was applied. Among the five modelling studies, four have performed sensitivity analyses. [22] [23] [24] [25] Among the five cost-benefit studies, four concluded that a positive benefit existed for active surveillance versus passive or versus no surveillance in term of money or time spent. [17] [18] [19] [20] In the remaining study, the authors considered that the surveillance system was costbeneficial if five infections were averted per year. This estimate is much lower to than the 90 cases of EC O157 reported to the surveillance system the year of the study. 22 Among the four cost-effectiveness and cost-utility studies, two have considered that the implemented surveillance was cost-saving. 23, 25 The third one found different cost-effectiveness ratios under different scenarios of anthrax exposure (probability and number of persons exposed). In one over the four scenarios, the surveillance and emergency response was cost-effective. 24 For the fourth study focusing on HIV surveillance, the entire HIV prevention program was estimated to be cost-effective if at least 333 new cases of infections were averted each year which represents 13% of the new diagnosis reported the year of the study. 21 ",

This highlights the practical obstacles to making standardized costs estimations of PHSS. The above mentioned WHO report 14 suggests including both the costs of surveillance and response as the ultimate purpose of surveillance information is to inform public health decision-making and to guide response and control activities. A conceptual framework of public health surveillance and action comprising six surveillance core activities such as detection, confirmation or analyses and two public health actions (acute and planned responses) and four support activities such as communication and training has recently been developed. 33 This framework aims at assessing the performances of PHSS and could also be useful for conducting standardized cost analysis for PHSS.",

Nevertheless, this approach cannot be applied when the primary objective of the surveillance activities is not linked to immediate response as illustrated in the study of HIV cost-effectiveness. Although information coming from surveillance is crucial to guide prevention activities and to allocate funds, in that study the authors underlined their difficulties in quantifying the surveillance-specific benefits of the surveillance from all the benefits provided by the a wide range of prevention activities implemented in the specific public health HIV program. 21 With respect to the CDC guidelines mentioned above for evaluating PHSS, 12 costs and benefits of a surveillance system should be estimated in the light of many other criteria including the objectives and the utility as well as several technical performance attributes. The methods used in the selected studies did not take into account all these parameters and could therefore have led to an underestimation or an overestimation of the benefits of the surveillance if, for example, the objectives were not been reached or if some technical attributes such as timeliness did not meet the quality standards. Finally, assuming that benefits can be defined solely in term of the costs of the health outcomes prevented may constitute a limited approach as cost-benefit analysis of PHSS includes also an option value and the need to take into account positive nonmonetary effects like the perception of health security where the general public is aware of the fact that health threats are regularly monitored and are controlled in a timely and efficiently manner irrespective of the number of cases avoided. There are also economic benefits in preventing diseases or large outbreaks in that people to continue to work and to be productive.",

In the light of the limitations of commonly used approaches, other methods of economic approaches may be useful. Among these, conjoint analysis (CA) could overcome to some extent the limitations and methodological issues discussed above. The theory behind this approach is that any product or good or service can be described by a set of characteristics and that the extent to which an individual places value on a product is determined by the level of these characteristics. 34 CA asks individuals to state a preference by presenting competing scenarios with both desirable and undesirable characteristics of a product or a service. CA has been applied to health care and public health interventions such as HIV vaccine and cancer control strategies. 35, 36 More recently, CA was performed to prioritize zoonotic diseases of public health concern. 37 CA has been also used to derive utility weight for QALY or to estimate willingness to pay for CB analysis. 38 To our knowledge, the method has not been used for a PHSS and may be worth exploring. Indeed, this type of economic evaluation could help policy makers and health professionals elicit preferences and help estimate their willingness to pay for a surveillance system according to different system characteristics and performance. This technique may also be useful for estimating the non-use value of a surveillance program. 39 This information could be useful to public health agencies and could help them to prioritize surveillance in a context of limited resources.",

Consequently, many articles were related to medical interventions rather than to public health surveillance and the selected studies accounted for a very small percentage of the identified articles.",

However, the fact that this review is extensive and that the majority of the selected studies (8/9) were identified in both databases proves that few economic evaluations of a PHSS have been performed to date and that the risk of having missed an article is most probably very low.",

Third, this article did not aim to critically review the quality of the selected studies. Certain methodological issues are pointed out in this article to underline how difficult it is sometimes to perform a full economic analysis in the field of public health surveillance. Finally, our primary objective was to look at the methods used in the economic evaluation of a PHSS. We did not focus on the results of these economic analyses despite the fact that in most of these studies, the authors considered the surveillance system in question either cost-effective or cost-beneficial.",

The most frequent approach employed to assess these benefits is to value the health outcomes prevented by the surveillance and response activities or to estimate the costs per number of health outcomes avoided by comparing two surveillance strategies. By using these approaches, other dimensions are overlooked. As an alternative, using other economic methods such as conjoint analysis could show promise for future development.",

This systematic review has retrieved only nine full economic evaluations regarding public health surveillance. In costbenefits analyses, benefits are estimated mainly by the costs of the health outcomes prevented. In cost-effectiveness analyses, different surveillance strategies are compared and benefits are estimated by the number of the health outcomes prevented by one strategy compared with another one. These approaches cannot take into account other positive non-monetary effects of public health surveillance. In the context of budgetary constraints, looking at efficiency of public health surveillance becomes increasingly necessary. There is a need in developing more research and studies in this field.",
