Despite rigorous global containment and quarantine efforts, the incidence of the virus continues to rise rapidly. Reports on management and practice preparation in different settings are therefore critical to prepare the community for the outbreak. In Singapore, since the first locally confirmed case of COVID-19 on 23 rd of January, there have been a total of 5050 locally confirmed cases, 11 deaths and 708 recovered patients (data obtained 17 th April 2020) ( Table 1) . 1 Individuals infected with COVID-19 typically present with fever, dry cough, and dyspnoea. 2 The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is highly contagious, transmitted between people through close contact, droplets and fomite. 3, 4 Although there is insufficient evidence to suggest that COVID-19 is transmitted via airborne particles, infection appears possible through aerosol-generating procedures such as bronchoscopy or open suctioning of the airway. 5, 6 In Singapore, there are a total of ten public and eight private hospitals serving a population of 5.7 million. The hospital discussed in this paper is an acute tertiary referral medical centre and the largest hospital in Singapore. It has 1785 beds and staff strength of 10,000. The hospital caters to approximately 1 million patients a year. It is also a major teaching and training institution for doctors, nurses and allied health professionals. The radiology department performs approximately 500,000 imaging exams a year. The general radiography section of the hospital has approximately 100 practising radiographers and is divided into three sections, namely: the Outpatient Imaging Centre (OIC), Inpatient Imaging Centre (IIC) and Emergency Imaging Centre (EIC). From 23 rd January to 17 th of April 2020, the hospital has received a total of 319 confirmed COVID-19 cases, and 141 patients are currently admitted. Our institution has received up to 30 cases in a single day. At the time of writing, the department has performed approximately over 6500 screening cases for COVID-19. Approximately 7% of Singapore's confirmed COVID-19 cases were admitted to our hospital 1",

We have developed a coordinated system to manage confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patients which we have found to be crucial to protect patients and staff while ensuring that the daily operations within the department can be adequately maintained.

The emergency and inpatient locations are considered high-risk working areas where COVID-19 patients are more likely to aggregate, whereas outpatient areas are deemed lower risk. We therefore divided our manpower teams along these lines; staff are prohibited from moving between segregated teams or from high-risk areas to low-risk areas, and vice versa. Teams are not allowed to meet or swap shifts with one another. In this manner, our teams are physically isolated from one another and allow continuity of services in the event of nosocomial spread of infection.",

This differs from the routine eight hour shifts prior to our COVID-19 manpower re-organization. The staffing needs for eight radiographers was decided based on the average workload of 10 cases per hour in the respective clinical areas. Each team consists of a team leader, a mobile radiography team of two radiographers for COVID-19 cases and five radiographers to cover the routine workload.

All five staff were eventually ruled out for COVID-19. Our system of reallocating radiographers from our outpatient reserve team has allowed us to sufficiently staff higher risk areas.

We therefore acquired four more mobile units to cover COVID-19 screening areas. To mitigate the shortage of equipment, we engaged existing vendors for loan of additional mobile radiography units. We created four additional mobile radiography teams designated for COVID-19 screening within the hospital. Apart from providing mobile imaging for COVID-19 patients, the current numbers of mobile radiography units also continue to cater to the routine non-COVID-19 radiography caseloads as well to ensure smooth provision of clinical services ( Table  3 ). In addition, we deployed all DR mobile units for COVID-19 purposes and kept the remaining computed radiography mobile units as reserves. The classic radiographic appearance of COVID-19 shows ground glass opacities, typically at the periphery of the lower lobes. [13] [14] [15] [16] As these radiographic findings may be subtle, it is crucial for chest radiographs to be imaged with the highest possible image quality. By using mobile DR units, there are fewer errors due to inadequate exposures as the DR detector has a higher dynamic range, and the image could be reprocessed if there was slight under or overexposure errors. Utilizing DR is also quicker and allows staff exposure to potential the COVID-19 pathogen kept to a minimum. All our DR mobile units are equipped with wireless capabilities to facilitate quick image upload for early reporting and access by radiologists and clinicians.",

The operation involves the hospital's infectious disease department, the police force, volunteers and other government agencies. On a larger context, contact tracing is done by phone call interviews to trace previous contacts and locations, reviewing CCTV footage and tracking mobile phone GPS. Contact tracing for hospital staff is done differently from the national protocol. Our infectious disease department will inform radiology regarding any patient of unknown COVID-19 status that eventually tested positive for COVID-19. The admin team in charge will then perform activity mapping of the patient through reviewing the audit trail records from the Radiology Informatics Systems. Staff with known COVID-19 exposure will then be interviewed via phone regarding the details of the PPE worn during the case and details of other staff members he/she had close contact with within a certain time period. Peripheral staff at risk for COVID-19 infection will also be contacted by the Infectious Disease department to monitor their body temperature twice daily and to seek urgent medical intervention if relevant symptoms develop. Depending on the risk level, some staff are required to quarantine for14 days at home.",

Clear and open communication channels from a central command task force allow unfiltered instructions and words of encouragement to be directly disseminated to staff. During the last three months, we have treated approximately150 COVID-19 patients, and we have zero incidences of healthcare worker infections (as of 27 th April 2020). Feedback from radiographers indicates the newly implemented 12 hour shift pattern is sustainable and maintains a constant work-rest cycle. We believe our experience may lend support to the radiology community currently facing the pandemic and serve as a blueprint for future infectious disease outbreak contingency plans. 11 Perform a total cleaning of the mobile unit with antimicrobial wipes.",
