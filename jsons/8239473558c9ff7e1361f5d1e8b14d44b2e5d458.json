For the sake of clarity, we limit our exposition of the scheme to the observables C s , the number of confirmed cases on day s. The other observables used analogously by the group are hospitalizations and deaths. Moreover, as our focus is on the days around March 17, when the lockdown started, and as close to two month have passed since then, we restrict our exposition to those days of infection where all infections can be assumed to be confirmed by the actual date of the monitoring. According to the parameters used by the group, 95% of the cases are confirmed within 20 days after infection. For their method of extending the reconstruction to later days we refer again to their article. Now, let X denote the incubation time of a randomly drawn case, i.e. the time between infection and symptom onset, and analogously Y the time between symptom onset and confirmation. The distributions of X and Y result from fitting to available data; see [1] and references therein. Then for every confirmed case a one samples independently a x a from the distribution of X and a y a from the distribution of Y .",

Assume that I 1 = 128 and R s = 2 for s \u2264 6 and R s = 0.8 for s \u2265 7, and that infectiousness is limited to the day after infection, i.e. w 1 = 1. This yields the 'true' infection numbers and reproductive numbers which are illustrated by the read curves in Fig.2 . For the reconstructed data we take X and Y both to be gaussian with mean 5 and standard deviation 1. Thus, the \"noise\" is also gaussian with mean 0 and standard deviation 2. With this \"noise\", the scheme results in the average in the corresponding blue curves. Of course, the blue curve R is prone to lead to wrong decisions: If a lockdown caused the sharp decline in R from day 6 to day 7, then the blue curve may suggest that its impact was much less important and that most of the reduction was achieved already before the lockdown. It might even lead to the conclusion that the lockdown was not needed at all and that softer measures in force already before day 6 have had a sufficient effect, where in reality they had no effect at all. This in turn could lead to the conclusion, that the pandemic can be kept under control by adhering to soft measures only.",

The analysis of thus smoothed number statistics yields stable results and is easier to handle than classical inference methods as applied in [5] . However, under certain circumstances like the current COVID-19 pandemic, the introduced noise effects dominate the information contained in the true data and lead to erroneous interpretations. The simpler approach adopted by the Robert Koch Institute performs better than the one by the group at ETH Basel. Moreover, we point out that adequate knowledge of the date of symptom onset is an advantage.",
