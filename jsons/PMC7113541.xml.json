            "text": "The following principles are used to create a standardized drug formulary at cabin hospitals: (1) oral dosage forms are preferred as patients being treated are of mild severity, and oral medications are more comfortable to administer while avoiding the risks of infections that parenteral injections may present, (2) a higher priority is given to medications recommended by the China National Health Commission guidelines, \u201cDiagnosis and Treatment Guidelines for the New Coronavirus Infected Pneumonia\u201d (the CNHC guidelines, currently in its seventh update) [2]. The CNHC guidelines recommend the use of antiviral drugs (\u03b1-interferon, lopinavir/ritonavir, ribavirin, chloroquine, umifenovir) and traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs) for the treatment of patients infected with COVID-19. When considering the number of drugs needed to be stocked, pharmacists should view each drug\u2019s treatment efficacy, safety, and route of administration. For example, \u03b1-interferon is administered through aerosol inhalation requiring an atomizing device, and there is a risk of virus transmission by inhalation. Ribavirin is administered intravenously, and both lopinavir/ritonavir and chloroquine have more safety concerns [2], and (3) the drug formulary should include medications for the relief and treatment of the coronavirus, as well as mitigating the symptoms of the disease such as antipyretic analgesics, antibiotics, hepatoprotective drugs, medicines for the regulation of intestinal microorganisms, digestive medications, respiratory medications, and psycho-neurological medications. Medications for patients with chronic diseases such as hypertension, heart disease, and asthma should be stocked to continue their treatment while in isolation, as well as resuscitation and emergency drugs. In general, the drug formulary contains approximately 100 medications for stocking (Table 1).",

For example, at the two hospitals the author (LM) worked, there were only three pharmacists providing care for almost 1000 patients. To meet the demand for pharmacy services, pharmacists must adjust workflow to optimize operational efficiency. The following is a discussion of the measures that may be considered: (1) preparing and maintaining drug par levels for each hospital ward. Ensure drugs are replenished daily based on consumption and the demand of the ward, this will effectively reduce the frequency of pharmacy dispensing and avoid unnecessary repeated labor, and (2) change the mode of drug delivery to prevent infection and further control the spread of the disease. Personnel should not be allowed to enter and leave the ward (polluted area) at will, and this may result in the inability of drugs being delivered to the ward on time. To this end, pharmacists provide drugs to the outside of the buffer zone, and coordinate hospital and ward staff to transfer medications inside wards.",

            "text": "At cabin hospitals, most patients have mild or suppressed symptoms following admission. Clinical symptoms patients mostly present with are fever, dry cough, and fatigue. Some patients also show nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat, myalgia, and diarrhea. Except for a small percentage of patients requiring no treatment, most patients received antivirals and drugs for symptomatic relief. Pharmacists typically provide the following pharmaceutical care: (1) educating patients on medications taken at the hospital and upon discharge (focusing on drug administration and precautions), (2) providing necessary drug information to physicians especially concerning drugs that general practitioners are not familiar with a focus on off-label drug use, and interactions between TCMs and western medicines, and (3) performing medication reconciliation to ensure the safe transition of care. Although cabin hospitals treat patients with mild cases, some patients may also have chronic diseases such as cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases and diabetes. Patients\u2019 chronic medications may have to be adjusted as the cabin hospital drug formulary is relatively limited. Pharmacists must also focus on particular patient populations such as the pregnant and elderly when care demand for pharmacists is high. In addition to routine pharmaceutical care, pharmacists should assist physicians in monitoring patients\u2019 mental health wellbeing as there is also a severe shortage of front-line physicians. Patients may develop anxiety and sleep disturbances during the hospital stay as being in isolation takes a toll on their mental health. These problems patients are faced with may also be a concern of being infected with the coronavirus or due to the side effects of medications.",

            "text": "Because of the infection control restrictions of pharmacists entering hospital wards and inadequate numbers of pharmacists working at each cabin hospital, pharmacists can deliver pharmaceutical care via multi-media educational materials and remote video/phone conversations to hospitalized patients. The pharmaceutical care activities mentioned above, can be provided to patients and physicians by pharmacists, regardless of their work locations, with the help of multi-media technology. Educational materials are created, targeting patients\u2019 medication needs at admission, during hospitalization, and upon discharge. The Union Hospital affiliated to Tongji Medical College of Huazhong University of Science and Technology launched the \u201cOnline Pharmaceutical Monitoring\u201d service [3], and the Beijing Pharmacist Association launched the \u201cYunwen Medicine\u201d service [4]. The \u201cYunwen Medicine\u201d platform brings together a team of outstanding pharmacists in Beijing, China. Drug information questions from patients or pharmacists at cabin hospitals are uploaded to the cloud platform and are answered promptly. These two remote access platforms allow pharmacists to communicate with physicians and patients on a one-to-one basis to effectively and efficiently identify and resolve drug-related problems.",
