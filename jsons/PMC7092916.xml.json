Written informed consent had been obtained from all subjects and detailed characteristics of the subjects had been described beforehand [6]. In short, the study population comprised 44 SARS patients in Vietnam, 103 staff members of the same hospital as control subjects, who had come into contact with SARS patients but had not developed SARS, and 50 individuals reflecting the general Vietnamese population, having had no contact history with SARS patients. Out of 44 SARS patients, 22 required oxygen therapy because of hypoxemia, with the other 22 cases, not being hypoxemic, not receiving any such oxygen therapy. There was a significant correlation between the degree of lung involvement in chest radiographs and the requirement of supplementary oxygen. Because of this finding, the progression of SARS in the lung could be reasonably determined from the status of supplementary oxygen ascertained in our previous study [6]. Peripheral blood samples were obtained in all subjects and the genomic DNAs were subsequently extracted [6]. Anti-SARS-CoV antibodies in the blood samples were tested by SARS ELISA (Genelabs Diagnostics, Singapore).",

As a result, the A/G SNP (rs#2660) in exon 8 of OAS-1 gene associated with outcome of HCV infection in the previous report by Knapp et al. [22] should have been located in exon 6, which falls on the 3\u2032-untranslated region of long transcript E18 (NM_016816). To detect the SNP, genomic DNA was amplified by AmpliTaq Gold DNA polymerase (Applied Biosystems) with primers 25AS-e6F (5\u2032-GAG GAC TGG ACC TGC ACC ATC CTC-3\u2032) and 25AS-e6R (5\u2032-AGA AAG TCA AGG CTG GAA TTT CAT-3\u2032), and the PCR products of 309 bp were digested with MboII (New England Biolabs) at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h. The 309 bp product was not cut in the presence of G-allele, but was cut into fragments in the presence of A-allele. Subsequently, the fragment was separated into 188 and 121 bp units on 2% agarose gels with ethidium bromide.",

In the presence of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), OAS-1 catalyzes the 2\u2032,5\u2032-oligomers of adenosine in order to permit the binding and activation of a latent ribonuclease, RNase L, which cleaves cellular and viral RNAs [11], [25]. OAS-1 gene has two major transcripts that are generated by alternative splicing at the last two exons [23]. E16 (NM_002534) is a short transcript with 5 exons and is translated to p40 isoform. E18 (NM_016816) is a long transcript with 6 exons and is translated to p46 isoform. Another transcript 9-2 is generated using a different splice acceptor site that comes from E18 at exon 6 and is translated to 9-2 protein [26]. The 9-2 protein has a unique property due to the Bcl-2 homology domain 3 present in its unique carboxyl-terminal region. This is also distinctive in causing cellular apoptosis by binding to the anti-apoptotic proteins of the Bcl-2 family [26]. Therefore, OAS-1 has dual functions representing the synthesis of 2\u2032,5\u2032-oligomers of adenosine and the promotion of cellular apoptosis.",

            "text": "Knapp et al. [22] described how the GG genotype in exon 6 of OAS-1 gene was more frequent in persistent HCV infection than in self-limiting infection. In our study, the G-allele was more frequently observed in SARS-CoV infected individuals than in the uninfected group. In both these studies, the G-allele was susceptible to virus infection. The A/G polymorphism in exon 6 is located downstream of the stop codon for E18 transcript meaning therefore that it is included in the 3\u2032-untranslated region. However, it is located upstream of the stop codon for 9-2, and the A/G SNP results in amino acid substitution Arg397Gly of 9-2 protein, which is located near the Bcl-2 homology domain (amino acid positions 372\u2013393). It will be an interesting aspect if this phenomenon occurs with any functional importance. We also analyzed the A/G polymorphism in exon 3 of OAS-1 gene and found that there was strong linkage disequilibrium between the two SNPs. The A/G polymorphism in exon 3 causes amino acid substitution Ser162Gly in three isoforms, which is located near the dsRNA binding domain (amino acid positions 104\u2013158) of OAS-1 [27]. We are unable at this point to determine which SNP is directly related to susceptibility to SARS or SARS-CoV infection. One can also consider that the other unidentified polymorphism of strong linkage disequilibrium with these SNPs may serve as the basis for any functional difference. Judging from the results obtained in this study, polymorphisms in OAS-1 gene are likely to be involved in SARS-CoV infection or the development of SARS, at least in part, bearing in mind the fact that OAS-1 might have antiviral potential against SARS-CoV.",
