However one recent study did show that inhaled salbutamol up to 1600 \u03bcg did not improve lung exercise performance [7] . The Medical Commission of the International Olympic Committee imposed its ban on inhaled beta-agonists in 1993 due to the growing concern of increased use among elite athletes in order to help improve oxygen uptake and thus lead to an unfair advantage in endurance, speed, and strength. Other organizations have imposed their bans as well, and it is important to be aware of sport governing bodies when it comes to treating asthma and bronchospasm. Along with the pharmacological treatment of asthma, education and prevention of symptoms is also a key component to maintaining adequate control of the athlete's symptoms. The athlete should attempt to identify triggers for their symptoms, which may vary from seasonal allergies, like pollen to dust mites or even weather changes. For example, cold weather changes can be correlated to the development of asthma symptoms. An individual must demonstrate vigilance to keep their symptoms under control by altering environmental exposures and utilizing controller medication. These environmental changes may include changing practice locations based on the weather, using a humidifier or anti-allergen air filters at home, or even avoiding the use of NSAIDs, as they may predispose athletes to asthma flares [8] .

Other modifying factors include increasing endurance training as studies have shown that endurance athletes tend to have higher lung volumes by way of strengthening respiratory muscles, reducing resistance through bronchial canals, and increasing lung elasticity and alveolar expansion in order to adapt to the demands brought forth by endurance training [9] .

However, when athletes exert themselves and the respiratory rate increases, this allows for the cool environmental air to reach the lower airways, thus giving the distal bronchial tree the task of warming and conditioning the air.

The thermal expenditure theory states that the airway cooling from the increased respiratory rate will cause vasoconstriction surrounding the lower airway bronchial tree and that upon the rewarming of the airway, the surrounding vasculature will dilate to engorge and rewarm the bronchial epithelium and leads to vascular leakage and airway edema [10] . The osmotic theory focuses on the water loss mechanisms that the bronchial epithelium and submucosa utilize in an attempt to warm the cool air that reaches the lower airways, which then causes changes in the epithelial pH and creates a hyperosmolar state that then leads to a cascade of molecular changes that release immune-modulators and mediators instigating bronchial constriction [10] .

The refractory period is the time following spontaneous resolution of EIB symptoms where athletes will not experience any further symptoms for the next 1-2 hours, however, may have return of symptoms following this grace period [6] . This period may mask the diagnosis as athletes may not report the issue to their medical staff but then have recurrence of symptoms afterward. To properly diagnose the condition, pulmonary function tests (PFTs) should be conducted while at rest to rule in or out any underlying chronic asthma. Following this, other pathologies should be ruled out including vocal cord dysfunction, gastroesophageal reflux, and cardiac abnormalities. The diagnosis of EIB can be made with the use of an exercise challenge test, eucapnic voluntary hyperventilation test (EVH), hyperosmolar saline challenge test, mannitol challenge test, or a direct challenge test with the use of methacholine to induce bronchoconstriction. The most commonly used tests are the exercise challenge test and the EVH, which focus on the FEV1 and its decline from baseline following provocation with either exercise or voluntary hyperventilation measured at various time limits following introduction of the stimulus. A decline in FEV1 of >10% in EVH or peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) of 15% or greater indicates positive results with these tests [8, 11] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 530, "end": 533, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1647, "end": 1650, "text": "[8,", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1651, "end": 1654, "text": "11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Exercise-Induced Bronchoconstriction: Diagnosis"}, {"text": "When it comes to the treatment of EIB, it is important to look at all modifiable factors as well as pharmacologic options to maximize a football player's pulmonary capabilities. The use of gaiters, scarves, or masks can theoretically limit the amount of cool air that reaches the lower respiratory tree, thus limiting the effects of bronchoconstriction. Short warm-ups 15-20 min prior to activity at 80-90% of maximum exertion, calisthenics, and proper cooldown post-workouts have also been shown to limit the EIB response with athletes [4] . Many of the same medications that treat asthma can be utilized. Two to four puffs of a short-acting beta-agonist (SABA) inhaler ( Fig. 57.2) , 20 min prior to exercise or a match, can help control the onset of symptoms, if exercise is expected to last no more than 6 h. If there is a tournament or the player is expected to exert themselves for a longer period of time, then a long-acting beta-agonist (LABA) can be considered as their effects can last up to 12 h after administration. Leukotriene antagonists and cromolyn can also be utilized for those that cannot tolerate the beta-agonist inhalers; however, these may not be as effective.

Only 2% of all adult pneumothoraces are associated with sports and can be spontaneous or tension-related [12] . Spontaneous PTX is found more often in tall, thin, and young individuals. It will occur, as its name suggests, spontaneously from primary or secondary etiology, secondary being in the setting of underlying pulmonary disease including pneumonia, asthma, cystic fibrosis, or interstitial lung disease. Tension PTX is much less common and typically occurs due to blunt or penetrating trauma from a fracture rib that disrupts the pleura.

The needle is inserted into the second intercostal space in the midclavicular line to relieve the pressure, which may be followed by a rush of air [4, 13] . Following this procedure, the placement of a chest tube to allow for lung re-expansion is needed. Repeat CXR to visualize re-expansion of the lung and ensure proper chest tube placement is recommended (Fig. 57.4 ).
