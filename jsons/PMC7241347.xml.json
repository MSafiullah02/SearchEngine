Over boundaries diffusion of SARS-CoV-2 resulted in the pandemic declaration by WHO and the consequent adoption of a series of containment measures to promptly control the virus spread and COVID-19 diffusion [1,2]. To date, COVID-19 diffusion seems to be approaching to an end in the outbreak epicentre and the early affected countries (e.g. Italy), whereas lately affected countries are likely to diminish the COVID-19 incidence in the very near future [3,4]. Nevertheless, prospective studies are predicting the cyclic recurrence of epidemic waves of SARS-CoV-2 over a very short period of time [3], raising the need for the timely development of effective diagnostic tools and prophylactic strategies, other than the design of adequate guidelines for patients\u2019 treatments in the diverse stages of the infection.",

Coronaviruses are spherical viruses of large dimension with a positive-sense unsegmented RNA genome of approximately 30 kilobases. Coronavirus specimens are already known in veterinary medicine since capable of infecting an extended spectrum of both wild (e.g. bat, palm civet) and domestic animals (e.g. bovine) including the companion ones (e.g. dogs). The infection is commonly manifested as respiratory illness along with other mild signs such as enteritis [5,6]. Acknowledged their zoonotic potential, coronaviruses have also represented a public health issue with mild manifestation commonly referable to flu-like symptoms. Exceptions are represented by the SARS-CoV epidemic in China in 2002 [7] and the Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) registered in Saudi Arabia in 2012 [8] when the more severe manifestation of the infection occurred as a consequence of increased pathogenicity of the circulating viral specimens. Unfortunately, no vaccines or therapy were made available from the previous outbreaks and the recent warningly predictions justify the overwhelming effort being performed worldwide under diverse perspectives.",

This is of pivotal importance for the adequate design of effective diagnostic tools and control measures. Elucidating immunological properties of the circulating SARS-CoV-2 along with the tracking of the epitopes distribution among coronaviruses with tropism for the most common synanthropic animals might provide a clear depiction of the co-shared epitopes. Such approach might, from one side, suggest the occurrence of partial protection arising from the human-animal interrelation while, on the other hand, it might provide a valuable list of epitope candidates to be used for the differential diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Investigation of the major viral structural proteins (i.e. Spike, Membrane, Nucleocapsid and Envelope) provides unevaluable knowledge for a comprehensive depiction of the antigenic determinants of the circulating virus [[9], [10], [11]]. Our previous studies investigated epitope diffusion of the Spike and Nucleocapsid SARS-CoV-2 proteins, highlighting some epitopes sequences as conserved among a restricted group of taxonomically-related specimens while other epitopes sequences were shared between coronavirus with tropism for the animal\u2019s human are continuously interacting with [9,10].",

            "text": "Along with Spike (S) and Nucleocapsid (NC) protein, Envelope (E) is a structural protein involved in diverse phases of the virus infection. E protein of SARS-CoV-2 is a 75 aminoacids long protein existing in both monomeric and homo-pentameric form. Approximately 20 copies of the protein have been found in the viral particle and previous mutagenesis-based studies demonstrated its pivotal role in the onset and development of the viral infection [12]. Specifically, E protein lacking virions are associated with incapability of infecting host cell or very low viral titers [13]. Other functions have been predicted for E protein within the infected cells. E protein localizes within the secretory pathways at the interspace between the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus. Here, the arrangement of the hydrophobic transmembrane domain into a homo-pentamer has been predicted to form an ion channel (i.e. virioporin) in several coronavirus strains. Whereas, PDZ binding domain (PBD) at the C-terminal of the aminoacid polymer is supposed to hinder the host cell functionality to favor viral replication and dissemination within the host body [12,14,15]. Besides its multifunctional properties, E protein is also highly immunogenic attracting the attention of diverse research groups that target this protein for the development of antigen-based studies including those aimed at developing immunodiagnostic tools and prophylactic oriented studies [11,16]. To date, immunoinformatic is among the most promising approaches to survey the antigenic determinants of novel and unknown molecules. It is based on the use of computational resources (e.g. software, algorithms and statistic models) to investigate protein sequences and predict the antigenicity of molecule portions (epitope prediction). It is based on different parameters such as the physicochemical properties of the aminoacids, their spatial localization, and the complementarity and affinity with models of the immune response effectors such as the B-cells and T-cells [[16], [17], [18]].",

It predicts the location of linear B-cell epitopes using a combination of a hidden Markov model and a propensity scale method [20]. Both default threshold settings (0.350) and a lower threshold value (0.250) were used. T-cell epitopes were predicted by using the artificial neural network (ANN) algorithm. The list of epitopes binding to MHC class I and class II molecules was obtained via MHC-I Binding and MHC-II Binding tools respectively. In line with a very recent study [16], epitopes sequences with a minimal length of 10 aminoacids were selected and immunogenic domains binding to MHC I and II molecules scoring respectively a median inhibitory concentration (IC50) equal or less than 100 and 1000, were employed for the sequence alignment against the E protein sequence of the taxonomically related coronaviruses with tropism for other synanthropic and/or domestic animals. The BLAST-based alignment was performed using BLOSUM62 algorithm to compare protein sequences and calculate the statistical significance of matches as means of e-values. Only the best hits were considered for each virus and hits with alignment length minor or equal to 4 aminoacids were manually removed.",

This aspect has also been taken into account while choosing the viral specimens to be included in this survey.

On the other hand, the \u201cshared\u201d immunostimulant domains can be used for the design of a more accurate and efficient immunodiagnostic tool, enabling a detailed tracking of the infected patients and the fair discrimination of the SARS-CoV-2 infected ones from the others that came in contact with the antigens carried by other coronaviruses.

Although all predicted sequence epitopes have been matched in the SARS-CoV E protein sequence, some of the epitopes capable of binding the class II MHC molecules scored a lower identity percentage when compared with bat and pangolin coronavirus, supporting our hypothesis that investigating synanthropic and/or domestic animals might be a promising strategy that provides interesting research suggestions.",
