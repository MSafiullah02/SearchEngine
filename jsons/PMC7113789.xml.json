SARS-CoV belongs to the genus Betacoronavirus of the family Coronaviridae (King et al., 2011). Coronaviruses are enveloped viruses with positive-sense, non-segmented, single-stranded RNA genomes, characterized by club-like projections on the virus particles (Masters, 2006). The first two thirds of the coronavirus genome encode the replicase genes, which are translated into two large polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab, that are processed into 15 or 16 non-structural proteins (nsp) via proteolytic cleavage (Thiel et al., 2003). The remaining one third of the genome contains ORFs for the structural proteins, namely the spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins.",

These proteins are specific for SARS-CoV and do not show significant homology to accessory proteins of other coronaviruses, with the exception of the SARS-like coronavirus SL-CoV-WIV1 that was recently discovered in bats (Ge et al., 2013) and has the same set of accessory proteins as SARS-CoV.

            "text": "Coronavirus accessory proteins have been generally considered to be dispensable for viral replication in vitro (de Haan et al., 2002, Haijema et al., 2004, Yount et al., 2005, Ontiveros et al., 2001, Shen et al., 2003, Hodgson et al., 2006, Casais et al., 2005). However, several accessory proteins have been shown to exhibit functions in virus-host interactions during coronavirus infection in vivo. For example, deletion of ORF2a (NS2), HE, ORF4, and ORF5a in the mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) led to a significant attenuation of the virus in its natural host (de Haan et al., 2002). On the other hand, continuous passage of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) in cell culture results in a mutation in the 3b gene coding for a C-terminally truncated 3b protein. Interestingly, compared with wild-type virus, the mutant virus has a growth advantage and increases virulence in the chicken embryo (Shen et al., 2003). Similarly, recent studies have suggested that SARS-CoV accessory proteins may confer biological advantages to the virus in the natural host, and contribute to the pathogenesis of SARS (Narayanan et al., 2008). Extensive functional studies in cell culture and animal models have shown that SARS-CoV accessory proteins are involved in a wide variety of cellular processes, such as cell proliferation, programmed cell death, activation of stress response pathways and cytokine production, to name just a few. Notably, some coronaviral accessory proteins have also been shown to modulate the interferon signaling, which is of paramount importance for host antiviral immunity (Frieman et al., 2007, Dedeurwaerder et al., 2014, Zhang et al., 2013, Cruz et al., 2013).",

However, for the formation of these VLPs, p3a of SARS-CoV is dispensible (Yount et al., 2005). Being efficiently expressed on the cell surface, the protein was easily detected in a majority of SARS patients due to the triggering of a humoral and cellular immune response in these patients (Lu et al., 2009). In light of immunity, p3a can cause the activation of NF-\u03baB and JNK leading to the upregulation of RANTES and IL-8 in A549 and HEK293T cells (Kanzawa et al., 2006). It has also been demonstrated to up-regulate fibrinogen mRNA and protein levels in A549 cells (Tan et al., 2005).",

The p3a is able to interact with the SARS-CoV S protein by formation of disulfide linkages through its cysteine-rich regions, mainly the CWLCWKC region (aa 127\u2013133) (Zeng et al., 2004). Another important feature is the oligomerization of p3a as it is able to form homodimers and homotetramers (Lu et al., 2006). Through inducing point mutations, Lu et al. showed that Cys133 is important for oligomerization of the protein and confirmed the formation of dimers and tetramers through FRET (Lu et al., 2006). Utilizing Xenopus oocytes, their results were suggestive of the tetramers being able to form a potassium-permeable ion channel and modulating release of SARS-CoV particles (Lu et al., 2006, Shi et al., 2006). Chan et al. further validated that blocking these ion channels suppressed SARS-CoV-mediated apoptosis (Chan et al., 2009).",

This domain can play a role in G1 cell-cycle arrest by depletion of cyclin D3 (Yuan et al., 2007). Interestingly, p3a seems to share a similar topology with the M protein (Marra et al., 2003). The Yxx\u03a6 motif plays a role in internalization of proteins into various intracellular components, including proteins from the plasma membrane into the endosomes (Bonifacino and Traub, 2003, Trowbridge et al., 1993). The diacidic motif is required for ER export (Nishimura and Balch, 1997). Tan et al. demonstrated that deletion of the C-terminal domain would prevent the protein from being expressed on the cell surface (Tan et al., 2004). Furthermore, they also hypothesized that the Yxx\u03a6 motif presented in p3a would allow the internalization of the S protein and prevent its presentation on the cell surface (Tan, 2005).

            "text": "p3a can be detected in the supernatant in two different forms from infected Vero E6 cells or Caco2 cells (Lu et al., 2006, Huang et al., 2006). Huang et al. demonstrated by sucrose-gradient centrifugation and densitometric scans the presence of a 37-kDa form (protein 3a-1) and a 31-kDa form (protein 3a-2). The 37-kDa form was detected in fractions with similar densities (1.18\u20131.20 g/ml) to the SARS-CoV particles, as opposed to fractions containing the 31-kDa form (1.13\u20131.15 g/ml) Tan et al., 2005, Yuan et al., 2007, suggesting that the 31-kDa form may be present as extracellular membrane structures while the 37-kDa form may be assembled into the mature virons. The presence of these two forms is due to the protein 3a being able to be modified post-translationally. This protein can be O-glycosylated as demonstrated by Oostra et al. through electrophoretic mobility-shift assays, transforming the unmodified 31-kDa form into a 33-kDa form (Oostra et al., 2006). p3a resembles the M protein of other coronaviruses, such as MHV, in terms of (1) the subcellular localization pattern of M protein (Tan et al., 2004, Klumperman et al., 1994, Yuan et al., 2005), (2) having an extracellular N-terminus and a C-terminal endodomain, (3) spanning the membrane three times (Rottier et al., 1984, Rottier et al., 1986, Braakman and Van Anken, 2000), and (4) being considered a structural protein (Ito et al., 2005, Shen et al., 2005). Despite both M and 3a proteins being glycosylated, p3a in Ost-7 cells is neuraminidase-sensitive but not O-glycosidase sensitive, in contrast to the M protein where it is sensitive to both (Oostra et al., 2006).",

Interestingly, Yount et al. demonstrated that deletion of ORF3 and ORF6 decreased the overall virus titres as compared to just deleting ORF 3a alone, suggesting that ORF3a is non-essential (Yount et al., 2005). In contrast, there is conflicting evidence that ORF3a may be essential, because of the reduction of viral titres in SARS-CoV-infected cells transfected with a siRNA targeting p3a (\u00c5kerstr\u00f6m et al., 2007). We propose that this may be due to the subsequent knockdown of p3b as well, resulting in the lower virus production.",

            "text": "Using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Freundt et al. observed in Vero cells that only in the presence of p3a, intracellular vesicles will be formed, as observed in the pathology in SARS patients (Freundt et al., 2010). The presence of Lamp-1 through immunofluorescence can also be detected in these vesicles (Freundt et al., 2010), indicating the formation of late endosomes. Expression of p3a is also required for the Golgi fragmentation for its acquisition of a viral envelope. Through yeast-2-hybrid and FRET assays, Padhan et al. have demonstrated caveolin-1 binding to p3a, which may play a role in virus uptake and release (Padhan et al., 2007).p3a has also been associated with ER stress through the activation of the PERK pathway but not the IRE-1 and ATF6 pathway (Minakshi et al., 2009). Minakshi et al. analyzed this by transfecting Huh7 cells with p3a and luciferase-tagged ER stress-related molecules, showing that it can enhance protein folding, but not activate Endoplasmic Reticulum Associated Degradation (ERAD) Minakshi et al., 2009. The long-term triggering of the PERK pathway can also induce virus-related apoptosis through the expression of its downstream mediators of ATF4 and CHOP, similar to IBV infection (Liao et al., 2013). Padhan et al. have shown that protein 3a can lead to increased activation of the p38 MAP kinase pathway and induce the mitochondria to leak cytochrome c to induce apoptosis (Padhan et al., 2008).",

            "text": "Protein 3b (p3b) is translated from ORF3 using an IRES (Rota et al., 2003), overlapping the SARS-CoV E gene as well as the ORF3a. Similarly to the SARS-CoV p3a, p3b does not share any homology with other known proteins (Marra et al., 2003). Moreover, p3b is not expressed in SARS-CoV isolates from bats due to the presence of a stop codon (Ren et al., 2006). Anti-p3b antibodies can also be detected in the sera of infected SARS patients (Guo et al., 2004). Yuan et al. have shown using immunofluorescence that the SARS-CoV p3b is localized in the nucleolus of infected Vero E6 cells (Yuan et al., 2005) as well as in the mitochondria (Yuan et al., 2006, Freundt et al., 2009). The shuttling behavior may be due to the presence of a nuclear export sequence and determined by a leptomycin B-sensitive mechanism. Furthermore, involvement of p3b has also been demonstrated in the induction of necrosis and apoptosis independent of its subcellular localization (Khan et al., 2006, Yuan et al., 2005). p3b is also able to inhibit the antiviral response by down-regulating type-I interferon (IFN-\u03b2) as well as the mitochondrial antiviral response (Freundt et al., 2009, Spiegel et al., 2005). Using flow cytometry, Yuan et al., showed that COS-7 cells transfected with p3b are arrested at the G0/G1 phase (Yuan et al., 2005). The protein may play a role in immunomodulation through binding to RUNX1b, as seen from yeast-two-hybrid and co-immunoprecipitation by Varshney et al. Varshney et al. (2012). Additionally, p3b can act as an interferon antagonist through inhibition of IRF3 (Kopecky-Bromberg et al., 2007) and activation of AP-1 through upregulating the expression levels of JNK and ERK (Varshney and Lal, 2011) (see Table 2\n).",

By sucrose gradient centrifugation and a virus-capture assay, Huang et al. have demonstrated that p6 is incorporated into mature virions (Huang et al., 2007). Moreover, when co-expressed with SARS-CoV S, M, and E proteins, p6 is incorporated into VLPs. However, p6 is not detected in the virions when expressed via a recombinant murine coronavirus (MHV) (Pewe et al., 2005). These results indicate that specific physical interactions between p6 and other SARS-CoV structural proteins may be required for recruiting p6 into the virus particles (see Table 3\n).",

However, a later study by Zhao et al. has demonstrated that, at a low MOI (0.01), rSARS-CoV-\u03946 replicates slower and to lower titres in cell cultures (Zhao et al., 2009). Compared with wild-type virus, lower viral titres as well as lower levels of viral RNA and protein were observed for rSARS-CoV-\u03946 at the early stage of infection, but the differences gradually diminished as the infection progressed. Importantly, when transgenic mice expressing the SARS-CoV receptor hACE2 were used, rSARS-CoV-\u03946-infected mice demonstrated a lower morbidity and mortality, with slightly lower virus titres in lung and brain tissue compared with wild-type virus (Zhao et al., 2009). Moreover, when ORF6 was introduced into an otherwise sub-lethal strain of MHV, the recombinant virus displayed enhanced growth in cell cultures and resulted in lethal encephalitis in infected mice (Pewe et al., 2005, Tangudu et al., 2007). Taken together, these results indicate that SARS-CoV p6 enhances viral replication in vitro and in vivo, and it may serve an important role in the pathogenesis during SARS-CoV infection.",

Using transmission electron microscopy, Zhou et al. showed that full-length p6 or the N-terminal domain modified the cellular membrane, producing perinuclear vesicles that resemble the double-membrane vesicles (DMVs) known to be associated with coronavirus replication (Zhou et al., 2010). The ability to modify intracellular membranes may also explain the observation that SARS-CoV p6 induces ER stress in transfected cells (Ye et al., 2008). The p6-induced perinuclear vesicles, similar to the virus-induced DMVs, may derive and reorganize the membrane from the ER, thus leading to perturbation of ER function and induction of ER stress (Ye et al., 2008, Knoops et al., 2008). Notably, p6 is found to partially co-localize with nonstructural protein 3 (nsp3), which contains the papain-like viral protease and is a marker of the replication complex, as well as nonstructural protein 8 (nsp8), the primer-independent, non-canonical RNA polymerase (Tangudu et al., 2007, Zhou et al., 2010, Kumar et al., 2007). Moreover, physical interaction between p6 and nsp8 in SARS-CoV-infected Vero E6 cells has been confirmed by Kumar et al. using yeast two-hybrid and co-immunoprecipitation (Kumar et al., 2007). These results indicate that the N-terminal domain of p6 may play a role in the formation of the replication complex in SARS-CoV-infected cells and serve auxiliary or modulatory functions during SARS-CoV genome replication.",

Further studies by the same group revealed that p6 can physically interact with karyopherin alpha 2 (KPNA2) and tether it to the rough ER (Frieman et al., 2007). The immobilized KPNA2 interacts with karyopherin beta 1 (KPNB1) and prevents it from forming a complex with STAT1 to facilitate nuclear import (Zhao et al., 2009). The KPNA2-interacting region in p6 is mapped to 10 aa in the C-terminal region (Frieman et al., 2007). Later, Hussain et al. confirmed that p6 but not its C-terminally truncated mutant (p6\u0394C) impeded the nuclear import of proteins harboring a classical nuclear localization signal (NLS) (Hussain et al., 2008). Further studies also demonstrated that the C-terminal tail is necessary but not sufficient to impede nuclear import, and a lipophilic N-terminus context is required (Hussain and Gallagher, 2010). Taken together, these results point to a role of the C-terminal domain of p6 in modulating host protein nuclear transport and type-I interferon signaling, which may be important for immune evasion during SARS-CoV infection.",

The protein is localized in the ER and ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) in SARS-CoV-infected cells and in transfected cells (Fielding et al., 2004, Nelson et al., 2005). Using sucrose gradient centrifugation and a virus capture assay, Huang et al. have shown that SARS-CoV p7a is a structural protein incorporated into mature virions (Huang et al., 2006). Although p7a physically interacts with the SARS-CoV S protein and accessory protein 3a, neither S nor p3a is required for recruiting p7a into the virus particle; since p7a-containing VLPs can be produced in cells expressing only SARS-CoV M, E, and 7a (Tan et al., 2004, Huang et al., 2006) (see Table 4\n).",

            "text": "SARS-CoV p7a is a type-I transmembrane protein with 122 amino-acid residues in length (Fig.3). The 15 N-terminal residues constitute a signal peptide, which is cleaved by signal peptidase in both SARS-CoV-infected cells and in transfected cells (Fielding et al., 2004, Nelson et al., 2005). The aa residues 16\u201396 comprise the luminal domain, which folds into a compact seven-stranded \u03b2 sandwich that resembles members of the Ig superfamily (Nelson et al., 2005). The sequence and structural homology between SARS-CoV p7a and ICAM-1 suggested that p7a may interact with the lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1 (LFA-1), which was later confirmed by direct in vitro binding experiments in Jurkat cells (H\u00e4nel et al., 2006, H\u00e4nel and Willbold, 2007). These data suggest LFA-1 to be an attachment factor or even receptor for SARS-CoV on human leukocytes, although a majority of p7a is found to remain intracellular in SARS-CoV-infected cells (Nelson et al., 2005, H\u00e4nel and Willbold, 2007). Residues 97\u2013117 of SARS-CoV p7a are highly hydrophobic and transverse the cellular membrane. The last 5 residues of the C-terminal tail (KRKTE) form a typical ER retention motif (KKXX or KXKXX, where X is any amino acid). When this motif is mutated from KRKTE to ERETE, p7a fails to be retro-transported to the ER and accumulates in the Golgi, where it undergoes rapid proteolytic processing (Fielding et al., 2004). Moreover, when the transmembrane domain and the short C-terminal tail of SARS-CoV p7a are fused with the cell-surface protein CD4, the chimera protein (CD4/orf7a-TM-tail) is found to be partially retained in the Golgi (Nelson et al., 2005). Fielding et al. have demonstrated physical interaction between SARS-CoV p7a and the host protein small glutamine-rich tetratricopeptide repeat-containing protein (SGT) (Fielding et al., 2006). Previous studies have shown that SGT interacts with the HIV-1 accessory protein vpu, which is essential in modulating viral particle release (Bour and Strebel, 2003). These results, together with the fact that SARS-CoV p7a is localized in the ER and ERGIC where coronaviruses generally assemble, and that p7a physically interacts with SARS-CoV M and E proteins, indicate that p7a may serve a function in the assembly stage during SARS-CoV replication (Fielding et al., 2006).",

This is consolidated by the finding that recombinant SARS-CoV with 7a and 7b deleted is not as efficient as wild-type virus in inducing DNA fragmentation, although the induction of early apoptotic markers such as annexin-V binding and caspase-3 activation are similar (Schaecher et al., 2007). These results indicate that SARS-CoV-induced apoptosis is only partially contributed by p7a, and other viral factors may be involved in the process. Later, Tan et al. demonstrated that the pro-apoptotic property of SARS-CoV p7a depends on its transmembrane domain, which is also required for its interaction with Bcl-XL, an anti-apoptotic protein belonging to the Bcl-2 family (Tan et al., 2007). Interestingly, SARS-CoV p7a interacts strongly with the pro-survival members of the Bcl-2 family (such as Bcl-XL, Bcl-w, Mcl-1, and A1), but not the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins (such as BAD, BID, BAX and BAK) (Tan et al., 2007). The selective interactions may hinder the pro-survival functions of these proteins and result in apoptosis induction in SARS-CoV-infected cells.",

A later study by Yuan et al. confirmed that overexpression of 7a led to cell cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phase, possibly by inhibiting the phosphorylation of retinoblastoma (Rb) protein (Yuan et al., 2006). Deletion-mutant experiments narrowed down the domain spanning aa 44\u201382 to be essential for cytoplasmic localization and cell-cycle arrest (Yuan et al., 2006). Overexpression of 7a has also been shown to activate nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), which in turn induce the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin 8 (IL-8) and RANTES (Kanzawa et al., 2006). Moreover, using EGFP fusion protein, Kopecky-Bromberg et al. showed that overexpression of 7a activates the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and inhibits cellular protein synthesis at the translation level (Kopecky-Bromberg et al., 2006). However, p7a-induced apoptosis is not inhibited in the presence of a p38 inhibitor, indicating that p7a induces apoptosis via mechanisms independent of the MAPK pathways (Kopecky-Bromberg et al., 2006).",

Protein 7b is a 44-aa, highly hydrophobic polypeptide (Schaecher et al., 2007). It is an integral transmembrane protein with a luminal N-terminus and a cytoplasmic C-terminus (Fig. 3). Similar to p7a, the 7b protein is localized throughout the Golgi compartment in both SARS-CoV-infected cells and in cells transfected with 7b cDNA (Schaecher et al., 2007). The Golgi-restricted localization of p7b was attributed to the transmembrane domain, specifically aa 21\u201323 and 27\u201330 of p7b (Schaecher et al., 2008). Notably, when the Golgi-targeting sequence of SARS-CoV p7b is used to replace the transmembrane domain of the cell-surface protein CD4, the chimeric protein is retained in the Golgi complex (Schaecher et al., 2008). Thus, the transmembrane domain of p7b is both necessary and sufficient for its Golgi localization.",

Interestingly, a prototype virus (strain Frankfurt-I) isolated during the 2003 SARS outbreak has a 45-nt deletion in the transmembrane domain of ORF7b upon propagation in cell culture for 3 passages (Thiel et al., 2003). Pfefferle et al. have performed extensive investigations on the consequence of this deletion using reverse genetics (Pfefferle et al., 2009). It was found that compared with the parental virus, the recombinant SARS-CoV with ORF7b deleted had a replicative advantage in Caco-2 and Huh7 cells, but not in Vero cells (Pfefferle et al., 2009). Moreover, the virus titre and viral RNA levels were significantly higher in Syrian Golden Hamsters infected with the 7b-deleted virus, indicating that SARS-CoV p7b may be an attenuating factor in vivo (Pfefferle et al., 2009). In a different approach, \u00c5kerstr\u00f6m et al. showed that siRNA specific for SARS-CoV sgRNA7 can inhibit sgRNA7 and sgRNA8 (thus silencing the expression of 7a, 7b, 8a, 8b) without affecting the full-length genomic mRNA and other sgRNAs (\u00c5kerstr\u00f6m et al., 2007). In Vero E6 cells expressing this siRNA, the production of progeny viruses was significantly reduced, indicating that p7a/p7b (and p8a/p8b) may play certain roles during the replication cycle of SARS-CoV. The discrepancies regarding the functions of p7b during SARS-CoV replication may be due to the different systems and animal models used. Further studies are required to validate these results and characterize the detailed mechanisms.",

Interestingly, in SARS-CoV isolated from humans during the peak of the epidemic, there is a 29-nt deletion in the middle of ORF8, resulting in the splitting of ORF8 into two smaller ORFs, namely ORF8a and ORF8b (He et al., 2004, Guan et al., 2003). During the late stage of the SARS epidemic, larger deletions (82-nt and 415-nt deletion) were also identified in clusters of viruses from human isolates (He et al., 2004, Chiu et al., 2005). Initially, this dramatic genomic change in ORF8 has been proposed to contribute to the zoonotic transition of SARS-CoV from palm civets to humans and thus has attracted particular attention. However, it has been shown that palm civets are equally susceptible to human SARS-CoV isolates with or without the 29-nt deletion (Wu et al., 2005). Moreover, further studies using reverse genetics showed that the ORF8 of SARS-CoV is not essential for virus replication in vitro and in vivo (Yount et al., 2005, DeDiego et al., 2008). Thus, whether the mutations in ORF8 are due to genomic instability or adaptive evolution remains to be investigated (see Table 6\n).",

Although there is no data regarding the expression of 8a or 8b in vivo, Chen et al. have identified anti-p8a antibodies in two out of 37 patients with SARS (Chen et al., 2007). Also, different subcellular localizations have been reported for p8a, p8b, and p8ab. Using an EGFP fusion protein, Keng et al. have shown that p8a and p8b are found in cytoplasmic punctuated vesicle-like structures, whereas p8ab localizes diffusely to the cytoplasm (Keng et al., 2006). On the other hand, Law et al. have observed EGFP-fused p8b to localize diffusely in both the cytosol and the nucleus (Law et al., 2006). Finally, using a T7 promoter-driven expression system, Oostra et al. have demonstrated a reticular pattern and ER localization for p8a and p8ab, but a diffuse cytoplasmic localization for p8b (Oostra et al., 2007). These discrepancies should be addressed, possibly by using more specific monoclonal antibodies, or expressing 8a and 8b fusion proteins under a more physiologically relevant background, such as using recombinant coronaviruses.",

Owing to its N-terminal signal sequence, SARS-CoV p8ab enters the ER, where it is N-glycosylated at asparagine residue 81. The mature p8ab remains associated with the ER and possibly undergoes multimerization, but it is not transported to the Golgi for secretion (Oostra et al., 2007). Inside the ER, the protein up-regulates the synthesis of ER chaperons and activates the ATF6 branch of unfolded-protein response (UPR), but shows no effect on the PERK and IRE1 branches of the UPR (Sung et al., 2009). The 29-nt deletion disrupts the functional expression of ORF8. Although ORF8a contains the signal sequence, the protein is too short to be transported into the ER. For ORF8b, due to the lack of a signal sequence, it cannot enter the ER and thus is not glycosylated at the same asparagine residue as in 8ab (Oostra et al., 2007).",

Moreover, overexpression of 8a also induces caspase-dependent apoptosis (Chen et al., 2007). Ectopic expression of 8b reduces the level of co-transfected SARS-CoV E protein, but not that of other structural proteins. Strikingly, in SARS-CoV-infected cells, the expression of 8b and E are found to be mutually exclusive, indicating a functional antagonism between the two proteins (Keng et al., 2006). Similar to SARS-CoV p6, overexpression of 8b has been shown to stimulate DNA synthesis, although co-expression of p6 and 8b does not produce a synergistic effect (Law et al., 2006). The significance of these findings in SARS-CoV pathogenesis remains to be determined.",

The sgRNA9 also encodes the SARS-CoV N protein, and in fact ORF9b is a complete internal ORF within the N gene in an alternate reading frame (Xu et al., 2009). The 9b protein is detected in SARS-CoV-infected cells and the lung and ileum tissues from SARS patients (Nal et al., 2005). Moreover, anti-p9b antibodies are also detected in the serum of SARS patients (Qiu et al., 2005). These results indicate that SARS-CoV 9b is expressed in vitro and in vivo. Using sucrose gradient fractionation, Xu et al. have shown that p9b is incorporated into mature virions and packaged into VLPs when co-expressed with E and M proteins (Xu et al., 2009). These data indicate that p9b may be a structural component of SARS-CoV virions, but it is also possible that p9b is included during virus assembly due to interaction with E protein, as demonstrated by von Brunn et al. von Brunn et al. (2007). The SARS-CoV 9b protein is also shown to self-interact and interact with nsp5, nsp14, and the accessory protein p6, although the functional significances are not fully understood (von Brunn et al., 2007, Calvo et al., 2012). Several reverse genetic studies have demonstrated that p9b is not essential for SARS-CoV replication in vitro and in vivo (von Brunn et al., 2007, DeDiego et al., 2008) (see Table 7\n).",

Synthesis of the latter by the host enzyme oligo-2\u2032,5\u2032-A synthetase (OAS) is induced by double-stranded RNA intermediates occurring during viral replication, and leads to activation of the host\u2019s RNase L, which in turn degrades viral and cellular mRNA (Silverman, 2007). As a result, viral replication and protein synthesis are interrupted. Thus, reduction of 2-5A levels by NS2 constitutes a mechanism of subversion of the interferon-inducible OAS \u2013 RNase L pathway. Interestingly, this process is organ- and cell-type specific; NS2 is essential for replication of MHV A59 only in the liver, but not in the brain (Zhao et al., 2013). This seems to depend on the level of the IFN-induced expression of the OAS gene, which differs between cell types. The NS2 protein belongs to the superfamily of 2H phosphodiesterases that is characterized by the presence of a pair of conserved His-X-Thr/Ser motifs (Mazumder et al., 2002).",

            "text": "Betacoronaviruses of lineage a also include a haemagglutinin esterase (HE) gene between orf1ab and the S gene (Fig. 5). The hemagglutinin-esterases (HEs) are a family of viral envelope glycoproteins that mediate reversible attachment to O-acetylated sialic acids by acting both as receptor-binding (\u201clectins\u201d) and as receptor-destroying enzymes (RDEs) with esterase activity (Woo et al., 2010, Zhang et al., 1992, Vlasak et al., 1988, Schultze et al., 1991). In coronaviruses, this gene is exclusively present in betacoronaviruses of clade a and has probably been acquired after diverging from the ancestors of other betacoronavirus lineages (Zeng et al., 2008), possibly via horizontal gene transfer from Influenza C virus (Langereis et al., 2012). Crystal structures have been determined for the hemagglutinin esterases of BCoV and MHV (Vlasak et al., 1988, Schultze et al., 1991). The E domain (with esterase activity) is found to be highly conserved but the RBD (receptor binding domain) is found to be flexible (Vlasak et al., 1988). HCoV OC43 and BCoV use 9-O-acetylated sialic acids as receptor to initiate infection, and correspondingly possess sialate-9-O-acetylesterases as RDE. Most betacoronaviruses of lineage a attach to 9-O-acetylated sialic acid, but one group of murine coronaviruses has switched to using 4-O-acetylated sialic acid (Schultze et al., 1991). The available crystal structures reveal the adaptations of the RBD to differences in receptor usage (Vlasak et al., 1988, Schultze et al., 1991).",

Both the p4a and the p4b protein of MERS coronavirus have been shown to be a type-I interferon antagonists (Siu et al., 2014, Matthews et al., 2014, Niemeyer et al., 2013). The p4a is particularly interesting in this context, as it is a double-stranded (ds) RNA-binding protein that prevents dsRNA (which occurs as an intermediate of viral RNA replication) from binding to the cellular dsRNA-binding protein PACT, which, as a consequence, cannot activate the cellular dsRNA sensors RIG-I and MDA5 (Siu et al., 2014, Niemeyer et al., 2013). In another study, it has been shown that p4a, p4b and p5 are all potent interferon antagonists with p4a being the most powerful in counteracting the antiviral effects of IFN via the inhibition of both interferon production and ISRE (Interferon-Stimulated Response Element) promoter element signaling pathways (Yang et al., 2013). MERS coronavirus also contains an internal ORF within the nucleocapsid gene, which has not yet been characterized (van Boheemen et al., 2012). This ORF was not previously described for BtCoV-HKU4 and BtCoV-HKU5 but is conserved in the genome sequences of both viruses.",

However, recent sequencing of clinical isolates revealed the presence of a full-length p4, whereas laboratory strains show the presence of a truncated p4 (Farsani et al., 2012). It has been suggested that extensive culturing of HCoV 229E might have resulted in this truncation (Dijkman et al., 2006).

The genomic organization of a classic gammacoronavirus is 5\u2032-UTR-Pol-S-3a-3b-E-M-5a-5b-N-UTR-3\u2032 (UTR = untranslated region). Hence, it contains four accessory genes. The IBV sub-genomic mRNA 3 (sgRNA3) and sgRNA5 are known to be polycistronic (Liu et al., 1991, Liu and Inglis, 1992a, Liu and Inglis, 1992b). The sgRNA3 has been shown to be tricistronic and encodes 3a, 3b and E protein (previously known as 3c protein) (Liu et al., 1991, Liu and Inglis, 1991, Liu and Inglis, 1992a, Liu and Inglis, 1992b), whereas sgRNA5 is bi-cistronic and encodes 5a and 5b (Liu and Inglis, 1992a, Liu and Inglis, 1992b). Serial passages of IBV in Vero cells led to the emergence of a mutant IBV with a truncated 3b gene (Shen et al., 2003). The mutant virus is more virulent in chicken embryos, suggesting that the 3b protein may play a certain function in viral pathogenesis (Shen et al., 2003). Reverse genetics studies have shown that proteins 3a, 3b. 5a, and 5b are dispensable for viral replication (Hodgson et al., 2006, Casais et al., 2005). In non-classical Australian strains of IBV, accessory genes 3a and 3b were found to be replaced by the unrelated X1 gene, and 5a was lacking (Mardani et al., 2008). More recently, it has been demonstrated that a potential ORF situated between the M gene and gene 5a/b of IBV is transcribed through template-switching involving a non-canonical TRS, resulting in a 11-kD-protein of unknown function (Bentley et al., 2013).",

Five of the SARS-CoV accessory proteins (p3a, p6, p7a, p7b, and p9b) have been shown to be incorporated into mature virions and are thus minor structural proteins. Most SARS-CoV accessory proteins are involved in more than one cellular process, such as interfering with the MAP-kinase pathway, DNA synthesis, induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines, or induction of caspase-dependent apoptosis, to name just a few. The crystal structures of SARS-CoV accessory proteins 7a and 9b have been determined, providing a structural basis for their biological functions (Nelson et al., 2005, Meier et al., 2006). However, the pathophysiological significances of these accessory proteins in the context of SARS-CoV infection are not completely understood, and further structural and functional studies are required.",
