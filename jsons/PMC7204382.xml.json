The emerging virus rapidly became a challenge for global public health due to it spreading through human-to-human transmission. The majority of the earliest COVID-19 patients were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market. However, human-to-human transmission has frequently occurred, and the epidemic has been gradually growing (5). As of March 4, 2020, 80,566 laboratory-confirmed cases had been reported in China. Internationally, more than 14,396 cases had been reported in 77 countries (6, 7). The number of infected individuals is far surpassing that of SARS and MERS. SARS-CoV-2 can cause severe and even fatal respiratory diseases, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome. It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 is more likely to affect older males with comorbidities, suggesting that age, and comorbidity may be risk factors for poor outcomes (8, 9). In China, the reported death rate approached 3% of the total number of COVID-19 patients during February 2020.",

However, a relatively accurate evaluation of incidence and mortality is required to help refine the risk assessment and to ensure that the public and patients are managed in an effective way. Therefore, it is necessary to quantitatively evaluate the risks for individual groups of different ages and genders. In this paper, we report our initial analysis of the public data from local authorities. Our study shows that the incidence risk of COVID-19 might be as low as 0.1 for children, while it could be over 0.9 for 40-year-old adults. Our results also suggest that the mortality risk might be above 0.2 for patients older than 80 years. Notably, the mortality risk was significantly different between patients of Hubei province and those from other parts of China.",

Among the 76 fatal cases, 45 cases were reported as residents of Hubei province, and 31 cases were reported as residents of other parts of China. Epidemiological characteristics such as age, gender, and location were carefully checked to remove missing values or duplicated records. The composition of the age of the general public was obtained from data of 1,144,648 individuals from the General Census of China (2018) (10). The census data were collected from the whole country, including 31 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the Central Government.

In the previous study, the crude mortality rate was only 2.3%, but the rate was 3.7% on March 4, 2020 (3015 deaths among 80,566 identified COVID-19 cases). As of March 4, 2020, there were still 5,952 COVID-19 patients in critical condition in China. It has been reported that the survival probability of critically ill patients continuously decreased with the increase of time since admission to the intensive care unit (12). Our analysis was based on the composition of the age of the different populations, and therefore it is less affected by the disease progression of patients, especially the increasing death rate of critically ill patients. Age has been reported as the independent predictor of an adverse outcome in SARS and MERS. Comorbidities and low immune function in older people might be the major cause of a higher mortality of coronaviruses (3, 4, 11). Prompt administration of antibiotics to prevent infection and the strengthening of immune support treatment might reduce the mortality of seniors (8).",

            "text": "Our data showed that the mortality rate of COVID-19 is five times higher in Hubei province than that in other parts of China. This result is supported by an early publication that stated the estimated case fatality rate of mainland China excluding Hubei was 0.15%, far less than that of the Hubei province excluding the city of Wuhan (1.41%) and Wuhan city (5.25%) (13). On the one hand, this difference may be partially explained by insufficient medical resources due to such a large number of patients in Hubei Province during the outbreak. According to the 2018 annual brief report of the health service development in Wuhan city, there were 8.6 hospital beds per 1,000 people. However, hospital bed utilization ratio of 2017 and 2018 reached 92.34 and 94.22%, respectively (14). It was shown that, even under normal circumstances, there were few spare beds. On the other hand, detailed information on the majority of fatal cases (40 of 45 in total) from Hubei province was published before January 25, 2019. The mortality rate of early reported cases may be overstated, because case detection is highly biased toward the more severe cases. However, we strongly suggest that international authorities try their best to immediately prevent COVID-19 patients from overloading their health care system. Our hypothesis that a smooth-running health care system can effectively reduce the mortality rate of COVID-19 is strongly supported by the low mortality rate in other parts of China.",

Our data show a relatively low incidence risk for young people but a very high mortality risk for older adults. Therefore, it is prudent to strengthen the tertiary preventive and clinical care of old-aged patients to reduce mortality. Furthermore, our results also support the conclusion that a good medical service can effectively reduce the mortality rate of the viral infection to 1% or less. Our study could be of value to medical authorities to implement effective medical service. The lack of complete data for all COVID-19 cases potentially increases the occurrence of selection and measurement biases in this study. Therefore, further large-scale epidemiological studies are necessary to elucidate the risk factors of COVID-19 for the general public.",
