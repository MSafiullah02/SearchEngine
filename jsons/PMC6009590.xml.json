Conjugating cholesterol to an inhibitory peptide enhanced NiV antiviral activity up to 100-fold, by targeting the peptide to the plasma membrane [19, 29, 30]. We recently studied biophysical correlates of peptide antiviral properties using HPIV3 HRC-derived inhibitors [11, 30] joined to the lipid by a flexible PEG linker, which is soluble in both aqueous and organic media and therefore in both plasma/extracellular fluids and membranes, nontoxic and nonimmunogenic [11, 13].",

In this study, we determined the appropriate dose to target both upper and lower respiratory tract after i.n. NiV infection (Figure 2A). We selected 106 pfu in 100 \u00b5L, which was uniformly lethal by 13 days p.i., for further experiments. Hamsters were treated i.n. with the same volume of vehicle or peptide (10 mg/kg) on days \u22121, 0, and 1 of infection (Figure 2B). Peptide treatment improved survival, approaching 50% after 21 days, ie, *P = .02 for VIKI-dPEG4-Chol versus 100% lethality at 13 days in untreated animals. Both peptides, given only 3 times, were effective in the face of a high inoculum of NiV. VIKI-dPEG4-Toco was chosen over VIKI-dPEG4-Chol for primate studies because of its biodistribution, yielding the highest lung concentration with little systemic distribution [12], along with noninferior effect in hamsters. VIKI-dPEG4-Toco was also of interest based on our findings that tocopherol conjugation enhances potency against other paramyxoviruses, raising the possibility of a broad-spectrum protective peptide (data not shown).",

We used the combined s.c. and i.t. routes in comparison with i.t. alone because our previous studies showed that s.c. administration yields high serum and brain concentration in hamsters and mice [24, 33]. We aimed for prophylaxis via peptide retention in both upper and lower respiratory tract. The treatment was well tolerated, with no significant adverse effects related to administration. Peptide concentration was measured in serum, brain, and lung tissue from 2 animals for each administration route (Figure 3). After combined i.t. and s.c. administration, free peptide was detected in the serum at 8 hours, peaking at 500 nM before dropping below 300 nM after 24 hours, accompanied by peptide detection at 24 hours in both brain (10 nM) and lung (30\u2013200 nM). In contrast, after i.t. administration alone, serum peptide peaked at 200 nM shortly after administration (4 hours) and was undetectable at 24 hours. Peptide administered by the respiratory route thus concentrates effectively in the lungs, achieving 1000 nM at 24 hours. We determined whether peptide administration affected the level of IFN-I in serum of treated animals, because this might nonspecifically favor protection. A sensitive IFN-I bioassay performed with sera taken at 4 hours, 8 hours, and 24 hours posttreatment showed no increase in IFN-I in any of 4 tested animals (data not shown).",

Based on the heterogeneity of doses of NiV used to infect AGMs in previous work [8, 18, 34], and the protection from a high infectious dose of virus in hamsters, we set a high bar for antiviral prophylaxis. In animal studies performed by others after this primate experiment, AGMs succumbed to a much lower dose of NiV [18], suggesting that the dose we used exceeds 100% lethality by 3 logs. Peptide was given on days \u22121, 0, and daily until day 5 p.i. either i.t. or both i.t. and s.c. Treatment continued until day 10, using 10 mg/kg peptide i.t. and 2 mg/kg s.c. (Figure 4A).

The recombinant monoclonal antibodies that have been generated for passive immunoprophylaxis for HeV and NiV [36] are challenged by the target rural populations or a wider swath of exposed people in the event of global spread [37]. In the face of the potential for rapid evolution of paramyxoviruses and antibody-escape mutations, antivirals should be rapidly adjustable to address resistant or variant strains. A solution is needed that can be delivered to the target population in rural areas, even if that population expands vastly via human transmission. Inhaled administration of the peptide described here would provide such a solution.",

In this study, we modified a prototype peptide that exhibited prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy in vivo (VIKI-PEG4-chol), focusing on the role of the lipid moiety that tethers the peptide inhibitor to the target membrane. Cell-based experiments showed this peptide to be an effective NiV fusion inhibitor (Figure 1A) and stable to protease degradation (Figure 1B). The VIKI-dPEG4-Toco lipopeptide showed efficacy in intranasal prophylaxis of infection in hamsters with a very high inoculum of NiV. Both VIKI-dPEG4-Chol and VIKI-dPEG4-Toco (data not shown) reached high levels in the lung (and therefore could protect effectively) but do not concentrate in blood or reach the CNS. These features would be ideal for prophylaxis of uninfected persons as NiV and other pathogens escalate via direct bat-to-human and human-to-human spread [38\u201342].",

The sequence of the peptide regions that participate in the fusion intermediate is sufficient information to generate fusion inhibitors; this knowledge is already available for most viruses, or it can be inferred from the genetic information of the pathogen [43, 44]. In the case of viral evolution or emergence of a new strain, rapid development of a new antiviral based on a modified peptide sequence would be feasible. By our efforts to increase inhibitor potency by enhancing interaction between the peptide and the corresponding HRC domain, we expect to create a barrier to resistance [45\u201347]. Should tocopherol conjugation be proven to provide adequate human safety and pharmacokinetics, this strategy would likely extend to other tocopherol-conjugated peptides, because the peptide component is metabolized to component amino acids, and peptides are generally regarded as safe. Efficacy via an inhaled route of administration means that these antivirals are practical, feasible, and within reach for use in the field where outbreaks occur.",
