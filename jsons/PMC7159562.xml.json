The isolate was characterized by 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and a sequence containing 1432 nucleotides was compared for similarity with the GenBank database.

For antimicrobial susceptibility tests, we followed the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) standardized disk diffusion method 3. The isolate with 0.5 McFarland standard was inoculated onto Mueller\u2013Hinton agar with 5% blood and incubated at 35 \u00b0C. Zone diameters were read after 48 hours. Due to the lack of a zone diameter breakpoint for Janibacter spp., we used the zone diameter breakpoint for Corynebacterium spp. according to EUCAST clinical breakpoint tables. Disks of benzylpenicillin, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, vancomycin, clindamycin, and tetracycline were used, and isolates were shown to be \u201csusceptible\u201d to all agents except benzylpenicillin.

Gram stains for these strains are Gram\u2010variable or Gram\u2010positive with coccoidal to rod forms in singles, pairs, or irregular clumps 4. Although the natural habitat is not fully understood, members of the genus Janibacter have been recovered from various environments including environmentally polluted samples, melon, the midgut of mosquitoes, coral, sea sediment, and an air sample 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. Among Janibacter spp., J. hoylei was first isolated from cryotubes used to collect air samples in the upper atmosphere at an altitude of 40\u201341.4 km and was named after Sir Fred Hoylei, the renowned English astronomer, in 2009 2. The draft genome sequence of this strain was announced 10, but J. hoylei has been previously isolated. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of J. hoylei bacteremia and shows that J. hoylei can be isolated from not only high altitude environmental samples but also ground samples.",

The pathogen was identified in one case as J. melonis, and the other isolate was not identified 11, 12. Bacteremia caused by J. terrae has also been reported, with a total of four cases described in 2015 13. With the exception of one case caused by J. melonis in a healthy horse\u2010riding instructor, all five cases had underlying conditions, and three were diagnosed with hematologic malignancy. Therefore, Janibacter spp. may be considered an opportunistic pathogen in immunocompromised patients. However, the previously healthy patient case and our patient suggest that these strains can have pathogenic potential for bacteremia in relatively healthy patients without any other risk factors.",

However, clinical improvement was clear after treatment with vancomycin, and this finding makes the possibility of a contamination very unlikely. While the previously reported patients infected with other Janibacter spp. had a history of possible direct contact such as insect bite or catheter insertion 11, 13, our case was an 8\u2010week\u2010old infant without any medical or travel history and no known contact with Janibacter spp. The exact cause of such bacteremia is unclear; however, we can speculate with a skin colonization of his mother and later ingestion of this strain through breastfeeding.",

Although these methods could be helpful in identification of Janibacter spp., the only reliable and exact method for identification of Janibacter spp. is sequencing of 16S rRNA.

In a recent report, Fern\u00e1ndez\u2010Natal et al. applied the Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute method for antimicrobial susceptibility of coryneform organisms to J. terrae isolates and showed susceptibility to imipenem, vancomycin, linezolid, daptomycin, tetracycline, ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, gentamicin, and cotrimoxazole 13. In our case, J. hoylei showed susceptibility to ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, vancomycin, clindamycin, and tetracycline. While some differences can be shown in antimicrobial susceptibilities between Janibacter spp., the genus Janibacter is generally susceptible to vancomycin 4. Antibiotic therapy including vancomycin should be adequate treatment for Janibacter spp. infection even if antimicrobial susceptibility testing is not performed.",
