Virus budding was generally thought to depend on the interaction between the viral envelope proteins and the inner viral core or matrix components. However, some viruses, such as retroviruses and rhabdoviruses, are able to release membrane\u2010coated, virus\u2010like particles (VLPs) even in the absence of viral envelope proteins. Other viruses, including coronavirus and, in particular, hepadnaviruses, release empty subviral envelope particles that are devoid of nucleocapsids, in addition to infectious particles (Bruss, 2007; Welsch et al., 2007; Patient et al., 2009; Pincetic and Leis, 2009).",

            "text": "The prototype member of the hepadnavirus family is the hepatitis B virus (HBV), a small enveloped, DNA\u2010containing pararetrovirus causing acute and chronic liver infections. Worldwide an estimated 350 million individuals are chronically infected and potentially develop liver cirrhosis or liver cell carcinoma. The assembly of progeny HBV virions begins with the formation of icosahedral nucleocapsids that package the viral pregenomic RNA together with the viral polymerase. Inside the capsids, composed of 180 or 240 copies of the 21 kDa core protein and with about 30 nm in diameter, the partially double\u2010stranded 3.2 kb DNA genome is synthesized through reverse transcription of the pregenomic RNA. Mature nucleocapsids, formed in the cytoplasm, can then be enclosed by the viral envelope composed of cellular lipids and three viral glycoproteins, the small S, middle M and large L envelope protein that originate at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane (Bruss, 2007; Nassal, 2008; Patient et al., 2009). Subsequent budding of HBV is supposed to occur at intracellular membranes (Roingeard and Sureau, 1998; Rost et al., 2006). The production of infectious particles is accompanied by the formation of empty envelope particles that greatly outnumber mature virions and presumably act as decoys for the immune system. In addition, envelope protein\u2010independent core particle budding has been incidentally reported for HBV\u2010replicating cells (Beterams and Nassal, 2001; Perlman and Hu, 2003; Sun and Nassal, 2006; Watanabe et al., 2007; Wittkop et al., 2010). The functional implications and pathways of release of naked nucleocapsids remain enigmatic.",

            "text": "Like many other enveloped viruses, HBV release requires the recruitment of a network of cellular proteins normally involved in two analogous cellular membrane fission events, the budding of cargo\u2010containing vesiclesinto multivesicular bodies (MVBs) and the separation of daughter cells during cytokinesis (Kian Chua et al., 2006; Carlton and Martin\u2010Serrano, 2007; Lambert et al., 2007; Morita et al., 2007; Piper and Katzmann, 2007; Watanabe et al., 2007; Raiborg and Stenmark, 2009). This network, collectively called ESCRT (endosomal sorting complex required for transport), consists of ESCRT\u20100, \u2010I, \u2010II and \u2010III complexes together with the Vps4 ATPase and other associated proteins that seem to function in a sequential manner. The ESCRT machinery is essential for the sorting of cellular cargo proteins into internal MVB vesicles for either degradation, lysosomal functions or exosomal release (Morita et al., 2007; Piper and Katzmann, 2007). For budding and membrane fission, enveloped viruses recruit the ESCRT machinery through different prototype late domains (PT/SAP, PPxY, YPDL, FPIV) of their core and matrix proteins (Schmitt et al., 2005; Chen and Lamb, 2008; Pincetic and Leis, 2009). In case of HBV (genotype D), the core protein contains a late domain\u2010like PPxY sequence that mediates a productive interaction with the Nedd4 ubiquitin ligase (Rost et al., 2006). Nedd4 normally helps to sort ubiquitinated cargo proteins into MVBs and in such may link the HBV budding complex to the ESCRT network. This is corroborated by the findings that the functional inactivation of Nedd4, ESCRT\u2010III or Vps4 by overexpression of dominant\u2010negative (DN) mutants potently inhibits HBV budding (Kian Chua et al., 2006; Lambert et al., 2007; Watanabe et al., 2007). Whether all HBV genotypes and isolates, however, depend on the action of Nedd4 remains to be established, since the second proline residue of the PPxY motif is not strictly conserved among the core proteins (Chain and Myers, 2005).",

            "text": "Hepatitis B virus release can be also blocked by the overexpression of a DN mutant of Alix [apoptosis\u2010linked gene 2 (ALG\u20102)\u2010interacting protein X, also called AIP1] (Watanabe et al., 2007). Human Alix is a multifunctional adaptor and plays key roles in membrane biology, cytokinesis, cell signalling and the ESCRT\u2010dependent release of some enveloped viruses (Strack et al., 2003; Sakaguchi et al., 2005; Odorizzi, 2006; Raiborg and Stenmark, 2009). Alix consists of three distinct regions: the N\u2010terminal boomerang\u2010shaped Bro1 domain, the central V domain and the C\u2010terminal proline\u2010rich region (PRR). The Bro1 domain tightly interacts with the ESCRT\u2010III component CHMP4, while the PRR region serves as a docking site for a number of proteins, including the ESCRT\u2010I subunit Tsg101, endophilins, ALG\u20102 and the centrosome protein 55 (Odorizzi, 2006). The V domain of Alix can bind directly to the YPXL late domain type of viral proteins thereby serving as an adaptor to recruit the ESCRT machinery to virus budding sites (Martin\u2010Serrano et al., 2003; Strack et al., 2003). In case of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1, the Gag nucleocapsid domain can additionally associate with the Alix Bro1 domain (Dussupt et al., 2009; Popov et al., 2009). Besides its functions in virus budding, Alix along with its Bro1 region has been implicated to function in membrane remodelling processes (Kim et al., 2005; Fisher et al., 2007; Falguieres et al., 2008; Popov et al., 2009).",

We find that the release of naked (nucleo)capsids is not a by\u2010product of HBV replicating liver cell lines, but can be mimicked in cells expressing core alone. While Alix is dispensable for HBV production, it is essential for naked capsid egress. The Alix\u2010assisted exocytosis of non\u2010enveloped capsids may account for the hitherto less understood phenomenon why the HBV capsid is a potent B\u2010cell immunogen.",

            "text": "Previous studies have implicated that HBV\u2010replicating liver cell lines not only secrete virions but also non\u2010 or partially enveloped nucleocapsids (Beterams and Nassal, 2001; Perlman and Hu, 2003; Sun and Nassal, 2006; Watanabe et al., 2007; Wittkop et al., 2010). The origin of these capsids has been frequently attributed to \u2018exhausted/frustrated\u2019 or lysed cells that were programmed to replicate HBV at high levels. Here we readdressed the process of naked capsid release and investigated whether it depends on an ongoing replication. Therefore, a comparative analysis of core synthesis and capsid release was performed in the human hepatoma cell line HuH\u20107 transfected with the following HBV constructs: (i) pHBV, a replication\u2010competent construct in which the viral core/polymerase promoter was replaced by the human metallothionein IIa (hMTIIa) promoter, (ii) pCore, a plasmid harbouring the core open reading frame without the N\u2010terminal precore signal sequence under the control of the hMTIIA promoter, and (iii) pPDAF.Core, a construct identical to pCore except for an N\u2010terminal insertion of a DPAF\u2010epitope tag, which is recognized by the monoclonal antibody MA18/7 (Heermann et al., 1984). After transient expression for 3 days, cellular lysates and supernatants were harvested and (sub)viral particles present in the media were collected by ultracentrifugation. Lysates were examined by Western blotting using an antiserum against denatured core particles (K45) that specifically recognized the 21 kDa core protein (Fig. 1A). Because this antiserum often yields unspecific background staining, core was tagged with the DPAF\u2010epitope that led to a slightly decreased electrophoretic mobility of this construct. To probe for the release of non\u2010enveloped capsids into cellular supernatants, a capsid\u2010specific dot\u2010blot analysis was performed. Since the media of cells transfected with the replication\u2010competent HBV construct may contain complete virions plus non\u2010enveloped capsids, the analysis of this material under conditions of denaturing anti\u2010core Western blotting would not be meaningful. Therefore, the supernatants were examined with a capsid\u2010specific antibody (3HB17) under non\u2010denaturing conditions in order to solely detect non\u2010enveloped capsids. As shown in Fig. 1A, non\u2010enveloped capsids could be detected in either case. The evaluation of supernatants for lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity resulted in no indications for cytotoxicity. To monitor the sensitivity of the LDH assay, we used a plasmid expressing the vesicular stomatitis virus G glycoprotein (VSV\u2010G) that causes direct toxicity for a broad cell range (Licata and Harty, 2003). HuH\u20107 cells were transfected with control, pCore or VSV\u2010G constructs, transfection efficiencies were determined by immunofluorescence analysis, and cells were assayed for LDH. Upon adjustment of transfection rates, supernatants of about 25% transfected and core\u2010expressing cells showed a LDH level of 3.3%, while those of VSV\u2010G\u2010expressing cells displayed 20.8% LDH activity (Fig. 1B). Given the sufficient sensitivity of the LDH assay, these analyses revealed that the sole expression of the core protein is sufficient to render naked capsid release by a non\u2010lytic mechanism. Moreover, naked capsid egress is not restricted to human liver cell lines, since human embryonic kidney cells, human cervix carcinoma cells and even green monkey fibroblast cell lines also confer capsid release upon sole transfection with the core construct (data not shown).",

As diagrammed in Fig. 1C, the core proteins banded at density of 1.33 g ml\u22121, typical for native capsids (Beterams and Nassal, 2001). Next, antibody and protease accessibility studies of these capsids were performed. Because capsids reacted equally with capsid\u2010specific antibodies both in the presence and in the absence of detergent (Fig. 1D), and since they were sensitive to digestion with proteinase K even in the absence of detergents (Fig. 1E), the capsids are devoid of an evident lipid layer. Notably, this is in striking contrast to retro\u2010 and rhabdoviral VLPs that are enwrapped by a membrane during budding from cells (Welsch et al., 2007).",

To analyse whether naked capsid release may have similar requirements, we perturbed the ESCRT network in cells expressing only the core protein. For interference with ESCRT\u2010I functions, we depleted Tsg101 and Vps28, two subunits of the heterotetrameric ESCRT\u2010I complex. To impair ESCRT\u2010III and Vps4, ectopic overexpression of their DN mutant forms was used. ESCRT\u2010III subunits, like CHMP3, can be converted to a potent DN form by fusion with the yellow fluorescent protein (Babst et al., 1997). In case of Vps4, its two isoforms, Vps4A and Vps4B, can be blocked by overexpression of ATP hydrolysis\u2010deficient mutants (Babst et al., 1997; Yoshimori et al., 2000; Bishop and Woodman, 2001; Scheuring et al., 2001; Martin\u2010Serrano et al., 2003; Strack et al., 2003).",

As shown in Fig. 2A, both siRNAs effectively reduced the expression of their targets as compared with control siRNA\u2010treated cells. Moreover, consistent with published data (Stuffers et al., 2009), depletion of Tsg101 decreases the level of Vps28 and vice versa, likely because the ESCRT\u2010I complex loses its integrity upon depletion of one subunit. Under these conditions, the intracellular level of DPAF\u2010tagged core was unaffected. However, when culture media were analysed for capsid release, the loss of Tsg101 and Vps28 substantially increased capsid export (Fig. 2A). To account for the unaltered intracellular core levels, it seems conceivable that the loss of ESCRT\u2010I may have affected core protein expression. This would be consistent with the observation that Tsg101 has been implicated as a positive and negative regulator of gene transcription (Feng et al., 2000, and references therein).",

            "text": "Besides ESCRT\u2010III and Vps4, the ESCRT\u2010associated protein Alix had been implicated to assist in HBV budding. Watanabe et al. (2007) reported that an overexpression of a dsRed\u2010tagged Alix derivative in HBV\u2010replicating cells blocked virus formation. To re\u2010evaluate this observation, we first performed a similar experiment. In difference, we took use of an Alix mutant in which the C\u2010terminal PRR domain was replaced by GFP (Alix.GFP). As references, empty plasmid DNA or a construct encoding a haemagglutinin (HA)\u2010tagged version of WT Alix were included. After transient expression of these constructs with the HBV replicon, cell lysates and supernatants were assayed by immunocapture with anti\u2010capsid (K45) or anti\u2010envelope antibodies, respectively, followed by particle disruption and real\u2010time PCR measurement of the number of HBV genomes. Consistent with the earlier study (Watanabe et al., 2007), the exogenous expression of Alix.GFP substantially suppressed the production of intracellular nucleocapsids and extracellular virions, while WT Alix had no significant effect on HBV release (Fig. 3A). These results suggested that excess Alix.GFP acted in a DN manner and either directly or indirectly inhibited HBV formation. To specify the action of Alix.GFP, we analysed the fate of HIV.Gag whose budding requires the basic MVB machinery but not Alix (Garrus et al., 2001; Martin\u2010Serrano et al., 2003; Strack et al., 2003). Overexpressed Alix.GFP almost completely blocked the extracellular release of HIV.Gag particles (Fig. 3B), implicating that Alix.GFP appears to act as a global inhibitor of the MVB machinery and consequently of viral particle production. Since general MVB inhibitors have been shown to sequester their cargo into detergent\u2010insoluble complexes, co\u2010called aberrant endosomes (Yoshimori et al., 2000; Bishop and Woodman, 2001; Garrus et al., 2001; Strack et al., 2003), Alix.GFP may function in a similar manner, thereby reducing the intracellular pools of detergent\u2010soluble HBV nucleocapsids (Fig. 3A) and HIV.Gag (Fig. 3B). This finding led us to examine whether or not Alix may play a direct role in HBV budding. Therefore, cells were treated with specific siRNAs targeting Alix or control siRNAs prior to transfection with the HBV replicon. Cell lysates and supernatants were investigated as above and progeny HBV genomes were quantified by PCR. Although Alix was depleted by about 80% from the cells, its reduction had virtually no effect on HBV nucleocapsid formation and virus egress (Fig. 3C). Together, these data add further evidence that HBV budding depends on a functional MVB apparatus. However, HBV egress does not require Alix.",

To test whether Alix may directly contribute to naked capsid egress, we investigated the synthesis and release of core under conditions of overexpressing WT Alix. The WT and DPAF\u2010tagged core constructs were transfected either alone or together with the HA\u2010tagged Alix construct into HuH\u20107 cells. Cell lysates were probed by HA\u2010, core\u2010 and DPAF\u2010specific Western blotting to show synthesis of Alix and core (Fig. 4A). In fact, the extracellular levels of untagged and tagged cores were significantly higher when ectopically expressed Alix was present. Quantification analysis revealed that upregulated Alix enhanced core release about 10\u2010 to 12\u2010fold. Because high levels of Alix had been implicated to potentially promote apoptosis (Mahul\u2010Mellier et al., 2006), we performed cytotoxicity assays of supernatants that did not reveal any indications of cell damage and lysis. Thus, Alix overexpression profoundly increased the yield of extracellular core protein in a non\u2010lytic manner. Similar results were obtained upon Alix overexpression in HBV\u2010replicating cells. Here, supernatants of co\u2010transfected cells were subjected to a capsid\u2010specific immunoprecipitation (IP) followed by PCR analysis of the viral DNA. As shown in Fig. 4B, upregulated Alix stimulated naked nucleocapsid release about eightfold. By using this experimental approach, we also estimated the ratio between virions (via envelope\u2010specific IP) and naked nucleocapsids (via capsid\u2010specific IP) released from cells transfected with the HBV replicon alone and calculated a ratio 10:6 respectively.",

To substantiate this point, we analysed the fate of two core mutants, Core.K96A and Core\u0394PPAY, under conditions of excess Alix. A previous report had shown that both mutants are defective in capsid envelopment and virion formation (Ponsel and Bruss, 2003). However, Core.K96A is still able to form capsids, while mutations of the PPAY sequence blocked capsid assembly. As shown in Fig. 4C, the overexpression of Alix stimulated the release of Core.K96A but had no effect on Core\u0394PPAY. Of note, in this experiment the supernatants were concentrated by either ultracentrifugation or trichloroacetic acid (TCA) precipitation in order to screen for capsids or capsids plus core proteins respectively. From these data we conclude that Alix specifically increased the release of (nucleo)capsid particles rather than of core proteins.",

            "text": "To specify the Alix domain(s) responsible for the enhancement of naked capsid release, we constructed different Alix mutants. Human Alix consists of three regions: the Bro1 domain named for the apparent yeast homologue Bro1p [amino acid (aa) 1\u2013358], the V domain that is formed by two three\u2010helix bundles and folded in the shape of the letter V (aa 362\u2013702), and the PRR region (aa 703\u2013868) that serves as a docking site for a number of proteins, including Tsg101 (Strack et al., 2003; Sakaguchi et al., 2005; Odorizzi, 2006; Raiborg and Stenmark, 2009). Accordingly, deletion mutants were generated that lack either one or two of these domains (Fig. 6A). Alix also binds CHMP4 (ESCRT\u2010III) proteins through an exposed hydrophobic patch in the Bro1 domain with Ile212 and Leu216 being important (Fisher et al., 2007; Usami et al., 2007). Since the substitution of these residues by Asp inhibited CHMP4 binding, a correspondingly point mutant was made (Fig. 6A; Alix.DD). Next, co\u2010transfection studies using the DPAF\u2010tagged core were performed as above. As shown in Fig. 6B, the WT and mutant Alix proteins were expressed at equal levels and could be identified by their predicted molecular weights. By inspecting the amounts of PDAF.Core in lysates and capsids in supernatants, excess WT Alix accelerated capsid release as above. A comparable enhancing activity was observed for the Alix\u0394V and Alix\u0394PRR mutants, indicating that both V and PRR domains are dispensable. Similarly, the mutation of residues 212/216 (Alix.DD), the CHMP4 interactor sites of Alix, did not affect its capsid release\u2010promoting activity. Rather, as evidenced by the phenotypes of the Alix\u0394Bro1 and Bro1 mutants, the stimulation of HBV capsid egress strictly depends on the Bro1 domain. While the loss of the Bro1 domain abrogated enhanced capsid export, its sole overexpression is sufficient to enhance capsid release (Fig. 6B).",

Both Gags require the basic ESCRT machinery for budding, but only EIAV.Gag needs Alix (Garrus et al., 2001; Martin\u2010Serrano et al., 2003; Strack et al., 2003).

As shown in Fig. 6C, Alix\u0394Bro1 did not compromise either Gag release, indicating that it does not act in a DN manner, neither on endogenous Alix in particular nor on the ESCRT cascade in general.

In either setting, core yielded its typical cytoplasmic staining (Fig. 7B). Alix and its Bro1 domain were found mostly dispersed throughout the cytoplasm and, importantly, an overlay of the fluorescence patterns revealed a substantial degree of colocalization between core and Alix or Bro1 (Fig. 7B). Upon deletion of the Bro1 domain, the staining pattern completely changed, as Alix\u0394Bro1 appeared in aberrant structures that looked like large vesicles or aggregates. Consistent with the co\u2010precipitation studies, no colocalization could be detected for Alix\u0394Bro1 and core. To exclude the possibility that core colocalized with Alix and Bro1 simply due to their overall cytoplasmic dispersion, we analysed the degree of colocalization between core and a cytosolic marker protein. For this, an EGFP\u2010tagged version of the microtubule\u2010associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3B) was used that normally resides in the cytoplasm unless cells are induced for autophagy (Tanida et al., 2004). Although EGFP\u2010LC3B was distributed throughout the cytoplasm, we found only a marginal colocalization with core (Fig. 7B). Accordingly, the merged signals obtained for Alix/core and Bro1/core were likely to present at least partial colocalization of the proteins.

For the related duck HBV core protein, it had been shown to partition between the soluble and membrane fraction even in the absence of the viral envelope (Mabit and Schaller, 2000). To evaluate whether the HBV core shares a similar intrinsic membrane binding capacity, membrane flotation analyses were performed (Fig. 8B). For control purposes, GFP was used as a soluble protein, while the Rab7 GTPase served as a reference for a soluble and membrane\u2010associated protein. Transfected cells were subjected to membrane flotation and flotation fractions were analysed by immunoblotting. As expected, the GFP signal was found exclusively in the high\u2010density phase of the gradient. Rab7 was detected in both high\u2010and low\u2010density phases consistent with its soluble and membrane\u2010associated forms. A similar distribution phenotype was observed for the core protein, indicating that a fraction of core is targeted to cellular membranes. Importantly, upon depletion of Alix core is also associated with membranes, implicating that Alix is per se not essential for the core/capsid membrane targeting. A close inspection and comparison of the core distribution profile in siControl\u2010 and siAlix\u2010treated cells, however, revealed that the pool of membrane\u2010associated core increased when Alix was depleted, suggesting that Alix may affect the portion of membrane\u2010bound core (Fig. 8B).

In this work, we have challenged the underlying mechanism(s) and find that naked core particles are efficiently exported in vitro even in the absence of a replicating HBV genome.

Regardless of which late domain they encode, these viruses in common depend on the late acting ESCRT components, ESCRT\u2010III and Vps4, which drive the fission reaction (Chen and Lamb, 2008; Pincetic and Leis, 2009; Raiborg and Stenmark, 2009). In most cases, the ESCRT\u2010dependence of a specific virus not only applies to the release of the infectious particle but also to VLPs. For example, budding of retroviral Gag VLPs or Sendai virus matrix VLPs have the same ESCRT requirements as their cognate virions (Garrus et al., 2001; Sakaguchi et al., 2005; Irie et al., 2010). HBV appears to be a remarkable exception of this scheme, since virus budding requires ESCRT\u2010III and Vps4 (Kian Chua et al., 2006; Lambert et al., 2007; Watanabe et al., 2007), while naked capsid budding does not. Intriguingly, we find that the loss or mutation of ESCRT components even enhances naked capsid egress. ESCRT\u2010independent budding has been reported for some viruses, like vesicular stomatitis virus, influenza virus and respiratory syncytial virus, that are not sensitive to DN Vps4 (Irie et al., 2004; Chen et al., 2007; Utley et al., 2008). However, a functional inactivation of ESCRT does not enhance the budding efficiency of these viruses, as it is case for HBV capsids.",

First, the ESCRT machinery normally serves as a quality control system and sorts unneeded cargo into MVBs for lysosomal destruction (Piper and Katzmann, 2007; Raiborg and Stenmark, 2009). Core proteins synthesized in the absence of an ongoing HBV replication may present waste material, destined for degradation in lysosomes. Hence, if ESCRT\u2010mediated protein sorting is blocked, core may escape lysosomal breakdown with the consequence that more core is available for ESCRT\u2010independent release pathways. However, according to our immunofluorescence studies that did not reveal any colocalization between core (if synthesized alone) and the MVB/lysosome marker LPBA, we do not favour this interpretation. Rather, the inactivation of the ESCRT cascade may render more functional Alix available to guide capsid egress. Although the genuine function of Alix in MVB sorting is less clear, Alix is known to interact with Tsg101 and CHMP4 (Strack et al., 2003; Fisher et al., 2007; Usami et al., 2007; McCullough et al., 2008). The loss of these interactors by either RNA silencing or overexpression of DN ESCRT\u2010III/Vps4 mutants (Fig. 2) concomitant with a sequestration of the entire ESCRT machinery at aberrant MVBs (Garrus et al., 2001; Strack et al., 2003) could increase the availability of Alix, a situation reminiscent to overexpressed Alix.",

Bro1 domains are expected to have a similar boomerang shape and some Bro1 domains are functionally exchangeable, as it was shown in a minimal HIV\u20101 Gag release assay in which both, the Bro1 domain of Alix and Brox, stimulated VLP release (Popov et al., 2009).",

Because the Alix/Cep55 interaction is essential for abscission during cytokinesis (Carlton and Martin\u2010Serrano, 2007; Morita et al., 2007), whereas the Alix/ALG\u20102 interaction is a prerequisite for induction of apoptosis (Mahul\u2010Mellier et al., 2006), we infer that neither of these mechanisms contributes to the enhancement of capsid release by upregulated Alix. The CHMP4 binding site in Alix is also not required for HBV capsid budding. Structural and functional studies have revealed that L212D and I216D point mutations of Alix abolished its interaction with CHMP4 and its function in ESCRT\u2010dependent virus budding and cytokinesis (Carlton and Martin\u2010Serrano, 2007; Fisher et al., 2007; Morita et al., 2007; Usami et al., 2007).

The different use of cell functions by HBV viral and capsid particles is puzzling and poses the question how the virus may orchestrate these pathways. One critical determinant assigning the budding pathway may be the stage of capsid maturation. During virus budding, only mature nucleocapsids containing the DNA genome can be packaged by the viral envelope proteins while immature (nucleo)capsids with pregenomic RNA, nucleic acid intermediate forms or no nucleic acid are excluded from envelopment (Gerelsaikhan et al., 1996; Pairan and Bruss, 2009). The nature of the maturation signal has not been unequivocally identified, but appears to involve the phosphorylation degree and conformation state of the capsid (for review, Bruss, 2007). Hence, mature nucleocapsids may gain access to ESCRT\u2010dependent HBV budding either directly, via capsid/envelope interactions, or indirectly with the help of cellular factors. Such factors could be \u03b32\u2010adaptin and Nedd4, two ESCRT\u2010associated proteins that interact with the core protein and guide HBV formation (Rost et al., 2006; Lambert et al., 2007).

Hence, Alix appears to act at late steps of naked capsid budding, possibly when premade capsids are tethered to membranes. Our observation that the Bro1 domain of Alix is sufficient for both binding to the core protein and enhancing capsid release, it may be recruited by core in order to remodel membranes. In view of the crystal structures of the Bro1 domain of Alix and its yeast homologue Bro1 (Kim et al., 2005; Fisher et al., 2007), the Bro1 domain is an attractive candidate for a component of a negative curvature sensing system. By binding to membranes with its convex surface, the boomerang\u2010shaped Bro1 domain of Alix could contribute directly to the generation of negative curvature required for budding away from the cytosol. An inherent membrane\u2010deforming ability of isolated Bro1 domains was recently suggested by Popov et al. (2009) who showed that these domains can promote VLP release of a minimal HIV\u20101 Gag construct, even when their CHMP4 binding sites \u2013 and hence their access to the MVB machinery \u2013 were disrupted. By deforming membranes at HBV capsid budding sites, Alix may simultaneously function as an adaptor recruiting components that are needed for the final liberation of the capsids from the cell. Based on the close relationship between Alix and lipids (Odorizzi, 2006; Falguieres et al., 2008), candidates for such components could be lipids with fusogenic properties, lipid modulators and lipases. Because extracellular capsids are seemingly coatless, their egress may involve processes of membrane rupture. Such mechanisms have been described to accompany the morphogenesis of vaccinia virus (Chlanda et al., 2009). Understanding how Alix mechanistically operates during HBV capsid budding will be an important next step forward.",

Naked capsids are hardly found in the blood of infected patients or chimpanzees (Possehl et al., 1992). Noteworthy, however, the (nucleo)capsid or core antigen [also referred to hepatitis B core antigen (HBcAg)] is extremely immunogenic and high titres of anti\u2010HBc antibodies are produced in virtually all patients who have been exposed to HBV. The potent immunogenicity of HBcAg is due, at least in part, to the fact that it can function as a T\u2010cell\u2010independent antigen and directly binds and activates B\u2010cells to produce antibodies (Milich and McLachlan, 1986; Milich et al., 1997). Accordingly, naked (nucleo)capsids must exist in vivo, but may be rapidly cleared from extracellular fluids by phagocytosis, endocytosis and/or degradation. The origin of free extracellular HBcAg/core particles is not yet clear. They may originate from HBV\u2010infected cells killed by cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL). In transgenic mice and cell culture systems, it has been shown that cytoplasmic nucleocapsids can survive apoptosis, induced by CTLs or artificial stimuli, and persist in the extracellular milieu (Pasquetto et al., 2000; Arzberger et al., 2010). However, as shown in this study, it seems equally possible that extracellular capsids originate from core\u2010producing cells by a non\u2010lytic, Alix\u2010mediated exocytosis mechanism. In either case, extracellular core particles are competent to prime B\u2010 and T\u2010cells (Milich and McLachlan, 1986) and in such advantageous for the infected host. Accordingly, it is tempting to speculate that the Alix\u2010assisted capsid release may resemble a host cellular defence mechanism.",
