We're all learning all the time and adjusting our strategy, based on the latest available evidence. We can only say what we know, and we can only act on what we know. (1) In a previous paper,(2) this author attempted to assess potential COVID-19 continent-based mortality based on initial WHO data from China which estimated that 14% of infected cases are severe and require hospitalisation, 5% of infected cases are very severe and require intensive care admission, mostly for ventilation, and 4% of infected die. (3) However, it is becoming increasingly clear that a significant proportion of circulating COVID positive patients are asymptomatic, with potential for transmission of disease.(4) This may be circa 80-90% of COVID in community.(4)",

The only way to mitigate these numbers is to apply social distancing and take the precautions outlined by public health such as hand washing with soap, masks and so on. It must be reiterated that these are best guesses and estimates that preclude the discovery of effective treatment and/or vaccination.",
