            "text": "The idea of viruses as inert molecular entities has progressively been transformed since scientists began to discover the myriad of interactions that occur during the intracellular phase of virus life. Restricted by their own limited genetic repertoire, viruses need to use a number of cell factors for genome replication and morphogenesis. Identification of these factors is essential for understanding the virus morphogenetic processes that often take place in intracellular structures known as viral inclusions, virosomes or viral factories. Viruses are generally thought to build these structures to recruit and concentrate viral and cell factors needed for replication and assembly; they are able to modify a variety of cell organelles and to create new inter-organelle contacts (Fig. 14.1). In the mammalian cell, virus assembly can start inside the nucleus, in association with components of the secretory pathway (Golgi, endoplasmic reticulum or ER), at different points in the endocytic pathway (endosomes, multivesicular bodies or MVB) or at the plasma membrane. Mitochondria and cytoskeletal elements are present in the factories built by many different viruses.\n",

This strategy appears to allow viruses to generate progeny with maximum efficiency in the use of cell resources. It is also thought that viruses can use these scaffolds to protect themselves from cellular antiviral defences [2]. Viral factories were first described for large DNA viruses such as the African swine fever virus (ASFV) and the poxviruses; we now know that many DNA and RNA viruses build factories in the cytosol, in the nucleus, or both. Due to our limited knowledge of cell nucleus organisation, characterisation of nuclear viral factories is only beginning. In contrast, viral factories assembled in the cytosol are being studied extensively and there are many reports on their architecture and activities. Inside these cytosolic factories, morphogenesis of new viruses begins with the transport of replicated genomes from the structures that harbour the replication complexes (RC) to the assembly sites. Depending on the virus, a number of maturation steps will follow (see 10.1007/978-94-007-6552-8_13 for details) before new viral particles are ready for delivery and propagation.",

            "text": "A number of new techniques can be applied to study interactions between viruses and cells on a genomic scale [3]. Microarrays are being used to identify mRNA transcription patterns in different phases of the virus life cycle. DNA gene chips detect differences in gene expression between uninfected and virus-infected cells and at different infection stages. Gene data bases are then useful for associating the genes identified with specific cell pathways [4, 5]. High-throughput screening based on RNA interference (RNAi) is another category of methods that analyse gene expression patterns. RNAi is an RNA-dependent gene silencing process within living cells that is often exploited to study the function of genes. This emerging technology is used to study how viruses interact with their hosts at the molecular level. Analysis at various times post-infection has identified a number of cell factors potentially involved in viral morphogenesis, for example for dengue [6], influenza [7] and retroviruses [8]. RNAi may be used for large-scale screens that systematically shut down each gene in the cell. Studies using this approach have shown a requirement for cell factors such as the ESCRT machinery for assembly of the human immunodeficiency virus, HIV [9].",

            "text": "The group of techniques termed proteomics includes powerful methods to study protein-protein interactions. The yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) assay system remains one of the most amenable techniques and is widely used to search for virus-host interactions. Y2H works by expressing two candidate proteins in the yeast cell. Bait and prey proteins are fused either to a promoter-specific DNA-binding domain or to a transcription activation domain. Interaction between the two proteins in the yeast nucleus brings both domains together so that they can initiate expression of a reporter gene [10]. Individual bait proteins can be screened for interaction with a library of prey proteins. Genome-scale Y2H studies were used to identify 314 virus-host interactions for HCV [11] 109 interactions for vaccinia virus [12] and nine for HIV-1 [13]. Similar techniques, such as the yeast three-hybrid system, can be used to study interactions between nucleic acids and proteins [14, 15]. This group of methods also includes pull-down and immunoprecipitation assays, and tandem affinity purification (TAP) tagging approaches, as well as protein identification by quantitative and semi-quantitative mass spectrometry. Whereas Y2H usually detects transient interactions, affinity-tag purification mass spectrometry shows stable, stoichiometric complexes. Since cell proteins often incorporate into viral particles, these techniques can be applied to the study of protein-protein interactions in the infected cell and in purified viral assembly intermediates [16]. This is the case of clathrin, for example, which was found in retrovirus particles; clathrin was only recently identified as one of the cell factors that facilitate accurate morphogenesis of several retroviruses [17]. Y2H technology also detected cell proteins that interfere with virus assembly and viral proteins that block them. This is the case of tetherin, first detected by proteomics and mass spectrometric protein identification as a cell factor that restricts retrovirus assembly [18], and later confirmed as a restriction factor for a wide variety of enveloped viruses [19]. Viruses have several anti-tetherin proteins to counteract the effect of this factor [20]. The current challenge of high-throughput technologies is to develop more efficient informatics tools to accurately analyse the vast amount of information they can provide [21].",

Light microscopy (LM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) provide different types of information about viral infection, ranging from general events that involve the whole cell to the detailed imaging of nascent and maturing viral particles in specific cell compartments [22] (Fig. 14.2). With resolutions in the 100\u2013500 nm range, LM shows organelle recruitment and modification in the assembly compartment and, in the case of the largest viruses, individual new viral particles as well [23]. In immunofluorescence assays using antibodies to viral proteins and cell compartments, we can see where viral structural and scaffolding proteins (10.1007/978-94-007-6552-8_11) concentrate to create the assembly sites. Light microscopy shows, for example, that the same virus can build distinct factories in different cell types, depending on specific characteristics of the cell (Fig. 14.2a, b). Functional viruses that express proteins fused with clonable fluorescent tags such as the green fluorescent protein (GFP) (see Sect. 14.3 for details) can be followed in live cells [24]. Video microscopy facilitates dynamic characterisation of the biogenesis of the factory and virus assembly in real time. Time course experiments with antibody-labelled permeabilised cells or video microscopy studies with GFP fusions in living cells are essential for selecting specific conditions, such as the best times p.i., for more detailed, higher resolution study by TEM.\n",

TEM of infected cells shows that mitochondria, endomembranes and cytoskeleton often participate in organising the structure that supports viral assembly. To complete maturation and become infectious, immature viral particles must often travel within the factory to find specific cell factors.

Given that eukaryotic cells are several microns in diameter, the ultra-thin sections are single planes of much larger structures. For conventional TEM, cells are fixed on culture plates and collected by low speed centrifugation, followed by sectioning of the pellet. In these conditions, cells preserve their morphology but present a variety of orientations (Fig. 14.3a); analysis is therefore restricted to random, unique sections of cells, and scarce or non-randomly distributed elements can be missed completely. Oriented serial sections solve this problem (Fig. 14.3b). By collecting all serial sections from each cell, all intracellular elements can be detected and studied. This strategy guarantees a complete analysis without missing any intracellular event of interest; immunofluorescence can assist by localising where viruses are assembled within a cell and thus, where cells should be sectioned for TEM [22]. The study of oriented serial sections is very informative and has revealed unreported contacts between cell organelles, RC and assembly sites, as well as the relationships of different viral intermediates with specific cell elements (Fig. 14.3c). After image processing and segmentation to assign identities to all individual structures in the images, serial sections can be aligned and combined in 3D reconstructions [27]. With resolution values of ~5 nm in the X and Y axes, these 3D reconstructions can show viruses in factories with considerable detail (Fig. 14.3d, e). Resolution in the Z axis is limited, however, with values of ~50\u2013100 nm due to imperfections in the alignment process.\n",

These microscopes use a focused beam of high-energy electrons to generate a variety of signals at the surface of solid specimens. Samples are covered by a thin layer of metal and scanned with a primary source of electrons; secondary electrons are then released from the sample surface and collected by a detector. The signals derived from electron-sample interactions furnish information about the sample, including external morphology in 3D. Modern scanning electron microscopes can now provide resolutions as precise as 2\u20135 nm, near that achieved by cellular electron microscopy [28]. SEM images can show morphological changes in large virus particles during maturation in situ; this is the case, for example, of the giant mimivirus (Fig. 14.4a, b). In lysed cells and isolated virus factories visualised by SEM, immature viruses are clearly distinguished at short times p.i.

Higher resolutions of ~1 nm have been reported, as was the case of the budding HIV viral particles visualised by cryo-electron microscopy on the surface of intact human cells [31]. Both normal and aberrant budding events were visualised on the cell surface, suggesting that cellular and/or viral factors control the quality of virus assembly and maturation. A limitation of cellular tomography is that the maximum thickness of the sample must be <0.5 \u03bcm, whereas virus factories are larger; however, conventional TEM methods like those described above can help to select specific elements within cells for more detailed ET structural analysis. Thanks to ET, elusive structures have been visualised for the first time, such as the transfer of viral genomes from RC to assembly sites in dengue virus-infected cells [32] (Fig. 14.5a, b). The morphogenesis of poxviruses is another good example; vaccinia virus (VV) assembly and architecture were the subject of numerous studies, but the organisation and biogenesis of immature and mature VV particles were not understood until the first ET studies were carried out [33, 34]. These analyses showed unprecedented remodelling of cell endomembranes during VV particle assembly (Fig. 14.5c, d). Tomograms are analysed in detail in computational slices of 1\u20132 nm extracted from the original volumes (Fig. 14.5a). As with serial sections in conventional TEM, the relevant information is contained in these single planes, whereas 3D representations are models used to summarise the most relevant features in the tomograms (see 10.1007/978-94-007-6552-8_3 for details).\n",

Antibodies have been and are still fundamental tools in electron microscopy [36, 37]. When immunolabelling proteins on cryosections, where cells have not been dehydrated and maintain their proteins in a natural hydrated state, the sensitivity of antibody detection is usually higher than that obtained when labelling sections of dehydrated, resin-embedded cells. Since the introduction of cryosectioning, the method has been improved and perfected [38, 39].

If proteins fused to a fluorescent tag maintain their normal functions, their movements and interactions with intracellular structures can be tracked in living cells (Fig. 14.6d). In conjunction with the new generation of LM methods, we can even follow the assembly of individual virus particles at real time [41]. GFP is a relatively large molecule (27 kDa) and, since viral proteins have very strict structural requirements, fusion to GFP can produce loss of function. If this is the case, probes smaller than GFP could be a viable option. The group of smaller probes includes the fluorescent flavoprotein known as miniSOG, which is less than half the size of GFP [42], or the smaller tetra-cysteine motifs, which are visualised after incubation with fluorescent biarsenical molecules such as ReAsH or FlAsH [43].",

Virus factories and aggresomes both assemble at the MTOC, recruit mitochondria and cell chaperones, build a cage with vimentin filaments, and are maintained by the activity of dynein motors on microtubules. EM shows membranes, ribosomes, viral intermediates and fully assembled viruses inside the vimentin cage of the ASFV aggresome-like factory (Fig. 14.7b).

The secretory pathway is the most common target for this virus-induced membrane remodelling, while the endocytic pathway also participates in some cases (Fig. 14.1). The two pathways are closely related, in fact, and converge at the trans-Golgi compartment. Described in the literature with many different names, the membranous tubuloreticular structures (TBS) often detected in infected cells are indeed cubic membranes that consist of highly curved, 3D-folded lipid bilayers. Alterations in cholesterol metabolism are linked to the biogenesis of cubic membranes, used for assembly by some viruses such as the SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) coronavirus [49]. Other viruses depend on phosphatidylcholine synthesis, fatty acid synthesis or geranylation. The highly curved nature of cubic membranes, possibly induced by multiple interactions between replicase proteins, might assist virus budding. Virus replication often slows secretion, however, which means that viruses can interfere with membrane trafficking proteins and their regulation by small GTPases [2, 47]. Additional host factors involved in virus-induced membrane remodelling include the SNARE (soluble NSF attachment protein receptor) proteins, which are mediators of vesicle fusion used by the human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), the VAMP-associated proteins (VAP) that bind to SNARE and are used by hepatitis C virus, and the ESCRT (endosomal sorting complex required for transport), which are essential for HIV assembly in the plasma membrane [19, 47, 50].",

Using a variety of technical strategies, these new technologies have begun to provide insights into cell biology and virology. In particular, real-time imaging methods that track individual virus particles in living cells are being used to study virus assembly, and super-resolution microscopy has already defined interactions with cell factors during HIV-1 budding [55, 56].

From the conventional techniques used to characterise infection kinetics to the new developments in proteomics, genomics, bioinformatics and microscopy, research in this field is generating a vast amount of information about how viruses manage to assemble all the machinery needed to build infectious particles from viral macromolecules and cell materials. Relevant examples on what is being learned on the participation of host cell factors in virus assembly have been described in this chapter by focusing on studies with a few representative model systems. Future work must be accompanied by studies of how cells position their proteins and regulate organelle shape, size and movement. By understanding how viruses manipulate these processes, we will not only learn about viruses but also about cell architecture and compartmentalisation of functions.\n",
