            "text": "Inflammatory vasculopathies encompass a heterogeneous group of diseases characterized by inflammation and typical necrosis of vessel walls that differ with respect to their clinical and histological features, patterns of vessel involvement, and degree of severity. The presence of consistent histopathological changes is considered sufficient for a diagnosis of immune-mediated vasculitis. 2 Where active lesions are not sampled, as in the cat reported here, residual histopathological changes with consistent clinical signs may be reliably interpreted as being the result of previously active vascular inflammation. 8 The time delay between onset of disease and sampling in the cat reported here could account for the absence of demonstrable immunoglobulin in blood vessel walls. 9, 10 Immunostaining for immune complex deposition in the basement membrane can provide further evidence for the diagnosis but has variable sensitivity. 2 In both human and veterinary species, at least 50% of cases of vasculitis are classified as idiopathic. 8, 11 However, drug-induced immune complex-mediated vasculitis is well recognized, and a temporal relationship with drug administration can be identified in dogs and cats. 8 Immune complexes in these cases constitute antigens derived from the parent drug or its metabolites coupled with host antibodies produced in response to these antigens. More recently, it has been suggested that the inflammation in some drug-induced vasculitides is associated at least in part with activation of neutrophils by circulating antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibodies. 12 This cause remains to be documented clinically in veterinary species. In virtually all instances, the diagnosis of an adverse drug reaction remains presumptive. Confirmation by repeat administration is ethically questionable and could have very serious and potentially fatal consequences.",

            "text": "Cutaneous signs are the most common clinical signs associated with immune complex-mediated vasculitis and can occur either as part of a localized process or as the most prominent and severe manifestation of systemic vasculitis. As in the cat reported here, skin overlying the extremities, including pinnae and feet, and over pressure points, including hocks, is most commonly affected. 2 A number of noncutaneous clinicopathological changes are identified in animals with systemic vasculitis, including hematological disorders such as anemia, thrombocytopenia and neutrophilia, protein-losing nephropathy, retinal changes, and musculoskeletal abnormalities. 2, 3, 13, 14 Anemia, thrombocytopenia, and neutrophilia were all present in the cat under study, and the abdominal fluid identified was presumed to be secondary to intraperitoneal vasculitis. 15 The marked anemia at presentation was suspected to be principally secondary to immune-mediated hemolysis, although a blood loss component could not be excluded. Vasculitis-induced disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) was thought to be predominantly responsible for the coagulopathy identified at presentation, and the thrombocytopenia was most likely due to both DIC and aggregation at sites of endothelial injury. 16, 17 Differential diagnoses included cold agglutinin disease, cryoglobulinemia, and coronavirus-induced systemic vasculitis. Cold agglutinin disease has been rarely reported in cats and was excluded on the basis of histopathology that was highly suggestive of primary vasculitis, the presence of marked hemolysis that is reportedly rare in this condition, and the proximal distribution of the tail pathology. 18 Clinicopathological findings consistent with cryoglobulinemia, such as white flocculent material in blood smears, centrifuged hematocrit tubes, or cooled serum, were not identified in this cat, and coronavirus antibody titer was negative. 19 As with any adverse drug reaction, the administration of the suspected inciting agent must be discontinued in animals with drug-induced immune complex-mediated vasculitis and repeat administration must be avoided. Withdrawal of the agent does not always lead to rapid resolution, and treatment is therefore designed to modulate the inflammatory and immunogenic processes involved in the pathogenesis. 11 Corticosteroids are the most widely employed agents in the treatment of vasculitis because of their dose-dependent anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects. 8, 11 Immunosuppressive dosages are generally required to induce remission but treatment is then tapered to the minimum effective dose. Relapse after withdrawal of treatment is not uncommon. 11 Concomitant use of an additional immunosuppressive agent such as chlorambucil allows corticosteroids to be used more sparingly, thereby minimizing the associated adverse effects. 8, 11 Pentoxifylline is a methylxanthine derivative with a variety of effects that include hemorheological, anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, profibrinolytic, and antithrombotic properties. 20, 21 It has been used in a variety of diseases in humans, including a number of vasocclusive and cutaneous disorders, and its use in dogs with dermatological conditions has also been reported. 20, 21, 22, 23 The use of pentoxifylline in the treatment of vasculitis is reported in both humans and dogs. 20, 22 However, despite anecdotal reports of its clinical use in cats (Personal communication, Filippo de Bellis), to the authors' knowledge, no case reports exist in the veterinary literature on the use of pentoxifylline in the treatment of vasculitis in a cat. In dogs, a dosing regime of 15 mg/kg PO q8h may be most efficacious, but similar recommendations are not available for cats. 22 Both the dose and the dosing interval in the cat reported here were modified based on cat compliance. The drug appeared to be well tolerated with no clinical adverse effects reported during treatment.",
