Annually, more than 100,000 people in the USA die from septic shock, the most severe form of sepsis, which thereby represents the most common cause of death in the intensive care unit (ICU). Morbidity and mortality of severe sepsis are usually ascribed to incorrect or delayed diagnosis, inadequate antimicrobial therapy and underlying illnesses [2, 3] . More recently, the host-specific immune response has been shown to be another important determinant of outcome of infectious diseases [4] . Genetically-determined differences in immune responses might explain why some people get sick and die when they encounter a pathogen whereas others stay perfectly healthy.

Genetic factors differentiate inbred strains, and epigenetic factors elicit variations within a strain. In this regard, the prevalence of genetic strain differences, contributing to susceptibility to microbial infections has been well recognized in rodents. These models, essentially mice, are genetically well defined and may be easily genetically-modified (using genetically-engineered strains such as knock-outs) to demonstrate the physiological importance of a suspected gene [4, 11, 12] . The interest in studies of mice lies in the fact that nearly all of the murine genes involved in the response to sepsis have human homologs. Analysis of susceptibility to certain infectious diseases in mice has led to the mapping and identification of candidate genes for human studies. Hence, some groups have shown that Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) knock-out mice do not respond to Staphylococcus aureus infection. After bacterial challenge, these mice have decreased production of cytokines, increased concentration of bacteria in blood and kidneys, and a higher mortality rate than wild-type mice [13, 14] . Similarly, when infected by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, TLR2 knock-out mice have deficient bacterial clearance and develop chronic pneumonia [15] . Interestingly, similar susceptibility to S. aureus infection and tuberculosis have been reported in human populations carrying TLR2 polymorphisms [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] .

Three different alleles, resulting in structurally variant proteins, have been identified in codons 52, 54 and 57 of the exon 1 of the MBL gene. Structural variants within the MBL gene are common, with frequencies ranging between 0.11 and 0.29, and reduce complement activation independent of the MBL plasma level.

In particular, G to C inversions at position \u2212550 or \u2212221 in the promoter region are associated with varying expression levels of MBL. Furthermore, these SNPs are always linked with the structural variants in most populations creating relevant haplotypes. As an example, the median serum concentrations of MBL for Caucasians were found to be 1,630 ng/ml for wild-type genotype; 358 ng/ml in patients heterozygous for the codon 54 mutation; and 10 ng/ml in patients homozygous for the codon 54 mutation.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 367, "end": 371, "text": "[43]", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 1036, "end": 1040, "text": "[43]", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Mannose Binding Lectin"}, {"text": "A large number of studies have attempted to define the role of MBL in predisposing to severe infection [9] .

The precise mechanisms underlying this result remain unclear; the Nco1 polymorphism may not be directly related to TNF production, but rather serve as a major histocompatibility complex (MHC) marker because of its location in the class III region of the MHC.
