            "text": "Mycoplasma pneumoniae (M. pneumoniae) is a common bacterial cause of upper and lower respiratory tract infections in children and adolescents. Recent advances in antimicrobial agents, including macrolide antibiotics [1], tetracyclines and fluoroquinolones, have enabled its treatment on an outpatient basis for most children with community-acquired pneumonia. Since the time when macrolide resistant (MR) M. pneumoniae was first isolated from a pediatric patient in 2000 [2], the drug resistance trend has been documented all over the world [3-10], especially in children. Extremely high rates of macrolide resistance have been reported mainly in Asian countries [3,4]. According to the continuous surveillance in Japan, the frequency of MR-M. pneumoniae cases has increased year by year, and nowadays >80% of M. pneumoniae isolates were shown to be macrolide resistant [4]. However, most of these reports included the data in secondary or tertiary care facilities; thus very little information is currently available on the prevalence of MR-M. pneumoniae infection, especially in outpatient settings. Macrolide-resistant genotypes can be defined by the detection of specific point mutations in the domain V of the single-operon derived 23S rRNA gene of M. pneumoniae. While most frequent mutations that induce high levels of macrolide-resistance included an A-to-G transition at position 2063 or 2064 [11,12], recent epidemiologic studies have suggested that distribution of MR-M. pneumoniae genotypes has been changing [4,13]. The primary objective of our study was to clarify the present status of MR-M. pneumoniae. For the present, it is difficult to make an early identification of which children being infected by MR-M. pneumoniae. Thus, secondly, we evaluated children with M. pneumoniae infections with regard to clinical symptoms, efficacy of several antimicrobial agents and several laboratory data to investigate the predictive factors of MR-M. pneumoniae infections.",

Nasopharyngeal swab specimens and blood samples were obtained from all patients at the time of enrollment, and the throat swabs were sent to the Laboratory of Virology, Fukuoka Institute of Health and Environmental Sciences. Laboratory-confirmed M. pneumoniae infection was defined as detection of M. pneumoniae DNA from the throat swab by PCR methods. Multiplex PCR was carried out as described previously [14,15]. M. pneumoniae, rhinoviruses (RV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), coronaviruses, human metapneumovirus (HMPV), human bocavirus, influenza A, and B viruses, adenovirus and parainfluenza virus (PIV 1\u20134). Ultimately, data on 65 children (33 girls, 32 boys; mean age 6.1 years) with positive for M. pneumoniae were analyzed.

Specifically, patients with the A2063G transition (90.3%) were more likely to have had the initially prescribed macrolide changed to another antimicrobial agent other than a macrolide in comparison not only to macrolide-sensitive patients (28.6%, p = 0.001) but also to those with A2063T transversion (63.0%, p = 0.02). Fever disappeared dramatically within 48 hr after changing to other drugs such as MIN or TFX in all patients whose clinical findings had failed to improve or whose chest radiographic findings had worsened during the initial treatment. In two patients, symptoms resolved spontaneously without any antibiotics (one with no mutation and the other with A2063T). With regard to the timing of sample collection, 44 of the 65 patients with M. pneumoniae had already been treated with antimicrobial agents before nasopharyngeal specimens were collected. There were no statistically significant differences in the incidence of macrolide resistance as to whether sample was collected before or after antimicrobial agents administration (in 17 of 21 (81.0%) collected before administration, and in 41 of 44 (93.2%) collected after administration, p = 0.25).",

The incidence of MR-M. pneumoniae in this general pediatric outpatient setting was nearly as high as those described in continuous surveillance in Japan [4]. Thirty-one of the 58 MR-M. pneumoniae strains (53.5%) harbored an A-to-G transition mutation at position 2063 in the 23S rRNA genes, which was consistent with previously reported findings [18] that the A2063G transition was the most frequent mutation. A striking finding in our present work is that the remaining 27 samples (46.5%) showed an A-to-T transversion at position 2063 in the 23S rRNA genes. The A2063T mutation was first reported in China during 2008\u20132009 [3,19] but has been rarely reported thereafter. However, recent reports from Japan have revealed that the A2063T transversion have been increasing [4,13]. A community outbreak of A2063T transversion was reported recently in Yamagata, Japan, in 2009 [13]. In this point, the resistant strains in our study were polyclonal in origin, which is consistent with the previous report [20]. Although the precise mechanisms of outbreak of the A2063T transversion mutation are not yet known, in general, transversion mutations that change the chemical structure dramatically are thought to affect bacterial growth more severely and in consequence to be less common than transition mutations. For example, an in-vitro study revealed that the mutation rate of A-to-T transversion is less than one-tenth that of A-to-G transition in E. coli cells, coinciding with the spontaneous misinsertion rate of its DNA polymerase III [21].",

It is true that gene amplification methods such as real-time PCR [7] and pyrosequencing [22] must be a best way to detect resistance, however, these methods are confined to very few specialized laboratories in Japan. For reason of that, we expect some additional information on pathogenesis of mycoplasmal infection through measurement of cytokines and chemokines. Higher levels in serum were found for some inflammatory cytokines such as IFN- gamma, IP-10 and IL-6 in patients infected by the macrolide-resistant strains than in those infected by the strains with no-mutation, while no difference was observed in the levels of IL-8 and IL-18 between the two groups. It has been thought IL18 and IL-8 play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of M. pneumonia infection according to the disease severity [23,24]. There are several explanations for this discrepancy. First, disease severity was not so high in our patients infected with macrolide-resistant strains. Indeed we did not experience apparent treatment failure or serious illness. These findings were consistent with previous reports which showed that drug resistance in M. pneumoniae does not always lead to severe clinical manifestations [25,26]. Second, the timing of blood sampling might alter the levels of these cytokines as reported by Narita et al. [27], since we only performed blood sampling at the time of enrollment. On the other hand, the higher levels of IFN- gamma, IP-10 and IL-6 in the patients with MR-M. pneumoniae infection might reflect, as a non-specific inflammatory marker, the prolonged low degree of inflammation which is represented by slightly longer duration of fever due to the drug resistance. Our results imply the possibility that in addition to the lower clinical efficacy of macrolide treatment, measurement of levels of certain inflammatory cytokines may be a strong candidate that allows the clinicians to suspect MR-M. pneumoniae infection.",

As shown by the susceptibility testing, all four strains with the A2063T mutation showed lower MICs for AZM (0.25 \u03bcg/mL), and actually, the eight patients with A2063T mutation who were treated with AZM showed complete resolution of clinical symptoms. Thus our data showed that the in-vitro susceptibility directly predicts the clinical efficacy as previously reported [25,26,28]. The reason why AZM is effective in patients with an A2063T transversion is unclear. One plausible explanation is a difference in chemical structures. That is, while the binding of 14-membered-ring macrolides to A2063 is affected both by the G transition and by the T transversion, the binding of 15-membered-ring macrolides to A2063 is not affected by T transversion. Nevertheless, since the A2063T transversion mutation must be related to more profound damage to growth efficiency, the reason remains unknown why so many strains with the rarely reported A2063T mutation, a total of 27, were isolated in this study (in the Fukuoka area). Interestingly, the A2063T mutation slightly but significantly raises the MICs for RKI (4 \u03bcg/mL), in contrast to the fact that the strains with the A2063G mutation can be considered susceptible to this macrolide (1 \u03bcg/mL). This suggests that A2063G transposition does not affect the binding of RKI to the domain V while A2063T transversion affects the binding to some degree.",
