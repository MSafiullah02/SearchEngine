As the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection has become pandemic, the scientific community is in a race against time to beat the COVID\u201019 by unraveling molecular targets and discover epitopes in the protein sequences of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 for vaccines/antibodies synthesis. It has been reported that in addition to the conventional respiratory complains of flu, patients are also exhibiting neurological signs and symptoms. Recently, the report of a patient with COVID\u201019 exhibiting loss of the involuntary process of breathing\n1\n controlled by the inspiratory area in the brainstem, is alarming. Additionally, neurological deficits reported in uncomplicated and complicated patients with COVID\u201019\n2\n from hospitals in Wuhan, China, are convincing enough that the neurological deficits could be ongoing in the recent outbreak without getting noticed. As the recent outbreak has now spread to almost all of the continents and has become pandemic, we are in the early phases of our attempts to understand the syndromic complexity of the COVID\u201019. The SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 causing COVID\u201019 can take two pathways to involve the brain (Figure 1). Early occurrences of loss of smell, ataxia, and convulsions should be further evaluated for CNS involvement by SARS\u2010CoV\u20102.",

The prognostic and diagnostic significance of neurological sign and symptoms in COVID\u201019 patients can be gauged by fact that the protocol designed to investigate the First Few X cases (FFX) and their close contacts by the World Health Organization (WHO), includes a separate section for \u201cother neurological signs\u201d in addition to separate columns for respiratory symptoms.\n3\n Additionally, reports of COVID\u201019\u2010affected individuals experiencing convulsions in prevalent areas is alarming and need to be distinguished from febrile convolution that is expected to occur with high\u2010grade fever in patients with COVID\u201019.",

            "text": "Our experience with taxonomically related SARS\u2010CoV patients in the past has proven beyond doubt the coronaviruses to affect the brain. Of many examples from the past, was a case where SARS\u2010CoV was isolated from the brain of a patient who had exhibited features of neurological deficits on 28th day of infection.\n4\n In past outbreaks with SARS\u2010CoV, it has been shown that it targets the CNS\n5\n and the reports that the brain also is an additional target of SARS\u2010CoV\n4\n raises the possibility of the presentation of more patients with neurological manifestations in the ongoing outbreak of COIVD\u201019. Also, SARS\u2010CoV has been isolated from brain tissue with edema and neuronal degeneration as seen at autopsies with immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization, and electron microscopic confirmation of viral infection of the neurons.\n6\n It would not be surprising to see the COVID\u201019 virus following the same trend as both viruses are near identical taxonomically. As the pandemic is in effect at present, a detailed timeline of the syndromic neurological manifestation in COVID\u201019 will emerge as more studies get published on complicated and uncomplicated cases of COVID\u201019. Though the understanding of the pathogenetic mechanisms underlying the CNS invasion will be revealed in time, there is an urgent need to distinguish between neurologically affected CVOID\u201019 patients and those who do not exhibit the sign and symptoms of CNS involvement. The hematogenous route appears to be the likely pathway for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 to reach the brain, but other routes to the CNS like across the cribriform plate (Figure 1B) of the ethmoid bone in proximity to the olfactory bulb\n7\n should be taken into consideration in cases of early\u2010phase COVID\u201019\u2010affected patients who exhibit loss of smell and taste accompanied with neurological signs and symptoms. Studies believe that direct SARS\u2010CoV infection of the human CNS does occur in some patients.\n8\n It is also important to mention here that the neurological signs and symptoms observed in the COVID\u201019 cases could be a manifestation of hypoxia, respiratory, and metabolic acidosis at an advanced stage of the disease, but reasonably, a differential diagnosis of these cases is needed, which could prove lifesaving. The later distinction also appears to be important from the vantage point of selecting a treatment regimen, as management of the COVID\u201019 cases with neurological involvement would require more specific and aggressive treatments as compared to the patients without it.",

Presence of neurological deficits followed by laboratory tests like serum urea, creatinine, electrolytes, and blood gases (PO2\u2010PCO2) can be helpful in the determination of primary or secondary involvement of the CNS in COVID\u201019\u2010affected patients. With our experience and lessons learned from the past SARS\u2010CoV\n4\n, \n5\n, \n6\n infections, specific investigation like attempts to isolate SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 from CSF, as has been reported recently\n9\n, could prove to be of enormous advantage to diagnose an early or potentially complicated cases of COVID\u201019. As neuronal death in CoV infections is not accompanied by substantial inflammation,\n8\n clinical signs and symptoms of meningoencephalitis cannot be relied upon. As we are in a learning phase of what COVID\u201019 presents with and how the patients are different from SARS\u2010CoV\u2010affected cases reported in the past, it is difficult if not impossible, to predict any particular diagnostic neurological test to ascertain the high\u2010risk COVID\u201019 patients with covert infections of the CNS. As neurological deficits do occur in terminally ill patients with COVID\u201019 (Figure 1D), an early differential diagnosis can be lifesaving in COVID\u201019 patients. A biomarker in CSF or serum of the COVID\u201019 patients with neurological deficits would have been of ideal to diagnose cases of COVID\u201019 with CNS involvement, but with the unavailability of such methods, as of yet, smearing every possible method to include or exclude the COVID\u201019 cases with neurological damage needs to be implemented.",

With the vascular endothelium well known to express the ACE2 receptors (the target receptor of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102), it would be interesting to see whether SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 can be isolated from CNS at autopsy from the endothelial linings within the zones adjacent to the necrotic areas in COVID\u201019 patients, as has been reported recently.\n10\n The later study, and recent reports of detection of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 in the CSF of the COVID\u201019 patient\n9\n without a reasonable doubt validate our rationale of CNS being targeted by SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 as pointed out recently\n7\n.
