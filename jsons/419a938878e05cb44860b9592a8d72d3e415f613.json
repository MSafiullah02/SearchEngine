This study aimed to analyze the changing patterns and the tempo-geographic features of the COVID-19 epidemic, to provide further evidence for real-time responses. Methods: Daily data on COVID-2019 cases between 31 st Dec. 2019 and 26 th Feb. 2020 were collected and analyzed for Hubei and non-Hubei regions. Observed trends for new and cumulative cases were analyzed through joint-point regressions. Spatial analysis was applied to show the geographic distribution and changing pattern of the epidemic.",

[1] [2] [3] [4] The situation is further compounded by the high number of presumed hospital-acquired infection, and the potential for secondary transmission through asymptomatic contacts. [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] In response to this epidemic, China issued rapid and comprehensive public health emergency interventions at the national level; upgraded quarantine and isolation guidelines; and expanded its Level One Public Health Emergency Response to 31 provinces within mainland China. All provinces issued the highest level of emergency public health alerts and responses within the national public health management system and cities with high numbers of reported cases went under lockdown with restricted access in most of their communities as part of preventive measures. Due to the high probability of the virus causing a global pandemic, the World Health Organization (WHO) on 30 th Jan. 2020 declared the COVID-19 outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). 7 Nonetheless, the Chinese government continued to act and implement containment and preventive measures in the global public best interest by reporting the epidemic and improving transparency in data reporting rights from the onset. The ever-increasing flow of A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t 5 information freely available and easily accessible online has allowed the public to understand the emerging epidemic status and the need for compliance. The data has also provided a great opportunity for researchers and public authorities to better understand the epidemic trends, predict the disease patterns, and provide technical support through data analysis. Moreover, the data also provided a better understanding of how SARS-CoV-2 spread temporally and geographically.",

Suspected In the hot spot analysis, the conceptualization of spatial relationship was set to inverse distance with the hypothesis that area with smaller distance has higher impact on the calculated field. Z-score, p value, and Gi_Bin were calculated in the hot spot analysis. High z-score with p value <0.01, 0.05, and 0.1 indicated a hotspot.

However, a sudden peak in the trend was observed with 14,840 cases on 12 th Feb. 2020 , as the disease diagnosis criteria were changed (from laboratory-based confirmation to clinical diagnosis, Graph A) for Hubei province.

However, Qianjiang,Tianmen and Xiantao, which are also near Wuhan, were not affected as severely as the other neighboring cities. The number of new cases in all the cities were less than 42 from 20 Feb., except for Wuhan; furthermore, over four cities reported zero new case every day since 22 Feb. 2020. Joint-point analysis identified the changing points for cumulative cases in the non-Hubei region to be 26 th Jan., 7 th Feb. 14 th Feb. and this data in addition to 26 th Feb. was used to develop a distribution map to showcase the development of the disease outbreak. Few areas near Hubei and in east China reported COVID-2019 cases in stage A (26 th Jan. 2020, Figure 2 , Graph A) and later evolved into stage B by spreading to most of east China. The disease then spread throughout the country but with less than 20 cases in many cities except for partial north-west China which was unaffected. More cases were found in areas near Hubei, especially Chongqing, where 426 people were infected. Some distant cities from Hubei, such as Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Wenzhou, Shanghai, and Beijing, were also highly affected with over 160 cases (Figure 2, A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t 11 Graph B). The color of the areas near Hubei and highly affected cities gradually and slightly deepened when the outbreak evolved into stage C (Feb. 14) and Stage D (Feb. 26) but all unaffected areas except Yichun in Heilongjiang province remained safe (Figure 3 , Graph C and D).

For example, whiles the turning point may have been reached by February 3 rd for non-Hubei regions, Hubei province reached this much later and yet recorded another peak on February 12 th . 15 Reasons that may have led to this situation include the fact that Hubei province being the center of the outbreak with over 80% of reported confirmed cases faced the worst impact of the epidemic and recorded higher mortality rates than other regions. 16 Secondary transmission in the region was also hard to control as more time and effort was required to curb the epidemic. Furthermore, prevention reaction to the outbreak was slow at onset as public health authorizes in Hubei province underestimated the potential of the virus and did not fully react even after hundreds of cases had been identified. Due to this slow reaction time, the opportunity for timely prevention of secondary transmission was missed, which in turn led to the global epidemic. The slow reaction time also seriously handicapped the health system of Hubei provinces as over 1700 health care workers got infected, thereby reducing available medical resources for the epidemic control in the region. Other provinces however learnt from Hubei's gaps and reacted early by issuing level one public health emergency responses. This drastic measure at enabled those regions to reach an early turning point during the epidemic before the SARS-CoV-2 could spread further within their regions.",

The increase further slowed after 19 th Feb. 2020 (slope = 402). Trends for the cumulative cases out of Hubei Province in China behaved similarly in growth (trend slope increased from 200 in stage one to 729 in stage two) to that of Hubei Province in the first two stages(Figure 1, Graph D). It however changed at the third stage as the increasing trend of cumulative cases started to decelerate after 7 th Feb. 2020 (slope=363), which was about one week before the time when the trend in Hubei started to slowed down; and the increase of cumulative cases was gentle after 14 th Feb. 2020 (slope=67).",

Our findings indicate that a turning point of the epidemic have been reached in both Hubei and Non-Hubei regions in China as evidenced by the overall decreasing trend of newly confirmed cases both in and outside of Hubei Province. In Hubei provinces, there was a sudden increase of the number of newly identified cases, which delayed the reaching of a turning-point. However, the sudden increase in the number of confirmed cases was mainly due to a change in the diagnosis criteria of COVID-19 for the province (changed from lab-confirmed cases only to clinically diagnosed since 12 th Feb. 2020) 15 to facilitate early treatment and care for suspected cases and prevent secondary transmission. Without the the observed sudden spike in 12 th Feb. 2020, the turning point may have reached on February 8 th . Nevertheless, all of these indicating that the epidemic in China has turning better since February 14 th . However, reaching a turning point for an epidemic does not necessarily signify the end of the epidemic as secondary transmission of SARS-CoV-2 continues in China and worldwide. Thus, the need for improved efforts to reduce the timeline from case identification to confirmation still remains urgent. Also, efforts to strengthen quarantine and isolation procedures in areas with serious epidemics are continually required. However, differentiated prevention efforts should be implemented depending on a regions' epidemic level. Such as areas with relatively low or no SARS-CoV-2 infected cases should implement strategies aimed at reducing the impact of the epidemic on the economy and encouraging people to resume normal daily life",
