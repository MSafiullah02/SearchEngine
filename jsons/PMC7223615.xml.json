A clinical trial investigating favipiravir against the Ebola virus showed that it could reduce mortality from 30 to 15% [10]. Favipiravir can be used safely in humans and has been approved to treat influenza in Japan. It does not inhibit mammalian RNA or DNA synthesis and is not toxic to mammalian cells [6]. Reports have indicated that favipiravir has a better safety profile compared with ribavirin [11].",
