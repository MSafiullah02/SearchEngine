Because histopathological and immunohistochemical analyses of paraffin-embedded tissues play an important role in recognizing infectious agents in tissue samples, six in-house polyclonal antibodies raised against three representative enteroviruses using an indirect immunofluorescence assay and immunohistochemistry were examined. This panel of polyclonal antibodies recognized three serotypes of enterovirus. Two of the polyclonal antibodies were raised against denatured virus particles from enterovirus A71, one was raised against the recombinant VP1 protein of coxsackievirus B3, and the other for poliovirus type 1 were raised against denatured virus particles, the recombinant VP1 protein and peptide 2C. Western blot analysis revealed that each of these antibodies recognized the corresponding viral antigen and none cross-reacted with non-enteroviruses within the family Picornaviridae. However, all cross-reacted to some extent with the antigens derived from other serotypes of enterovirus. Indirect immunofluorescence assay and immunohistochemistry revealed that the virus capsid and non-structural proteins were localized in the cytoplasm of affected culture cells, and skeletal muscles and neurons in neonatal mice experimentallyinfected with human enterovirus. The antibodies also recognized antigens derived from recent clinical isolates of enterovirus A71, coxsackievirus B3 and poliovirus. In addition, immunohistochemistry revealed that representative antibodies tested showed the same recognition pattern according to each serotype. Thus, the panel of in-house anti-enterovirus polyclonal antibodies described herein will be an important tool for the screening and pathological diagnosis for enterovirus infections, and may be useful for the classification of different enterovirus serotypes, including coxsackieviruses A and B, echoviruses, enterovirus A71 and poliovirus.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Enterovirus (EV), one of the genuses of the family Picornaviridae, including coxsackievirus A and B (CVA and CVB), echovirus (Echo), enterovirus A71 (EV71), and poliovirus (PV) cause a wide spectrum of human disease, such as hand-foot-and-mouth disease (HFMD), herpangina, pneumonia, diabetes mellitus and aseptic meningitis.

The viral capsid comprises four proteins: VP1, VP2, VP3 and VP4. The epitopes on VP1, VP2 and VP3 are recognized by neutralizing antibodies. [11] [12] [13] In particular, VP1 bears the greatest number of neutralizing epitopes. [14] [15] [16] Serologically, EV is categorized into 66 or more serotypes on the basis of neutralization tests using prototype viruses. Neutralizing antibodies have also been used to identify EV in neonatal mice and tissue cultures. The ninth report by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses in 2013 reclassified the genus Enterovirus into 12 species (EV-A, -B, -C, -D, -E, -F, -G, -H, -J and Rhinovirus A, B, C) according to their biological and genetic properties. 17 Detection of pathogens is necessary for accurate pathological diagnoses and to identify the relationship between a pathogen and an illness. 18 Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and in situ hybridization (ISH) are used to detect viral antigens and its genomes on tissue sections, respectively. 1, [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] Nowadays, reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and quantitative real time PCR are also used to detect viral genomes using nucleic acids extracted from fresh tissues and/or paraffinembedded tissue sections. [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] However, RNA and DNA genomes are easily modified during formalin fixation. 29 After more than 3 weeks of formalin fixation, the sensitivity for detecting viral RNA in paraffin-embedded tissues falls by approximately 100 times compared with that in fresh tissues. 30 Thus, detecting viral antigens by IHC is most useful for screening and diagnostic procedures. Paraffinembedded tissue sections from virus-infected neonatal mice or cultured cells can be used as positive controls when detecting viral antigens or genomes by IHC or ISH. 24, 31, 32 Some researchers used cultured cells as positive controls for IHC and ISH, 21, 24, 28, 31 whereas others used tissues from virus-infected neonatal mice as positive controls. 20, 22 We previously developed, three in-house anti-EV polyclonal antibodies, which were raised denatured virus particles derived from EV71 and PV, for diagnosis and pathological research into disease pathogenesis in experimental animals. 23, [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] Here, we generated another three anti-EV polyclonal antibodies specific for the CVB3 VP1 protein, PV VP1 protein and the PV1 2C non-structural protein. All six anti-EV polyclonal antibodies were examined in terms of their specificity for, and cross-reactivity with, different enterovirus serotypes, species and genera.

The cells and prototype viruses were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC; Manassas, VA, USA).

Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays using sera from EV-infected patients revealed that the most reactive peptides were derived from conserved regions at the amino-terminus of VP1. 50 VP1 mediates viral attachment to target cells and bears several neutralizing epitopes; however, it also shares epitopes with other EV.

We also examined anti-GST-CVB3-VP1 and anti-GST-PV1-VP1 fusion protein antibodies, which recognize the capsid protein of VP1.

Cross-reactivity with the mitochondrial enzymes was prevented by blocking specimens with a solution containing excess ATP5B and CKBB. 52 Another commercial anti-EV monoclonal antibody is also available, although it cross-reacts with rhinovirus, coronavirus, herpes virus and reovirus. 53 Animal tissue samples obtained after experimental infection are more similar to human specimens than cultured cells and are thus useful for evaluating non-specific binding. Here, we used paraffinembedded tissue samples from neonatal mice infected with prototype virus or EV isolates (this was not possible for Echo because the virus does not infect mice). A common problem associated with polyclonal antibodies for IHC in tissue samples (both human and animal) is the high level of background staining due to non-specific binding or specific cross-reactions. 54 To solve this, we used powdered-acetone tissue or cultured cell preparations to block non-specific binding; we also purified the IgG fraction in an attempt to reduce non-specific binding. 54 These treatments mostly worked well, although higher antibody concentrations were needed in the assays (data not shown). Treatment with acetone powder was successful in reducing the nonspecific binding of the anti-EV71 and PV antibodies when examining specimens from animals with EV71 and PV encephalitis after experimental infection. 34, 35 We also examined the cross-reactivity of the six polyclonal antibodies with other picornaviruses, including HPeV and SAFV.
