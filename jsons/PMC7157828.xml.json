A year later (2007), and as prelude to the work of Globalization Knowledge Network of the World Health Organization\u2019s Commission on Social Determinants of Health, globalization was defined as a \u2018determinant of social determinants\u2019 trickling down in ways sometimes healthy, but predominantly health-risky [3].",

The differential impacts on health of specific food items, in this case palm oil consumption, suggested that globalization\u2019s health impacts were not equitably allocated (2011) [6]. Some of globalization\u2019s unequal outcomes were manifest in health systems themselves: from radiology services (2010) [7], to biases that privilege research from rich countries over poorer ones (2017) [8], to this year\u2019s so-far trending lead article on global surgery (2020) [9].",

Another collection focuses on health system innovations in low- and middle-income countries, belying the notion that such countries lack innovative ideas from which the world at large can learn [18]. The enduring topic of global health partnerships has its own dedicated place in the journal [19], while we recently hosted a special call for papers on intersectoral actions for health in the SDG that generated a range of new contributions [20]. There is also a new open collection, timely given the COVID-19 crisis, examining governance and preparedness for infectious disease threats [21]. The journal also published our first supplement in 2019 on the political determinants of health inequities and universal health coverage [22]. Many of these specially edited collections were published in collaboration with partnering universities and institutions.",

A surge in single country health studies a few years ago had the editorial team reformulate more precisely the journal\u2019s scope to ensure its focus on the importance of how globalization processes affected health outcomes, whether in a given country, cross-nationally interrogated, or examined at a global scale [23]. The accompanying re-design in our sections and editorial processes, and a revitalization of our Editorial Board, has made the scholarship we publish more germane to globalization and health researchers and, we hope, more useful to global health policy-makers and advocates.",

Although globalization (the increasing interdependence of peoples across time and space) is unlikely to cease, the economic rules that have largely defined and been driving it for the past 40 years are under ever-more critical questioning. The global supply chains that bound together our economies are under threat, nativist sentiments are fraying international cooperation, the (still under-regulated) world of financial speculation is once more haemorrhaging, and it is again the poor and the vulnerable who will bear the heaviest health burden.",
