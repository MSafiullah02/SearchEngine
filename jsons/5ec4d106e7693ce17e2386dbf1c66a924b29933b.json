Recall that Prieur proved that one can decide whether a given \u03c9-rational function is continuous [16, 17] . On the other hand, Carton, Finkel and Simonnet proved that one cannot decide whether a given \u03c9-rational function f has at least one point of continuity [3] . Notice that this decision problem is actually \u03a3 1 1 -complete, hence highly undecidable [6] . It was also proved in [3] that one cannot decide whether the continuity set of a given \u03c9-rational function f (its set of continuity points) is a regular (respectively, context-free) \u03c9-language. Notice that the situation was shown to be quite different in the case of synchronous functions. It was proved in [3] that if f : A \u03c9 \u2192 B \u03c9 is an \u03c9-rational synchronous function, then the continuity set C(f ) of f is \u03c9-rational. Moreover, if X is an \u03c9-rational \u03a0 0 2 subset of A \u03c9 , then X is the continuity set C(f ) of some rational synchronous function f of domain A \u03c9 . Notice that these previous works on the continuity of \u03c9-rational functions had shown that decision problems in this area may be decidable or not, while it is well known that most problems about regular languages accepted by finite automata are decidable.",

For instance an \u03c9-automatic structure is defined via synchronous infinitary rational relations, see [2, 12] . On the other hand, any (synchronous) infinitary rational relation is uniformizable by a (synchronous) \u03c9-rational function, see [4] . Thus we can expect that our result will be useful in particular in the study of \u03c9-automatic structures.",

If L = L(A) is a closed set then L \\ Int(L) is a closed set with empty interior. Moreover it is known that one can construct from the B\u00fcchi automaton A another B\u00fcchi automaton B accepting Int(L), and then also a B\u00fcchi automaton C accepting L \\ Int(L).
