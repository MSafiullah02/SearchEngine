We address the question concerning the choice of optimal mechanism for most effective prohibiting disease propagation in a connected network: adaptive clustering, which mimics self-isolation (SI) in local communities, or sharp instant clustering, which looks like frontiers closing (FC) between cities and countries. SI-networks are \"adaptively grown\" under condition of maximization of small cliques in the entire network, while FC-networks are \"instantly created\". Running the standard SIR model on clustered SI-and FCnetworks, we demonstrate that the adaptive network clustering prohibits the epidemic spreading better than the instant clustering in the network with similar parameters. We found that SI model has scale-free property for degree distribution P (k) \u223c k \u03b7 with small critical exponent \u22122 < \u03b7 < \u22121 and argue that scale-free behavior emerges due to the randomness in the initial degree distributions and is absent for random regular graphs.",

In e-networks, which are non-ergodic, excitations are mostly localized on clusters and weakly spread through the entire network, since the network is connected and there is a small, though finite density of inter-cluster links. Ergodic i-networks, which serve as a particular example of a \"stochastic block model\" [10, 11] , being geometrically very similar to e-networks, are less effective in blocking the excitation spreading. As we show below, the dis-tinction between e-and i-networks deals with different statistics of inter-cluster links in these networks. In our work we report results of simulations of the standard SIR model on clustered e-and i-networks. The SIR model (described in Section IV) is the simplest and widely used model of disease transmission from human to human.",

The N -vertex Erd\u0151s-R\u00e9nyi network is a topological graph of N vertices constructed by random linking with probability p any pair of points from a set of N arbitrary points. The probability, P (k), to find a vertex in ER network, linked with other k vertices, is Poissonian with the mean value k = N p. Another well-studied class of random networks are the so-called scale-free networks, for which the vertex degree distribution, P (k) \u223c k \u03b7 , has a powerlaw tail with a critical exponent \u03b7 < 0 (typically \u03b7 < \u22122). The overwhelming majority of natural networks is scale-arXiv:2003.12290v2 [physics.soc-ph] 7 Apr 2020 free, and the network of distribution of COVID-19 is not an exception [12] . Natural networks, being complex self-organized objects, evolve in time trying to adapt themselves to imposed external conditions. We distinguish two classes of dynamic Erd\u0151s-R\u00e9nyi networks: \"unconstrained\" (without the vertex degree conservation during the network evolution) and \"constrained\" (with preservation of vertex degrees in all nodes under network rewiring). In unconstrained ER networks one can remove any link from one place of the network and insert it into any other place. To the contrary, in constrained ER networks the realization of a rewiring is more complex and involves simultaneous replacement at least two bonds.",

It seems reasonable to assume that for each individual, the number of social connections (the particular vertex degree in a social network) is conserved. The number of connections may vary from one individual to another, however for each human it is supposed to be fixed and unchanged during the social network evolution. Such a supposition seems rather natural since the number of relations per one individual rapidly increases, saturates and then remains approximately conserved in time. Specifically, we proceed with the following rewiring setup which conserves vertex degrees. We take a random Erd\u0151s-R\u00e9nyi N -vertex graph without double connections as an initial state of a network. Then, we randomly select a pair of arbitrary links, say, (ij) (between vertices i and j) and (k, l) (between k and l), and reconnect them, getting new links (i, k) and (j, l). Such reconnections conserve the vertex degree [13] , however allow for bonds redistribution and do not prohibit topological changes in the entire network. In the context of phase transitions in social networks such dynamic model has been discussed in [14] .",

The \"i-network\" is instantly formed being a particular example of a stochastic block random graph [10, 11] . The i-network is constructed by the following procedure. Firstly, we detect clusters {J} in the e-network, define the link probability, p J in , inside each cluster J, and between clusters, p out . Secondly, we split the set of N points in groups as in the e-network, and generate new random clusters by connecting vertices in these groups with the probability p J in . In such a way we \"mimic\" clusters of e-networks. Finally, we randomly connect nodes belonging to different clusters with the probability p out borrowed from the average connection probability between clusters in e-network. Such an \"instantly created\" i-network mimics the e-network, since i-network has the same linking probability and community structure as the evolutionary grown e-network -see Fig.2 . However the i-network has no any pre-history, it knows nothing about the evolution, it has no dependence on \u00b5, and has no vertex degree conservation. Visual inspection of Fig.2 does not allow us to distinguish adjacency matrices e-and i-networks. Besides, propagation of excitation on e-and i-networks behaves very differently. To summarize, we have in hands ensembles of two kinds of networks: (i) evolutionary grown (e-networks) which have memory about the history of its creation, and (ii) instantly ad hoc formed (i-networks). Comparing mechanisms of construction of e-and i-networks, it seems plausible:",

Rather nontrivial rewiring procedure for generating networks with \u03b7 > \u22122 has been proposed in [17] . Despite the algorithm of [17] looks rather sophisticated, the ideas behind its construction are in good agreement with our simple generation procedure of the scale-free network with \u22122 < \u03b7 < \u22121. Namely, to get \u03b7 > \u22122 one should accurately tune the combination of local and global constraints. One more rewiring procedure was suggested in [18] for getting \u03b7 = \u22121. Fortunately, our simple algorithm dealing with maximization of triads in constrained Erd\u0151s-R\u00e9nyi network brings the system automatically in the regime where generation of a scale-free subnetwork with \u22122 < \u03b7 < \u22121 occurs.

Currently two main mechanisms of a human population clustering are exploited by different countries in order to prevent the uncontrolled spreading of COVID-19. Tentatively these mechanisms could be named a \"self-isolation\" (SI) and a \"frontiers closing\" (FC). In both cases the aim of clustering is to localize the illness in closed community and prevent it from the propagation through the entire human network. Specifically, we are interested in the question which mechanism blocks better an epidemic spreading: self-quarantine in local communities induced by adaptive clustering, or sharp clustering via closing of borders between cities and countries? In an ideal situation, when all self-isolated communities are absolutely disconnected from each other, and when the border crossings between cities and countries is totally prohibited, both protocols are equally efficient and definitely inhibit disease expansion. However, in reality, it is impossible to isolate communities completely and some fraction of cross-community connections always is present.

We have also proposed new mechanism of derivation of scale-free behavior via peculiar rewiring process. Epidemic spreading on scale-free network has some specific peculiarities [22] . In particular, the epidemic threshold almost vanishes which means that scale-free network is bad for epidemic suppression at the beginning of its distribution. However once started, it can be operated on scale-free network more effectively than on other types of networks. The new rewiring mechanism for getting scale-free behavior can be useful for these purposes.",
