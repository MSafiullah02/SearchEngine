Combining the ethyl substituent at position 5 of the heterocyclic base in MADTP-372 and the 3\u2032-acetyl group at the aryl moiety present in the initial hit (MADTP-314) led to the synthesis of MADTP-393 (the synthesis of this molecule will be published elsewhere). This MADTP analog had a better anti-CHIKV profile than MADTP-314, but was not as potent as MADTP-372 (Table 1). MADTP-346 is a close structural analog that was devoid of anti-CHIKV activity.",

Time-of-addition studies revealed that MADTP-314 had an inhibition profile that was comparable to that of a polymerase-targeting compound (T-70512), i.e. the compound remained active when addition to the infected cultures was delayed by several hours (up to 6 h) post infection (1.3 log10 and 1.0 log10 reduction in CHIKV RNA for MADTP-314 and T-705, respectively, when added 6h post infection and assessed at 24 h post infection). In contrast, chloroquine, a CHIKV entry inhibitor included as a reference compound, entirely lost its protective activity when added at time points later than 1 h p.i., whereas a 2 log10 reduction of CHIKV RNA was obtained when the compound was added 2 h before infection. To study whether MADTP-314 can block CHIKV cell entry, CHIKV pseudoparticles (CHIKVpp) were produced as described before15. These pseudoparticles are lentiviral vectors carrying CHIKV glycoproteins and are thus ideally suited to study CHIKV entry independently from post entry steps in the viral life cycle. In line with the time-of-addition experiments, MADTP-314 and analogs were not able to block the entry of CHIKV pseudoparticles (CHIKVpp) into the host cell (Fig. 2a). In contrast, CHIKV entry inhibitors such as arbidol and chloroquine inhibited CHIKVpp entry in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2a)916. To assess whether MADTP-314 (directly) affects translation of incoming capped CHIKV RNA genomes, cells were transfected with a replication-deficient CHIKV RNA (carrying an active site mutation in the RNA polymerase domain of nsP4) encoding an nsP3-luciferase fusion protein, which allowed measuring translation independent of RNA replication. Luciferase activity in cells treated with 250 \u03bcM MADTP-314 was comparable to that in untreated control cells, suggesting that the compound did not directly inhibit translation of the incoming, capped genomic RNA (Fig. 2b). Next we assessed whether MADTP-314 had a direct inhibitory effect on CHIKV RNA synthesis as quantified by measuring 3H-uridine incorporation into newly synthesized CHIKV RNA. In CHIKV-infected cells, MADTP-314 (50\u2013250 \u03bcM) did not inhibit CHIKV RNA synthesis (Fig. 2c). This was confirmed in an in vitro assay with isolated replication/transcription complexes (RTCs)17, which demonstrated that 250 \u03bcM of MADTP-314 did not inhibit the incorporation of 32P-CTP into CHIKV RNA (Fig. 2d). Taken together these results demonstrate that MADTP-314 inhibits CHIKV replication at a post-entry step, other than translation or viral RNA synthesis.",

In contrast to the WT virus, the reverse-engineered mutant nsP1-P34S virus proved to be highly resistant to the antiviral effect of the three different MADTP compounds [it should be noted that CHIKV strain LS3 was 1.5-fold less sensitive to MADTP-314 than CHIKV 899]. By analyzing CHIKV protein expression in infected cells, the nsP1-P43S mutant virus was also shown to be highly resistant to MADTP-314, as nsP1 and E2E3 proteins were easily detected in cells treated with MADTP-314 concentrations above 63 \u03bcM, whereas such treatment resulted in hardly detectable expression of CHIKV proteins in cells infected with the WT virus (Fig. 4).

Through a non-conventional cytoplasmic capping mechanism, alphaviruses synthesize the minimal RNA cap chemical structure, named cap-0 (m7GpppNp-RNA, in which N is the first nucleotide of the viral RNA, p represents a phosphate and m represents a methyl group)20. Several reactions are required for the synthesis of the alphavirus cap structure.

Inhibitors of viral capping that were previously reported target the MTases of flaviviruses and coronaviruses26.

For alphaviruses, the capping mechanism driven by the multifunctional nsP1 protein could be an attractive target for antiviral treatment since it differs from its cellular counterpart.

More precisely, nsP1 H37, the amino acid that is the putative acceptor for the guanylylation, is in close proximity to P34. At this stage, in the absence of information on the structure of alphavirus nsP1, it would be tempting to propose that MADPTs inhibit the GT reaction by hampering either the binding of m7GTP or the catalysis of the guanylylation itself. However, other possible scenarios that involve indirect effects cannot be ruled out.",

It could be that some alphaviruses have mechanisms to overcome defects in cap-synthesis activity. It was also shown recently that SINV produces non-capped viral genomic RNAs, especially in significant numbers during the early phase of infection29. It is not clear whether this is also the case for CHIKV or other alphaviruses. It may thus be that CHIKV does not have this mechanism and that it is therefore very sensitive to nsP1 inhibitors. The optimization of this compound series is still ongoing and we observed that the second generation of compounds has a modest antiviral activity against ONNV (EC50 values between 15\u201325 \u03bcM).",

In such case that the structure of the nsP1 of CHIKV or of another alphavirus would be resolved in the future, this could enable structure-based drug design of new classes of capping inhibitors. It remains to be studied (first in animal models) whether or not CHIKV inhibitors may have a beneficial effect on chronic infections of the joints with this virus. If this were to be the case, this will offer important options for the management of this debilitating condition.

Based on these data, the lowest concentration of compound and the highest virus input at which complete and reproducible inhibition of virus-induced CPE was observed were selected. In a second step, three 96-well plates (a total of 144 assay wells) containing adherent Vero A cells were infected with the most optimal virus dilution (50 CCID50) and compound concentration (93 \u03bcM). After 5 days of incubation, most assay wells did not show any signs of virus-induced cell death. However, in some wells, virus break-through could be observed and the supernatant of the 3 wells with the most pronounced signs of virus-induced CPE was collected. These samples were purified in 6-fold by titration (1:5 dilution series) in the presence of 93 \u03bcM of MADTP-314. Three virus isolates (one from each original sample) were selected that produced the most pronounced signs of CPE in the presence of MADTP-314 at the lowest virus input possible.

The sequences of the used oligonucleotides are available upon request. Constructs were verified by sequencing using the BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit v1.1 (Applied Biosystems) and a 3130 Genetic Analyzer automatic sequencer (Applied Biosystems). CHIKV was produced from these plasmids as described elsewhere19. Briefly, RNA was transcribed using the AmpliScribe T7 high yield transcription kit (Epicenter), the m7GpppA RNA cap structure analogue (NEB) and 0.7 \u03bcg of linearized template DNA. BHK-21 cells were electroporated with in vitro transcribed RNA using the Amaxa Nucleofector according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Infectious CHIKV from the supernatant of transfected cells (P0) harvested the day after transfection was used to grow working stocks (P1) of WT and mutant viruses on Vero E6 cells, which were used for further experiments. To confirm the presence of the introduced mutations (and absence of other mutations) the complete genomes of mutant viruses were sequenced by extracting viral RNA from virus stocks (P1) using the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen). This RNA was used to generate four overlapping amplicons by reverse transcriptase PCR amplification which were sequenced completely.",

In short, the codon optimized DNA encoding nsP1 of VEEV (strain P676, amino acid 1 to 535) was cloned into the expression vector pET28b (Novagen). Recombinant protein was produced in E. coli Rosetta pLysS (DE3) cells (Novagen), and then purified by IMAC chromatography. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the Quikchange site-directed mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene). The methyltransferase assay was carried out in a 20-\u03bcL reaction mixture, containing 50 mM Tris (pH 7.0), 2 mM DTT, 10 mM KCl, 2 mM GIDP, 330 nM S-adenosyl [methyl-3H] Methionine (83.1 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer), 10 \u03bcM S-adenosylmethionine, 2 \u03bcM VEEV nsP1, 5% DMSO, and increasing concentrations of MADTPs. After incubation at 30 \u00b0C for 1 h, the reaction samples were loaded on DEAE-cellulose filter (PerkinElmer), and the filter was washed twice with 20 mM ammonium formate, once with H2O, and once with absolute ethanol. The filter was dried, and the radioactivity was measured by scintillation counting with SCINT BETAPLATE solution in a Wallac MicroBeta Trilux 1450 counter (PerkinElmer). The VEEV nsP1 guanylylation reactions were performed in 20 \u03bcL buffer containing 50 mM Tris (pH 7.0), 2 mM MgCl2, 2 mM DTT, 10 \u03bcM m7GTP, 100 \u03bcM AdoHcy and 2 \u03bcM nsP1 and incubated 1 h at 30 \u00b0C. Next, reactions were stopped, and subjected to western blot or ELISA using firstly anti-m3G/m7G-cap monoclonal antibody (Synaptic Systems) and secondary peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse antibody (Sigma, #A9044). For the Western blot assay, the immunoreactive proteins were detected using the Pierce ECL Western Blotting Substrate (ThermoScientific) and a Kodak Image Station 4000MM Pro (Carestream Health, Inc.).
