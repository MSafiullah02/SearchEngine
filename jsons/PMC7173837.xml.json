Nearly 96% of the current global hydrogen is made from the hydrocarbon feedstock, and another 4% comes from water [2,5,6]. Not considering the cost of carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) which is essential for greenhouse gas abatement for fossil fuel pathways [7], hydrocarbon feedstock can render cheap hydrogen for industry applications [6,[8], [9], [10]]. While water electrolysis by renewable electricity is regarded as the cleanest commercial method to produce high-quality hydrogen for vehicular use, the wind- or solar-based electricity is still more expensive than the electricity generated from natural gas or coal [6,11]. The technical routes and the related investment, natural resource reserves and local energy/electricity price, etc., significantly affect the H2 production cost [12] which could vary between USD 1.21/kg-H2 to USD 24.0/kg-H2 [6].",

Hydrogen is stored and transported to destinations in gas, liquid or solid states, through natural gas pipelines, in pressurized tanks or cryogenic super-insulated vessels, or absorbed/bounded in metal/chemical hydrides, etc. [2,4]. Practically, compressed hydrogen gas stored in containers and transported with trailers is widely used for vehicular utilization at present and liquefied hydrogen is a prospect economical way of large-scale storage and long-journey transport [5]. When hydrogen arrives at the refueling station, it is stored in the on-site cylinders in compressed gas or liquid state and filled to FCVs in the compressed gas state under different pressures [2]. The process from H2 production to refueling is the hydrogen pathway for FCVs, which is illustrated in Fig. 1\n.",

            "text": "Different H2 economy is represented through various pathways. Apart from the technical routes, the location of projects, the distance between H2 sources and refueling stations, the geographical features and delivery infrastructure all influence the pathway chosen. For example, Ref. [13] used field data from the FCB bus project with \u201celectrolysis + power-to-gas (PtG)\u201d H2 pathway in Rhine-Main area in Germany, and simulated the H2 economy under different bus substitution scenarios and H2 pathways, concluding that a decentralized PtG plant and large scale H2 supply chain would be suitable for the area under study. According to Ref. [12], the levelized H2 cost varies from USD 4.7/kg-H2 (by distributed steam methane reforming) to USD 8.5/kg-H2 (by central electrolysis with wind power and pipeline transport), with a prospect cost target of USD 2\u20134/kg-H2 by distributed natural gas pathway in a mature market. However, the cost of H2 on arrival at the refueling station does not equal the price of H2 pumped into vehicles. Not like the industrial applications where hydrogen is usually used as direct feedstock, the FCVs need refueling stations that still have very high initial investment [14]. Generally, it takes around USD 2\u20133 million for one station and expected to drop to USD 1 million per station in the future [15].",

FCVs are proved technically viable with many advantages such as better energy efficiency, less pollution or emission, low noise and less smell [1,[16], [17], [18], [19]]. FCVs are especially suitable for long-journey and heavy-duty transport [20] and will be comprehensively competitive as substitutes for the conventional and battery vehicles in the next two decades [21]. Despite the potentiality, the high cost during the life cycle vehicle ownership, the lack of refueling infrastructure, and less competitive H2 end price, all hinder the adoption of FCVs [18,22,23], which in turn discourages investors to build more refueling stations or offer competitive H2 price due to non-profitability of H2 refueling service [24]. The positive correlation between H2 stations and FCVs means, the scaling up of either H2 market or vehicle market could break the chicken-egg dilemma and lead to the cost decline on both FCVs and H2 [14,25].",

Despite the technical viability of the various H2 pathways and FCV applications, still many economic uncertainties and risks hinder the investors and operators to act. From a life cycle perspective, water electrolysis by renewable electricity is the most suitable method to render zero-carbon hydrogen for vehicles in the long run [26]. But the cost of renewable H2 from water is very sensitive to electrolysis efficiency and the electricity price [6], and the latter one is influenced by the availability and reserves of water, wind, solar and other renewable resources and the investment of power plants and distribution grids [14,25]. Tube trailer delivery is the cheapest option for short journey transport (\u226450 km) due to its limited capacity, while liquid and pipeline delivery would be the options for large-volume and long-journey delivery. In addition to the H2 states and amount delivered, the geographical context also affects the cost of delivery [15]. Though the costs of H2 stations and FCVs are expected to decline with future deployment, the chicken-egg dilemma between H2 infrastructure and vehicles will hardly be broken without a vision of profits.",

This study aims to examine the hydrogen economy of FCVs with renewable H2 pathway under current technology in real projects.

With these early experiences, China gradually changed its marketing focus to commercial vehicles especially buses as the breakthrough of its ambitious plan of producing 100,000 FCVs by 2030 [29,33]. Unlike the developed countries that have already demonstrated dozens of FCBs accumulatively, China has demonstrated no more than 6 buses for each of its previous programs [16]. These programs in China tested FCBs with H2 supply from water electrolysis by grid electricity and feedstock H2 from the chemical industry, both relied heavily on fossil fuels from the life cycle perspective considering that 60% of China's grid electricity was from coal at that time [34]. The existing H2 pathways cannot provide life-cycle carbon-free H2 nor a competitive H2 price for FCBs, thus, increasing the utility of renewable electricity with low-price to produce H2 becomes a practical way to realize both economics and zero-emission of FCB commercialization [6]. As a result, the regions with rich renewable resources become hot spots for carbon-free H2 production and FCV deployment. Among these regions, Hebei is the first province that explicitly declared its plan of using renewable electricity to produce H2 and has deployed fuel cell transit buses for over one year on a small-scale basis in Zhangjiakou city since September 2018 [35].",

Despite the bus purchasing subsidy and the competitive fuel economy, the life cycle cost of the FCBs will continue to be more expensive than the diesel ones in the next 10 years. The coming CO2 trading scheme will be a remedy for such a big investment. A reasonable expectation of the future carbon price would be 1000\u20132000 RMB/ton [53], which could be very attractive for bus operators to gradually phase out their diesel buses. However, the most important benefit of FCB operation is not the monetary feedback directly from carbon sales which have been uncertain yet, but the social benefits from the environment, as well as the potential disincentives such as road limit that could cause inconvenience to diesel buses on road.",
