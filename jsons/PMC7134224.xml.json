In a mining environment, the environmental factors in the mining area could be extreme heat, dust, mechanical forces and rain. For any hardware to keep functioning, it must be able to withstand these elements. It is also crucial for the device to maintain operation within an industrial environment. If the hardware were to fail, it could mean safety incidents or production losses. Equipment should be highly reliable, robust, possess a high resilience to failure and be available whenever the process needs their functioning. In certain areas, hardware redundancy is in place to ensure that hardware in a particular process is backed up with a set of standby equipment in case of failure. The following minimum hardware needs to be in place for any IIoT implementation to be successful:IIoT devices.Considering the scalability of IIoT devices when they grow into the thousands was also cited as a consideration before the application of the IIoT hardware devices. The respondees mentioned that the questions during an implementation consideration: Would there be enough technical resources to install the magnitude of sensors required in installation going into the thousands of sensors? Also, is the supporting hardware that hosts the platforms able to process the amount of data?Networks and network coverage for the communication between the different layers.A hardware platform host could be in the cloud or on-premise. This hardware platform hosts the data storage, collection and contextualisation of the data. From the findings, it should be noted that if no reliable connectivity to the cloud is available, the storage, collection and contextualisation of the data needs to be handled on-site. This is in order not to expose the business to risk if there are communication interruptions to the cloud that could affect a critical process. An example could be when a manufacturing process that moulds plastic loses connectivity to the cloud and the process halts.
