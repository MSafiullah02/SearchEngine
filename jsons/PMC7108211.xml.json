The enrolled case was a healthcare worker who might have been exposed by another coworker, who also lived in the case\u2019s household; therefore, the enrolled case was a result of either household or healthcare transmission prior to this investigation\u2019s initiation. The case not enrolled in this investigation was exposed in the household. Household contacts were defined as any person who stayed at least 1 night at the same location as the case patient during the 14 days prior to the case patient\u2019s symptom onset or the date of first positive specimen if the case patient was asymptomatic. Excluded cases included palace workers and other high-level officials; their associated household contacts were also excluded.",

The neutralization titer was measured as the reciprocal of the highest serum dilution that completely inhibited Vero cell lysis in at least 1 of the 3 triplicate wells. Positive and negative controls were included for each MNT performed and included back-titration and mock-infected cells. Titers of \u22651:20 were reported as positive. All work with live MERS-CoV was done in Biosafety Level 3 containment at the CDC. Immunofluorescence assays (IFAs) were performed by screening sera at a dilution of 1:50 and 1:100 on paraformaldehyde-fixed, acetone-methanol permeabilized MERS-CoV (strain MERS-CoV Hu/England-N1/2012) infected or uninfected control Vero cells. Antihuman immunoglobulin G, M, and A fluorescein isothiocyanate conjugate was used to detect anti\u2013MERS-CoV antibodies in human serum, and nuclei were counterstained with 4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole to allow identification of individual MERS-CoV\u2013infected cells. Fluorescence was detected using a Zeiss AxioImager fluorescence microscope. The positive control for the assay is a serum sample from a patient infected with MERS-CoV Hu/England-N1/2012. A positive result was scored when these 3 conditions were met: Cells were evenly stained (instead of punctate staining); fluorescence intensity was higher than that of the negative controls; and signal intensity declined with serial dilution. A minimum of 2 negative controls were included with each IFA. Approximately 10% of specimens negative by nucleocapsid ELISA were screened by both IFA and MNT to confirm the negative result.",

            "text": "There are several limitations to this investigation. First, serum samples were collected at varying intervals after illness onset for each case patient, potentially affecting serology results. The duration of antibody response is unknown. Second, recall bias might have led to the misclassification of symptom severity among household contacts; however, for case patients, to minimize this bias, we relied upon retrospective medical chart review, though this also might not be as complete since it depended on the initial healthcare provider\u2019s history and physical. Third, these case patients were immediately isolated in hospitals after PCR-positive results were discovered. The removal from the household setting might have reduced exposure to household contacts although the case patients were residing with household contacts at the time of the contact investigations. Last, because our investigation did not detect household transmission, we cannot comment on any behaviors or exposures that would increase risk among household contacts of case patients.",

            "text": "In summary, we did not document additional household transmission in this investigation that included a preponderance of asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic confirmed MERS-CoV case patients. Our investigation findings support the recommendation to consider home isolation for asymptomatic and mildly ill cases that do not require hospitalization while using proper precautions, including face masks, frequent hand washing, and minimizing exposure to the case patient in the household [20, 21, 33]. While no vaccines or antivirals against MERS-CoV are currently available, reducing transmission through effective infection control management remains a major priority. Understanding transmission risk for different MERS-CoV\u2013infected patients who live in different settings will be important data that must be factored into prevention strategies. Further studies on human-to-human transmission in different settings should be conducted to inform MERS-CoV prevention and control guidelines.",
