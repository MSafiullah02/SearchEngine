Patients selected for analysis had acute nonresponsive community-acquired (broncho)pneumonia (NR-CAP group) or recurrent community-acquired (broncho)pneumonia (Rec-CAP group). NR-CAP case patients were defined according to current pediatric CAP guidelines [15] as patients with persistent fever (>38.5\u00b0C) and persistent elevated infection parameters in the peripheral blood, associated in some cases with worsening consolidation visible on chest radiographs after at least 48 h of antibiotic treatment. The Rec-CAP group had an episode of CAP with a history of at least 2 other CAP episodes. Exclusion criteria included the presence of severe and chronic conditions (such as cystic fibrosis, primary ciliary disease, immune deficiency, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, cardiopathy, neuromuscular diseases, asplenia, and tuberculosis) and nosocomial respiratory tract infection.",

However, most of these studies involved URT samples, and thus had limited specificity for detecting bacterial pathogens, with few studies involving samples of the LRT or lung aspirates [3, 21, 22]. Among the aerobic bacteria, which were isolated in approximately half of infections, we found a predominance of NTHi in both groups of children; approximately three-quarters were H. influenzae, of which 97.9% were NTHi. To our knowledge, this is the first such reported finding since those of Shann et al [22] and Weinberg et al [23] in the 1980s. Since then, studies involving children with CAP or LRT infection (using serological testing or TNA) have suggested a possible role for NTHi in pediatric pneumonia but have failed to define it as a significant pathogen [24]. For example, in a recent study involving 34 children with CAP, 16 cases were attributed to S. pneumoniae and no case of H. influenzae infection was found using TNA [25]. However, the study included a small number of patients and investigated lobar CAP only. It is also possible that NTHi infection was missed in previous studies of pediatric CAP because the methodology was not appropriate for NTHi detection. NTHi does not easily invade the bloodstream or pleura [22, 26], and misclassification of NTHi strains as Hib strains using the slide agglutination technique has been reported [27]. Also, in many TNA studies, the culture media used were not appropriate for detecting H. influenzae and, if H. influenzae was found, strains were not serotyped [22].",

NTHi is associated with persistent, nonresponsive acute otitis media (AOM) [28, 29], possibly attributable to the choice of treatment (amoxicillin is used as first-line treatment), leading to the selection of \u03b2-lactamase\u2013positive H. influenzae [29]. This was not the case in our study, because 77% of NTHi isolates were \u03b2-lactamase negative. In AOM, NTHi has a clear association with recurrence >1 month after the completion of antibiotic therapy, with an incidence of 32% in third and subsequent episodes [29]. NTHi infection contributes to complications in AOM and is clinically indistinguishable from AOM caused by S. pneumoniae [29]. It is therefore possible that, as in AOM, NTHi is not an innocent bystander in the LRT. Indeed, it is now increasingly recognized that NTHi is capable of causing invasive disease, particularly neonatal sepsis, and is also a cause of CAP, bacteremia and, to a lesser extent, meningitis [30, 31].",

            "text": "The relatively low detection rates for M. pneumoniae and C. pneumoniae may be related to the young age of the patients, because atypical infections are most common in children >5 years of age [20, 38, 39]. M. pneumoniae was a predominant pathogen in the NR-CAP group but not in the Rec-CAP group. Most of the patients with NR-CAP had been treated with penicillin or aminopenicillins, the first-line antibiotics for treatment of CAP, and the predominance of M. pneumoniae gives a possible reason for nonresponsiveness. Viruses were found in 30.4% of cases, with RSV, parainfluenzaviruses, and influenzaviruses being detected most frequently. This incidence is relatively low, compared with the findings of other studies [5, 20], and may have been due to omission of rhinovirus in the PCR assay. Virus detection was slightly more frequent in the NR-CAP group. Viruses were the sole pathogen more than twice as often in the NR-CAP group than in the Rec-CAP group, possibly providing another explanation for nonresponsiveness to initial antibiotic therapy. Viral coinfections, which were found in 6.4% of cases overall, are rarely reported in most studies of CAP, although one study reported an incidence of 14% for all CAP cases and 22% for viral CAP cases [5]. Mixed infections were found in 24.4% of cases, which was comparable to previous findings [19, 20, 40].",

In contrast to other reports, we found NTHi to be a major bacterial pathogen, possibly because of improved detection with FOB plus BAL. This finding might explain cases of nonresponsiveness to antibiotic treatment or recurrence in pediatric CAP, similar to observations in AOM, which is frequently associated with NTHi infection. Additional research is needed to elucidate the pathogenic mechanisms of NTHi in pediatric CAP. However, our findings suggest that the burden of pediatric CAP could be reduced by addressing NTHi as a major causative pathogen in treatment and prevention strategies.",
