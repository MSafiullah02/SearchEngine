Additionally, when laboratory animals are used as models for infectious disease studies, exposure to microbial pathogens presents a threat to human health. Also, with the recognition of emerging diseases, some of which are zoonotic, constant vigilance and surveillance of laboratory animals for zoonotic diseases are still required.",

Suspected modes of transmission between nonhuman primates include aerosol, direct contact, and biting insects (Wachtman and Mansfield, 2012). Transmission of monkeypox from captive nonhuman primate populations to humans has not been recorded. The first reported case of human monkeypox outside of Africa occurred in the Midwestern United States in June 2003 following the importation of 800 West African small rodents for the pet trade, six of which (two rope squirrels (Funisciurus spp.), one Gambian giant rat (Cricetomys spp.), and three dormice (Graphiurus)) were later shown to be infected with the West African clade of monkeypox virus (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 2003, Guarner et al., 2004). The infected rodents were co-housed with black-tailed prairie dogs (Cynomys ludovicianus) who contracted the disease and then served as the source of a human monkeypox disease outbreak with 87 reported (37 laboratory-confirmed) human cases (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 2003, Parker et al., 2007). Infection was also identified in hamsters (Cricetus spp.), gerbils (Gerbillus spp.), and chinchillas (Chinchilla spp.) cohoused with the infected animals (Parker et al., 2007). As a result of this outbreak, U.S. importation of African rodents and interstate transportation of prairie dogs and select African rodents was banned. Human-to-human and zoonotic transmission of this agent is low and has occurred presumably through close contact with active lesions, recently contaminated fomites, or respiratory secretions (CDC, 1997; Damon, 2011; Ligon, 2004).",

Unlike most other poxviruses, monkeypox has a wide host range. It is endemic in some wild populations whose geographic ranges increasingly overlap with encroaching human populations, many of which have increasingly high numbers of immunocompromised individuals. These factors increase the potential for human transmission (Parker et al., 2007). Within human populations, infections occur in small clusters, not larger outbreaks as is typical with smallpox (Reid and Dagleish, 2011). Smallpox vaccination provides partial and limited-term protection against the development and severity of monkeypox disease in both humans and nonhuman primates (Reynolds et al., 2012).",

The virus is not naturally transmitted directly between humans or between nonhuman primates. Although multiple genuses of mosquitos can be infected and transmit the disease, the Aedes spp. (Stegomyia spp.) mosquito is of primary importance due to its feeding habits and the ability of the virus to persist in the insect over the dry season by transovarian transmission (Wachtman and Mansfield, 2012). Two forms of the disease are recognized based on the cyclic transmission between vertebrate hosts and mosquito vectors. In the jungle (sylvatic) form, disease transmission occurs most commonly between tree-hole breeding mosquitoes (e.g., A. africanus in Africa, Haemagogus spp. in Central and South America) and nonhuman primates residing in the forest canopy. Virus transmission to humans occurs where the human and mosquito ranges overlap such as during forestry activities that disrupt mosquito feeding preferences. Once introduced into a human population, the urban (rural) form of disease transmission may develop in which the virus is transmitted between individuals by peridomestic mosquitoes (predominantly Aedes aegypti) which breed well in urban settings and feed on humans (Blanchard and Russell-Lodrigue, 2012, Monath and Staples, 2011).",

However, in the natural outbreak of Ebola-Reston infection in a laboratory colony of nonhuman primates, transmission occurred among animals without apparent direct intimate contact, suggesting the possibility of airborne or aerosol transmission. Three of six animal technicians working with these animals developed antibody response to Ebola-Reston virus, but the details of transmission were not determined in all cases. One of these individuals was infected during postmortem examination of an infected monkey (Ksiazek et al., 1999). Epidemiologic findings in animal caretakers working in the Philippine-source colony for Ebola-Reston-infected nonhuman primates suggest that the transmission of Ebola-Reston to humans is rare (Miranda et al., 1999).",

Infection of animal caretakers and research personnel has resulted from the introduction of infected wild rodents into the laboratory animal facility environment as well as biologics derived or contaminated by them.

Rodent infestations are common in zoos and mice, as known carriers of LCMV are the probable source of infection in these outbreaks. Some outbreaks have been traced to the feeding of neonatal mice (\u2018pinkies\u2019) from enzootically infected mouse populations to callitrichids (Montali et al., 1993). Interestingly, two veterinarians involved in the care of infected callitrichids seroconverted to the agent but did not develop clinical signs of disease (Blanchard and Russell-Lodrigue, 2012). The pathologic lesions observed in LCMV-infected callitrichids share many similarities with those of humans infected with another Arenavirus in sub-Saharan Africa, Lassa hemorrhagic fever virus. As a result, callitrichids have been proposed as an animal model of human Lassa disease.",

Under some circumstances, LCMV produces a pantropic infection and may be copiously present in the blood, cerebrospinal fluid, urine, nasopharyngeal secretions, feces, and tissues of natural hosts and possibly humans. In endemically infected mouse and hamster colonies, the infection is transmitted in utero or early in the neonatal period, producing a tolerant infection characterized by chronic viremia and viruria without significant clinical disease. Thus, bedding material and other fomites contaminated by LCMV-infected animals can be important sources of infection for humans, as demonstrated in numerous outbreaks among laboratory animal technicians (Dykewicz et al., 1992, Newcomer and Fox, 2007, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 2012b). Exposure of adult, immunocompetent mice most frequently results in a transient infection with seroconversion although persistent infection with wasting may develop following immune exhaustion (Maclachlan et al., 2011b).

Open wire cages were correlated with the highest rate of infection, whereas deep boxes and aquariums were associated with a lower human infection rate. Similarly, cage placement in an area of high human activity was associated with infection, but cages located away from areas of frequent human activity (e.g., the basement) did not result in infection of occupants (Biggar et al., 1975). Also, infections are known to occur in individuals who have not had direct physical contact with infected hamsters but who had simply entered the room housing the animals (Hinman et al., 1975). These findings suggest that airborne transmission plays an important role in human infection.

Fatal human cases have been characterized by severe pharyngitis, fever, bleeding abnormalities, pneumonia, and hepatic triaditis.

A hemorrhagic fever-like disease was noted in some of these individuals (CDC, 2008). It is postulated that the severity of disease in transplant recipients is largely influenced by their induced immunosuppression (Fischer et al., 2006).

These assays are not useful to diagnose persistently infected, immune tolerant mice, as circulating antibodies may not be present at detectable levels. RT-PCR should be used in these circumstances and to screen biologic materials (e.g., cell lines, tumors, serum). The virus does grow easily in many cell types but produces minimal cytopathic effects. Therefore, cell cultures must be assayed for antigen detection (Charrel and de Lamballerie, 2010, Maclachlan et al., 2011b). Depopulation of infected colonies is highly recommended. Prevention of this disease in animal facilities is achieved through the periodic serological surveillance of both new animals with inadequate disease profiles and resident animal colonies at risk. Screening all biologics intended for animal passage for the presence of LCMV is another crucial element in the program to prevent the introduction of LCMV into established animal colonies. The exclusion of wild rodent vermin and the elimination of ectoparasites and insect vectors from animal facilities are part of the overall scheme for LCMV disease prevention and are expected of modern laboratory animal facilities.",

Only macaque monkeys (e.g., rhesus, cynomolgus, and pig-tailed macaques) are known to naturally harbor B virus (Cohen et al., 2002). The virus has been detected in the saliva, urine, feces, and nervous tissue of infected macaques as well as cell cultures derived from their tissues. The virus persists latently in the trigeminal and lumbosacral ganglia of the macaque with occasional reactivation of viral shedding from peripheral sites in asymptomatic animals in response to physical or psychological stressors or during periods of immunosuppression (Estep et al., 2010, Simmons, 2010). The infection is transmitted between macaques by virus-laden secretions through close contact involving primarily the oral, conjunctival, and genital mucous membranes (Weigler et al., 1995). Infection of other nonhuman primate species can be fatal although select Old World monkey species have been shown to be seropositive to B virus, indicating that they may also be potential disease reservoirs (Kalter et al., 1997).",

The use of a face shield is insufficient as the sole method for protection against ocular exposure because droplet splashes to the head may drain into the eyes and infectious materials may enter via the gap along the margins of the shield.

Patients should have direct and immediate access to local medical consultants knowledgeable about B virus and versed in current B virus treatment recommendations as prescribed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the B Virus Working Group (Cohen et al., 2002). Prompt and thorough cleaning of the exposure site is vital after which serum samples and cultures should be obtained for serology and viral isolation from both the patient and the macaque. Antiviral therapy (e.g., valacylovir or acyclovir) may also be warranted based on the nature of the exposure (e.g., deep puncture bite, mucosal exposure), the interval between exposure and cleaning of the exposure site, and a positive culture of B virus from the patient or nonhuman primate (Cohen et al., 2002). However, antiviral therapy is not without risk to the patient and may complicate diagnostic testing. The administration of antiviral therapy in patients diagnosed with B virus infection is controversial because increasing antibody titer has been demonstrated in a patient following its discontinuation (Cohen et al., 2002). The determination of the most efficacious antiviral(s) for use is ongoing (Krug et al., 2010). Physicians should consult the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Disease, Division of Viral Diseases, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, for assistance in case management.

The disease course proceeds through several phases: incubation, prodrome state, acute neurologic period, coma, and death (CDC, 2010a). The incubation period in humans is ordinarily 1\u20133 months but may vary from 9 days to over 8 months. During the 2- to 4-day prodromal stage, patients experience a period of apprehension and develop headache, malaise, and fever. An abnormal, indefinite sensation at the exposure site is the first specific symptom. Patients may also develop intermittent periods of excitation, nervousness, or anxiety interspersed with quiet periods when the mental state appears normal. Further progression of the disease is marked by paresis or paralysis, inability to swallow, hydrophobia, delirium, convulsions, and coma. Few individuals recover from rabies infection; once clinical signs develop, the disease is almost invariably fatal from an acute viral encephalomyelitis followed by respiratory paralysis (Banyard and Fooks, 2011, Hemachudha et al., 2013).",

However, it is unclear what role other underlying health factors may have played in this increased fatality rate (Meng, 2010a).

Under experimental conditions, swine HEV strains are infectious for nonhuman primates and the human strains of HEV are infectious to pigs. In addition, pig handlers (e.g., swine veterinarians, swine farmers) have a significantly higher rate of seroconversion to HEV than does the general population (Huang et al., 2002). Swine infection is widespread and worldwide. In the United States, the sero\u00adprevalence rate of swine HEV infection ranges between 50 and 100% in some herds (Lhomme et al., 2013). Infection occurs in farmed pigs between 2 and 4 months of age, presumably by fecal\u2013oral transmission, with a transient viremia followed by fecal shedding (Huang et al., 2002, Meng, 2011). Given this, domestic pigs are recognized as likely reservoirs of HEV for the human population.",

However, disease has not resulted following experimental transmission of the avian virus to other species including nonhuman primates, suggesting that the avian strain does not present a significant zoonotic threat. Other animals including farmed rabbits, wild rats, wild boar, bats, mongeese, and deer are susceptible to HEV infection and are being evaluated as potential sources of human disease (Cossaboom et al., 2011, Lhomme et al., 2013, Meng, 2011). Of these, rabbit HEV is of greatest concern as antibody titers, suggestive of infection, have been detected in rabbit farms in the United States and China, and experimental infection of pigs has been demonstrated (Cossaboom et al., 2012). Some species (e.g., tamarins, owls monkeys, and cynomolgus monkeys) are susceptible to experimental infection and antibody response to HEV has been detected in wild-caught macaques. Nonhuman primates are not considered likely disease reservoirs although disease transmission from nonhuman primates to humans should not be discounted (Wachtman and Mansfield, 2012).",

Hepatitis B virus (HBV), caused by a human hepadnavirus, has been widely studied experimentally in the chimpanzee although the gibbon, orangutan, and wooly monkey are known to be susceptible (MacDonald et al., 2000). Natural HBV infection was first noted by demonstration of HBV surface antigen in cynomologus in 1985 (Kornegay et al., 1985). Recently, wild-living cynomolgus macaques from Mauritius Island were diagnosed with natural, chronic infection of a genotype of HBV distinct from the human genotype. The disease appears relatively benign in the infected animals. The zoonotic risk of the cynomolgus genotype is yet unknown (Dupinay et al., 2013). It is postulated that infected cynomolgus monkeys may serve as a useful animal model of the disease. Other natural hepadnavirus infections of animals (woodchuck, ground squirrel, and duck) are used as animal models of HBV infection, but none are transmissible to humans (Blanchard and Russell-Lodrigue, 2012). The chimpanzee has been used as an experimental model for the study of hepatitis C and D viruses. Thus, the concern for hepatitis B, C, and D as zoonoses is minimal in the laboratory animal facility environment except where these agents are used in experimental animal studies. In these cases, personnel should adhere to appropriate precautions when handling nonhuman primates.",

Serologic evidence of human infection exists in West African populations as well as those with occupational exposure to nonhuman primates. In addition, the virus has been isolated from one patient with AIDS and lymphoma but with no known nonhuman primate contact (Murphy et al., 2006, Wachtman and Mansfield, 2012). Overall, the degree of the risk for zoonotic transmission of SRV remains unclear.",

Infection rates in many wild and captive nonhuman primate colonies approach 100% with transmission suspected to occur through exposure to saliva (e.g., contamination of deep fight wounds) and possibly blood. A wide range of animal species have been experimentally infected with SFV. No evidence of pathogenicity has been detected in these species or the natural nonhuman primate hosts although lifelong, stable virus persistence is suspected (Khan, 2009). Human infection with SFV has been documented with no apparent ill effects. The virus has recently been detected in the saliva of infected humans (Huang et al., 2012). Human-to-human transmission has not been detected, suggesting that humans may serve as dead-end hosts. In Africa and Asia, human infection is believed to result from contact with infected wild nonhuman primates, especially during their hunting, butchering, or consumption (Khan, 2009). It is debatable if a human foamy virus variant exists. However, foamy virus infections have been confirmed on multiple occasions. The first was reported in 1971 from the cell culture of an East African patient with nasopharyngeal carcinoma. The isolated foamy virus was, based on immunologic and sequence data, judged to be closely related to a chimpanzee foamy virus (Heneine et al., 1998, Schweizer et al., 1997). The second case involved an animal handler employed at a research institute for over 20 years and who had suffered multiple bite wounds from African green monkeys. The worker became seropositive for foamy virus within 6 years of employment. African green monkey foamy virus DNA was later detected in his peripheral blood mononuclear cells, indicating persistent yet asymptomatic infection (Schweizer et al., 1997). A subsequent survey of U.S. and Canadian workers with occupational exposure to nonhuman primates revealed evidence of SFV infection via serology, proviral DNA detection, and/or virus isolation in 4 of the 231 individuals tested. Each of the four was employed at different institutions. Three individuals were infected with SFV of baboon origin, one with SFV of African green monkey origin. Infection was asymptomatic in all four individuals and evidence of infection was not found among their close contacts, including the three spouses tested (Heneine et al., 1998). From these and other confirmed cases of human infection (Gessain et al., 2013, Switzer et al., 2004), it is now assumed that human infections with SFV result in a latent, asymptomatic infection with minimal risk for human-to-human transmission.\n",

Within these nonhuman primate populations, the seroprevalence of infection may, depending on animal species, approach 100%. With the current emphasis on and success of domestic nonhuman primate production, it has become more likely that institutions will develop large populations of susceptible nonhuman primates that could contract measles and then transmit the disease to susceptible humans.",

Macaques and other species of Old World primates commonly develop a mild upper respiratory infection although asymptomatic infections occur. Clinical signs most frequently seen in Old World monkeys include nasal and ocular discharge, conjunctivitis, facial edema, blepharitis, and a maculopapular skin rash. The rash first develops on the ventral body surface then becomes generalized before ultimately progressing to a dry and scaly desquamative dermatitis. Immunosuppression is common. Occasionally, measles infection progresses to depression, anorexia, coughing, and dyspnea in conjunction with giant cell pneumonia. Abortions and neurologic signs have also been reported. Koplik\u2019s spots inconsistently appear on the buccal mucosa (Wachtman and Mansfield, 2012). Morbidity is high and mortality, caused by secondary bacterial infections, is low in Old World monkeys. The disease is much more severe in marmosets, owl monkeys, and colobines in which hemorrhagic gastroenteritis and immunosuppression predominate and respiratory tract lesions and the skin rash are absent or less significant. To mitigate the possibility of introducing the virus into a susceptible monkey population, personnel working with these primates should have a measles virus antibody titer to assess their immunity to the virus.",

Rickettsiae are ingested by a blood meal of the flea, where they multiply in the gut, and are subsequently passed out in the dejecta of the flea. Infection in the rat and the human is the result of contamination of the puncture wound by flea feces (Farhang-Azad et al., 1985). Experimental evidence indicates that a flea bite can also directly transmit the infection (Farhang-Azad et al., 1985). R. typhi are resistant to drying and remain infectious for up to 100 days in rat feces.",

Because murine typhus is difficult to differentiate either clinically or anatomically from other rickettsial diseases, specific serological tests or PCR-based assays are extremely important in making the correct diagnosis (Farhang-Azad et al., 1985). The acute febrile disease is usually characterized by general malaise, headache, rash, and chills, with signs ranging from mild to severe. An encephalitic syndrome can also occur (Mushatt and Hyslop, 1991). In one report, 25% of 180 patients with the disease had delirium, stupor, or coma. Fortunately, these findings resolve with lowering of the febrile response. Fatality rate for all ages is about 2% but increases with age. Proper antibiotic therapy is the most effective measure to prevent morbidity or mortality due to rickettsial infections and has been shown to be effective in hastening recovery and preventing neurologic sequelae, such as deafness due to eighth cranial nerve involvement (Mushatt and Hyslop, 1991). Doxycycline, tetracycline, and chloramphenicol are considered agents of choice.",

The prevalence of the infection among sheep is high throughout the United States, and sheep have been the primary species associated with disease outbreaks associated with research animal facilities (Anderson et al., 2013).

Thus, a broad range of domestic and wild animal species, including birds, should be given consideration as potential sources for Q fever infection in animal care and use activities (To et al., 1998).

The primary method of transmission is through infectious aerosols. The organism produces a spore-like form that is resistant to desiccation and persists in the environment for long periods of time, contributing to the widespread dissemination of infectious aerosols and resulting in infections miles from the original organism source (Franz et al., 1997, Tissot-Dupont et al., 1999). The importance of these factors was illustrated in outbreaks of the disease associated with the use of pregnant sheep in research facilities in the United States (Bernard et al., 1982). In these outbreaks, personnel who did not have direct contact with infected sheep but who worked along the transport routes for these animals became serologically positive for Q fever (Bernard et al., 1982, Reimer, 1993). Also, five of nine laundry workers without direct sheep contact but who processed linens soiled during sheep surgery developed serological evidence of infection.",

The disease often presents as an acute flu-like illness with fever, frontal headache with retro-orbital pain, and chest pain with a nonproductive cough and pneumonia, resolving within 2 weeks of infection. However, serious extrapulmonary complications, such as acute or chronic hepatitis, nephritis, epicarditis, and endocarditis, may also occur. Individuals with valvular heart disease should not work with C. burnetii due to the prospect of serious, chronic, relapsing infection (Asher, 1989, Chosewood and Wilson, 2009). A linkage between Q fever and a chronic fatigue syndrome is also suspected (Ayres et al., 1998).",

Multiple commercial vendors now supply sheep from closed, SPF flocks that have been serologically negative for an extended period. Although serological status is not a reliable indicator of organism shedding in an individual sheep, many institutions have elected to use these animals, reasoning that cumulative and consistent negative Q fever serology on a herd basis provides a reasonably strong assurance of Q fever-free status. Advances in PCR methods have improved the sensitivity of C. burnetii detection over that of the antigen capture ELISA, as well as improved the speed, safety, and convenience of the assay. The PCR method allows for the assessment of organism shedding, which may provide an option to minimize the potential risk of Q fever outbreaks in animal facilities (Lorenz et al., 1998, Yanase et al., 1998). However, shedding can be sporadic, and diagnostic samples such as amniotic fluid and placenta are not readily available antemortem. A combination of colony health components such as acquisition from a \u2018clean\u2019 flock, serological testing of incoming animals with follow-up postmortem PCR screening can be combined for a comprehensive program to minimize Q fever risks.",

A proposal to split a number of species into the new genus Chlamydophila has been published (Everett et al., 1999), but it has not been uniformly adopted by the scientific community and the latest edition of Bergey\u2019s Manual retains the designation of these species as Chlamydia spp. (Kuo et al., 2010). Chlamydial species are widely distributed among birds and mammals worldwide and occur naturally among many laboratory animal species, including birds, mice, guinea pigs, hamsters, rabbits, ruminants, swine, cats, ferrets, muskrats, and frogs (Storz, 1971, Newcomer et al., 1982). Of these host species, birds with Chlamydia psittaci infection, particularly psittacines, have proven to be the most frequent sources of virulent human infection (CDCP, 1997); however, infections with C. abortus in ruminants (Hyde and Benirschke, 1997, Jorgesen, 1997) and C. felis in cats (Cotton and Partridge, 1998) also have the potential to cause human disease. The most common human chlamydial infection, C. trachomatis, is not naturally transmissible to animals but is used to produce experimental infections in nonhuman primates. C. muridarium occurring in the mouse and C. suis occurring in the pig are closely related to C. trachomatis but are not infectious for humans. C. caviae has been isolated from the guinea pig. C. pecorum produces intestinal infection in ruminants and other animals but not in humans. C. pneumoniae produces respiratory infections in humans and related biovars have been isolated from the koala, horse, frog, and reptiles (Bodetti, et al., 2002). Zoonotic infections from animal-related biovars of Chlamydia pneumoniae have not been recorded, but genomic studies suggest that one or more animal-to-human transmission events led to the establishment of the human C. pneumonia biovar (Roulis et al., 2013).",

            "text": "Animals in general have a complex oral microflora consisting of numerous bacterial species; both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria are therefore routinely isolated from traumatic bite wounds inflicted by domestic and wild animals. Common organisms isolated from dog bites include Staphylococcus species, Streptococcus species, including S. canis and a variety of anaerobes, and Pasteurella multocida (Takeda et al., 2001, Bert and Lambert-Zechovsky, 1997). Also, a case of zoonotic transmission of S. equi subsp. zooepidemicus from a dog to its handler, via wound infection or aerosols, has been recently reported (Abbott et al., 2010). In a comprehensive multicenter study, 60% of dog bite wounds were punctures, 10% were lacerations, and 30% were a combination of both. This compared to 85% of cat bite wounds being punctures, 3% lacerations, and 12% a combination of both. In this study, 39% of 57 patients with cat bites presented as purulent wounds, whereas abscesses were present in 19% of the cases reviewed (Talan et al., 1999). Of the 50 patients with dog bites, 58% had purulent wounds, 30% were nonpurulent, and 12% were noted to have abscesses. Dog and cat bites had a mean of five bacterial species per wound; 63% of the cat bites analyzed compared to 48% of dog bites had a mixed anaerobic and aerobic population (Talan et al., 1999). Only aerobes grew in 36% of the cases (42% of dog bites and 32% cat bites), whereas anaerobes were the only species grown in 1% of the cases. Capnocytophaga canimorsus, an invasive organism, was recovered from 4.7% of the wounds. It should be noted that if fever occurs in immunocompromised patients (including asplenic individuals) after a bite wound, this organism should be considered in the differential diagnosis. Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae was isolated from two cat bite wounds, whereas Pasteurella spp. were present in the wounds 75% of the time in cats and 50% in dogs. Geographic locale is also important in defining bacterial flora of bites and scratches. In a study conducted in the southwestern and central United States, 17 of 1041 (1.6%) of the cases of tularemia in humans diagnosed from 1981 to 1987 were associated with cat scratches or bites (Taylor et al., 1991).",

The disease can also occur in individuals who have no history of rat bites but reside or work in rat-infested areas.

It is suspected that the organism is shed in the feces of the flea and can result in the transmission of the organism from cat to cat and from cat to human via mucous membrane or skin contact. Subsequently there is self-inoculation by scratching the flea bite, or alternatively by having the contaminated claws or teeth of cats inoculate the organism into traumatized skin. Importantly, several surveys have shown that cats can be chronically infected with B. henselae, with the organism capable of being isolated from blood of asymptomatic cats over an extended period of time (Koehler et al., 1994, Goldstein and Greene, 2009). Impounded or stray cats are more likely to be chronically infected than cats maintained in a household long term.",

Cricetid rodents, such as the wood rat, are occasionally cited as reservoir hosts. The oriental rat flea, X. cheopis, the common vector of plague, is well established throughout the United States, particularly in the southern states and southern California. It is important to remember that more than 1500 species of fleas and 230 species of rodents are infected with Y. pestis. Only 30\u201340 rodent species, however, are permanent reservoirs of the infection (Macy, 1999). Plague is infrequently reported in the United States, with a low of one case in 1972 and a high of 40 cases in 1983 (Craven and Barnes, 1991). Ninety percent of the cases have been diagnosed in New Mexico, Colorado, and California. Urban development (particularly in New Mexico) encroached into plague-enzootic rodent habitats, placing human populations at increased risk of contracting the disease. In addition to rodent epizootics, dogs, and increasingly cats, either have served as passive transporters of the disease or have been actively infected (Rosner, 1987). The disease has seasonal peaks, with the highest proportion occurring May through September.",

In the 1950s, in a study conducted in Baltimore, 45.5% of 1643 rats were infected with Leptospira; higher prevalence rates occurred in older rats (approximately 60%). In the late 1970s, more than 90% of adult Brown Norway rats sampled in Detroit were infected with L. icterohaemorrhagiae (Thiermann, 1977). Other studies confirm the high prevalence of this organism in wild rats inhabiting U.S. cities (Alexander, 1984, Sanger and Thiermann, 1988). Rodent reservoir hosts of leptospirosis, in addition to rats, include mice, field moles, hedgehogs, gerbils, squirrels, rabbits, and hamsters (Torten, 1979, Fox and Lipman, 1991). Livestock serve as a significant source of primary long-term shedding of at least three serovars. Cattle are the natural carriers of the serotype L. hardjo, whereas swine carry L. pomona and L. bratislava; each animal can shed the organism for extended periods in their urine. Dogs also commonly harbor two other serotypes; feral dogs harbor L. icterohaemorrhagiae as well as serve as natural carrier hosts of L. canicola. Sheep, goats, and horses can also be infected with a variety of serotypes. Raccoons are reservoirs of L. autumnalis and L. grippotyhosa, whereas rats, mice, and other wild rodents are common animal hosts for another serotype, L. ballum. In wild mice, the infection can persist unnoticed for the animal\u2019s lifetime and can also be harbored by laboratory mice, although their carrier rates in the United States are unknown (Torten, 1979). There was, however, a report of leptospirosis in a research colony of mice in the United States in the early 1980s (Alexander, 1984). In several European laboratories, personnel have contracted leptospires from laboratory rats (Geller, 1979).",

Skin abrasions or mucous membrane exposure may serve as the portal of entry in humans. All secretions and excretions from infected animals should be considered infective. In one instance, a father apparently was infected after his daughter used his toothbrush to clean a contaminated pet mouse cage. Handling infected wild rats increases the risk of contracting leptospires (Luzzi et al., 1987). Also, a young man died of acute leptospirosis by falling into a heavily polluted river contaminated with L. icterohaemorrhagiae (Sanger and Thiermann, 1988). In addition, rodent bites can transmit the disease. Children living in rat-infested tenements may be at increased risk of infection. For example, children from inner-city Detroit had significantly higher L. icterohaemorrhagiae antibody titers when compared to those of children living in the Detroit suburbs (Demers et al., 1983). It is important to note that leptospirosis can infect hosts on a chronic basis, by colonizing their kidney tubules. Outbreaks of leptospirosis in humans with varying mortality in underdeveloped countries have been documented in 1995\u20131998.",

Individuals infected with Leptospira spp. experience a biphasic disease (Sanger and Thiermann, 1988, Faine, 1991). They become suddenly ill with weakness, headache, myalgia, malaise, chills, and fever, and usually exhibit leukocytosis. During the second phase of the disease, which is immunologically mediated, conjunctival suffusion and a rash may occur (Fig. 28.7\n). On examination, renal, hepatic, pulmonary, and gastrointestinal findings may be abnormal. The most severe form of the diseases, known as Weil\u2019s disease, is characterized by hepatic and renal dysfunction, hemorrhage, and circulatory collapse (Bharti et al., 2003, Levett, 2001). Treatment of the disease is controversial given the disease is self-limiting. Penicillin is the drug of choice in treating early onset of leptospirosis infection (Vinetz, 2003). Comparison of penicillins to ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, and doxycycline in cases of severe leptospirosis indicated that all of these antibiotics were equally efficacious in reducing fever and clinical complications (Vinetz, 2003). Ampicillin and doxycycline have also been effective in treating people with leptospirosis.",

            "text": "Leptospirosis in humans is often difficult to diagnose; therefore, the low incidence of reported infection in humans may be misleading. Outbreaks have been documented in the United States from personnel working with laboratory mice (Stoenner and Maclean, 1958, Barkin et al., 1974). In one study, 8 of 58 employees handling infected laboratory mice (80% of breeding females were excreting L. ballum in their urine) contracted leptospirosis (Stoenner and Maclean, 1958). Personnel performing field research may be predisposed to developing leptospirosis and other zoonotic diseases, since occupational exposure to wild animal habitats is a work-related risk factor (Adjemian et al., 2012). Because of the variability in clinical symptoms and lack of pathognomonic findings in humans and animals, serological diagnosis or actual isolation of leptospires is imperative (Bharti et al., 2003, Levett, 2001). As an aid to diagnosis, leptospires can sometimes be observed by examination or direct staining of body fluids or fresh tissue suspensions. The definitive diagnosis in humans or animals is made by culturing the organisms from tissue or fluid samples. Culture media with long-chain fatty acids with 1% bovine serum albumin are routinely used as a detoxicant (Faine, 1991). Serological assessment is accomplished by indirect hemagglutination, agglutination analysis, complement fixation, microscopic agglutination, and fluorescent antibody techniques (Faine, 1991). Growth of the organism is slow, and cultures should be incubated in the dark for 6 weeks at 30\u00b0C (Goldstein, 1991, Collins and Lorber, 2009). The serological test most frequently used is the microscopic agglutination test, which employs dark-field microscopy. Titers of 1:100 or greater are considered significant. When comparing serological assays, ELISA and dot ELISA have the highest sensitivities and specificities (Goldstein, 1991, Collins and Lorber, 2009). PCR-based assays are also available for diagnosis (Smythe et al., 2002). Personnel hygiene and protective garments that minimize exposure to infected urine and other infected animal tissue are important for control of zoonotic infection with leptospires.",

H. cinaedi, a fastidious microaerophile, has been recovered from blood and fecal specimens of children and of a neonate with septicemia and meningitis. The mother of the neonate had cared for pet hamsters during the first two trimesters of her pregnancy (Orlicek et al., 1993). Because H. cinaedi has been isolated from normal intestinal flora of hamsters, it was suggested that the pet hamsters served as a reservoir for transmission to the mother. The mother had a diarrheal illness during the third trimester of pregnancy; the newborn was likely to have been infected during the birthing process, although this was not proven (Orlicek et al., 1993). Furthermore, the hamster has been suggested as possibly infecting other humans with H. cinaedi (Gebhart et al., 1989). Studies are needed to confirm zoonotic risk of handling H. cinaedi-infected hamsters (Gebhart et al., 1989). Also of interest is the isolation, based on cellular fatty acid and biochemical identification, and molecular analysis, of H. cinaedi from the feces of dogs, cats, and nonhuman primates. H. canis has also been isolated from blood of a bacteremic 7 month-old child living with a cat (Prag et al., 2007).",

Use of dark-field microscopy or acridine orange staining of blood culture media, rather than gram staining, increases likelihood of seeing the organism. Likewise, fecal isolation is difficult; selective antibiotic media are required, and recovery is facilitated by passing fecal homogenates through a 0.45-pm filter (Gebhart et al., 1989). In one study, several strains of both H. cinaedi and H. fennelliae were inhibited by concentrations of cephalothin and cetazolin used frequently in selective media for isolation of enteric microaerophilic bacterium. These organisms also require an environment rich in hydrogen for optimum in vitro growth. Until diagnostic laboratories embark on routine isolation attempts of Helicobacter spp. from feces, the extent of their presence in companion and pocket pets and their zoonotic potential will be unknown.",

H. pylori infection is an important cause of human gastritis; however, most epidemiologic studies do not incriminate animal contact as a cause of human infection. An epidemiologic survey conducted in Germany did not show an increased risk of H. pylori because of cat ownership.

            "text": "Although the reported prevalence of Salmonella in laboratory animals has decreased in the past several decades because of management practices (e.g., pasteurizing animal feeds), environmental contamination with Salmonella continues to be a potential source of infection for these animals and for the personnel handling them. Until all animal feeds in the United States and Europe are Salmonella-free and animals are procured from Salmonella-free sources, laboratory animal-associated cases of salmonellosis in humans will continue. The increasing number of recalls due to Salmonella-contaminated, commercially available dog and cat food, presumably manufactured in facilities with improper quality control procedures, is particularly of concern (CDC, 2012c). Endemic salmonellosis in commercially raised guinea pigs as well as dogs, cats, and nonhuman primates has also been a source of infection in personnel working with these animals. Prevalence data from eight studies conducted worldwide indicated that a wide range (0.6\u201327%) of cats were culture positive for Salmonella, and a conservative estimate for the U.S. canine population would be 10%. Rats are extremely susceptible to infection with Salmonella. In studies performed in the 1920s through 1940s, the prevalence of Salmonella in wild rats surveyed in the United States varied from 1% to 18%, compared to 19% in Europe (Geller, 1979, Weisbroth, 1979, Alexander, 1984). In experimental studies, when rats were dosed orally with Salmonella, 10% shed the organism in the 2 months after inoculation, and a few remained carriers when examined 5 months after experimental challenge. These rats, when placed with other naive rats, were capable of initiating new epizootics. Fortunately, the disease in laboratory rats, although common prior to 1939, has been isolated rarely in U.S. commercially reared rats since that time. Birds and reptiles are particularly dangerous sources of Salmonella; as much as 94% of all reptiles harbor Salmonella. (Chiodini and Sundberg, 1981). Turtles have received a great deal of zoonotic attention and in 1970 alone may have caused 280,000 human cases of salmonellosis. In the late 1960s, with annual sales of 15 million turtles, zoonotic salmonellosis became a growing problem. In 1972, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) banned importation of turtles and turtle eggs and the interstate shipment of turtles that were not certified as free of Salmonella or Arizona hinshawii in their state of origin. However, the unreliable effectiveness of this method forced the FDA in 1975 to rule against the sale of viable turtle eggs or live turtles with a carapace length less than 10.2 cm, with exceptions made for educational or scientific institutions and marine turtles. Subsequently, there was a substantial decrease in turtle-associated salmonellosis, indicating the efficacy of this regulation. These restrictions are difficult to enforce, and other reptiles, e.g., iguanas, are increasingly cited in zoonotic outbreaks of salmonellosis, particularly in children. Also of note, because of repeated reports of chick- and duckling-associated salmonellosis, some states have also restricted their sale as pets.",

            "text": "An outbreak of multidrug resistant S. enterica serovar Typhimurium associated with commercially distributed pet rodents, including rats, mice, and hamsters, was recently reported (Swanson et al., 2007). Twenty-eight matching isolates identified by PFGE of S. enterica serotype Typhimurium from humans were identified from humans; 13 (59%) had previously had contact with rodents purchased from retail pet stores and 2 patients (9%) had secondarily acquired the infection from a patient who had been exposed to an infected rodent. These 15 patients whose median age was 16 years (neonate-43) resided in 10 different states. No single source of rodents was common in all cases and each case household had purchased the rodents from a different retail pet store. It was ascertained that several of the rodent breeders and distributors routinely used antimicrobials (e.g., spectinomycin, leptomycin, tetracycline, and nitrofurazone) in the drinking water as a preventative measure for nonspecific rodent enteritis. Interestingly, all human animal and environmental samples of S. enterica serovar Typhimurium isolates tested in this outbreak were uniformly resistant to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, streptomycin, sulfisoxazole, and tetracycline (R-type ACSSuT). Patients infected with multiple antibiotic resistant strains of S. enterica serotype Typhimurium have higher hospitalization rates than patients infected with susceptible strains (Martin, 2004; Varma, 2005). There are also reports of increased risk of septicemia, treatment failure, and mortality associated with multidrug resistant S. enterica serotype Typhimurium (Helms et al., 2002). The spread of these multiple antibiotic resistant strains in rodents may have been facilitated by the widespread use of antibiotics as a prophylactic measure in the pocket pet retail industry. Indeed treatment with oral antibiotics may eliminate normal enterobacteriacae enteric flora and facilitate colonization with antibiotic resistant Salmonella, as observed in mice treated with antimicrobials (Que, 1985; van der Waaij, 1968; van der Waaij et al., 1971. The authors of this outbreak urged heightened disease surveillance in pet retail facilities, as well as increased hygiene and husbandry practices to minimize the need for prophylactic antimicrobial therapy. Individuals purchasing rodents as pets or for food consumption by reptiles should be alerted to the possibility that these animals\u2019 feces are potentially infectious. For example, additional outbreaks of Salmonellosis have been traced to households that have pet snakes. The source of Salmonella infection in humans, particularly children, was caring for the pet snakes that, as part of their diet, were fed Salmonella-infected frozen rats and mice sold commercially in the United States, as well as the United Kingdom (Fuller, 2008, Harker et al., 2011). Aquatic frogs, particularly African dwarf frogs, can also be a source of Salmonella infection (CDC, 2010b; CDC, 2011). This highlights the importance of ascertaining pet status of prospective animal technicians who have applied for positions in vivaria. Another multistate outbreak of S. enterica serovar Typhimurium has been recently reported due to exposure to infected pet hedgehogs (Marsden-Haug et al., 2013). The increased incidence of Salmonella infections can be reduced by hand washing with soap and water after handling of rodents, their cages, and bedding.",

Fat and moisture in food promote survival of Salmonella. Pasteurization of milk and proper cooking of food (56\u00b0C for 10\u201320 min) effectively destroy Salmonella.

Although cattle, birds, and humans are the major reservoir hosts, many animals, including swine, sheep, goats, monkeys, cats, dogs, and ferrets, are susceptible and contribute to the spread of disease (Marini et al., 1989, Fox and Marini, 2014, Swennes and Fox, 2014). This susceptibility varies according to the immune response of the host and to the particular Mycobacterium spp. infecting the host. In nonhuman primates, outbreaks of tuberculosis still occur, particularly in the Old World species of monkeys. They initially contract the disease in the wild through human contact, and then the organism is transmitted from monkey to monkey (Richter et al., 1984).",

Historical classification schemes have speciated Giardia based on host origin, since the recovered cysts are for the most part morphologically indistinguishable. However, based on experimental infections, it is known that cross-species transmission can occur. Considering the cosmopolitan distribution of the parasite in wild and domestic animals, the potential for zoonotic transmission appears significant. When infected beavers were identified in the watersheds associated with human waterborne outbreaks, this circumstantial evidence led to supposition that beavers were the cause (Dykes et al., 1980, Keifer et al., 1980) and resulted in the disease being referred to as \u2018beaver fever.\u2019 Experimental transmission studies showed that cysts from a beaver source can infect dogs as well as human volunteers (Davies et al., 1979). However, further studies comparing the infectious dose of homologous and heterologous isolates determined that host-adapted strains are more readily transmitted, and the significantly higher innolum required for cross-species transmission in some cases is enough to lend some doubt to the likelihood of natural transmission (Erlandsen et al., 1988). Wildlife giardiasis may be a reverse zoonosis whereby human contamination of the environment leads to animal infection (Thompson et al., 2011).

In addition, as the definitive hosts in the T. gondii life cycle, felines develop intestinal infection, with the shedding of oocysts. Thus, the domestic cat is the primary reservoir for the zoonotic transmission of T. gondii in the laboratory environment. The three common modes of transmission are congenital infection, ingestion of T. gondii-infected tissue, and ingestion of toxoplasma oocytes or from direct exposure and consumption of contaminated food or water (Dubey, 1998). Most postnatally acquired infections in cats are asymptomatic and have a variable prepatent period and pattern of oocyst shedding. The prepatent period can be as brief as 3 days if the cat has ingested mice or meat containing T. gondii cysts, or it can be as long as several weeks if oocysts have been ingested. Shedding of oocysts in the feces occurs for 1\u20132 weeks, during which time cats are considered a public health risk (Dubey, 1998). Oocysts become infectious after sporulation, which occurs in 1\u20135 days. Oocysts survive best in warm, moist soil. Oocyst shedding is less likely to occur if the cat was infected by oocysts or tachyzoites than if infection resulted from the ingestion of Toxoplasma cysts. Oocyst shedding can be reactivated by induction of hypercorticism or by superinfection with other feline microorganisms, such as Isospora felis (Chessman, 1972). Oocysts of T. gondii have been observed infrequently in the feces of naturally infected cats (Ladiges et al., 1982), and shedding usually precedes the development of antibody titers to T. gondii. The oocyst is very hardy and can survive freezing and as much as several months of extreme heat and dehydration. Importantly, high IgG titers do not prove recent or active infection (Dubey et al., 1995).",

In addition to sporadic clinical cases, occasional epidemics can occur when humans are exposed to oocyst-contaminated environments (Teutsch et al., 1979). Populations at high risk of infection are pregnant women and immunodeficient individuals. Congenital infection in humans results in systemic disease, frequently with severe neuropathological changes. Postnatal infection results in disease that is less severe and commonly presents as nondescript, consisting of fever, myalgia, and generalized lymphadenopathy that may resolve without treatment in a few weeks. Asymptomatic infection may recrudesce with encephalitis if patients become immunocompromised. Although rare, serious systemic toxoplasmosis can be acquired by older individuals. This is manifested by fever, maculopapular eruption, malaise, myalgia, arthralgia, posterior cervical lymphadenopathy, pneumonia, myocarditis, and meningoencephalitis. Ocular toxoplasmosis, usually chorioretinitis, is commonly seen in postnatal infections but can also occur in infections of older individuals. Clinically severe and progressive illness is most likely to develop in immunocompromised individuals. As high as 10% of AIDS patients have toxoplasmosis (Gill and Stone, 1992). These patients develop neurologic disease and can experience convulsions, paralysis, or coma or even die from toxoplasmosis, even after treatment is administered. Infection in these cases is considered in most cases to be reactivation of tissue cysts from a chronic infection.",

The preferred therapy in humans is pyrimethamine administered in combination with a sulfa drug. Laboratory-acquired infections are likely restricted to the use and handling of laboratory cats (DiGiacomo et al., 1990). Rigorous sanitation should effectively prevent human toxoplasmosis from occurring in the laboratory environment. Since oocysts must sporulate before they are infectious, daily cleaning of litter plans will prevent accumulation of infectious oocysts. Personnel should wear gloves when handling litter pans and wash their hands thoroughly before eating. Pregnant women should completely avoid contact with cat feces. Most cats acquire infection shortly after weaning and shed the oocysts for a short period of time (<3 weeks). Nevertheless, unsporulated oocysts are more susceptible to proper disinfection, and control of exposure should be centered around disinfection of litter pans at this stage.",

In addition, most of these mites are capable of producing severe allergic papular dermatitis in humans (Fox and Reed, 1978, Fox, 1982b) (Fig. 28.11\n). Control of mite infestation is primarily dependent on their habitats. Some, such as Sarcoptes spp. and Notoedres spp., are obligate parasites that require treatment of the host. Other mites, such as Ornithonyssus bacoti, which live most of the time off the animal, require treatment of the environment with appropriate insecticides (Markell et al., 1999; Fox, 2009, Fox, 1982b).",

The brown dog tick, Rhipicephalus sanguineus, is an exception. It readily infests kennels and vivaria. Ticks, like mites, can transmit a variety of diseases, including Rocky Mountain spotted fever, tick-borne typhus, Lyme disease, and others (Table 28.4\n). Lyme borreliosis is a commonly reported tick-borne infection in Europe and North America. The illness is caused by a spirochete, Borrelia burgdorferi, which is transmitted during the blood feeding of ticks of the genus Ixodes. The larvae and nymphs feed readily on a wide range of hosts, including birds, and an abundance of reservoir hosts exists, usually small and medium-sized animals. Larger animals, such as deer, sheep, cows, or horses, must be present for the maintenance of the tick population since adult ticks only engorge successfully on larger animals. Transmission occurs through salivation during the feeding process on a host. Control of ticks indoors is aimed primarily at the resting places of the unattached ticks and proper treatment of newly arrived animals, which are noted for harboring ticks.",

Three rodent fleas, X. cheopis, Nasopsyllus fasciatus, and Leptopsylla segnis, have been found in a high percentage of urban dwellings in certain areas of the United States and are potential transmitters of disease in the laboratory. Apparently, X. cheopis in the past was readily established in animal facilities. At a Midwestern U.S. university, it inhabited rooms housing laboratory mice, where on two separate occasions fleas bit students (Yunker, 1964). L. segnis, the mouse and rat flea, bites humans and is a vector for plague and typhus, serious diseases in humans. L. segnis can also serve as an intermediate host for the rodent tapeworms H. (Rodentolepsis) nana and H. diminuta, both of which can infect humans (Markell et al., 1999). The flea bite can be irritating and can cause allergic dermatitis. The cat flea, Ctenocephalides felis, is the most common flea in and around human dwellings in the United States. This flea is capable of experimentally transmitting plague and murine typhus, and therefore, the potential exists for transmitting the disease to humans. Control of fleas consists of treatment of infested areas as well as the primary host; in the case of rodent fleas, the animal facility must be free of feral rodents and their entry to prevent introduction of these arthropods.\n",
