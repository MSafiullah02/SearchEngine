To date, six different astroviruses have been identi fi ed in avian species based on the species of origin and viral genome characteristics: two turkey-origin astroviruses [Turkey Astrovirus type 1 (TAstV-1) and type 2 (TAstV-2)]; two chicken-origin astroviruses [Avian Nephritis Virus (ANV) and Chicken Astrovirus (CAstV)]; and two duck-origin astrovirus [Duck Astrovirus type 1 (DAstV-1) and type 2 (DAstV-2)]. ANV has also been detected in turkeys, ducklings, pigeons, and guinea fowl; and TAstrovirus-2-like viruses have also been found in guinea fowl. Astroviruses are commonly associated with enteric disease syndromes in poultry including runting-stunting syndrome of broilers (RSS), poult enteritis complex or syndrome (PEC or PES), poult enteritis mortality syndrome (PEMS), and enteritis in guinea fowl. The molecular characterization of the different avian astroviruses shows great genetic variability among each type, and this variability in fl uences the ability to detect these viruses by molecular and serological techniques. In this chapter, we review the different aspects related to avian astroviruses, including molecular biology, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and control.",

            "text": "Avian astroviruses comprise a diverse group of viruses affecting many avian species and causing enteritis, hepatitis, and nephritis. Reports of astroviruses as cause of illness in birds predate that of mammals. In 1965, a fatal hepatitis was described in ducklings [ 2 ] and was eventually shown to be caused by an astrovirus [ 22, 23 ] . Another astrovirus, avian nephritis virus (ANV), was fi rst isolated in 1976 and was associated with growth depression and kidney lesions in young chickens. Initially classi fi ed as an Enterovirus , it was later reclassi fi ed as an astrovirus following the complete sequencing of the viral genome [ 30 ] . To date, six different astroviruses have been identi fi ed in avian species based on the species of origin and viral genome characteristics: two turkey-origin astroviruses [Turkey Astrovirus type 1 (TAstV-1) and type 2 (TAstV-2)]; two chicken-origin astroviruses [ANV and Chicken Astrovirus (CAstV)]; and two duck-origin astrovirus [Duck Astrovirus type1 (DAstV-1) and type 2 (DAstV-2)]. ANV has also been detected in turkeys [ 18, 70 ] , ducklings [ 6 ] , pigeons [ 45, 116 ] , and guinea fowl [ 8 ] ; and TAstV-2-like viruses also have been found in guinea fowl [ 9, 10 ] .",

It is known that ANV and TAstV-2 each comprise at least two serotypes but many more are suspected. Some studies have shown that TAstV-2, ANV, and CAstV display substantial levels of capsid protein sequence variability, possibly indicating that there are numerous serotypes of each virus [ 33, 71, 72, 88, 94, 104 ] . Concomitant infections with different strains have been reported for avian astroviruses and this can result in recombination between strains [ 71, 72, 94, 104 ] . Recombination is likely to provide an important mechanism by which the sequence diversity of avian astroviruses is increased.

The ANV-like genome in which ORF1a and ORF2 are in the same frame and ORF1b is in the +1 reading frame; the TAstV-like genome in which ORF1b and ORF2 are both in the +1 reading frame; and the DAstV-like genome in which each ORF is in a distinct reading frame ( Fig. 9.1 ). In addition to these organizational differences, the TAstV-2-like viruses are the only members of Avastrovirus missing the conserved s2m RNA stem-loop motif [ 44, 94 ] . While not unprecedented, as the bat, rat, and MBL1 astroviruses are missing this motif [ 11, 12 ] , its absence suggests this feature is not essential. The prevalence of the s2m motif among Astroviridae as well as other viruses led Monceyron et al. to propose that it was introduced into an astrovirus progenitor via a recombination event between non-related viruses [ 62 ] . The biological signi fi cance of the loss of s2m or the differences in the organization of the ORFs is unclear, but may re fl ect differences in evolutionary pressures.",

This discrepancy, however, is not unexpected as TAstV-1 has been classi fi ed as a member genogroup I (see Taxonomy) with the ANV-like viruses based on phylogenetic comparisons of the capsid genes [ 6 ] . The one non-ANV-like CAstV isolate included in this alignment, however, was found to group between genogroups I and II.

Diagrams represent the three basic organizations of the avian astrovirus genomes, and list the speci fi c length of each feature of the fully characterized avian astrovirus isolates. The numbers presented for ORF1a and ORF2 are the nucleotide positions of the start and stop codons. The numbers presented for ORF1a are the nucleotides from the beginning of the \"slippery sequence\" (AAAAAAC) to the ORF1a stop codon the context of its predicted secondary structure ( Fig. 9 .3b ). The conserved stemloop structure has been proposed to function as a promoter element for RNA transcription [ 38, 107 ] . This idea is supported by the fact that a similar highly conserved sequence can be found immediately upstream of ORF2 in the area where RNA transcription of the subgenomic message would begin ( Fig. 9 .3c ). The function of these elements has not been demonstrated experimentally in any astrovirus isolate; however, given their conservation within the genome as well as across Astroviridae this suggests a functional role.",

            "text": "The formation of another RNA structural element, the retrovirus-like frame shift stem-loop, has been a de fi ning characteristic of Astroviridae [ 32 ] . The presence or absence of this structure, along with the other basic genomic organization, has been one of the items used in the classi fi cation of novel viruses to the family [ 20, 30, 39, 44 ] . The stem-loop formed has been described to play a key role in the translation of the ORF1b as part of the ORF1a polyprotein in human astrovirus infected cells avastroviruses were aligned using ClustalW2, and the phylogeny estimated neighbor using the neighbor joining method and 1,000 bootstrap replicates were calculated. The viruses that have been assigned to one of the two genogroups have been highlighted (genogroup I = brown , genogroup II = blue ) [48] [49] [50] 55 ] . Experimental evidence demonstrated that the stem-loop formed allowed for a frame shift to occur upstream of the ORF1a stop-codon, and that brought ORF1b into frame with ORF1a resulting in the translation of one polyprotein [ 21, 49 ] . Based on this observation, it has been assumed that the presence of this structure in Avastrovirus genomes meant a similar mechanism allowed for the translation of the avian astrovirus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). Recently, studies by Kang et al. have suggested that the avian astroviruses may not use this strategy [ 39 ] . Comparison of the stem-loop predicted for human astrovirus to that of the avian viruses demonstrates differences in their ability to induce the needed frame shift (Fig. 9.4 ) . In human astrovirus, the loop structure is between the \"slippery sequence\" (AAAAAAC) and the ORF1a stop codon ( Fig. 9.4 ) . Conversely, in the avian astroviruses, the ORF1a stop codon is immediately downstream of the \"slippery sequence,\" and upstream of the stem loop structure ( Fig. 9.4 ) . Therefore, any frame shift induced may not allow for translation of ORF1a to read through to ORF1b. Kang et al. proposed that translation of ORF1b in the CAstV could initiate via a start codon just upstream of the \"slippery sequence\" [ 39 ] ; however, this is the only avian virus to have a start site immediately upstream of the \"slippery sequence\" and would require the stem-loop structure not to be formed. Examination of these viruses for other alternative start sites revealed the fi rst ATG in ORF1b was between 68 and 257 nt downstream from the ORF1a stop codon ( Fig. 9.4 ). It is possible that a more complex stem-loop and frame shift structure is produced in these viruses that For each genome, the predicted structure formed from a 65 nt region starting 10 nt upstream of the slippery sequence (AAAAAAC, highlighted by dashed box ). The ORF1a stop codon is highlighted by a solid box , and potential start codons in the ORF1b frame are underlined allows for the translation of ORF1a-1b or, as proposed by Kang et al., perhaps the avian astroviruses use a different strategy for the translation of their RdRp [ 39 ] .",

It is unclear how this capsid precursor protein is processed to result in mature capsid subunit proteins, or how the subunits then assemble into intact virions, but it is largely assumed that similar to the human astroviruses, the precursor is cleaved by trypsin-like proteases to produce 2-3 capsid subunits ranging in size from 25 to 34 kDa [ 7 ] .

Comparisons among the capsid sequences of avastroviruses and mamastroviruses, as well as within avastroviruses, indicate that all of the astrovirus capsid sequences have essentially three main domains ( Fig. 9 .5 ). The N-terminal end of the capsid protein is rich in basic amino acids; 23-35 of the fi rst 100 residues are basic, primarily lysine or arginine. The numbers of basic residues is higher among TAstV-2, DAstV, and CAstV isolates, which have 32-35 positive residues, and contain a conserved SRSRSRSRSRSR motif. The TAstV-1 and ANV isolates have 23-25 positive residues but do not have the SR repeat region. Highly basic N-terminal regions have been demonstrated to play a key role in the encapsidation of viral RNAs for several viruses, and therefore it is assumed that these residues play a similar role in astroviruses [ 46 ] .",

            "text": "Analysis of the rest of the avian astrovirus capsid protein demonstrates, as previously described for human astroviruses, the N-terminal half of the protein is far more conserved than the C-terminal half ( Fig. 9 .5 ). Analysis of the human astroviruses indicate that the more conserved region of the capsid is important in virion assembly while the more variable region is found on the outer surface of the virion and is involved in interacting with cellular receptors and the immune system [ 46 ] . This suggests that these different regions of the capsid protein are under different evolutionary pressures. The fi rst approximately 400 residues are important for encapsidation of the viral RNA and formation of the virion. As such, there are strong structural constraints to the sequence and therefore potential selection against amino acid substitutions. Conversely, the last approximately 300 residues would be exposed to antibodies produced by the host as well as binding to potential new host cells. Especially in the context of interspecies transmission, which appears to occur with some regularity among the avian astroviruses (see \"Epidemiology\" and \"Pathogenesis\" sections), one could imagine considerable evolutionary pressure driving amino acid changes in this region. Studies by Strain et al. support this idea [ 94 ] . Strain et al. identi fi ed 12 codons within the TAstV-2 capsid with evidence of positive selection. Among these 12 codons, 10 were located in the C-terminal half. Additional studies are required to better understand the roles each of these regions play in the life cycle of avian astroviruses and speci fi cally how these different roles affect their evolution. Krishna (2005) , are represented by the blue bar and is superimposed on percent similarity plot demonstrating the level of amino acid homology across 34 avastrovirus capsid sequences (see Fig. 9 .5 ). The similarity plot was constructed using Vector NTI 10.0.1 and using a 25 amino acid window Taxonomy Currently, avastrovirus species are based on the hosts from which they were isolated [ 7 ] ; however, at present the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) only recognizes three species within the genus: Chicken astroviruses (ANV-1, ANV-2, ANV-3), Duck astrovirus (DAstV-C-NGB), and Turkey astrovirus (TAstV-1). As such, the species do not correspond to genetic phylogenies (Figs. 9.2 and 9.6 ), and all the other related viruses are considered members of the genus but have not been approved as species. To address these issues, the classi fi cation of avastrovirus species is currently being rede fi ned based on the complete amino acid sequence of the capsid protein. Based on this analysis, the avian astroviruses can be divided into two main genogroups: genogroup I and genogroup II ( Fig. 9.6 ).",

In general, all of the isolates are from a particular type of cluster in distinct clades, and these clades largely correspond with the species the viruses were isolated from. The one major exception is the TAstV-1 isolate, which is found more similar to the ANV viruses (Figs. 9.2 and 9.6 ). However, more careful inspection of the branch order of the TAstV-2 isolates between Figs. 9.2 and 9.6 demonstrates potentially important differences. Most notably, in Fig. 9 .6 the CO/2001 and MI/2001 isolates are on the same branch; however, in Fig. 9 .2 they were found to be more divergent. This discrepancy is due to a potential recombination event which occurred between these two viruses at the beginning of ORF2 [ 94 ] . This results in two isolates which appear to be identical based on the capsid analysis, but, in fact, are more divergent, and suggests analysis of the capsid region in most cases may be suf fi cient to assign an individual isolate to a particular group; understanding how that isolate may be related to others within that group requires more extensive comparisons.",

The viruses that have been assigned to one of the two genogroups have been highlighted (genogroup I = brown , genogroup II = blue ). Isolates in bold denote those with full genomic sequence represented in Fig. 9 .2 . The mean amino acid genetic distance (p-dist) \u00b1 standard deviation for each of the major clades was calculated using MEGA5 based on the use of virus-speci fi c RT-PCR tests. Using indirect immuno fl uorescence (IF) performed with the reference ANV-1 virus (G-4260), investigations in the 1980s and 1990s have shown that ANV infections are highly prevalent in commercial chickens in Japan and in several European countries [ 13, 31 ] . Antibody to ANV was also detected in turkey fl ocks and in SPF fl ocks [ 13, 58 ] . More recently, application of two indirect IF tests developed to separately detect antibodies to two antigenically different CAstVs demonstrated that infections with both CAstV antigenic groups were very common in UK broilers and in broiler parent fl ocks. Antibodies to both were also detected in parent fl ocks from many European countries, and were also detected in some UK turkeys [ 105 ] . Using a recently developed serological test for DAstV-1, it was found that 63.2% and 51% sera samples from two commercial fl ocks of ducks that survived DAstV-1 were positive for DAstV [ 108 ] . Interestingly, DAstV-speci fi c antibodies were also detected in 28.6% of 42 sera samples from a healthy fl ock, indicating a wide distribution of subclinical infections caused by DAstV [ 108 ] . To our knowledge, seroprevalence studies have not been reported for the TAstVs.",

The virus was later de fi nitively identi fi ed as an astrovirus [ 102 ] and completely sequenced [ 20 ] . Duck hepatitis virus 3 (DHV-3), fi rst reported by Toth in 1969 [ 106 ] and characterized by Haider and Calnek in 1979 [ 24 ] , was recently identi fi ed by sequencing as a second astrovirus in ducks (DAstV-2) [ 102 ] .",

Deaths occur within 1-4 days, usually within 1-2 h after the appearance of clinical signs, which include polydypsia with loose droppings, excessive urate excretion, and sometimes convulsions and acute opisthotonos. Affected ducks usually die in good condition and both the mean death time and the mortality rate (10-50%) depend on the age of the ducks [ 22 ] . Survivors excrete virus for at least 1 week after infection and rear normally, with little evidence of retarded growth. The target organs for DAstV-1 appear to be liver and kidneys. The liver is usually pale pink with hemorrhages, and the kidneys are often swollen. Microscopic changes are characterized by extensive necrosis of hepatocytes and bile duct hyperplasia [ 22 ] . DAstV-2 has a low pathogenicity for ducklings experimentally infected, and only ducklings appear to be infected by the virus. Mortality rarely exceeds 30% [ 109 ] and mature ducks are refractory to the disease [ 22 ] .",

TAstV-2 infection results in overall growth depression of infected birds. Common lesions observed at necropsy are dehydration, distended intestines fi lled with watery contents and undigested feed, and dilated ceca with foamy contents. Microscopic lesions present in the intestines consist of mild crypt hyperplasia, mild villous atrophy, and mild lymphocytic in fi ltration, and were most common in the jejunum [ 5, 41, 68 ] . Presence of the viruses has been demonstrated by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and by in situ hybridization (ISH) in both villi and crypt enterocytes in the duodenum, jejunum, ileum, and ceca ( Fig. 9.7 ) [ 5, 41, 59, 66, 68 ] . Mild lymphocytic in fi ltration was also observed in other organs including pancreas, liver, spleen, and kidneys. Viremia occurred after infection with TAstV-2 [ 41, 68 ] ; however, only intestinal cells appear to support viral replication. The possibility exists that low levels of viral replication may occur in other tissues and may not be detected with the tests used which would explain the extra-intestinal lesions observed.",

ANV typically causes histological changes in the kidneys although the viral antigen can be detected in other organs including liver, spleen, pancreas, jejunum, and rectum [ 27, 29, 84, 86 ] . Young chicks are the most susceptible and become resistant to disease after the fi rst month of life [ 28 ] . ANV infections in chicks can vary from subclinical to outbreaks of runting stunting syndrome (RSS) and nephropathy [ 19, 31, 86, 95, 96, 110 ] . However, the role of ANV infection on RSS is not clear. Although ANV affected body gain in SPF chicks [ 85 ] , an experimental study on the effect of ANV and several unclassi fi ed enteroviruslike viruses (ELVs) in commercial chicks demonstrated that only one ELV, later also characterized as an ANV, analyzed among the broad panel produced clinical signs in inoculated chicks [ 57 ] . Similarly, infection of 1-day-of-age chicks with ELVs, which were later identi fi ed as the FP3 and 612 isolates of CAstV and an ANV, showed that the ELVs are able to induce more severe lesions in the intestine, the kidneys, and the pancreas than the G-4260 strain of ANV [ 89 ] . Passive and active surveys indicate that ANV is widely distributed worldwide and that serological evidence can be found in turkeys as well [ 13, 16, 58, 65, 95 ] . Although an ANV genetically related to ANV-1 was detected in the feces of turkeys [ 70, 72 ] , to date the infection has never been associated with the disease in turkeys. An attempt to infect poults with the chicken-derived ANV-1 strain was unsuccessful [ 61 ] .",

One of these isolates, isolate 19, induced diarrhea and runting and stunting in 3-week-old SPF layer chickens; however, the clinical tenosynovitis, which was seen regularly in the broilers and poults from the fi eld, was not seen in the experimentally infected layers [ 15 ] . The isolation of these new avian astrovirus strains from chickens and turkeys with acute tenosynovitis and arthritis without the isolation of any other detectable pathogen suggests that they also might play a role in leg disorders. The pathogenicity of this virus was further demonstrated by the mortality and histopathological fi ndings and seems to be broader than is reported for ANV-1 [ 15 ] . Many studies have shown that the pathogenicity of ANV-1 is limited to the kidney of chickens, in contrast to the damage observed in the kidney, pancreas, duodenum, thymus, bursa, and liver seen after infection with this new ANV [ 15 ] . Other ANVs have been shown to vary in pathogenicity and tropism. A Belgian PV2 isolate, originally recognized as an ELV, was shown to cause substantial growth retardation, and severe and long-lasting intestinal lesions following experimental infection [ 17 ] . Lesions were detected in the pancreas and proventriculus and were absent in the kidneys from chickens experimentally infected with PV2, suggesting that some ANV isolates such as PV2 may have different tissue tropisms [ 17 ] .",

These changes were associated with decreased apical expression of the sodium/hydrogen exchanger 3 (NHE3) with a concomitant decrease in sodium absorption [ 66 ] .

Studies by Qureshi et al. and Koci et al. have both demonstrated that macrophages and adherent splenocytes from TAstV-2-infected poults produce more nitric oxide (NO) following ex vivo stimulation with lipopolysccharide than do cells from uninfected controls [ 40, 73 ] . NO has long been recognized as a potent anti-viral effector molecule; however, histological examination of TAstV-2 infected poults does not demonstrate large in fl uxes of macrophages or other innate immune cells. To determine if NO could play a role in the regulation of TAstV-2 replication, the virus was exposed to NO donor compounds in vitro prior to inoculating embryos, and found to inactivate the virus [ 40 ] . Conversely, when embryos were pretreated with an inhibitor of the inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) enzyme virus replication increased signi fi cantly [ 40, 51 ] . Finally, to determine if TAstV-2-infected intestines demonstrated an increase in the expression of iNOS, tissues from TAstV-2-infected turkey poults were stained for the presence of TAstV-2 antigen and turkey iNOS. These experiments demonstrated an increase in iNOS expression following TAstV-2 infection, with the majority of the staining localized to the intestinal epithelium suggesting that in the absence of a response from either innate or adaptive immune cells the intestine is capable of mounting its own innate defense [ 59 ] .",

            "text": "The detection of clinical signs, gross pathological fi ndings, and histological lesions is required before disease can be diagnosed. However, in the case of astroviruses, these in themselves may not be suf fi cient to identify the causal virus. For example, hepatitis in ducklings may be caused by one of the two different astroviruses: DAstV-1 and DAstV-2, originally known as duck hepatitis virus types 2 and 3, or the picornavirus, originally known as duck hepatitis virus type 1 [ 109 ] . Similarly, histological lesions consistent with nephritis in chickens can be caused by ANV, infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), and CAstV (Todd et al., unpublished results) . In cases of hepatitis and nephritis, the presence of a speci fi c astrovirus needs to be demonstrated in the affected tissue, preferably at the site of the histological lesion. This can be achieved using immunohistochemistry (IHC), undertaken with paraf fi n-embedded formalin-fi xed tissue, or immuno fl uorescence (IF) performed with frozen tissue or tissue impression smears. However, due to the limited availability of avian astrovirus-speci fi c antibodies, to date these methods have received limited application. IF is used to diagnose hepatitis in ducklings caused by DAstV-2 [ 24 ] . Very recently, a prototype immunoperoxidase-based IHC method has been applied to demonstrate the presence of CAstV antigen in nephritis-associated histological lesions (Todd et al., unpublished results; Fig. 9 .8 ). This work suggested that CAstV alone was capable of causing nephritis in chickens and highlighted the need to identify the virus responsible in cases of nephritis and visceral gout. Imada et al. has reported that IF is a useful diagnostic procedure for ANV, detecting the group antigens and staining infected kidneys during the early acute phase of the disease [ 26 ] . In situ hybridization (ISH) can also be used to detect the presence of viral nucleic acid at the site of the histological lesion. Because probes generated from cloned virus-speci fi c cDNA fragments may be more easily produced than virus-speci fi c antibodies, ISH may prove to be an easier approach to develop. ISH has been used to demonstrate the presence of TAstV-2 RNA within the enterocytes present on the sides of the villi from virus-infected turkeys, but its use to detect other avian astroviruses has not yet been reported [ 5, 41, 68 ] .",

However, astrovirus diagnosis by EM has a number of drawbacks, the most important being that some avian astroviruses fail to display the characteristic star morphology. This appears to be the case for ANV, DAstV-2, and CAstV, which are detected as small spherical viruses without obvious surface structure, and, on this basis, these were originally considered to be picornaviruses (ANV) or enterovirus-like viruses (CAstV, DAstV-2) [ 57 ] . Additional drawbacks of EM include its relative lack of sensitivity, and its unsuitability for the testing of large samples due to the time, labor, and equipment required.",

TAstV and DAstV can be propagated in turkey and duck embryos, respectively, and sometimes in chick embryos as well [ 98, 109 ] . Although the propagation of DAstV-1 (formerly DHV-2) in cell culture has been reported [ 4 ] , the propagation of TAstV in cell cultures has not. The growth of high yields of TAstV isolates in turkey embryos has facilitated the production of puri fi ed virus, with which virus-speci fi c antibodies have been prepared [ 97 ] . The astroviruses from chickens can be propagated in chicken embryos and in cell culture. CAstVs can be propagated in SPF chick embryos following yolk sac inoculation to produce variable effects including early embryo death, dwar fi ng, hemorrhages, edema, and feather changes [ 91 ] . ANVs can be propagated in SPF embryos following egg inoculation using a variety of routes. Isolation of ANV in cell cultures has been reported in a number of studies [ 19, 25, 110 ] , and induces a cell rounding CPE in primary chicken kidney cells typically within 72 h post infection [ 26 ] . Experience from some laboratories suggests that some ANVs may be non-cultivable and the inconsistent growth of some ANVs in primary cell culture and embryos has prompted speculation that embryos containing ANV antibody may inhibit in vitro propagation (Todd et al. unpublished results) . Baxendale and Mebatsion have reported the isolation and propagation of CAstVs in primary chick embryo liver cells and LMH cells, in which plaques similar to those produced by DAstV (DHV-2) were obtained [ 4 ] . The CAstV isolates have been used in virus neutralization tests, with which antibody to CAstV was detected [ 4 ] . There is also evidence that CAstVs can non-productively infect when inoculated into primary chick embryo liver cells [ 105 ] . In these cases, the inoculated CAstV undergoes partial replication, producing virus proteins that can be detected by indirect IF without producing infectious virus and CPE [ 105 ] . The effects produced by particular avian astroviruses in cell culture or in experimentally inoculated embryos are relatively nonspeci fi c and cannot easily be distinguished from the effects caused by other avian astroviruses or other viruses. As such, the cultured virus needs to be identi fi ed; this can be accomplished through the detection of virus-speci fi c antigens or nucleic acid. Although cultivable virus isolates are essential for biological characterization and pathogenesis studies, virus isolation is not routinely used to detect avian astroviruses, the principal reason being that astrovirus-containing samples are frequently contaminated with viruses such as adenoviruses or reoviruses, which replicate faster than the astroviruses in cell culture and/or in embryos. In addition, virus isolation and identi fi cation is time-consuming and labor-intensive, making it unsuitable for testing large samples.",

            "text": "Attention has focused increasingly on the use of molecular diagnostic tests for detecting avian astroviruses. Since the fi rst report describing an RT-PCR test for detecting TAstV [ 43 ] , conventional and/or real-time tests have been described for ANV [ 14, 54, 103 ] , CAstV [ 70 ] ; [ 89 ] , and DAstV [ 6 ] as well as TAstV-1 and TAstV-2 [ 14, 41, 93, 97 ] . The primers for these tests are usually located in the genomic regions encoding nonstructural proteins such as the RNA polymerase (ORF 1b), which are more conserved than the capsid protein encoding region (ORF 2). However, the high levels of sequence diversity displayed by avian astroviruses species make it dif fi cult to select primers that will detect all variants within one type. Therefore, primer design should be based on comparing sequences from as large a number of virus variants as possible and the need to incorporate degenerate primers recognized. The importance of primer selection was highlighted when it was shown that the RT-PCR test using primers located in the 3 \u00a2 untranslated region (3 \u00a2 UTR) was more successful in detecting ANV-positive samples than tests based on primers located in the nonstructural protease or RNA polymerase [ 89, 103 ] . Similarly, CAstV from all genetic groupings was detected by the conventional and real-time RT-PCR tests described by Smyth et al. [ 88, 89 ] , whereas one CAstV grouping was not detected by another published test [ 14 ] . Applications of these molecular tests have demonstrated that TAstV, ANV, and CAstV are highly prevalent in samples from their respective hosts, and there is a strong likelihood that the vast majority of commercial chicken and turkey fl ocks will become infected at some point in their lifetimes [ 18, 69, 70, 89 ] . Therefore, since all enteric samples are likely to be positive using these highly sensitive RT-PCR methods, knowing that an enteric sample is astrovirus positive is of questionable importance. However, with regard to the impact that the infection may be having on the fl ock or bird, there may be considerably more value in knowing the amounts of virus present, and in knowing whether internal tissues such as the kidney or liver are virus positive.",

A major reason for this is the limited number of avian astrovirus strains that have been adapted to cell culture. Although a number of ANV isolates can be propagated in cell culture, with very few exceptions cell culture isolations of CAstVs, TAstVs, and DAstVs have not been described. The lack of cell culture methods limits the development of indirect IF assays and virus neutralization tests to analyze chicken, turkey, and duck sera for antibodies. Additionally, the development of other serological assays such as ELISAs requires the ability to produce ample quantities of virus and virus antigen. With limited cell culture propagation methods, only a few laboratories have developed these assays for understanding astrovirus serology. An ELISA for detecting ANV antibody was described by Decaesstecker and Meulemans [ 16 ] . Sellers et al. have reported the use of an ELISA for detecting antibodies to CAstV using recombinantly expressed capsid protein [ 83 ] . Wang et al. [ 108 ] and Zhao et al.

[ 85 ] have demonstrated that ANV strains representing serotype 1 (ANV-1) and serotype 2 (ANV-2) exhibit very low levels of cross-reactive antibodies using indirect IF. Todd et al. [ 104 ] have recently reported the common occurrence of ANV variants, which displayed very different capsid protein sequences from those of ANV-1 and ANV-2, and which, on this basis, are likely to be antigenically different. This view is supported by a recent work by de Wit et al. [ 16 ] , who showed that serum samples containing antibodies to a novel ANV isolate (isolate 19) were not detected by an ANV-1 speci fi c indirect IF assay. It is recognized that the CAstVs can be subdivided into two major antigenic groups, designated A and B, which display relatively low levels of cross-reactivity by indirect IF [ 90, 105 ] . For this reason, a recent CAstV seroprevalence study involved the application of two separate indirect IF tests, one based on isolate 612 for detecting antibodies to the CAstVs from Group A, and the second based on isolate 11672 for detecting antibodies to the Group B CAstVs [ 105 ] . Therefore, the antigenic diversities exhibited by ANV and CAstV need to be considered in relation to their serological diagnosis. Serological tests based on the use of single ANV or CAstV strains will not detect antibodies to all ANV or CAstV infections. This is of particular importance when testing SPF fl ocks to demonstrate freedom from infection.",

In addition, astroviruses are very stable in the environment and resistant to inactivation by most routinely used disinfectants, which complicates its elimination from infected premises [ 82 ] . Strict biosecurity, increased down time between fl ocks, and effective disinfection of the premises would help reduce the likelihood of contracting avian astrovirus infections.",

Although experimental live attenuated vaccines were also developed for these astroviruses, these were not commercially produced [ 109 ] . Similarly, commercial vaccines have not been developed for ANV, CAstV, and TAstVs. In the case of ANV and CAstV, which are known to be vertically transmitted, vaccine protocols focused on the parent fl ocks during rear should be considered as a method to prevent or limit transmission to progeny in ovo. In addition, breeder vaccination should ensure uniformly higher levels of maternal antibody, which would better equip the young birds to withstand early viral challenges. The development of live attenuated or inactivated avian astrovirus vaccines will both depend on the availability of cell or embryo culture methods. Alternatively, recombinant expression systems, such as recombinant baculovirus system, might be used to produce astrovirus capsid subunit vaccines. Sellers et al. [ 83 ] recently described the production of a prototype recombinant baculovirus-derived CAstV vaccine, which, following multiple administrations to breeders, offered some protection to progeny chicks against experimentally induced RSS.",

A major reason for this has been the absence in most cases of cell culture growth systems, with which viruses can be isolated and biologically characterized; however, the level of genetic diversity, species affected, and permutations of clinical diseases caused by the various members of Astroviridae complicate our ability to develop a cohesive narrative as other avian viruses. In spite of these challenges, within the last decade, considerable advances have been made. The different avian astroviruses are second only to the human astroviruses in terms of their level of characterization, and in many cases, such a pathogenic mechanism and immunity are the best characterized. Regardless, considerably more research is needed.",

As avian virology laboratories continue to develop new detection methods, and identify and characterize novel avian astroviruses in commercial poultry as well as wild bird species, a more consistent method of comparing (molecularly or antigenically) would aid in our ability to understand the relationship of viruses within the genera as well as identifying potential virulence determinants. As part of this effort to better understand avian astroviruses, the avian virology community should be encouraged to more fully characterize representative members of each genotype, serotype, and subgroup. This would include not only sequencing, but also the development of antibodies and other reagents. Together these efforts would all be in support of increasing our understanding of the cellular, physiological, and immunological changes astroviruses induce in their various host species so that we can develop more effective prevention, control, and therapeutic strategies.",
