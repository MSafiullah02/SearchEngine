Actors and stakeholders need economic, effective and efficient simulations in order to predict and evaluate the impact of development on the environment and the constraints that the environment imposes on development. Numerical simulation models are usually computation expensive and require expert knowledge. We consider the problem of hydrological modelling and simulation. With a training set consisting of pairs of inputs and outputs from an off-the-shelves simulator, We show that a neural network can learn a surrogate model effectively and efficiently and thus can be used as a surrogate simulation model. Moreover, we argue that the neural network model, although trained on some example terrains, is generally capable of simulating terrains of different sizes and spatial characteristics.",

It involves nonlinear, time-varying interactions between rain, topography, soil types and other components associated with the physical process. Several physics-based hydrological numerical simulation models, such as HEC-RAS [26] , LISFLOOD [32] , LISFLOOD-FP [6] , are commonly used to simulate floods.

These models can be classified into one-dimensional (1D), two-dimensional (2D) and threedimensional (3D) models depending on the spatial representation of the flow. The 1D models treat the flow as one-dimension along the river and solve 1D Saint-Venant equations, such as HEC-RAS [1] and SWMM [25] . The 2D models receive the most attention and are perhaps the most widely used models for flood [28] . These models solve different approximations of 2D Saint-Venant equations. Two-dimensional models such as HEC-RAS 2D [9] is implemented for simulating the flood in Assiut plateau in southwestern Egypt [12] and Bolivian Amazonia [23] . Another 2D flow models called LISFLOOD-FP solve dynamic wave model by neglecting the advection term and reduce the computation complexity [7] . The 3D models are more complex and mostly unnecessary as 2D models are adequate [28] . Therefore, we focus our work on 2D flow models.",

The output is the corresponding 3 \u00d7 3 water level at the next time step t + 1. The pixels at the boundary have different hydrological dynamic processes. Therefore, we pad both the water level and DEM with zero values. We expect that the neural network model learns the different hydrological dynamic processes at boundaries. One advantage of our proposed architecture is that the neural network is not restricted by the input size of the terrain for both training and testing.

In Table 2b , for global performance, the MAPE of Case 5 is around 50% less than both Case 3 and Case 4, and for local performance, the MAPE of Case 5 is 34.45%. Similarly, without retraining the existed model, the trained neural network from Case 2 can be applied directly on DEM with different size with a good global performance.",

Furthermore, for a 128 \u00d7 128 DEM, Landlab takes 110 more time than the neural network model. Though the training of the neural network model is time consuming, it can be reused without further training or tuning terrains of different sizes and spatial characteristics.

Moreover, it is able to simulate floods on terrains of different sizes and spatial characteristics not directly represented in the training. We are currently extending our work to take into account other meaningful environmental elements such as the land coverage, geology and weather. ",

We measure the global MSE and the global MAPE both at each time step and their mean for all time steps. From the hydrological point of view, some areas are more important for observation and model calibration. For instance, the exit point of river or a watershed exit. Therefore, we propose two local measurements metrics at the watershed exit: local mean squared error: local M SE = 1 steps t [P t \u2212 T t ] 2 , local mean absolute percentage error: local M AP E = 1 steps t | Pt\u2212Tt Tt |, where P t , T t are the means of predicted and ground truth water level of pixels near watershed exit at t-th time step.

In this section, we show the results of our neural network model on the case of the Lower Onkaparinga river (Case 3 and Case 4). For global performance, the mean of MSE and MAPE in Case 4 is lower than in Case 3, while the variance is higher in Case 4 than in Case 3 according toTable 2b. For local performance, Case 3 is better than Case 4 in all metrics according toTable 2b. Thus, without retraining the existing model, the trained neural network from Case 2 can be applied directly on new DEM with a good global performance.",
