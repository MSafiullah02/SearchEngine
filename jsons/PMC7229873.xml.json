The surgeries were classified by technical difficulty, general complexity and the level of risk. Most surgeries were defined to be of mild (level-2) or moderate (level-3) risks. All patients suffered postoperatively from COVID-19 pneumonia, commonly complicated by ARDS, shock, secondary infection, cardiological complications and acute kidney injury. 15 patients (44.1%) required ICU admission due to MOF or mechanical ventilation. Most of these patients underwent level-3 surgeries, while non-ICU patients were mostly after surgeries of milder risk and shorter duration. In addition, ICU patients were significantly older (55 years vs. 47 years) and more probable to have an underlying comorbidity. Seven patients (20.6%) eventually died due to progressive respiratory failure, all during the postoperative period of level-3 surgeries, all with at least one underlying comorbidity. As patients developed COVID-19 symptoms after an average of 2.6 days, the authors deduce that the elective surgery was performed during the asymptomatic incubation period of COVID-19 and that surgery may accelerate and exacerbate COVID-19 disease.",
