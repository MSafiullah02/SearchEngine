To this end, we present a complete system model and derive an end-to-end mathematical model for the transmission channel under certain constraints and boundary conditions. We derive the system response for both continuous sources such as breathing and jet or impulsive sources such as coughing and sneezing. In addition to transmitter and channel, we assumed a receiver architecture composed of air sampler and Silicon Nanowire field-effect transistor. Then, we formulate a detection problem to maximize the likelihood decision rule and minimize the corresponding missed detection probability. Finally, we present several numerical results to observe the impact of parameters that affect the performance and justify the feasibility of the proposed setup in related applications.",

Although this phenomenon is a naturally existing communication mechanism in most living beings, it is only recently that it gained attention in the research community. This interest is attributed to the recent advancements in nanotechnology and the advent of nanoscale biosensors or nanomachines that have given a boost to research in this field [1] . The existing nanomachines are constrained in their capabilities due to their small size, limited energy resources, memory and processing capacity. Thus, in order to perform complex operations, multiple nanomachines need to cooperate together and this is where the concept of MC plays an essential role. Since links between nanomachines can not be established through existing electromagnetic or optical technology, MC provides this connection that allows them to form a cooperating network of nanomachines [2] . Research in this domain also paves way for development of artificial networks that can imitate biological networks inside or outside the human body. This will not only help in understanding the working mechanism of complex biological systems such as brain, but also help provide cure for several diseases and disorders that occur due to communication links' malfunction inside the body. [3] . Thus, it is envisioned that these advancements can play a vital role in biomedical, environmental and manufacturing applications [1] . Some recently explored biomedical applications include neural network modeling, development of ICT-inspired treatments [3] and intelligent drug delivery [4] .",

It must be noted that the existing solutions for conventional communication can not be simply replicated to MC setups due to the complex nature of the process. The challenges in MC appear in the form of non-stationary signal-dependent noise, range limitations that allow nanomachines to communicate over distances not more than few micrometers, large propagation delays, issues concerning chemical reactivity of molecules resulting in high loss rate, limited memory, power constraints and compatibility between bio-nanomachines [1] . These challenges significantly define the current and future research directions in this area. Furthermore, the fact that these nano-sized sensing bodies allow interaction with biological entities such as bacteria have also opened several new research avenues. For instance, instead of artificially produced molecules and chemicals, chemicals produced by bacteria serve as messenger for communication between bacterial colonies where receptor bacteria produces light in response to received molecules [6] . In addition to micro and macrolevel applications, researchers have also put efforts in understanding and replicating the existing biological processes/systems and interfacing with them.",

Unlike the traditional research in MC, for this particular context the message-bearing entities can not be modulated and the message can not be embedded as desired. However, we believe that the virus-laden exhaled air from an infected person can serve as a source of useful information and we need to design our receiver in order to retrieve this information.

However, since MC receivers inherently integrate the biosensors in their functionality, MC receivers are much more extensive and robust in their applications. The biosensors are limited to detection of a particular entity only and do not go beyond to extract the information encoded in them in the form of concentration, type, etc. as is the case with MC receivers. MC receivers aim to quantify the information extracted by the biosensor and process them in such a way that information beyond the binary detection can be derived. In addition, there are issues related to the scalability of biosensor-based detection systems especially in macro-scale MC applications such as the one proposed in this work. In general, the research on deployment of biosensors in medicine and virology is limited to laboratory-scale systems. The huge differences between laboratory environment and real-life outdoor environments resulting from physical factors such as presence of wind, infrastructure, etc. discourage the deployment of such biosensors in disease monitoring applications without further exploration and study. Thus, it is very essential that the sensing technology should be complemented with data analysis and processing based on physical domain knowledge. In this work, we not only deal with the aspect of information extraction but also incorporate the effect of scalability to real-life environments by modeling the dynamics of physical aerosol channel.",

For modeling the input signal, the duration of experiment or temporal characteristics of the application under consideration are extremely important. For some applications such as understanding the dynamics of diseases spread or detection in specific frameworks where only one person enters the room and stays for long enough, the steady state response of the system is sufficient. However, for applications where decisions are made based on data collected at fine-grained resolution, the transient response is required. Since, the latter yields the system impulse response, we start with transient analysis for jet sources in the next section extending it to the transient analysis for breathing and finally moving to the steady state response for breathing.

The virus is detected with the help of antibody receptors that are placed on the Si-NW as shown on Fig. 5 . When the FET is placed in an antigen-rich solution, the antigens come into contact with the antibody receptors and a binding event takes place. The binding events effect the source-drain conductance channel resulting in accumulation or depletion of electrons just like gate voltage. Thus, the binding events are translated to current change across the source-drain channels by producing a change in the FET conductance. The inherent amplification property of FETs allows for even small number of binding events to produce measurable current making it a highly sensitive sensor [34] - [36] . It was shown in [34] , that the presence of a virus resulted in a dramatic change in source-drain current. In [35] , the presence of influenza A virus results in discrete changes in conductance while no change in conductance occurs in presence of other viruses such as adenovirus, which demonstrates the high selectivity of the sensor. In [36] , an air sampler was integrated with FET and it was shown that discrete conductance changes were observed when sensor was exposed to aerosols and the change was proportional to the aerosol concentration. The setup was able to detect in real-time and the whole process of sampling, sensing and detection occurred in less than 2 minutes.",

The accumulating nature of the aerosol channel can also result in significant inter-symbol interference (ISI). A passive solution to overcome the effects of ISI is to introduce large delays between the time a person leaves the room and the next person enters so that the aerosols are dispersed. Another solution can be to incorporate the accumulation effect in the detection mechanism and update the decision threshold each time a person leaves the room. However, a more efficient method is using enzymes that react with accumulated viral aerosols and keep them from interfering in future [46] . We assume that such method has been employed to take care of interference effects such that each new person entering the room is exposed to a sanitized environment; thus the interference can be ignored.",

It is worthy noting that the receptor's size and density determine the hitting probability which eventually change the binding noise. It has been shown for diffusionbased MC that higher number of smaller receptors improve the hitting probability [51] . In our system, the effect of receptor size and density is implicitly captured through \u03b3, however, the impact of the receptor density, size and geometry can be analyzed in detail in future studies.",

The air flow velocities are chosen to represent the scenario of exhaled nasal breath where it is below 140 cm/s, cough scenario or breath with artificial air flow [52] . First, we observe that the spatial viral signature depends mainly on airflow velocity.

The mathematical modeling of aerosol channel provides insights into the dynamics of virus spread that can prove helpful in its detection. Applying artificial airflow overcomes the slowness of diffusion based spread and allows the detection of viruses, thus it is a key enabler for the viral detection system. The simulation results show that the missed detection is controlled by the distance, virus flow rate, air velocity, receiver binding efficiency and others. The proposed mathematical problem was studied using steady state analysis of virus transmission and detection due to breathing. It was further extended to transient analysis and response of system to coughs and sneezes. The transient analysis is important in multiple aspects of receiver design such as the memory channel behavior and synchronization. In future works, the work can be extended by relaxing the assumptions and incorporating complex wind fields, that results in different turbulence behavior. Moreover, it is imperative to optimize the receivers' size and/or location, and study multiple sources, interference, and different turbulence models.",

            "text": "System Block Diagram it can take several minutes for the signal to reach the receiver placed few meters away. Thus, the transmission process ensures that the time scale of this experiment is of the order of the minutes. Since the time within breaths (or exhalation time specifically) is too small relative to the coarse of experiment which is of the order of several minutes, the variations in emission process due to exhalation can be averaged out and the process can be approximated as a continuous and constant emission process. The emission rate might vary over time however we expect the average rate to be constant atleast for the coarse of experiment (of the order of few minutes). Although it is helpful if the variations in the emission rate can be incorporated in the system design, it is hard to find any such deterministic or stochastic model that can explain these variations in the literature. Most empirical studies that revolve around this subject are based on collection of breath samples of length varying from few minutes (\u223c 30 minutes) up to hours and reporting the cumulative effect. It is not clear whether the variations in per-second emission rate for the few minutes time windows can be evaluated with the current technology. Hence, we model the input signal as a continuous process with constant average emission rate which is equal to the average rate i.e Q g/sec.",

A simpler approach at this point is to assume a single viral source to ignore the interference effect, then evaluate the average response, which is what we derived in section III-B. For the electrical properties of receptors or Si-NW FET in particular, there is sufficient literature on noise modeling that depends on electrical properties of FETs[50]. However, since we want to focus on the spread of aerosols and their integration in a communication system, instead of diving deep into a well-detailed model particular for Si-NW FET, we opt for the basic model and as mentioned previously use an additive Gaussian noise.",
