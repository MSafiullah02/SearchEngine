A mode of nosocomial transmission that is unique to neonates is natal or intrapartum transmission of microorganisms from mother to infant derived from the maternal birth canal. Any microorganism found in the maternal birth canal can result in infection of the newborn based on the pathogenicity of the microorganism and the susceptibility of the infant (\nTable 2). NICU residents can also become infected with health care-associated infections through horizontal transmission of microorganisms spread by aerosol or contact (direct or indirect) transmission. Despite the enhanced safety of blood products administered in hospitals at the present time, the frequent utilization of blood products in the stabilization of critically ill newborns allows for the potential transmission of bloodborne pathogens, currently identified and those yet to be identified.12, 13, 14, 15\n",

In addition, health care-associated infection rates are higher in units that include neonatal surgical patients and in units that include nosocomial viral infections20 in their surveillance data. Duration of hospitalization, exposure to broad-spectrum antibiotics, and over crowding and poor staffing ratios23, 24, 25 are risk factors that have been associated with increased rates of health care-associated infections in the NICU. However, the best markers for the risk of nosocomial infection are birth weight, exposure to invasive devices, and acuity of underlying illness. In any effort to compare infection rates in NICUs, the data need to be stratified by birth weight, device days, and acuity of illness.",

            "text": "Bacteremias or bloodstream infections (BSI) are the single most important infections within the NICU because of their frequency and their potential for life-threatening consequences. Infants who develop bacteremia in the first few days of life (early onset sepsis) typically acquire their organism from their mother during the intrapartum period. The microorganisms responsible are found in the maternal birth canal and are transmitted to the infant either through an ascending route immediately prior to labor and delivery (especially in the presence of ruptured amniotic membranes) or through exposure as the infant is delivered. The illness is characterized by a fulminant multisystem disease, with a high mortality rate. Premature birth, low birth weight, maternal fever, premature rupture of membranes, maternal chorioamnionitis, and maternal colonization with group B Streptococcus are specific risk factors for early onset bacteremia and sepsis. Utilization of antimicrobial chemoprophylaxis to prevent early onset group B Streptococcus sepsis has successfully reduced the incidence of early onset group B Streptococcus infections26 but has been associated with an increase in early onset Escherichia coli infections in very low-birth-weight infants.27 Late onset bacteremia occurs after 5 to 7 days of age. This may be due to maternally derived microorganisms that colonize the infant in the intrapartum period or can represent infection acquired nosocomially (horizontal transmission). Most episodes of nosocomial bacteremia in the NICU are associated with indwelling vascular catheters.27, 28 Administration of lipids, low birth weight, respiratory tract disease on admission, catheter hub colonization, blood sampling through the central catheter, and treatment with H2 blockers also are independently associated with bloodstream infections.29, 30 If the infection occurs in the first 30 days of life, microorganisms most commonly identified are coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (CONS), Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus, and gram-negative enteric rods. After 30 days of age, coagulase-negative Staphylococcus is still the most common organism causing nosocomial bacteremia. However, fungi, particularly Candida\n31 species, and Malassezia furfur become more prominent. Infants whose birth weights are <1000 gram are at greatest risks for nosocomial bacteremia. Despite the recognition of the importance of nosocomial bacteremia in the NICU, the rate of bacteremia in NICU patients identified by the National Nosocomial Infections Surveillance (NNIS) System has not changed considerably over the last decade3, 32 (\nTable 4).",

            "text": "Critically ill neonates frequently have underlying respiratory tract conditions (hyaline membrane disease, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, meconium aspiration syndrome, and others). The respiratory status of the neonate may be further compromised by the development of pneumonia or tracheitis (Table 4). Similar to bacteremia, respiratory tract infections can be divided into groups by time of onset: early onset pneumonia versus late onset pneumonia/tracheitis. In the first few days of life, neonates who develop pneumonia usually have infections with microorganisms acquired natally. Group B Streptococcus, Listeria monocytogenes, and gram-negative enteric rods may result in an overwhelming respiratory tract infection that may be present very shortly after birth.33 Late onset pneumonia and tracheitis are more commonly because of infection with gram-negative enteric bacilli and Staphylococcus aureus. Endotracheal intubation is the major risk factor.33, 34 As with other invasive device-related infections, health care-associated pneumonia and tracheitis can be reduced by minimizing intubation days and proper care and maintenance of the ventilator-endotracheal tube circuit. Colonization of the endotracheal tube is virtually inevitable. Lower respiratory tract disease is not established by the mere presence of bacteria isolated from samples of the respiratory tract. Rather, lower respiratory tract disease is diagnosed by changes in respiratory tract signs and symptoms (eg, changes in oxygen requirements, new or changing infiltrates on the chest x-ray, increased volume or change in consistency of secretions suctioned from the endotracheal tube) combined with evidence of an acute inflammatory response, such as fever or polymorphonuclear leukocytes and a predominant bacteria on gram stain of tracheal secretions. Infants in the NICU are particularly vulnerable to community-acquired viruses. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), adenovirus, parainfluenza, and influenza can be devastating to the critically ill neonate and may be responsible for nursery-wide outbreaks.35, 36, 37\n",

Specific agents responsible for gastrointestinal disease may vary, based on the geographic location of the nursery, but viruses such as rotavirus,38 and enteric adenovirus and coronavirus, as well as Escherichia coli species and other gram-negative enteric rods are most commonly implicated.39, 40\nClostridium difficile presents a unique problem. Asymptomatic colonization of the neonate has been identified.41, 42 Neonates have reduced receptors for the Clostridium difficile toxin and therefore are less susceptible to development of disease following colonization with C difficile.\n43 However, although asymptomatic colonization may occur, neonates can develop disease because of Clostridium difficile. Identification of C difficile toxin in a symptomatic newborn without evidence of another pathogen, and particularly in the presence of colitis (stools with leukocytes and/or red blood cells), warrants therapy and isolation for C difficile. Necrotizing enterocolitis is a unique medical condition seen primarily in critically ill newborns. This condition is multifactorial in origin (immature gastrointestinal tract, ischemia; overgrowth of bacteria). Outbreaks of necrotizing enterocolitis have been temporally associated with nursery outbreaks with Klebsiella, E coli, Entrobacter cloacae, Serratia, Pseudomonas, Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, rotavirus, enteric Coronavirus, and Clostridium difficile.44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50\n",

Cellulitis, abscesses, and dermatitis are common and are frequently noted at sites of percutaneous puncture (lancets, scalp electrodes, and others) and surgical procedures or the sites of diapers or electrodes. Omphalitis is relatively uncommon but occurs more frequently in the preterm infant than in the term infant. Staphylococcus aureus is by far the most common microorganism responsible for all skin and subcutaneous infections in NICU patients. Recent increases of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), both endemic health care associated and community acquired, have made management of these infections more complicated. Vancomycin utilization has increased because many of the alternate antibiotics for MRSA have little experience or are not appropriate in neonates (eg, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, linezolid, daptomycin). Gram-negative enteric rods and yeasts are less commonly associated with skin and soft tissue infections than Staphylococcus aureus.

Clearly, when the employee is too sick to provide adequate care to their patients, they should not be at work. However, in many adults, these community-acquired respiratory virus infections result in only minor illness. If all employees with community-acquired respiratory virus illnesses were excluded from work, this might have a significant impact on staffing levels, which could also result in an increased risk for nosocomial infections by the infants. Good infection control practices, when followed strictly, should diminish the risk of transmission from the ill health care worker.

If resources are limited, it may not be possible to monitor rates of all infections. Efforts should concentrate on those infections that have higher morbidity or those that are more common within the nursery. Surveillance needs to be done in real time so that the information obtained can have an impact in a timely manner. Routine surveillance cultures are generally not recommended.67, 68, 69 However, surveillance cultures may be valuable when trying to identify a point source during an outbreak.",

However, judicious use of antibiotics may represent one of the more important measures for reducing the impact of infections within the NICU. Whenever possible, the narrowest spectrum antibiotics should be used to treat an identified infection or condition. Broad-spectrum antibiotics, particularly those that can impact the endogenous microbial flora of the gastrointestinal tract or skin, have the potential to eradicate many of the helpful bacteria and replace them with more virulent and antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Use of third-generation cephalosporins and vancomycin should be minimized, and possibly restricted, so that they only are prescribed for serious or life-threatening infections for which alternate narrower spectrum antibiotics are not adequate or appropriate. Antibiotics should only be used to treat proven or suspected bacterial infections. The entire antibiotic treatment course should be completed. However, antibiotics should be discontinued when the infection is cured or when it is likely that the condition is not due to a bacterial infection. H2 blockers should be avoided when possible. H2 blockers raise the gastric pH, which might play a role in promoting overgrowth of pathogenic bacteria or fungi. This increase in bacterial and fungal colonization might play a role in increasing respiratory tract and gastrointestinal tract infections in the ill neonate.",
