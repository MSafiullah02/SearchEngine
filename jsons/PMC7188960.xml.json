The CDC also noted that gown use could be suspended in nonendemic settings for lower-risk patient encounters.1 Such strategies may lead, especially if the local healthcare personnel infrastructure is also compromised, to more cross transmission and HAIs.",

Predictably, health systems will be negatively impacted by the global pandemic, and further penalties related to an increase in HAIs will further stress these systems. Although these measures are well-intentioned, consideration for relaxing penalties during the pandemic (and for a period afterward) should be considered. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) penalized ~800 hospitals for their HAI performance between October 2018 and September 2019, resulting in a 1% loss of reimbursement for Medicare patients.3 Fortunately, the CMS announced that reporting to the hospital-acquired condition (HAC) program is optional for the fourth quarter of 2019. Furthermore, data for the first 2 quarters of 2020 will not be counted for performance or repayment, and the related data do not need to be submitted to the CMS.4 Other non-CMS quality programs that utilize publicly reported HAI data to determine penalties should also consider adopting similar nonpenalty measures in the face of the current global health crisis.",
