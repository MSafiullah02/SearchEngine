These extraordinary properties render it an attractive material with potential for diverse technological applications and advantages over other comparable materials. [6] The most promising approach to utilize the unique properties of graphene is to use it in composite materials. In recent years, development of new property textile fabrics with multifunctional activity has gained a lot of interest. Incorporating graphene or graphene derivatives into polymers/textiles can improve the properties of fabrics for specific applications. [7] Graphene incorporation into fabrics or modification of a textile surface by graphene can not only improve mechanical strength, flame-resistance, conductivity, antibacterial activity, resistance to abrasion, and UVprotectivity but also prevents the diffusion of heat and gases. Graphene-based woven fabrics also exhibit excellent flexibility. All these qualities could be added to PPE textiles in one lightweight application (Figure 1 ) if textile fabrics could be modified by graphene/graphene derivatives.

[9] One of the hierarchy of controls for protecting both patients and HCWs from transmissible pathogens via exposure to body fluids and bioaerosols is use of appropriate PPE, especially when no actual treatment or prophylaxis is available for the disease in question. [1b,10] In the initial stage of an outbreak, drugs and immunizations may be inaccessible or deferred in development. In that case, such as the 2014 Ebola epidemic, PPE is the only available intervention to protect HCWs from acquiring infectious diseases. [1a,11] During several serious epidemics such as Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and Ebola, there have not been any drugs or vaccines for disease control, with nonpharmaceutical measures such as PPE being the only available protection for responders. [11, 12] Due to inadequate PPE and inappropriate PPE guidelines [13] many www.advmatinterfaces.de not only physiologically but also mentally stressful. As one of the riskiest occupations, firefighting is associated with a high number of injuries. Firefighters endured wounds and limited versatility because of failing to control their balance (slips or falls). [24] During firefighting sometimes firefighters may be exposed to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and other toxic chemicals. [25] While firefighting in hot and humid environment against multiple hazards (thermal, chemical, toxic gas, physical injuries, etc.), firefighters need flexibility in movement and motion. Heavy PPE (Figure 3) including personal protective clothing, helmet, mask, self-breathing device, gloves, boots, etc., limit firefighter's mobility and comfort. Firefighters can experience physiological strain and tiredness because of the high weight and bulky nature of PPE. They may also face cardiac stress, low breathability, accumulated sweat, and humid hot conditions. [26] Son et al. did a study on protective clothing of Japanese firefighters. The study concluded that aluminized fire jackets had inferior ventilation and flexibility, and aggravated heat strain more than the nonaluminized. However, nonaluminized jackets were worse for water resistance and maintainability. It restricted body movement and caused muscle fatigue while firefighting. [27] Again, wildland firefighters do their duty in adverse conditions and are exposed to both sun and flame radiation. [28] In heat stressed conditions, PPE can dramatically reduce their performance by reducing heat transfer and sweat evaporation. [29] This is exemplified in the work undertaken by Carballo-Leyenda et al. [30] They found that PPE led to a low perspiration evaporation rate, which increased the thermophysiological response of wildland firefighters and reduced performance by around 50%. [30] The firefighters protective clothing should not only protect from heat and hazards but also help the dissipation of internal accumulated heat. [31] This view is supported by Lee et al., who surveyed firefighters' desire for next generation PPE and found that the preferences were for smart features with location monitoring and an automatic body cooling system. [26d] The primary focus in the development of cutting-edge PPE fabrics for firefighters ought to be the development of basic and light materials that bolster the performance and safety while not reducing protection.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 114, "end": 117, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 382, "end": 389, "text": "[1b,10]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 637, "end": 644, "text": "[1a,11]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 951, "end": 955, "text": "[11,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 956, "end": 959, "text": "12]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1015, "end": 1019, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1312, "end": 1316, "text": "[24]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1445, "end": 1449, "text": "[25]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2009, "end": 2013, "text": "[26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 2391, "end": 2395, "text": "[27]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2510, "end": 2514, "text": "[28]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2639, "end": 2643, "text": "[29]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2714, "end": 2718, "text": "[30]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2896, "end": 2900, "text": "[30]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3044, "end": 3048, "text": "[31]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3263, "end": 3268, "text": "[26d]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1644, "end": 1654, "text": "(Figure 3)", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}], "section": "PPE for Healthcare Workers (HCWs)"}, {"text": "Law enforcement personnel may be the first to respond to an event, therefore have the least forewarning about potential hazards.

The hazards they face may be uncertain. During the 2018 Novichock attack in London, the first police detective to enter the premises became poisoned despite wearing some PPE. With increasing convergence of technologies accessible to criminal, exposure to chemical weapon, and biological hazards at the frontline will be an increasing concern for police. [34] Protection of first responders from weapons of mass destruction (WMD) is a matter of major concern. To protect people from the harmful effects of biochemical hazards, radiological exposure, and high-explosive weapons, appropriate technologically advanced PPE is a critical component. First responders who endure the initial effect of WMD rely on PPE, availability of appropriate disinfecting and proper treatment. [35] When on duty law enforcement personnel must deal with various kinds of hazards, thus need high level of personal protection. However, police have less of a culture of PPE use than firefighters or the military, and wear less PPE because of their continuous movement and patrol.

The materials used conventionally have both strengths and limitations. Graphene modified fabrics with its multifunctional properties may be a solution in the field of protective clothing. Since its discovery, graphene and its derivatives (graphene oxide, GO, and reduced graphene oxide, rGO) have promised several potential applications, which can be applied into everyday life. [54] Graphene is a 2D, single layer monoatomicthick hexagonally arrayed honeycomb lattice like material of sp 2 -hybridized carbon atoms. Graphene has some unique thermal, electrical, mechanical, and chemical properties, which made it a suitable material for diverse applications.

GO as oxidized modification of graphene, is monomolecular sheet of graphite consists of numerous oxygen bearing polar functionalities (epoxide, carbonyl, carboxyl, and hydroxyl groups). Due to the polar groups in its basal pinacoid, GO is hydrophilic in nature, which permits improved interfacial bonding with different fibers and polymers. This bonding of GO with fibers helps for enhancement of different functional properties. [55e,57] As functional groups can interact with each other, the polar groups can be modified by appropriate coupling agents to enable improved interactions with other polymers. [58] Good dispersibility and hydrophilic nature of GO, enables it to smoothly interact with polymeric fibers. However, due to oxygen functionalization GO has some inferior functional properties than pristine graphene, which can be restored by reduction.

Chemical reduction is preferable by most researchers as thermal method is not cost effective. [57a,60] rGO sheets loose its hydrophilic nature after removal of oxygen containing functional groups.

However, polyester can be chemically bonded with graphene nanosheets by modification with different functional groups to form an explicit interconnected assembly. [110b] Adhesives like BSA and dopamine are also found as an effective way to coat fabrics with graphene derivatives. As an amphiphilic polymer of amino acid BSA possess both hydrophobic (nonpolar) and hydrophilic (polar) character, thus can be attached to both organic materials and inorganic materials. [131] Surface charge of BSA largely depends on pH of the solution. It possesses positive charge and negative charge below and above pH 4.9, respectively. [8b] BSA, act like universal adhesive and when adsorbed on to fabrics below pH4.9 has positive charge. They perform by electrostatic selfassembly (Figure 9 ) to improve the bonding between GO (negative charge) sheets and fabrics (nylon, cotton, polyester, etc.). [132] This approach using BSA can be applied to present textile technologies. [133a] Dopamine has also been used as adhesive, which form a polydopamine layer on to the fabrics. Wang et al. prepared Ag/rGO-PET composite fabrics using dopamine and chemical reduction in presence of radiation. [130e] Chemical bonding through thiol-ene click chemistry was used by Zhao et al. to synthesize PET fabric-rGO composite with better thermal conductivity and perspiration. They reported that due to higher thermal conductivity (Figure 10 ) and moisture absorption the treated fabric composite has huge potential to use in daily and sportswear textile clothing. [121] The figure shows variations within fabric temperature beneath a forward-looking infrared. [121] It is realized from the photographs that the surface temperature of rGO modified fabric composite elevated with time compared to the untreated fabric, which proves that the treated fabric has better thermal conductivity.

[134] Polyamides possess good abrasion resistance and mechanical properties which is an important prerequisite for protective clothing, whereas lower thermal stability and sensitivity toward sunlight are the main limitations. Under high temperature conditions, polyamide fabrics have a tendency to oxidative decomposition and yellowing, which can greatly reduce the mechanical and wear properties of the fabrics.

Upon exposure to heat, oxidized polyamides form yellow products (azomethine groups), at the expense of the main polyamide chain.

Different approaches have been applied to fabricate nylon/graphene composites including melt compounding, [140] electrostatic self-assembly with BSA, [133a] microwave-assist polymerization (MAP), [120] functionalization of graphene oxide (GO) via esterification and solution mixing, [141] electrochemical method, [142] and in situ polymerization.

[155] Incorporation of graphene into of cotton fabric can impart many properties, such as electrical conductivity, flame retardancy, antibacterial ability, self-cleaning, UV protection, mechanical strength, antistatic, etc. [61,75,79,116,122a,c,156] Different techniques have been applied with different materials to fabricate cotton/graphene (or Gr-derivatives) composite. Cai et al. prepared rGO/cotton composite which displayed stable multifunctional activities like conductivity, UV resistance, surface hydrophobicity, etc. Plain weave cotton fabrics surface was coated by GO through a facile immersion and drying method. GO layer on the cotton fabrics were reduced by heat treatment under protection of nitrogen. [61] Same method was also used to fabricate (3-glycidyloxypropyl) trimethoxysilane (coupling agent) modified GO-cotton composite. The silane coupling agent modify the fabric surface by bonding with functional groups in the surface, thus improve the interaction between fabric and graphene derivatives.

Wang et al. reported cotton fabric coated by phosphorus doped GO (PGO) exhibit notable fire retardancy (Figure 14) and (Figure 15 ). [75, 79] As phosphorus-doped graphene oxide is negative in charge, sometimes a positive electrolyte such as polyethyleneimine can be used for fabrication. Smooth images of scanning electron microscope (SEM) indicates the strong interaction and good compatibility of PGO with fabrics. Due to strong interaction of PGO with cotton fabrics, PGO wrapped cotton fabrics show good fire-retardant ability. The mechanism of fire retardancy of cotton fabrics is GO restrict the penetration of oxygen and combustible gases like a barricade, while phosphorus promotes the formation of char. [79] However, the flame-retardant study of graphene modified textiles is still in initial phase and new plan of action is required for more exploration.

Fe, N doping, hydrolysis of TiO 2 , plasma treatment, treatment by BSA, simple dip-dry process, etc., are being applied. [115b,122,161] TiO 2 can attach with graphene sheets by several reasons, like free electrons-unpaired \u03c0 electrons bonding of TiO 2 and carbon atoms, electrostatic attachment of Ti 4+ with functional groups of GO and hydrogen bonding. [122a] In the photoactivity mechanism (Figure 18) , a UV light source (photon) possessing energy greater than bandgap of TiO 2 is allowed to interact with TiO 2 . Then free electrons come out to the photocatalyst surface. The freed electrons generate reactive oxygen species, ROS (OH\u22c5, and O2\u22c5 \u2212 ), when react with free O 2 or water. The ROS damage or degrade and cause toxic effects in organisms.

Thus, photocatalytic process become more effective when TiO 2 is modified with graphene. [122c,163] The one limitation is TiO 2 nanoparticles demonstrate photocatalytic action only under UV light.

Different chemical modification of CNTs and many methods have been applied to different fabrics such as cotton, [171] Kevlar, [172] polyamide 6,6, [173] polyester, [174] polytetrafluoroethylene, and Nomex fiber.

[170] At the same time, due to its high surface area and high conductivity, carbon black is generally used to enhance conductivity, electromagnetic shield, and strength of composites. Carbon black nanoparticles (CBNP) are comparatively inexpensive and can be easily mixed with polymer matrices. [177] CBNPs have been used with polymers or fabrics like polyethylene terephthalate, [177a,178] polyester, [179] and polyethylene.
