Especially, the disposal of hospital waste has been a serious environmental problem because the wastes also contain infectious wastes and will pose a great health risk to the public if they are not properly disposed of. For example, diseases like diarrhea, leptospirosis, typhoid and cholera can be transmitted through mismanagement of wastes. Moreover, because of the recent acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) dilemma, Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic, Avian influenza and those posed by other communicable diseases such as hepatitis B, the public is increasingly concerned over the handling of medical waste.",

            "text": "Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) research data and industry operating experience indicate that incineration has historically been the most widely used treatment technology for the disposal of medical waste (Lee and Huffman, 1996). There are many other technologies such as autoclaving, gas sterilization, and chemical disinfection, but many unavoidable disadvantages exist in each method, such as tail gas pollution and exhaust of dioxins to the environment in waste incineration. Now a novel pyrolysis technology for the treatment of medical waste is coming into use (Zhang et al., 2003), which could reduce waste mass, make it innocuous, and finally convert it into fuel; the technology has been proposed for the treatment of municipal solid waste (MSW) and biomass by many scientists (S\u00f8rum et al., 2001, Font and Williams, 1995, Garc\u00eda et al., 1995). In China, high-temperature pyrolysis technology has been designated in centralized treatment technology criterion of medical waste issued Dec 2003 by the government. So it is important to have knowledge on the characterization of medical waste related to pyrolysis.",

However, for other components, like tube for transfusion, sample collector for urine, catheter, filling of dressing and dressing, there appear two stair stepping stages (see Fig. 1), which are clearly expressed with two prominent peaks in Fig. 2. This is caused by the individual physical and chemical composition of each test matter, playing a fundamental role in pyrolytic behavior. For example, tube for transfusion mainly consists of PVC (polyvinyl chloride), presenting two-stage degradation behavior. The first stage is the de-hydrochlorination of the polymer and the formation of a proportion of volatile organic compounds; during the second stage, the evolution of toluene together with a small quantity of other alkyl aromatics takes place, yielding a residual char (Marcilla and Beltran, 1995). In the case of dressing, the multi-material containing paper, synthetic fibre and gauze, such three physical ingredients control the pyrolytic behavior together, presenting two-stage weight loss.",

Thus, it is observed that the obvious weight loss of plastic matter occur at 200\u2013580 \u00b0C, with two-stage decomposition for tube for transfusion, sample collector for urine and one-stage decomposition for one-off medical glove. The degradation of rubber matter take place in 250\u2013500 \u00b0C, connected to the pyrolysis of natural rubber, with maximum rate of weight loss at 396 \u00b0C. But there is still second stage weight loss for catheter as stated above. The decomposition of cellulosic and protein matter appear in 200\u2013420 \u00b0C and 230\u2013480 \u00b0C, respectively, with the T\nmax at 382 \u00b0C and 350 \u00b0C, respectively. For the synthetic fibre fraction (filling of dressing), two stages of weight loss in 270\u2013390 \u00b0C and 390\u2013510 \u00b0C can be observed. The last fraction, multi-material, showing a more complex reaction behavior at 220\u2013470 \u00b0C, has not been discussed here. It is concluded that plastic, protein, cellulosic matter, synthetic fiber and rubber matter enter the pyrolysis process one by one; however, the pyrolysis process of plastic and synthetic fiber ends after that of other materials.",

So, in view of pyrolytic reactivity, samples may be ranked in the same decreasing order. The lower the value of I\nr, the poorer the ability to pyrolyze.

The activation energy of secondary stage pyrolysis is quite higher than that of the first stage and that of only one stage.2.The maximum of rate of weight loss highly centralizes within 310\u2013450 \u00b0C.3.The weight loss of the absolute majority of test samples is up to 95% at 800 \u00b0C, which proves that the pyrolysis technology can remarkably reduce the mass of waste.4.When the heating rate increases, the TG curve and DTG peak shift to high temperatures and the main reaction interval of the sample becomes longer.5.It is advisable that assuming that every stage pyrolysis of medical waste components was only controlled by one major reaction mechanism; the kinetic parameters in this stage were invariable with temperature increasing.6.It is observed that, roughly, the results show a comparatively good agreement between calculated and experimental curves, proving that the model of single reaction mechanism dominating each decomposition stage is adoptable.7.From the comparison with kinetic parameters obtained by other authors, some results are very close, others show an acceptable dispersion. Differences can be attributed to the effect of experimental conditions, to the kinetic model used, and especially to the special physical and chemical treatment of medical wastes in the manufacturing process for meeting medical application.\n",
