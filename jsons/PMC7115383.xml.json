            "text": "Acute respiratory tract infections are flourishing in closed and crowded environments. Military recruits are prone to outbreaks of acute respiratory tract infections because of their crowded living conditions in barracks, stressful work environments, frequent travels and exposure to novel strains of respiratory pathogens [1], [2], [3]. Over 90% of acute respiratory tract infections are caused by viruses, such as influenza virus, parainfluenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, rhinovirus, adenovirus and coronavirus. Though most of viral respiratory infections usually represent mild, self-limited clinical manifestations, they are leading causes of morbidity in certain groups or populations (e.g., children, military population) and remain a heavy burden of disease [4], [5]. In history, the famous \u201cSpanish influenza\u201d initiated from army recruits in 1916 [6]. In 1976, the novel A/New Jersey/76 (Hsw1N1) influenza virus caused severe respiratory illness in soldiers at Fort Dix [1]. Adenoviruses have been the most important cause of febrile acute respiratory disease in US military recruit populations [7]. In China, a comprehensive surveillance systems for influenza in military population showed that the average incidence of influenza was 1.4 episode per person-year from 1995 to 2000 [8]. Viral respiratory infections have become one of the most actual health problems in military population. Therefore, it is necessary to seek reasonable and effective measures to prevent outbreaks and epidemics of acute viral respiratory infections among military population.",

The previous studies have suggested that high dosage of intranasal interferons can prevent respiratory infections caused by viruses, such as influenza virus, rhinovirus, coronavirus and respiratory syncytial virus [10], [11], [12], [13], [14]. However, the major problem is higher frequency of local side effects such as mucosal irritation, dry mucous membranes, blood-tinged mucus and nasal mucosal erosion [15], [16], [17]. Recently, YUANCE Medicine Company (Beijing, China) has developed a low-dose recombinant human interferon \u03b1-2b (rIFN\u03b1-2b) nasal spray in order to reduce adverse reactions. To evaluate the efficacy and safety of this new nasal spray in preventing acute respiratory infections in military population, we performed this randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial.",

Candidate subjects were male recruits who aged 16\u201323 years, and finished army physical fitness examination.

All candidates were observed two weeks before enrolling into the study, in order to screen eligible subjects. A total of 1500 trainees from three areas enrolled the trial initially. After the screening had been completed, 1449 eligible recruits remained in the subject pool. All participants understood the implications of the study, and provided informed consents.",

For the statistical analysis of body temperature parameters, a repeated measures ANOVA model was used. The level of statistical significance was established as p\n < 0.05. Meanwhile, intention-to-treat (ITT) and per protocol (PP) analysis were performed as the assessment. Parameters for assessment of benefits or harms of the intervention included: the rate at which events occur in the control group (the control event rate, CER), the rate at which events occur in the experimental group (the experimental event rate, EER), relative risk (RR), absolute risk reduction (ARR), relative risk reduction (RRR), and number needed to treat (NNT). Measures of RR, RRR, ARR and NNT were determined as these following formulae: RR = EER/CER, ARR = CER\u2013EER, RRR = ARR/CER, NNT = 1/ARR [18].",

Furthermore, not all kinds of viral etiological respiratory infections have been available for specific prevention and still have unknown pathogens. In the recent decade, several novel respiratory viruses which caused serious illness have been identified, such as human metapneumovirus (Hmpv), new SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) that associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), H5N1 flu virus and novel H1N1 virus, which increase the difficulty of the immunological prevention for viral respiratory infections.

In addition, respiratory viruses are frequently detected in respiratory tract secretions samples from healthy people [26], [27]. The determinations antibodies against respiratory viruses by comparing acute and convalescent serum specimens in infective people may sometimes be helpful to confirm a specific causative infection.

The RR is a ratio of the probability of the event rate occurring in the exposed (or experimental) group (EER) versus a non-exposed (or control) group (CER). In interventional trials, if the treatment arm is effective in preventing disease then the RR will be less than one, and vice versa. The RRR is the percent reduction in events in the EER compared with the CER. In other word, the RRR presents the percentage of the risk that has been reduced by the intervention in the control group. The ARR is the arithmetic difference in the event rate between treatment group and control group. In interventional trials, if the treatment arm is effective in preventing disease then ARR will be positive quantity, on the contrary, if the treatment arm is harm, ARR will be negative. RR and RRR can be used to quantify the relative magnitude of the protective (treatment) effects. The ARR can be used to measure the absolute difference in event rates between two populations. Therefore, ARR is considered as a more intuitive measure than RR and RRR. These years, the number needed to treat (NNT) has become a widely used index for interpreting the magnitude of treatment benefits or harms. The NNT is the inverse of the ARR. It represents the expected number of persons who must be treated with an intervention in order to prevent one additional adverse outcome event (or, depending on the context, to expect one additional beneficial outcome), compared to the expected event rates under the control. That is to say, the smaller the NNT, the more effective the treatment. Therefore, besides RR, RRR and ARR, we used the NNT to express the size of efficacy of the rIFN\u03b1-2b in the present analysis.",

The NNT for ADV was 25 (95% CI: 12.5\u2013553.9), which indicated that the benefits of preventing ADV infection with the rIFN-\u03b12b may be less than above infections with any three viruses above. The NNT for RSV was 50 (95% CI: \u2212313.6 to 23.1), which indicated no effect in preventing RSV infection among recruits with the rIFN-\u03b12b nasal spray.",

Most of the clinical features reported were comparable between the control and the experimental groups. Except epistaxis, no other known severe adverse events (such as allergy, high fever, nasal mucosa erosion and hemafecia) of the intranasal interferon were reported during the trial. The RRs of dry pharynx and epistaxis were 1.70 (95% CI: 1.39\u20132.08) and 1.85 (95% CI: 1.06\u20133.23), respectively, which indicated that dry pharynx and epistaxis might be linked to the interferon. However, the incidence of epistaxis was low and the clinical signs were mild and transitory in present study. The results are the same as our previous study [28] and the risk is much lower than that appraised and summarized in evidence-based medicine (OR = 4.52, 95% CI = 3.78\u20135.41) by Jefferson and Tyrrell [29].",

However, the limitations of this trial may be found on sampling and sample size. All subjects enrolled were healthy and young male recruits, so it may be difficult to extrapolate the conclusion to other populations. The sample was not large enough for evaluating the effects for ADV and RSV infections which had relative low incidence in the army recruits. The efficacy of preventing viral respiratory infections by the rIFN\u03b1-2b nasal spray should be evaluated further in different population groups, such as children and the elderly, and more samples should be involved in the further study.",
