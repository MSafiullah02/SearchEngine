In order to provide a brief review of the two groups, i.e. the Pan American Group for Rapid Viral Diagnosis (PAGRVD) and the Clinical Virology Symposium (CVS) joining together, the readers are referred to the following three chapters. We hope this booklet will provide useful information for those interested in Clinical Virology, including physicians, medical students, interns, and residents as well as laboratory and research investigators.",

Stanley Plotkin, the president of the PAGRVD, suggested to have the two groups join together for their annual meetings in Clearwater, Florida. (see Stanley Plotkin memorandum to officers and council members of PAGRVD on April 25, 1986). Support for the concept was indicated by John Sever\u2019s letter to Stanley Plotkin (dated April 29, 1986). On May 7, 1986, a letter from Steven Specter and Gerald Lancz was sent to Stanley Plotkin agreeing with the above suggestions. Joseph Waner was the newsletter editor and ensured that the news regarding PAGRVD and the CVS would have joint annual meetings in Florida for the coming years, (Joseph Waner\u2019s letter to Steven Specter on May 28, 1987).",

For a long time, many investigators involved in the clinical virology field were looking for a place to call \u2018home\u2019 since the field was made up of scientists from a wide range of disciplines.",

In order to illustrate the relationship between clinical and diagnostic virology (Fig. 1\n), \u2018Clinical Virology\u2019 was conceived as the bridge between the clinicians and the laboratory investigators. The meeting was an opportunity to get together, understand each other and complement each other in order to have better individual patient care and population management. Attendance at the CVS has increased. Each year an excellent program is developed in aspects of clinical, diagnosis and treatment providing informative, state of the art information about clinical virology that fully meets the needs of the attendants. As the PASCV has grown, it forms a network through which knowledge is exchanged, new ideas are generated and collaborations established through these annual meetings.",

Dr. Sever indicated that there was a need for such a meeting in the East since the Medical Virology meeting was mostly individuals from the Western USA. Dr. Sever had participated in three previous meetings in clinical virology that Dr. Specter had helped to organize and indicated that he would be a good person to begin such a meeting. After some additional coaxing from Dr. Sever and a conversation with Dr. de la Maza, Dr. Specter decided to pursue organization of the meeting. In the fall of 1984 Dr. Specter attended the ICAAC meeting and while there, attended the annual meeting of the Pan American Group for Rapid Viral Diagnosis (PAGRVD). At that session Dr. Specter invited the society to co-sponsor the meeting and to honor their Wellcome Diagnostics award recipient Edwin Lennette, M.D., Ph.D. at the symposium banquet.

The Clinical Aspects session was changed to day 1 and the Diagnostic session was switched to day 2 so that the second day would be all Diagnostic Virology. In 1990 the Sunday Workshop was our first on PCR and was held for a full day; it returned to the one-half day format the next year but was discontinued in 1992. In 1991 the oral presentation of abstracts was replaced by a panel discussion, which was very well received and has continued. Panel Discussions were expanded in 1992 and two panel discussions replaced the Workshop that had been held on Sunday afternoon. In 1994, the 10th CVS, we replaced one of the panel discussions with a series of clinical case presentations. These were highly praised and have been included as part of the symposium on an annual basis. In 1997 we lost a dear friend and active participant in the case presentations, Phil Hanff.

In 1996 the PAGRVD awards were expanded to include the duPont Young Investigator award, which was given to Rick Hodinka; the award was subsequently dropped thereafter by duPont.

Improved reagents were being made and used by the comprehensive diagnostic laboratories, and commercial companies were beginning to put resources into making products available to all laboratories. Additionally, the National Institutes of Health was beginning to consider rapid viral diagnosis as a potential discipline worthy of support. In that atmosphere, The Pan American Group for Rapid Viral Diagnosis (PAGRVD) was founded in 1977 by a small group of forward-thinking virologists with clinical and basic science interests. The salient mission of the Group was to promote the development and application of techniques that would make the diagnosis of viral infections rapid. The nature of viral diagnosis at the time was such that the Group was small in number and thereby able to communicate experiences and to exchange reagents more readily. PAGRVD was not only a vehicle that focused technology but the Group also provided an educational resource to a skeptical clinical community. This was accomplished through a program of workshops and symposia and NIH-funded contracts that went to members of the Group. An important event in the evolution of the PAGRVD occurred in 1987 when the annual general meeting of the PAGRVD began convening in conjunction with the Clinical Virology Symposium held in Clearwater Beach, Florida each year. This occasion is described in an accompanying article.",

Retrospectively, it seems that the success of the PAGRVD was a major factor in influencing the changes. By the early 1990s, rapid viral diagnosis was a reality and new technologies were being adapted to achieve ever more rapid and sensitive detection of viruses. There were good commercial sources of reagents and diagnostic kits, and the emerging biotech industry had become an important adjunct to the clinical laboratory. As is customary with the passage of time, a younger generation of virologists that had not experienced the formative years was also emerging.",

At the Annual General Meeting held April 30, 1991, there was discussion about the possibility of broadening the mission of the Group and possibly changing the name to include other non-viral pathogens, such as chlamydia and mycoplasma.

Plotkin\u2019s further comments stated that the Group\u2019s emphasis should remain \u2018rapidity of diagnosis\u2019 and that clinical virology was implied in the term diagnosis. Chernesky forwarded Stan Plotkin\u2019s letter to Steve Specter, the president-elect of the PAGRVD at the time, and to the PAGRVD Council. He included a covering letter with constructive suggestions for new organizational arrangements that could retain an identity for the PAGRVD and expand the designated interests of an altered entity. To summarize, the salient issue appeared to be whether the traditional mission of the PAGRVD and the name should persist while expanding the scope of the Group to deal with new issues or whether rapid diagnosis would be submerged into a more encompassing society of clinical virology. Similarly, in 1994 the European Group for Rapid Viral Diagnosis (EGRVD) was discussing its own history and evaluating future aims (article by Dick Madeley, Chairman EGRVD, to the EGRVD, April 22, 1994). Since publication of that article, the EGRVD has become the European Society for Clinical Virology and the Journal of Clinical and Diagnostic Virology has become the Journal of Clinical Virology.",
