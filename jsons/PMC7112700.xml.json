By activating cell surface receptor complexes, they regulate processes that are involved in the growth, the differentiation, and the defense of various cells. Although lacking catalytic domains, members of the cytokine receptor superfamily mediate ligand-dependent activation of protein tyrosine phosphorylation (Yasukawa et al., 2000). Cytokines induce homo- or hetero-dimerization and activation of their cognate receptors thereby triggering the oligomerization and activation of members of the cytosolic janus kinase (JAK) family (Yasukawa et al., 2000). The activated JAKs subsequently phosphorylate further signalling targets including signal transduction and activators of transcription (STAT) proteins.",

Through their amino-terminal regions, activated JAK proteins physically and selectively interact with cytokine receptors (Dalpke et al., 2008) thereby allowing the phosphorylation of specific tyrosine residues in these proteins. The phosphorylated tyrosine residues in turn serve as docking sites for members of the STAT protein family (Darnell, 1997, Vinkemeier et al., 1998). STATs are subsequently phosphorylated by JAKs, triggering thus their dimerization and release from the receptor complex. Next, the STAT dimers translocate to the nucleus where they induce the transcription of cytokine-responsive genes (Darnell, 1997, Levy and Darnell, 2002). The signalling events outlined above were originally found to be initiated by type I interferons (IFNs); however, it is known today that this pathway can be activated by a large number of cytokines, growth factors and hormones.",

Negative regulation of JAK/STAT signalling is carried out by a number of factors. Among them suppressors of cytokine signalling (SOCS) were shown to play a prominent role (Endo et al., 1997, Naka et al., 1997, Starr et al., 1997, Yoshimura et al., 1995).

CIS inhibits cytokine signalling by blocking binding sites that are otherwise used to recruit and to activate STATs (Matsumoto et al., 1999). CIS is closely related to SOCS2; it inhibits the signal transduction of erythropoietin, IL2, IL3, growth hormone (GH) and prolactin, by binding the STAT5 sites of the respective receptor (Verdier et al., 1998, Yoshimura, 2005). Transgenic mice over-expressing CIS exhibited growth defects, impaired mammary gland development and reduced numbers of both natural killer (NK) and NKT cells similarly to STAT5a knock-out (KO) and/or STAT5b KO mice (Matsumoto et al., 1999). This phenotype is consistent with the notion that CIS plays a specific role in the regulation of the STAT5-mediated cytokine response (Matsumoto et al., 1999). However, mice lacking the CIS gene are phenotypically normal (Marine et al., 1999a).",

            "text": "SOCS1 is a 23.4 kDa protein (human prototype) that can be induced by various factors acting on or through a signal transduction pathway which is either STATs-dependent or -independent. These factors include cytokines, insulin, LPS, and CpG DNA (Dalpke et al., 2001, Kawazoe et al., 2001, Stoiber et al., 1999). SOCS1 strongly regulates macrophage activation through the JAK/STAT and the TLR/NF-\u03baB pathways (Ryo et al., 2003, Yoshimura et al., 2007). To suppress the TLR/NF-\u03baB pathway, SOCS1 binds to the p65 subunit of NF-\u03baB, thereby facilitating its ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis (Ryo et al., 2003). This mode of action is particularly important for the regulation of inflammatory processes, septic shock and innate/adaptive immune responses. SOCS1 can also block other signalling factors such as the insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) and IL1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK) (Fujimoto and Naka, 2003, Kawazoe et al., 2001). Moreover, SOCS1 may also inhibit the activity of IL4, IL6, and IFN\u03b3 (Fujimoto and Naka, 2003). Observations in mice lacking SOCS1 suggest that this protein plays a key role in the negative regulation of signalling initiated by IFN\u03b3 (Morita et al., 2000). SOCS1 also has role in the control of viral and parasitic infections by means of its capacity to modulate the sensitivity of cells to both IFN type I (IFN\u03b1 and IFN\u03b2) and type II (IFN\u03b3) (Yoshimura et al., 2007, Zimmermann et al., 2006). SOCS1 (as well as SOCS2 and SOCS3) mRNA expression was found to be up-regulated after administration of another type I IFN, IFN\u03c4, in the uterus of cyclic ewes, suggesting an additional role for SOCS proteins in the negative regulation of fertility-related IFN\u03c4 signalling in ruminant dams (Sandra et al., 2005). Finally, SOCS1 has a pivotal function in T lymphocyte development and regulation and is therefore highly expressed in the thymus throughout all thymocyte developmental stages (Marine et al., 1999b, Trop et al., 2001).",

For example, there is 100% identity between human and porcine SOCS1 aa sequences in all the major functional regions of the protein (KIR, ESS, SH2, and SOCS box). Unsurprisingly, sequence differences between mammal species are most frequently observed outside of the functional regions. More prominent aa sequence differences are observed between galliform birds (chicken and turkey) and mammals, especially regarding the length of the Poly-Ser region and the sequence of the SH2 domain (Fig. 4). The high level of identity between mammalian SOCS1 amino acid sequences suggests a conserved functional mechanism of SOCS1 activity in response to microbial infections. Despite fundamental differences in the aa sequences of mammalian and avian SOCS1, it appears as if a strong cytokine (IFN type I) regulatory activity of SOCS1 is also conserved in the chicken (S.

            "text": "SOCS3, a 24.8 kDa protein (human prototype), is the second best characterized member of the SOCS family. Through its KIR domain, which is shared with SOCS1 (see Fig. 1), SOCS3 can block the catalytic site of JAKs as a pseudo substrate (Sasaki et al., 1999). In the presence of LPS and following TLR4 stimulation, SOCS3 expression is strongly induced in macrophages (Yasukawa et al., 2003a). SOCS3 is a key regulator of the divergent activities of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL6 and anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL10. This differential regulation is achieved through its selective binding to the GP130 receptor of IL6, while it does not bind the GP130 receptor of IL10 (Yasukawa et al., 2003a). SOCS3 specifically binds the phosphorylated tyrosine 757 (pY757) of the GP130 receptor (Nicholson et al., 2000, Schmitz et al., 2000), which is also the target of the signalling factor SH2-domain containing protein tyrosine phosphatase 2 (SHP2) (Nicholson et al., 2000, Schmitz et al., 2000). SOCS3 also competes with SHP2 further downstream in the pathway (Alexander, 2002). In some acute or chronic pathological conditions, SOCS3 can also suppress inflammatory responses in which IL6 or other pro-inflammatory cytokines are involved. By reducing the expression of IL6 and IL23, SOCS3 acts as a negative regulator of Th17-cell differentiation, which is involved in inflammatory diseases (Chen et al., 2006).",

Remarkably, only a small number of differences are observed between mammalian species and the chicken (Fig. 5). This high degree of conservation suggests a common immunomodulatory role of SOCS3 in most vertebrate species. This assumption is also supported by a recent study on SOCS3 cytokine regulatory activities in the turbot (Scophthalmus maximus) (Zhang et al., 2011a). Therefore, it is likely that most of the observations made in the mouse model are also valid in other mammalian species, including farm and companion animals. Only recently, a link between nutritional Vitamin D deficiency, a down-regulation of SOCS3, and the onset of cardiac hypertrophy and inflammatory processes in epicardial adipose tissue has been established in a Yucatan mini pig model (Gupta et al., 2012). The lesions that developed in the mini pigs receiving a 12-month hypercholesterolemic diet deprived of Vitamin D were clearly associated with a decrease in the (mRNA/protein) expression of the Vitamin D receptor and SOCS3 in cardiomyocytes and epicardial adipose tissue (Gupta et al., 2012). This observation highlights the crucial function of SOCS3 in the development or prevention of pathological conditions in all mammalian species.",

By reducing IL4-induced activation of STAT6, this interaction efficiently inhibits Th2 polarization (Seki et al., 2002).

The outcome of infection is determined by a critical balance between anti- and pro-inflammatory responses (Kirschner et al., 2010). During Mycobacterium spp. infections, pro-inflammatory cytokine signals production is regulated by dendritic cells (DCs) (Flynn and Chan, 2001). Compared to uninfected cells, human macrophages infected with Mycobacterium avium showed a reduced response to IFN\u03b3 with diminished phosphorylation of STAT1 (Vazquez et al., 2006). The expressions of SOCS3 and SOCS1 in the infected macrophages were elevated at both the mRNA and protein levels, an over-expression that was directly correlated with the unresponsiveness of the cells to IFN\u03b3 (Vazquez et al., 2006). The up-regulation of SOCS1 triggered by M. tuberculosis (Mtb) binding to DC-specific ICAM-3 grabbing non-integrin related 1 (DC-SIGNR1) protein in DCs and peripheral blood monocytes was also reported to be different in healthy and diseased patients (Srivastava et al., 2009). Patients with a productive form of tuberculosis showed an increased expression of SOCS1, which was reduced after chemotherapy (Srivastava et al., 2009). SOCS1 expression was also shown to result in a blockage of IL12 secretion by infected DCs during Mtb infection (Srivastava et al., 2009). In a further study, Srivastava et al. (2011) demonstrated that SOCS1 knock-down in murine T cells significantly improved the ability of Mtb-infected macrophages to clear the infection.",

In a murine model of Chlamydia pneumoniae infection, a STAT1 and IFN\u03b1/\u03b2-dependent induction of SOCS1 has been observed (Yang et al., 2008). The induction of SOCS1 was linked to a moderate inflammatory response and RAG1\u2212/\u2212/SOCS1\u2212/\u2212 mice died early after infection showing severe pulmonary inflammation suggesting a pivotal role of SOCS1 in the control of the host's response (Yang et al., 2008).",

(2011) showed that Lactobacillus rhamnosus and Streptococcus thermophilus can up-regulate SOCS3 gene expression in human macrophages, both directly via the p38-MAPK signalling pathway in the absence of protein synthesis, and indirectly via bacteria-induced IL10 production. Similarly, in a previous study designed to assess the anti-inflammatory effects of L. plantarum, L. rhamnosus and L. acidophilus against Helicobacter pylori-associated gastritis, the authors assigned a beneficial role to SOCS2 and SOCS3 in the control of the infection (Lee et al., 2010). In fact, the authors demonstrated that a co-culture of H. pylori and probiotic bacteria with a human gastric carcinoma cell line induced the expressions of SOCS2 and SOCS3 with subsequent anti-inflammatory effects through STAT1/STAT3 activation and JAK2 inactivation (Lee et al., 2010). To summarize, there is accumulating evidence that bacterial pathogens takes advantage of the powerful SOCS protein functions to modulate the immune and/or inflammatory response of the respective host.

In man, the outcome of intestinal cryptosporidiosis largely depends on the immune status. In immuno-compromised patients, gastrointestinal symptoms progressively worsen until the patient's death (Colford et al., 1996). Despite the low tissue-invasive potential of C. parvum, both humoral and cell-mediated responses are activated by the host to control the invasion, the reproduction and/or the survival of the parasite (Deng et al., 2004, Kasper and Buzoni-Gatel, 2001). The constitutive expression of TLRs and intracellular Nod-like receptors by intestinal epithelial cells permit the recognition of the parasite and the immediate activation of the innate immune response (Petry et al., 2010). In a study aiming to decipher the regulation of TLR/NF-\u03baB signalling in human cholangiocytes exposed to C. parvum, Hu et al. (2009) found that two small endogenous microRNAs, miR-98 and let-7, were involved in the regulation of CIS protein expression via translational suppression. C. parvum infection in turn increased CIS expression in a TLR4/MyD88 dependent manner and down-regulated both miR-98 and let-7 expression. Consequentially, this down-regulation resulted in a decrease of CIS translational suppression (Hu et al., 2009). Furthermore, the same group found that C. parvum induced the expression of SOCS4 in human biliary epithelial cells to regulate the phosphorylation of STAT3 and STAT6 (Hu et al., 2010).",

L. donovani adopts an intracellular life-cycle, which allows it to escape the humoral antibody response. However, Leishmania parasites lack the machinery required for active cellular invasion, and therefore infections are preferentially restricted to macrophages (Rittig and Bogdan, 2000). Inside its host cell, L. donovani exists in a non-flagellated amastigote form and needs to protect itself from toxic antimicrobial molecules produced by activated macrophages (Bogdan et al., 1996). Infection with L. donovani promastigotes was shown to impair IFN\u03b3 mediated tyrosine phosphorylation and subsequently influence the JAK/STAT pathway in both human mononuclear phagocytes and human promonocytic U937 cells (Nandan and Reiner, 1995, Ray et al., 2000). In another study, it has been demonstrated that SOCS3 functions provide potential means for the suppression of macrophage activation during the initiation of the intracellular infection by down-regulating the expression of the IFN\u03b3R\u03b1 chain (Bertholet et al., 2003). The obvious link between SOCS3 over-expression and IFN\u03b3R\u03b1 down-regulation could be explained by the fact that SOCS3 can interact with members of the ubiquitinylation protein family and thus may target receptors to proteosomal degradation (Bertholet et al., 2003).",

Its multiplication in both phagocytic and non-phagocytic cells induces the production of IL12 and a strong IFN\u03b3 cell-mediated immune response (Sacks and Sher, 2002). In macrophages, T. gondii has developed different mechanisms to inhibit both the primary macrophage activation and the antiparasitic actions of type II IFNs. One of these mechanisms is the inhibition of IFN\u03b3 signal transduction, as determined by the reduction of IFN\u03b3-mediated MHC class II up-regulation and reduced expression of the inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) (Luder et al., 2003, Luder et al., 2001). T. gondii suppresses the IFN\u03b3-mediated activation of murine macrophages, through the induction of SOCS1 and CIS and subsequent impairment of STAT1 tyrosine phosphorylation (Zimmermann et al., 2006). It was further shown that a virulent genotype I strain of T. gondii inhibited the up-regulation of MHC-class II and ICAM1 after IFN\u03b3 stimulation and reduced the production NO radicals, by inducing both SOCS1 and CIS expression (Stutz et al., 2012). In the latter study, SOCS1 induction was dependent on p38-MAPK signalling, egr2 and egr1 transcription factors activity together with an active cell penetration. Only recently, a role for STAT3 and SOCS3 in the context of T. gondii infection has also been evidenced (Mirpuri and Yarovinsky, 2012). The authors showed here that an abolishment of SOCS3 feedback regulation of IL6 signalling resulted in higher susceptibility of the respective KO mice to T. gondii infections due to an impaired IL12 production by inflammatory cells (Mirpuri and Yarovinsky, 2012).",

            "text": "Early after their discovery, SOCS proteins revealed their capacity to inhibit the signal transduction of type I IFNs (Song and Shuai, 1998). Hepatitis C virus (HCV) was the first virus for which the exploitation of SOCS protein functions was demonstrated (Akhtar and Benveniste, 2011, Bode et al., 2003). The flavivirus infects hepatocytes and may eventually cause liver cirrhosis and the onset of hepatocellular carcinoma (Alter, 1997). With its capacity to establish persistent, lifelong infection, HCV has been identified as an effective combatant of the host antiviral immune response (Choo et al., 1989). Like many other RNA viruses, HCV has developed strategies to impair the host's antiviral type I IFN response (Raglow et al., 2011). In chronically HCV-infected patients, Th1 and cytotoxic responses are decreased in the liver and peripheral blood (Thimme et al., 2001). Some studies revealed functional interactions of the HCV core protein with gC1qR, a complement receptor (Frazier et al., 2010, Ni et al., 2011, Yao et al., 2008). Triggered by this interaction, HCV differentially regulates T and B lymphocyte functions through exploitation of programmed death-1 (PD-1) and SOCS1 functions (Frazier et al., 2010, Ni et al., 2011, Yao et al., 2008). The cross talk between SOCS1 and PD1 in human blood derived monocytes/macrophages was further shown to suppress expression of IL12 through the JAK/STAT pathway (Zhang et al., 2011b). The HCV core protein also induces expression of SOCS3 mRNA in human hepatoma cells and inhibits activation, tyrosine phosphorylation, and nuclear translocation of STAT1, thereby counteracting the antiviral activity of IFNs (Bode et al., 2003). Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that the HCV core protein (genotype 3a) can modulate the expression of SOCS7, which is involved in the development of insulin resistance (Pazienza et al., 2010). This expression appeared to be STAT3 independent and to be regulated by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma activity (Pazienza et al., 2010). In conclusion, HCV employs several strategies to escape the host's immune response by hijacking SOCS functions. Importantly, this effective immune evasion strategy may explain the non-responsiveness of a substantial number (20\u201350%) of HCV-infected patients to antiviral treatments with pegylated interferon (PEG-IFN).",

            "text": "During primary infection, Herpes Simplex Virus type 1 (HSV-1) productively infects muco-epithelial cells of the respiratory or genital tract (Whitley and Roizman, 2001). Subsequently, the virus establishes latency in trigeminal or sacral ganglia until possible re-activation. Upon HSV-1 infection, IFN\u03b2 is transcriptionally activated following the stimulation of several pathogen recognition receptors and various signalling cascades including TLR3/IFN-regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3) and NF-\u03baB pathways (Paludan et al., 2011) (Fig. 2). IFN\u03b2 then triggers the activity the of JAK/STAT pathway with a subsequent type I IFN and SOCS induction (Sato et al., 2000). One strategy used by HSV-1 to escape host defenses and increase its capacity to replicate and/or to persist in the host is the induction of SOCS3 expression, which in turn suppresses the signal transduction activated by IFN\u03b2 (Yokota et al., 2001, Yokota et al., 2005, Yokota et al., 2004) (Fig. 2). SOCS3 expression reaches maximal levels at 1\u20132 h post-HSV-1 infection, and its induction is determinant to allow robust viral replication during acute infection. Indeed, viral replication was found to be reduced in cells unable to express SOCS3 in response to HSV-1, or when SOCS3 expression was inhibited through addition of the JAK2 inhibitor WHI-P131 (Yokota et al., 2005). A similar mechanism of resistance to IFN involving the induction of SOCS protein expression was observed in a keratinocyte cell line treated with pJAK2, a peptide inhibitor of SOCS1. This cell line, originally refractory to IFN\u03b3 anti-herpesviral treatment, started to respond to the treatment after the application of a SOCS1 antagonist indicating that HSV-1 induction of SOCS1 is one of the mechanisms of its resistance to an IFN\u03b3-induced antiviral state (Frey et al., 2009). More recently, IFN\u03bb-induced suppression of SOCS1 was shown to diminish HSV-1 replication in astrocytes and neurons, highlighting the requirement of SOCS1 for HSV-1 replication in cells from the central nervous system (Li et al., 2011).",

In addition, EBV latent infection induced the suppression of p38-MAPK activities (Lo et al., 2006). Altogether, these findings suggest that EBV can manipulate several anti-viral signalling pathways in a SOCS1/3-dependent fashion. Murid herpesvirus-4 (MuHV-4) was recently shown to inhibit NF-\u03baB activity in latently infected centroblasts of the germinal centre (Rodrigues et al., 2009). Remarkably, this inhibition, which was critical for the establishment of the persistent infection, involved the action of an unconventional SOCS box motif present in an MuHV-4-encoded protein instead of an exploitation of endogenous SOCS protein functions, illustrating yet another viral strategy to employ SOCS-related activities (Rodrigues et al., 2009).",

The tropism of HIV for Th cells, macrophages, DCs and microgial cells is determined at the level of viral entry by the concomitant use of CD4 as a primary receptor and co-receptors that are both strain- and target-specific (Peterlin and Trono, 2003). In order to suppress antiviral innate immunity, the HIV Tat protein induces the expression of different members of the SOCS protein family (Akhtar et al., 2010, Miller et al., 2011, Ryo et al., 2008, Yadav et al., 2009). Tat was shown to induce SOCS3-mediated antagonism of IFN\u03b2 signalling in macrophages both upstream, at the level of STAT1 and STAT2 activation, and downstream, at the level of expression of the type I IFN effector proteins, dsRNA protein kinase and interferon-induced exonuclease IGS20 (Akhtar et al., 2010). In addition, Tat was shown to induce SOCS2 to subvert type II IFN signalling in human monocytes (Cheng et al., 2009). Strikingly, over-expression of SOCS1 mRNA was also observed in PBMCs after HIV infection (Miller et al., 2011, Ryo et al., 2008). Ryo et al. (2008) also showed that, by physically binding to HIV Gag and facilitating the intracellular trafficking and stability of this viral protein, SOCS1 acts as a crucial host factor for productive HIV replication.",

One of these involves NF-\u03baB-dependent activation of SOCS3 expression, which negatively affects STAT phosphorylation (Pauli et al., 2008). Influenza virus infection activates anti-viral signalling primarily through retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I), an intracellular sensor of viral RNA genomes and replication (Kato et al., 2006). IAV was shown to induce, in human respiratory epithelial cells, the expression of SOCS1 and SOCS3, and both proteins seemed to differentially regulate type I IFN signalling (Pothlichet et al., 2008). The IAV-induced up-regulation of SOCS1 and SOCS3 appears to be TLR3-independent, but requires a RIG-I/mitochondrial antiviral signalling protein (MAVS)/IFNAR1-dependent pathway (Huang et al., 2011, Pothlichet et al., 2008). Pothlichet et al. (2008) proposed three potential mechanisms by which SOCS1 and SOCS3 may counteract anti-IAV signalling: (i) modulation of JAK activity, (ii) competition with STAT for binding to IFNAR1, and/or (iii) proteasomal degradation of SOCS-flagged antiviral cellular proteins including RIG/MAVS/IFNAR signalling elements.",

NS1-mediated inhibition of IFN-inducible signalling involved a reduction of both IFNAR1 and IFNAR2 gene expression, which was likely responsible for the observed decrease in IFN-inducible STAT phosphorylation and DNA binding (Jia et al., 2010). Strikingly, NS1 expression also induced an up-regulation of SOCS1 and SOCS3 (Jia et al., 2010) leading to an efficient abrogation of type I IFN signalling. Very recently a study aiming at elucidating the mechanisms behind the differential susceptibility of pigs and humans to a highly pathogen strain of H5N1 avian influenza virus (humans developing cytokine storm or hypercytokinemia when infected while pigs had barely no symptoms) has shown a potential central role of SOCS3 in this difference of susceptibility between mammal hosts (Nelli et al., 2012). Authors concluded that SOCS3 in pig cells is able to confer resistance against the establishment of hypercytokinemia by moderating the pro-inflammatory response (Nelli et al., 2012).",

RSV infects and replicates in the airway epithelium and in lung alveolar macrophages (Mellow et al., 2004, Wang et al., 2003). Infection of epithelial cells leads to the expression of host genes involved in the establishment of an interferon antiviral state. RSV infection has been shown to inhibit the type I IFN-JAK/STAT pathway (Ramaswamy et al., 2004). RSV nonstructural proteins NS1 and NS2 prevent the antiviral effect of type I IFN by specifically inhibiting the phosphorylation and activation of STAT2 (Bossert et al., 2003, Spann et al., 2004). A study using a type II alveolar cell line suggested an important role of SOCS1 in the regulation of the type I IFN response to RSV infection, highlighting the possibility that NS1/NS2 could in part mediate type I IFN antagonism through the induction of SOCS1 (Moore et al., 2008). In macrophage-like U937 cells, RSV also induced rapid expression of SOCS1, SOCS3 and CIS mRNA, which were associated with the inhibition of IFN\u03b1-induced STAT1 and STAT2 phosphorylations (Zhao et al., 2007).",

Next to HCV, other flaviviruses, namely the arthropod-borne viruses West Nile virus (WNV) and tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV), were shown to up-regulate SOCS1 and SOCS3 expression, notably in brain tissues from experimentally infected mice (Mansfield et al., 2010).

(2007) have designed a peptide mimicking the phosphorylated JAK2 activation loop (synthetic peptide pJAK2[1001\u20131013], LPQDKEYYKVKEP) that exhibits anti-infectious activity (Lucet et al., 2006). Peptide pJAK2[1001\u20131013] increased IFN\u03b3 activity and activation site promoter activity, blocked SOCS1 induced inhibition of STAT3 phosphorylation in IL6-treated cells, and enhanced Ag-specific proliferation (Waiboci et al., 2007). In another study, Frey et al. (2009), in an effort to find a therapeutic alternative to conventional HSV-1 drug treatments, evaluated the synergy between IFN\u03b3 and peptide pJAK2[1001\u20131013] in keratinocytes infected with HSV-1. The competition for SOCS1 binding between pJAK2[1001\u20131013] and its natural counterpart induced a strong antiviral state against HSV-1 in a dose-dependent manner. In a follow-up study, the same peptide was shown to inhibit the replication of vaccinia virus and encephalomyocarditis virus in cultured cells, and to protect mice challenged with a lethal dose of both viruses (Ahmed et al., 2010).",

            "text": "Using the third approach, Song et al. (2006) showed that SOCS1-silencing in DCs by siRNAs allowed these cells to better evoke anti-HIV-1 antibody and T cell responses in mice. Knock-down of SOCS1 also dramatically enhanced the ability to generate HIV-1-envelope-specific memory T cell and B cell responses (Song et al., 2006). Furthermore, in order to improve therapeutic and prophylactic vaccine efficiencies, a co-immunization approach with vectors encoding HIV gp140CF and SOCS1-specific siRNA was applied. The authors found that SOCS1-silencing enhanced the effectiveness of DNA vaccination as evidenced by an increased production of gp120-specific antibodies, and better CTL and CD4+ T cell responses in immunized mice (Song et al., 2006). Moreover, Subramanya et al. (2010) reported that targeting the SOCS1 siRNA to DCs through their linkage to a DC-specific fusion peptide enhanced the induction of co-stimulatory molecules and DC production of cytokines in HIV-infected individuals. The SOCS1-silenced DCs stimulated primary CD8+ T cell responses against various antigens in vitro (Subramanya et al., 2010). A similar approach was tested to improve anti-tumor therapy strategies (Shen et al., 2004). In this study, the authors showed that a vaccination protocol using SOCS1-silenced DCs strongly increased antigen-specific, anti-tumor immunity (Shen et al., 2004). SOCS1 silencing probably allowed antigen-presenting immunogenic DCs to persistently stimulate antigen-specific T cells in the murine vaccine recipients (Shen et al., 2004). The authors of this study postulated an inactivation of T regulatory cells by the SOCS1 silenced DCs through an enhancement of DC maturation and the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (Shen et al., 2004). Only recently, it has also been demonstrated that treatment with IL7 could improve the immune response to persistent infections caused by HIV, HBV and HCV by targeting SOCS3 (Pellegrini et al., 2011). While SOCS3 impaired T cell functions and promoted T cell exhaustion favoring viral persistence, IL7 treatment decreased the amount of SOCS3 within T cells and enabled early virus clearance (Pellegrini et al., 2011, Rincon et al., 2007). For the future, it would be interesting to further evaluate the experimental approach of down-regulating SOCS in order to improve the host's response to antimicrobial vaccines. This approach would be particularly relevant in large animal species which have been demonstrated as valuable models for the study of human infectious diseases, such as the pig (flu, tuberculosis and chlamydiosis) (Meurens et al., 2012) and cattle (RSV infections).",

All SOCS proteins have (i) a central SH2 domain, (ii) an amino-terminal end domain of variable length including an extended SH2 sub-domain (ESS) and (iii) a carboxy-terminal SOCS box. SOCS1 and SOCS3 contain an additional amino-terminal kinase inhibitory region known as KIR. The SH2 domain of each SOCS determines its target-specificity, through binding phosphorylated (P) tyrosine residues that are specific to each substrate, such as JAK proteins. The SOCS box interacts with a complex containing elongin B, elongin C, cullin5, RING-box-2 (RBX2), and E2 ligase (also known as E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme). This complex keeps the bound substrate close to the ubiquitinating machinery, thus facilitating its ubiquitination (U) and driving it towards proteosomal degradation. The KIR domain functions as a pseudosubstrate that inhibits the kinase activity of the SOCS-associated proteins. (B) Mechanism of suppression of the JAK/STAT pathway by SOCS1, SOCS3, and CIS. The cytokine or interferon stimulation of their cell surface receptors (1) activates receptor-associated JAK proteins by their phosphorylation (P). Then, activated JAKs phosphorylate receptor cytoplasmic domains (2). Recruited STATs are consequently activated by JAK phosphorylation (3). This phosphorylation enables their dimerization (4). Dimerized they can enter the nucleus and trigger as transcription factor complex the expression of various target genes including SOCS genes (5). Various SOCS proteins such as SOCS1, SOCS3 and CIS are produced (6). They can (7), as SOCS1 but also SOCS3, inhibit the JAK activity with their kinase inhibitory region. They can also, as SOCS3, compete with recruited STAT proteins for shared phosphotyrosine residues or specifically, as CIS, bind the phosphorylated tyrosine residues of cytokine receptors through the SH2 domain consequently masking the STAT5 docking site. Moreover, their SOCS box mediates ubiquitination and degradation of bound receptor components (8). Consecutively to their actions transcription factor complexes cannot anymore form and access the nucleus.",
