As of March 30, 2020, no treatment has demonstrated clinical efficacy against COVID-19. However, several treatment strategies are being considered and evaluated in numerous clinical trials. Among these strategies, the use of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) appears to be a promising option, although only limited evidence is available at the present time. Above all, HCQ has the advantage of being widely available to a large number of patients. HCQ is a well-known drug, effective in the treatment of malaria and autoimmune diseases. More recently, an in vitro antiviral effect has been demonstrated on SARS-Cov-2. Recent work by Wang et al. showed that a chloroquine concentration of 0.36 mg/L decreased viral load by 50% in a cell model [1] .",

HCQ can be responsible for adverse events and probably an increased incidence of adverse events in the case of inappropriate dosing regimens. One of the most serious adverse events in this population is cardiac toxicity, characterized by prolongation of the QT interval, which can lead to arrhythmia in patients at risk. HCQ also has very particular pharmacokinetic (PK) properties that require certain precautions. It exhibits strong tissue tropism, particularly for the kidney and liver, with a long half-life (several weeks).

In this study, we demonstrated that the 200 mg three times daily dosing regimen is inappropriate to reach a supposed target blood level of 1 -2 mg/L in this population. Using this dosing regimen, the mean time to reach therapeutic levels was more than 2 days and only 61% of patients reached target levels with this dosing regimen. This result is not surprising in view of the PK properties of HCQ [7] . HCQ presented marked PK variability with a very long half-life (5 to 40 days), particularly due to large distribution into blood and tissues. Steady-state concentrations are therefore achieved within weeks and vary from individual to individual with the same dosing regimen. However, ICU patients present certain characteristics that can affect the PK of drugs. For example, the presence of ECMO may affect the already altered PK of ICU patients by further increasing the volume of distribution, causing changes in clearance, and causing adsorption or absorption into the circuit [8] . In the one patient treated by ECMO in this study, HCQ blood levels increased more slowly than in the other patients.",

Some in vitro and in silico studies have reported a virustatic effect of chloroquine and HCQ and estimated the therapeutic blood level from EC50, ranging from 0.3 to 2.1 mg/L [1, 5] . The toxic HCQ concentration has not been established, although a number of arguments suggest that a concentration of 2 mg/L should not be exceeded to avoid ocular toxicity. However, the most dreaded adverse effect for COVID-19 patients is cardiac toxicity. To our knowledge, the M a n u s c r i p t relationship between cardiac toxicity and HCQ blood levels has not been determined, but it can be assumed that excessive HCQ exposure is likely to be harmful. In this study, two patients experienced cardiac toxicity at variable HCQ blood concentrations.",

Using physiologicallybased pharmacokinetic models, Yao et al. suggested a dosage of 400 mg twice daily for 1 day, followed by 200 mg twice daily for another 4 days [5] . This regimen could constitute an appropriate option, although the results of our study suggest that 800 mg once daily on the first day can more rapidly reach therapeutic levels in ICU patients. All of the 9 clinical trials concerning the therapeutic use of HCQ in COVID-19 registered in clinicaltrials.gov (on March 26) are using different dosing regimens. Based on our simulations, we demonstrate that some of these dosing regimens will fail to reach therapeutic levels, while others will probably induce levels higher than 2 mg/L. This work strongly suggests that the HCQ dosing regimen should be optimized on the basis of PK data available in special populations. There is an urgent need for health agencies to clarify the standard dosing regimen of HCQ in order to have comparable data across clinical trials, and to avoid dubious efficacy or toxicity results due to PK profiles.",
