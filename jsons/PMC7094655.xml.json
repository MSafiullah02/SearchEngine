In our previous study, VBRB showed good hepato-targeting efficiency by increasing the distribution of rhein, oxymatrine, and resveratrol in the liver of rats and mice [[2], [3], [4]]. These findings suggest that VBRB potentiates hepatic drug concentration, although the specific VBRB component responsible for the hepato-targeting effect and its mechanism of action are not known.",

Several recent studies have identified saikosaponins as the principal active component of VBRB, and have explored the activity of the native saponins (saikosaponin a, c, and d) [[5], [6], [7], [8], [9]]. However, other research suggests that the secondary saponins (saikosaponin b1 and b2), and not the native saponins (saikosaponin a, c, d), are the main components of VBRB in Radix Bupleuri [10,11]. VBRB is mainly used in the treatment of hepatic diseases. As indicated by previous studies, the effect of VBRB may be associated with the drug transporters in hepatic cells. In our previous study, we found that the hepatoprotective effect of VBRB was enhanced and the content of saikosaponin b2 increased when higher concentrations of vinegar were used to process it [12]. Overall, these studies indicate that saikosaponin b2 may play a key role in the enhanced hepato-targeting effect of VBRB.",

Because saikosaponin a is relatively stable, saikosaponin b2 is considered the index component of VBRB. However, there are limited reports with regard to its bioactivity. Studies have shown that VBRB has a good inhibitory effect on the human corona virus 229 E [15]. In addition, VBRB was shown to inhibit the entry of the hepatitis C virus [16]. Furthermore, saikosaponin b2 was shown to inhibit etoposide-induced NF-\u03baB activation in B16F10 melanoma cells, which exposed a new approach to overcome cancer chemoresistance [17]. Moreover, it was shown to cause IgE-induced mast cell degranulation, which was related to the inflammatory response [18].

Saikosaponin b2 had marginal effect on Pgp activity in the normal state; however, it significantly inhibited Pgp activity in Pgp-HEK293 cells. This finding suggested that the coadministration of antitumor drugs with VBRB may lead to hepatic accumulation of the drug and-, thereby, exhibit a synergistic effect toward achieving a clinical effect with less generalized systemic toxicity [1]. Furthermore, in normal HEK293 or in Pgp-overexpressing HEK293 cells, the protein and gene expressions were inconsistent with their activities. Pgp is an ATP-binding cassette transporter, whose function is not only dependent on the protein and mRNA levels, but is also related to the energy supply and other variables such as hepatic nuclear factors [19]. Other studies have shown that certain drugs modulate the expression of Pgp through certain cell signaling pathways. Kim et al. [20] found that metformin activated AMPK and suppressed MDR1 expression in MCF-7/adr cells by inhibiting the activation of NF-\u03baB and CREB. Seo et al. [21] showed that downregulation of Pgp through inhibition of the DNA-PKcs/Akt/GSK-3\u03b2 pathway may ameliorate multidrug resistance. Further studies are required to determine whether saikosaponin b2 modulates the function of Pgp via these signaling pathways.",

Saikosaponin b2 enhanced MRP1/Mrp1 and MRP2/Mrp2 function in normal cells, but significantly inhibited MRP1 and MRP2 activity in MRP1-HEK293 cells and MRP2-HEK293 cells, respectively. Both MRP1/Mrp1 and MRP2/Mrp2 normally participate in the detoxification process [22]. Thus, enhancing their function in the normal state helps to avoid the harmful effects of exogenous compounds in the body. However, high expression levels of MRP1 and MRP2 in lung, breast, ovarian, and hepatocellular carcinoma cells were associated with unfavorable outcomes and poor prognosis [[23], [24], [25], [26], [27], [28]]. Our results indicate that saikosaponin b2 may improve the therapeutic efficacy of antitumor drugs against multidrug-resistant cancers that cause overexpression of MRP1/Mrp1 and MRP2/Mrp2. Unlike the former three transporters, OCT2/Oct2 is an influx transporter that mainly transports cationic compounds. The frequently used antitumor drugs cisplatin and oxaliplatin are substrates of OCT2. Moreover, compensatory renal overexpression of OCT2/Oct2 has been demonstrated in hepatic diseases [29]; therefore, we studied the effect of saikosaponin b2 on OCT2/Oct2 under normal and overexpressed conditions. Saikosaponin b2 enhanced OCT2 activity in the overexpressed condition by upregulating both mRNA and protein expressions. Our study indicates saikosaponin b2 may aggravate the renal toxicity of platinum-containing anticancer drugs when used for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma.",
