A morphological operator modifies every point in a set (e.g., an image) according to the spatial arrangement of neighboring points. A stencil, called the \u201cstructuring element,\u201d with a predefined shape is placed on individual points, and if the surroundings of the point match (or not match) the shape of the stencil, then the point is modified. One particular operator, erosion, is important for our purpose. Erosion deletes all points whose surroundings mismatch the structuring element. Since a mismatch would typically happen near the boundaries of a shape, the erosion filter ends up rounding up and thinning down all shapes. This is the qualitative behavior we need in order get rid of the peripheral nodes of C and reach its core.",

The likelihood of a node being the origin node is proportional to the similarity between its stencil and the diffusion state. However, there are many ways to measure the similarity between a probability vector and a binary vector. We sampled the performance of different scoring metrics such as log-likelihood (under independent three-body correlations), information surprisal, and Picard distance. The results shown in this paper are based on the an information theoretical metric which we found to work best. For each node i inside the candidate set C of the given final network state, we apply an erosion score:\nSi=\u2211j1\u2212P(rj,j|i)Hb(P(rj,j|i)),where the weight Hb(x)=\u2212xlog2x\u2212(1\u2212x)log2(1\u2212x) is the binary entropy for the two-state diffusion, rj is the state of node j in the given final network state. In other words, Si measures the mismatch between the stencil and diffusion state weighted by the (binary) entropy, Hb, of the probability distribution. This weight will diminish the value of nodes with high variability (p\u22480.5) in comparison to nodes with low variability (p\u22480 or p\u22481). If the probability that a node is affected is very high or very low, then mismatches are weighted heavily and have a large negative influence on Si. On the other hand, the state of highly variable nodes are circumstantial, and thanks to the small entropic weight they do not have much influence on Si. Note that the score for candidate node i examines its stencil element, P(r,j|i), at every other node j. In other words, the stencil for any node involves all other nodes in the network and not just the nodes in the set C.",

If the relevant forward dynamics is one where nodes can take more than two states, then the binary entropy function should be updated to be the entropy for the probability stencil of node i causing node j to be in state r:\nH=\u2212\u2211rP(r,j|i)logeP(r,j|i).",

We then repeated the random assignment 100 times and averaged over all of the standard deviations. This removes the dependence on how the simulations were randomly assigned as well as provide a measure of error for a trial containing 100 simulations. Additionally, some realizations will not have a candidate set larger than one when the spread probability is very small.

In other words, the scoring could prioritize matching the diffusion state rather than the base state. In the case of multistate diffusion, one could introduce a transition matrix for the states where the elements of this matrix represents how easy or difficult it is to transition from one state to another. This matrix must be embedded into the scoring metric such that mismatches in state are weighted by the elements of this matrix. Additionally, some methods use a reduction scheme which considers more complex dynamics as two compartments. For example, Ref. [13] uses a SIR dynamic but then groups the status of I and R into a single compartment for their Jaccard similarity measure, which uses a binary status.",

Antulov-Fantulin et al.\n[13] uses a Jaccard similarity function to characterize the similarity between simulated spreads versus a given spread. This is then used to estimate the probability of a spread given a source via a Gaussian weighting and therefore we will refer to this method as the Jaccard-Gaussian algorithm. This method compares two network states, i.e., two binary vectors (nodes are either infected or susceptible) as obtained by Monte Carlo simulations versus a given final state. To compare two microstates of networks, Ref. [13] must generate, store, and compare all (or at least, most) possible realizations of a spread from every single candidate node. In contrast, we work with a single probability distribution defined over the network. Since the space of all possible N-node states (which Ref. [13] samples) is astronomically larger than the space of single node states (which we sample), we can leverage this gain in computational cost to sample our space more accurately. Our approach has another advantage: A forward model uniquely determines a stencil, and once we have our stencils for a certain model, we can use it for multiple C sets, say, for different realizations of the same disease. Reference [13], on the other hand, must realistically sample a combinatorially larger space for every realization of the spread. Another difference with Ref. [13] is in our scoring function; specifically, we use an entropic weight when comparing a single realization to a probability distribution. This allows us to decide which nodes to take more seriously than others.",

[13]:\n(3)|Pn(\u03b8map)\u2212P2n(\u03b8map)|\u22640.05,where Pn refers to the candidate probability distribution using a stencil of n simulated runs and \u03b8map refers to the most likely candidate node inside P2n. Additionally, the two probability distributions were generated from independent simulations. We used the same set of potential Gaussian widths as Ref. [13] and selected the smallest weight for which the convergence condition is satisfied. We generated a stencil of 200 runs for different values of the transmission parameter \u03bb and T=5 and stored these runs for testing the performance of our algorithm against the Jaccard-Gaussian algorithm. In all cases, the available information is the same for both algorithms. However, the convergence condition for the Jaccard-Gaussian method limits the stencil set from 200 to 134. Therefore, we limit our algorithm's stencils to use the same 134 simulated runs as well.\n",

By studying the specific dynamics, one can generate additional constraints and properties of the dynamics such as tree topology, exact analytical solutions, conservation laws, etc., that might aid in inversion [17,19]. Furthermore, the performance of our algorithm can be enhanced by extending what we have done with two-body correlations to n-body correlations or time-dependent correlations to calculate path integrals based on Bayesian inference (e.g., Ref. [12] for one specific model). However, generalizing such approaches for any forward model and any network topology is offset by the huge number of simulations required to resolve the correlations to within a useful error margin and will be very costly.",
