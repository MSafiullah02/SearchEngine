Forecasting is based on a compartmental SIR-type model, combined with a probability distribution for the time from infection to death.

The fundamentals of analytical models to predict disease spread were laid a century ago (e.g. [14] ), allowing models of the health risks associated with COVID-19 to emerge rapidly [11, 13, 17] ). The performance of these models depends critically on the quality of the initial data referring to the population affected (total population size, people diagnosed and deaths attributed to COVID-19 over time), the parameters specific to the COVID-19 propagation and impact (e.g. R0, Fatality rate), and the impact of mitigation measures on those parameters [22, 24] ). As COVID-19 spreads to many countries and other situations, such as vessels with large confined populations, multiple series of data are emerging that offer opportunities to improve the assessment of key parameters. Moreover, as the effort and resolution of testing varies over time, it has become evident that the number of diagnosed cases is unreliable as it depends on effort and particular kits used, which vary among and within nations. Although the number of deaths reported may also be underestimated, as COVID-19 deaths may be undetected or confounded with other causes, it provides a minimum estimate that is reported in a relatively consistent manner across many nations, following WHO guidelines, which require fatalities to be listed only where the disease caused, or is assumed to have caused, or contributed to death. 3",

This is not yet the case for COVID-19, given that estimates of the basic reproduction number itself differ substantially [31] . As a result, current predictions of COVID-19 infections and deaths differ by orders of magnitude [10] . Most of those predictions are based on confirmed case numbers, which are known to be highly inaccurate. Given these large uncertainties, we propose that a straightforward model based on relatively well-established inputs may be more useful than a complex model requiring poorly-constrained or highly inaccurate data and parameters. The present work is based on one of the simplest epidemiological models available, but with a focus on using the most accurate available inputs. The technique used herein to infer infections from recorded deaths could also be used to provide more accurate input to more sophisticated models, in place of confirmed case numbers.",

Our rationale for using the model (2) is twofold. First, due to the prevalence of asymptomatic cases and broad social-distancing measures, the dominant effect of intervention is through general reduction in the contact rate rather than quarantining of a small group. Second, the existing uncertainties in key parameters for this still-developing pandemic are likely to be much greater than the differences between various refinements of the model.",
