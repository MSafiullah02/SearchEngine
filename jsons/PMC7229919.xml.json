A population of candidate solutions called individuals to an optimization problem is evolved into superior solutions. This way, the population is evaluated, and the best solutions are selected to reproduce and mate to create the next generation. After a number of generations, good traits dominate the population and augment the quality of solutions. Due to genetic algorithm's fascinating features and its strong convergence, up to now, researchers have developed this algorithm and used that to address a wide variety of problems in different fields of study [19,20].",

Utilizing the model that has been investigated in this study and parameter estimation methods such as MCMC, at first, governments can estimate the model of the epidemy in their countries. Then, using a multi-objective genetic algorithm, they can set their optimal policies to prevent the epidemy efficiently. Through this method, governments could consider factors such as contact rate and transition rate of symptomatic infected individuals to the quarantined infected class and then they could wisely set their policy to prevent economic collapse and spread of the outbreak, simultaneously.",

Firstly, the state-space model of the disease has been investigated, and the impact of critical parameters on the epidemy have been described. Then, in order to efficiently design strategies, a multi-objective genetic algorithm was proposed, and through the multi-objective genetic algorithm, optimal policies were designed. Numerical simulations clearly show that considering the control of the spreading of the diseases as an optimization problem can help governments to choose strategies that prevent the disease outbreak as well as economic collapse. This way, this study can provide a reference for the prevention and optimal control strategies in various countries. As a future suggestion, other factors such as the rate at which the quarantined uninfected contacts are released in the societies can be considered as control actions for the prevention of the outbreak.",
