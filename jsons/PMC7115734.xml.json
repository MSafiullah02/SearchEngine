            "text": "hMPV phylogenic classification is illustrated by the method of its discovery. Van den Hoogen and colleagues3 identified 28 viral isolates from cultures of nasal secretions of patients presenting with symptoms of RTI. All isolates caused cytopathic effects in tertiary monkey kidney cells that were morphologically indistinguishable from, though later than, those of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). On electron microscopy, these investigators observed pleomorphic particles measuring 150 to 600 nm with short envelope projections and rare nucleocapsids, features that are characteristics of Paramyxoviridae. A representative electron micrograph of hMPV is shown in Fig. 1\n. Other results that were also consistent with inclusion of the new virus in the Paramyxoviridae included abrogation of infectivity by chloroform treatment, lack of hemagglutination of turkey, chicken, or guinea pig erythrocytes, and dependence on trypsin for replication in cell cultures.3\n",

Paramyxoviridae include the subfamilies Paramyxovirinae and Pneumovirinae; the Pneumovirinae subfamily is further divided into the genera Pneumovirus and Metapneumovirus. RSV is an important human pathogen in the Pneumovirus genus. Metapneumoviruses differ from pneumoviruses by the absence of 2 nonstructural proteins, NS1 and NS2, and a difference in gene order.3, 4 Sequencing data from hMPV demonstrate an absence of NS1 and NS2 open reading frames (ORFs) and positioning of the F gene adjacent to the M gene, confirming its classification as a metapneumovirus.4 The genomic organization of hMPV is 3-N-PM-F-M2-SH-G-L-5 with 2 ORFs of M2 coding for proteins M2-1 and M2-2. The other known member of the Metapneumovirus genus is avian pneumovirus.3, 5\n",

Three viral glycoproteins (attachment [G], fusion [F], and small hydrophobic [SH]) are believed to be inserted into the lipid envelope. The F protein contains an F1/F2 cleavage site in the hydrophobic region and has 2 heptad repeats in the extracellular domain, features distinctive for a viral protein that fuses viral and host cell membranes.6, 7 The G protein is a heavily glycosylated type II mucinlike protein, and its O glycosylation pattern, efficient export to the host cell surface, and type II membrane orientation suggest its role as an attachment protein.8, 9, 10, 11 The sequence of the G protein is highly variable between strains, similar to the RSV G protein, which suggests that there is serotypic variation of this protein (discussed later). A G-protein deficient mutant is able to replicate in vivo and in vitro, albeit less efficiently than wild-type hMPV, suggesting that G-protein is not absolutely required for viral replication.12, 13 The function of the SH protein remains unknown.",

In 2002, hMPV was identified at autopsy as the cause of a pneumonia-related death of a child being treated for ALL.73 Of 2 hMPV-infected children younger than 5 years old with ALL on chemotherapy, 1 died of acquired respiratory distress syndrome; of 2 adults older than 65 years old with leukemia, neutropenia and hMPV, 1 died of pneumonitis.53 In a prospective study of adult HSCT recipients with LRTI or URTI, 16 of 83 samples in which a pathogen was isolated tested positive for hMPV.74 The yearly infection rate in these patients was 3% to 5%. Five patients had LRTI; significantly more patients with LRTI had had allogeneic transplants, and 2 patients died. In a separate series, 5 HSCT transplant patients who tested positive for hMPV progressed to hemorrhagic pneumonia, respiratory failure, and septic shock, and 4 of 5 patients died. In symptomatic patients who had had a lung transplant 4% to 14% of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples tested positive for hMPV; all patients clinically recovered, although in 1 series 60% of lung transplant patients infected with hMPV developed graft dysfunction.44, 66, 75\n",

BAL samples show epithelial cell degeneration or necrosis with ciliocytophthoria and round red cytoplasmic inclusions, hemosiderin-laden macrophages, frequent neutrophils and mucus (Fig. 4\n).83 In acute disease, lung biopsies can show eosinophilic nuclear and cytoplasmic inclusions (Fig. 5\n).

In an analysis of respiratory specimens from infants with hMPV and RSV infection of similar clinical severity, hMPV elicited 2- to 6-fold lower production of IL-12, TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, IL-1\u03b2, IL-8, and IL-10.84 These investigators suggest that mechanisms other than innate immunity must be elicited in human hMPV infection to account for its clinical severity. These mechanisms might include direct epithelial damage, Th2 polarization leading to pulmonary airway hyperreactivity or chemokine-mediated inflammation.84 Evidence for Th2 polarization in hMPV infection includes significantly lower IFN-\u03b3/IL-4 ratios in secretions from infants infected with hMPV compared with influenza and RSV, suggesting a Th2 bias in the T-helper cell response to this pathogen.85 These investigators also report that compared with influenza, hMPV and RSV infection result in lower levels of IFN-\u03b3, IL-4, and IL-2 and that levels of cytokine production are not related to severity of illness for any of these viruses. These studies suggest that despite structures and clinical sequelae that are similar to other pathogens, innate immunity and inflammatory responses to hMPV are unique and not fully understood.",

However, Skiadopoulos and colleagues81 measured the cross-protective efficacy between types A and B hMPV in the hamster and nonhuman primate models and found that the hMPV types A and B are highly antigenically related and conferred significant cross-protection measured by viral replication in the respiratory tract, indicating that they do not represent distinct serotypes.
