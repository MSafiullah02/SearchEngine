In order to eradicate an infectious disease, a method of prevention with low social cost is the most effective way. While we wait for new therapies and a vaccine, we are proposing a solution based on the existing knowledge in biomedical sciences. Here we propose to use low doses of hydroxychloroquine (50-100 mg daily orally) and intranasal interferon alpha-2b (IFN \uf061-2b) spray (0.5 X 10 6 IU twice daily) for the prophylaxis of COVID-19. Although there are ongoing clinical trials to test the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine for prophylaxis, there has not been any proposal to test the efficacy of IFN \uf061-2b together with hydroxychloroquine to increase protection against COVID-19. Since the two act on two different mechanisms, we strongly believe that the two could have additive effects in prophylaxis against COVID-19. We recommend using a randomized control study to prove efficacy and safety.",

Bernstein analyzed all published cases and Food and Drug Administration reports of retinopathy induced by hydroxychloroquine. He concluded that there is no evidence of permanent visual-field scotomas occurring when the daily dose did not exceed 6.5 mg/kg body weight for maintenance therapy [17] .
