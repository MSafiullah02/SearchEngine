A clinical syndromic diagnosis of Legionnaires' disease was rendered, using the Winthrop-University Hospital Infectious Disease Division's diagnostic weighted point score system (modified).

Later, as the pandemic becomes widespread, clinical diagnoses are usually relatively straightforward.4, 11, 12 During the H1N1 pandemic in the New York area in spring and summer 2009, many unexpected diagnostic problems rapidly became apparent. Firstly, the human seasonal influenza season was unusually long, and extended into late spring and early summer. Other respiratory viruses were also circulating in the community at this time when the number of potential H1N1 cases increased. Diagnostic difficulties with testing were problematic. The rapid influenza A screening test (QuickVue A/B, Quidel, San Diego) was used to determine which ED-admitted patients needed influenza precautions and oseltamivir, and these tests were negative in 30% of cases.4, 13, 14 Because positive rapid influenza A testing predicted subsequent RT-PCR positivity for H1N1, no diagnostic or infection-control problems occurred with these patients. Admitted adults with ILIs and negative RIDTs, however, were problematic because most of these patients clinically had H1N1 pneumonia, but these cases could not be confirmed or ruled out by RT-PCR. Because the health department was overwhelmed with requests for RT-PCR, such testing was restricted.4\n",
