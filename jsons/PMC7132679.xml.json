These respirators were randomly selected from the pool of commercially available respirators at the time of those studies. Unused respirators from these projects were stored together for at least 6 years in dry warehouse facilities or for short periods of time in research laboratories (to account for the short time periods that the FFRs were not being stored in the warehouse facilities), ranging in temperature between 15\u00b0C and 32\u00b0C and relative humidity between 20% and 80%. The warehouse was heated but not air-conditioned. All respirators were stored in the original packaging and within cardboard boxes used for shipment. Purchase records were used to determine the purchase dates. If purchase records were not available, the purchase date was determined by the date of the NIOSH project. If the size of the respirator was not available from the purchase records, respirator packaging, or respirator labeling, it was labeled as \u201cone-size-fits-all.\u201d Table 1\nprovides the characteristics of the respirators, dates stamped on the original packaging, and the approximate dates of purchase.",

The TSI 8130 AFT delivers a solid polydisperse sodium chloride (NaCl) aerosol that meets the particle size distribution criteria set forth in 42 CFR 84 Subpart K, Section 84.181 for NIOSH certification.21 Filter resistance is measured using a combination of a flowmeter and 2 electronic pressure transducers that measure the pressure drop through the filter or filter media under test. The AFT uses a metal tube with an internal orifice. The flow passes upward through the flowmeter, and the pressure difference across the orifice is measured with the pressure transducers.
