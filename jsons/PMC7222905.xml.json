One study provided statistical analysis of improvement in admission serum glucose concentration to >50 mg/dL following protocol implementation [13]. Another described \u201cstable\u201d glucoses throughout the QI project [14]. The only other study that discussed glycemic control reported an increase in the rate of hypoglycemia which was attributed to increased physiologic stress [18]. Although long-term outcomes were not consistently evaluated in the studies, several authors described improvements in the incidence of IVH, ROP, CLD, late-onset sepsis, and/or length of stay in their units [8, 10, 12, 16, 18].",

With project implementation, a warming mattress was added and the technique for wrapping the infant in plastic was modified to improve integrity during resuscitation. One corner of the plastic was folded over the infant\u2019s head and secured with a stocking-knit cap, as plastic head-coverings have been shown to be more effective at preventing heat loss than use of stocking-knit caps alone [27]. In Phase II, the plastic wrap and stocking-knit cap were replaced by a polyethylene, heat loss prevention suit with a hood.

We noted that the percent of periviable infants remained stable across the first two cohorts and nearly doubled in the third cohort (16%, 16%, and 29% respectively). The inverse relationship between gestational age and survival without morbidities is well-recognized and confers a higher degree of vulnerability to those infants delivered at the \u201ccusp of viability\u201d [1, 34]. Periviable infants are more susceptible to hypothermia and hypoglycemia and less resilient from the ensuing morbidities [35]. Despite an increasing percentage of more immature infants, the rates of hypothermia and hypoglycemia improved without significant differences in balancing measures. This finding remained when balancing measures were evaluated separately for 22 and 23 week infants. We speculate that implementation of the interventions in our GH protocol may offer a protective effect which may be even more beneficial at lower gestational ages.",

Changes in practice over time and other confounding variables, not related to the interventions of the GH might contribute to variations in outcomes and in some instances, provide an alternative explanation of the study findings. Other NICUs may not have been exposed to the same changes in practice or confounding factors thus limiting the generalizability of the study. The study was a single-center QI project and the generalizability of the protocol is also limited as a result of potential differences in resources, staffing, and physical space.
