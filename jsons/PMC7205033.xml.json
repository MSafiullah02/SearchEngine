We use the protection motivation theory (PMT) [6] to identify intermediate constructs in between cyberchondria and information overload, and self-isolation intention. We theorized the relationships between these constructs based on previous studies (eg, [6,7]) and formulated a research model. To test the model, we used survey data from Finnish participants (N=225) and analyzed the data using partial least squares-structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). This was followed by a post hoc analysis regarding the impact of using social media as an information source and living alone. After presenting the results, we describe the theoretical and practical implications of our findings, followed by the limitations and future work. In the end, we provide our conclusions.",

As of the middle of April 2020, Johns Hopkins University had reported over 2,000,000 confirmed cases of patients with COVID-19 worldwide [10]. This number is estimated to be a lot higher, as several countries are not testing cases with mild symptoms [9].

The downsides include negative impacts on the economy and citizens\u2019 social well-being. Individuals are more motivated to comply with government-enforced measures and even adapt health measures themselves, if they understand the necessity and reasoning behind the actions [16,17]. A lack of clear communication during unusual, novel, and potentially lethal pandemic situations can lead to uncertainty and even panic among citizens [18]. Accordingly, during pandemics, intervention strategies and information bulletins aiming to propagate health information and knowledge are often used [19].",

The PMT explains individual-level behavioral responses in health-threatening situations [6]. At its core, the theory looks at motivational reasons for adopting protective measures and divides the causes into threat appraisal and coping appraisal. In the context of worldwide pandemics, threat appraisal refers to the individual\u2019s perception of the seriousness of the situation, as well as how vulnerable they see themselves and their friends to be in the situation [7,20]. On the other hand, coping appraisal refers to the individual\u2019s evaluation of how well they can manage in the given situation. Thus, coping appraisal can be further divided into response costs, self-efficacy, and response efficacy [7].",

The role of the internet in pandemic situations is arguably highly complex, as it contains a myriad of information sources and social media platforms through which people can not only acquire knowledge but communicate and share experiences as well. The internet has become the primary source of information for many, but there is a large variance in the preferred online information source. Search engines and social media platforms further complicate the matter with personalized content, which can contribute to some groups of people receiving better and more accurate information regarding the pandemic situation than others. Furthermore, although studies have been done on reactions to several kinds of epidemic situations [20], COVID-19 provides a completely new context, as a pandemic of similar magnitude and impact has not been seen in modern times. To address these research gaps, we looked at cyberchondria and information overload as internet-specific constructs, and, through the lens of PMT, measured how they affect both threat and coping appraisal and, through them, the intention to self-isolate.",

On the other hand, response efficacy refers to the perception of one\u2019s capability of being able to respond to the situation. For example, in the case of COVID-19, response efficacy consists of the ability to self-isolate at one\u2019s own will. Response cost is the individual\u2019s evaluation of the negative impact of specific responses. We focused primarily on the self-isolation intention, and thus, the response costs refer to what follows from self-isolation. This could mean in practice losing the opportunity to meet friends or go fishing, or even losing a job and, consequently, income. As the response costs are negative, they should have a strong negative influence on self-isolation intention. Accordingly, we postulated our final three hypotheses.",

Reliability is assessed with internal consistency and items reliability, whereas validity consists of the convergent and discriminant validity. Internal consistency has been traditionally measured using Cronbach alpha; however, composite reliability (CR) has been recommended as a suitable measure of reliability in PLS [42]. Therefore, we considered CR for assessing internal consistency. Item reliability was assessed from the item loadings. Convergent validity was ascertained from the average variance explained (AVE), and discriminant validity was assessed with the Fornell-Larcker criterion [43]. For this purpose, we followed the accepted thresholds recommended by previous studies [41,44].",

Interventions targeted to increase an individual\u2019s perceived severity to get them to act may unintentionally increase the cyberchondria of those who already perceive the situation to be grave, causing increased strain on people in an already unusual and stressful situation. Supplementing findings from previous studies (eg, [20]), we suggest personalized intervention strategies, where individuals suffering from cyberchondria are given reassuring and hopeful messages, and those with no intention to adopt health measures are targeted with communication that aims to increase their perceived severity of the situation.",

For example, it is possible that information overload was experienced more heavily at the beginning of the pandemic when the novelty and uncertainty of the situation were greater. Second, participants were selected from a geographically and socially limited area. During the data collection period, Finland had fewer than 1000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, and the country also has a relatively low population density. For increased reliability, our findings could be supplemented from data collected from other countries, especially those that have been hit hard by the pandemic. Third, we chose cyberchondria and information overload as examples of internet-fueled concepts; however, other constructs could have also been used in their place or in addition to them, such as the preference of trusted sources over social media and the impact of hearing experiences about the pandemic directly from people. Finally, in our post hoc analysis, we showed that social media users experienced significantly more cyberchondria and information overload compared to others, but the content on social media was not specified. Thus, future research could look into the specific types of social media behavior and content that contribute to the observed increase in cyberchondria and information overload.",

The significant influence of cyberchondria on perceived severity, which further leads to the self-isolation intention, also raises ethical concerns, as a seemingly negative phenomenon (cyberchondria) may be used to motivate people to adopt recommended health measures, in this case, self-isolation. Furthermore, it is possible that continuous behavior interventions aiming to get people to self-isolate may unintentionally fuel cyberchondria for those already worried. Accordingly, behavioral intervention campaigns aiming to get the entirety of the population to self-isolate voluntarily may, after a certain threshold, begin to cause more harm than good.",

The government-level quarantine and movement restrictions that were placed during the COVID-19 pandemic presented a novel research problem, which has not yet been studied, and that is how online information sources impact the adoption of recommended health behaviors during pandemics. In the case of Finland, during the time of the data collection, all participants had been ordered to work from home. This most likely translates to increased time spent on computers and online, which together with the novel and uncertain COVID-19 situation may likely have increased the amount of information read online related to the pandemic. As such, the quarantine measures may be effective at stopping the spread of the pandemic, but they may boost unhealthy internet behavior, most acutely, cyberchondria.",

To understand this effect, we used the PMT framework. Accordingly, we constructed a model where we measured the impact of information overload and cyberchondria on the coping and threat appraisal construct of PMT, and their subsequent relationship with the self-isolation intention. The results revealed perceived severity and self-efficacy to positively influence self-isolation intention, while response cost had a negative effect on it. Both cyberchondria and information overload were found to be higher among those who used social media as an information source. It follows from our findings that, although cyberchondria and information overload are generally regarded to be negative, during the COVID-19 pandemic they contributed to the adoption of recommended health behavior (self-isolation). The finding that using social media as an information source increases both cyberchondria and information overload invites further research into the impact of social media on human behavior during pandemics. Finally, our findings suggest that intervention strategies motivating people to adopt health measures should focus not only on stressing the severity of the situation but also on reducing information overload via the clear structuring and communication of reliable health information. This can help mitigate cyberchondria, which we showed may arise as a side effect of a severe worldwide pandemic such as COVID-19.",
