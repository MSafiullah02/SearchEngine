Binding of the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike (S) glycoprotein to dipeptidyl peptidase 4 is the critical step in MERS-CoV infection of a host cell. No vaccines or clinically applicable treatments are currently available for MERS-CoV. Therefore, rapid diagnosis is important for improving patient outcomes through prompt treatment and protection against viral outbreaks. In this study, the aim was to establish two ELISA systems for detecting antigens and antibodies against MERS-CoV. Using a recombinant full-length S protein, an indirect ELISA was developed and found to detect MERS-CoV-specific antibodies in animal sera and sera of patient with MERS. Moreover, MAbs were induced with the recombinant S protein and RBD and used for sandwich ELISA to detect the MERS-CoV S protein. Neither ELISA system exhibited significant intra-assay or inter-assay variation, indicating good reproducibility. Moreover, the inter-day precision and sensitivity were adequate for use as a diagnostic kit. Thus, these ELISAs can be used clinically to diagnose MERS-CoV.",

Fast and accurate diagnosis is therefore the most promising means of controlling MERS outbreaks. Traditionally, PRNT and/or microneutralization tests have been used as the gold standards for detecting MERS-CoV-specific antibodies. However, these tests are labor-intensive and time-consuming and require high-level biosafety facilities because they involve handling of live viruses (14, 24, 25) . Therefore, more convenient methods are required. Recently, a cELISA in which a labeled MAb competes with test serum antibodies for target epitopes was developed and compared with the PRNT assay; Pearson's correlation coefficients were reportedly 0.71-0.76 depending on the cELISA serum dilution (26) . Although this correlation is positive, there were considerable variations at the same PRNT titers (26) .",

We expressed the MERS-CoV S protein and RBD in recombinant baculovirus and E. coli systems, respectively. The indirect ELISA involved coating with recombinant full-length S protein, which specifically bound to antibodies in MERS patient sera, showing good linearity and reproducibility, as well as high precision and sensitivity. Therefore, the indirect ELISA developed in this study can be used clinically to detect MERS-specific antibodies in patient sera. In addition, we used serial dilutions of S protein-immunized rat sera to compare indirect ELISA titers with PRNT titers; human sera were not used because insufficient volumes of patient sera were available. However, we did not find a positive correlation between the two titers because of differences in the sensitivities of the two assays; specifically, a dilution of MERS-CoV antibody of over 1280-fold still showed a high titer in the indirect ELISA, whereas it was not detectable in the PRNT assay (data not shown). It should be noted that it is also possible that there were no neutralizing antibodies in the rat serum samples. Therefore, as stated in a previous report (26) , further studies are necessary to develop a cELISA using MERS-CoV S protein-derived MAbs in order to determine the correlation between the cELISA and PRNT, the latter currently being used clinically to diagnose MERS-CoV infection.",

We validated the assay with recombinant S protein and demonstrated good reproducibility, precision and sensitivity. Therefore, although we did not test whether the recombinant spike proteininduced mAb detects authentic MERS-CoV, this sandwich ELISA can be used clinically to detect the presence of MERS-CoV in biological samples from patients suspected of having MERS and in various contaminated materials. Recent studies have shown that qRT-PCR can also accurately detect the MERS-CoV genome in a variety of biological samples, even when there are extremely small amounts of the virus. Moreover, the biological hazard levels required for the devices and facilities capable of performing sandwich ELISA and real-time PCR are similar. Thus, sandwich ELISA offers no significant advantage over real-time PCR in a clinical setting. However, the sandwich ELISA developed in this study can directly detect and quantify MERS-CoV S protein. Given that most MERS-CoV vaccine candidates target the S protein because of its promise as a vaccine target (27) (28) (29) , the sandwich ELISA could be used for quality-control testing, such as measuring the antigen content of vaccine candidates, rather than detecting MERS-CoV in clinical settings.",
