This is achieved by simultaneously performing whole-exome sequencing (WES), RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq), and tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS)-based shotgun proteomics analysis on matched samples, producing customized, sample-specific protein databases from DNA, and/or RNA sequencing data, and then searching MS/MS data against the customized protein databases. In contrast to proteomics data analysis that relies on reference protein databases alone, this approach allows the identification of peptides not included in reference protein databases, providing new opportunities to improve protein-coding genome annotation4,5 and to identify disease-specific protein sequences6\u201313.",

To identify neoantigens for personalized vaccine development, WES of matched tumor- and normal-cell DNA from individual patients has been used to identify somatic mutations, followed by prioritization of mutated alleles by RNA-Seq profiling of the tumor and subsequent in silico prediction of the binding affinity between putative neoantigens and the major histocompatibility complex (MHC)15,16. Because MHC binds peptides rather than RNA molecules, validation of mutated alleles through proteomic profiling will likely provide more functionally and clinically relevant neoantigens for prioritization.",

            "text": "Successful application of the proteogenomic approach to neoantigen prioritization relies on sensitive and reliable identification of variant peptides in proteomics data. In proteomics data analysis using reference protein databases, quality control is critical and achieved by estimating false discovery rate (FDR) using the target-decoy strategy17. Directly applying this strategy to proteogenomic studies without discriminating reference and variant peptides would underestimate the true FDR for variant peptides because the likelihood of experimentally observing a variant peptide is lower than that of a reference peptide. Thus, this global FDR method is prone to false-positive variant peptide identifications3. To address this issue, two alternative FDR estimation methods have been proposed. The separate FDR method calculates FDRs for known and variant peptides separately18,19. The two-stage FDR method involves two stages: in the first stage, the MS/MS data are searched against a reference protein database, and the confidently identified spectra are removed; in the second stage, the remaining spectra are searched against the variant protein database, and the FDR for variant peptides is calculated based on the second stage search results20,21. The separate FDR and two-stage FDR methods calculate FDRs based on a small number of identifiable variant peptides, which may generate highly variable estimates. The two-stage FDR method is further vulnerable to false negatives because an MS/MS spectrum generated from a variant peptide may be incorrectly matched to a reference peptide in the first stage and excluded from the second stage analysis. Moreover, a common limitation for all three methods is that false positives may occur when a spectrum matched to a variant peptide is actually derived from a reference peptide containing a chemical or post-translational modification that was not considered in database searching.",

SAVControl provides site-level quality control of single amino-acid variant (SAV) peptide identifications. It relocates the mass shift responsible for a SAV to search for alternative interpretations. SpectrumAI is specifically designed to curate SAV peptide identifications using the ions flanking both sides of the substituted amino acid. PepQuery is a peptide-centric search engine for novel peptide validation, including SAV peptides and other types of novel peptides such as those derived from INDELs. For each peptide-spectrum match (PSM), a permutation p value is calculated based on randomly shuffled peptide sequences to evaluate the statistical significance of the PSM score. The peptide-centric analysis in PepQuery also allows comprehensive consideration of sequence modifications during the analysis. In general, all three tools can help reduce false positives, but they cannot rescue false negatives.",

            "text": "Applying different quality control strategies to the same proteomics data may result in different numbers of identified variant peptides, obscuring neoantigen prioritization and other downstream proteogenomic applications. Recent studies have compared different FDR estimation methods for novel peptide identification21,24,25. Li et al.24 and Ivanov et al.25 utilized spike-in data sets in which spiked-in proteins were considered as novel proteins. Sequences of spiked-in proteins are usually very different from those in the reference database. In contrast, most variant proteins identified in proteogenomic studies only involve very minor sequence changes compared with the reference sequences, such as SAVs. These minor sequence changes cannot be well-represented by spiked-in proteins. Moreover, existing studies have only evaluated different FDR estimation methods in label-free experiments, but many cancer proteogenomic studies involve isobaric labeling7,10,12. The conclusions from the label-free studies may not be generalizable to isobaric labeling-based experiments because of sample multiplexing. In addition, variant peptide validation tools introduced more recently were not included in these evaluation studies. Thus, despite the wide application of these approaches, there remains a lack of evidence-based consensus on the best bioinformatics strategy for controlling the quality of variant peptide identifications. A key challenge is the lack of an appropriate metric for systematic and unbiased performance evaluation.",

The label-free data set includes 90 colon tumor samples and a total of 16,804,000 MS/MS spectra.

Matched WES data of the tumor samples were used for customized database construction. For the label-free study, we built one customized database for each tumor sample. For the TMT and iTRAQ studies, we built one customized database for each TMT or iTRAQ experiment based on WES data of all individual tumor samples in the TMT 10-plex or iTRAQ 4-plex. For the purpose of method evaluation, we included both germline and somatic variants in the customized databases. We used three popular search engines, MS-GF+, X!Tandem, and Comet, for database searching, and FDR estimation was performed at the peptide level using three FDR estimation methods: global FDR, separate FDR, and two-stage FDR, all with a threshold of 1%. PepQuery was included as an optional step to validate the variant peptides that passed the FDR threshold. Variant peptides reported by different quality control strategies were evaluated based on the difference between observed RT and predicted RT, which was calculated using the AutoRT deep learning models as described below.",

Although the label-free and TMT experiments were performed on the same cohort of colon tumor specimens, we identified three- to fourfold more variant peptides in individual TMT experiments compared to individual label-free samples across all settings.

Using the difference between accurately predicted peptide RT and observed RT as a quantitative metric, we demonstrated that among all quality control strategies investigated, global FDR control followed by PepQuery validation offered the highest sensitivity while identifying high quality variant peptides. We thus recommend this quality control strategy for variant peptide identification and neoantigen prioritization in future proteogenomic studies. There is a large variation in the numbers of putative neoantigens reported by the three search engines; combining results from multiple search engines can effectively maximize putative neoantigen identifications. Moreover, RT-based validation provides an additional filter to reduce false positives.

Training a deep learning model without using hand-crafted features typically requires a large amount of data to achieve good performance. In most deep proteomics studies, multidimensional liquid chromatographic technologies are used. Each sample is separated into multiple fractions and each fraction of peptides is injected into a mass spectrometer for data acquisition. In our study, the number of identified peptides for a single run ranged from 700 to 10,000 (Fig. 2b\u2013d), which in general is not large enough to train a peptide sequence-based high-performance deep learning model from scratch. Thus, we developed base models using a large public data set and then used the transfer learning strategy to address the limitation of the small size of the run-specific training data. Combining data from multiple experiment types for training may be able to create a single model that can handle experiment-specific parameters; however, this cannot replace transfer learning because nonlinear RT shift between different runs occurs frequently even when the same LC system is used for all runs in a study (Supplementary Fig. 7). Another challenge is the design of the neural network architecture because the optimal architecture is not known a priori. We addressed this challenge by using evolutionary computation to automatically search for an optimal architecture.",

One of the most important features of PepQuery is competitive filtering based on unrestricted modification searching in which >1000 modifications are considered, which effectively addresses the common limitation of all FDR estimation methods.

This may be explained by different reasons such as inaccurate RT prediction and wide elution time range for some peptides, and false-variant peptide identification is also a possible explanation. Therefore, the RT errors included in the final report of NeoFlow provide orthogonal information that facilitates candidate prioritization for experimental validation. Rather than using RT errors as an optional feature to filter PSMs, a more-effective approach to improve peptide identification is to incorporate AutoRT-derived delta RT as a feature into PSM scoring in combination with other features. However, such implementation will require graphics processing units (GPUs) for PSM scoring, and thus will be more useful when GPUs are widely accessible in proteomics laboratories.",

Given that MS2 scans can sometimes be taken rather early or rather late in the peak elution, the RT of the MS1 peak maximum of the respective precursor ion can better represent the observed retention time for a peptide. However, the search results from the peptide identification tools used in this study (MS-GF+, X!Tandem, and Comet) do not contain the RT of the MS1 peak maximum of the respective precursor, and it is time consuming to extract MS1 peak maximum-based RT from the raw data for all experiments. We considered an alternative option, which is to use the average of RTs from all spectra identified from the same run with 1% FDR at both PSM and peptide levels for a peptide to represent observed RT for the peptide. To evaluate the accuracy of this MS2-based method, we selected identification results from three runs from each of the three CPTAC data sets and extracted the RT of MS1 peak maximum of the respective precursor ions of identified peptides using FlashLFQ (v1.0.2)56. As shown in Supplementary Figs. 8\u201310, the difference between the RTs estimated based on the MS2 and the MS1 methods was <10 sec for >90, 87, and 95% of the peptides identified in the label-free, TMT, and iTRAQ data, respectively. Moreover, the accuracies of AutoRT were similar when the two types of observed RTs were used for the analysis. Therefore, the average RT for all spectra identified from the same run for a peptide was used to determine the observed RT for a peptide.",

            "text": "The NeoFlow for neoantigen prediction and prioritization includes four modules: (1) variant annotation and customized database construction. Variants in the VCF format are annotated using ANNOVAR, and the annotated files are used as input to customProDBJ in order to build a customized protein database; (2) Variant peptide identification including MS/MS searching, FDR estimation, PepQuery validation, and optional RT-based validation. Three search engines, MS-GF+, X!Tandem, and Comet, are available in NeoFlow for peptide identification. FDR estimation is performed based on the global FDR estimation method. All variant peptides passing the 1% global FDR threshold are further validated using PepQuery, and only those with PepQuery p value \u22640.01 are retained. In addition, if germline variants are considered in the customized database construction, a somatic variant peptide will be removed if it can be exactly mapped to a germline variant peptide. For RT-based validation, an RT prediction model is trained for each single run using all identified reference peptides as training data for AutoRT. The trained model is then used to predict the RTs of the variant peptides. The difference between observed RT and predicted RT is taken as an additional quality metric for each PSM. Because AutoRT requires GPUs that are not available in many proteomics labs, this feature is optional in NeoFlow; (3) HLA typing. Because HLA-peptide binding affinity is affected by both peptide sequence and HLA type, HLA type needs to be specified as an input for binding affinity prediction in step 4. HLA typing in NeoFlow is performed by Optitype, which uses WXS data in the FASTQ format as input; (4) MHC-binding prediction and neoantigen prioritization. netMHCpan58 is used to predict HLA-peptide binding affinity for all somatic mutation-derived variant peptides with a length between 8\u201311 amino acids, except for those that can be exactly matched to a reference protein. Following previous publications15,59, NeoFlow uses IC50 binding affinity of 150 nm as a threshold to identify HLA-peptide pairs with strong binding affinity. This information is combined with variant peptide identification information acquired from steps 1\u20133 for neoantigen prioritization. NeoFlow was implemented into a workflow using nextflow (https://www.nextflow.io/)60 and is available at https://github.com/bzhanglab/neoflow.",

The MS/MS data for the five samples were downloaded from PRIDE with accession number PXD004894. The raw MS/MS data were converted into MGF files using MSconvert (ProteoWizard, version 3.0.19014). We directly used the HLA types reported for the five samples in the original study. The somatic variants of the five samples reported in the original study were extracted from the Supplementary Data 5 of the publication. We used NeoFlow to annotate these somatic variants and build a customized protein database for each sample. The three search engines MS-GF+, X!Tandem, and Comet were used for MS/MS searching. The search parameters were similar to those used in the original publication. The search results were filtered with 1% FDR using the global FDR estimation method. The retained somatic peptides were further validated using PepQuery. In order to speed up PepQuery-based validation of variant peptides in immunopeptidomics data, we updated PepQuery to make use of the matched peptides for each spectra identified by Open-pFind61. Specifically, we searched the MS/MS data against the reference protein database using Open-pFind with the open search mode. Then in the steps of competitive filtering based on reference sequences and competitive filtering based on unrestricted post-translational modification searching in PepQuery, we directly used the matched peptides for each spectrum from Open-pFind search as candidates. AutoRT was used to predict RT for identified variant peptides in order to calculate RT errors for additional PSM filtering.",
