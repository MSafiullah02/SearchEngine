We recast this problem in terms of mathematical optimization, i.e. by finding the amount of control signal that, when subtracted from an amplification curve, minimizes background noise. We demonstrate that this approach can yield a decade improvement in sensitivity relative to standard approaches, especially for data exhibiting late-cycle amplification. Critically, this increased sensitivity and accuracy promises more effective screening of viral DNA and a reduction in the rate of false-negatives in diagnostic settings.",

Typical approaches rely on local, empirical fits of the amplification curves at low cycle numbers n \u2264 15, i.e. before the onset of exponential growth. One assumes that this local behavior can be extrapolated to high cycle numbers to model the global background structure. However, it is well known that empirically motivated extrapolation can introduce significant errors, especially when data are fit with polynomials [4] . Moreover, it is unreasonable to assume that baseline corrections so extracted will be valid for high-cycle numbers (e.g. n \u2265 35). In this region, exquisite accuracy is needed to detect low initial template concentrations, and poor baseline subtraction will confound interpretation of measurements.

The main idea of our approach is to postulate that the measurement signal is a linear combination of fluorescence due to DNA reporters and an unknown amount of extraction-blank (EB) signal. We directly estimate the contribution of the latter by determining the amount that, when subtracted from the measured signal, minimizes the background noise. We show that this approach yields up to a decade improvement in sensitivity relative to approaches based on linear fits, especially for amplification curves that only show growth at late cycles.

Component B was diluted by adding 8.65 \u00b5L of DNA to 91.35 \u00b5L of TE \u22124 . From the initial 10fold dilution, additional serial dilutions were performed down to 0.0024 pg into a regime to produce samples with high C q values (> 35). The concentration values targeted were determined empirically though the analysis of previous dilution data (not shown) and ranged from approximately 100 pg to 0.0024 pg, with an expectation that the 100 pg datapoint would fall between 28 and 29 C q . These two components were chosen due to Component A being male and Component B being female. The qPCR chemistry used for these experiments is a chemistry which employs a Y-chromosomal target, which should amplify for Component A (male), but not for Component B (female), thereby permitting additional verification that the EBs are a reasonable proxy for baseline behavior.
