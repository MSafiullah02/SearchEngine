The purpose of this article is to share early learnings from the west coast of the United States, where the first U.S case was cared for. In this article, I describe the emerging principles allowing us to respond to an unprecedented crisis: Prevent, Protect, and Control. By the time this crisis is over, I do not doubt that we will have additional science and experience to support our frontline nurses and our nurse leaders. That said, I felt it was important to share our expertise in real-time for others to benefit from. I would also point out that writing about what you are feeling is cathartic-I encourage my colleagues to join me in writing about what you are experiencing.",

According to Johns Hopkins University 1 , as of March 22 nd , 2020, since January, 15th 2020, the virus has now spread to at least 33,200 individuals in the United States, killing at least 380. (I know those numbers have dramatically increased by the time you read this.) By mid-February, I was getting nervous about the possibility that this disease would make its way to Southern California, eating away our precious world as we knew it then. All of the following is representative of where I am in the process on March 22, 2020. I hope the messages are replaced with greater hope and positive outcomes than those presented here.",

That said, I feel as if I am in the process of building a plane, while I am flying it. We must focus our efforts on preventing the disease from spreading any further. At the very least, we need to slow it down so that we do not overburden our infrastructure. This requires a constant reminder to our community members and ourselves about the importance of practicing physical distancing (avoid social gatherings), washing hands, avoiding discretionary travel, staying home if you are sick, and refraining from visiting anyone in a nursing home or hospital. 2 I am optimistic that you have access to a virtual platform where you can guide individuals to access virtual care. This will decrease the foot traffic as well as keep potentially infected people away from your hospital or clinic. We noticed that it was extremely important to immediately divert as much traffic away from our traditional emergency room as possible.

To that end, you should review your list of the non-urgent elective procedures and re-schedule at a later time. This action will decrease your use of indispensable material. Access to all procedural areas should be limited to mission-critical personnel only. No vendors should be allowed in the procedural areas (unless they are required for the procedure), and no students should be allowed either. Access to all isolation rooms should be restricted only to those actually caring for the patients. This restriction means no \"grand rounds\" in the room, no visitors and, again, no students. Because patients in isolation can feel confined, consider providing devices that will enable ongoing communication such as baby monitors, smartphones, tablets, etc.",
