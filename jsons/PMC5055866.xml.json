            "text": "Previous studies have reported that HBV expression is correlated with autophagy induction[1-3]. HBV enhances and uses autophagy for its replication via the HBx protein, which binds and activates phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase class 3 (PIK3C3), an enzyme important for the initiation of autophagy. Autophagy inhibitors or the silencing of enzymes essential for the formation of autophagosomes suppresses HBV DNA synthesis with a minimal effect on the HBV mRNA levels[2]. The role of autophagy in the production of HBV virions was demonstrated in HBV transgenic mice with a liver-specific deficiency of Atg5[4]. We recently confirmed that ATG12 knock down reduced HBV DNA levels in HepG2.2.15 cells and induced the interferon signaling pathway, suggesting that autophagy machinery may aid HBV survival by reducing antiviral innate immunity[5].",

The monoallelic deletion of Beclin-1 at chromosome 17q21 is sporadically observed in approximately 75% of ovarian cancers[6,7], 50% of breast cancers[8], and 40% of prostate cancers[9]. Other mutations in autophagy genes such as Atg5, Atg12, Atg9B are frequent in gastric and colon cancers[10]. UVRAG, a Beclin1-interacting protein[10,11] and Atg4C were also shown to suppress tumor gene activity[12]. Liver-specific Beclin-1 knockout heterozygous mice showed increased rates of hepatocellular carcinoma in old aged mice[13,14]. Furthermore, mosaic Atg5-/- mice developed benign liver tumors at 6-mo of age[15] and Atg7 hepatocyte-specific knockout mice also developed liver tumors later in life[15]. These data support the idea that autophagy defects contribute to tumorigenesis.",

            "text": "However, autophagy deficient cells can occur via cellular damage caused by dysfunctional mitochondria, oxidative stress, endoplasmic reticulum stress, necrosis and p62 accumulation[16]. The accumulation of cell damage can lead to chromosome instability[17] and inflammatory responses[18], resulting in tumor development. Although, autophagy functions as a tumor suppressor in primary cells, it is important for cancer cell survival. Interestingly, spontaneously occurring liver tumors did not progress in chimeric mice with Atg5 or Atg7 loss[15]. This finding implies that autophagy is required for tumor progression. Additionally, autophagy is required for cancer progression of other types of cancers. For example, an Atg3 deletion in hematopoietic cells prevents BCR-Abl-mediated leukemia[19]. Some tumor cells are susceptible to growth inhibition or death when autophagy is inhibited. Guo et al[20], found that Ras-driven tumors required autophagy for tumor cell survival upon starvation. Therefore, autophagy has a dual-function in cancer. It functions as a tumor suppressor during cancer initiation, but also functions to promote tumor progression and metastasis later in the development process.",

Gamma-secretase inhibitors, also known as N-[N-(3,5-difluorophenacetyl)-L-alanyl]-S-phenylglycine t-butyl ester; DAPT, is used to block the Notch pathway[23]. When using DAPT combined with gene silencing of ATG12 under starvation conditions, HepG2 cell apoptosis was increased from 38.5% to 48.3%, compared to DAPT treatment alone, although there was no synergistic effect (Figure 6). Interestingly, the combination blockade of DAPT and ATG12 gave the opposite result by decreasing the apoptosis rate in HepG2.2.15 from 55.6% to 50.4% (Figure 6). No significant changes in cell cycle progression were observed for the combination treatment of ATG12 siRNA and DAPT (Figure 7).

We showed that silencing of ATG12, which represented the elimination of the ATG5-ATG12 complex, increased cell apoptosis under starvation conditions in HepG2.2.15 but not in HepG2. These results suggested that ATG5-ATG12 is important for the survival of HBV-associated HCC during states of limited tumor nutrients. A previous study by Mao et al[33] showed that HepG2.2.15 cells have a higher survival rate than HepG2 cells after culturing in a starvation medium for 48 h. Cell death was reduced through activation of the autophagy pathway. However, our study did not show any significant difference between the rate of cell death for HepG2 and HepG2.2.15 after starvation for 4 h. This might be explained by our shorter starvation time. The inhibition of autophagy-induced liver cancer cell apoptosis under starvation conditions was reported by Chang et al[34] They showed that HepG2 and HuH6 induced autophagy (Beclin-1, ATG5 and LC3B expression) for cell survival under starvation conditions with serum-free medium or chemotherapy. The inhibition of autophagy via the silencing of autophagic genes (Beclin-1 and ATG5) or 3-MA treatment induced HuH6 cell apoptosis under starvation conditions[34]. A study by Liu et al[35] demonstrated that starvation with serum-free medium for 48 h induced autophagy and apoptosis in 7702, HepG2, Hep3B and Huh7 cell lines; however, the inhibition of autophagy via Bafilomycin A1 was not affected in HepG2 apoptosis under starvation conditions similar to our result. These results imply that targeting the inhibition of autophagy might have different effects depending on the cell type and various metabolic stress conditions present.",

ATG12 and other autophagic proteins (LC3 and ATG5) are associated with mitochondrial quality control of human umbilical vein endothelial cells. ATG12, ATG5 and LC3B were up-regulated after mitochondrial damage, leading to increased anti-apoptotic effects and increased life span in an in vitro aging model[38].

In this study, we examined apoptosis cell death after the inhibition of ATG12 in combination with Notch signaling in HepG2 and HepG2.2.15 cell lines. The combination treatment increased cell apoptosis in HepG2 cells. However, when we blocked both Notch signaling and ATG12 under starvation conditions, cell apoptosis did not increase. There appears to be some interaction between ATG12 and Notch signaling, specifically in HepG2.2.12, because the Notch inhibitor DAPT caused the down-regulation of ATG12 mRNA but this was not observed in HepG2. In addition, the inhibition of ATG12 impaired Notch activation in HepG2.2.15 but increased Notch activation in HepG2.",

Both autophagy and Notch signaling are highly conserved signaling pathways in eukaryotic cells. The core Notch signaling pathway is through the binding of Notch ligand to Notch receptor which induces two proteolytic cleavages, metalloprotease and \u03b3-secretase, to release the Notch intracellular domain, which translocates to the nucleus and binds to DNA to regulate the transcription of target genes[42]. The Notch pathway is associated with both tumor suppression and tumorigenesis in HCC[43,44]. The connection of autophagy and Notch signaling was demonstrated in Drosophila where the ATG4 mutation enhanced the notched-wing phenotype resulting in defective Notch signaling[45]. In contrast, the overexpression of ATG1 enhanced the notched-wing phenotype[46], suggesting that some autophagic proteins have additional functions independent of autophagy that are related to the enhancement or suppression of Notch signaling.",

Moreover, this study demonstrated that autophagy is related to HBV-associated cell death responses. Atg12 silenced HepG2.2.15 showed increased apoptosis under starvation conditions. The function of Atg12 seems to be dominated in HBV-associated HCC. These results suggested that ATG5-ATG12 is important for the survival of HBV-associated HCC during states of limited tumor nutrients. However, as mentioned previously that autophagy has a dual-function in cancer. Despite its role as tumor promotion in the later phase, it can act as a tumor suppressor during cancer initiation. Therefore, the therapeutic intervention that target autophagy has to take this information into consideration too. Moreover, our result showed that the use of autophagy inhibition in combination with other anti-tumor therapies such as Notch inhibitor, might not be a good strategy. Further characterization of HBV and Notch related autophagy is needed.",
