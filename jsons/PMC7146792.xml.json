One ferret had a serous abdominal effusion. Microscopic findings included pyogranulomatous inflammation involving especially the visceral peritoneum, mesenteric adipose tissue, liver, lungs, kidneys, lymph nodes, spleen, pancreas, adrenal glands, or blood vessels, or a combination of tissues. All cases were immunohistochemically positive for coronavirus antigen using an FIP monoclonal antibody. Electron microscopic examination of inflammatory lesions identified particles with coronavirus morphology in the cytoplasm of macrophages. Partial sequencing of the coronavirus spike gene obtained from frozen tissue indicates that the virus is related to ferret enteric coronavirus.",

Younger ferrets typically recover with supportive therapy, while older, immunosuppressed animals often succumb. A number of researchers are now recognizing a systemic disease syndrome linked to a virus related to ferret enteric coronavirus. This disease resembles FIP, and is characterized by anorexia, weight loss, diarrhea, and large palpable intra-abdominal masses. Other less frequent findings reported are hind limb paresis and central nervous system disease. Gross findings include white nodules present in multiple tissues including liver, kidney, spleen, and lungs. Of 23 ferrets with FIP-like lesions submitted for examination from Europe and the United States, all were positive for coronavirus antigen, and particles consistent with coronavirus were identified via electron microscopy of various tissues. The coronavirus initiating the lesions appears to be ferret enteric coronavirus. (AML)",
