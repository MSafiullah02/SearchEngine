The first outbreak was characterized by a sudden onset of abdominal distension and some diarrhoea in 6\u201314-week old rabbits (Licois et al., 1998). Gross lesions included dilatation of the stomach and the small intestine with mainly liquid contents. The caecum was either impacted or contained liquid, and mucus was occasionally present in the colon (Licois and Coudert, 1999). Subsequently, these pathological lesions systematically appeared in other batches of rabbits showing similar clinical signs of ERE. Definitive diagnosis can however be difficult, and although it is based on the observation of the characteristic lesions, these can be modified by supervening secondary bacterial infections (Licois et al., 1998, Marlier and Vindevogel, 1998).",

Caecal contents from two rabbits that died at six (B1 inoculum) weeks of age or from one rabbit that died at seven weeks of age (B2 inoculum) were diluted at 1:3 in sterile water, grossly filtered at 0.5 mm and centrifuged at 1000g for 15 min. The supernatant was used as inoculum. This treatment did not remove viruses or bacteria but it eliminated coccidia (Licois and Coudert, 2001). The reference French inoculum (TEC3) described by Licois and Coudert (2001) was also used as a control. Before use, the inocula were submitted to bacteriological, virological and parasitical examinations as previously described.",

Indeed, the demonstration from the start: (1) that the TEC3 inoculum was totally E. coli-free and, (2) that the ERE was fully reproduced by inoculation with TEC3 demonstrated that E. coli was not the aetiological agent of ERE (Licois et al., 2005). So analysis conducted on E. coli strains were done specifically to avoid misdiagnosis. In rabbits, epizootics of colibacillosis are characterized by infection with attaching-effacing E. coli strains (for a review see Wales et al., 2005) that rarely produce enterotoxins or verotoxins (Pohl et al., 1993, Blanco et al., 1997).

            "text": "Also, high Cl. perfringens faecal counts were detected in the digestive contents of 80% of the ERE field cases. This bacterial species is sometimes found in healthy animals including rabbits (Lee et al., 1991) but is usually considered one of the most widely occurring pathogenic bacteria and the first cause of clostridial enteric disease in animals (Songer, 1996). Cl. perfringens strains can be classified into five toxinotypes A to E on the basis of the production of one or more of the four major toxins (\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b5 and \u03b9) (Cato et al., 1986, Petit et al., 1999). In the present study, only strains from toxinotypes A and C were found. The interpretation of this finding in rabbits is difficult since these toxinotypes are considered primary pathogens in necrotic enteritis only of poultry. The apparent correlation between the presence of ERE gross lesions and detection of Cl. perfringens alpha toxin in the digestive contents of affected rabbits should not be misread. Indeed in experimentally induced ERE, high Cl. perfringens counts are only observed in 1/10 animals and in 1/5 control animals (D. Marlier and H. Vindevogel, unpublished data). Thus, both the high E. coli and Cl. perfringens faecal counts and putative links between the alpha toxin and gross lesions might well reflect the intestinal disorders only, without being the cause.",

Some viruses (adenovirus, coronavirus, parvovirus and rotavirus) have been found in the digestive contents of rabbits that died of digestive disorders (Nieddu et al., 2000, Baker, 1998). By electron microscopy, the presence of viral particles has been found in 37.3% of samples from rabbits suffering from intestinal disorders with the most frequent viral species being rotavirus (41.9%), coronavirus (25.6%), parvovirus (21.1%) and enterovirus (10.3%) (Nieddu et al., 2000). Among these, only rotavirus could be a primary pathogen (Thouless et al., 1988). Rotaviruses are endemic in most rabbitries in which they only induce mild digestive disorders unless complicated by supervening bacterial infections (Thouless et al., 1996). Rotaviruses do not seem to be the cause of ERE since they were only detected in 33% of rabbits naturally infected by ERE. The hypothesis that another viral family may be involved cannot be rejected.",

Subclinical infections with coccidia of the genus Eimeria frequently occur in rabbits (Peeters et al., 1984); furthermore, there is a marked variation in the pathogenicity among the different species of intestinal coccidia (Varga, 1982). In the present study, no Cryptosporidium oocysts were observed. In Belgium, oocysts were detected in 2\u201311% of weaned diarrhoeic rabbits. Inoculation of weaned rabbits causes no mortality and only very discrete diarrhoea was induced (Peeters et al., 1986). In any case, the direct intervention of Cryptosproridium spp. in the aetiology of ERE seems unreliable since the aetiological agent is able to withstand at least two unprotected freeze-thawing cycles without lost of infectivity (D. Marlier and H. Vindevogel, unpublished data), a process that would kill Cryptosporidium oocysts (Tzipori, 1983).",

Indeed, from the start it was evident that in such cases the potentially specific lesions induced by the putative ERE aetiological agents were hidden by unspecific lesions due to secondary bacterial infections developing during the course of ERE (D. Marlier and H. Vindevogel, unpublished data). Tissues of the gut are very susceptible to post mortem desquamation of the epithelium, making a correct diagnosis very tricky. Wyers (2003) studied the microscopic lesions in SPF inoculated rabbits and confirmed the lack of inflammatory lesions but failed to identify any specific lesions of ERE. This was also the case in the histopathological sections from the ten inoculated-rabbits we analysed. Since only photonic microscopy was used, we performed a study dedicated to the comparison of the microscopical lesions in sections from the different parts of the intestinal tract by light microscopy (specific staining for intracellular organisms), scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy (D. Marlier, unpublished data). The presence of bacteria either adhering to the epithelial surface or within epithelial cells was observed in some animals by transmission electron microscopy (rods with an undulating outer membrane about 1500 nm in long and 700 nm in width) and by light microscopy following Warthin\u2013Starry staining. These bacteria are supposed to be uncultivable. An aetiological role, if any, for these bacteria in ERE remains to be demonstrated.",

A possible explanation could be a greater number of freezing-thawing cycles undergone by B1 and B2 leading to a loss of virulence. The mortality rate observed in SPF rabbits (15\u201333%) was lower than in naturally infected animals (30\u201380%) (Licois, 1998), which suggests that secondary infection plays a key role in the field. The disease was not reproduced with the different pools of bacterial strains and the measured DWG remained high in the different groups.
