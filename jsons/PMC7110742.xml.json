If an intervention reduces cases in the community, then the risk to others goes down. Reduce them enough, and the infection will be eliminated and will not return unless reintroduced. Even then, it will not be able to spread unless there are sufficient susceptible individuals. Maintaining vaccination\u2014which reduces susceptibility\u2014at sufficiently high coverage (though crucially not necessarily 100%) can permanently prevent infection from spreading [7]. Thus, there are population-level effects in addition to those accruing to individuals and caregivers reached by the program. This is not so for noncommunicable diseases. For example, reducing the prevalence of heart disease makes no difference to the heart disease risk in others. If every case is treated, new cases still arise, and the overall health benefits can be estimated by summing the individual benefits. Many commonly used decision-analytic models, such as Markov models, ignore the indirect effects that arise from averted infections, whereas dynamic transmission models provide a tool to model such externalities.",

In a recent review of cost-effectiveness studies of vaccination programs, only 11% of 208 studies used an approach that could incorporate these indirect (as well as direct) effects [9]. Others have reported similar findings for other interventions against communicable diseases, including mass screening and treatment programs for chlamydia [10]. Most analysts have simply adapted the same class of model used for noncommunicable diseases, ignoring this fundamental property of communicable disease control programs. Hence, comparison across economic analyses is more difficult because results may be very sensitive to the underlying model structure. Clearly then, there is a need for specific guidance in this field.",

By contrast, severe acute respiratory syndrome had an R0 of approximately 3 (in health care settings), and everyone was susceptible. That is, each case generated on average three other cases, and each of these would be expected to generate an average of three further cases, and so on, leading to an exponentially increasing epidemic [15]. The basic reproduction number also gives an indication of the ease of controlling an infection. It is obvious that there is no need for further control measures for malaria in northern Europe. Severe acute respiratory syndrome, on the other hand, required stringent control measures for a large epidemic to be averted.",

When coverage exceeds a critical threshold (V\nc), disease is eliminated, as too few susceptible persons remain to ensure transmission. Infectious individuals will (on average) cause less than one new infection before recovering, as most contacts will be with immune individuals. As an epidemic does not occur, unvaccinated individuals experience a low infection risk. In a homogeneously mixing population (one in which all individual are equally likely to have contact with all other individuals and there are no preferences), for herd immunity to occur, V\nc has to be greater than 1 \u2212 1/R\n0\n[11], [12].

Not taking these into account may lead to overly pessimistic cost-effectiveness ratios. Indirect effects may also mean that the group optimally targeted is not the one that experiences the greatest disease burden but that which contributes most to the force of infection (e.g., dynamic models, but not static models, may show that immunizing younger individuals is the best means of preventing influenza-related mortality in older individuals [24]).

Reducing infection risk in susceptible individuals increases the average age at which they become infected [11], [12], and for many diseases, this increases complication risk and mortality (e.g., hepatitis A and varicella [25], [26]). Older age at infection may also result in a higher likelihood of infection during pregnancy, with potentially devastating complications for newborns [27]; (e.g., several countries have seen paradoxical increases in congenital rubella resulting from partial coverage with rubella vaccine, with concomitant increase in age at first infection [28], [29]). Complex relationships may also exist between disease incidence, latent infections, and immunity in older individuals for such infections as varicella; here, vaccine programs that result in less \u201cboosting\u201d as a result of childhood infections may lead to surges in reactivated infection (\u201cshingles\u201d) in older individuals [30], [31]. Reduced force of infection may also result in more widely spaced epidemics, which may itself have economic value, especially when future health costs and effects are discounted [12]. Such spacing may also complicate capacity planning. None of these phenomena is readily captured via static models. In such circumstances, dynamic models are essential.",

Static models cannot adequately take into account herd immunity or age distribution shifts. Risk of infection in susceptible individuals is constant in static models, while in dynamic models, it is a function of the proportion of the population infected (which changes over time). Hence, when intervention uptake is very low (e.g., low vaccine coverage) or is targeted at groups that do not have an impact on overall transmission, or does not prevent circulation of the pathogen, static and dynamic models produce similar results [7], [32].",

Some changes in the force of infection may also be caused by changing risk behaviors in the population when perceiving a higher risk during an outbreak. By taking into account these changes, dynamic models can 1) produce nonlinear dynamics, 2) predict higher number of cases prevented, and 3) predict changes in morbidity and mortality due to age shifts. Type-specific dynamic transmission models are necessary when interventions can induce selective pressures that cause a subset of pathogen types, or even other microbes, to gain a competitive advantage [16], [33] (e.g., type replacement following vaccination [16], [34], [35] and antimicrobial resistance [33], [36]). Dynamic models must be used when decision makers are interested in local elimination of an infectious disease, or eradication (i.e., global elimination) [32]. This is possible only, without reaching everyone, with nonlinear (herd) effects. Finally, if reinfection of treated individuals depends on the prevalence of the infection in the population, as is the case in many sexually transmitted infections, dynamic models are required [22].",

Deterministic compartmental models are useful for modeling the average behavior of disease epidemics in large populations. When stochastic effects (e.g., extinction of disease in small populations), complex interactions between behavior and disease, or distinctly nonrandom mixing patterns (e.g., movement of disease on networks) are important, stochastic agent-based approaches may be preferred.

For example, vaccinating an individual today might prevent infection transmission several years later; individuals not infected later would accrue benefits for the remainder of their lives and also potentially not infect others, who would accrue benefits for the remainder of their lives. Consistent with the rationale for using a lifetime horizon, the time horizon should be long enough to capture all the effects of the intervention. Although an infinite horizon could be used to capture all these effects, such an approach may not be useful or realistic for decision making. In some cases, it is sufficient to use the lifetime of the first vaccinated cohort. In other cases, infinite time horizons can give results different from those obtained by using long fixed time horizons (e.g. 75 or 100 years) [44]. Fixed time horizons can produce artifacts (e.g., the benefits to a cohort vaccinated just before the time horizon end will not be included in the cost-effectiveness estimate, though the vaccination costs will).",

A decision not to include a specific variable or structure may alter results. Structural uncertainty is often ignored, despite evidence that it can have a much greater impact on results than parameter uncertainty [7], [8], [39], [47]. Often, not enough is known about a system's biological properties for precise definition of functional relationships; alternatively, several approaches may be possible to derive a model framework for a biological process. It is particularly important to consider structural uncertainty in dynamic models as it can be extremely influential because of nonlinear feedback effects, leading to qualitatively different dynamic regimes [39], [48], [49].",

A small shift in parameter values may move from one dynamic regime to another (e.g., transition from a disease-free state to an endemic equilibrium near R\n0 of 1, where small changes in parameter values can cause large changes in prevalence). Several models have evaluated nonlinear, and \u201ccatastrophic\u201d (for the pathogen), effects of interventions for hepatitis B virus and pertussis [49], [51].

The severity of many communicable diseases of public health importance is extremely variable, and surveillance systems may capture information only on those with symptoms sufficiently severe to warrant presentation for medical care and diagnostic testing. This also complicates the estimation of infection transmissibility. Thus, modeling natural history from surveillance data likely underestimates disease incidence and overestimates severity, hospitalization, and case-fatality. For many communicable diseases, there is also a disconnect between severity and effective infectiousness as more symptomatic individuals may modify their behavior in a way that reduces transmissibility. Thus, transmission by minimally symptomatic individuals may represent a significant problem for control [52]. Serological studies may be used to overcome some of these challenges as antibody responses to infection provide a relatively durable past infection record, provided that seroconversion reliably occurs on infection. Seroprevalence curves can be used to estimate incidence among uninfected individuals according to age, sex, and other characteristics [8], [53].",

When individual randomization is used, intervention effectiveness will be underestimated because indirect effects will not be captured since clinical trials usually incorporate a tiny fraction of the population and, thus, neither control nor intervention arms experience a reduced force of infection. Trials often do not assess hard end points but rather differences in immune responses, forcing models to extrapolate to mortality and serious morbidity.\n\u2022Identification and synthesis of parameter values from published literature Identification of parameter values for modeling communicable diseases present some issues. Observational outbreak studies are more likely to be submitted for publication if they are large or costly, biasing reproductive numbers and outbreak sizes upward. Communicable disease dynamics differ across populations because of heterogeneity in geography and climate, socioeconomic status, genetics, demography, and availability of control interventions. Thus, data synthesis across multiple studies should be used with caution and prudently to construct plausible ranges or relatively flat priors, rather than parametric distributions, for stochastic simulation or sensitivity analyses.\n\u2022Calibration and refinement of parameter estimates Given the complexities of accurate parameter estimation, model calibration is important. Some authors have recognized the importance of identifiability [57]). It may force reestimation of uncertain or implausible parameters and may be used to generate plausible values when empirical estimates are unavailable. Furthermore, reproducing observed disease incidence, trends, or natural history helps establish a model's credibility with decision makers.",

It may be challenging or inappropriate to perform this type of analysis with dynamic transmission models. In dynamic transmission models, many of the parameters related to mixing and transmission are correlated and these correlations need to be preserved to ensure sensible models and reasonable fit to data. Depending on the method of parameterizing the models, however, the correlations may not be known. If extensive data are available, it may be possible to conduct probabilistic sensitivity analysis on dynamic models (e.g., [44]), but this is not the norm.

Many of these packages contain graphical user interfaces to allow rapid development and enhance communication, and most have multiple calculation options for numerical procedures. However, the modeling environments may prevent users from implementing some desired modeling assumptions. Thus, many analysts prefer to produce their own custom code in Matlab, R, C/C++, or other programming environments. This allows the greatest flexibility in terms of modeling assumptions, model calibration, uncertainty analysis, and choice of numerical techniques. However, this approach requires the most development effort, and the programs may lack transparency to those not familiar with these environments.",
