However, the agility inherent to 3D printing technologies means that the same input file can be the starting point for almost infinite variations in structural and material composition. This level of variability is detrimental and becomes a risk factor when the product is used as a barrier to an infectious pathogen. Thus, our ability to rapidly respond to the current supply chain crisis -whether through commercial manufacturers or individual Makers -is dependent on determining not just what we should be producing and for whom, but also how we should produce it.",

Often labeled erroneously as N95 masks, although their quality is not high enough for them to be categorized as such, these home-made masks are 3D-printed models with an integrated filter medium. The quality of the masks can be assessed based on two factors: the fit to the user's face and the type of material used as the filter. In most of these masks, the role of the 3D component is creating an air-tight seal between the airway of the user and the filter material. As such, all of these models are judged based on their ability to conform to the user's face to create a seal, their ability to secure the filter material, and their impedance to air flow.",

The conventional disinfection strategy includes a chemical treatment to remove any gross contaminants and then a secondary thermal, chemical vapor, or irradiation treatment to remove any remaining microscopic or nanoscopic materials. However, the conventional autoclave-style thermal treatment degrades some of the less robust plastic materials, and can degrade fiber-based structures. This limit forces medical facilities to rely on irradiation and chemical vapor methods, which are newer techniques and are not commonly found in smaller clinics.
