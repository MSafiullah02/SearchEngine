This devastating viral infection has stimulated 28 the urgent development of viable vaccine against COVID-19 across the research institutes 29 around the globe. The World Health Organization (WHO) has also confirmed that the recent 30 pandemic is causing Public Health Emergency of International apprehension. Moreover, the 31 earlier two pathogenic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and many others yet to be identified pose 32 a universal menace. Here, in this piece of work, we have utilized an in silico structural 33 biology and advanced immunoinformatic strategies to devise a multi-epitope subunit vaccine 34 against ongoing COVID-19 infection. The engineered vaccine sequence is adjuvanted with \u00df-35 3 defensin and comprised of B-cell epitopes, HTL epitopes and CTL epitopes. This is very 36 likely that the vaccine will be able to elicit the strong immune response. Further, specific 37 binding of the engineered vaccine and immune cell receptor TLR3 was estimated by 38 molecular interaction studies. Strong interaction in the binding groove as well as good 39 docking scores affirmed the stringency of engineered vaccine. The interaction is stable with 40 minimal deviation in root-mean square deviation and root-mean-square fluctuation was 41 confirmed by the molecular dynamics simulation experiment. The immune-simulation by C-42 ImmSim server, which mimics the natural immune environment, yielded more potent 43 immune response data of B-cells, Th cells, Tc cells and IgG for vaccine. The encouraging 44 data obtained from the various in-silico works indicated this vaccine as an effective 45 therapeutic against COVID-19.",

These \"tool proteins\" i.e. non-structural proteins are the key (toolkit) to 119 synthesize the other structural proteins (Spike, Membrane, Envelope and Nucleocapsid) and 120 factors which requires to grow its progeny (Lewis et al., 2020) .

SARS-CoV belongs to genera 74 Betacoronaviruses that originated from Guangdong Province in Southern part of China in 75 year 2002 (Ismail et al., 2003), which unfortunately claimed 774 human lives and >8,000 76 infections in human from 37 countries around the globe in 2002 to 2003 (Zhou et al., 2018). 77 Another outbreak, MERS-CoV was started from Saudi Arab in 2012 (Zhou et al., 2018) and 78 2494 infection cases of MERS-CoV were reported as laboratory confirmed cases with 858 79 fatal cases from 2012 to date which includes claim of 38 lives (Su et al., 2016). Past two 80 outbreaks and a recent ongoing outbreak may only be a fraction of what yet to come or can be 81 seen and understood i.e. more severe and possibly new zoonotic infections of coronaviruses 82 incidences yet to be discovered which shows a worldwide warning to public health (Peiris et 83 al., 2004). 84 Researchers are trying to solve the enigma of the origin of the SARS-CoV-2. As per 85 evolutionary virologist, it is rarely possible the direct jump of the virus from bat to human 86 there should be one connecting link between them. Now, the puzzle is which animal worked 87 as a transient host from bats to humans. Recent announcement but those studies still have not 88 published, revealed an intermediate candidate i.e. Pangolins as transient host. 89 A high mortality rate of the past incidences shows the imperative need of the successful 90 vaccine candidate, which can ultimately lead to the prevention of such outbreaks. The best 91 way to overcome with the present situation and also preparedness for the upcoming outbreaks 92 is the development of the vaccine against this deadly COVID-19. Particularly, in the absence 93 of any effective drug treatment against these deadly viruses, vaccines are considered to be an 94 obligate requirement. The continuous spread of this devastating viral infection with high 95 mortality rate demands a protected and efficient vaccine. In modern times, multi-epitope 96 subunit vaccine (MESV) formulation is newest way to fight against deadly pathogens.",

Next, the adjuvant at the starting of 213 sequence (N-terminal) was added and then to link the adjuvant epitopes one more linker was 214 used i.e. EAAAK linker. After joining all the adjuvant, linkers and epitopes in a sequential215    manner, a single potential vaccine candidate was generated.216Physiochemical properties, antigenicity, allergenicity and toxicity prediction217    The physiochemical properties of the designed COVID-19 vaccine construct was predicted 218 with the help of ProtParam-an ExPASy server (https://web.expasy.org/protparam/). This 219 server computes the various parameters of protein sequence which includes theoretical pI, 220 molecular weight, estimated half-life, extension coefficient, instability index, aliphatic and 221 GRAVY index.222For the prediction of antigenicity of the designed construct, ANTIGENpro server 223 (http://scratch.proteomics.ics.uci.edu), share of Scratch protein predictor, was utilized. This is 224 the first server which predicted antigenicity of the entire protein by using experimental 225 proven microarray analysis reactivity data meant for five pathogens. This server predicts the 226 antigenicity of protein on the basis of alignment free and manner. It is a sequence based, 227 pathogen independent server whose predictions are made by five machine learning228 algorithms and further the antigenic or non-antigenic nature of the protein get finalized by 229 SVM (Support Vector Machine) classifier.230 Further, the allergenicity of the vaccine candidate was predicted by an online server namely 231 Algpred (http://crdd.osdd.net/raghava/algpred/) and AllerTop (https://www.ddg-232 pharmfac.net/AllerTOP/) servers. The AlagPred server predicts the allergenicity on the basis 233 of matching of vaccine sequence against the known epitope sequences (Saha and Raghava, 234 2006) whereas the AllerTop server utilizes the machine learning techniques which are 235 inclusive of DT (Decision tree), kNN (k nearest neighbours), LR (Logistic regression), MLP 236 (Multilayer perceptron) NB (na\u00efve Bayes), RF (Random forest) but among them the five-fold 237 cross validation was only showed by the kNN method with the maximum precision of 85.http://crdd.osdd.net/raghava/toxinpred/) was used to predict the toxicity of the designed 240 vaccine candidate. This tool predicts the toxicity of peptides as well as entire protein 241 sequences and accepts the input in fast format and then work on score of position specific 242 basis of Quantitative Matrix, which further identifies the toxicity of the submitted sequence 243 (Gupta et al., 2015). http://raptorx.uchicago.edu/StructPredV2/predict/). The server compares the input sequence 247 with other nonredundant homologs in order to evaluate the quality of model and then on this 248 basis generates the 3D structure accordingly. RaptorX server graded second and it works by 249 utilizing CNF (conditional neural fields), CRF (conditional random field) and MTT (multiple 250 template threading) which assimilate various biological signals and convert them into a 251 plausible nonlinear scoring function (K\u00e4llberg et al., 2014). 252 Tertiary structure (3D) refinement, model quality assessment and validation 253 The refinement of the obtained tertiary structure was done with the help of 3D protein 254 structure refinement server (http://sysbio.rnet.missouri.edu/3Drefine/). This CSAP (Critical 255 Assessment of protein Structure Prediction) evaluated server is freely available and demands 256 either the initial structure or protein sequence as input in order to perform the statistical and 257 graphical analysis. The server utilizes complete physics and intelligence-based force fields to 258 perform the frequentative optimization of hydrogen bonds and energy minimization 259 (Bhattacharya et al., 2016). 260 After refinement of the 3D structure, the quality of model was again verified with the ://swissmodel.expasy.org/qmean/). The QMEAN server evaluates the global and local 263 quality of the structure. As input the server requires a 3D model in PDB format or sequence 264 of the protein. Before proceeding to the submit option, user can choose scoring function as 265 per their requirement, there are three QMEAN scoring functions-1. QMEAN 2. 266 QMEANDisco 3. QMEANBrane. The complex QMEAN scoring function includes two 267 subtypes QMEAN4 and QMEAN6 which estimates the quality of complete structure and also 268 for each amino acid by using single PDB model. The second one is QMEANDISCO, this also 269 perform the same function as QMEAN does, except calculating the pairwise distance 270 constraints (DisCo) between each amino acid residues. The last one is QMEANBrane, this 271 only evaluates the local quality of models, especially for membrane proteins and also show 272 the membrane, soluble, interface and transmembrane part of the input PDB model (Benkert et 273 al., 2009). 274 At last, after the structure modelling, refinement and quantitative energy analysis its 275 validation is a very decisive part. For the validation purpose, we have utilized RAMPAGE 276 server (http://mordred.bioc.cam.ac.uk/~rapper/rampage.php). As an input the server requires 277 the PDB structure on protein and then utilizes the quantum mechanics to predict the favoured, 278 allowed and disallowed regions. The prediction was done on the basis of phi vs psi backbone 279 angles, steric clashes, hydrogen bond energy, planarity of peptide bonds (Lovell et al., 2003). ://milou.science.uu.nl/services/HADDOCK2.2/haddockserver-easy.html). This server 284 utilized both biochemical bioinformatics and biophysical methods information to improve 285 sampling and scoring of docking results. As an input the server requires the active and 286 passive residues from both the receptor and ligand as well as their energy minimized PDB 287 models. These interactive residues firstly, predicted with the help of CPROT server and then 288 used in HADDOCK. The server provides the output on the basis of van der Waals energy, Z 289 score, desolvation energy, RMSD score, etc., in which the Z-score represents the estimation 290 of standard deviation (De Vries et al., 2010). 291 Molecular dynamics simulation of designed vaccine candidate and TLR-3 receptor 292 For the dynamical simulation of designed vaccine candidate and TLR-3 receptor, in this 293 study, we have utilized GROMACS (GROningen MAchine for Chemical Simulations) v5.0 294 programme with the force field GROMOS96 43A1. This works on the command lines and 295 after the run of program, trajectory files were generated which is a time taken process but 296 defines the motion of all the atoms over the time (Abraham et al., 2015; Ojha et al., 2020; 297 Van Der Spoel et al., 2005). Before starting the first step in GROMACS all the HOH atoms 298 were get removed via PYMOL software and then input the PDB file to start the first module 299 of GROMACS as pdb2gmx. After this the topology file of the input protein was generated 300 which have all the specifics about bonded and non-bonded interaction or features. After this 301 the next step was of solvation, with the help of commands the protein get centred in a box of 302 1.0 nm, which was then filled with the solvent (can be water or any other solvent). Further, 303 the ions (Na or Cl ions) were added in the solvation box, having the charged protein, in order 304 to exchange the HOH molecules with it. Then, prior to MD run, energy minimization of the 305 protein was done to achieve the lowest energy of the protein. Subsequently, the equilibration 306 of the solvent was done in association with pressure (NPT) and temperature (NVT). After the 307 stabilization of pressure and temperature ensembles, the final MD simulation ran for 10ns to 308 positively produce the trajectory files, which defines the microscopic movement of the 309 system. 310 Immune dynamics simulation of the designed COVID-19 vaccine candidate 311 In this study, we have performed an in silico experiment which generates the immune-312 response for vaccine candidate. There is an online dynamic immune simulation server https://www.iac.cnr.it/~filippo/projects/c-immsim-online.html) (Rapin et al., 2010) which 315 uses the sequence of vaccine candidate as an input. The advanced C-ImmSim server, which is 316 consistent with earlier version uses the amino acid strings in place of Bit strings. As per the 317 literature, dose interval of 1 month is prescribed for immunization of vaccine, though there 318 are some vaccines where the difference can be 2, 3 or 6 months between first immunization 319 and first booster dose. Thus, we had chosen the one-month interval and identified the dose 320 dependent immunological response of our vaccine candidate. Besides, the likeliness of the 321 immune response generated by the vaccine (in response to pathogen invasion) was analyzed 322through repeated exposure of X following injection doses. In each instance, one dose was 323 made up of X vaccine molecules where the simulation was conducted for almost X days.324Finally, the immune response generated was calculated in the form of Simpson Index (D).",

            "text": "general, proteome of the SARS-CoV-2 has both structural and non-structural proteins and 332 after literature survey we came across this point that the non-structural proteins of virus are 333 mainly responsible for their replication in host(Ojha et al., 2019a). Here, in this study we334    have targeted \"toolkit\" of the virus i.e. the non-structural proteins for vaccine designing.335    Recently, researchers have reported the study about multi-epitope vaccine against the novel336    coronavirus and in that, they have targeted the structural protein of coronavirus whereas in 337 our current study we have selected the non-structural proteins as they have also been reported338    as key or potential antiviral drug targets. So, targeting the already reported drug targets for 339 vaccine designing purpose will be more effective. Further, as per recent survey report, it was 340 found that SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV both belongs to the same beta coronavirus group 341 with the 70% similarity between their genomes (Cheng and Shan, 2020). So, targeting the 342 replication machinery proteins of this deadly coronavirus for vaccine designing could be a 343 better way to block the expansion of disease either its SARS or COVID-19.344For the development of immunogenic vaccine, we have proceeded by retrieving all 345 the six key proteins from NCBI database. Apart from this, by using pBLAST server we have346 checked the homology of all the viral protein with human proteome. With this process we 347 came to conclusion that none of the viral protein was showing any kind of sequence 348 identity/similarity with the human proteins expect, helicase protein. The helicase protein was 349 showing 22.4% of identity and 34% query coverage with the ZGRF1 isoforms proteins of 350 homo sapiens, but as per Pearson William (2013) (Pearson, 2013), for the purpose of vaccine 351 designing the sequence similarity between the human and pathogen should not be more than 352 40% in order to overcome the probabilities of cross reactivity. Here, with this data we can 353 conclude that the non-structural proteins used for vaccine designing will show no cross-354 reactivity reactions when administered in host. Also, we have checked the antigenicity of all 355 the selected non-structural proteins with the help of ANTIGENpro server. The result 356 indicates that the all the proteins were highly antigenic in nature and their sequences can be 357 utilized for the purpose of vaccine designing (Supplementary Table-1). 358 Antigenic B-cell epitopes prediction from the COVID-19 proteome 359 B-cell epitope prediction was done via ABCPred server and the obtained epitopes were then 360 finalized on the basis of their ranking and highest score. The epitopes with highest score have 361 the highest binding affinity. A total six B-cell epitopes were selected (one from each protein 362 sequence) with the length of 10 mer amino acid each (Supplementary table 1). 363 Antigenic MHC class II epitopes prediction from the COVID-19 proteome 364 This study has utilized the most reliable and validated immunoinformatic servers for the 365 prediction of antigenic epitopes (B-cell, HTL and CTL) which are probably conserved across 366 the diverse coronavirus species and expected to recognize the human T-cell and B-cell 367 receptors in order to generate a potential immune response against the COVID-19. The 368 immunoinformatic servers provides an easiest way, which curtails the experimental effort for 369 the epitope identification. In the field of vaccinology, many researchers with the help of 370 reverse vaccinology approach have proved the antigenicity of peptide vaccines in 371 contradiction of various infectious diseases (Dikhit et al., 2017; Muruato et al., 2017; Ojha et 372 al., 2018; Pandey et al., 2019).373For the identification of antigenic HTL epitopes from all the protein sequences, IEDB 374 server was utilized. The epitopes were sorted on the basis on percentile rank which was less 375 than or equal to 0.9 and IC 50 value, less than or equal to 50. The lowest percentile rank and IC50 value denotes good binding affinity of epitopes with the HLA (Human leucocyte 377 antigen). The next criteria, selection of allele, was done on the basis of distribution of 378 population in the COVID-19 endemic regions. In the current study, we have tried to cover 379 almost all regions in which COVID-19 confirmed cases were reported and total 12 epitopes 380 were selected i.e. two epitopes from each protein sequence Alleles according to their 381 frequency and geographical region has been mentioned inFigure 2. The IC 50 value and the 382 percentile rank score of each epitope has been given separately in supplementary file as table Graphical representation of predicted HTL epitopes along with their percentile 385 rank and HLA distribution.386 Antigenic MHC class I epitopes prediction from the COVID-19 proteome 387 The CTL epitopes were predicted via NetCTL server and at the time of prediction all the 388 parameters were set to default for instance, C-terminal cleavage (0.15), threshold value important for the effective and specified recognition of T-cell epitopes from 391 many viral diseases for instance HIV, MMR, MERS, SARS etc. The supertype selection in 392 this study was done according to the percentage of worldwide population coverage. With the 393 help of literature survey, we came across that the supertypes A2, A3 and B7 together covers 394 around 88% population globally (Sette and Sidney, 1999; Shen et al., 2018). A total of 18 395 epitopes were selected; three from each protein sequence (Supplementary table 3).396 Designing of COVID-19 multi-epitope antigenic vaccine candidate 397 After the prediction of all antigenic vaccine candidates, they were joined with each other with 398 the help of linkers in order to generate a single construct. However, in multi-epitope vaccine 399 each epitope should have the capability to induce the potential immune response and for that 400 linkers are the main factor which are involved in locating the epitopes as well as responsible 401 for the immunogenicity of the entire construct. They are also use to discrete the domains, in a 402 single protein sequence without distressing the function of protein and helps to maintain a 403 stable and flexible protein complex. Here, in this study we have used different types of 404 linkers to connect the epitopes for instance, for linking B-cell epitopes \"KK\" (Yano et al., 405 2005) (augmentation of proteasome processing) linkers were used while for linking CTL and 406 HTL epitopes \"AAY\" (Ojha et al., 2019b) (proteasomal cleavage site and avoid the genesis 407 of new epitope) and \"GPGPG (Livingston et al., 2002) (for improving the flexibility of 408 protein)\" linkers were availed, respectively. Along with these linkers one more linker was 409 used i.e. EAAAK, which has been reported as a helix forming linker in the designing of next-410 generation vaccine. Next, to acquire more immunogenic construct, at the N-terminal of the 411 designed vaccine an adjuvant namely, human beta defensin 3 (45 amino acids) was attached. 412 This TLR-3 agonist human beta defensin 3 has been well known to augment the strong T-cell 413 and B-cell immunity (Gupta et al., 2020; Mohan et al., 2013). 414 After linking of all the epitopes, a single immunogenic vaccine candidate of 561 amino acids 415 was created. Here, we have designed the vaccine candidate in this sequential manner-416 Adjuvant-B-cell-HTL-CTL. In the vaccine sequence, the former 45 amino acids were 417 occupied by an adjuvant, next 6 amino acids were of EAAAK linker and then from number 418 51-120 amino acids were covered by B-cell epitopes whereas 121-345 and 346-561 were 419 obscured by HTL and CTL epitopes, respectively (Supplementary figure 1). 420 Assessment of physiochemical properties, antigenicity, allergenicity and toxicity of 421 designed COVID-19 vaccine candidate 422 The physiochemical properties were computed on the basis of certain parameters such as 423 instability index which was 26.9, (should be less than 40) hence, showing the stable nature of 424 the vaccine candidate. Next, on the basis of N-terminal residue (N-end rule), half-life of the 425 protein was estimated (on models like yeast and E. coli in vivo, mammalian reticulocytes in 426 vitro), which denotes that after the synthesis of protein in cell, at what time partial amount of 427 the protein will get dissipate? As per result, we have found that the estimated half-life for the 428 designed vaccine candidate was >30 hours and hence, inversely demonstrating that designed 429 vaccine candidate was stale in nature. The calculated GRAVY (Grand average of 430 hydropathicity) score was 0.060 and this positive score specifies the highly hydrophobic 431 nature of protein. Next, the aliphatic index of the protein epitomizes the space reserved by 432 aliphatic side chains (AVIL) and the calculated score was 81.99, the higher aliphatic index 433 denotes highly stable side chains of the protein. Other calculated parameters have been shown 434 in",

For the 443 antigenicity prediction AlgPred server was used and the result obtained from this server was 444 based on the 6 approaches (IgE mapping, MEME/Mast motif, SVM modules based on both 445 amino acid and dipeptide composition, BLAST search on ARPs and combined approach or 446 hybrid approach which involves all the parameters). Among these 6 approaches, SVM 447 modules based on both amino acid and dipeptide composition and Hybrid approach identified 448 the vaccine construct as allergenic whereas MEME/Mast motif, BLAST search on ARPs, IgE 449 mapping approaches identified the construct as non-allergenic. So, further to cross check this 450 mystery we again checked the allergenicity with AllerTop server, the result from this server 451 exposed the designed vaccine construct as probable non-allergen. Hence, by taking both the 452 results from different servers into consideration, we concluded that designed vaccine 453",

Featuring the effect of this debilitating outbreak is not feasible because of 621 its rapid spread. The recent three outbreaks of coronaviruses in past two decades are different 622 from their \"common cold\" causing friends and can spark a fire in individual's body. The 623 newly dubbed enemy, in the form of virus was initially named as COVID-19 by World 624 Health Organization (WHO) and now formally named as SARS-CoV-2. The virus primarily 625 attacks on respiratory system, which involves three major steps: replication of the virus, 626 hyper-reactivity of the immune system and pulmonary obstruction. As per the WHO, the 627 virus makes the perforated holes in the lungs, which upon infection give them honey-comb 628 appearance. To inhibit the viral infections in human the vaccination is one of the most 629 desirable way.

The physicochemical parameters of vaccine candidate which 633 includes allergenicity, solubility, pI, hydrophobicity, molecular weight, GRAVY, half-life 634 indicated its effectiveness. The binding specificity of the vaccine candidate with human 635 immune cell receptor i.e. TLR3 was assessed by molecular docking interaction. Lowest 636 energy score obtained showed the strong interaction and specificity between vaccine and 637 binding groove of TLR3 receptor. Our devised vaccine candidate showed the stable and 638 prolonged binding in molecular dynamics simulation with negligible deviation in RMSF and 639 RMSD values. Additionally, immune simulation that mimics the natural environment in 640 computational immunology experiment exhibited the strong immunological response data 641 from the major players of the immunity i.e. cell mediated (T-cell) and humoral (B-cell) at 642 different doses at different intervals for COVID-19 multi-epitope subunit vaccine.
