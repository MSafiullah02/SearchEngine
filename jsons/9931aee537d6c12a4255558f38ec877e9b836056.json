COVID-19 reaches out to many countries in the world, and the number of daily cases continues to increase rapidly. In order to simulate, track, and forecast the trend of the virus spread, several mathematical and statistical models have been developed. Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Quarantined-Recovered-Death-Insusceptible (SEIQRDP) model is one of the most promising dynamic systems that has been proposed for estimating the transmissibility of the COVID-19. In the present study, we propose a Fractional-order SEIQRDP model to analyze the COVID-19 epidemic. The Fractional-order paradigm offers a flexible, appropriate, and reliable framework for pandemic growth characterization. In fact, fractional-order operator is not local and consider the memory of the variables. Hence, it takes into account the sub-diffusion process of confirmed and recovered cases growth. The results of the validation of the model using real COVID-19 data are presented, and the pertinence of the proposed model to analyze, understand and predict the epidemic is discussed.",

Basically, mathematical paradigms are considered to be very useful in this context, as they provide detailed mechanisms for the epidemic dynamics. Among the most widely investigated model for the characterization of the COVID-19 outbreak in the world is the classic Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) model [1] . Since the outbreak of the virus, the SEIR model has been intensively utilized to evaluate the effectiveness of multiple measures, which seems to be a challenging task for general other estimation methods [5] [6] [7] . For instance, it has been employed to evaluate the effects of lock-down on the transmission dynamics between provinces in China, such as the effect of the lock-down in Hubei province on the transmission in Wuhan and Beijing [7] . In addition, a cascading scheme of the SEIR model has been studied to emulate the process of transmission from infection sources to humans. This approach was efficient to reach useful conclusions on the outbreak dynamics [8] . The work of [9] presented a generalization of the classical SEIR known as Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Quarantined-Recovered-Death-Insusceptible (SEIQRDP) model, for the epidemic analysis of COVID-19 in China. This generalization is based on the introduction of a new quarantined state and of the effect of preventive actions, which are considered as crucial epidemic parameters for COVID-19, such as the latent and quarantine time. As a result, considering this generalization of SEIR, the estimation of the inflection point, ending time, and total infected cases in widely affected regions was accurately determined and verified.",

FD models offer a promising tool for the description of complex systems, in addition to their potential to incorporate accurately the memory and delay involved in the systems, it also provides more flexibility than classical integer-order models in fitting the data accurately [12] .In this paper, we investigate a fractional version of the (SEIQRDP) model in modeling the COVID-19 epidemic's dynamics. We will use real data to fit the model and analyze the results, and we will provide some insights on the interpretation and role of the fractional derivatives [11] . This paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we will recall some basic concepts from the SEIQRDP epidemic model and the fractional-order derivatives. Section III is devoted to the presentation of fractional-order (SEIQRDP) epidemic model (F-SEIQRDP). In Section IV, we present the materials and methods. Section v present the estimation results. The last section discusses the obtained results and provides some future directions on the use of the model for analyzing and controlling the COVID-19 epidemic.",

From the reported results, it is clear that for all the studied cities the ReRMSE as well as the RMSE based on F-SEIQRDP model are less than the ones reported using SEIQRDP. These results show the usefulness of the fractional-order derivative operator in fitting real data of the pandemic. In addition, it demonstrates the potential of the fractional-order framework in estimating the size and the key milestones of the spread of the epidemic-COVID-19. The appropriateness of the fractional-order paradigm can be visualized from the fact that: FD operator is not local and depends on the strength of the memory that is controlled by the fractional differentiation order. On the other hand, the epidemiological dynamical process is involving the memory effect within the sub-diffusion process of confirmed and recovered cases growth.",
