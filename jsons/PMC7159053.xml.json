CT is important in the diagnosis and treatment of lung diseases. In our experience, the imaging features of COVID-19 pneumonia are diverse, ranging from normal appearance to diffuse changes in the lungs. In addition, different radiological patterns are observed at different times throughout the disease course. Because the time between onset of symptoms and the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was as short as 9 days among the initial patients with COVID-19 pneumonia,5 early recognition of the disease is essential for the management of these patients.",

We also searched CNKI and Wanfang Data using the same terms in Chinese, with no time restrictions. We found only previously published research discussing the radiological characteristics of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus or Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, and preliminary studies on the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan. We found no published work about the radiological characteristics of patients with pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection.\nAdded value of this study\nWe analysed chest CT images from 81 patients confirmed to have COVID-19 pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection, and described the imaging findings across different follow-up periods of the disease, including subclinical and clinical stages up to 3 weeks after symptom onset. This study is, to the best of our knowledge, the largest case series to date on the CT findings of COVID-19 pneumonia worldwide, and provides detailed information on the radiological, clinical, and laboratory features of these patients. Our findings provide insight in the evolution of the disease and its corresponding imaging changes, and suggest potential associations between imaging findings and patient outcomes, which requires further study.\nImplications of all the available evidence\nSARS-CoV-2 has substantial capacity to infect humans, and is capable of human-to-human transmission. Infection can lead to severe respiratory symptoms, including acute respiratory distress syndrome, and the mortality rate is around 2%. Combining imaging assessments with clinical and laboratory findings could help to identify SARS-CoV-2 infections early.\n",

The predominant pattern was ground-glass opacity, with ill-defined margins, air bronchograms, smooth or irregular interlobular or septal thickening, and thickening of the adjacent pleura. These imaging characteristics are non-specific and bear some resemblance to those of SARS-CoV22, 23, 24 and MERS-CoV infections.25, 26 However, unlike SARS-CoV infections, some patients in our study presented with pleural effusion, lymphadenopathy, and round cystic changes on CT. Previous studies showed that the presence of pleural effusion in patients infected with MERS-CoV or avian influenza H5N1 was a poor prognostic indicator.25, 27, 28 Similarly, in one patient who died in our study (patient 3), a follow-up CT scans showed that he had developed bilateral pleural effusion. On the other hand, lymphadenopathy has also been seen in cases of H5N1 infection,28 which can present as a rapidly progressive pneumonia that results in ARDS. Round cystic changes on CT might be associated with the process of resorption of consolidation; which might be explained by the infection causing damage to the alveolar walls and leading to pneumatoceles. Other findings included intralobular or interlobular septal thickening, and a crazy-paving pattern. However, none of the CT features of COVID-19 seem to be specific or diagnostic, and COVID-19 pneumonia shares CT features with other non-infectious conditions that present as subpleural air-space disease. For example, patients with bronchiolitis obliterans with organising pneumonia29, 30 often show nodules (32%),29 lymphadenopathy (13%),30 and pleural effusion (20%).30 These findings were present, albeit with lower frequency, among our patients with COVID-19 pneumonia (nodules 6%, lymphadenopathy 13%, pleural effusion 5%). However, tree-in-bud signs, masses, cavitations, and calcifications, often suggestive of bacterial or chronic infections, were absent in our study.",

In the first week after symptom onset (group 2), lesions quickly evolved to bilateral, diffuse disease, with a relative decrease in the frequency of ground-glass opacities and a transition to consolidation and mixed-pattern development. Pleural effusion and lymphadenopathy were also detected in group 2. Subsequently, ground-glass opacities continued to decrease in frequency throughout the second week after symptom onset (group 3), while consolidation became the second most common pattern. A reticular pattern associated with bronchiolectasis and irregular interlobular or septal thickening were also noted to increase progressively from the second week. These findings indicated the appearance of interstitial changes, suggesting the development of fibrosis. However, since the natural history of COVID-19 pneumonia is yet to be fully explored, it is too early to label these lung changes as irreversible fibrosis. As the disease progressed in the third week after symptom onset, consolidation and mixed patterns became more common, while ground-glass opacities decreased further. Bronchiolectasis, thickening of the adjacent pleura, and pleural effusion mainly appeared at this stage.",

Follow-up CT showed progression or improvement of lung lesions during treatment, sensitively reflecting therapeutic effects, and these changes might be related to outcomes in such patients. The most common pattern of evolution throughout series of CT scans in this study was initial progression to a peak level, followed by radiographic improvement (type 1), and most of these patients were subsequently discharged. In addition, most patients who showed a pattern of radiographic improvement across several scans (type 3) were discharged from hospital. Thus, a type 1 or type 3 disease course might be associated with favourable outcomes.

Second, we compared imaging patterns between four groups of different time intervals from the onset of symptoms, which does not account for potential individual variations. Third, because of the short time for case collection, follow-up CT scans were available for only 57 patients, around 40% of whom had only two CT scans. Although we have outlined the main patterns of evolution seen on CT imaging in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, long-term radiological follow-up is needed to confirm our findings. Finally, as lung biopsy specimens were not available in this study, the relationship between radiological and histopathological findings remains to be investigated.
