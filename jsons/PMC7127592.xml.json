            "text": "Coronaviruses (family Coronaviridae, order Nidovirales) are large (120\u2013160 nm), enveloped, roughly spherical particles. They possess a nonsegmented single-stranded RNA genome of up to 31 kb in positive orientation. Based on serologic cross-reactivities and sequence analysis, coronaviruses are classified in 3 distinct groups (Eickmann et al., 2003, Gorbalenya et al., 2004, Kim et al., 2006, Weiss and Navas-Martin, 2005). Coronaviruses are known to infect many domestic animals as well as humans, causing acute and chronic diseases of the respiratory, enteric, and central nervous system (Weiss and Navas-Martin, 2005). Human coronaviruses (HCoVs) 229E and OC43 have 1st been described in the 1960s (Hamre et al., 1967, McIntosh et al., 1967) and are thought to be responsible for 10% to 30% of all common colds (Larson et al., 1980, Myint, 2006). The new infectious disease severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) emerged in November 2002 in Guangdong Province, People's Republic of China. Within a few months, SARS had spread to 26 countries, infecting more than 8000 people of whom almost 10% died (Poutanen and Low, 2004). The etiologic agent was recognized to be a novel virus, termed SARS-CoV (Drosten et al., 2003), which is related to, but distinct from other, known coronaviruses. Recent findings suggest a close relationship between SARS-CoV and group II coronaviruses (Kim et al., 2006). In 2004, van der Hoek et al. (2004) reported the isolation of a new group I CoV from a 7-month-old child with bronchiolitis, named HCoV-NL63. Independently described viruses HCoV-NL (Fouchier et al., 2004) and HCoV-NH (Esper et al., 2005b) are closely related to NL63 and likely represent strains of the same species of virus (Kahn, 2006, Van der Hoek and Berkhout, 2005). HCoV-NL63 has been linked to more severe ailments, such as morbus croup (van der Hoek et al., 2005), and a systemic vasculitis in young children, Kawasaki disease, although association with the latter is discussed controversially (Esper et al., 2005a, Shimizu et al., 2005). NL63 infections have been reported throughout the world (Arden et al., 2005, Bastien et al., 2005, Chiu et al., 2005, Garbino et al., 2006), indicating that this HCoV can be regarded as a new major etiologic agent of respiratory disorders. HCoV-HKU1 was 1st isolated 2005 in Hong Kong from a 71-year-old man suffering from pneumonia and was classified as group II coronavirus (Woo et al., 2005a). So far, this strain has been detected in Asia, Europe, Unites States, and Australia in connection with respiratory and enteric tract illness (Esper et al., 2006, Garbino et al., 2006, Lau et al., 2006, Sloots et al., 2006, Vabret et al., 2006).",

Here, we describe the establishment of a line immunoassay for rapid and simultaneous detection of antibodies directed against the 5 known HCoVs (229E, NL63, OC43, HKU1, and SARS) in human sera based on recombinant viral N proteins.

All sera obtained from convalescent patients (HCoV-OC43 or HCoV-229E infection) reacted with the respective antigens as expected. A strong induction of humoral responses was observed in 5 out of 6 (OC43) and 3 out of 6 (229E) cases (Table 2). Yet, amplified signal intensities in postinfection OC43 sera (BCM-1B to BCM-6B) were accompanied by sturdy reactions with the HKU1 antigen, except for BCM-3B, where, overall, only weak signals were detected (Table 2). Reaction intensities of sera derived from HCoV-229E\u2013infected patients increased from acute to convalescent phase in 3 serum pairs (BCM-9A/B, BCM-11A/B, and BCM-12A/B), whereas in the remaining 3 sample pairs (BCM-7A/B, BCM-8A/B, BCM-10A/B), no clear boost of antibodies could be detected (Table 2). However, serum BCM-10B, responding only weakly to 229E N, exhibited distinct reactions to OC43 and to HKU1 N antigens. This observation raises the possibility of a collateral acute infection with HCoV-OC43. In addition, defined sera from HCoV-229E\u2013infected patients (BCM-7 to BCM-12) uniformly showed presence of a basal level of NL63-specific antibodies. Stronger antibody response in case of samples BCM-9A/B does not necessarily imply nonspecific cross-reactions between 229E and NL63. Remarkably, none of the tested coronavirus positive sera reacted with the SARS antigen (Fig. 2, Table 2).",

Two, so far, unknown viruses, NL63 and HKU1, have since been identified, and detection of further HCoVs in the future is likely. The major technique to diagnose HCoV infections today is RT-PCR, whereas serologic assays distinguishing between all types of HCoVs are, to our knowledge, almost completely missing. Yet, epidemiologic studies regarding coronavirus prevalence are of great interest. However, techniques such as nucleic acid diagnostics are not suitable because coronaviral RNA can only be detected during the acute phase of infection or shortly thereafter. In addition, if clinical symptoms are mild or missing altogether, serology opens the possibility to identify silent converters, which, in the case of SARS, represents highly valuable information on the actual virus distribution among the population.",

            "text": "Based on previous reports (Tan et al., 2004, Timani et al., 2004, Zhu et al., 2006) and protein sequence comparisons, which revealed relatively low sequence identities and similarities (Table 3\n), we considered nucleocapsid proteins as appropriate antigenic markers for retrospective diagnosis of coronavirus infections in humans. The highest amino acid sequence identities are present between HKU1- and OC43-encoded nucleocapsids (68.2% identity, 74.5% similarity). N protein sequences of all other coronaviruses considered as antigens in our immunoassay exhibit much lower amino acid identities when compared with each other (31.9\u201349.3% identity, 38.5\u201357.8% similarity; Table 3). Therefore, we established a line immunoassay using recombinant N proteins as antigens to specifically detect coronavirus-directed antibodies in human sera. Validation of the newly developed test was carried out by assaying well-defined sera of patients who suffered from various coronaviral infections. Consistently, all available human sera sampled from convalescent patients (tested positive for HCoVs 229E, OC43, or SARS-CoV by microneutralization experiments, Western blotting, ELISA, or IF) reacted with their respective antigens as expected, indicating an excellent sensitivity of our line immunoassay. Although antigenic cross-reactivity to SARS nucleocapsid has been described earlier (Chan et al., 2005, Sun and Meng, 2004, Woo et al., 2004, Yip et al., 2007), we could not detect any serologic cross-reactivity with SARS N, even in those cases where donors strongly responded to the other 4 nucleocapsids (Fig. 4, D-17). Accordingly, only sera obtained from convalescent SARS patients reacted with the SARS antigen. Moreover, antibody binding reactions with SARS N were consistently strong, as demonstrated in Fig. 3. We identified 6 samples showing a single distinct band proving presence of anti\u2013SARS-CoV antibodies. Five specimens reacted only with 1 additional HCoV antigen (e.g., Fig. 3, D52 and CH26), deriving from preexisting antibodies of anterior HCoV infections. Based on these findings, we conclude that there is no evidence of any nonspecific binding of SARS-specific antibodies to antigens of other HCoVs in convalescent SARS sera. Thus, SARS N protein provides a powerful tool to differentiate between SARS infection and infections with other HCoVs in serologic studies. However, cross-reactions among other HCoVs might occur. N proteins of OC43 and HKU1 (group I HCoVs) display the highest amino acid identities among all coronaviruses (68.2%, Table 3), and nonspecific binding of antibodies directed against OC43 N to HKU1 N is possibly observed (Fig. 2, BCM-1A/B, Table 2). The donor of serum sample BCM-1A/B was not tested for HKU1 infection (samples were characterized before primary detection of HKU1). However, double infection with OC43 and HKU1 seems unlikely because simultaneous detection of HKU1- and OC43-directed antibodies occurred in all but 1 serum pair (BCM-3A/B). Nonetheless, we also tested sera comprising IgGs that recognized OC43 N without binding to HKU1 N (Fig. 4, D-15), contradicting a general cross-reactivity. Nonspecific cross-reactions between 229E and NL63 (group I HCoVs) antigens appear rather unlikely because amino acid identities between both nucleocapsids are relatively low (49.3%, Table 3). Nevertheless, in a single 229E-positive serum sample, NL63 antibody response seemed to be coinduced (BCM-9A/B; Table 2, Fig. 2). The other defined sera sampled from 229E-infected patients (BCM-7 to BCM-12) consistently indicated antibody binding signals to NL63 N. These sera were initially not characterized for the presence of NL63 viral agent because NL63 was actually not discovered at sampling time. Thus, proof of NL63-specific antibodies in these sera is not necessarily evidence for cross-reactivity. Coinfections of 229E and NL63, or previous contact with NL63 earlier in the lives of these patients, resulting in basal antibody levels, cannot be excluded. Furthermore, positive reactions with OC43 N and HKU1 N in sample BCM-10B (Fig. 2, Table 2) could be due to a true HCoV-OC43 infection.",

The global SARS epidemic of 2002/2003 was controlled by a highly successful public health effort, and there have been no reported cases since April 2004. Thus, it appears that SARS-CoV is currently not circulating in humans. However, studies on the actual distribution of SARS-CoV are lacking, and surveys screening healthy donors for antibodies specific for SARS-CoV are rare (Yu et al., 2005). Contact leading to seroconversion may result in asymptomatic or subclinical manifestations (Che et al., 2006, Wilder-Smith et al., 2005) and are therefore not recognized as SARS infections. Hence, serology remains an important tool in SARS diagnosis.",

            "text": "In conclusion, we consider our line immunoassay approach to be highly favorable for large-scale epidemiologic studies on coronaviruses. Our assay system allows rapid and easy detection of antibodies against all known HCoVs in a single experiment with 1 antigen-coated strip, requiring only very low serum volumes (15 \u03bcL). By replacing secondary anti-human IgG with anti-human IgM, the immunoassay could easily be adjusted to screen for human IgM, which might flank RT-PCR\u2013based diagnosis of acute HCoV infections in clinical settings. In this context, it would be advisable to test sequential (acute and convalescent) serum samples to track seroconversion and to define the immunoassay's role in the diagnosis of acute infections. Assay setup and test strip production are straightforward and cost-effective. N proteins are appropriate antigens because they are extremely immunogenic and provide a sensitive and reliable tool for antibody detection. Yet, beyond acute infections, our data also indicate that cross-reactive epitopes among HCoVs within group I or group II might be involved in IgG response to HCoV nucleocapsids. In addition, the line immunoassay may detect all remote infections experienced in the past. To gain even better specificity and to exclude possible false-positive results, it would be beneficial to extend the antigen portfolio on the strips. Therefore, future experiments will aim at additional studies focusing on potential cross-reactivities and fine-tuning of our assay by inclusion of other antigens or specific immunoreactive peptides in addition to full-length N proteins.",
