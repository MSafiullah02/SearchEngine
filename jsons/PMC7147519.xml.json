            "text": "Warehouse capacity has been an important consideration that managers need to take into account to make optimal decisions in many industries. On one hand, extending warehouse capacity usually involves a long-run investment that is a strategic decision. Such investment would require a certain or predictable increment in demand for a long period. On the other hand, many supply chains have some certain peak time of demand in a short period due to short-term sales promotions or emergencies. Therefore, it would not be economical for those managers to invest for higher warehouse capacities which cannot be fully utilized in the long run. Moreover, it is usually not easy to rent warehouses for a short time, such as one month. There exist many studies on inventory system with tight warehouse capacity (refer to Wang et al., 2012, Fiestras-Janeiro et al., 2015), and delayed replenishment is considered as a solution to the single buyer case (refer to Lee and Wang, 2008, Yi and Sarker, 2013). For multi-buyer cases, we show that transshipment between warehouses of buyers could be an efficient approach to improving the supply chain performance. The following examples in China motivate our research.",

Because demands during those periods are much higher than those at other time, warehouse capacities at many retailers are not sufficient. However, it is not easy for them to expand their warehouse capacities. First, building new warehouses may fail to be beneficial because each peak time may last for two or three weeks. Second, warehouse owners prefer long-term contracts (longer than one year) that make leasing warehouse capacity for a short time usually unavailable in China. Although some retailers may sell multiple types of products, it is still difficult for them to smooth out the utilization of the warehouses by scheduling the arrival of products because the demands are much higher than the warehouse capacities. In this case, the companies replenish products to retailers simultaneously in every cycle, and transship products between them to fully utilize warehouse capacities during the demand peaks which can reduce the ordering and replenishment costs.",

The SARS lasted for about half a year when citizens generated high and specific demand for some Chinese traditional medicines. Because this demand was caused by emergency, supply chains could not extend warehouse capacities of retailers to satisfy the high demand. Therefore, transshipment between retailers was implemented to increase the utilization ratio of warehouse capacities of supply chains. In addition, the suppliers replenished retailers simultaneously in every cycle, to satisfy the constraints for long-distance transportation, including limited number of trucks and drivers.",

            "text": "In an integrated inventory system, the vendor can arbitrarily move the products from one buyer to another, which is known as transshipment between buyers. Transshipment can also be achieved under the vendor managed inventory (VMI) system, in which the vendor has the authority to conduct transshipment between buyers. The advantage of transshipment is twofold. First, under uncertain demands, transshipment between buyers can improve the customer service level, and it is popular in many industries, such as automobile and consumer goods (refer to Anupindi et al., 2001). In this case, transshipments transpire between a buyer with excess inventory and another with excess demand. To the best of our knowledge, most of existing studies on transshipment are motivated by this consideration. Second, under the transshipment policy, the vendor may improve the utilization ratio of the buyers\u2019 warehouse capacities by keeping products that exceed one buyer\u2019s warehouse capacity at other buyers\u2019 warehouses for a time. In this way, the vendor can move those products to that buyer at appropriate time points and benefit from this type of warehouse capacity sharing strategy. The above two examples reveal that this strategy has been implemented in the real world to improve the supply chain performance under some short-term selling seasons.",

For the algorithm, we propose an optimal transshipment policy on the basis of which we can obtain the channel-wide optimal order quantity and the transshipment quantities between buyers by using the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) condition.",

            "text": "A large body of literature is devoted to integrated inventory models with a single vendor and multiple buyers. Woo et al. (2001) studied an integrated inventory model for a single vendor and multiple buyers based on ordering cost reduction. In that model, the vendor orders raw materials and produces identical products for one cycle. Ordering costs can be reduced along with expenditure cost, and all of the buyers use the same replenishment cycle length. Zhang et al. (2007) extended the above model by considering that buyers can have different cycle lengths. Zavanella and Zanoni (2009) studied a VMI model by considering that buyers may receive the orders in different shipments. Darwish and Odah (2010) studied a VMI model with a single vendor and multiple buyers. In their model, the vendor orders and obtains the products at the beginning of each cycle, which is divided into several identical sub-cycles. All of the buyers share the same sub-cycle, and in each sub-cycle, the buyers obtain the amount of product to satisfy their demand. In that paper, they also considered a penalty cost for stock that exceeds buyers\u2019 warehouse capacity. Hariga et al. (2014) extended the above VMI model by considering a variable replenishment cycle. Sadeghi et al. (2014) studied a bi-objective inventory model for a three-stage supply chain with multiple retailers. In that model, the vendor has one replenishment frequency for all of the retailers. Mateen et al. (2015) analyzed a single vendor and multi-buyer inventory model and each buyer has an upper limit stock. Moreover, replenishment exceeding the limit generates a penalty cost in that model.",

Moreover, the vendor\u2019s warehouse capacity and buyers\u2019 budgets are considered in that model. Jha and Shanker (2013) studied a system wherein the buyers have the same length of sub-cycle but different lead times. In that model, the length of lead time can also be reduced with a crashing cost.

Shao et al. (2011) studied the incentives for transshipment in a supply chain with decentralized buyers. They showed that the manufacturer prefers a high transshipment price while the buyers prefer a low one. Chen et al. (2012) studied transshipment in the newsvendor problem wherein each selling season is divided into two phases: two retailers order at the beginning of the first phase, and one can obtain transshipped products from the other retailer at the beginning of the second phase. Noham and Tzur (2014) discussed a multi-item transshipment problem by considering the fixed cost of transshipment. Dan et al. (2016) proposed a two-period model with two retailers and a single supplier. The retailers can implement preventive transshipment at the beginning of the second period to rebalance their inventories. Lee and Park (2016) analyzed the inventory and transshipment policy for a supply chain with two retailers and a single supplier who has a random supply capacity. Zhao et al. (2016) studied the transshipment problem in an online-to-offline supply chain. In that dual channel, transshipment is conducted between the retailer and the manufacturer\u2019s direct channel to pool the inventory risk. These studies focused on the transshipment in the newsboy problem. In addition, Torabi et al. (2015) considered an inventory transshipment problem of an e-retailing channel in which products can be transshipped among retailers after the uncertain demand is revealed.",

The vendor is geographically far away from the buyers who are relatively geographically close to each other. The vendor orders and obtains the products at the beginning of each cycle, which is divided into several identical sub-cycles. The replenishment quantity of buyer i is equal to the demand during the sub-cycle (i.e., Ti), and T\n1\n = \nT\n2=, \u22ef ,=Tm. After receiving products from the supplier, the vendor sends the products to the buyers simultaneously with lead time Li for buyer i in each sub-cycle. We consider Li values to be exogenously specified parameters. Because we focus on the lateral transshipment under warehouse capacity constraints, we assume that each buyer has a certain product demand (consumption) rate which is a usual assumption in inventory literature (refer to Darwish and Odah, 2010, Hariga et al., 2014, Mateen et al., 2015). The order-quantity, reorder-point (Q, r) continuous review ordering policies are used at the buyers, each of whom has an inventory capacity. Preventive transshipment between buyers under centralized control occurs when the inventory levels reach the reorder points. Because the buyers are located in one region, we assume that the lead times of transshipments are negligible.

In Algorithm 2, all of the buyers who are not in E can transship products to the buyers in E.

Because Gap II is greater than Gap I, we can infer that this cost saving can be reduced if the fixed transshipment cost is not considered in the optimal solution algorithm. The influence of fixed transshipment cost is created by two circumstances. First, if we do not consider this fixed cost, then we may obtain a solution in which buyer i transships few products to buyer j while other buyers (e.g., buyer k) not in E also still transship products to buyer j. Although the unit transshipment cost, sij, is lower than skj, transshipping a small number of products cannot compensate for the fixed cost of involving three buyers in the transshipment. Second, there exist cases in which sij is lower than skj while fi is greater than fk. Under these conditions the transshipment cost may not be minimized if we decide the transshipment solution based on sij and skj without considering fi and fk. Therefore, we find a trade-off exists between the fixed cost and the transportation cost in the transshipment. Moreover, the gaps are larger for large problems because more buyers could be involved in transshipment, which increases Gaps I and II. Because many buyers characterize large problems, a wide solution space is created that affects the optimal GA solution, which increases Gap III.",

As a consequence, some buyers can obtain more products than their warehouses can accommodate. In addition, the utilization ratio of the warehouse capacities of some buyers is increased. When warehouse capacity is shared among buyers, the channel-wide optimal replenishment solution can be achieved. The numerical experiment shows the advantage of the TRAN model. The advantage can be more significant when the number of buyers is increased.",

First, we assumed that product consumption rates of buyers are known, and we focused on how supply chains benefit from transshipment as result of increased warehouse capacity. Considering the advantage of transshipment in increasing customer service level when the consumption rates are uncertain can be a fruitful direction. Second, we considered absolute constraints on the warehouse capacities of buyers. This model can be extended by considering penalty costs for exceeding upper bounds of inventory levels under our tight capacity constraints, which would make our model more applicable in general. Third, we studied an integrated channel and focused solely on reducing the channel-wide cost. It would be interesting to study the performances of members in a decentralized channel under a warehouse-sharing policy.",
