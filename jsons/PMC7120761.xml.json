            "text": " Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a type of recessive autosomal hemoglobinopathy. It is caused by a specific mutation in the gene that codifies the globin beta-chain in the hemoglobin (Hb) molecule, which results in a substitution of glutamic acid by a valine in the 6th position of the chain, thus creating HbS. This Hb is polymerized in the red blood cell, causing an alteration in its shape and hemolysis, which causes acute events and progressive damage in different organs. In 1910 James Herrick was the first to describe the characteristic shape of the red blood cell (drepanocytes, sickle cell, from the Latin falx, falcis: \u201csickle shape\u201d). Subsequently, Pauling et al. identified electrophoresis anomalies in HbS, and proposed the term \u201cmolecular disease\u201d in 1949, thus demonstrating for the first time that the production of an abnormal protein could be the cause of a genetic disorder.",

The concept of sickle cell anemia refers to the most usual presentation, in which the patient inherits HbS from both parents, thus being homozygote for the disease (HbSS); those who inherent an S-gene and another causing alteration in the \u03b2-chain will have other presentations of sickle cell disease, such as HbSC or HbS/\u03b2 thalassemia (\u03b20 when there is no production of \u03b2 chains; \u03b2+ when there is partial production). In all of these, HbS represents the greatest proportion of Hb in the erythrocyte. Heterozygous patients inherent only one allele from their parents: the other allele is normal (HbA), and they are named carriers (HbAS), and have what is known as \u201c sickle cell trait.\u201d Carriers are usually asymptomatic.",

Hb polymers trigger a cascade of events within the cell:Activation of transport channels, with potassium loss and cellular dehydration.Disruption of the red blood cell membrane, thus exposing it to membrane components, such as band 3 protein, which binds to specific antibodies, promoting erythrophagocytosis caused by macrophages.Liberation of hemoglobin in the plasma, with Fe3+, which promotes oxidative damage in the microenvironment.",

Although this process requires HbS polymerization, the trigger event for vascular obstruction is a type of inflammation. This inflammation results from an interaction between the erythrocyte and vascular endothelium, causing obstruction and ischemia episodes, which are followed by a restitution of the vascular flow, causing tissue damage mediated by reperfusion. Then, oxidative stress is triggered, which causes adhesion molecule overexpression, increasing inflammatory cytokines synthesis and leukocytosis. Hemolysis also contributes to vaso-occlusion. Hemoglobin liberation in plasma, caused by intravascular hemolysis, generates superoxide radicals and hydroxyl, which are potent inhibitors of nitric oxide (NO). This compound is produced under normal conditions in the endothelium and regulates the basal vasodilator tone, inhibits platelets, hemostatic activation, and the expression of adhesion molecules dependent on the nuclear factor k\u03b2 (FNk\u03b2). Hb release into the plasma also causes endothelial dysfunction and NO resistance. Hemolysis also liberates arginase-1 in the erythrocyte, which metabolizes arginine into ornithine, exhausting the substrate required to synthesize NO. All of this helps to maintain hypercoagulability, with an increase in the platelet activation and the levels of procoagulant factors in the blood.",

This PEP deficiency may contribute to a reduction in lung volume, as well as atelectasis. Changes in expiratory muscle force are caused by the fact that abdominal and internal intercostal muscles are supplied by epigastric and intercostal arteries, which do not have extensive collaterals. On the contrary, the diaphragm contributes to inspiration, and it is supplied by several arteries, and therefore is more resistant to ischemic processes.",
