Practical advances include the early development of diagnostic tests of infection that made blood donation safe, and since 1996, combination antiretroviral therapy that has great reduced incidence of AIDS in HIV-infected people who have access to the drugs. HIV prevention through behavioural change has been successful, and we do not yet have any safe and efficacious microbicides or vaccines.",

In this perspective, I shall not be so foolhardy as to attempt to provide a comprehensive review of HIV and AIDS; for that I recommend Jay Levy's book [2] . Rather, I provide a personal view of salient discoveries and remaining gaps in our knowledge. There have, of course, been magnificent advances in diagnosis and therapy, and in gaining insight into the immunopathogenesis of AIDS. However, despite sustained efforts by many talented investigators, we still appear to be near the starting block for controlling HIV through prevention.",

Epidemiologists at the Center for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta detected this unusual clustering of patients and set out to investigate its provenance. It was soon recognized that the underlying immune deficiency of 'gay compromise syndrome' was associated with a selective depletion of CD4 + T helper cells [4, 5] . In 1982 it became apparent that there must be an infectious agent inducing the disease when it was also found in injecting drug users and in recipients of blood transfusions, and thus the disease acquired the name 'acquired immune deficiency syndrome' [6] . With the manifestation of AIDS in patients with haemophilia [7] , the speculations were on some kind of virus as the cause because other microbes were unlikely to taint pooled clotting factors. In fact, the epidemiologists had elucidated the risk groups and modes of transmission accurately before the discovery of HIV itself.",

Because AIDS affected gay men disproportionately, there was an articulate, well-educated and assertive body of people with strong networks who could ask awkward questions and challenge any whiff of patronizing attitudes among physicians. They established advocacy groups to lobby on social and medical issues affecting HIV and AIDS. It was gay men at risk of AIDS who pioneered the electronic exchange of medical knowledge, which is now a commonplace source of information for any disease. It is a curious coincidence that the burgeoning of the HIV pandemic has been paralleled by the exponential expansion of the internet. The downside is that the worldwide web is also a superb medium through which to perpetuate myths of HIV denial (or blame and conspiracy theories) concerning AIDS. It is a tragedy that these siren voices of the so-called AIDS dissidents won the sympathy of the leader of a nation with more HIV-infected people than any other, despite our efforts to correct the situation [9] [10] [11] .",

Because virus replication was associated with reverse transcriptase (RT) activity, it was assumed to be a retrovirus (Fig. 1) . This virus was cytopathic and it could be propagated seriallywith tender loving care and to low titre -only by adding medium harvested from dying cultues to fresh cultures of activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). We would now call Bru a primary 'R5' isolate because it has a tropism for primary T cells and macrophages that express CCR5, and it will not grow in T cell lines that express CXCR4.",

Indeed, an accompanying paper in the same issue of Science from Bob Gallo's and Max Essex's groups suggested another type of retrovirus, human T cell leukaemia virus (HTLV-1), as a possible cause of AIDS [12, 13] . The detection of HTLV-1 was genuine enough, but in hindsight it turned out to be a 'passenger' virus in about 10% of patients with immunodeficiency. By April 1984, Montagnier's group had published on further HIV isolates [14] , including one from an AIDS patient 'Lai' that grew to much higher titre and which we now call an 'X4' isolate because it can grow in T cell leukaemic cell lines expressing CXCR4. In addition, Montagnier's electron microscopic study [15] indicated that HIV resembled animal lentiviruses rather than deltaviruses such as HTLV-1. This interpretation was vindicated firmly in 1985, when Simon Wain-Hobson and colleagues sequenced and interpreted correctly the open reading frames of the genomes of both HIV and the prototype lentivirus, Maedi-Visna virus (MVV), of sheep [16, 17] .",

Each group gave their virus a different name. Eventually DNA cloning and genome sequencing (which were still labourious processes) confirmed that all these viruses belonged to a single species, but revealed that genuinely different isolates were surprisingly variable in sequence. This genome diversity later allowed Wain-Hobson to perform a neat forensic DNA analysis on how the Lai isolate had become an opportunistic contaminating agent in several laboratories, including mine [20] . The AIDS virus was variously called LAV [1] , IDAV [14] , HTLV-III [18] and ARV [19] . The term HIV was not coined until 1986, when an international committee chaired by Harold Varmus sought to rationalize the confusing terminology [21] .",

We found that both viruses grew to high titre in the CEM T cell line, and with Richard Tedder we established a competition radioimmune assay [22] employing HIV antigens from CEM cells to detect serum antibodies in British patients with AIDS and subjects in AIDS risk groups collected by Brian Gazzard, Tony Pinching, Jonathan Weber and Ian Weller. The same samples reacted positively to both viruses, just as Levy [19] had found for LAV and ARV, so we performed a simple, old-fashioned experiment using immunofluorescence: when antibodies were absorbed onto excess cells infected with HTLV-III, all reactivity to Lai was also removed from the serum sample [22] .",

In 1984, patients with symptoms similar to HIV had been noted in both sexes in Congo [23] and Rwanda [24] , and Montagnier's group had isolated HIV from one of them [25] . In Uganda, people realized that a novel affliction had first appeared among them in 1982 in the wake of Milton Obote's army, which liberated the country from Idi Amin's grip and opened up the truck routes for traders. They called it 'Slim' disease because the wasting syndrome and diarrhoea were its most notable symptoms. Although KS had always been a relatively frequent tumour in Africa, a new aggressive form in young adults had sprung up. Together with Anne Bayley in Lusaka and David Serwadda and Nelson Sewankambo in Kampala, we showed by serology that both aggressive KS [26] and Slim disease [27] were associated with HIV infection. At first we thought that our antibody test was not sufficiently specific because 10% of the control sera taken from healthy hospital staff yielded positive results [27] . It was an awesome moment when the penny dropped and we realized that they really were infected.",

However, it was found that HIV-1, like hepatitis B virus, was able to infect only chimpanzees, and even these close relatives to humans did not succumb to AIDS. As a Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna endangered species, experimental infection of the great apes was soon embargoed. Therefore, simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIV) of macaques became one of the few experimental models of HIV, and more recently recombinant hybrid HIV/SIV viruses known as SHIV have been developed for challenge tests of vaccines. It is worth recalling that SIVmac was not discovered until 1985 [29] , that is, 2 years after HIV-1, and feline immunodeficiency virus at around the same time. One can state without too much irony that HIV has been a great model for veterinary lentivirus infections. Natural infection of chimpanzees by SIVcpz was not discovered until the 1990s. The genome organization and sequence similarity to HIV-1 revealed SIVcpz to be the natural precursor of HIV-1. Recent investigations indicate which chimpanzee subspecies in which location (Gabon) is likely to have been the origin of HIV-1 Group M, the pandemic strain [30] , whereas Group O-related SIV is present both in chimpanzees and gorillas [31] . Like SIVcpz becoming HIV-1 [32] , SIVsm has only recently crossed species from the sooty mangabey to rhesus and cynomolgus macaques (SIVmac) and to humans (HIV-2). The emergence of SIVmac occurred in captivity, presumably when African and Asian species were housed together in primate centres in the United States. Again, like HIV-1, SIVmac is pathogenic in its new host, whereas SIVsm causes little harm to mangabeys.",

Then in 1986 Montagnier's group isolated HIV-2 successfully from patients in the Cap Verde islands and Senegal [34] . It appears that SIVsm has transferred from mangabeys to humans in West Africa on at least six occasions. HIV-2 is said to be less pathogenic than HIV-1 in humans, with a much slower progression to AIDS. This is, in a sense, true and HIV-2 tends to have a lower viral load, is less transmissible and mother-to-child transmission has not been demonstrated. However, the development of AIDS is bimodal: the majority of HIV-2 infected people in West Africa do not become ill (they are genuine long-term nonprogressors), whereas a minority progress to AIDS at much the same rate as untreated HIV-1-infected individuals [35] . Whether the virus or the host are determinants of the different courses of infection is not yet understood, and in my opinion HIV-2 research merits further attention.",

With no treatment for infection, the benefit of any of these to the individual of knowing their HIV status was debatable. For screening blood donors, however, there was an immediate public health benefit. Antibody detection still left a period between infection and seroconversion during which an individual became infectious to others. This window was first filled by testing for p24 antigen in plasma, and subsequently Twenty-five years of HIV with the development of RT-PCR detection for viral genomes. Quantitative RT-PCR and related techniques led to the measurement of plasma viral load, which proved to be a useful prognostic marker and guide to clinical management after effective anti-retroviral drugs combinations were introduced. Later, genotypic markers of drug resistance also proved their worth. Thus molecular techniques for detection, quantification and characterization of viral genomes have played an important role in screening and in treatment.",

However, the Anglo-French Concorde trial showed that the drop in viral load and benefit to the patient was short-lived owing to the rapid emergence of Zidovudine-resistant HIV mutants in vivo [37] . Further RT inhibitors and protease inhibitors were introduced, and recently cell-entry inhibitors and integrase inhibitors have been licensed.

Thus it was soon found that AIDS was associated with a disappearance of CD4 cells in the peripheral blood [4, 5] . Following the discovery of HIV, David Klatzmann in Paris showed that, in vitro, HIV replicated selectively and caused a cytopathic effect in CD4 cells but not in CD8 cells [44] . This allowed his group [45] and ours [46] to demonstrate that CD4 antigen itself is the binding receptor for HIV. This sequence of findings seems logical in retrospect, but actually we had no reason to think that HIV would use exactly the same marker as that chosen by clinical immunologists for its receptor. Our study [46] benefited from a fruitful collaboration between such as Peter Beverley and Mel Greaves, and immunologists virologists such as Dorothy Crawford and myself. We used all the lymphocyte cell surface markers available at the timesome 160 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to CD and other antigens [including 14 anti-CD4 mAbs]to pinpoint CD4.",

The first clue came from Gallo's laboratory which found that CC chemokines regulated uopn activation normal T cell expressed and secreted (CCL5) and macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-aP (CCL3) inhibited HIV infection [48] . Then Ed Berger at NIH discovered, through expression cloning, that CXCR4 is the co-receptor on T cell lines [49] , followed quickly by the identification of CCR5 as the co-receptor on PBMC and macrophages [50] . Identifying CCR5 as the co-receptor for the majority of transmissible strains of HIV led to the development of entry inhibitors and to discerning CCR5 polymorphisms as resistance factors, discussed later.",

I would postulate, therefore, that the wasting syndrome as well as AIDS dementia is essentially a disease of macrophages in human AIDS.

In England, Stella Knight had claimed since the 1980s that HIV infects DC [54] but was disbelieved by Ralph Steinman, although he is now a convert [55] . This controversy has been resolved largely by discerning a differential sensitivity of two types of DC, plasmacytoid (pDC) and meyloid (mDC), just as the distinction between CD4 and CD8 T lymphocytes two decades earlier helped to pinpoint which was susceptible to HIV infection [44] . In London, Steve Patterson showed that mDC express CD4 and CCR5 and hence support HIV entry and replication, whereas pDC allow binding of HIV to DC-SIGN without viral replication [56] , except possibly by X4 strains during maturation. Nevertheless, the attachment HIV to DC-SIGN allows pDC to deliver HIV to susceptible CD4 T cells upon migration to the lymph nodes. The immunological synapse between pDC and CD4 + cells not only activates the T helper lymphocyte (making it more permissive to HIV replication) but also delivers the HIV particles across the synapse [57] .",

There are, however, other features that may contribute to fall in viral load. The role of humoral immunity tends to be ignored because neutralizing antibodies appear only some months after seroconversion; but we forget that neutralization assays represent an artificial, in vitro measure of 'protective' antibodies. In vivo, antibodies circulate in a pool of complement (C\u2032). My colleagues Marlen Aasa-Chapman et al. [65] have shown that C\u2032-mediated HIV inactivation (lysis of the viral envelope) by specific anti-gp41 and anti-gp120 antibodies occurs concomitantly with the appearance of cytotoxic lymphocytes and the fall in viral load. These findings have been corroborated by Alexandra Trkola's group [66] . Similar non-neutralizing antibodies may also destroy HIV-infected cells through anti-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. Thus a humoral component in the clearance of primary infection merits serious consideration.",

For example, why do X4 variants arise late in infection, and why are they seen more frequently in western patients infected with Clade B strains of HIV? It is thought that X4 viruses are more pathogenic than R5 strains and are therefore harbingers of AIDS; but this is a chickenand-egg dilemma. I would argue that X4 strains are 'opportunistic' infections that emerge because immune control diminishes. Such viruses appear to be relatively unfit for person-to-person transmission and they are more sensitive to immune control, particularly to humoral immunity. Once they do emerge, however, they may well exacerbate immune deficiency, analogous to other persistent virus infections. As my colleague Paul Griffiths has shown, cytomegalovirus is both an opportunist and a driver of AIDS [71] .",

On the other hand, the restriction factor Trim5a discovered in macaques [74] , while polymorphic in humans, acts more to restrict zoonoses; that is, the risk of SIV transferring to humans [75] . Despite a report on human single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for Trim5a [76] they do not appear to have a marked affect on HIV or AIDS [77] . Similarly, human variation in gene for the restriction factor APOBECG3 has not revealed major changes in susceptibility, as the Vif protein of all HIV-1 strains seems able to abrogate its restrictive effects [78] .

The most dramatic illustration of receptor polymorphism came rapidly after the discovery that CCR5 was the major co-receptor for HIV. It was found that several long-term exposed, uninfected people in unprotected sexual relationships with HIV + partners were homozygous for a 32 basepair deletion in the CCR5 gene. The CCR5D32 homozygotes lived in good health without a functional CCR5 protein, but were genetically resistant to infection by HIV [81] . The few homozygous individuals who became HIV-positive carried X4 variants of the virus. Individuals who are heterozygous CCR5D32 are susceptible to infection (although probably at a lower risk) but have a significantly slower rate of disease progression. The CCR5D32 mutation is found only in Caucasians of European descent. There has been speculation as to whether a previous pandemic pathogen such as smallpox or plague might have selected for the mutation's high frequency in Europeans, but there is no strong evidence to implicate a particular pathogen.",
