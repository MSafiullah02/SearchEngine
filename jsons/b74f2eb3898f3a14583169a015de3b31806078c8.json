There has been a recent rise in use of video communication. Apps like Houseparty and Zoom help us socialise from our homes and this idea inspired me to consider other means of group teaching. I therefore arranged a journal club on Microsoft Teams, which took place instead of our usual consultant-led session. We now plan to hold regular video sessions to present and discuss other papers.",

Patients with asthma, renal disease, liver disease, allergy/angioedema, peptic ulcer disease, acute cardiac and stroke risk and cardiac failure are all groups where special caution is required when using NSAID analgesics. They are also not recommended for use into the third trimester of pregnancy. NICE has issued guidance to medical practitioners starting these medicines for longer term or high dose use and dentists would be well advised to look at this guidance until more specific dental focussed information is available. 2 In many of these risk groups paracetamol is a safer alternative.",

High dose ibuprofen should not be used in patients taking aspirin 75 mg/day as it reduces the cardioprotective effect. 3 Dentists should remember that in these risk patients, paracetamol and codeine (co-codamol 8/500) may be preferred to a NSAID and is available over the counter at a pharmacy or",
