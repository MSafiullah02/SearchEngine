            "text": "The various homodimers and heterodimers of NF-\u03baB are kept inactive by association with cytoplasmic inhibitory proteins [28]. They are I\u03baB\u03b1, I\u03baB\u03b2 and I\u03baB\u03b5 and also the p105 and p100 precursors of p50 and p52. Are there roles for the \u03b1-, \u03b2-, \u03b3-subunits of the IKK complex? [29]. IKK\u03b1 is a histone H3 kinase that moves into nuclei to associate with the promoters of NF-\u03baB-responsive genes [30, 31]. IKK\u03b1 contributes to NF-\u03baB DNA binding on gene promoters; thus, it derepresses IL-8, cIAP2 and more. Yet, it creates a negative feed-back loop for NF-kB and macrophage activation [32, 32b, 33]. In fact, IKK\u03b1 resolves inflammation by switching off the canonical pathway. By accelerating turnover of cRel and RelA, IKK\u03b1 attenuates IKK\u03b2 driven NF-\u03baB activation and so inflammation. It can also promote adaptive immunity via the non-canonical pathway [33].",

Phosphorylation-dependent ubiquitination of the p100 is only partial. The N-terminal p52 is released and joins with RelB to enter the nuclei (Fig. 11.2). This alternative path via p52/RelB enables BAFF (BLys) to activate B lymphocytes. The alternative path essentially provides organogenic chemokines [4] for the development of lymphoid tissue [36] and adaptive immunity. The NF-\u03baB2 is also required for establishment of thymic central tolerance through an Aire-dependent pathway [37]. AIRE is the autoimmune regulator gene, and NF-\u03baB2 is required in medullary thymic epithelial cells.\n",

Acting on receptor rank on bone stromal cells, Rankl stimulates their NFATc1 and c-fos so that osteoclasts are formed. This activation is reinforced by Ca2+-calmodulin (CaM) stimulation of NFATc and of CaM kinase IV, which stimulates cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) on the promoter for osteoclast marker genes. NIK has been shown by the study of mouse knockouts to control the activities of lymphocytes and osteoclasts in inflammatory arthritis [39]. NIK\u2212/\u2212 mice have no peripheral lymph nodes, defective T and B cells and impaired Rankl-induced osteoclastogenesis. One might also be interested that when ultraviolet light acts on skin to cause immunosuppression by induction of Treg cells, Rankl on keratinocytes first stimulates Rank on Langerhans cells. Vitamin D3, which is immunosuppressive, also induces Rankl [40].",

            "text": "All NF-\u03baB activation pathways share the proteasome-mediated step (Fig. 11.1 Structures of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB) family members. All five NF-\u03baB members are related through the conserved Rel homology domain (RHD), which contains sequences for DNA binding, dimerization, inhibitor association and nuclear localization. The members c-Rel, RelA and RelB contain a C-terminal transactivation domain (TAD). The function of the TADs is enhanced by phosphorylation and acetylation. The second group (the p105/p50 and p100/p52) arises as precursors p100 and p105 that are partially proteolysed by the 26S proteasome to yield the mature p52 and p50 units. They contain C-terminal sequences with inhibitory ankyrin (ANK) repeats, and this means that they can also function as unit I-kappa B (I\u03baBs) and retain Rel proteins in the cytoplasm. The five to seven ankyrin repeats of inhibitory I\u03baB proteins interact with NF-\u03baB dimers and mask their nuclear localization signals (NLSs)) that causes the degradation of the inhibitory proteins. Posttranslational modifications like phosphorylation [42], acetylation [43] or prolyl isomerization modulate the activity of the p65 (or p50) subunits. Thus, acetylation of multiple lysine residues by p300/CBF acetyltransferases (Fig. 4.8) modifies the behaviour of NF-\u03baB components. Acetylation works as an intranuclear molecular switch [44]. Acetylation of p65 stops inhibition by I\u03baB\u03b1 and controls nuclear NF-\u03baB. Oxidative stress, via its formation of H2O2, which enhances degradation of I\u03baB\u03b1, enhances NF-\u03baB activity [22b]; thus, macrophages have increased production of cyclooxygenase 2 (Cox-2), prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), and matrix metalloproteinase 1 (MMP-1) [45].",

Significant fluctuation in p50 levels can alter the abundance and composition of NF-\u03baB complexes within a cell. When animals or cells are exposed to repeated small doses of LPS, the output of cytokines via NF-\u03baB activation is thwarted, and the animals or cells show endotoxin tolerance. The explanation is that p50/p50 homodimers are formed instead of the p65/p50, and the consequence is suppression of NF-\u03baB-inducible genes [46]. p65 has a transactivation domain, whereas p50 does not. p50/p50 homodimers (as produced by IL-10 or by protein kinase A) are inhibitory. Cells that are tolerant to endotoxin still respond to LPS with the degradation of I\u03baB and nuclear translocation of p50 and p65. Yet, they cannot form IL-1\u03b2. In such cells, it was found that RelB represses inflammatory gene expression [47]. Alternatively, in endotoxin tolerance, mobilization of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) into lipid rafts is curtailed [48].",

            "text": "p53 turns out to be a buffer of the innate immune system because p53 works as an antagonist of NF-\u03baB to dampen chronic inflammation. p53null macrophages show very high release of cytokines IL-1, IL-6 and IL-12 in response to LPS or IFN\u03b3. In fact, p53 downregulates Stat1 and proinflammatory cytokines [49]. In some cells, like leucocytes, I\u03baB\u03b6 negatively regulates intranuclear NF-\u03baB activity [50]. We have noted how LPS exposure can attenuate TNF\u03b1 gene transcription because NF-\u03baB p50 homodimers bind to the TNF\u03b1 promoter. In addition, LPS induces Bcl-3 (B cell lymphoma 3), which is an anti-inflammatory regulator [32b,51]. Bcl-3 is only located in cell nuclei, and it associates with p50/p50 homodimers and acts as a negative regulator of TLR signalling [52]. Bcl-3 reduces transcription of proinflammatory cytokines. It mediates some of the anti-inflammatory activities of IL-10 (Sect. 12.16) Bcl-6 is another transcriptional repressor protein. Repression by Bcl-6 is cell-type specific. Bcl-6 negatively regulates the expression of the NF-\u03baB1 p105/p50 subunit. In macrophages, it negatively regulates the chemokines monocyte chemotactic peptide 1 (MCP-1), MCP-3 and MIP-1 [53]. Indeed, in Bcl-6\u2212/\u2212 mice there is florid T helper lymphocyte Th2-mediated inflammation. Bcl-6 is essential for formation of germinal centres and for a normal antibody response [54]. Bcl-6 suppresses p53 expression in germinal centre B lymphocytes. Bcl-6 interacts with TF Miz-1 to suppress p21 and thus to allow proliferation of germinal centre B cells [55]. Activating mutations or chromosomal translocations that affect Bcl-6 are relevant to B cell lymphomas [56, 57]. The t (3;14) translocation affecting Bcl-6 is part of diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL).",

Hence, cytokine production via NF-\u03baB is suppressed [58]. Clearly, inflammatory reactions at the gut mucosa can cause much trouble. Hence, note that local GI macrophages show downregulation of their TREM1 (triggering receptors expressed on myeloid cell 1)-activating receptors. TREM would amplify cytokine-induced responses. This is explained by the local environment, in which there is plentiful IL-10 (suppressive cytokine) and transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF\u03b2) [59].",

            "text": "The involvement of effector molecules in physiological or pathological processes can now be elucidated or confirmed by the use of gene knockout (ko) or transgenic (tg) mice, into which an extra gene is inserted. Already, examples have been mentioned. Mouse models that lack almost all the known genes for G protein \u03b1-subunits have been generated to give insight into G protein signal pathways. G\u03b1q-deficient platelets fail to aggregate in response to thrombin, adenosine diphosphate (ADP) or thromboxane A2 (TxA2) due to lack of agonist-induced phospholipase C activation. Mice lacking G\u03b1q have increased bleeding times and are protected against thromboembolism. Mice with knockout of gene granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) develop silting of the lungs by \u201calveolar proteinosis\u201d, which is a clear indication of the cause of this rare condition. Transgenic mice that overexpress phospholipase A2, which generates leukotrienes and platelet-activating factor (PAF) (Fig. 6.2b), develop exuberant atherosclerosis. They show enhanced oxidation of their plasma low-density lipoprotein (LDL). Mice that lack neutrophil elastase (NE) cannot clear infections with intracellular bacteria [77]. Mice deficient in cathepsin G succumb to Staphylococcus aureus [78]. The subtleties of NF-\u03baB controls are gradually being elucidated by techniques like this (cf. [79]). B lymphocytes with RelA\u2212/\u2212 deficiency were killed easily by exposure to TNF\u03b1 since they had reduced expression of Flice (i.e. caspase 8) and of Bcl-2 antiapoptotic protein. Clearly, NF-\u03baB enables B cell survival by eliminating the effects of TNF\u03b1 toxicity. This may remind one that c-Flip, inhibitor of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway, is known to promote NF-\u03baB signalling and cell survival [80]. RNA interference (RNAi) is a mechanism for sequence-specific posttranscriptional inhibition of gene expression acting on double-stranded RNA molecules. Small interfering RNAs can be applied to mammalian cells. Thus, RNAi was used to show how phospholipase D (PLD-1) colocalises with actin filaments at the adhesive surfaces of macrophages [81]. RNAi has been used to assess the role of p50 NF-\u03baB1 protein in the maturation of monocyte-derived DCs. siRNA for p50 reduces the transcription of IL-12 p40. Absence of NF-\u03baB1 p50 or of c-Rel leads to impaired survival of DCs and lack of IL-12 production. IL-12 production in macrophages is blocked when the IFN\u03b3 receptor or the TNFRI are removed by gene deletions in mice. NF-\u03baB2, p52, derived from precursor p100, when eliminated in knockout mice, results in DCs with enhanced RelB activity. Enhanced RelB is accompanied by enhanced MHC class II molecule expression on APCs and an increased ability to induce CD4 lymphocytes (Table 11.3).\n",

This is similar to induction of cytokines. Consider the situation when Helicobacter pylori causes chronic gastritis. Study of TFs in gastric epithelial cells showed Cox-2 promoter induction by NF-\u03baB, AP-1 and C/EBP (NF-IL-6) [85].

Proinflammatory mediators can activate ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK), which enhances C/EBP\u03b2 binding to the Cox-2 promoter.

In a second phase, IL-1 stabilizes the Cox-2 messenger RNA (mRNA), which it does by silencing of the binding protein ARE; thus, there is enhanced translation [88]. Induction of Cox-2 in macrophages is also biphasic and requires C/EBP\u03b2 and C/EBP\u03b4 TFs [89]. Conserved elements in the macrophage Cox-2 gene promoter as revealed by analysis after exposure to LPS are \u2013CRE2/NF-\u03baB-C/EBP/AP-1/CRE1/E-box\u2013TATA. The E-box mediates transcriptional repression, whilst the other cis-elements are activating. At 6 h after LPS administration, Cox-2 gene transcription was completely dependent on phospho-c-Jun along with the p50 of NF-\u03baB [90].

Hence, cancer cells should not emerge. Protein kinase B (Akt) confers the attributes of cell survival [106]. PI3 kinase (PI3K) produces PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 (Fig. 2.6), which binds to Akt so that it can translocate to the cell membrane, where it is phosphorylated by 3-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK-1). When IL-2 acts on immune cells, Akt ensures their survival. Either a growth factor like PDGF (platelet-derived growth factor) or a cytokine like TNF\u03b1 will activate Akt, which then associates with and phosphorylates IKK so that NF-\u03baB is activated. Concurrently, Akt suppresses proapoptotic influences [107]. Akt sequesters the proapoptotic protein Bad, it inhibits caspase 9, and it reduces transcription of Fas ligand (cf. Fig. 8.3). Conversely, since ceramide-activated PKC\u03b6 and protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) negatively regulate the Akt survival pathway [108], this explains how ceramide often mediates cell apoptosis. Nevertheless, the \u03b14-subunit of PP2A (and other phosphatases) works to keep apoptosis in check and to maintain cell survival [109].",

Akt can inactivate (a) death receptor-mediated apoptosis, (b) mitochondrial-dependent apoptosis and (c) p53-induced apoptosis. Akt via Cot serine-threonine kinase activates NF-\u03baB. NF-\u03baB supports antioxidant enzymes. Akt phosphorylates glycogen synthase kinase 3\u03b2 (GSK3\u03b2), ensuring glucose uptake and metabolism. GSK3 is important in embryonic development. When Akt promotes the survival of adult cells, Akt phosphorylates and inhibits GSK3 [110] and thus enables supportive changes in glucose metabolism. GSK3\u03b2 is essential for cell survival, but too much or too little will cause apoptosis. On the one hand, components of the NF-\u03baB system are phosphorylated by GSK3 to promote NF-\u03baB activity. Conversely, if p53 binds nuclear GSK3, it is activated and promotes the transcriptional and apoptotic actions of p53 [111]. GSK3 supports formation of proinflammatory cytokines by inducing NF-\u03baB and CREB interaction with coactivator CBP. GSK3 inhibitors are thus anti-inflammatory [112].",

            "text": "Both growth factor and cytokine survival factors for cells, like insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) or IL-3 activate Akt, which phosphorylates Bad at three sites, and it then binds 14-3-3 protein, and it (Bad) is sequestered in the cytosol. So, apoptosis cannot occur. When macrophages meet endotoxin, they have to survive. When LPS interacts with TLR4 receptors (Figs. 12.2, 12.5), RIP links TLR4 to PI3K and so to Akt and cell survival [113]. Monocyte survival derives from surface CEACAM1 (CD66a), which connects with PI3K and hence to Akt activation. Insulin growth factors I and II direct protein anabolism, and they are mitogens. Haemopoietic cells that are destined to die when IL-2 or IL-3 is withdrawn are protected by IGF-1. IGF-1 is antiapoptotic for many cells [114], and in many cancers an autophosphorylated IGF-1R (IGF-1 receptor) mediates antiapoptosis. The \u00adbiochemical scenario is that when IGF-1 acts on its IGF-1R there is recruitment of a docking protein insulin receptor substrate 2 (IRS-2) (as for insulin) and that leads to activation of PI3K. PI3K activates a PDK-1, and in turn that activates Akt kinase. Naturally, the kinase-regulated signalling pathways are controlled by phosphatases. One is calcineurin, which will dephosphorylate Bad and so reverse the effect of Akt phosphorylation. The other is PTEN (phosphatase as in Fig. 2.6), the product of a tumour suppressor gene [115, 116]. The function of PTEN is to hydrolyze 3-phosphorylated inositol phospholipids [117]. Thus, PTEN acts in opposition to PI3K (Fig. 2.6). In malignancies, both copies of PTEN are deleted or mutated. Loss of PTEN in cells leads to Akt drive, and this is accompanied by resistance of cells to apoptotic stimuli [118]. Hence, cancer is likely to arise.",

Yet, the JNK cascade can work in opposition to the (GADD45) and Xiap proteins, which promote antiapoptosis [120] (Table 11.3). Likewise, the p38 MAP kinase pathway is proapoptotic [121, 122]. Actually, induction of NF-\u03baB in some cells enables them to stay alive long enough to acquire genetic errors. Hence, NF-\u03baB activity can promote carcinogenesis [5] and help metastases [123]. Such carcinogenesis is oxygen radical mediated [124]. Yet generally, NF-\u03baB is acting to suppress tumour cell growth for it aids triggering of p53 and ARF (Fig. 17.5).

Whereas glucose elicits proinflammatory effects, insulin is anti-inflammatory for its action suppresses NF-\u03baB, AP-1 and early growth response 1 (EGR-1) TFs. Of course, insulin is a principal pancreatic autoantigen relevant to diabetes [126]. Yet, one could be interested in how signalling by the insulin receptors compares with other mechanisms discussed in this text. Insulin receptor stimulation in insulin-responsive cells leads to translocation of GLUT4 and glucose transport. The insulin receptor is an \u03b12\u03b22 heterotetrameric complex in which two \u03b1-subunits and two \u03b2-subunits are linked by disulphide bonds. Insulin binds to the extracellular \u03b1-subunits, and it thereby transmits a signal across the plasma membrane that activates the intracellular tyrosine kinase of the \u03b2-subunit. The one \u03b2-subunit phosphorylates its partner on specific tyrosine residues. Accordingly, the receptor tyrosine kinase induces phosphorylation of IRSs on multiple tyrosine residues. These IRS phosphotyrosine residues act as docking sites for \u2212SH2 domain containing proteins, including the p85 regulatory unit of PI3K (Fig. 2.7). Hence, the p110 catalytic unit of PI3K, the lipid kinase unit, will lead to glucose transport [127, 128]. Other proteins that dock at the insulin receptor include adaptor proteins Shc and Grb2 (growth factor receptor-bound protein), leading to Ras-MAP kinase signalling for the mitogenic action of insulin, the SHP2 phosphatase [129] and Cbl (casitas B lineage lymphoma protein).",

The plasma membrane target for the GLUT4 vesicle is the t-SNARE called syntaxin 4. Inactivation of Glut4 in muscle leads to raised plasma glucose and glucose toxicity that results in insulin resistance [131].

TNF\u03b1-induced insulin resistance involves activation of inhibitory serine kinases or tyrosine phosphatases, which inhibit the insulin signalling path. It works through H2O2 generation. Also, there is serine phosphorylation of IRS-1, rather than IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation, that causes reduced insulin receptor kinase \u00adactivity. In skeletal muscle, TNF\u03b1 inhibits Akt phosphorylation, causing insulin resistance [136]. Ceramide, by blocking insulin stimulation of Akt, leads to insulin resistance [137]. TNF\u03b1 can also produces insulin resistance in skeletal muscle by activation of I\u03baB kinase inhibitor of NF-\u03baB in a p38-dependent manner [138]. Most particularly there is upregulated JNK which impairs the action of IRS 1/2 [138b].",

In fact, PI3K, ERK and JNK as activated by AngII catalyse the serine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor and the IRS-1, and indeed of PI3K, impairing insulin-promoted activation toward Akt. Hence, in contrast to the effect of insulin, IRS-1/2-associated PI3K activity, and thereby endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) activity, is inhibited by Ang II in a dose-dependent manner [148]. So, insulin-induced vasodilatation is thwarted by Ang II. Furthermore, Ang II induces SOCS3 activity to impair signal transduction through the Jak2/Stat5 signal pathway [149].",

            "text": "mTOR is mammalian target of rapamycin. It is an integrator of cellular energy status, nutrient and growth factor signals and the coordinator of cell growth and cell cycle progression [150]. TOR directs cell surface expression of various nutrient transporters. Amino acids also stimulate mTOR via the class 3 PI3Ks [151]. Since insulin and IGF-1 are anabolic, Fig. 11.6 shows how those receptors connect via IRS proteins to activation of PI3K and hence Akt. In its turn, Akt phosphorylates and inhibits substrates like the Foxo (Forkhead TFs), Bad, GSK3 and tuberin or hamartin. Tuberin, characteristic of benign tumours called hamartomas as seen in tuberose sclerosis [152, 153], inhibits TOR, but tuberin is inhibited by Akt. This means that Akt activity stimulates glucose uptake and cell growth and proliferation, and apoptosis is inhibited. Actually, mTOR exerts negative feedback on PDGF receptors [154]. The TOR pathway requires nutrients like the amino acid leucine, and then Tor complex 1 (mTORC1) activates S6 kinase and promotes the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) [155]. Additionally, mTORC2 regulates polarization of the actin cytoskeleton. Furthermore, should cell ATP levels fall, the energy-sensing kinase AMPK inhibits hepatic gluconeogenesis (Fig. 1.1) because it promotes TORC2 phosphorylation, which blocks its nuclear accumulation [156]. AMPK is a fuel sensor. In muscle AMPK is activated by exercise [157]. It is a key metabolic regulator in liver, heart and muscle. AMPK is activated by cell cAMP, and it will stimulate fatty acid \u03b2-oxidation. That means that if hepatic AMPK is inactivated, as occurs in diabetes, there is fatty acid synthesis and development of hyperlipidaemia. In T cells, AMPK controls metabolic steps required for cell proliferation [158].\n",

In fact, AMs have two survival pathways: (a) the PI3K \u2192 Akt pathway and (b) ERK activity that leads to inhibition of proapoptotic proteins but good antiapoptosis. The Hunninghake group [168] investigated how it is that ERK activity leads to sustained protein translation initiation via eIF4E or hypophosphorylated (active) eIF2\u03b1. Actually, ERK decreases proapoptotic JNK activity by stabilizing MPK7 dual phosphatase. When JNK activity is low, there is higher activity of phosphatase PP1\u03b1. Accordingly, there is hypophosphorylation of translation initiation factor eIF2\u03b1, so there is ongoing protein translation that means survival of the AMs.",

Microbial products or cytokines that induce NF-\u03baB trigger phosphorylation of unit I-kappa B (I\u03baB) kinase (IKK) -\u03b1 and -\u03b2. The heterodimers IKK\u03b1 or -\u03b2 then bind to the regulatory IKK\u03b3, Nemo, and each heterodimer [1] phosphorylates the I\u03baB inhibitory proteins, so that they undergo proteasomal degradation. NF-\u03baB p50, p65 is then freed and will move into the nuclei. With regard to the role of ubiquitination [2, 3], it regulates three steps: (a) degradation of the inhibitor I\u03baB, (b) processing of the NF-\u03baB precursors and (c) Traf 6 ubiquitination, which activates the IKK. Proteasomes are implicated in NF-\u03baB activation: (a) in generation of p50 from the precursor p105 and (b) in the degradation of I\u03baB\u03b1. Types I and II interferons induce immunoproteasomes in which the reactions are much quicker. Calpain activates NF-\u03baB since it degrades the PEST (proline, glutamate, serine, threonine) sequence in the inhibitor I\u03baB \u03b1b.",
