The host immune system has evolved mechanisms to tolerate these commensal organisms while at the same time providing protection for the host from pathogens. Therefore, not surprisingly, extensive crosstalk exists between the host and the luminal environment of the intestine. In addition to the widely recognized role of commensal bacteria, other types of microbes including viruses participate in this crosstalk. Recent work has begun to define the intestinal virome and to determine its functional interactions with other microbes and the host in health and various disease states.",

Viral discovery has been enabled partly by advances in the DNA sequencing technology and bioinformatic analysis. Some technical challenges still exist including methods of sample preparation, selection of the sequencing method and informatics analysis. For collections, many investigators attempt to enrich for viral-like particles through filtration and DNase/RNase treatment. However, this method clearly only creates partial enrichment as there are still ample contaminating host and bacterial reads. Some groups have used nucleic acid extraction kits for RNA/DNA while others have focused on DNA extraction. Multiple sequencing modalities have been used including shotgun 454 and Illumina sequencing [1, 2, 3\u2022\u2022, 4\u2022].",

Analysis of samples from 105 wild rodents in the United States revealed many previously unreported viral species [1], highlighting the limited knowledge in this area. Interestingly, the viruses could be classified in three major groups including mammalian viruses (Circoviridae, Picobirnaviridae, Picornaviridae, Astroviridae, Parvoviridae, Papillomaviridae, Adenoviridae, and Coronaviridae), insect viruses (Densoviridae, Iridoviridae, Polydnaviridae, Dicistroviriade, Bromoviridae, and Virgaviridae), and plant viruses (Nanoviridae, Geminiviridae, Phycodnaviridae, Secoviridae, Partitiviridae, Tymoviridae, Alphaflexiviridae, and Tombusviridae). Similarly, Ge et al. examined viral like particles present in bat fecal samples collected in China [2]. Among the eukaryotic viruses, the most frequent reads were related to vertebrate viruses (coronaviruses, parvoviruses), insect viruses (densoviruses, dicistroviruses), and plant viruses (tobamoviruses). One interpretation of these data is that the substantial contribution of insect and plant viruses in these fecal viromes reflects the largely insect and plant diets of these animals. Whether these viruses affect the physiology of the rodent host has yet to be determined.",

Consistent with the results seen by Reyes et al., they found robust intrapersonal stability and interpersonal variation, with a high representation of bacteriophages. Furthermore, this interpersonal variation was present even among individuals on the same diet, suggesting that the vast majority of phage populations are not acquired via a daily transient means such as food intake. Interestingly, the proportions of pre-existing viral populations were found to be significantly changed after alteration of diet. Thus, the virome composition does respond to diet through as yet unclear mechanisms.",

            "text": "Though the interaction of NOD2 and bacterial products has been known for some time, recent work has shown the involvement of NOD2 in the detection of viral products as well. Using several different cell lines, Sabbah et al. showed that treatment with synthetic ssRNA or infection with different ssRNA viruses can lead to increased expression and activation of NOD2, resulting in IFN\u03b2 production via MAVS and IRF3 [22]. This Type I IFN response was abrogated in cells lacking NOD2. Interestingly, this effect was greater at earlier time points compared to late. It is thought that other PRRs such as RIG-I may activate the IRF3-IFN pathway at the later time points, whereas NOD2 may act in an earlier role. In addition, the authors showed that NOD2 was able to associate with viral RNA but not control host RNA in an immunoprecipitation assay. Nod2 was also found to interact with MAVS via the leucine-rich-region of the nucleotide binding domain. Finally, Nod2\n\u2212/\u2212 mice failed to efficiently produce interferon after infection, which corresponded with increased viral titers and enhanced susceptibility to virus-induced pathogenesis.",

This family of cytokines is composed of 16 members (12 IFN\u03b1 subtypes, IFN\u03b2, IFN\u025b, IFN\u03ba, and IFN\u03c9) and signal through a common heterodimeric receptor (IFN\u03b1\u03b2 receptor or IFNAR) [24]. Not only can type I IFNs be produced by almost every cell type, but the receptor is expressed ubiquitously as well. Receptor binding leads to phosphorylation of Janus kinase 1 (JAK1) and non-receptor tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2), resulting in activation of several signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) family members. In the case of STAT1 and STAT2 activation, IRF9 is recruited to form the transcription factor complex IFN-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3) [24, 25]. ISGF3 translocates into the nucleus, binds to IFN-stimulated response elements (ISREs) leading to transcription of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) that play an important antiviral role.",

This family of cytokines consists of IFN-\u03bb1 (IL-29), IFN-\u03bb2 (IL-28A), and IFN-\u03bb3 (IL-28B). Although distantly related to type I IFNs (15\u201320% amino acid identity), type III IFNs were also shown to be induced by viral infection and exhibited antiviral activity [28]. The IFN-\u03bbs signal through a heterodimeric receptor complex (IL-10R\u03b2 and IL-28R\u03b1) that is distinct from the type I IFN receptor complex, but both have similar intracellular signaling pathways (see above) resulting in functionally similar biological activities. As a result, signaling via type III IFNs leads to a type I IFN-like gene expression profile. Early experiments showed that many cell types could express both Type I and Type III IFNs in response to viral infection or TLR stimulation. However, a major difference was found to lie in the cell type able to respond to these different IFNs. While most nucleated cells are able to response to type I IFNs, the type III IFN receptor complex expressing cells are limited to a smaller subset including pDCs, keratinocytes, and epithelial cells of the respiratory, reproductive and gastrointestinal tracts. In addition, initial studies seem to indicate that most of the functions elicited by IFN-\u03bbs were redundant to the type I IFN responses, and IFN-\u03bbs alone were not sufficient to protect against systemic virus infections.",

However, mice lacking IL-28R\u03b1 (but not IFNAR1) lacked expression of downstream IFN response genes in the epithelial cells. These mice also showed increased viral antigen in the epithelial cells, increased viral antigen in feces, and resulted in more severe pathology. In addition, these authors show that the treatment of suckling mice with IFN-\u03bb before oral infection repressed rotavirus replication in gut, whereas treatment of type I IFN was not effective.

Conventionally raised mice were treated with an antibiotic cocktail for 4 weeks before intranasal challenge with a sublethal dose of A/PR8 influenza virus. These antibiotic-treated mice showed decreased titers of virus-specific antibody, impaired CD4/CD8 T cell responses, and increased pulmonary viral titers at day 9 post infection. Interestingly, administration of TLR ligands locally (intranasal) and distally (intrarectal) at the time of influenza infection were both able to restore the antibody and T cell responses in the antibiotic-treated mice. In addition, the antibiotic-treated mice showed reduced pro-IL-1\u03b2 and pro-IL-18 expression as well as decreased IL-1\u03b2 secretion after infection with the virus. Taken together, these data support the idea that the commensal microbiota provides a critical first signal needed for expression of the pro forms of these cytokines at steady state, thereby priming the system for a second signal (virus infection), leading to activation of the inflammasome and maturation/release of these cytokines.",

Mice re-derived in an enhanced barrier facility no longer showed Paneth cell abnormalities, but oral inoculation with a persistent strain of murine norovirus (MNV; CR6), led to the appearance of abnormal Paneth cells in Atg16L1 hypomorphic mice by day 7 post-infection. Furthermore, features of dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced damage that were reminiscent of human Crohn's disease were also triggered by MNV CR6.
