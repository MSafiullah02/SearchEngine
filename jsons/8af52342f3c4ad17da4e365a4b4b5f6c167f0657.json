We used multivariable logistic regression models with multiple imputation to identify risk factors for positive SARS-CoV-2 tests within this surveillance network. Findings We identified 3802 SARS-CoV-2 test results, of which 587 were positive. In multivariable analysis, male sex was independently associated with testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 (296 [18\u00b74%] of 1612 men vs 291 [13\u00b73%] of 2190 women; adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1\u00b755, 95% CI 1\u00b727-1\u00b789). Adults were at increased risk of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 compared with children, and people aged 40-64 years were at greatest risk in the multivariable model (243 [18\u00b75%] of 1316 adults aged 40-64 years vs 23 [4\u00b76%] of 499 children; adjusted OR 5\u00b736, 95% CI 3\u00b728-8\u00b776). Compared with white people, the adjusted odds of a positive test were greater in black people (388 [15\u00b75%] of 2497 white people vs 36 [62\u00b71%] of 58 black people; adjusted OR 4\u00b775, 95% CI 2\u00b765-8\u00b751). People living in urban areas versus rural areas (476 [26\u00b72%] of 1816 in urban areas vs 111 [5\u00b76%] of 1986 in rural areas; adjusted OR 4\u00b759, 95% CI 3\u00b757-5\u00b790) and in more deprived areas (197 [29\u00b75%] of 668 in most deprived vs 143 [7\u00b77%] of 1855 in least deprived; adjusted OR 2\u00b703, 95% CI 1\u00b751-2\u00b771) were more likely to test positive. People with chronic kidney disease were more likely to test positive in the adjusted analysis (68 [32\u00b79%] of 207 with chronic kidney disease vs 519 [14\u00b74%] of 3595 without; adjusted OR 1\u00b791, 95% CI 1\u00b731-2\u00b778), but there was no significant association with other chronic conditions in that analysis. We found increased odds of a positive test among people who are obese (142 [20\u00b79%] of 680 people with obesity vs 171 [13\u00b72%] of 1296 normal-weight people; adjusted OR 1\u00b741, 95% CI 1\u00b704-1\u00b791). Notably, active smoking was linked with decreased odds of a positive test result (47 [11\u00b74%] of 413 active smokers vs 201 [17\u00b79%] of 1125 non-smokers; adjusted OR 0\u00b749, 95% CI 0\u00b734-0\u00b771).",

Use of primary care data could help identify risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection to inform patient management, public health measures, and more personalised advice to patient groups. 5 The Oxford Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) Research and Surveillance Centre programme is one of the longest established primary care sentinel networks globally. It includes more than 500 urban and non-urban participating general practices, covering a population of over 4 million people (appendix p 1). [6] [7] [8] The Oxford RCGP Research and Surveillance Network supports Public Health England in national surveillance of communicable diseases such as influenza 9 and assessing vaccine effectiveness, 10, 11 including during the 2009 influenza pandemic. 12 The network has adapted for COVID-19 surveillance by enlarging approximately three-fold to improve coverage and by introducing selfswabbing at home to reduce the risk of disease transmission. 13, 14 We aimed to identify demographic and clinical risk factors for testing posi tive for SARS-CoV-2 within this primary care surveil lance programme.",

These data allow estimation of household size, 15 deprivation level, and rural-urban classification. 16 Since the last week of January, 2020, Research and Surveillance Centre practices have submitted naso pharyngeal swabs to Public Health England for SARS-CoV-2 testing from patients presenting with symptoms of influenza or respiratory infections. We included tests done through Public Health England surveillance, contact tracing, and routine UK National Health Service (NHS) primary and secondary care services. Although Public Health England surveillance testing has continued largely unchanged throughout the study period, NHS testing initially focused on people who travelled to high-risk countries or close contact tracing, but it has more recently focused on hospital testing and testing of health-care workers.",

            "text": "Preliminary evidence has raised concerns regarding the potential increased risk of adverse COVID-19 outcomes among people of Asian and black ethnicities, but few epidemiological studies have assessed risk by ethnic group. 34 An analysis of 3370 people admitted to intensive care in the UK with confirmed COVID-19 found that 402 (11\u00b79%) were black, 486 (14\u00b74%) were Asian, and 2236 (66\u00b74%) were white, 35 compared with respective national figures of 3\u00b73%, 7\u00b75%, and 86\u00b70%. 36 These results did not adjust for potential socio demographic or clinical confounders. Overall numbers of black people, Asian people, and people from minority ethnic groups were small in our study, meaning our results should be interpreted with caution. However, we found that black people had higher odds of a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result than white people, which remained significant after adjusting for comorbidities such as hypertension and diabetes, the prevalence of which is increased in black ethnic groups. 37 Other socioeconomic factors that we did not measure, such as employment in high-risk positions, education, income, and structural barriers to health care, might have contributed to this association and should be urgently explored. Systematic reviews have shown that people with COVID-19 who have chronic comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease are at high risk of progressing to severe COVID-19 disease. 38 Risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection could be different, and we found no evidence of an association between these conditions and a positive SARS-CoV-2 test. We found that chronic kidney disease and obesity were associated with testing positive for SARS-CoV-2. Both chronic kidney disease and obesity have been associated with increased risk of other respiratory infections. [39] [40] [41] Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are recommended treatments for chronic kidney disease and have been postulated to impact SARS-CoV-2 host-cell interactions. 42 However observational evidence does not support this effect, 43-45 and further analyses to investigate the relationship between medications, chronic illnesses, and SARS-CoV-2 positivity.",

            "text": "Previous studies have reported that smoking is associated with increased risk of intensive care unit admission or death among people with COVID-19. 46 However, several studies reported a low prevalence of smoking among people with COVID-19. A Chinese study found that only 137 (12\u00b76%) of 1085 patients with COVID-19 were current smokers, compared with 27\u00b77% of Chinese adults, 47 and an analysis of cases by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found only 96 (1\u00b73%) of 7162 COVID-19 cases were active smokers, compared with 13\u00b77% in the general US population. 48 These studies could be biased by confounding and by difficulties in accurately identifying current smokers among patients unwell with COVID-19. We found that active smoking was associated with lower odds of having a positive test result. There are several plausible reasons for this result. Active smoking might affect naso pharyngeal viral load and therefore affect RT-PCR test sensitivity, rather than protecting against actual infection, although this effect is not known to occur with influenza RT-PCR testing. 49 Alternatively, as patients with symptoms are more likely to have been tested and included in our analysis, selection bias could affect this result. 50 Smokers are more likely to have a cough, meaning they might also be more likely to be tested for SARS-CoV-2 than non-smokers, even if they are SARS-CoV-2 negative. This more frequent testing could increase the propor tion of smokers with negative SARS-CoV-2 results in our sample, which would bias our results. However, the proportion of smokers in our study was low. Furthermore, ex-smokers and people with chronic lung disease would also be expected to cough more, but these groups did not have higher odds of SARS-CoV-2 test positivity. There fore, the relationship between smoking and SARS-CoV-2 infec tion merits further investigation. Nicotine might downregulate angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptors, 51 which are used by SARS-CoV-2 for cell entry, although studies have found increased angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 lung expression among smokers and people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. 52, 53 Our findings should not be used to conclude that smoking prevents SARS-CoV-2 infection, or to encourage ongoing smoking, particularly given the well documented harms to overall health from smoking, the potential for smoking to increase COVID-19 disease severity, 46 and the possible alternative explanations for these findings.",

However, the missing at random assumption is not testable. In certain situations when the missing at random assumption does not hold, we can rely on a complete-case analysis to provide unbiased estimates (eg, when the likelihood of being a complete case is independent of the outcome, conditional on the other covariates). 54 In this study, we presented both approaches, with similar results. We acknowledge that ethnicity, for example, might not be missing at random. However, our findings remained unchanged in a sensi tivity analysis that did not rely on the missing at random assumption, in which we imputed missing ethnicity based on ethnicity proportions in each participant's local geographical area. Although our study population of primary care patients is likely to be more similar to the general population than that of hospital-based studies, there remains a risk of selection bias because results might reflect the groups of patients who were more likely to present for assessment and be selected for SARS-CoV-2 testing in accordance with guidelines. If certain groups (eg, men, people in deprived areas, non-smokers, and black people) are only likely to present or be tested when more severely unwell, those who were tested could be more likely to be positive for COVID-19. Conversely, groups with lower thresholds for presen tation might be tested with less severe symptoms, and therefore be more likely to test negative. It was not possible to assess the effects of thresholds for presentation and changes in testing guidelines in this analysis. Population-based surveys should ensure consist ent levels of testing across subgroups as far as possible to reduce the risk of selection bias.",

Also, the sentinel network changed from in-practice nasopharyngeal swabbing to self-swabbing on March 14, 2020, which nonetheless has been found to be a reliable method when testing for influenza. 55 Further data are needed to establish the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2, particularly in relation to emerging factors such as ethnicity, deprivation, population density, and smoking. Population-based surveys could help reduce selection bias and ensure adequate inclusion of different population subgroups. Our data from primary care could help monitor incident infections and, therefore, the effect of public health mearues, and we plan analyses of rates of hospitalisation and death as the pandemic unfolds.",
