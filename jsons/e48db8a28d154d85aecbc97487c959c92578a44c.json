Lasswell's goal for the policy sciences to offer insights into unfolding phenomena, this commentary draws on the lessons of the policy sciences literature to understand the dynamics related to COVID-19. We explore the ways in which scientific and technical expertise, emotions, and narratives influence policy decisions and shape relationships among citizens, organizations, and governments. We discuss varied processes of adaptation and change, including learning, surges in policy responses, alterations in networks (locally and globally), implementing policies across transboundary issues, and assessing policy success and failure. We conclude by identifying understudied aspects of the policy sciences that deserve attention in the pandemic's aftermath.",

COVID-19 spread rapidly at a historic scale and with unprecedented impacts. Although milder symptoms include fever, aches, dry coughing, and shortness of breath, COVID-19 poses life-threatening conditions, ranging from respiratory failure to multiorgan disfunction. Older adults and those with pre-existing conditions (e.g., asthma) are at higher risk for the more severe impacts. However, everyone is susceptible, and anyone can contract and spread the disease.",

Lasswell (1956a) envisioned the policy sciences as providing insights into such situations, challenging and informing ongoing processes and decisions, and foretelling of future scenarios, all with the intent of steering government and society toward greater human dignity for all. Since the formulation of this vision over seven decades ago, the policy sciences have evolved into a vibrant field of scholarship, marked by conceptual richness, theoretical diversity, and methodological pluralism (Cairney and Weible 2017; Torgerson 2017) . This commentary capitalizes on the diversity and follows in the footsteps of Lasswell's vision by responding to the following question: What insights do the policy sciences offer to help us understand the pandemic ? We answer this question using ten policy perspectives that are featured in the policy sciences literature. These perspectives draw inspiration from Lasswell's (1956b) comprehensive portrayal of the functional elements that shape public policy. This requires going beyond analyzing any single aspect of public policy or a specific policy decision and understanding the dynamics of the processes, actors, and interactions that shape policy decisions in response to COVID-19. These include perspectives on policymaking (within country), crisis response and management, global policymaking and transnational administration, policy networks, implementation and administration, scientific and technical expertise, emotions, narratives and messaging, learning, and policy success and failure.",

Most countries have closed or restricted their borders and restricted travel within borders. One-third of the world's population has been subjected to some social restrictions (from school closures to stay-at-home orders). These policy decisions exist across levels of government. For example, some occur at the national level, such as the world's largest lock down targeting India's 1.3 billion people, or at the subnational or local level, such as California's state-law to prohibit evicting tenants of commercial property. 1 In examining this surge of policy change through the lens of the literature on policymaking, a few lessons emerge.",

            "text": "Governments adopt public policies through different pathways Supporting the literature on policy change (Weible and Sabatier 2017) , the pathways to policy change during COVID-19 include: (1) learning, as demonstrated in the UK's shift from mitigation (partial closures) to suppression (strict lock downs) following projection of the infection and death consequences of the former (Walker et al. 2020; Hunter 2020) ; (2) negotiated agreement, as illustrated by the passing of stimulus packages around the world, including the USA (Werner et al. 2020) , Canada (Bolongaro 2020) , and Japan (Kyodo 2020); and (3) diffusing and transferring ideas across governments, with many drawing lessons from South Korea's widespread testing and China's strict quarantining. Policy decisions are further conditioned by contextual factors, including institutional (e.g., constitutional and legalistic structures) factors, cultural orientations, economies, and political styles (among others). For example, Sweden's response to COVID-19 has thus far avoided many of the lockdowns of other countries, a response that has been partially attributed to a culture of trust and responsibility. Finally, prompting all of these changes is the shock of COVID-19 itself, which directly affects healthcare systems worldwide, but indirectly affects other policy areas, for example, by postponing welfare reforms, environmental policies, and other actions deemed \"non-essential\". 2 Uncertainties exist regarding the duration and termination of policy decisions While we are experiencing a surge of policy change aimed at reducing immediate societal threats, there remains great uncertainty regarding which of these changes will remain permanent and which will be terminated. This includes questions about how they will be terminated (phased or immediate) and the political consequences of reversing decisions that increased welfare benefits to cope with the immediate crisis.",

For the COVID-19 pandemic, one of the choices has been between mitigating versus suppressing COVID-19. Such choices impose different social and economic costs and benefits and raise important questions about how we value those costs and benefits. Given heightened public attention and policy impacts across society, most policy decisions (and non-decisions) are heavily scrutinized and politicized through framing contests and blame-games (Br\u00e4ndstr\u00f6m and Kuipers 2003) . Examples include debates around the Swedish strategy to ensure a slow spread of the virus (Henley 2020) and conflict in Brazil between state governors and the president over the best approach to tame the epidemic (Reuters 2020) . Other governments, such as New Zealand (Roy 2020), Ireland (Power et al. 2020) , and Iran (Karimi and Batrawy 2020), have been publicly criticized for doing too little too late. These experiences challenge the notion that policy conflicts can be temporarily suspended in times of crisis, with political opponents rallying around the proverbial flag until the worst is over. Indeed, there is a strong possibility that, while some policy conflicts will wane, others will wax as opportunities for political gain manifest and divisions emerge between those who support or oppose a government's response.",

While Johnson speaks about \"each of us\", he places this pronoun in the context of a \"huge national effort\", enabling him to urge \"the people of this country to rise to that challenge and\u2026to come through\u2026stronger than ever\u2026as many times in the past\". Through the reference to the past, he appeals to emotions of patriotism and national pride. The latter helps interpret one of Donald Trump's framings of the pandemic as\"foreign\" and its spread as \"cases entering our shores\" (Kessler and Rizzo 2020). 5 Trump strengthens this frame through the extensive use of military vocabulary, as when he described the virus is something to be \"defeated\". Iranian Prime minister Ali Khamenei uses a similar framing by claiming the virus \"comes from the US\" and could even be \"manipulated\" by them. This framing helps to legitimize the Iranian Government's limited ability to deal with the pandemic, as it links emotions of anxiety around COVID-19 to the anxiety around major geopolitical conflict. 6 Policy responses force a reevaluation of the emotional spheres in societies Policy responses to the pandemic have rippled through societies, including into the homes and lives of citizens. National lockdowns, for example, have elevated the necessity of homeschooling, self-care in response to long isolation, and a need for psychological consultation online services, such as those responding to the rise of home violence. 7 These are examples of how policy responses to the pandemic have entered the emotional spheres of the global citizenry and pose novel challenges to short-and long-term government efforts (Jupp et al. 2016; Durnov\u00e1 and Hejzlarov\u00e1 2018) .",

Instrumental learning around COVID-19, for instance, has occurred regarding how long the virus can linger on surfaces, leading to closures of many public and private buildings. Influencing our value orientations, the COVID-19 crisis has brought attention to underlying social dilemmas that make people either more vulnerable to the virus, or vulnerable to the efforts to stop it. We also see evidence of learning about the strength and vulnerabilities of the institutional rules structuring our governments and their efforts to tame the pandemic. Sweden, for example, passed a new bill to empower the national government to close temporarily schools in the nation, which was previously a municipality-level responsibility. 8 Different barriers inhibit learning In the case of the COVID-19 pandemic, learning is potentially constrained by several issues: the immediacy and urgency of the crisis, popular demands for forceful action, limitations in technical knowledge, and politicization (Stern 1997) . This raises questions as to whether we are learning the right things and whether the right people are learning. Many of our policy choices reflect a \"muscle memory\" from the past to guide us through the crisis until we can pause and reflect, allowing for deeper forms of learning. With COVID-19, we have some experiences to draw on, as illustrated in the USA ensuring oversight in the relief bill, building in part from perceptions of what the 2008 stimulus package lacked (Woodruff 2020) . However, the novelty of COVID-19 may also prevent learning opportunities from the past to guide us (Br\u00e4ndstr\u00f6m et al. 2004 ). At the same time, in the face of a crisis we may be even more inclined to look to those who are most like us, politically and ideologically, for lessons. For instance, across subnational governments in the USA we have seen differing approaches to lockdown policies that correspond closely with political ideologies (Adolph et al. 2020 ).",

Because many such policies are voluntary, levers for encouraging compliance with them oblige public servants to find ways to activate residents' civic sense of duty to comply and social pressures.

If we feel the overriding priority for providing financial aid to the unemployed and low-waged, then we are unlikely to view bailouts for airlines as success. Adapting Bovens and 't Hart (1998) useful approach to COVID-19 is the assessment of the extent of success/failure, its causes (from mismanagement to inevitability) and implications for future crisis decisions (from refining existing directions to the need for dramatic change). This can be applied to the \"whole of government\" response or simply to one aspect of the responses. Multiple narratives and variations are possible, but we outline three hypothetical illustrations: \u2022 First is the success trajectory e.g., a reduction in the number of daily cases is the product of the early banning of international flights from China. Our successes were and will continue to be the result of pre-emptive action. \u2022 Second is the failure trajectory e.g., the current exponential rise in confirmed cases is the product of complacent political leadership, more interested in calming fears for the next election than in addressing very real threats. New thinking is needed to avert more unnecessary tests. \u2022 Third is the mixed trajectory e.g., the government has succeeded in slowing down the rate of new infections but hospitals still cannot cope. We cannot afford to be complacent and must channel additional funds into front-line healthcare. Lasswell (1956a) envisioned the policy sciences to be both relevant and timely. In this spirit, this commentary draws immediate reflections based on different perspectives of the policy sciences to understand the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic poses unprecedented challenges in its immediate need for action, global span, and magnitude of impacts. We write this at a time when the pandemic has not yet reached its peak; hence, we draw on early observations in a concerted effort to offer insights into the ways in which scientific and technical expertise, emotions, and narratives and messaging legitimize policy decisions and shape relationships among citizens, organizations, and governments. We demonstrate the varied processes of adaptation and change, including learning, surges in policy responses, shifts in networks locally and globally, implementing and administering policies in response to transboundary issues, and assessing policy success and failure. There are also understudied aspects of the policy sciences that deserve more attention in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic. These include (but are not limited to) the following avenues of research:",
