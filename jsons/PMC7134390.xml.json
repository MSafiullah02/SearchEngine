Pregnant women with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection who are asymptomatic should be self-monitored at home for clinical features of COVID-19 for at least 14 days. These patients and those recovering from mild illness should be monitored with bimonthly fetal growth ultrasounds and Doppler assessments because of the potential risk for intrauterine growth restriction. Pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia should be managed by a multidisciplinary team at a tertiary care centre. When quick Sepsis-related Organ Failure Assessment criteria are met, the patient should be transferred to an intensive care unit.",
