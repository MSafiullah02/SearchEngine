This intermediate acts as a subgenomic promoter for transcription of the structural region mRNA (Jameel, 1999, Nanda et al., 1994). In addition, the nucleotide sequence in RdRp (4254\u20134560nt) is the most conserved genomic region in 37 HEV strains in four genotypes (Zhai et al., 2006). Therefore, the RdRp gene is expected to be a prime potential target for the development of an antiviral strategy.",

            "text": "Vaccines were previously considered as the best strategy for prevention of HEV infection, because all four HEV genotypes (1\u20134) have a single serotype (Mushahwar, 2008, Panda et al., 2007). However, earlier evidence has documented that, despite the presence of antibodies to HEV capsid protein, HEV is still capable of causing infection (Panda et al., 1995, Yarbough, 1999). Moreover, although vaccine-induced antibody might attenuate HEV infection, it may not prevent virus excretion in the feces (Panda et al., 1995). The reasons are that the protective neutralizing antibodies either do not develop or are only short-lived (Jameel, 1999, Yarbough, 1999). Recently, a purified polypeptide vaccine has been produced in insect cells infected with a recombinant baculovirus containing a truncated HEV genomic sequence encoding the capsid antigen, and has completed a phase 3 trial (Abreu, 2007, Krawczynski, 2007, Mushahwar, 2008, Shrestha et al., 2007). However, the safety and efficacy of this vaccine is doubtful (Tacke and Trautwein, 2007). First of all, the subjects were exclusively male, and it is pregnant women infected with HEV who have the highest mortality; secondly, the inconsistent data in humans and in rhesus monkeys (Krawczynski, 2007, Tacke and Trautwein, 2007) and finally, pigs can still suffer from HEV within 4\u20137 days post-infection, can transmit the virus as early as the first week post-infection and can continue to do so for at least several weeks (Halbur et al., 2001). However, the current vaccines cannot provide complete protection prior to 6 months (Shrestha et al., 2007). Thus, it is urgent to develop a more effective and safer therapeutic strategy for HEV control.",

It can inhibit the expression of crucial viral proteins by directly targeting viral mRNA for degradation (Gitlin et al., 2002, Shabalina and Koonin, 2008). It has been widely used to suppress viral replication by post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression, and has been successfully applied in infection inhibition studies of some viruses, such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (Kumar et al., 2008, Ludwig, 2008, Saayman et al., 2008, ter Brake et al., 2009), hepatitis C virus (HCV) (DeMarini et al., 2003, Lupberger et al., 2008) as well as severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-Cov) (Lu et al., 2004, Ni et al., 2005). In the present study, RNAi as a potential antiviral therapeutic strategy targeting the RdRp gene was used to inhibit HEV replication in vitro in A549 cells and in vivo in piglets.",

Because of this, RdRp may prove to be the best target and best timed strategy for suppression of HEV replication by RNA interference. As an antiviral therapy tool, RNA interference has great promise (Kumar et al., 2008, Lupberger et al., 2008, Ni et al., 2005) and represents a realistic approach for suppressing recalcitrant viral infections such as those induced by HEV.",
