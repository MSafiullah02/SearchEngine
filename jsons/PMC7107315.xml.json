He has been living in Chengdu, Sichuan province, for a long time. However, his mother had traveled to Wuhan a week ago and was diagnosed with the new coronavirus after she got back home. He has referred to the emergency department of our institution on 2 February 2020. General physical examination showed that moist rales were audible over both lungs, and the body temperature was 36.7\u00b0C, and other results were unremarkable. The laboratory tests showed that white blood cell count kept in the normal range (5.11 \u00d7 109/l), and the differential count showed decreased lymphocyte (16.8%, normal range 20\u201350%) and increased C-reactive protein (22.50 mg/l; normal range <5 mg/l). Chest computed tomography (CT) (2 February 2020) showed that there were ground-glass opacities, consolidation or both in bilateral lungs (Figure 1A). Considering the contact history with his mother and the CT features, a real-time fluorescence polymerase chain reaction of the patient\u2019s throat swab was performed, and the patient was confirmed with 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection.",

According to repeated CT scans, the patient\u2019s condition seemed to get improvement but somehow deteriorated suddenly. It is suggested that the condition of patients infected by 2019-nCoV can be waved and lingering. Under the circumstances, CT imaging is not only useful for the detection, location of lesions but also helpful in the evaluation of the dynamic changes of patients with 2019-nCoV. In summary, CT imaging can play a determinant role in clinical decision-making.",
