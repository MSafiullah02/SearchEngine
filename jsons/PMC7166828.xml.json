This secretory product appears to be involved in synchronizing circadian and seasonal timing of several physiological and behavioral processes [1, 2, 3, 4].

Several immune functions appear to be modulated by melatonin, including the antitumor defenses of the host [12] and cytotoxicity of natural killer cells [13]. The immune effects induced by melatonin seem to be mediated, at least in part, by endogenous opioid peptides [14]. Exogenous administration of melatonin enhances antibody production [14].",

When evaluated 6 days after virus inoculation (10 LD50 per mouse) the mortality rates of mice treated with 250, 500, and 1000 \u03bcg melatonin per kilogram were 45, 40, and 16%, respectively, as compared with 100% in control\u2010infected mice. In addition, melatonin treatment delayed the onset of the disease and prolonged the time to death in the treated mice. In surviving mice receiving the indoleamine, the VEE virus IgM antibody titers were highly elevated 7 wk after virus inoculation [44]. The administration of melatonin significantly decreased the virus levels in blood and brain as compared with the infected control mice. When mice were pretreated with melatonin for 10 days, a significant increase in the survival rate (73%) was observed when compared with the 60% obtained after the standard 3 days of pretreatment. In cultures of chicken embryo fibroblasts with serial dilutions of VEE virus, melatonin significantly reduced the degree of cell destruction. This finding contrasts with that reported by Ben\u2010Nathan et al. [41] who found no effect of the indoleamine on SFV growth in tissue culture. However, our results do not preclude the possibility that melatonin alters the host resistance to the virus, rather than viral replication, via a peripheral immunostimulatory effect, as fibroblasts are capable of producing tumor necrosis factor\u2010alpha (TNF\u2010\u03b1) whose antiviral activity is known [45]. Melatonin did not stimulate the synthesis of interleukin\u20102 (IL\u20102) but increased the serum concentration of interferon\u2010\u03b3 (IFN\u2010\u03b3). In infected mice, treated or non\u2010treated with melatonin, IFN\u2010\u03b3 levels in serum were also augmented. A direct and/or an immune\u2010based effect of melatonin on VEE viral replication within the brain was suggested by the fact that on day 5 after inoculation, the virus was not detected in the brain [44].",

This protection is approximately 50% of that provided to immunocompetent mice suggesting that this indoleamine requires, at least partially, the integrity of the immune system to induce its protective activity. The lack of effect of melatonin on the viral titers in the brain of immunodepressed mice contrasts with the finding that melatonin administration reduces VEE virus levels in the brain of immunocompetent mice [44] suggesting that the antiviral mechanisms stimulated by melatonin in immunocompetent mice are absent or diminished in the immunodepressed animals. The protection provided by melatonin against oxidative damage to cell components [6] could be responsible, at least in part, for the increase in the survival rate of the immunodepressed infected mice. In this regard, it was demonstrated that mice with targeted deletions in either their interferon\u2010alpha\u2010beta\u2010receptor (IFNAR\u20101\u2010/\u2010) or interferon regulatory factor 2 (IRF\u20102\u2010/\u2010) genes were more susceptible than control mice to VEE infection. The IFNAR\u20101\u2010/\u2010 mice exhibited accelerated VEE virus dissemination to serum and brain when compared with control mice. In IRF\u20102\u2010/\u2010 mice inducible nitric oxide synthetase (iNOS) gene, induction was completely absent following VEE virus infection. When the role of cells involved in iNOS production was evaluated, it was found that primary microglial cell cultures were highly sensitive to VEE virus infection. Besides, this infection increased the levels of nitric oxide in resting microglial cultures, but decreased nitric oxide production in IFN\u2010\u03b3\u2010stimulated microglia. These findings suggest that reactive nitrogen species play an important role in the spread of the VEE virus [47]. It is interesting to note that melatonin inhibits cerebellar NOS activity [48] and is a potent scavenger of nitric oxide in vitro [49]. In cultured murine macrophages, melatonin has been found to inhibit nitric oxide production due to a reduction in iNOS steady\u2010state mRNA levels and iNOS protein expression [50].",

It has been suggested that melatonin and IFN\u2010\u03b3 create an immunoregulatory circuit responsible for the antiviral, antiproliferative, and immunomodulatory action of IFN\u2010\u03b3 [52]. This cytokine increases serotonin and melatonin levels in lymphocytes and macrophages [53]. The early stimulation in the production of IFN\u2010\u03b3 by melatonin shown by Valero et al. [51] suggests that previous treatment with this indoleamine increases the antiviral activity of IFN\u2010\u03b3, that could possibly control viral replication at the moment of the VEE virus inoculation.",

Melatonin triggered the host IL\u20101\u03b2 response, suggesting an important role in the primary defense against the VEE virus infection [51]. These results are in agreement with the demonstration that this indoleamine activates monocytes and induces their cytotoxic properties, along with the IL\u20101\u03b2 secretion [55]. The monocytes/macrophages are not only sensitive to an external stimulation by melatonin, but they also synthesize it [52]; therefore, this agent increases the reactivity of monocytes against infections.",

The fact that 100% of the infected mice treated with melatonin died when IL\u20101\u03b2 was blocked with antimurine IL\u20101\u03b2 antibodies, suggests that IL\u20101\u03b2 induced by melatonin treatment is a target cytokine to promote the immune\u2010enhanced state which produces the viral clearance, or help generate an earlier immune response against the VEE virus infection. The study of mice lacking functional genes for IL\u20101\u03b2 or treatment of VEE\u2010infected mice with IL\u20101\u03b2 should provide further insight into its role in this infection.",

Elevations of IL\u2010\u03b2 levels in the brain have been detected in several viral infections of the CNS, such as those produced by the human immunodeficiency virus [58], simian immunodeficiency virus [59], SFV [60], rabies virus [61], and Sindbis virus [62]. However, these studies did not directly examine whether IL\u20101\u03b2 plays a protective or deleterious role in CNS viral infections. Liang et al. [63] compared the natural histories of deficient and wild\u2010type 129 SV (ev) mice infected with a neurovirulent viral strain, neuroadapted Sindbis virus. Their results suggest that IL\u20101\u03b2 deficiency is protective against fatal Sindbis virus infection. In contrast, mice deficient in IL\u20101\u03b2 have increased susceptibility to influenza virus [64], and in poxvirus animal models the viral induction of this cytokine is also beneficial for the host [65].",

The mechanism of this effect is unknown, but it is possible to envision that during the VEE viral infection certain degenerating neurons that contain substance P might release this neuropeptide, which subsequently induces the release of IL\u20101\u03b2 and TNF\u2010\u03b1 from monocytes [66], which can then infiltrate the CNS from the blood [67]. Microglia proliferate and phagocytose local neuronal debris, resulting in microglial synthesis of IL\u20101\u03b2 [67, 68], which in turn induces the expression of adhesion molecules on local endothelium, favoring transmigration of lymphocytes and monocytes [69]. The increase in IL\u20101\u03b2 levels produced by melatonin would provide neuronal support and protection by inducing nerve growth factor secretion by astrocytes [70], thereby supplying a trophic factor for many neuronal cell types in times of stress, such as that produced by the VEE virus infection.",

Astrocyte\u2010derived TNF\u2010\u03b1 can induce intercellular adhesion molecules on neighboring endothelial cells [80], alter blood\u2010brain barrier permeability, and promote inflammatory infiltration into the CNS [81]. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the highly significant decrease in the concentration of brain TNF\u2010\u03b1 produced by melatonin in mice infected with the VEE virus [57] is aimed at diminishing the inflammatory response in the CNS and at correcting the alteration in blood\u2010brain barrier permeability.

When treated with multiple doses of melatonin (5 mg/kg) the antibody titers rose significantly after the first week of immunization [86]. It is known that IL\u201010 induces activated B cells to secrete large amounts of IgA, IgG, and IgM antibodies [87]. The increase in IL\u201010 serum levels detected in mice vaccinated with TC\u201083 and treated with 1 and 5 mg/kg of melatonin, coincided with the rise in antibody titers displayed by these groups of mice at weeks 1 and 2 postimmunization. However, the virus levels in the brains of mice challenged with live VEE virus at day 21 postimmunization were significantly reduced. These results suggest that melatonin treatment enhanced the efficiency of mice immunization against VEE virus [86].",

This interleukin has been considered one of the earliest host mediators during infectious diseases of the CNS [88]. In these studies, the immunomodulatory properties of melatonin are evident and suggest this indoleamine as a therapeutic alternative to resist VEE and other viral diseases, including SARS as no antimicrobial agent has been proven to be effective for its treatment. The use of melatonin to treat SARS has been suggested by Shiu et al. [89].",
