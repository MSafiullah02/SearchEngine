The objective was to determine if the use of injectable trace minerals (ITM; Se, Zn, Cu, and Mn) concurrent with a modified-live virus (MLV) vaccine enhances the immune response and onset of protection in beef calves challenged with BVDV2 five days after vaccination. Forty-five calves were randomly assigned to one of three groups (15/group): VAC+ITM, received MLV-vaccine and ITM (Multimin \u00ae 90) subcutaneously (SC); VAC+SAL, received the same vaccine and saline SC; or UNVAC, unvaccinated. Five days after vaccination (d.0), calves were challenged with BVDV2 strain 890. Health status was evaluated and blood samples were collected for leukocyte counts, BVDV1 and 2 serum neutralizing antibody (SNA), BVDV-PCR, percentage of CD4 + , CD8 + , WC1 + and CD25 + T-cells. VAC+ITM had lower health scores than UNVAC (d.8 and 9).",

Lymphocyte counts decreased in UNVAC but not in VAC+ITM or VAC+SAL (d.3 to 11). CD4 + T-cells significantly decreased in UNVAC and VAC+SAL (d.3). VAC+ITM had higher percentage of CD4 + cells than UNVAC (d .3 and 7) . VAC+ITM had lower percentage of activated CD4 + and CD8 + than UNVAC (d.7). In summary, vaccination induced a rapid protection against BVDV2 infection. Administration of ITM was associated with increased SNA response to BVDV1 & 2, enhanced health status, mitigation of CD4 + T-cells decreased, and reduction of T-cell activation in calves challenged with BVDV2 five days after immunization. These results support the strategic use of ITM concurrent with vaccination, especially when a rapid protection is needed in newly received beef calves.",

Despite the commercial availability of several highly efficacious vaccines in the USA, a significant number of producers do not vaccinate their calves against BVDV or other BRD pathogens. The efficacy of vaccination to prevent BVDV infection can be assessed by the vaccine's capacity to induce robust humoral and cell-mediated immune responses able to control virus replication, viremia and shedding (Rhodes et al. 1999; Reber et al., 2006) . Another crucial aspect when assessing the efficacy of BRD vaccines is the rapidity in inducing an adequate immune response to protect cattle against acute infections and disease (Palomares et al., 2012) . This trait is especially important in stockyards and feedlots, where continuous addition of highly stressed cattle with unknown vaccination history and infectious status rises the risk of infections and clinical disease resulting in high morbidity and mortality rates and significant economic losses.",

            "text": "The impact of these minerals on the immune function has been associated with their role in the structure and function of antioxidant enzymes (e.g. superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase), nucleic acid replication and transcription, mitochondrial metabolic cascades, among others (Tomlinson et al., 2008; Haase and Rink, 2014) ; resulting in improvement of neutrophil migration and phagocytic function, lymphocyte proliferation and antibody production (Pina et al., 2002; Tomlinson et al., 2008; Arthington and Havenga, 2012; Haase and Rink, 2014; Bonaventura et al., 2015) . The use of trace mineral supplementation may become particularly important in highly stressed cattle, such as newly received feeder calves (Duff and Galyean, 2007) . Administration of injectable trace minerals (ITM) has shown beneficial effects on antibody production and cell mediated immune response to BRD vaccines in beef (Arthington and Havenga, 2012; Roberts et al., 2016) and dairy cattle (Palomares et al., 2016; Bittar et al., 2018a) . A recent study developed by our group demonstrated that the use of ITM concomitant with an MLV-BRD vaccine in dairy calves resulted in earlier and greater serum neutralizing antibody titers to BVDV1 and Mannheimia haemolytica, and more rapid and stronger mononuclear cell proliferation upon stimulation with BVDV1, BRSV and Pasteurella multocida than the control calves (Palomares et al., 2016; Bittar et al., 2018a) . After this study, there was a question as to whether the use of ITM could also favor J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f the induction of a more rapid and improved immune response and protection shortly after vaccination in situations where a fast protection is required, such as that of newly received calves vaccinated at arrival and shortly exposed to BRD pathogens. Therefore, in the present study we hypothesized that administration of ITM at the time of MLV-BRD vaccination would benefit the immune response and protection in newly received BVDV-na\u00efve beef calves experimentally challenged with BVDV five days after vaccination. The objective of this study was to determine if the use of injectable trace minerals (containing Se, Zn, Cu, and Mn) supplementation concurrent with a modified-live virus (MLV) vaccine is able to enhance the immune response and onset of protection against an experimental BVDV2 infection in newly received BVDV-na\u00efve beef calves challenged 5 days after vaccination.",

The cells were suspended to a concentration of approximately 6x10 6 cells per mL. The samples all had 85% viability or greater. Each sample was diluted in 3 mL PBS-1X in individual pre-labeled tubes (12x75 mm polystyrene. Falcon, BD Biosciences, San Jos\u00e9, CA). The cells were washed twice by centrifugation (300 x g for 5 minutes). The supernatant was discarded after each wash. The cells were suspended in 1.5 mL of FACS buffer (PBS with 0.5% bovine serum albumin, and 0.1% sodium azide) and mixed uniformly by vortexing. For staining, 100 \u00b5L of cells suspension (approximately 3x10 6 cells) were added per well to a 96-well round bottom microtiter plate. Plates were centrifuged (300 x g for 5 minutes) and snapped sharply to remove the supernatant. Each plate was vortexed with lid on to suspend the cells in the residual volume. At this point, 20 \u00b5L of each antibody tested (at the minimum saturating concentration) J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f was added to the desired wells, and wells that were dual stained (combination of CD25 with either CD4, CD8 or WC1). The primary antibodies were mouse anti-bovine CD4 isotype IgG2a antibody at a 1:5 dilution (clone CC8, MCA1653F, BioRad, Hercules, CA), mouse anti-bovine CD8 isotype IgG2a antibody at a 1:5 dilution (clone CC63, MCA837F, BioRad, Hercules, CA), mouse antibovine WC1 (gamma-delta T cell) isotype IgG2a antibody at a 1:5 dilution (clone CC15, MCA838F, BioRad, Hercules, CA), and mouse anti-bovine CD25 isotype IgG1 antibody at a 1:7 dilution (clone IL-A111, MCA2430PE). FACS buffer was added to wells to function as an unstained control. A combination of CD25 and each of the other T-cell (CD4, CD8 and WC1) antibodies were used to stain the cells. Plates were incubated (4 o C for 45 minutes). Following staining, the plates were washed three times with FACS buffer (300 x g for 5 minutes). At the end of each wash, the plates were snapped sharply to remove the supernatant. Each plate was vortexed with lid on to suspend the cells in the residual volume. After the last wash, the supernatant was discarded and the cells were suspended in FACS fix (4% formalin in FACS buffer). Each well received 100 \u00b5L of FACS fix. The plates were incubated overnight (18-20 hours) at 4 o C. Well contents were transferred into a pre-labeled 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes (MCT) containing 300 \u00b5L of FACS buffer. After dilution of FACS buffer, samples were stored for flow cytometry analysis at 4\u00baC. All samples were assessed within one week of fixation. Flow cytometry was done using a BD Accuri C6 first generation cytometer and C-flow plus software (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ). Samples were gated using FALS and 90LS two parameter histograms to identify the lymphocyte, monocyte and granulocyte cells in the sample based on previous validation with highly enriched populations of each. Compensation to minimize cross talk between FL1 and FL2 signal was established using single color samples at minimum saturating concentration to eliminate green in orange and orange in green color bleed. The positive and J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f negative windows for FL1 and FL2 single color analysis, and FL1-FL2 dual parameter histograms were established in preliminary trials using staphylococcal enterotoxin B stimulated buffy coat cells under the same staining conditions and set in a template for flow collection. Approximately 10,000 events were recorded in the lymphocyte gate for each sample. Following data collection, the lymphocyte gate was confirmed using the list mode data for each sample to assure that the same population was measured for each sample across the total experiment. The C-flow plus software was used to generate values for percent positive cells for each marker, and for CD25 positive cells within each marker. In addition, values for the mean fluorescent intensity were generated from the analysis gates for each marker and for the CD25 population within each marker for all samples in the trial.",

Vaccinated calves (treated with ITM or not) had a slight decline in the percentage of CD8 + T cells after BVDV2 challenge, which rebounded to initial values by day 7 post BVDV challenge.

Moreover, administration of ITM resulted in increased hepatic concentrations of Se and Cu, and provided additional benefits of stronger immune response and protection after BVDV challenge (greater number of CD4 + T-cells, higher BVDV1 and 2 SNA titers, and lesser health scores) compared with the other groups. Hepatic Zn concentration was significantly higher in the unvaccinated group compared with the vaccinated calves. The reasons for this difference are unknown, but could be associated with higher level of stress (caused by BVDV infection) in the control calves, as previously reported(Nockels et al., 1993).The experimental approach of performing vaccination and then virus challenge a few days after arrival was used to evaluate the onset of protection by attempting to mimic a common scenario of BVDV exposure upon arrival and commingling with cattle of unknown vaccination history. A rapid onset of protection induced by primary vaccination in susceptible calves with unknown immune status would be highly beneficial to beef cattle production, where high BRDrisk calves are subjected to management practices that involve significant stress including sudden weaning, transportation, comingling, and abrupt changes in diets. Previous studies evaluated the rapidity of the development of protection induced by MLV vaccination in beef calves challenged",

The degree of leukopenia and thrombocytopenia is correlated to virulence of some specific strains of BVDV (Walz et al., 2001). Leukopenia induced by BVDV has been associated with apoptosis and necrosis of leukocytes, as well as leukocyte migration from circulation into tissues where viral replication occurs (Walz et al., 2010). BVDV-induced leukopenia results in immunosuppression and plays a major role in the pathogenesis of BRD, as it potentiates secondary infection by commensal flora in the upper respiratory tract responsible for",

            "text": "immune system to prevent viral infections such as BVDV. Neutralizing antibodies hamper BVDV replication and transmission in the host cells, diminishing the chances of a successful viral infection and shedding within cattle populations. Similarly, positive effects of using ITM concurrent with MLV vaccination on improvement of SNA production against BRD viruses and animal health and performance have been shown in previous studies in dairy and beef cattle(Richeson and Kegley, 2011;Arthington and Havenga, 2012; Palomares et al., 2016). In contrast, J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f our previous study evaluating the effects of ITM given at the time of vaccination on the long-term protection against BVDV infection in dairy calves showed no improvement in BVDV SNA titers or protection from clinical disease in calves treated with ITM(Bittar et al., 2018b). The absence of clinically remarkable differences between groups was attributed to the moderate virulence BVDV strain used for challenge, low level of stress and limited infectious pressure, which favored protection elicited by two doses of MLV vaccination. On the other hand, the greater BRD risk scenario of the current trial (one dose of MLV vaccine given to na\u00efve cattle, short interval between vaccination and BVDV challenge, 8-hour transportation before vaccination and the diet change) might explain discordance between these studies. Thus, the experimental conditions of the current study appear to optimize the effects of ITM concurrently with MLV BRD vaccine, especially when a rapid onset of an immune response and early protection are needed.Infection with BVDV caused a significant reduction in number of CD4 + and CD8 + T lymphocytes in the unvaccinated calves, which agrees with previous reports(Howard et al., 1992;Chase et al., 2004). Calves treated with ITM had a less pronounced reduction in CD4 + T-cells(with higher percentage on days 3 and 7) and a lower number of activated CD4 + CD25 + and CD8 + CD25 + T-cells compared to the other groups. Lymphocytes expressing the surface protein CD4 (T helper cells), play an important role in the humoral and cell mediated immune response after vaccination and/or infection. They contribute to the activity of other immune cells by releasing cytokines that help stimulating or regulating the immune response (Abbas et al., 2012). They are essential in B cell antibody isotype switching, activation and proliferation of cytotoxic T-cells (CD8 + ), and in maximizing phagocytic and bactericidal activity by neutrophils and macrophages, among other functions. Cytotoxic T lymphocytes or CD8 + T-cells have important effector functions killing virus-infected cells, through the release of the J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f cytotoxins perforins, granzymes, and granulysin(Abbas et al., 2012). It is known that CD4 + T-cell depletion during BVDV acute infection may increase the period of virus shedding, as demonstrated by the higher proportion of unvaccinated calves carrying BVDV in nasal secretions and peripheral blood leukocytes in this trial and previous studies(Howard et al., 1992). Total and activated WC1 + T-cells were consistently increased in the unvaccinated group after BVDV2 challenge. Treatment with ITM appeared to prevent a significant increase in WC1 + T-cells. In cattle, gamma delta Tcells expressing the WC1 phenotype accounts for up to 60 % of the total circulating lymphocytes and have been described to have regulatory functions with spontaneous IL-10 secretion,(Hoek et   al., 2009;Guzman et al., 2014). Therefore, increasing activation and trafficking of gamma delta T lymphocytes may be one of the mechanisms used by BVDV to down-regulate the immune system causing immune suppression, as it has been previously reported(Palomares et al., 2015).It is possible to infer that ITM supplementation positively influenced both humoral and cell mediated immune responses elicited by MLV primary vaccination, as previously shown(Palomares et al., 2016;Bittar et al., 2018a), resulting in an enhanced protection upon BVDV exposure. In addition, ITM may have contributed to a more efficacious innate immunity (e.g. type 1 interferon antiviral state, antigen processing and presentation) after vaccination, which may have limited BVDV replication and viral load at the site of infection, reduced virus-induced T-cell depletion (resulting in higher number of CD4 + T-cells) and lowered the proportion of T-cells trafficking to secondary lymphoid tissues after virus infection, reducing T-cell activation, proliferation and differentiation. This inference might explain the lower percentage of activated CD4 + CD25 + and CD8 + CD25 + in the peripheral blood circulation in the VAC+ITM group.This study had the limitations that T-cell populations were not evaluated at the tissue level (respiratory tract mucosa and lymphoid tissue), which would have provided a better understanding J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f of the T-lymphocyte phenotypic dynamics after the BVDV challenge. Nonetheless, to the authors' knowledge, this is the first study evaluating the ex-vivo dynamics of circulating T-cells upon BVDV challenge occurring shortly after MLV-BRD vaccination.",
