Unfortunately, the sensitivity of many of the commercially available tests is suboptimal and the Health Protection Agency now recommends using a two-stage testing algorithm, which may incorporate a molecular test. Several of these are available, helping to improve the accuracy of diagnosis. As molecular tests detect the presence of a gene rather than gene expression, it is important to correlate test results with clinical findings to help differentiate colonization (which may be detected in around 20% of hospitalized patients) from infection).6, 7, 8\n",
