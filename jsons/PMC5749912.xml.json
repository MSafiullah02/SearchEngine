The testing platform for respiratory viruses other than influenza virus was determined by the participating laboratories but was required to be PCR based. Five sites used virus-specific RT-PCR assays developed and shared by the CDC [11]. In the remaining sites, one of the following 2 commercial multiplex RT-PCR platforms was used in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions: Luminex xTAG Respiratory Virus Panel (RVP; Luminex Diagnostics, Toronto, Canada) and ResPlex II v2.0 (Qiagen, Venlo, the Netherlands). One site tested specimens first by the Luminex xTAG RVP and then subtyped influenza A virus\u2013positive specimens by using the CDC panel.

The duration of the national influenza season encompasses the start of the earliest local site activity and the end of the latest local site activity; thus, the overall duration is longer than it is at a specific site. The national peak percentage positivity is similarly a composite of the percentage positivity in local sites at different phases of their outbreaks and thus will not be as high as the site-specific peak.

The ARI case definition did not require fever and consisted of more nonspecific symptoms, which has been shown to coincide with a lower pathogen recovery rate [17]. By extrapolating the proportion of outpatient visits associated with virus detection, we calculated that 55/1000 persons have a virus-associated ARI that is medically attended. When we further examined the incidence by our case definitions, we found that outpatient visits occurred more frequently for ARI than for ILI (59/1000 persons, compared with 37/1000 persons), but the rate of virus detection among patients with ILI was higher.

Influenza virus\u2013associated incidence estimates were highest among older children and young adults of day care and school age, likely because of higher susceptibility throughout adolescence in conjunction with a high potential for social mixing [2, 10, 18]. The observed RSV infection incidence was highest among children age <5 years, but RSV was detected throughout the age groups. Our findings are consistent with studies that have established RSV as significantly impacting the youngest ages and supports recent data demonstrating the risk for RSV infection among elderly persons [19, 20]. The incidence of PIV-3, ADV, and MPV visits was highest among children age 1\u20134 years, all of which have been established previously as impacting very young children [19, 21, 22]. While the incidence of PIVs was low, IISP data reflected a previously reported trend indicating a younger age range affected by PIV-3 than both PIV-1 and PIV-2 [23]. Finally, the rates of RV/EV detection were high among patients age <1 year (30/1000 persons), which is important for physician consideration since both rhinoviruses and enteroviruses have been associated with severe illness among neonates [6, 24, 25].",

            "text": "While both ILI and ARI occurred year-round, ILI had a more distinct seasonal pattern that corresponded with the increase in virus detections. Influenza virus detections occurred in large numbers during the winter months (Figure 2); in contrast, RV/EV detections were predominant during early fall months and occurred in low levels throughout the year, giving an inverse circulation pattern to that of influenza virus and a similarly high cumulative incidence. While the activity did not demonstrate a clear peak, the incidence of RV/EV coincided with the beginning of the school year; this pattern has been observed previously although inconsistently [26\u201328]. The observed winter peak activity of RSV has been well described [29]. We also observed peak MPV detections during late winter and early spring, consistent with other recent surveillance reports [30]. PIVs were detected throughout the year but with varying incidence and seasonality by type. According to several longitudinal surveillance programs, PIV-1 demonstrates a biennial seasonal pattern with increased incidence in uneven years [25, 31, 32], which may explain the low incidence of PIV-1 in 2010. The seasonality of PIV-2 and PIV-3 matched expected patterns [32]. The characteristic lack of ADV seasonality [9, 21] was observed in IISP but with a slight decrease in incidence during the summer months that has been described by Olofsson [30].",

The difficulty in defining catchment areas and thus the utility of using patient populations for outpatient incidence estimation, as well as the comparability of these estimates, have been demonstrated previously [10, 33]. Furthermore, the United Kingdom has long reported the weekly incidence of ILI similarly based on practitioners' registered patients [34]. Underscoring the unique nature of IISP data, there are currently no US-based alternative sources of data with which to directly compare. A study by Neuzil et al found a comparable incidence of outpatient ARIs that could be attributed to a respiratory virus of 43\u201367/1000 among adults aged \u226518 years [4]. Our incidence, as expected, was lower than estimates reported in much of the literature, due in part to the use among the most-comparable studies of broadly defined and less specific criteria for respiratory illness or to the lack of a laboratory-confirmed influenza outcome [35, 36]. Another possible reason IISP incidence estimates were lower was that our surveillance largely represented primary care providers, while community-based and health maintenance organization population-based estimates have included healthcare visits at all points of care, including emergency departments or urgent care clinics. Future analyses with healthcare utilization data will be conducted to determine the representative proportion of primary care providers in disease burden estimation.",

The surveillance design targeted traditional outpatient HCPs, which may have led to an underrepresentation of patients aged \u226565 years, because elderly patients are known to be underrepresented in surveillance owing to atypical clinical presentations assay insensitivity in this population [37]. As demonstrated by the proficiency testing, we found differential levels of sensitivity between the commercial multiplex assays and the CDC virus-specific RT-PCR assays, which may have resulted in underestimates among multiplex sites; however, proficiency testing suggested that lower sensitivity would most likely occur among patients with very low viral loads. Furthermore, patients, particularly adults, may not have had detectable virus at the time of the visit, because of a shorter duration of shedding, time from onset to specimen collection, noninfectious illnesses, or nonoptimally collected specimens. Finally, our test panel included only select viral pathogens; thus, specimens with negative results could have been associated with pathogens not included in our panel in all sites, such as the coronaviruses, which composed 7% of specimens in sites that did include them.",

Our data demonstrate the substantial burden of ARI and ILI, the contribution of specific viruses, and the usefulness of the ILI case definition for influenza virus surveillance. Linking syndromic and virologic surveillance allows public health agencies to determine the burden and distribution of viruses and circulation patterns among outpatients of different ages and specifically inform HCPs about circulating viruses in their geographic location, which could impact influenza antiviral and general antimicrobial use. Furthermore, year-round, systematic RSV detection data can inform appropriate initiation of palivizumab RSV prophylaxis, which is typically limited to only 5 monthly doses per year because of the high cost [38]. The IISP presents a platform for conducting population-based surveillance coupled with systematic testing for respiratory viruses, which can improve our ability to estimate the burden of disease, direct public health interventions, and inform antiviral therapy administration.",
