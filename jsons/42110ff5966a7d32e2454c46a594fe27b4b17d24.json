Considering the dynamics of airway epithelium, showing closure of cell defects within minutes after trauma (321, these findings do not exclude an increased turnover rate and shedding of epithelial cells during a RV cold.

It is possible that this study was undertaken during a period with an epidemic of influenza-, parainfluenza or adenovirus infection. This study of naturally acquired colds (\"wild colds\") needs confirmation with the use of modem diagnostic tests for establishing the virus etiology, because the results differ strikingly from the in vitro studles showing no or very little cytopathologic effect of RV and coronavirus on ciliated cells.

It remains to be established, therefore, whether a RV infection causes wheezing by a direct infection of the lower airways or by alternate mechanisms through which upper airway infections can cause changes in lower airway function. It is hypothesized that virus-induced generation of cytokines, mainly by epithelial cells, amplifies the T-cell-driven eosinophil inflammation in asthma, but it is unclear how the virus-induced inflammation, characterized by a Thi -type cytokine response, enhances inflammation in asthma, characterized by a Thz-type cytokine response. Furthermore, it is not in accordance with an important role played by cytokines in the production of cold symptoms that corticosteroids have no or little effect on the nasal symptoms of a cold. Clinical experience shows that corticosteroids have a beneficial effect on cold-induced asthma exacerbations, but placebo-controlled studies have not been performed. Finally, intervention studies are needed to show whether attempts of stopping virus transmission to asthma patients can reduce their number of colds and of asthma exacerbations. ",
