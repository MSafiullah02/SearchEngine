As a result, investigators began to pursue the mechanisms by which the fetus might escape such maternal immune surveillance. Furthermore, alterations in these pathways in pregnancy complications, such as recurrent abortion and preeclampsia, where the immune system is thought to play a central role, have been used as further evidence for the Medawar hypothesis. As a consequence, since Dr. Medawar's original observation, numerous studies have been performed in order to explain this paradigm, many of which have been centered on how the fetus and placenta fight against an active and aggressive maternal immune system. While varied hypotheses have been proposed in order to explain how the maternal immune system might be neutralized during normal pregnancy (see ref 2 for review of the different hypotheses); none, however, have been able to convincingly demonstrate that in normal pregnancy there exists an immunological attack on the fetus.",

In his original work, he described the \"fetal allograft analogy\" whereby the fetus may be viewed as a semiallogeneic conceptus that has evaded rejection by the maternal immune system.^ Subsequently, a number of mechanisms were proposed to account for this lack of fetal rejection. The different hypotheses can be summarized into five main concepts: (i) The mechanical barrier effect of the trophoblast; (ii) Systemic suppression of the maternal immune system during pregnancy; (iii) The absence of classical MHC class I molecules in the trophoblast; (iv) A cytokine shift; and more recently (v) Localized immune suppression. Unfortunately, none of them can adequately explain or prove the existence of the fetal allograft analogy.^ Indeed, we know today that the trophoblast does not provide a mechanical barrier, since there is evidence for the trafficking of cells in both directions across the maternal-fetal interface. This includes the migration of maternal cells into the fetus,^^ and the presence of fetal cells in the maternal circulation.^^'^^ Indeed, this is the case in almost all the immune privileged tissues, including the brains blood brain barrier. Conclusive evidence has shown that immune cells circulate through all the parts of the brain indicating that mechanical barriers do not deter the migration of leukocytes into supposedly immune privileged sites. ^' The hypothesis of systemic immune suppression has been challenged by recent studies clearly demonstrating that maternal anti-viral immunity is not affected by pregnancy. The clearest observation is that HIV^ pregnant women do not suffer from AIDS-like disease argues against the existence of such nonspecific immune suppression during pregnancy.^^ The expression of HLA-G, a monomorphic, trophoblast-specific HLA class I molecule was used to explain why trophoblast survives, despite the presence of abundant decidual NK cells. According to this hypothesis, the HLA-G molecule acted as a surrogate \"self\" class I molecule thus preventing NK cell killing. ^^'^ However, more recent studies by several groups have not supported this hypothesis.^ ^' \"^ The definition of pregnancy as a \"TH2 environment\" was originally enthusiastically embraced and numerous studies tried to prove and support this hypothesis. It is now becoming increasingly clear that theTHl/TH2 nomenclature is a hindrance beyond CD4'^ T cell functions; and while there are strong evidences that anti-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-10, are relevant for the success of pregnancy, it is also true that pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6 and IL-8, are produced during and necessary for normal pregnancy. Lastly, the idea that the trophoblast creates an immune privileged microenvironment by eliminating immune cells that pose a potential threat, specifically through the Fas/Fas ligand system,'^^''^^ has been challenged by the lack of an immune response or fetal rejection in mice lacking Fas {Ipr) or Fas ligand (gld)?^ Our recent studies indicate that Fas ligand (FasL) is not expressed at the cell surface membrane of trophoblast cells, but is instead secreted via microvesicles to act on Fas expressing cells at locations away from the implantation site.\"^^ The role of this functional secreted FasL is not fully understood and is under investigation. More recently, the role of IDO^^ and T regulatory cells (Trg)^^ have been proposed as potential mechanisms for the immunological escape of the fetus. Numerous groups are pursuing this hypothesis, and their results will determine whether this theory is valid.",

However, the placenta is more than just a transplanted organ. Our knowledge of placental biology has significantly increased over the last 50 years. We now know that the placenta is a complex organ, which has evolved from the original \"egg cover\". Pregnancy and implantation, contrary to \"graft implants\", has been taking place for more than 100,000 years. Therefore, from an evolutionary point of view it is difficult to conceive that the placenta and the maternal immune system still maintain an antagonistic status. Furthermore, as our understanding of role of the immune cells at the implantation site increases, we learn that many of these leukocytes are present for the protection and maintenance of the pregnancy, rather its rejection. Therefore, we propose that the trophoblast and the maternal immune system have evolved and established a cooperative status, helping each other against common enemies, such as infectious microorganisms. In the present review we will discuss some of the evidences suggesting that the immune system is critical for pregnancy success and that the trophoblast itself may function as a normal component of the innate immune system, so that together they can defend the maternal-fetal interface against invading pathogens and, as we will discuss, possibly take advantage of commensal microbes.",

Initial studies have reported mRNA expression ofTLR-l-TLR-10,^^aswell as protein expression of TLR-2 and TLR-4,*^^'^^ in term placenta. Since then we have observed that in first trimester placental tissues, functional TLR-2 and TLR-4 are highly expressed in the villous cytotrophoblast and extravillous trophoblast populations.^^ Interestingly, while third trimester trophoblast cells express TLR-2 and TLR-4, these receptors are not expressed by first trimester syncytiotrophoblast cells. ^ Together these findings have demonstrated that trophoblast cells expressing TLRs may respond to bacterial products. ' ^ How then can the trophoblast tolerate LPS from commensal gram-negative bacteria but also react to the same LPS from a pathogen? One potential explanation is the compartmentalization of TLR-4. This compartmentalization can be either intracellular localization or cell type specific. In the first case, we found that, contrary to the classical membrane expression of TLR-4 on many of innate immune cells, such as macrophages, trophoblast cells express TLR mainly in the cytoplasm; suggesting that these cells may recognize LPS associated with bacteria that have been internalized. We have also found that the expression of TLR is cell type specific, according to its tissue localization. In first trimester placentas, the syncythiotrophboast (the outer layer of the villi) is negative forTLR-2 anclTLR-4, while the internal layer, the cytotrophoblast, is positive for both receptors. ^ The lack of TLR expression by the outer trophoblast layer during the first trimester is analogous to studies of mucosal epithelial cells of the intestinal tract, which have been shown to express TLR-5 only on their basolateral side. ^ These cells will only respond to a bacterium that has invaded the basolateral compartment from the apical side. Since a pathogen is characterized as a microorganism that breaches certain physical barriers, these observations have helped to explain how an immune response can be mounted against pathogenic, but not commensal bacteria. Similarly, a microorganism will only be a threat to the fetus if theTLR-negative syncytiotrophobast cell layer is breached and the pathogen has entered either the decidual or the placental villous compartments. Therefore, the placenta may distinguish between pathogenic and commensal microorganisms during pregnancy. Once an infection has gained access to the TLR positive trophoblast cells, a response may be mounted. As described below, the type of pathogen and, therefore, the specific receptor activated may have a significant impact on the type of response generated by the cells of the placenta.",

Innate recognition of PAMPs through TLRs initiates an inflammatory response, characterized by the recruitment of immune cells to the site of infection in order to augment microbial killing and halt spread. Cell migration from the peripheral blood into inflamed tissues involves a tightly controlled sequence of events, which are mediated by the two type of signals; chemokines and cell surface adhesion molecules.

Instead of the maternal immune system responding to the invading trophoblast as foreign, it appears that the trophoblast, under normal conditions, is playing a central role in regulating leukocyte migration into the decidua, suggesting that the immune cells themselves are important for pregnancy. In vivo models suggest that the presence of NK cells within the endometrium is necessary for successful implantation '^^ and it has been postulated that NK cells play a role in the decidualization of the endometrium.^^ Similarly, macrophages at the implantation site and throughout gestation are thought to benefit pregnancy. Decidual macrophages may efficiently clear apoptotic cells, thus maintaining tissue homeostasis. Macrophages may also provide the trophoblast v^ith soluble factors that w^ill stimulate their grov^h and differentiation, as w^ell as promoting the invasion and transformation of the spiral arteries/^'^^'^^ As the trophoblast breaches the epithelial surface of the lumen during implantation, it may allows access of bacteria into the uterine stroma. While, acute inflammation is necessary for implantation, it is also critical to avoid chronic inflammatory responses that may be triggered by excessive bacterial invasion. To this purpose, w^e hypothesize that the trophoblast itself, promotes a local innate immune responses tov^ards microbes w^ithin the stroma, thereby increasing protection (Fig. 1) . Again using the in vitro migration system, upon ligation ofTLR-4 by bacterial LPS, chemokine production by trophoblast cells is significantly increased and this further enhances monocyte migration^^ (Fig. 2) . Furthermore, the chemokine response follovv^ing activation is differentially regulated depending upon the stimuli. When trophoblast cells are exposed to the TLR-3 agonist Poly(LC), a synthetic analog of viral dsRNA, a potent chemokine response is induced, yet this profile is distinct from that triggered through TLR-4.^^ These findings demonstrate that the trophoblast, just like an innate immune cell, can recognize and respond to microbes. As a result, the trophoblast can coordinate an immune response through the recruitment of innate immune cells to the site of infection.",

The expression of TLR-3 by trophoblast cells may explain how the placenta regulates the expression of these antimicrobial factors. Indeed, stimulation of first trimester trophoblast cells, through TLR-3 with Poly (I:C), promotes the production and secretion of SLPI and beta Interferon (IFN-P), two important anti-viral factors.^^ These factors are the first line of defense against viral infections and have the potential to activate multiple intracellular pathways.^^ Therefore, IFN-P and SLPI production by trophoblast cells in response to a viral infection at the maternal-fetal interface may represent a potential mechanism by which the placenta prevents HIV transmission to the fetus during pregnancy.

While innate immune cells may be important during normal pregnancy for resolving infections at the maternal-fetal interface, these same leukocytes may contribute to the pathology of certain pregnancy complications (Fig. 1) . In abnormal pregnancies, such as prematurity or preeclampsia, decidual tissues contain elevated levels of macrophages, neutrophils and NK cells and such leukocyte distributions are altered.^ Similarly, in animal models of preterm labor and pregnancy failure, where the delivery of microbial products are used to initiate disease, the decidua becomes infiltrated with these same innate immune cells.^^'^ Such altered immune responses at the maternal-fetal interface may significantly impact the pregnancy.",

In contrast, high levels of LPS acting through TLR-4, triggers first trimester trophoblast cells to produce pro-inflammatory cytokines, including TNFa and IFNy, which in turn may induce trophoblast cell apoptosis. ^^^'^^ Therefore, while LPS does not directly induce trophoblast cell death, the intense inflammatory response generated by either the trophoblast or decidual immune cells following its activation may provide an alternative mechanism for the induction of trophoblast apoptosis. ^^^ Thus, we predict that certain intrauterine infections during pregnancy may have either a direct or indirect effect upon trophoblast cell survival, depending upon which TLR is activated. We have also observed that TLR-2 expression in fetal membranes is significantly elevated in women with chorioamnionitis, while TLR-4 expression by interstitial trophoblast cells in increased in patients with preeclampsia.^ Since TLR-4 levels appear to be upregulated by pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNFa,^^^ altered TLR expression may exacerbate certain pathological mechanisms. Together, all these data suggest that while on one hand TLRs fiinction as important sensors for the trophoblast, allowing it to coordinate the local immune response and promote cell invasion and placental formation; TLRs may also provide the bridge for placental recognition of danger signals and a subsequent shift in the type of response generated may have harmfiil consequences for the pregnancy.",

Figure and legend continued on next page. Continued. B) Anti-viral properties of the trophoblast. Trophoblast cells, through TLRs, recognize viral products and actively initiate an anti-viral response by producing interferons and anti-viral peptides. C) In disease, the cross talk between the trophoblast and the maternal immune system is broken. This may arise from unrestrained infection or an excessive inflammatory response due to macrophage, NK cell and neutrophil activation. Both may result in elevated trophoblast apoptosis.",
