Indeed, the critical relevance of proactivity has been evident both in its presence and in it is absence. The urgent need to catch up on testing capability in the USA and the potential insufficiency of the supply of personal protective equipment provide examples of the consequences of inaction.",

The model forebode that within 48 days, a viral pandemic would sicken 110 million Americans, hospitalise 7.7 million and kill 586 000. Such anticipatory behaviour, ideally coupled with commensurate action, is key to understanding the people, roles and resources that are needed when a crisis actually befalls us. As discussed below, the coupling with quick action is key, as modelling without action is a hollow exercise.",

From the earliest signal of disease, laboratory medicine colleagues at my institution were developing testing capability for COVID-19. The result is that as of 20 March 2020, roughly two-thirds of all the positive tests in the US state of Ohio were performed at my institution, where local testing capability was developed early. As another example, medical students, respiratory therapists, intensivists and biomedical engineering colleagues at the Cleveland Clinic are currently advancing designs for a rapid production ventilator in anticipation of a need for ventilators that will exceed supply should a surge occur. Also, in the spirit of \u2018little l\u2019 leadership that can be so impactful, medical students in the Cleveland Clinic Lerner College of Medicine have launched an online repository to identify volunteer activities to help busy interns, residents and fellows.

For example, in the coronavirus crisis, the primacy of supply chain and sourcing personal protective equipment from novel sources, like the paint and construction industries, has become evident as we plan for and ready ourselves for the surge of affected patients. Development of an \u2018incident command\u2019 centre which convenes key leaders regularly, makes real-time decisions based on harvesting the group\u2019s wisdom, and cascades awareness of these decisions broadly is a critical step. Communicating the structure and membership of this incident command team has been an institutional priority. The emphasis on how to organise the institutional response and how to cascade information bespeaks a commitment to \u2018inspiring a shared vision\u2019 and to \u2018enabling others to act\u2019.

Wisdom from Voltaire that \u2018The perfect is the enemy of the good\u2019 and from Confucius that \u2018Better a diamond with a flaw than a pebble without\u20194 is central to being able to act quickly. Leaders must (and, at the Cleveland Clinic) have amply acknowledged fallibility and the inevitability of making mistakes in our response to coronavirus. At the same time, these leaders have reaffirmed that any mistakes will be made in service of the organisation\u2019s mission\u2014\u2018better care of the sick, investigation of their problems, and more teaching of those who serve\u2019 and in the current coronavirus crisis, caring for our patients and protecting our fellow caregivers. Furthermore, creating psychological safety5 is paramount in a crisis because the event calls on harvesting wisdom from every part of the organisation and, indeed, the world. Leaders\u2019 acknowledging their own fallibility in this effort helps create psychological safety, as does leaders\u2019 acknowledging others\u2019 efforts, even if incompletely successful. As has happened at my institution, when leaders acknowledge that in moving quickly, we will naturally make some mistakes, change course repeatedly and revise our thinking, they create space for colleagues to \u2018experiment, take risks, and learn from the accompanying mistakes\u2019.3 Again, this validates the centrality of having psychological safety and of \u2018challenging the process\u2019. Also embedded in acting quickly is the leadership commitment of \u2018enabling others to act\u2019.",

Communication is a critical part of achieving the needed alignment. In the context of George Bernard Shaw\u2019s admonition that \u2018the single biggest problem in communication is the illusion that it has taken place\u2019,6 communication must be frequent, iterative, and must use multiple dissemination media. Virtual meetings to assure communication have ramped up quickly at my institution, with twice daily calls for the command centre, among institute chairpersons, and the executive team. In addition, information is being cascaded to all stakeholder audiences through daily podcasts, emails, and so on. Videos of the CEO, Dr Mihaljevic, communicating with all 66 000 caregivers are regularly posted. Indeed, communication since the very beginning of our planning (on 21 January 2020) has been an absolute priority in service of aligning caregivers and, through forthrightness and compulsive and thorough planning, assuaging anxiety by providing direction about how we will cope and prevail together. The primacy of acting in a synchronised, aligned fashion reflects the very origins of the Cleveland Clinic, which was forged in 1921 in the aftermath of World War I around the concept of \u2018acting as a unit\u2019. In communicating today, leaders are able to connect our current efforts with our deep-seated culture and the organisational DNA.",
