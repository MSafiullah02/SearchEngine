Disease severity varies from moderate to severe for measles (MV) in humans and canine distemper virus (CDV) in dogs to usually lethal for CDV in most wild carnivores and rinderpest in cattle (Rima and Duprex, 2006). Regardless of the ultimate disease outcome, the infection is characterized by a dramatic decrease of white blood cells and an inhibition of lymphocyte proliferation within the first weeks after infection (Borrow and Oldstone, 1995, Griffin, 2001, von Messling et al., 2003). However, the knowledge regarding interactions between the host and the immune system preceding these events remains limited.",

Ferrets are highly sensitive to the disease, and for the most part succumb to infection with a wild type virus. On the other hand, infection with attenuated CDV strains results in disease signs and progression that parallels MV infection in humans (Kauffman et al., 1982). Virus control and clearance in surviving animals usually occur within 3 to 4 weeks after inoculation and coincide with the development of neutralizing antibodies (von Messling et al., 2004, von Messling et al., 2003). The application of our model to study the immune response during the crucial early phase of CDV infection has so far been difficult as specific reagents to detect cytokine responses in ferrets are not readily available.",

As mustelids, ferrets are most closely related to other carnivores like dogs and cats (McKenna and Bell, 1997). The first set of primers was therefore based on canine and feline sequences available in GenBank. We initially obtained small fragments of ferret IFN\u03b1, IFN\u03b3, IL2, IL4, IL6, and TNF\u03b1 and used those sequences to measure cytokine mRNA induction using a gel-based assay (von Messling et al., 2006). To develop a robust and versatile real-time PCR-based assay that generates a representative cytokine profile, we included IL10 and IL12p40 and pursued the sequencing of larger parts of the open reading frames. This strategy has so far yielded complete open reading frames for IL2, IL4, IL6, IFN\u03b1 (consensus sequence), and TNF\u03b1 (GenBank accession nos. IL2 EF368206; IL4 EF368210; IL6 EF368209; IFN\u03b1 EF368207; TNF\u03b1 EF368211) and partial gene sequences for IL10 and IFN\u03b3 (> 95) and IL12p40 (\u223c 60%; GenBank accession nos. IL10 EF368212; IFN\u03b3 EF368214; IL12p40 EF368213). When comparing the ferret cytokines with the respective canine and feline proteins, we observed a slightly higher overall amino acid identity between ferrets and dogs than between ferrets and cats (Table 1\n). This degree of similarity on the amino acid and nucleotide level (data not shown) confirms the identity of the obtained sequences.",

Samples included in the lethal group originated from animals infected with either 5804P-eGFP/H (von Messling et al., 2004) or A75eH (Rudd et al., 2006), whereas the survivor group consisted of individuals inoculated with the highly pathogenic but non-lethal strain 5804P-eGFP/uN (von Messling et al., 2004) or survivors of 5804P/A75eH chimeric viruses. These viruses, in which the envelope glycoproteins were exchanged between the two lethal strains, cause severe disease but only 60\u201380% mortality (unpublished results). In the case of 5804P-eGFP/uN, which carries an eGFP-containing additional transcription unit upstream of the N gene, the non-lethal phenotype is due to a slight delay in replication efficacy, whereas minimal incompatibilities between viral proteins originating from different strains are the likely cause of survival in the case of the 5804P/A75 chimeric viruses.",

To better understand the basis for host immune response control in our ferret model, we established semi-quantitative real-time RT-PCR assays based on ferret cytokine sequences and compared the response associated with lethal disease outcome or survival.

In vitro, it has been demonstrated that minute amounts of MV envelope are suffice to induce an anergic state in exposed lymphocytes, but the exact interactions remain to be elucidated (Schlender et al., 1996). In addition, the non-essential protein V has been shown to inhibit activation of an anti-viral response by interfering with nuclear localization of STATs (Devaux et al., in press, Palosaari et al., 2003). It is possible that the shutdown of cytokine expression observed for the lethal CDV strains results from contacts between viral glycoproteins and immune cells in combination with a V and phosphoprotein-dependent inhibition of the induction of the anti-viral state in infected cells.

They are also used for transmission studies of different transmissible spongiforme encephalopathies (Bartz et al., 1998, Bartz et al., 1994) and parallel human disease manifestations for several bacterial diseases including Helicobacter-induced gastric ulcers, hemolytic uremic syndrome caused by Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli, and campylobacteriosis (O'Rourke and Lee, 2003, Woods et al., 2002). By comparing samples from animals with different disease outcome, we have demonstrated that our semi-quantitative real-time PCR assays are sufficiently sensitive to detect a very weak response and even a reduction from baseline levels as observed in animals that later succumbed to the disease. At the same time, the assays allow the quantification of the response across a much wider range than the previous gel-based approach (von Messling et al., 2006). This will enable the more detailed comparison of the cytokine responses to specifically attenuated viruses in future studies. Furthermore, this RNA-based assay can easily be applied to various tissues as well as bodily fluids, enabling the assessment of the local and systemic responses at the same time. It thus adds a versatile new tool to the study of host\u2013pathogen interactions in this model.",

The real-time PCR was performed in a RG-3000A (Rotor-Gene), using the following protocol: denaturation at 95 \u00b0C for 15 min followed by 40 cycles of 95 \u00b0C for 5 s, 60 \u00b0C for 15 s, and 72 \u00b0C for 25 s, and a melting curve analysis to confirm reaction specificity. Each experiment was performed in triplicate, and only values that varied less than 10% were considered. The fold change ratios between experimental and control samples for each gene were calculated with GAPDH levels as a reference. Towards this the cycle at which GAPDH crosses the detection threshold (Ct) is subtracted from the Ct value of the gene of interest at each time point (\u0394Ct). The fold change is then calculated by subtracting the \u0394Ct values of the respective gene at day 0 from those obtained at subsequent days (\u0394\u0394Ct). To transform these values into absolute values, the formula: fold change = 2\u2212 \u0394\u0394Ct is used (Schmittgen et al., 2000).",
