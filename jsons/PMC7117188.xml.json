            "text": "Feline infectious peritonitis, a significant cause of mortality in domestic cats worldwide, is caused by a virulent biotype of feline coronavirus (FCoV) often referred to as feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) (Pedersen, 2009). As a member of the Family Coronaviridae, FCoV is an enveloped virus with a non-segmented linear single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome of approximately 30 kb (Fig. 1\n). The proximal two-thirds of the genome contain two large open reading frames that encode the non-structural replicase proteins while the four structural proteins; the spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins, and several accessory proteins of unknown function are encoded in the distal one third of the genome (Masters, 2006). There are two antigenically distinct serotypes of FCoV: type I and type II. These serotypes differ primarily in their spike protein, with the type II viruses thought to have arisen from a recombination event with canine coronavirus while the type I viruses are considered wholly feline (Herrewegh et al., 1998). Type I FCoV are more commonly isolated from field cases, however most in vitro studies utilise type II strains due to the difficulty in propagating the former in vitro (Pedersen et al., 2009).",

While most infections are asymptomatic, an unfortunate sequela of FCoV infection in a subset of infected cats is the development of FIP. FIP can occur following exposure to virulent biotypes of FCoV, either through the de novo mutation of a normally avirulent FCoV within an individual animal, the so called internal mutation theory (Chang et al., 2010, Pedersen et al., 2009, Poland et al., 1996, Vennema et al., 1998), or as more recently proposed, through exposure to circulating virulent strains (Brown et al., 2009). Regardless of their origin, the virulent FCoV biotypes demonstrate enhanced replication in cells of the monocyte/macrophage lineage which is thought to trigger the host immune dysregulation and massive systemic inflammatory response seen in FIP (Pedersen, 2009).",

Legendre and Bartges (2009) recently reported the use of a novel immunostimulant in the successful treatment of three cats with non-effusive FIP. This agent however was not effective in treating the more common effusive from of the disease. There are currently no specific antiviral chemotherapeutic agents that are effective in treating either effusive or non-effusive FIP, although a number of drugs have demonstrated in vitro efficacy against FCoV (Barlough and Scott, 1990, Barlough and Shacklett, 1994, Hsieh et al., 2010, Keyaerts et al., 2007). Given the central role of increased FCoV replication in the pathogenesis of FIP (Groot-Mijnes et al., 2005) it is likely that the development of an effective and safe antiviral agent will significantly advance our ability to treat this devastating condition.",

            "text": "RNA interference (RNAi) is a highly conserved post transcriptional gene silencing mechanism found in most eukaryotes that has recently attracted significant attention due to its potential therapeutic applications. RNAi can be induced in mammalian cells via the introduction of short interfering RNAs (siRNAs), \u224821 nucleotide RNA duplexes. Introduced siRNAs are incorporated into an RNA induced silencing complex (RISC) enabling it to bind to and target complementary sequences. Upon binding, an endonuclease within the RISC cleaves the targeted mRNA resulting in sequence specific gene silencing. The in vitro efficacy of RNAi as an antiviral therapeutic has been demonstrated against a range of viral pathogens of medical and veterinary importance from diverse viral families, including HIV-1, influenza, SARS coronavirus, and foot and mouth disease virus (Ge et al., 2003, He et al., 2003, Kahana et al., 2004, Martinez et al., 2002). For some viruses these findings have been extended to in vivo animal models, where induction of a virus specific RNAi response results in a reduction in viral load and the associated pathology (Li et al., 2005a, Tompkins et al., 2004). The aim of this study was to evaluate the antiviral potential of a panel of eight siRNAs targeting four different regions of the FCoV genome using an in vitro assay. The most effective siRNAs were further characterised by examining the effect of multiplicity of infection and siRNA concentration on their inhibitory effect. The information gained from this pilot study is an essential first step to the development of an effective RNAi based treatment for FIP.",

Prospective siRNA sequences were aligned with other reported full- and partial-length FCoV sequences available on GenBank (Benson et al., 2010) using Geneious software (Biomatters Ltd., Auckland, NZ). Criteria for final siRNA selection were (1) high Block-iT\u2122 RNAi designer ranking, (2) sequence homology to other reported FCoV strains, and (3) minimum homology to known feline sequences based on a BLAST search. Using these selection criteria the two highest ranking siRNAs targeting each of the four regions were selected (Table 1\nand Fig. 1). A siRNA (NSC-GFP) was selected targeting green fluorescent protein mRNA to act as a non-silencing control.

The eight siRNAs tested targeted different regions of the FCoV genome, including structural genes (M1, M2, N1, N2), non-structural genes (R1, R2), and untranslated regions (L1, L2). Selection of appropriate siRNA targets is a critical first step in using RNAi as an antiviral therapeutic. As a Baltimore group IV virus, the lifecycle of FCoV theoretically enables the simultaneous degradation of both viral genomic and messenger RNA via RNAi. Additionally, the unique discontinuous transcription mechanism of coronaviruses, resulting in a nested set of subgenomic mRNAs (Masters, 2006), enables targeting of multiple viral mRNAs and viral genomic RNA with a single siRNA. A common leader sequence, which plays a critical role in coronavirus gene expression, is present on the 5\u2032 end of each viral mRNA (Masters, 2006). siRNAs directed against the untranslated leader sequence can target all viral mRNA species and has been reported as an effective method for inhibiting coronavirus replication using an in vitro SARS-CoV model (Li et al., 2005b). Similarly, a number of papers have reported success in inhibiting the replication of SARS-CoV by targeting regions encoding the replicase, membrane, and nucleocapsid proteins (He et al., 2003, He et al., 2006).",

Ideally an antiviral siRNA therapeutic should be effective against all field isolates, and thus conserved regions of the viral genome should be targeted. Such a strategy may also help to limit the development of escape mutants during treatment as highly conserved regions are likely to be structurally or functionally constrained. Our simple approach to siRNA design was able to identify five siRNAs with 100% homology to all reported FCoV strains. A more advanced approach for identifying appropriate siRNA targets in highly divergent viruses, such as that applied by Naito et al. (2006), would likely identify other suitably conserved targets.",

All of the siRNAs tested demonstrated an inhibitory effect on FCoV replication; however the magnitude of inhibition varied significantly. The highly effective siRNAs L2 and N1 were able to reduce extracellular virus titres by >95%, while less effective siRNAs such as L1 resulted in a reduction of approximately 60%. Such variability in potency between different siRNAs is frequently encountered in RNAi studies, even when they target closely associated regions. This is demonstrated in the current study where the L2 siRNA resulted in a greater than 10-fold inhibition in extracellular viral titre compared to the L1 siRNA, despite the two targeting contiguous regions of the genome.",

            "text": "For each treatment, the magnitude of inhibition determined by measurement of virus titre was greater than the inhibition seen in viral genome copy number. Although these two assays are looking at different endpoints, the consistent discrepancy may be in part explained by considering that the qRT-PCR for viral genome is able to detect cleaved, and therefore non-infectious viral genomes, that have not yet been degraded, and thus likely underestimates the potency of the siRNAs. Viral mRNA was also assayed by qRT-PCR. For siRNAs targeting structural genes, the knockdown of the respective mRNA was greater than the knockdown of viral genome. This finding may be due to the viral genome being at least partially protected from the effects of these siRNAs, perhaps due to their association with viral proteins. A critical step in virus assembly is genome encapsidation by the N protein to form a helical nucleocapsid (Masters, 2006). The tight genome\u2013N protein interaction may serve to partially protect progeny genomes from RNAi mediated degradation through steric hindrance of RISC access to the target site, as has been suggested for other viruses (Bitko and Barik, 2001, Hu et al., 2002). Differences in RNA secondary structure between the smaller viral mRNA and the full length genomic copies may also limit target site accessibility (Shao et al., 2007). Alternatively, the difference may be attributed to the smaller mRNAs being degraded more rapidly following RISC mediated cleavage than the larger full length genome copies.",

To assess the usefulness of the siRNAs in a therapeutic setting siRNAs L2 and N1 were tested at higher moi \u2013 0.2, 2, and 20. The development of FIP is associated with high viral loads, and it was considered that the higher moi would more accurately mimic the findings in a natural infection (Kipar et al., 2006). Both siRNAs remained effective, showing greater than 75% inhibition of extracellular virus compared to the control samples even when challenged with a 100-fold increase in virus. As with the earlier experiments the reduction demonstrated in viral genome copies is less than the reduction in extracellular virus production. Again, a likely explanation is that qRT-PCR will detect non-infectious cleaved genomic RNA prior to its degradation. This hypothesis would explain the significantly increased N1 qRT-PCR results compared with L2 results, as the target site and the location of the PCR primers in the former are separated by over 25 kb.",

Translation of in vitro results into an animal model requires the development of an appropriate delivery system. Delivery options for RNAi include chemical modifications to the siRNA duplex and lipid- and polymer-based delivery systems (Akhtar and Benter, 2007). Direct conjugation strategies which allow for targeted delivery of siRNAs to specific tissues and cell types will enhance the activity of siRNAs in vivo and reduce unwanted effects (Akhtar and Benter, 2007). Additional complications associated with RNAi in vivo are off-target effects. siRNA sequences used in this study were subjected to a BLAST search to identify and eliminate any anti-FCoV siRNAs with significant homology to feline genes. The current light coverage of the feline genome (1.9-fold) means that homologous feline sequences may be missed during BLAST search, resulting in unexpected and potentially adverse off-target effects. More in depth coverage of the feline genome will help to reduce the chances of off-target effects, however as many of the off-target effects are mediated by the micro RNA pathway, and can be triggered by limited sequence homology in the seed region of the siRNA (Jackson and Linsley, 2010), it is more appropriate to talk of minimising off-target effects rather than avoiding them (Behlke, 2006).",
