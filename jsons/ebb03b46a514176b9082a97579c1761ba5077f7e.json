In turn, our deepening In order to productively infect a target cell, viruses and intracellular bacteria utilize 47 diverse techniques to prevent activation of cGAS before they initiate replication ( Figure 2 In the event that viral DNA is exposed in the cytosol prior to replication and gene 62 expression, the nuclear-replicating herpesviruses carry immune antagonists directly within the 63 viral particle to disable DNA sensing after infection. Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) VP22 and 64 human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) UL83 are both tegument proteins which bind cGAS and block 65 downstream signaling [23, 24] . Another member of the Herpesviridae, Kaposi's sarcoma-66 associated herpesvirus (KSHV), also encodes a tegument protein that inhibits cGAS, ORF52 67 (also named KicGAS) [25] . ORF52 blocks cGAS activation through a mechanism which requires 68 both cGAS and DNA binding by ORF52. While these proteins from diverse herpesviruses 69 seemingly vary in their requirement for DNA binding activity, they share striking similarities in 70 that each is carried within the virion to bind cGAS and block immune activation after infection. 71 HCMV expresses two additional proteins which interfere with cGAS-DNA binding and formation 72 of higher-order complexes, UL31 and UL42 [26, 27] . Likewise, cytoplasmic isoforms of the KSHV 73 LANA protein have been shown to bind cGAS, and block downstream signaling [28] . Given new 74 data demonstrating that cGAS phase separates with DNA, it is tempting to speculate that some 75 or all of these proteins interfere individually or collaboratively with multivalent cGAS-DNA 76 binding, thus restricting phase separation and altering the balance of innate immune sensing in 77 favor of viral replication. 78",

Poxin is highly specific for host 2\u20323\u2032-cGAMP, and deletion of poxin 114 from the viral genome resulted in attenuation of VACV in a mouse model of infection. Functional 115 poxin enzymes are also found in the genomes of insect viruses in the family Baculoviridae, and 116 moths and butterflies, which serve as hosts to these viruses [33] . The emerging role for cGAS-117 STING signaling in insects is likely to enable discovery of additional insect pathogen inhibitors of 118 pathway activation [40] [41] [42] . In mammals, no cytosolic enzymes have been discovered which 119 degrade 2\u20323\u2032-cGAMP, but instead the extracellular enzyme ectonucleotide 120 pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase family member 1 (ENPP1) has been shown to be the 121 major source of 2\u20323\u2032-cGAMP-degrading activity in mammalian tissue and plasma [43] . 122",

Deamidation of a single asparagine residue in this loop by UL37 83 results in significantly impaired 2\u20323\u2032-cGAMP production, perhaps by blocking this switch-like 84 conformational change. 85 Many open questions remain in the field regarding how cGAS senses pathogen 86 infection. The nature of the cGAS ligand during infection with different pathogens remains whether it is always the viral or bacterial genome, or to what extent oxidative stress 88 and exposure of mitochondrial DNA or cellular genomic DNA may play a role in cGAS activation 89 during infection remains a topic of debate. Further, a striking number of viral cGAS antagonists 90 serve as virion structural components, including several herpesvirus tegument proteins, and 91 VACV F17. Given that virion stability and efficiency of viral DNA packaging may influence 92 cytosolic DNA sensing during infection, further work to establish the exact mechanisms by 93 which these proteins antagonize cGAS-STING signaling will provide important insight to help 94 unite our understanding of their structural and immune antagonist roles. 95 96 Pathogens degrade 2\u20323\u2032-cGAMP to block STING activation 97 The nucleotide second messenger 2\u20323\u2032-cGAMP is highly stable in the mammalian cytosol 98 [33]. This RNA signal can be disseminated through gap junctions to activate STING signaling in 99 adjacent uninfected bystander cells, bypassing pathogen factors targeting STING in the infected 100 cell [34]. Similarly, 2\u20323\u2032-cGAMP can be packaged within nascent virions, driving a rapid immune 101 response upon infection of a new target cell [35,36]. These aspects of 2\u20323\u2032-cGAMP biology make 102 it a critical target for elimination by viral and bacterial pathogens (Figure 3). 103 Cyclic dinucleotide phosphodiesterase (CdnP) proteins of Mycobacterium and 104",

            "text": "170Certain pathogens have adapted to benefit from STING activation during infection. The 171 intracellular bacterium L. monocytogenes secretes cyclic di-AMP directly into the cytosol of an 172 infected cell, which binds and drives activation of STING[66]. Activation of STING in this 173 context appears to prevent the induction of protective immunity to Listeria. This indicates that 174Listeria, and potentially other pathogens, may strategically manipulate STING for their own 175 benefit, embracing and dysregulating signaling, rather than evading it.176 Viral factors targeting the activation of STING provide a platform to gain a greater and 177 more mechanistic understanding of this process. The details of how STING becomes activated 178 after binding to 2\u20323\u2032-cGAMP in cells remain incomplete -it is unclear how oligomerization might 179 regulate STING trafficking, and likewise at what step post-translation modifications are applied 180 to STING and exactly how they regulate signaling. Many factors produced by pathogens 181 interfere with these processes, and future systematic study of those acting at different points 182 may provide increased insight into the cell biological processes underlying STING activation. 183 Further, recent STING structures in complex with TBK1 now provide a framework for structural 184 study of factors like KSHV vIRF1 and HSV-1 ICP27 which act on the STING/TBK1 signalosome 185 to prevent downstream immune activation. The details of how STING recruits other downstream 186 factors aside from TBK1 and IRF3 are still unclear, but recent work shows that the HIV-2 Vpx 187 protein can selectively inhibit STING-mediated NF-\u03baB activation [67], providing an opportunity to 188 better understand this process. 189 Open questions and future prospects 191 In the short time since the discovery of cGAS-STING signaling, viral and bacterial factors 192 targeting nearly every step in this pathway have been identified. However, for most of these 193 factors, the specific molecular details of how these factors inhibit cGAS and STING have not 194 been determined. How do pathogen factors recognize and interact with cGAS and STING on a 195 molecular level, and how has viral targeting shaped the structure and regulation of these 196 proteins? Could viral or bacterial inhibitors of cGAS or STING make useful therapeutics for 197 treating autoimmune diseases? cGAS was recently identified as part of a large family of 198 bacterial cGAS/DncV-like nucleotidyltransferase (CD-NTase) enzymes, encompassing 199 thousands of homologs which drive immunity to phage through the action of numerous distinct 200 downstream effectors including STING-like proteins. [68-70]. Could bacteriophages share 201 strategies, or perhaps even conserved mechanisms of immune evasion with mammalian 202 viruses? Phage are known to encode anti-CRISPR nucleases to degrade a cyclic 203 oligoadenylate second-messenger for evasion of Type III CRISPR systems [71] raising the 204 question of whether these viruses might also encode enzymes functionally similar to poxin for 205 evasion of CD-NTase signaling. Intervention by pathogens has often provided important new 206insight into basic biological processes, and future studies of cGAS-STING signaling must 207 continue to harness the power of viruses and bacteria to generate answers to these questions. 208 Hornung V: cGAS produces a 2\u2032-5\u2032-linked cyclic dinucleotide second messenger 224 that activates STING.",

Oligomerization into a minimal 2:2 cGAS:DNA complex is 493 required for activation to produce the second messenger 2\u20323\u2032-cGAMP from ATP and GTP. 2\u20323\u2032-494 cGAMP is subsequently recognized by STING which oligomerizes to form a signalosome 495 complex and traffics to the ERGIC and perinuclear regions. This leads to recruitment of the 496 downstream kinase TBK1 to promote innate immune signaling. Points in the pathway which are 497 known (checked box) or potential (red open box) pathogen targets for restriction of cGAS-498 STING signaling are summarized on the right in the viral escape checklist. 499 Pathogen factors block cGAS activation 501 Upon DNA binding, cGAS undergoes a conformational change activating 2\u20323\u2032-cGAMP synthesis. 502Assembly into a minimal 2:2 complex is required for catalytic activity, but further assembly into 503 long DNA ladder structures and larger oligomers bridged by interactions with the unstructured 504 N-terminus results in formation of phase-separated liquid droplets. ATP and GTP are converted 505 in a two-step process to 2\u20323\u2032-cGAMP within the cGAS active site, which is released into the 506 cytosol and diffuses throughout the cell.

The downstream kinase TBK1 is 521 recruited into the STING signalosome, driving trans-phosphorylation and activation of this 522 kinase to promote downstream IRF3 binding and activation of type I interferon signaling.

For 48 example, viruses with a DNA genome or genome intermediate (e.g. herpesviruses, and 49 retroviruses), must prevent exposure of DNA to the cytosol, or risk activation of cGAS. These 50 viruses shield DNA from sensing within the viral capsid until it reaches the nucleus, and 51 mutations altering capsid stability regulate cytosolic DNA sensing [19,20]. 52 Another strategy to prevent or restrict cGAS activation is to target cGAS for degradation, 53 reducing levels of this sensor, and impairing 2\u20323\u2032-cGAMP synthesis. This is accomplished in 54 different ways by both DNA and RNA viruses. For example, the dengue virus (DENV) protease 55 complex NS2B3 cleaves cGAS to prevent its activation by mitochondrial DNA during infection 56 [11]. The related flavivirus Zika virus (ZIKV) utilizes an indirect strategy: its NS1 protein 57 stabilizes caspase-1 leading to cGAS cleavage [21]. Another indirect strategy is utilized by DNA 58 viruses in the Poxviridae family, where the vaccinia virus (VACV) F17 protein dysregulates 59 mTOR, leading to enhanced cGAS degradation and impaired cytosolic DNA sensing late in 60",

            "text": ". In addition, the HCMV IE86 protein promotes STING degradation in the 139 proteasome, restricting activation of downstream signaling[47]. 140Several processes, including oligomerization[13,48], palmitoylation[49,50],K63-linked  141   ubiquitination [51,52], and ER to ERGIC trafficking[53,54]  are reported to be important for 142 assembly of the STING signalosome and activation of downstream signaling. It remains unclear 143 how these different processes may regulate one another, but interestingly, a number of 144 pathogen factors interfere with one or more steps. Two RNA virus factors, Hepatitis C virus 145 NS4B, and the coronavirus HCoV-NL63 papain-like protease (PL-pro) both interfere with STING 146 oligomerization [55,56]. Interestingly, it is the deubiquitinase activity rather than the protease 147 activity of PL-pro that is required for antagonism of STING oligomer formation [56]. Several 148 other pathogen factors have been discovered which appear to interfere specifically with STING 149 ubiquitination, including the human T-lymphotrophic virus 1 Tax protein [57], and Yersinia YopJ 150 protein, which also functions as a deubiquitinase [58]. YopJ is additionally reported to block 151 STING ER to ERGIC trafficking, perhaps implying a connection between these processes [58]. 152 Several viral proteins directly target STING trafficking to the ERGIC, which requires the 153 iRhom2/TRAP\u03b2 complex [54]. The HCMV tegument protein UL82 disrupts the complex between 154 STING, iRhom2 and TRAP\u03b2 [59]. Similarly, HCMV UL42, along with its role in antagonizing 155 cGAS oligomerization, is reported to stimulate degradation of TRAP\u03b2 in order to block STING 156 trafficking [27]. Last, the bacterium Shigella flexneri encodes IpaJ which inhibits STING 157 trafficking by an indirect mechanism, targeting ARF GTPases to block traffic out of the ER [60]. 158 After assembly of STING oligomers in the ERGIC, downstream signaling factors 159 associate in order to drive antiviral and inflammatory responses. The mechanism is best 160 understood for the kinase TBK1 and transcription factor IRF3 which associate with the STING 161 C-terminal tail and become activated by trans-phosphorylation driven by assembly of multiple 162 molecules on adjacent STING monomers [13,14,61]. The KSHV vIRF1 protein blocks this 163 process, preventing association of TBK1 [62]. Mareck's disease virus is an avian oncogenic herpesvirus, and its oncoprotein Meq functions in a similar way, blocking recruitment of TBK1 to 165 STING in chicken cells [63]. Interestingly, the oncoproteins E1A and E7 from adenovirus and 166 human papillomavirus also bind and inhibit STING, however the mechanistic consequences of 167 binding have not yet been elucidated [64]. HSV-1 ICP27 functions differently, associating with 168 the active STING/TBK1 complex, and preventing IRF3 recruitment and phosphorylation to block 169 the downstream type I interferon response [65].",
