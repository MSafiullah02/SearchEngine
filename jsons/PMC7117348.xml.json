Intimin, a 94 kDa outer membrane protein encoded by the eae gene, mediates adherence of AEEC to intestinal epithelial cells; an event critical for the formation of the attaching and effacing lesion (Jerse and Kaper, 1991; Donnenberg and Kaper, 1992). Thus, the pathophysiologic mechanism by which AEEC cause the attaching and effacing lesion in the intestinal tract of calves may follow the three-stage model proposed for human strains of enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) (Donnenberg and Kaper, 1992; Donnenberg et al., 1993a, Donnenberg et al., 1993b). The three-stage model for the attaching and effacing lesion consists of localized adherence, signal transduction, and intimate adherence. There is an initial nonintimate attachment of the bacteria to intestinal epithelial cells leading to effacement of the underlying microvilli, followed by intimate attachment, and then the accumulation of cytoskeletal proteins beneath the areas of bacterial attachment.",

Thus, two classes of bovine AEEC have been described (Mainil et al., 1993). One class, in addition to carrying the eae gene, carry stx genes; and the second class do not carry stx genes. In calves, the eae gene and intimin have a defined role in causing the attaching and effacing lesion, whereas Shiga toxins do not appear to have a role in causing the attaching and effacing lesion (Tzipori et al., 1987; Hall et al., 1990). Further, the importance of Shiga toxins in calf diarrhea and systemic disease is not well defined. In humans, Shiga toxins are an essential virulence attribute of EHEC associated with severe systemic disease such as hemolytic uremic syndrome (Karmali, 1989; Tesh and O'Brien, 1991). In pigs and rabbits, Shiga toxins have a role in inducing vascular lesions and have a direct effect on the intestinal epithelium (Gyles, 1994; Nataro and Kaper, 1998).",

However, significantly more eae\n+ and eae/stx\n+\nE. coli that exhibited single and multiple antimicrobial resistances were isolated from diarrheic calves. Selection for resistance among the strains from diarrheic calves may have been due to a greater use of antimicrobials among the diarrheic calves. Based on limited observations made with 10 calves on one farm, a relation between antimicrobial use and selection for resistance was observed. Three of 10 calves developed diarrhea after being treated for respiratory disease. All three calves were subsequently positive for eae\n+ (one calf) and eae/stx\n+\nE. coli (two calves). Two of the three strains were resistant to the antimicrobial used to treat the respiratory disease. Examination of E. coli from the seven healthy calves did not reveal any eae\n+, eae/stx\n+\nE. coli or commensal E. coli strains that were resistant to that antimicrobial. In this case, exposure to the particular antimicrobial appeared to select for resistance. However, environmental sources of the resistant strains could not be excluded (Linton, 1986).",

Although the influence of enterohemolysin on calf intestinal disease has not been defined, it has been suggested that enterohemolysins may compliment the effects of Shiga toxins (Nataro and Kaper, 1998). Furthermore, screening for enterohemolysin has been proposed as a diagnostic marker for Shiga toxin producing E. coli (Beutin et al., 1989; Wieler et al., 1995), since its presence is strongly correlated with Shiga toxins. Among bovine Shiga toxin producing E. coli, enterohemolysin activity has been reported to range from 57.6% to 70.8% (Beutin et al., 1989; Wieler et al., 1992).

            "text": "Strains of AEEC belonging to the same serogroups were often isolated from healthy and diarrheic calves. Strains belonging to serogroups O5, O26, and O111 accounted for 43.0% of all the typable strains, and for 45.0% and 39.0% of the typable strains from healthy and diarrheic calves, respectively. Characterization of AEEC by O group only is less powerful than O:H typing since strains of the same O group but possessing different H antigens may have different virulence properties. Nevertheless, determination of specific virulence attributes and the association with specific O groups provide valuable epidemiologic information (Wieler et al., 1992). Attaching and effacing E. coli belonging to serogroups O5, O26, and O111 are widely distributed among calves and have been demonstrated in natural outbreaks and experimentally (with some strains) to cause diarrhea and dysentery (Chanter et al., 1984, Chanter et al., 1986; Hall et al., 1985, Hall et al., 1990; Schoonderwoerd et al., 1988; Wray et al., 1989; Moxley and Francis, 1986; Mainil et al., 1993; Janke et al., 1990; Knutton, 1994; Butler and Clarke, 1994; Dorn et al., 1993). As calf AEEC have a similar pathophysiologic mechanism to human EPEC and EHEC, strains carrying both eae and stx genes, and belonging to serogroups O negative, O5, O8, O26, O55, O69, O84/172, O98, O103, O111, O118, O157 and 0171 would be of concern to human health.",

Based on the distribution of the eae gene among calves of various ages, it appears that an age-associated resistance does not occur during the first week of life as is recognized with ETEC. Furthermore, the mean ages of the healthy (25.5 days) and diarrheic (24.3 days) calves infected with eae\n+\nE. coli would support the notion that calves older than 21 days are more susceptible to infection with eae\n+\nE. coli. However, this does not mean that the infected calves would develop attaching and effacing lesions. The age of calves infected with eae\n+\nE. coli and those that had demonstrable attaching and effacing lesions ranged from 8 to 83 days. In natural infections, calves as young as 2 days and as old as 4 months have been described with attaching and effacing lesions (Janke et al., 1990).",
