Patients with cancer are at particularly high risk of becoming infected with COVID-19 4 and of developing severe complications or dying of the disease. 5 In fact, in one report detailing the incidence and outcomes of COVID-19 infection in a cohort of cancer patients treated at a tertiary cancer center in Wuhan, the rate of death was a staggering 25%. 6 As clinicians caring for cancer patients during this pandemic, we must carefully balance efforts to minimize patient visits to the hospital, while still adequately treating their malignancies. Not only are we required to change practice in order to minimize the number of patient visits to the clinic to decrease the risk of exposure to coronavirus, but practices may be forced to change due to operating room closures and staff shortages, as employees become ill and are forced to stay home and quarantine. As inpatient wards are becoming less safe for cancer patients due to the increased risk of exposure to the disease, treatment of patients in an outpatient setting is preferred when possible.",

The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence issued a guideline which includes a risk stratification system for patients needing radiation to help in making management decisions. 7 When radiation therapy is indicated, efforts should be made to reduce the number of treatment fractions delivered. Reducing the number of patients receiving radiation therapy, as well as the number of treatments received, is critically important during the COVID-19 pandemic, not only to benefit the patient being treated, but also for a number of other reasons beyond the individual benefit. First, it minimizes exposure and risk of all patients and staff to the virus. Second, radiation therapy, especially when delivered concurrently with chemotherapy, may cause lymphopenia which is likely to persist over the course of therapy, resulting in immunosuppression and thus increased susceptibility to the virus.",

For patients with squamous cell histology, consider CRT alone, without surgery, based on the 49% pathological complete response rate in the CROSS trial. 11 3. Inoperable esophageal cancer: a. Definitive CRT: For inoperable patients, the maximum dose of radiation should not exceed 50Gy in 25 fractions, as higher doses are ineffective and may even be detrimental. 19; 20 Weekly carboplatin/paclitaxel is the preferred concurrent chemotherapy regimen due to only once weekly administration. Concurrent FOLFOX is another good option due to administration every 2 weeks. 13 For centers where radiation facilities are particularly strained, 40Gy in 15 fractions can be considered. This should be followed by 2 cycles of chemotherapy (with fluorouracil and cisplatin) as per RTOG 85-01. 21; 22 4. Definitive RT: Patients who are not suitable for chemotherapy can receive RT with a hypofractionated regimen of either 50Gy in either 16 or 20 fractions. 23 It should be noted that this recommendation was somewhat controversial among authors due to concerns over the potential for increased late toxicity. 35 Although radiation therapy has been suggested to have a benefit following systemic therapy, due to the lack of level 1 data, radiation therapy should not be used in the adjuvant setting during COVID-19.",

Radiation is preferred over either an esophageal stent or percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube placement in order to avoid consumption of limited operative supplies and aerosolization of the virus secondary to intubation. While 30Gy in 10 fractions is a common palliative regimen, shorter courses such as 6-8Gy in a single fraction for pain or bleeding, or 20Gy in 5 fractions for dypshagia, can be used to minimize patient visits -operative chemotherapy: For patients with newly diagnosed non-metastatic gastric cancer, treatment with chemotherapy using the FLOT regimen (fluorouracil, leucovorin, oxaliplatin, docetaxel), should be offered to patients regardless of stage. 26 b. Neoadjuvant CRT: Preoperative CRT should not be used given the lack of data showing benefit over chemotherapy alone. 27; 28 c. Adjuvant therapy: Postoperative radiation therapy should not be routinely administered to patients with gastric cancer due to lack of data demonstrating a benefit. 29; 30 Ten percent of patients in the CRITICS trial, which failed to show a benefit to postoperative CRT, had an R1 resection; 29 thus it is unclear if adjuvant CRT should be offered to patients even in the setting of microscopically positive surgical margins. In all patients who did not receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy, adjuvant chemotherapy should be administered. The role of adjuvant CRT can be considered in cases with very high risk features (e.g. lymphovascular space invasion, node positive, high grade histology, positive margin) after 3-4 months of chemotherapy, taking into consideration the state of the crisis. d. Palliation: Radiation therapy should be strictly reserved for palliation of symptoms in patients with gastric cancer at the present time. When choosing a palliative regimen, for bleeding for example, 6 or 8 Gy in one fraction, with an anti-emetic, may be used. 31; 32 Hepatocellular carinoma (HCC) 1. Early stage HCC: a. Orthotopic liver transplanation (OLT): OLT provides the highest chance of cure for HCC patients who meet transplant eligibility criteria and who receive a donor liver. During COVID-19, live donor transplantation is likely to be put on hold, and there may be delays or transient suspension of all transplants. Thus, there is an increased role for 'bridging therapies,'designed to maintain the HCC within eligibility criteria for transplant, possibly for longer times than pre COVID-19. Radiofrequency ablation (RFA), transarterial chemo-embolization (TACE), yittrium-90 (Y90), and stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) may be used to bridge HCCs that are at risk of growing to a stage where the patient would be delisted. b. Surgery: Resection is a curative treatment for patients with early stage tumors (single, no vascular invasion or extraheaptic spread). There is no role for neoadjuvant therapy; however during COVID-19, if resection is not possible, alternative therapies (as suggested below) may be used instead of resection; and resection may be avoided or delayed to the time of progression.",

As with SBRT for other gastrointestinal sites, we recommend use of noninvasive procedures for tumor localization and tracking at this time (4DCT, abdominal compression, biliary stents as surrogate markers) for centers that typically use fiducials for localization. 2. Unresectable/locally advanced: a. Chemotherapy: Patients with unresectable pancreatic cancer should be treated with up to six months of chemotherapy alone with FOLFIRINOX, for medically fit patients, or gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel for those with relatively poorer performance who are still candidates for combination chemotherapy. 27; 46; 47b. Radiation therapy: The role of radiation therapy in patients with unresectable pancreatic cancer was somewhat controversial among the authors of this manuscript due to lack of survival benefit.48 If there is stability or improvement of local disease after four to six months of systemic treatment, in the absence of distant metastases, centers with SBRT capability may consider offering radiation.49; 50  . Patients with local progression after chemotherapy are likely to be incurable and thus the role of radiotherapy in these patients is unclear. A single fraction of 8-10Gy may be considered for palliation of symptoms or to prevent future symptoms in patients with local progression.51 3. Following resection: a. Negative margins: There is no role for the routine use of adjuvant radiation therapy at this time, given the lack of high-quality prospective data to support its use.b. Positive margins: Adjuvant chemotherapy should be administered to complete a full course of six months of chemotherapy. If neoadjuvant chemotherapy was given prior to surgery, additional adjuvant chemotherapy should not exceed the total of six months.During COVID-19, radiation therapy should be omitted due to the lack of level 1 data demonstrating a benefit.",

TACE or Y90 are suitable for most early stage HCCs, however, these may not be available at centers restricting procedures due to COVID-19, increasing the number of patients referred for SBRT. 3. SBRT is an alternative ablative therapy that may be used, especially if inpatient and invasive procedures have been suspended. SBRT may be delivered in 1-5 fractions; 3-5 fractions are preferred for central HCCs near the biliary tree (especially if a transplant is planned). Please see Table 1 for dosing schema. Noninvasive procedures for prediction and mitigation of tumor motion (use of 4DCT, abdominal compression, daily imaging, and surrogate markers such as biliary stents or lipiodol from previous TACE) are preferred to use of fiducials given that fiducial placement is risky at this time 2. Following resection: There is no proven role for adjuvant therapy. 3. Intermediate stage HCC: a. TACE or Y90: The current treatment paradigm for multifocal HCC is TACE or Y90. b. SBRT: SBRT may be proposed as an alternative option, particularly after incomplete response to prior TACE. 33 . 4. Locally advanced HCC, with vascular invasion: a. Systemic therapy: Treatment with molecularly targeted therapy (e.g sorafenib or lenvatinib) should be used during COVID-19 in eligible patients. b. Local therapy: Radiation therapy with TACE was shown to improve survival versus TACE alone in HCC patients with vascular invasion, 34 and SBRT is being studied in other randomized trials (eg. RTOG1112). For patients who continue to have HCC confined to the liver following systemic therapy, or for those who are not eligble for systemic therapy, SBRT may be considered, if available. c. Best supportive care: For patients with a poor prognosis, e.g. due to massive HCC or declining liver function, best supportive care, rather than active intervention, should be offered. For tumor-related pain, a single fraction of 6-8Gy can be considered. Neoadjuvant therapy: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (preferably with capecitabine as this can be taken at home) may be considered for patients with operable cholangiocarcinoma in order to delay surgery, extrapolating from data showing benefit to adjuvant therapy. 2. Following resection: a. Negative margins: For patients who have had surgery, adjuvant therapy with oral capecitabine is recommended, as per BilCap, as it can be taken at home.",

Adjuvant therapy: For patients with clinical stage I disease who underwent upfront resection and were upstaged at the time of surgery, adjuvant chemotherapy should be delivered. The role of CRT should be carefully considered on an individual patient basis weighing risks and benefits. For a low risk of local failure, radiation therapy may be deferred. If indicated, long-course CRT is preferred. 4. Inoperable: a. Definitive CRT: For patients who are inoperable due to medical co-morbidities, the first line of therapy should be chemotherapy. For those who continue to have local cancer following chemotherapy, definitive radiation therapy may be considered.
