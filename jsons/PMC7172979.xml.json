Data suggest that ART patients would rather attend clinics less frequently and prefer MMD of ART over other DSD model components.5 MMD is expected to result in cost savings to both service providers and patients.6,7 Clinics that are decongested of stable ART patients may be able to increase the rate of new ART initiations to scale-up ART coverage,8 allow clinic resources to be redirected toward ill patients in need of clinic care, and support ART retention by improving clinic efficiency and reducing unnecessary patient waiting times.",

Few studies have yet assessed clinical outcomes of community-based ART delivered as infrequently as twice annually with only annual clinical consultations.10 The optimal interval and delivery method for ART in terms of safety and efficacy has not been defined, and robust data to evaluate DSD models are critically required to inform evidence-based policy decisions.13",

CARGs consisted of 6-12 people, with participants living in a similar geographic location and attending the same health facility. Participants in 3MC and 6MC were recruited from newly formed CARGs (<3 months) in which members had not yet had their first CARG refill meeting. These CARG members received viral load (VL) testing to ascertain stability and eligibility for the study. A CARG leader was nominated, and the CARG met on at least a three-monthly basis at a venue of their choice in the community. Dependent on the individual group need for peer adherence support, CARGs were free to meet more often, but these additional meetings were not compulsory and did not include ART distribution. For the 3MC arm, a single alternating CARG representative collected ART from the facility on a three-monthly basis and distributed the medicines to all other CARG members at the CARG meeting on the same or the following day. Stable 3MC participants were scheduled to receive a clinical consultation and VL test at the facility twelve months after enrollment. All participants from a particular CARG were scheduled to attend this clinic visit on the same day and to collect their ART supply from the clinic at this visit. For the 6MC arm, a single CARG representative collected ART from the facility 6 months after enrollment and distributed to all CARG members at the CARG meeting on the same or the following day. After 12 months, 6MC participants were scheduled to receive a clinical consultation, VL testing and ART supply from the clinic, with all members from a CARG scheduled to attend on the same day. Participants in the control arm (3MF) received clinical consultations and collected their own ART supply at the facility three-monthly.

This suggests that expanded implementation of MMD in community-based groups is an effective way to deliver ART to large numbers of stable ART patients, which can allow decongestion of health care facilities enabling clinics to focus on increasing ART initiation and management of ill and complicated patients. Participants in the CARG arms were scheduled to receive clinical assessments at the clinics only annually (unless clinically unwell), and cost savings may be realized through devolving ART delivery to the community, reducing patient loads at overburdened facilities, improving efficiency of the healthcare system, and reducing patients transport costs and the inconvenience and opportunity costs associated with frequent facility visits.6 Six-monthly MMD may have added benefit for patients associated with rural hospitals, as these are likely to be further from patients' homes and had retention below 90% in the three-monthly arms. Although enrolled numbers were very small, retention among those with baseline CD4 count <200 cells/\u00b5L was high, suggesting that these DSD models may possibly be suitable for less stable patients. Recent qualitative work in Zimbabwe has also shown that health care workers and patients overwhelmingly perceive CARGs as beneficial.30",

There were substantial differences in VL completion between study districts, with Chitungwiza (the single urban district) having substantially better VL testing infrastructure than other districts. No sites in Chitungwiza were allocated to 6MC, and VL completion was reduced in this arm. Nevertheless, VL completion remained reduced in 6MC when excluding all sites allocated to Chitungwiza, thus it is possible that the 6MC model may be associated with lower VL uptake. Also, VL testing cannot be assumed to be random at facilities with very low VL completion, thus conclusions about VS in this arm cannot be drawn from this data. At facilities with low VL completion, targeted VL testing may have occurred among participants that clinicians were more concerned about having poor adherence. Few studies have measured virological outcomes of patients receiving ART as infrequently as twice annually with annual clinical consulations.10 Further studies are needed to precisely measure VL completion and suppression among six-monthly MMD patients. Where feasible, VL uptake and VS should be closely monitored during routine implementation of six-monthly MMD in CARGs.

Study data collection had a minimal impact on routine site clinical procedures; hence, study findings are representative of the realities of routine HIV program settings. Study limitations include that the availability of VL testing varied between sites and districts due to variable expansion of VL testing scale-up. This affected eligibility for the study as only those with suppressed VLs were eligible, and there was differential exclusion between arms due to VL result unavailability. Differential availability of 12-month VL results between arms also affected ITT analyses of VS. VL testing may have been nonrandom at sites with low VL completion, with possible targeted VL testing among higher-risk participants. As formation of CARGs during the enrollment period was slower than anticipated, the enrollment target was not met in 3MC and 6MC due to fewer than anticipated patients in newly formed CARGs being available for screening. The sample of participants aged 18-24 years was very small, thus conclusions regarding this age group cannot be drawn. As the selected sites included only one urban hospital (which was subsequently allocated to 6MC), no 3MF or 3MC participants attended urban hospitals. The study design did not include the element of patient choice regarding DSD model, although choice may often be a feature of DSD implementation in routine settings.32 In addition, participant outcomes were limited to one year after enrollment. Retention and VS may decline over time, and studies are needed to evaluate longer-term outcomes.",

Retention was found to be high among participants receiving ART at three- and six-monthly intervals in CARGs, being noninferior compared with standard-of-care facility-based three-monthly ART delivery. VS was high in the three-month CARG arm. VS was marginally reduced in the six-monthly CARG arm; however, conclusions could not be drawn due to low VL completion in this arm. Lower VS in this group may indicate slightly lower adherence or targeted VL testing among those participants that clinicians were more concerned about. Close monitoring of VL completion and VS is warranted for this group. Future studies should evaluate clinical outcomes of MMD in community-based groups beyond one year of follow-up, including measuring adherence, precise measurement of VS, cost outcomes, and qualitative experiences. Expanded VL infrastructure will further enhance eligibility for and the monitoring of patients receiving DSD.",
