However, only one antifungal peptide has been reported from Brassica campestris seeds (Lin et al. 2007) despite the existence of many Brassica species. The seeds of Brassica campestris and B. parachinensis have medicinal use in traditional Chinese medicine. The aim of the present study was to purify an antifungal peptide from the seeds of B. parachinensis, to compare it with the antifungal peptide previously isolated from B. campestris seeds (Lin et al. 2007), and to ascertain other potentially exploitable activities of the peptide.",

After the agar had cooled down, a small amount of mycelia, the same amount to each plate, was added. Buffer only, without containing antifungal peptide, served as a control. After incubation at 23\u00b0C for 72 h, the area of the mycelial colony was measured, and the inhibition of fungal growth determined. The concentration of the isolated antifungal peptide that brought about 50% reduction in the area of mycelial colony is the IC50 (Wang and Ng 2000). The IC50 could be read off from a graph plotting % reduction in mycelial colony area against concentration of antifungal peptide. Percentage of reduction of mycelial colony area is calculated as (Mycelial colony area in absence of antifungal peptide \u2013 mycelial colony area in presence of antifungal peptide) \u00f7 mycelial colony area in absence of antifungal peptide \u00d7 100%. Nystatin and a defensin\u2010like peptide (Wong and Ng 2003) were used as positive controls. French bean hemagglutinin (Leung et al. 2008) was used as a negative control.

            "text": "The assay for HIV reverse transcriptase inhibitory activity was carried out in accordance with instructions supplied with the assay kit from Boehringer Mannheim (Germany) since some antifungal proteins possess this activity. The assay takes advantage of the ability of reverse transcriptase to synthesize DNA, starting from the template/primer hybrid poly (A) oligo (dT) 15. The digoxigenin\u2010 and biotin\u2010labelled nucleotides in an optimized ratio are incorporated into one of the same DNA molecule, which is freshly synthesized by the reverse transcriptase (RT). The detection and quantification of synthesized DNA as a parameter for RT activity follows a sandwich ELISA protocol. Biotin\u2010labelled DNA binds to the surface of microtitre plate modules that have been precoated with streptavidin. In the next step, an antibody to digoxigenin, conjugated to peroxidase, binds to the digoxigenin\u2010labelled DNA. In the final step, the peroxidase substrate is added. The peroxidase enzyme catalyzes the cleavage of the substrate, producing a coloured reaction product. The absorbance of the sample at 405 nm can be determined using a microtitre plate (ELISA) reader and is directly correlated to the level of RT activity. A fixed amount (4\u20136 ng) of recombinant HIV\u20101 reverse transcriptase was used. The inhibitory activity of the antifungal peptide was calculated as percent inhibition as compared to a control without the antifungal peptide (Wang and Ng 2002a, 2002b). Ascalin (Wang and Ng 2001) was used as a positive control.",

All reported values are the means of triplicate samples. Con A was used as a positive control and bovine serum albumin as a negative control (Wong and Ng 2003).",

            "text": "The crude extract was fractionated on Affi\u2010gel blue gel into a larger unadsorbed fraction (BG1) and a smaller adsorbed fraction (BG2) (Fig. 1a). Antifungal activity resided only in fraction BG2, which was then resolved on SP\u2010Sepharose into an unadsorbed fraction and three adsorbed fractions (SP1, SP2 and SP3) of similar size which were desorbed with 0\u00b72 mol l\u22121 NaCl, 0\u00b75 mol l\u22121 NaCl, and 1 mol l\u22121 NaCl, respectively (Fig. 1b). Antifungal activity was concentrated in fraction SP2. Fraction SP2 was separated on Mono S into a tiny unadsorbed fraction (S1) and two adsorbed fractions (S2 and S3) (Fig. 1c). Antifungal activity was detected only in the smaller adsorbed fraction S2. Final purification of S2 on Superdex Peptide resulted in a tiny peak and a major absorbance peak, the latter representing purified antifungal peptide (Fig. 1d) which showed a molecular mass of 5\u00b77 kDa in SDS\u2010PAGE (Fig. 2a). Its molecular mass as determined by mass spectrometry was 5716 Da (Fig. 2b). The yields of the chromatographic fractions with antifungal activity are presented in Table 1. It did not resemble previously reported Brassica peptides in N\u2010terminal sequence (Table 2). It lacked trypsin inhibitory activity toward BAEE when tested at an equimolar ratio to this substrate (Fig. 3) and was inactive on casein when tested up to 10 \u03bcmol l\u22121. The peptide exerted antifungal activity against various fungal species including Fusarium oxysporum (A), Helminthosporium maydis (B), Mycosphaerella arachidicola (C), and Valsa mali (D), with the ranking of potency being D>C>B>A. The IC50 values were respectively 3\u00b79 \u03bcmol l\u22121 (A), 4\u00b77 \u03bcmol l\u22121 (B), 2\u00b76 \u03bcmol l\u22121 (C), and 0\u00b722 \u03bcmol l\u22121 (D) (Fig. 4). The antifungal activity of the peptide was retained after exposure to various temperatures from 40\u00b0C to 100 \u00b0C (Fig. 5a), to the pH ranges 1\u20133 and 10\u201313 (Fig. 5b) and also after incubation with trypsin (not shown). It inhibited proliferation of HepG2 cells (Fig. 6a) and MCF7 cells (Fig. 6b), with an IC50 of 19\u00b72 and 4\u00b78 \u03bcmol l\u22121, respectively. It reduced the activity of HIV\u20101 reverse transcriptase with an IC50 of 17\u00b78 \u03bcmol l\u22121 (Fig. 6c). It was devoid of mitogenic activity (Fig. 6d).",

            "text": "An antifungal peptide, with a molecular mass of 9 kDa and resembling nonspecific lipid transfer proteins in N\u2010terminal sequence, has previously been isolated from Brassica campestris seeds (Lin et al. 2007). It constitutes the first report on the isolation of an antifungal peptide from the seeds of a Brassica species. The present findings furnish evidence for the presence of an antifungal peptide in another Brassica species. However, the N\u2010terminal sequences of the two Brassica antifungal peptides were different although both manifested remarkable thermostability and pH stability, HIV\u20101 reverse transcriptase inhibitory activity, and antiproliferative activity toward tumour cells. Both exerted antifungal activity toward F. oxysporum, M. arachidicola and a Helminthosporium species. This is noteworthy in view of the observation that some antifungal proteins exhibited antifungal activity toward only one fungus out of the several fungal species tested (Wang and Ng 2001, 2002a). Brassica parachinensis napin showed sequence similarity to Sinapis arvensis trypsin inhibitor and exhibited trypsin inhibitory activity. However, brassiparin did not resemble its homologous napin in N\u2010terminal sequence and exhibited no trypsin inhibitory activity. This is noteworthy in view of the fact that some of the trypsin inhibitors demonstrated antifungal activity (Ye et al. 2001). Both Brassica antifungal peptides were also isolated by using similar protocols. Ion exchange chromatography on Q\u2010Sepharose, affinity chromatography on Affi\u2010gel blue gel, ion exchange chromatography on Mono S, and gel filtration on Superdex Peptide were used for isolation of B. campestris antifungal peptide. The present protocol for brassiparin differed only in the replacement of Q\u2010Sepharose by SP\u2010Sepharose.",

Its HIV\u20101 reverse transcriptase inhibitory activity (IC50 = 17\u00b78 \u03bcmol l\u22121) was also lower than that of B. campestris antifungal peptide (IC50 = 4 \u03bcmol l\u22121), but more potent than many anti\u2010HIV\u20101 natural products (Ng et al. 1997). Similarly, its antiproliferative activity toward HepG2 cells and MCF\u20107 cells (IC50 = 19\u00b72 and 4\u00b78 \u03bcmol l\u22121, respectively) was lower than that of B. campestris antifungal peptide (IC50 = 5\u00b78 and 1\u00b76 \u03bcmol l\u22121, respectively). Antifungal peptides from both B. parachinensis peptide and B. campestris were devoid of mitogenic activity toward mouse splenocytes. It has previously been shown that some (Ye et al. 2001; Wang and Ng 2003; Chu and Ng 2004) but not other (Lin et al. 2007) antifungal proteins/peptides exhibited mitogenic activity. Both brassiparin and B. campestris antifungal peptide had no inhibitory effect on HIV\u20101 integrase, unlike some other antifungal proteins (Ng et al. 2003). They were also inactive toward SARS coronavirus proteinase. Frech bean defensin\u2010like antifungal peptide resembled the two Brassica antifungal peptides in that it did not have any suppressive effect on HIV\u20101 integrase and SARS proteinase (Leung et al. 2008).",
