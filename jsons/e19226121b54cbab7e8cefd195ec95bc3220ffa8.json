These proteins are ubiquitin-like proteins that become directly conjugated to a lipid in the autophagy membrane upon induction of autophagy, thus providing a marker of the pathway, allowing studies of autophagosome biogenesis and maturation. Moreover, the ATG8 proteins function to recruit components of the core autophagy machinery as well as cargo for selective degradation. Importantly, comprehensive structural and biochemical in vitro studies of the machinery required for ATG8 protein lipidation, as well as their genetic manipulation in various model organisms, have provided novel insight into the molecular mechanisms and pathophysiological roles of the mATG8 proteins. Recently, it has become evident that the ATG8 proteins and their conjugation machinery are also involved in intracellular pathways and processes not related to autophagy. This review focuses on the molecular functions of ATG8 proteins and their conjugation machinery in autophagy and other pathways, as well as their links to disease.",

            "text": "Autophagy is crucial for the normal development of cells and organs, and its malfunction is linked to several human diseases. Macroautophagy (hereafter referred to as autophagy) is tightly regulated by several evolutionary conserved autophagy-related (ATG) proteins and involves sequestration of cytoplasmic material into a double-membrane autophagosome that fuses with the lysosome to allow cargo degradation (Figure 1 ). Autophagy is crucial for cell survival upon metabolic stress and for cell homeostasis by removal of dangerous cellular components, including dysfunctional organelles, intracellular microbes, and pathogenic proteins [1, 2] . Overview of conventional and several non-conventional pathways where autophagy-related (ATG)8 proteins and their conjugation machinery are utilized. Briefly, ATG8 protein conjugation is important during macroautophagy where it facilitates cargo recruitment, closure of the autophagosome and degradation of the inner membrane. ATG8 proteins and their machinery are also shown to affect protein secretion, including regulated secretion (Lysozyme, Glut4), Golgi-bypass secretion (CFTR), and secretory autophagy, which includes secretion of cytosolic interleukin 1 beta (IL-1\u03b2) and insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE). ATG8 proteins are found to be important for maturation of compartments following light chain 3 (LC3)-associated phagocytosis (LAP), entosis, micropinocytosis, and LC3-associated endocytosis (LANDO). Core components of the conjugation machinery have further been implicated in endosomal microautophagy and exosome release.",

In contrast, the ATG8 proteins become directly conjugated to the lipid phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) in the autophagic membranes and remain bound throughout the pathway [6, 7] . ATG8 proteins have therefore been the most widely used markers to study autophagosome biogenesis and trafficking [8] . Several studies have also addressed the cellular and pathophysiological importance of mATG8 conjugation to autophagy membranes. Pioneer studies in mice lacking ATG8 conjugation machinery components show that mATG8 lipidation, and autophagy, is important for neonatal survival and that tissue-specific knock-out (KO) of components of the conjugation machinery in adult mice can cause disease, including cancer and neurodegeneration, the latter caused by accumulation of protein aggregates in the mouse brain [9, 10] . The main function of LC3 and GABARAP proteins in autophagy seems to be recruitment and scaffolding of proteins containing a so-called LC3-interacting region (LIR) (referred to as Atg8 Interaction Motif (AIM) in yeast). Some LIR-containing proteins facilitate autophagosome biogenesis (e.g., members of the ULK1 complex), while other LIR-containing proteins function as cargo-receptors to mediate specific targeting of cargo during selective autophagy [11] . Recently, it has however become evident that LC3/GABARAP proteins and members of their conjugation machinery also play a role in other membrane trafficking and signaling pathways. In this review we will discuss the role of mATG8 family members and their conjugation machinery in autophagy and other cellular pathways, as well as their roles in health and disease.",

            "text": "While there is only one Atg8 protein in yeast, the human ATG8 proteins are encoded by seven genes grouped into the LC3 (LC3A, LC3B, LC3B2, and LC3C) and GABARAP (GABARAP, GABARAPL1, GABARAPL2 (also called GATE-16)) subfamilies. While some animal lineages have lost members of the ATG8 family, many plants have gained genes encoding ATG8 proteins and can express more than ten different ATG8 proteins [12] . ATG8 proteins are members of the family of small ubiquitin-like modifier (UBL) proteins and contain in addition to the common ubiquitin-like fold two extra N-terminal \u03b1-helices [13, 14] . The ATG8 proteins become covalently conjugated to the lipid phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) in a process that involves members of the ATG4 cysteine protease family and two ubiquitin-like conjugations systems that together regulate the three stages of LC3/GABARAP membrane conjugation; priming, PE-conjugation and de-lipidation (described in detail below and in Figure 2A Mechanisms and interactions (protein and membrane) of core autophagy components required for priming, lipidation and de-lipidation of ATG8 proteins during starvation-induced autophagy are illustrated. The illustration also includes the conjugation of ATG12 to ATG5 as well as the less commonly reported conjugation of ATG12 to ATG3 (shaded), which serves its purpose outside of autophagy. Key interactions are numbered and shown in greater detail in (B). (B) ATG3 interacts with ATG7 and ATG12 through motifs located in a flexible region (aa , these motifs are referred to as RIA7 (1) and RIA12 (2) respectively. An amphipathic helix in the very N-terminal end of ATG3 (aa 1-26) provides membrane binding essential for lipidation of ATG8 proteins (6) . G140 of ATG12 is conjugated to K130 of ATG5 (3) or K243 of ATG3 (10) . It is proposed that V62 and W139 of ATG12 (5) serves as a LIR motif to secure the complex to the membrane of an autophagosome during lipidation. ATG16L1 interacts with ATG5 through its N-terminal helix (aa 13-28) (4) . Membrane interaction of ATG16L1 is achieved through multiple interactions; an amphipathic helix near the N-terminal end provide membrane binding and is required for ATG8 lipidation (7) , conserved residues in the coiled-coil domain together with its interaction with the phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PtdIns(3)P) effector protein WIPI2 (8) provide binding to PtdIns(3)P and membrane binding through the \u03b2-isoform specific insert is important for ATG8 protein lipidation to damaged endosomes/lysosomes. The \u03b2-isoform specific insert is a highly post-translationally modified area in ATG16L1 and includes a confirmed phosphorylation site for ULK1 on S278. ATG4B interacts with ATG8 proteins through its catalytic core (CC) and an N-terminal and a C-terminal LC3-interacting region (LIR) (9).",

The processed forms of LC3/GABARAP proteins are referred to as LC3-I/GABARAP-I, while the PE-conjugated proteins are termed LC3-II/GABARAP-II (Figure 2A ). There are four human ATG4 proteins (ATG4A, ATG4B, ATG4C, ATG4D) all shown to be able to cleave LC3/GABARAP proteins, but with different specificity towards the various LC3 and GABARAP family members as well as their presence as soluble or conjugated proteins [15, [17] [18] [19] [20] (Table 1) . ATG4A and ATG4B have the closest pair-wise sequence identity and seem to facilitate both priming and de-lipidation of LC3 and GABARAP proteins. In contrast, ATG4C and ATG4D, which are more similar to each other than to ATG4A/B, appear to be specific for the de-lipidation of LC3/GABARAP proteins (described below) [18, 19] . Rescue of mutant yeast strains lacking Atg4 by human ATG4 indicate that ATG4-mediated processing of ATG8 is evolutionarily conserved [18] . It is also interesting to note that unprocessed forms of mammalian and yeast ATG8 proteins normally do not accumulate even when ATG4 levels are diminished by protein knockdown or drug treatment [21, 22] , indicating that this step is tightly regulated. Further studies are however needed to unravel the mechanisms underlying such regulation of LC3 and GABARAP protein levels. ",

The C-terminal domain of ATG7 is responsible for adenylation of the substrate (LC3/GABARAP or ATG12) by activating the C-terminal glycine of its substrate using ATP. This is followed by covalent attachment of the activated glycine residue to a catalytic cysteine residue in the ATG7 C-terminal through a thioester bond [32] ( Figure 2A , Table 1 ). Finally, ATG7 promotes transfer of ATG8/ATG12 to the catalytic cysteine of the E2 conjugating enzymes ATG3 and ATG10, respectively. For yeast Atg7 it is shown that the protein forms a gliding bird-shaped dimeric architecture, through the dimerization of its C-terminal domain and further interaction of its N-terminal domain with either Atg3 or Atg10 [52] [53] [54] [55] [56] . Interestingly, Atg3 binds to one Atg7 and receives Atg8 from the catalytic cysteine of the opposite Atg7 molecule in the homodimer [53] [54] [55] [56] . In the case of LC3 and GABARAP proteins the catalytic cysteine residue of the E2 enzyme ATG3 replaces that of ATG7, resulting in the transfer of LC3/GABARAP onto ATG3 via a trans-thioesterification reaction [24, 27] , while the E2 enzyme ATG10 has a similar role for ATG12 [57] ( Figure 2A ).",

The ATG3 FR contains a region responsible for interaction with ATG7 (region interacting with ATG7 (RIA7), aa~157-181) [23], as well as a region interacting with ATG12 (RIA12, aa~140-170) [25] (Figure 2A ,B-1,B-2, Table 1 ). As these regions of interaction overlap at aa 157-170 it is not surprising that the E1-E2 (ATG7/ATG3) and E2-E3 (ATG3/ATG12-ATG5-ATG16L1) interactions are mutually exclusive [23, 59] . Mutation of RIA7, required for the E1-E2 interaction, was found to severely impact GABARAP-loading of ATG3 [23], while RIA12 is crucial for recruitment of ATG12 and LC3B-II production [25] . Interestingly, the interaction between ATG12 and ATG3-RIA12 is structurally similar to the interaction of ATG8 family proteins with proteins containing a LIR motif [25] . As neither study included both LC3 and GABARAP proteins, it is likely that RIA7 and RIA12 are equally important for lipidation of both LC3 and GABARAP proteins. Importantly, the overlapping region favors interaction with the E3 complex [23], implying that the flow of the reaction cascade is biased towards the PE conjugation.",

An N-terminal amphipathic helix in yeast Atg3 has also been proposed to be important for binding of Atg8 to PE containing membranes [60] . Additionally, positive interfacial lysine residues (located between the hydrophobic and polar face of the ATG3 amphipathic helix) provides affinity for negatively charged membranes [61] . Interestingly, in yeast it was found that acetylation of the N-terminal region of Atg3 promotes its Atg8 interaction and lipidation of Atg8 [62] . This was followed up in a later study where it was demonstrated that acetylation of Atg3 K19/K48 increases its interaction to PE-containing liposomes [63] . Whether a similar modification or other post-translation modifications also regulates the membrane binding affinity of human ATG3 remains to be seen. However, while the N-terminal amphipathic helix of ATG3 is required for LC3/GABARAP lipidation, in vitro and in vivo LC3/GABARAP lipidation experiments show that it is not sufficient for LC3/GABARAP lipidation in the absence of the ATG12-ATG5-ATG16L1 E3 complex [39] .",

            "text": "Interestingly, the amphipathic helix of ATG3 is proposed to serve a curvature sensing function, as its membrane binding requires extensive lipid-packaging defects [28] . Thus, it is tempting to speculate that ATG3 facilitates ATG8 lipidation specifically at highly curved membranes, as seen at the limiting edge of the growing phagophore. As ATG8 proteins must be removed from the outer membrane before the final maturation of the organelle [28, 64] , continued lipidation on the autophagosome itself would be non-productive. The discovery that mATG8 proteins also can be conjugated to single membrane compartments with low curvature, does however indicate that ATG8 lipidation is tightly regulated through various mechanisms. ATG3 is cleaved by caspase-8 in response to treatment with the death ligands Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1) or Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), generating degradation products that are rapidly degraded by the proteasome [29] . Interestingly, the caspase-8 cleavage site (LETD, aa [166] [167] [168] [169] overlaps with the ATG7 and ATG12 interacting region, suggesting that caspase-8-mediated processing of ATG3 is an efficient way of turning off autophagy under such pro-apoptotic conditions. Moreover, phosphorylation of ATG3 by protein tyrosine kinase 2 (PTK2) on Tyr203 upon DNA-damage inducing treatments was found to promote rapid degradation of ATG3 via an ubiquitin-proteasome-dependent pathway [65] . Prevention of ATG3 degradation during the DNA damaging process, lead to a significant decrease in cell proliferation in a mitotic catastrophe-dependent manner [65] . Thus, downregulation of ATG3 levels by posttranslational modifications and caspase cleavage under various conditions leading to cell death indicates that ATG3 is an important point for direct regulation of LC3/GABARAP lipidation and autophagy.",

These show that ATG16L1 interacts with a surface of ATG5, consisting of two ubiquitin-like fold domains (referred to as UFD-1 and UFD-2), in an \u03b1-helical conformation with a slight kink in the middle [31] (Figure 2A ,B-4). ATG12 binds to the opposite side of ATG5 compared to ATG16L1 , and no contacts between ATG12 and ATG16L1 are seen [31] . The interaction between ATG5 and ATG16L1 is mainly mediated by the ATG5 (Five)-Interacting Motif (AFIM) in ATG16L1 stretching from aa 13-28, although the remaining part of the helix also seems to contribute to its interaction with ATG5 ( Figure 2B -4, Table 1 ). The C-terminal portion of ATG16L1 1-69 contains several hydrophobic residues situated toward the interface with ATG5, such as F32, I36, T39, and L43 and it was found that these hydrophobic amino acids allow formation of a crystallographic homodimer [34] . The formation of a dimer in solution was further verified by size exclusion chromatography plus multi-angle light scattering (SEC-MALS) analysis of ATG5-ATG16L1 1-69 . Thus, the N-terminal helix of human ATG16L1 is both sufficient for interaction with ATG5 and for self-dimerization, even without the middle coiled-coil region.",

This membrane interaction is not required for recruitment of the E3 ligase complex to membranes in vivo, but is essential for efficient LC3/GABARAP lipidation both in vitro and in vivo. Thus, it is likely that membrane binding by ATG16L1 helix 2 positions and stabilizes the other members of the conjugation machinery in close proximity to the membrane surface to allow lipidation to occur. This could be facilitated by the combined membrane binding affinity of the ATG3 and ATG16L1 amphipathic helices or by the assembly of oligomeric ATG12-ATG5-ATG16L1 structures, which upon membrane insertion of helix 2 could cause membrane deformations so that ATG3 can insert its amphipathic helix.",

The coiled-coil domain of ATG16L1 (aa 78-230) provides dimerization of the full length protein [76] , and harbor a binding site for Ras-related protein Rab-33B (RAB33b, aa 200-265) [78] as well as residues (I171, K179, and R193) that seem to be important for recruitment of PtdIns(3)P containing liposomes to ATG16L1-coated beads ( Figure 2B -8, Table 1 ) [40] . The linker region connecting the coiled-coil domain to the C-terminal WD40 repeats defines the difference between the two isoforms of ATG16L1 found in humans, the \u03b1 and \u03b2 isoform. The \u03b1 isoform lacks an exon compared to the \u03b2 isoform and are thus missing aa 266-284 of the \u03b2 isoform. Also, a \u03b3 isoform has been found in mice, having a 16 amino acid insert after aa 284 of ATG16L1 \u03b2. Interestingly, the \u03b2 isoform specific region (aa 266-284) is highly phosphorylated (phosphosite), where S278 has been verified as a substrate for the ULK1 kinase in response to infection or starvation [79] ( Figure 2B ). Moreover, this region was shown to bind membrane in vitro and to be important for localization of ATG16L1\u03b2 to swollen endosomes in cells [39] .",

It has been proposed that an elevated level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is needed to facilitate the productive assembly of autophagosomes by suppressing ATG8 de-lipidation at the autophagosome assembly site. Indeed, it was shown that antioxidants prevent localization of ATG8 proteins to autophagic membranes, which may indicate that ROS, especially H 2 O 2 that accumulate in cells during starvation, are required for autophagy [86] . In line with this model, ATG4A and ATG4B contain oxidation-prone cysteine residues in their active sites, which render these proteins sensitive to ROS [86] . Oxidative stress can also cause direct oxidation of ATG3 and ATG7, which was found to inhibit their activity in LC3 lipidation [87] .",

Thus, insight into how membrane conjugated LC3 and GABARAP proteins persist long enough to support autophagosome maturation when ATG4 activity is otherwise normal has been an area of intense investigation. Recent studies have identified conserved C-terminal LIR motifs in all ATG4 family members. In addition, ATG4B has a conserved N-terminal LIR that engages a non-substrate LC3 protein in the co-crystal of the protease and substrate [47] ( Table 1 ). The C-terminal LIR of ATG4B was found to have two roles; 1) to stabilize the pool of soluble GABARAP-family proteins by preventing their degradation by an autophagy-independent turnover pathway and 2) to support de-lipidation, as demonstrated for de-lipidation of GABARAPL1-PE (reduced by a factor of~4) and LC3B-PE (completely abolished) [19, 42] . Mutation of the ATG4B C-terminal LIR did however not affect priming of LC3/GABARAP proteins, The N-terminal LIR of ATG4B had no effect on priming and only a modest effect on de-lipidation with a 2-fold reduction on LC3B-PE and insignificant effect on GABARAPL1-PE [19].",

In the absence of other specific autophagy markers, it has been difficult to investigate the pathway and many studies have concluded about autophagy levels based on the levels of membrane conjugated LC3 observed. Such conclusions are likely valid in most cases, but several new discoveries in the field indicate that LC3 should not be used as a general indicator of autophagy. Most importantly, recent studies have found that autophagosomes can still form in cells depleted of components of the LC3 conjugation machinery (such as ATG3, ATG5 or ATG7) [92] or of all LC3 isoforms (LC3A/B/C) [93, 94] . Moreover, LC3 positive structures may not be autophagosomes. As LC3 interacts with ubiquitin-binding autophagy receptors (e.g., p62), it will be recruited to protein aggregates accumulating in cells with compromised autophagy [8, 95] . Another potential pitfall by using LC3 as a marker for autophagy, is the recently recognized conjugation of LC3 to membranes not involved in autophagy, including phagosomes and perturbed endosomes (described in more detail below). Thus, although LC3 is still our best marker for autophagy, it is important to include proper controls when using it.",

Importantly, STX17 localizes to the outer membrane of completed autophagosomes through a unique C-terminal hairpin structure, providing an explanation as to why the lysosome does not fuse with early autophagy structures, but also an alternative marker to study autophagosome formation. Interestingly, only two minutes after recruitment of STX17, small lysosomes start to fuse with the autophagosomes, which become lysotracker positive, suggesting acidification of the space between the inner and outer autophagosomal membrane. Approximately seven minutes later the autophagosomal matrix was entirely acidified, suggesting that the inner autophagosomal membrane is degraded [92] . When analyzing STX17-positive autophagosome biogenesis in ATG conjugation-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), it was found that autophagosome-like structures that were able to fuse with lysosomes formed, although at a reduced rate, but that degradation of the inner autophagosomal membrane was significantly delayed and by extension also cargo degradation [92] . Thus, the conjugation machinery, and by extension LC3 and GABARAP proteins, are likely important for efficient closure of the phagophore by fission of the inner and outer autophagosomal membrane of the phagophore edge.",

While depletion of all LC3s had no effect on starvation-induced autophagic flux, this was inhibited by depletion of all GABARAPs [93, 94] . The mechanistic explanation for this is not clear, but it is interesting to note that several LIR-containing proteins are specific GABARAP interactors [100] . Among those are the ULK1 kinase and ATG13, a member of the ULK1 complex, and it was found that the LIR motif is required for starvation-induced association of ULK1 with autophagosomes [101] . Interestingly, a recent paper identified GABARAP and GABARAPL1 as positive regulators of ULK1 activity and phagophore formation in response to starvation, while LC3B and LC3C was found to negatively regulate ULK1 activity and phagophore formation [102] .",

ATG2 is a lipid transfer protein that seem to tether the tip of the expanding phagophore with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to facilitate lipid transfer and autophagosome biogenesis [107] [108] [109] . Recruitment of Atg2/ATG2B and its binding partner Atg18/WIPI4 to the phagophore was found to require Atg9 [110] and Trafficking protein particle complex subunit 11 (TRAPPC11) and depletion of TRAPPC11 phenocopied that of ATG2 deletion [111] . The endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT) III components are also necessary for autophagosome closure [112, 113] , but their link if any to GABARAP has not been revealed. LC3 and GABARAP proteins have also been reported to possess membrane tethering and fusogenic properties [98, 114, 115] . Whether this is a function required for fission of the phagophore membrane is still not clear, but it has been proposed that GABARAP proteins could bridge some portion of the fission pore to facilitate organelle closure. Consistent with such an idea it was shown that lipidated GABARAPL1 accumulate at sites of high curvature and membrane-membrane apposition, making the open fission pore of a forming autophagosome an ideal site of function [115] .",

Although autophagy receptors were originally identified as cytosolic proteins, such as p62, Next to BRCA1 gene 1 protein (NBR1) or Nuclear dot protein 52 (NDP52) binding to ubiquitinated cargo, it was later found that cargo-specific membrane-bound proteins also can function as autophagy receptors, including proteins in mitochondria (BCL2/adenovirus E1B 19 kDa protein-interacting protein 3 (BNIP3), BCL2/adenovirus E1B 19 kDa protein-interacting protein 3-like (BNIP3L) and FUN14 domain-containing protein 1 (FUNDC1)) [122] and the ER (Family with sequence similarity 134 member B (FAM134b), Reticulon-3 (RTN3), cell-cycle progression gene 1 (CCPG1) and Testis-expressed protein 264 (TEX264)) [127] .

A landmark study from 2010 identified the interactome of all LC3 and GABARAP proteins, which was found to comprise 67 proteins [128] . Many of these proteins have later been found to contain a LIR, which is typically composed of a core W/F/Y-x 1 -x 2 -L/V/I motif, where the respective aromatic and hydrophobic amino acids interact with two hydrophobic pockets on the LC3/GABARAP proteins [11, 129] . Many proteins have acidic residues N-terminal to the core motif, which seem to increase the affinity of their interaction with LC3/GABARAP [11] . Interestingly, not all LIR motifs contain acidic residues at the start, and it has been found that many LIRs instead have a phosphorylatable residue upstream of the core LIR residues that upon phosphorylation introduces a negative charge akin to an acidic residue that can enhance binding to the basic (R10/R11/K51) patch in LC3 [130] . This was first revealed for the receptor protein optineurin (OPTN) that becomes phosphorylated by the kinase TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) in response to cellular Salmonella infection and it was shown that preventing this phosphorylation reduced the efficiency of LC3 targeting to invading bacteria [131, 132] . The concept of LIR phosphorylation has also been observed with the mitophagy receptors BNIP3L, FUNDC1 and BNIP3 [133] [134] [135] [136] . BNIP3L contains two serine residues upstream of the LIR motif (NSSWVEL), which when phosphorylated enhances LC3B binding affinity up to 100-fold [133] .",

Interestingly, most autophagy receptors possess an LIR motif which allows their direct binding to LC3. In contrast, most autophagy adaptor proteins, which are important for autophagy, but not degraded by autophagy, have GABARAP-specific LIRs. Thus, LC3 proteins are believed to be particularly important for recruitment of cargo upon selective autophagy. To be able to further analyze the localization and function of the different endogenous LC3/GABARAP proteins, specific fluorescence-based ATG8 sensors have been developed [137, 138] . Such sensors are based on the different LIR-peptide specificities of the various LC3 and GABARAP proteins and will likely provide novel insight into the cellular localization of these proteins.",

            "text": "The simple linear model of selective autophagy, in which cargo-specific receptors facilitate recruitment of LC3-containing phagophores to facilitate sequestration of the cargo into autophagosomes, has recently been challenged by several elegant studies showing that receptor proteins, as p62 and NDP52, rather recruit the ULK1 complex to initiate de novo phagophore formation directly at the cargo, independently of LC3 [139] [140] [141] . p62 and NDP52 were found to interact directly with the ULK1 complex subunit FIP200 to facilitate cargo-recruitment of the ULK1 complex, which again led to recruitment of other core ATG proteins and de novo phagophore formation. This binding seems to be regulated by phosphorylation of the receptors, TBK1 in the case of NDP52 [140, 141] . Interestingly, the interaction of p62 with FIP200 was outcompeted by LC3B [139] , suggesting a sequential and directional order of p62 binding partners during phagophore formation in selective autophagy. In line with such a de novo model of phagophore formation, LC3/GABARAP proteins were found to be recruited to damaged mitochondria independent of their binding to autophagy receptors further facilitating ubiquitin-independent recruitment of OPTN and NDP52 to growing phagophore membranes via the LIR motif, which again would amplify PTEN-induced putative kinase protein 1 (PINK1)/PRKN-dependent mitophagy [142] . Thus, de novo building of the phagophore around a specific cargo seems to involve an intricate and highly regulated network of protein interactions, including a LC3/GABARAP-dependent positive feedback loop. It still remains elusive where the lipids/membranes for such cargo-specific phagophore formation come from and whether the mechanisms of phagophore formation differ from starvation-induced autophagy. The origin of the phagophore membrane and the mechanisms involved in autophagosome biogenesis have been extensively described in several other review articles (for recent reviews see e.g., [5, 143] ) and will not be further discussed here.",

Recently, it was shown that TBK1 also phosphorylates several LC3 and GABARAP subfamily proteins, except LC3B and GABARAP, and further investigation revealed that TBK1 indeed can regulate autophagy by phosphorylating LC3C on S93 and S96 and GABARAPL2 on S87 and S88 [46] . These phosphorylation events impede de-lipidation of LC3C and GABARAPL2 by ATG4A and ATG4B, thus protecting them from premature removal from forming autophagosomes [46] .

The PtdIns(3)P in turn was produced by the PI3KC3 complex II, containing UV radiation resistance-associated gene protein (UVRAG) and Rubicon, but not ATG14L and Activating molecule in BECN1-regulated autophagy protein 1 (AMBRA1) [148] . The question then is how do ROS cause LC3 lipidation during LAP?

It is proposed that the V-ATPase complex actually detects damage to membrane compartments by sensing changes in the proton gradient, triggering a conformational change, which results in recruitment of the conjugation machinery to promote LC3/GABARAP lipidation at the perturbed membrane. Indeed, it was recently shown that the WD domain of ATG16L1 facilitates an interaction with the V-ATPase upon bacteria-induced vacuolar membrane damage in Salmonella infected cells, leading to LC3 lipidation on the Salmonella containing vacuole (SCV) and a reduction in the bacterial burden [159] .",

Upon Salmonella typhimurium infection, lysozyme secretion become resistant to Brefeldin A treatment, suggesting it by-passes ER to Golgi transport [164] (Figure 1) . Importantly, these Golgi independent secretory lysozyme granules become surrounded by a LC3 positive double membrane. Moreover, secretion of lysozyme becomes sensitive to mutations in ATG16L1 and to treatment with the autophagy inhibitor 3-methyl adenine (3-MA), corroborating the importance of the autophagy machinery in this non-conventional secretory pathway. Interestingly, autophagy-dependent secretion of lysozyme does not involve lysosomal degradation, as treatment with chloroquine, which disrupts lysosomal acidification, has no effect on lysozyme secretion.",

            "text": "Secretion of leaderless cytoplasmic proteins is often referred to as secretory autophagy as it utilizes autophagic core components (Figure 1 ). Substrates include IL-1\u03b2 [165] [166] [167] , high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) protein [165, 168] and insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) [169] . IDE is one of the major proteases of amyloid beta peptide (A\u03b2), presumed to be a causative molecule in Alzheimer disease (AD) pathogenesis. Experiments with astrocytes, the main IDE secreting cells, showed that IDE secretion upon stimulation with amyloid beta peptide required the activity of ATG5, RAB8A, and Golgi reassembly stacking protein (GORASP). Additionally, autophagic inhibitors like 3-MA reduced secretion, while rapamycin, an inducer of autophagy, promoted secretion. Secretion of IL-1\u03b2, particularly that from non-immune cells, was found to occur through a similar pathway that required ATG5, ATG16L1, LC3B, GABARAP, Golgi reassembly-stacking proteins (GRASPs), and RAB8A with IL-1\u03b2 found in LC3-positive structures [165] [166] [167] 170] . The similar requirements found for secretion of these substrates argues for a common pathway that uses an \"autophagosome-like\" intermediate. However, IL-1\u03b2 can also be secreted through Gasdermin D (GSDMD) pores in the plasma membrane [171] [172] [173] . GSDMD is processed by caspase during inflammation, generating a truncated product that is efficiently recruited to the plasma membrane where it can form a 16-fold-symmetry pore that allows secretion of IL-1\u03b2 [171, 173] . Recently it was also shown that IL-1\u03b2 accumulates at PtdIns(4,5)P 2 -enriched plasma membrane ruffles, further indicating that IL-1\u03b2 can be secreted both through GSDMD-dependent and -independent pathways [174] .",

            "text": "Recently, a starvation-induced response referred to as endosomal microautophagy was found to cause the rapid degradation of selected proteins, including autophagy receptors. This pathway involved sorting of autophagy receptors into the intra-luminal vesicles of MVBs in a process that required the activity of the ESCRT-III component Charged multivesicular body protein 4b (CHMP4B) and the AAA ATPase VPS4, but seemed independent of VPS34 and the ULK1 complex [176] . Surprisingly, while ATG7 and ATG5 were dispensable for degradation of NBR1, Tax1-binding protein 1 (TAX1BP1), and Nuclear receptor coactivator 4 (NCOA4) through this pathway, endosomal microautophagy of p62 and NDP52 relied on ATG7/ATG5 as well as the LIR motif of p62, suggesting their binding to lipidated ATG8s [176] . It is tempting to propose that the rapid degradation of autophagy receptors by starvation-induced endosomal microautophagy prevents excessive and harmful selective macroautophagy under such acute conditions. Endosomal microautophagy was also reported in Drosophila melanogaster (fruit flies), but in contrast to the process described above it is initiated after prolonged starvation and targets substrates with a KFERQ motif in a Heat shock 70 kDa protein cognate 4 (Hsc70-4) dependent manner [177] . This process also requires MVB formation and ESCRT components, but proceeds independently of Atg5, Atg7 and Atg1 [177] .",

It was found that non-lipidated LC3 associates with ERAD tuning vesicles/EDEMosomes, which are ER derived vesicles that mediate clearance of ERAD regulators from the ER, including ER degradation-enhancing \u03b1-mannosidase-like 1 (EDEM1) and osteosarcoma amplified 9 (OS9) [179, 180] . The role of LC3-I on EDEMosomes is still unclear, however it was found that Coronaviruses (CoVs) can hijack these vesicles for viral replication and that this requires LC3-I [180, 181] . LC3 depletion inhibited replication of the CoVs Mouse Hepatitis Virus (MHV) and the equine arteritis virus (EAV), which could readily be reverted by re-introducing non-lipidatable LC3 to the cells. Moreover, Atg7 was dispensable for viral replication, further confirming a role of non-lipidated LC3 in EDEMosome-based viral replication.",

This was initially interpreted as autophagy being dispensable for normal development, but it was later shown that autophagy plays a critical role in newly fertilized oocytes [184] . It was demonstrated that oocytes derived from oocyte-specific ATG5 knockout mice failed to develop beyond the eight-cell stage when they were fertilized by ATG5-deficient sperm, but developed normally when fertilized by wild type sperm. Preimplantation autophagy seems to be important to support a normal rate of protein synthesis, but it could also be important for degradation of specific proteins or organelles at this stage.

In contrast to the ATG12-ATG3 conjugate, required for budding of intraluminal vesicles into MVBs [73] , ATG5 did not affect MVB formation. Rather, ATG5 was found to regulate sorting of the V-ATPase subunit ATP6V1E1 into the intraluminal vesicles along with LC3, thereby decreasing the acidification of MVB, which promoted exosome release [197] . While LC3-II was detected within exosomes in wild type cells, LC3-I was found in exosomes in ATG7 deficient cells and LC3 was absent from exosomes in ATG5 and ATG16L1 cells, indicating that LC3 lipidation is not a prerequisite for LC3 sorting into exosomes.",

The WD domain-containing C-terminus of ATG16L1 is dispensable for canonical autophagy [209] and in line with this, it was found that mice lacking this part of Atg16L1 were capable of activating autophagy, but unable to activate LAP [210] . These mice grew at the same rate as littermate controls, were fertile and did not have obvious defects in liver, kidney, brain or muscle homeostasis, indicating that autophagy maintains tissue homeostasis in mice independently of LAP [210] . In contrast, when the WIPI2 binding site (E226 and E230) was also deleted (in addition to the C-terminal WD repeats) the mice appeared defective in both autophagy and LAP in all tissues, and although they survived post-natal starvation, they were smaller and died around six months of age. Thus, systemic deletion of conjugation machinery genes is more severe than deletion of the ATG16L1 [210] . The LAP-deficient mice displayed a significant incapacity of bone marrow derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) to present exogenous antigens compared to wild-type BMDCs [41] . The mechanisms underlying the role of the ATG16L1 WD domain in LAP remains elusive, but might be linked to the reported binding of the WD domain of ATG16L1 to Nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing protein (NOD)-like receptors [211] , Mediterranean fever (MEFV)/Tripartite motif (TRIM)-containing protein 20 (TRIM20) [212] , Transmembrane protein 59 (TMEM59) [213] and Protein eva-1 homolog A (EVA1A)/TMEM166 [214] .",

The intracellular pathogen Legionella pneumophila interferes with autophagy by expressing the bacterial effector protein RavZ, which directly deconjugates lipidated LC3 and GABARAP proteins [221] . RavZ cleaves N-terminal of the carboxyl-terminal glycine residue, generating non-lipidatable LC3/GABARAP proteins and a novel PE substrate with a glycine modification. The truncated LC3/GABARAP proteins cannot be further processed by ATG7 and ATG3, thereby irreversibly inactivating them during infection [221] .",

            "text": "While autophagy plays an important anti-viral function, several viruses successfully avoid autophagy and even hijack the autophagy machinery for their own replication. Influenza A virus hijacks autophagy via interaction of a LIR in the cytoplasmic tail of its M2 proton channel with LC3, promoting LC3 localization to the plasma membrane [222] . Mutations in the M2 LIR motif interfere with filamentous budding and reduce virion stability. Moreover, LC3 relocalization depends on the proton channel activity of M2 and the WD domain of ATG16L1, suggesting that the LC3 lipidation could be triggered by loss of cellular pH gradients. Thus, hijacking autophagy probably facilitates transmission of Influenza A virus infection between organisms by enhancing the stability of viral progeny.",

            "text": "The ATG8 proteins have been widely used as markers to study autophagy for two decades and have been imperative for our understanding of mechanisms involved in regulation and execution of the pathway. However, their exact function in autophagy are only starting to become clear. We know that although autophagosomes can form in the absence of lipidated ATG8 proteins, GABARAP proteins seems to be particularly important for membrane recruitment of core autophagy machinery and for autophagosome closure, while LC3 proteins may be specifically involved in cargo recruitment. Several structure-function studies have provided important information about how such specificity is obtained by binding of LC3 and GABARAP proteins to proteins containing specific LIR motifs. However, the molecular mechanisms involved in regulation of the localization and function of the different LC3 and GABARAP proteins in time and space in vivo still remains largely unknown. It is also not clear to what degree the LC3 and GABARAP subfamilies have specific and/or redundant roles in autophagy. Another open question is whether the role of LC3/GABARAP proteins in autophagosome biogenesis differ depending on the autophagy-inducing signal and the presence of cargo or not. Finally, we are only beginning to understand the non-conventional roles of LC3 and GABARAP proteins in pathways not related to autophagy. Clearly, the latter will be an important field of research within the near future, but it is also important that autophagy researchers keep this in mind when targeting ATG8 proteins or their conjugation machinery.",

Briefly, ATG8 protein conjugation is important during macroautophagy where it facilitates cargo recruitment, closure of the autophagosome and degradation of the inner membrane. ATG8 proteins and their machinery are also shown to affect protein secretion, including regulated secretion (Lysozyme, Glut4), Golgi-bypass secretion (CFTR), and secretory autophagy, which includes secretion of cytosolic interleukin 1 beta (IL-1\u03b2) and insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE). ATG8 proteins are found to be important for maturation of compartments following light chain 3 (LC3)-associated phagocytosis (LAP), entosis, micropinocytosis, and LC3-associated endocytosis (LANDO). Core components of the conjugation machinery have further been implicated in endosomal microautophagy and exosome release.",
