As the members of the family of coronaviridae, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus1 and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus,2 have caused more than 10,000 cumulative cases in the past two decades. Also, 2019-nCoV has led to more than 80,000 patients of novel coronavirus pneumonia and nearly 3000 deaths in the world, mainly in Hubei province of China. Health care workers and the public are facing an unprecedented challenge in prevention of these viral infections and cross infections. Considering the most common symptom of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is fever, and many kinds of skin diseases are also accompanied by fever, properly carrying out pre-examination and triage for patients with skin lesions and fever has been a practical problem encountered in the hospitals for skin diseases and dermatology clinics in general hospitals. The Chinese Society of Dermatology organized experts to formulate the principles and procedures for pre-examination and triage of visitors to clinic of dermatology during outbreak of the 2019 novel coronavirus infection, so as to properly deal with the visitors to clinics of dermatology.",
