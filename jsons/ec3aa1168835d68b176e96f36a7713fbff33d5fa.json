The induction periods may be very short (e.g. is a migraine attack triggered by a given nutritional component?) or may span many years (e.g. does prenatal exposure to smoking affect semen quality?) In reproductive health we study determinants of factors that play a role for successful reproduction. Sometimes this involves studies that span generations, and many studies address couples, or families, rather than individuals. Unlike other fields of epidemiology, the individuals studied in reproductive epidemiology are often not ill in the common meaning of the word. Women who have repeated abortions or give birth to dead or severely malformed children are usually healthy themselves, and so are their partners. Similarly, even women who become severely ill during pregnancy, for instance with preeclampsia, often fully recover if the pregnancy has been interrupted in time. Their risk of experiencing pre-eclampsia in their next pregnancy is, however, relatively high.",

Part of this process is subject to epidemiologic observation. Although the maternal and paternal evolutionary interests are similar as far as gene transmission is concerned, the mother plays an additional role. She provides not only half of the foetal genes, but also the environment in which the foetus develops and is nourished over the duration of pregnancy and, in many cases, also for a period of time after birth (through breastfeeding). Pregnancy can be life threatening for the mother, and it is estimated that in Africa the lifetime risk for a woman to die of pregnancy-related causes is 1 in 16, while in more developed countries this figure is 1 in 1800 or even lower (AbouZahr 1998). Situations may thus occur when a pregnancy, which is too costly, is interrupted for the sake of the mother's chance of reproducing again (Haig 1993) . The uterine environment's role is therefore of great importance, but it is often difficult to disentangle its effects from those that are genetically mediated by the mother. Sometimes it is the interaction between foetal and maternal genes that may trigger adverse outcomes, such as recurrent spontaneous abortions. Reproductive epidemiology has acquired a powerful tool with the new genetic technologies. Using these tools will, hopefully, provide new important clues on the complex events taking place from conception to birth and onwards.",

We not only need to identify determinants of reproductive failures connected to lifestyle, occupation, environment, diet, or medication, but also to find out how antenatal care (ANC) can be best organized. Antenatal care is, in many countries, the most expensive part of preventive care within the health care system. At present, only a limited part of ANC is evidence-based and much more research is still needed, especially in countries where resources are sparse. Much of this documentation has to be time-and place-specific. Evidence on health care technology cannot just be transferred from one country to another.

We should make it one of the priorities of reproductive epidemiology to study whether and to what extent these factors will affect future generations. Reproduction is, in many ways, a playground for new technologies that are being introduced without much concern for the longterm consequences. Children of in vitro fertilization (IVF) are still too young for us to study whether they may suffer any long-term health consequence associated with the mode of their conception. Interventions like intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) may undermine the very core of the natural selective forces behind reproduction. At present we do not know if ICSI is a safe assisted reproductive technology (Ludwig and Diedrich 2002) , although early reports are reassuring to some extent.",

Some of those health problems may never come to the attention of the treating physician and must be disentangled by research. In relation to this and many other technologies, epidemiologists have an important role to play in monitoring disease data over time in the population. Reproductive health should be an important part of any health surveillance system. It is peculiar to reproduction that during pregnancy the mother provides most of the exposures that may influence the future health of the unborn child. The foetus is only partly protected by the placental barrier. Many toxic substances pass this barrier and the developing foetus will often be less able than the mother to metabolise these substances, especially early in pregnancy. This is e.g. the case with alcohol, caffeine, and several drugs.",

That pregnancy itself, or phenomena related to pregnancy, might have something to do with the aetiology of these diseases is suggested by the fact that females are more subject to autoimmune diseases than males, although these differences may also depend on immunological, hormonal, or other factors that are related to sex but not specifically to pregnancy (Whitacre et al. 1999; Whitacre 2001) . Changes in physiological status during pregnancy may have health implications for the mother as well as for the child, and the growing foetus totally depends upon maternal supply of nutrition and oxygen. Changes in this supply may 'reprogramme' organ development with possible long-term health consequences (Barker 1994 ).",

However, even if the dependency between pregnancies were to be modelled in the analysis, it is not clear whether doing this would produce a different type of bias, because the statistical model will not take selective change in behaviours related to pregnancy history into consideration. Pregnancies are, in many cases, planned as a function of the outcome of a previous pregnancy, and this aspect can hardly be addressed by methods aimed at accounting for the statistical dependency between pregnancies. An unwanted abortion or a stillbirth may be replaced very shortly with a new pregnancy in order to have the desired child. A surviving child with severe handicaps may delay or stop further childbearing, while parents of a child that dies with the same handicap may attempt a new pregnancy soon. Some exposures will be avoided as a result of how previous pregnancy ended. A mother who is a heavy smoker and had a child with a very low birth weight may well give up smoking when she becomes pregnant again, even in situations where smoking was not the only or even the major cause of the low birth weight. If smoking was not the only cause of low birth weight, she may then become a non-smoking pregnant woman with a high a-priori risk of getting a child with a low birth weight. How should that be addressed in the statistical analysis? Or how would we be able to design a proper counterfactual comparison? This type of confounding by the risk that triggers a change in exposure is very difficult to rule out, and it is a common and often neglected problem. A valid analytical solution may be to study first pregnancie only (Olsen 1994) , but this approach may prove to be too conservative in the sense that it removes available information and will thus reduce statistical power. Furthermore, there is heterogeneity on outcomes depending on parity, some of which may be due to selection (not all women will be able -or want -to have a new pregnancy), others probably depend on physiology or on changes in the uterine environment brought about by the previous pregnancy|ies. A first pregnancy modifies the uterine arteries in such a way that placentation is facilitated in the successive pregnancies.",

Many reproductive outcomes tend to recur in different pregnancies of the same woman, and this provides the opportunity to examine whether some putative factors play a role in the aetiology of a given event by studying women who had the outcome in question in a pregnancy and estimating whether their recurrence risk changes accordingly as a function of a change in a given factor in between the two pregnancies (Olsen et al. 1997) . This design, which we called 'the computerized square dance design', makes it possible to estimate whether the paternal genome plays a role by studying maternal half siblings. It can be applied to reproductive failures as well as disorders occurring in early childhood, such as febrile seizures (Vestergaard et al. 2002) . One of the advantages of this approach is that a great deal of confounding is adjusted for by using the woman as her own control. One aspect that has to be taken into consideration is that time plays a role, and thus the interval between pregnancies may have to be taken into account, especially when studying the effect of changing partners, since women who change partner tend to have a much longer interpregnancy interval Skjaerven et al. 2002) .",

Such an exposure would produce a low abortion rate because abortions now would occur in the pre-clinical phase. For this reason, the timing of pregnancy diagnosing is important. If women who take a long time to become pregnant seek earlier confirmation of pregnancy (compared to women who have not waited a long time), they will also be aware of early losses that would not be detected by women who were not aware that they were pregnant. This type of bias may be partly responsible for the association between subfecundity and spontaneous abortion, where good quality data on early conceptions are available (Baird et al. 1993) .

Congenital malformations that occur in utero and end as abortions, some as very early abortions, are usually not detected. Some exposures may simultaneously increase the incidence of some congenital malformations while at the same time reducing the survival rate of the affected foetuses (or embryos) in utero, thus decreasing the prevalence at birth. Monitoring systems of congenital malformations with no data on spontaneous abortions could therefore miss important teratogens and even wrongly conclude that a given factor is protective. Many of the established monitoring systems on the possible teratogenic effects of medicines taken during pregnancy are based only on data on prevalence at birth. When dealing with spontaneous abortions and congenital malformations, missing early losses may lead us to biased effects measures. Many of the routine monitoring systems are furthermore of poor quality, partly because only some of the congenital malformations are visible at birth.

Still, no studies in humans have shown that binge drinking alone causes cognitive impairments or any other important FAS characteristics, perhaps because all studies have been too small. If the exposure window is short, then only a small fraction of binge drinkers will be at risk and small studies will thus have no power to detect an effect unless all the study subjects are exposed at the right gestational time.

It is furthermore believed that hormonal factors influence the probability of developing some diseases in adult life. For example, it has been suggested that a high intrauterine oestrogen level may modify breast cancer risk (Trichopoulos 1990 ) and reduce the number of Sertoli cells, thus subsequently reducing semen production and increase the risk of undescended testis, hypospadia and testis cancer. This latter hypothesis is, however, not corroborated by epidemiologic findings in general and it probably has to be modified to fit existing data (Strohsnitter et al. 2001 ). There is, on the other hand, clear evidence of an association between some of these diseases. Patients with testis cancer have a higher frequency of undescended testis and apparently a lower fecundity before the cancer is diagnosed (Jacobsen et al. 2000) Macro-epidemiologic (ecologic) studies furthermore show that the geographical variation in e.g. testis cancer is often followed by similar geographical variations in low sperm counts and a high prevalence of malformations of the male genitalia. The link between testis cancer and undescended testis is considered established, although most studies have been based upon self-report of undescended testis, often reported retrospectively. Many undescended testis descend spontaneously shortly after birth or at puberty. More recent studies based upon recording at birth show a weaker association between testis cancer and undescended testis (Stang et al. 2001; Sabroe and Olsen 1998) . It is possible that only persistent undescended testis correlate with the risk of testis cancer. It is unclear whether descent through treatment eliminates the risk or whether the risk is caused by the underlying reasons of the displacement itself. If the risk is a function of underlying hormonal disturbances at the time period of organogenesis, treatment is not expected to affect cancer risk.",

Case-control studies may easily be confounded by genetic factors when they are applied to populations with a mixture of different ethnic groups. The parents are by definition ethnically matched to the case, and they are furthermore usually motivated to take part in the study. The two non-transmitted parental alleles can be compared to the two transmitted alleles, and since this Mendelian transmission occurs at random the observed allele structure can be compared with the expected values. If the parents e.g. both have the allele structure Aa, the children will under Mendelian transmission be AA, Aa, Aa or aa with equal probabilities; 25% probability of AA and aa, respectively, and 50% of Aa.",

Fecundity could therefore, depending on the specific study, describe the ability to obtain a biochemically detected pregnancy (by means of hCG), a clinically recognised pregnancy, or a pregnancy that led to a liveborn child. Fecundity can thus be used to describe the capacity to achieve any of these endpoints, which may be confusing. On the other hand, having a specific term for each of these situations would complicate communication to an even larger extent. The fact that we use the term fecundity to refer to a variety of situations has to be kept in mind. Childlessness can be voluntary or involuntary, and the latter may be subject to epidemiologic research. Subfecundity is a frequent problem, and treatment for subfecundity is a rapidly growing sector of many health care systems. Research that can potentially lead to prevention of subfecundity is therefore receiving increasing attention, and epidemiology plays an important part in this research. Subfecundity is a measure for a couple and is defined on the basis of unsuccessful attempts for a given length of time (usually 6, 12, or 24 months). In many industrialised countries, about 15% of all couples that try to become pregnant will experience subfecundity, if this is defined as a waiting time of 12 months (Juul et al. 1999) . The term infertility usually describes an unsuccessful waiting time of 12 or 24 months.

The entire TTP distribution will, however, normally be used in the analysis, e.g. in a discrete Cox model. Such a study need not last 12 or 24 months. Even a study with a follow-up time of only one cycle could provide evidence that smoking women have, on average, a fecundability that is approximately 20% lower than that of non-smoking women. We would then e.g. expect 30 out of 100 non-smoking women to be pregnant within the first cycle versus 24 out of 100 smoking women. Exclusion criteria may be used to get rid of noninformative couples in the study of environmental causes of sub-fecundity. Sexual activity could be recorded and taken into consideration in the analysis as well as time of pregnancy detection. Such a study is straightforward to design and to analyse, but extremely difficult and expensive to carry out, unless it is based upon couples that are seeking treatment for infertility, like IVF patients. Results from infertility patients are, however, hampered by limited generalizability to the population at large, partly because the couples are highly selected, partly because of the forces of clinical selection that are being used. Spermatozoa, eggs, and fertilised eggs are selected by the health personnel according to criteria quite different from the 'natural' selection. A longitudinal study on pregnancy planners may also provide other related endpoints, such as information on early abortions or semen quality.",

In a survey, the selected women will try to record attempts to become pregnant, exposures of relevanceoften from the same time period -infertility treatment, and TTP (or time waited in unsuccessful pregnancy attempts). Population studies of this type are relatively inexpensive and they usually rest on random sampling principles. The main problem is accurate recall, especially of exposures at the relevant point in time (the starting time), and the ability to obtain response rates that do not introduce selection bias. Analysing data may be simple, although TTPs usually have to be recorded in quite broad categories, and often referring to months rather than to cycles. Women may be able to recall if they had to wait for 6, 12 or more months to become pregnant, but usually they will not be able to remember if they became pregnant after 5, 6 or 7 months of waiting time when that waiting time took place several years ago. (They will probably remember if they became pregnant in the first month of trying.) Digit preference also has to be taken into consideration, as clusters of reporting will be seen at specific waiting times (such as 6 or 12 months).",

They are usually more willing to take part in studies than other women, and they are usually able to accurately report their TTP if the pregnancy was planned. They usually remember when planning started, and may be able to recall the exposures around the starting time, at least if the planning did not start too long ago, or if the exposure refers to the occupation they held at the time, or whether they were smoking or not. Since pregnancy is a condition for participation in the study, this design is unable to pick up an all-or-none effect of an exposure. An exposure that causes sterility will not be identified in a sample of pregnant women. Fortunately, most exposures that we know of are not of this type, and the exposures that reduce fecundability will show a longer TTP in a pregnancy-based study. The qualitative effect measure that comes from a study of this kind is, however, not a measure of fecundability in itself (Olsen and Andersen 1999) , although it will correlate with fecundability under a number of conditions. The most important, and often neglected, of these conditions is the persistency in trying to become pregnant. This persistency should not be related to the exposure under study, because, if so, the exposure may falsely appear to increase fecundity (Basso et al. 2000b ). The timing of diagnosing a pregnancy also plays a role. If couples wait very long to have a pregnancy verified, then an early abortion may count as waiting time. Had they used a sensitive pregnancy test early, the event would have been recognized as a TTP of a given length followed by an abortion. The length of the waiting time may influence the timing of detecting, thus potentially producing bias (Baird et al. 1993 ). Since socio-cultural factors may influence the couples' behaviour, this could pose a problem, especially if the exposure of interest is an occupational one that correlates with social and cultural conditions. Exposures that cause irregular or long cycles may also interfere with the timing of pregnancy recognition as well as with the ability to report the starting time on the TTP.",

The observed number of liveborns before exposure may be close to expected values based upon age and calendar time specific rates in the population at large.

The source population could be defined by all those who would come to our treatment centre if they had a similar infertility problem as our cases had in the time period of study.

Had we known the source population, we could have sampled controls from this group at the time the cases came to be detected. Candidates for controls selection would then be couples who have planned a pregnancy and who would be cases if they had a waiting time of 12 months or longer. We could then compare exposures at starting time, or before, and estimate the relative risk of being infertile as a function of the exposures under study. The problem in this design is that we do not know the source population and it may be impossible, even in principle, to identify it along with its exposure experience. A viable option may be to take advantage of the fact that infertility is a couple phenomenon. Infertility is sometimes caused by exposures mediated through female factors, sometimes through male factors, and sometimes through both male and female factors. If we e.g. take an interest in exposures to prenatal tobacco smoking as a cause of 'male infertility' we may then compare the frequency of this exposure for males in couples that had a male problem (e.g. poor sperm quality) with the exposure frequency in males for couples where the female was identified as having the problem. Both sets of couples sought help and therefore belong to the source population. Since couples where both members have a fecundity problem belong to both the case and the control group, they do not provide useful information for the question under study and can be excluded.",

If complete follow-up is not possible, as for longer follow-up periods, the risk may be estimated by connecting incidence rates (IR) to risk (CI) according to the formula CI = 1 \u2212 e \u2212IR (cf. Chap. I.2 of this handbook). This calculation from rates to risk requires stable incidence rates over the time period during which they are measured. Rates describe occurrence of events per time unit, like new respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) cases per 1000 observation months in children less than 1 year in a given region and a given time period. Rates are thus for populations. Risks indicate the probability of a given event in a given time period and for an average member of the population in question. In a population with complete follow-up, the risk of e.g. 2nd trimester abortions in 500 pregnant women who are followed until the start of the 3rd trimester is estimated as 0.02 if 10 of the 500 women abort in these 3 months.",

If 500 women are pregnant in a population of 50,000, the pregnancy prevalence proportion is 0.01 (500|50,000). Since prevalence (P) is a function of incidence (I) and duration (D), the incidence of new pregnancies in a steady state population would be 500|8, if the average duration of a pregnancy is set at 8 months, taking abortions into consideration, that is 62.5 pregnant women per month in the population of 50,000, or 750 per year.",

When the pregnancy is planned, the time from the start of the pregnancy planning to a recognised pregnancy and to the end of the pregnancy may be known. Estimating the incidence rate of spontaneous abortions requires registration of time from conception to the abortion in question or to gestational week 24. At best, the time of conception may be identified by means of biochemical measures at a very early stage, but in most cases a pregnancy diagnosis is not established until 3-4 weeks after conception at the earliest, and then it is retrospectively estimated by means of last menstrual period data (LMP) or -later -by using growth measures based upon ultrasound examination. Observation time for calculating rates of spontaneous abortions, therefore, often starts at different time periods in gestation, and in studies we have to take this delayed entry into consideration to obtain meaningful results when we try e.g. to identify determinants of spontaneous abortions (Baird et al. 1993 ).",

Birth weight usually follows a normal distribution with a small 'bump' in the left side tail, mainly representing pre-term births. The size of the residual (usually reported in percent of the total) is a stronger predictor of the perinatal mortality for the population than the proportion of newborns with a low birth weight (< 2500 g), which is the present indicator used in monitoring systems. If we follow Allen Wilcox's thinking, the aim should not be to change the birth weight distribution for the population, but to reduce the residual portion of the distribution, i.e. the proportion falling outside the Gaussian distribution. This translates mainly into preventing pre-term birth rather than increasing birth weight. Most reproductive epidemiologists would probably agree on this strategy. The present obesity epidemic in many countries is e.g. expected to increase birth weight in the com-ing years, but not to decrease perinatal mortality; in fact, we may observe the opposite.",

Since the birth weight distribution is population specific, it is wise to use an internal reference rather than an external reference if the study is large enough. Using SGA measures has the disadvantage that they do not make use of the birth weight distribution. The SGA term should furthermore not be taken as a measure of intrauterine Growth Retardation (IUGR) since the term SGA is purely descriptive.

The foetus will try to take as much of the nutritional supply as possible, while the mother needs to reserve some for herself to continue her (reproductive) life. According to Haig, during the course of evolution genes have been shaped to balance these two aims. Data furthermore show that the 'optimal birth weight' is population specific but is correlated with the average birth weight in the specific population (Graafmans et al. 2002) .

If the central tendency of two measures (ultrasound and LMP) are the same, but one is measured with larger measurement errors (like LMP), then the imprecise measure will lead to more pre-and post-term births, provided that the central tendency is the same. In a study of pre-or postterm delivery it is therefore important that gestational age is at least measured using the same methods in the groups to be compared. If studies are based upon routine registrations of gestational age, it may not be known how it was measured. If the exposure under study correlates with early foetal growth, LMP should be applied. If the exposure correlates with menstrual irregularities, then ultrasound is preferable. In order to detect a given difference in gestational age between two compared groups, a larger sample size is usually needed if gestational age is estimated by LMP compared with ultrasound estimates.",

If only LMP measures are available, one may find that women with irregular or long menstrual periods have a longer TTP, as many women with subfecundity may have irregular cycles. The measure of time to pregnancy itself will be affected by this irregularity, since time to pregnancy, although sometimes reported in months, should -however -reflect the number of cycles that a couple takes to achieve a clinically detectable pregnancy. In such cases, not only imprecision but also bias can affect the effect measures, and the burden to estimate how much the observed effect can be ascribed to these problems falls on the researcher. If ultrasound measurements are not available, one way to assess whether the association may be due to bias caused by differential misclassification of gestational age could be to use birth weight as a support measure to corroborate the finding. Since birth weight is less subject to error and its accuracy is less, if at all, dependent on correlates of the exposure, this may provide reassurance for the finding -or grounds for rejecting it. If there is no difference in the birth weight distribution according to time to pregnancy before adjustment for gestational age, this suggests that most of, or all, the observed effect is due to differential measurement error of gestational age. If, on the other hand, the birth weight of children born to women with a long time to pregnancy is lower than that of women with a short time to pregnancy, this is an indication that there is at least some effect of time to pregnancy on gestational duration, if there are no residual confounders that can reduce birth weight that are more common in women with long time to pregnancy. (This would be a problem if, for instance, short women -who have lighter babies -also had a longer time to pregnancy than tall women, but a gestation of the same duration). A long time to pregnancy may have an effect on foetal growth as well as on gestational age, and one could thus estimate this by adjusting for gestational age when examining birth weight as a function of time to pregnancy.",

Women who have short intervals are likely to have less accurate estimate of gestational age, because cycles resume some time after a pregnancy, and they may be irregular at first. Therefore, women with very short intervals may have systematically inaccurate measures of gestational age. Again, by checking with birth weight one can try to assess whether there is evidence of this phenomenon. Although short interpregnancy intervals have been associated with both preterm delivery and low birth weight, in a study among Danish women ) only the association with preterm delivery was observed, while the one with low birth weight disappeared entirely after adjustment for preterm delivery.",

Now it would often be partly LMP and partly ultrasound based, or based upon ultrasound measures only. From a monitoring point of view this raises issues of concern related to comparability over time. The standard used to estimate gestational age based upon BPD should be appropriate and that means both time-and population-specific. It should be a standard for the population it is applied to, and it should be changed over time if foetal growth in the population changes over time. Many countries face increasing obesity problems, which may influence not only birth weights but also early foetal growth.

The effects of any exposure under study reflect only the effect remaining after health care intervention. This limitation is always true, but it is especially important to keep in mind when studying pregnancy duration, especially post-term birth. A birth may be induced when the clinicians believe the child is better off outside the uterus, or perhaps just because they believe the child is sufficiently mature to be born, or if the mother's health is at risk if the pregnancy is continued. A pregnancy may then be terminated by a caesarean section, by medically induced labour, or by other means. In any case, a substantial number of pregnancies are not carried to a 'natural' end, and these observations are censored in the life table terminology. Since the censoring, in many cases, will be associated with the risk of pregnancy or birth complications, we cannot study e.g. the risk associated with post-term birth per se. The only option is to study what remains of risk after health care intervention. In like manner, one cannot study determinants of post-term delivery, only determinants for pregnancies that are allowed to continue after 42 weeks of gestation. Although these limitations are self-evident, they are often not mentioned in scientific reports -perhaps because they are self-evident. In our experience they may be self-evident but are often 'forgotten', even among experienced epidemiologists.

The main advantage with the case-control is having the possibility to collect valid exposure information concerning the pregnancy (often very early pregnancy) by means of interviews. These data may, however, be difficult or even impossible to obtain for exposures that are difficult to recall. The recall easily leads to bias related to a lack in symmetry of the information obtained from a woman who had a child with a severe handicap when compared to the information provided by a woman who had a healthy child. Using another set of patient controls (e.g. another type of congenital malformation than the one under study) may be a possible solution, although it is not without problems. When using patient controls as a surrogate for representative source population samples, the \"control\" disease should neither be caused nor prevented by the exposure under study, and, since we know so little about the causes of most malformations, this might be a hazardous decision to make. However, interviewing women who all had a child with congenital malformations should render the quality of information more comparable, thus reducing the potential for bias (Swan et al. 1992 ). There is indication of a more accurate recall of medicine intake in mothers who had a child with a congenital malformation than in mothers, who had a healthy child (Rockenbauer et al. 2001) . Furthermore, it has been shown that the way questions on medicine intake are phrased plays an important role (Mitchell et al. 1986 ).",

This definition is rather general and not in line with what most people would think of as being a pregnancy complication. A puerperal depression is considered as triggered by the birth and not just a depression that happens to occur shortly after delivery, although it may be difficult to distinguish a depression triggered by birth from a depression that would have occurred in any case. In these paragraphs we will, therefore, deal with some aspects of complications that are only seen during pregnancy, or which are only defined as such during a pregnancy. We will briefly deal with some common pregnancy complications (such as hyperemesis and placenta previa), reserving a particular emphasis to gestational diabetes and pre-eclampsia, the former because it is a clear example of some of the problems facing epidemiologists who deal with pregnancy complications. Pre-eclampsia is relatively common and a serious complication of pregnancy, and it is also one of the most fascinating mysteries of reproduction.",

It is likely that most of them will be seen among pregnant women, but with a lower prevalence than in the general population, especially if they are severely debilitating for the woman in her reproductive years. The 'healthy pregnancy effect' is analogous to the better known 'healthy worker effect' and is due to the fact that a reasonably good health is required to conceive and carry a pregnancy to term. This \"effect\" need not cause bias if properly addressed in the design of the study. The 'healthy pregnancy effect' only underlines the fact that many diseases will be less frequent among parous women if these diseases interfere with actual fertility.",

            "text": "A general problem in studying pregnancy complications is due to the fact that many such conditions are defined as an extreme of events that occur in the course of a normal pregnancy. Thus, a disease that represents an extreme value of the distribution of a given trait rather than a qualitatively different entity will be more problematic to study. In this case, the distinction between normal and pathological becomes relatively blurred, and very often the challenge faced by clinicians is that of defining a cut-point beyond which a condition is declared a disease (as in obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and pre-eclampsia) and below which the same condition is considered within the norm. It is immediately evident that definitions of this type are susceptible to many problems, as is the case with all diseases defined this way, because any arbitrary threshold will introduce some degree of misclassification, especially since pregnancy is a condition under intensive medical surveillance, which will then make pregnant women a population in which virtually the entirety of its members will be screened for severe diseases one way or the other and, in most cases, more than once in the course of pregnancy. It is well-known that even a test with a high specificity will produce a large number of false positives in a population with a low prevalence of a disease, and this leads to women being unnecessarily treated and subjected to the stress of being diagnosed with a disease they may not have. On the other hand, missing women with a given disease by moving the cut-point towards more extreme values will result in a low sensitivity that will lead to missing cases with consequences that may be very serious for the mother and the baby. The extent of these problems depends not only on the criteria for defining a disease but also on the approach adopted by the care providers, the access to prenatal care, and the frequency with which pregnant women are monitored. The more frequently women are seen and their blood glucose, blood pressure, or proteinuria are measured, the more likely it will be that they can be wrongly classified as having a given disorder, especially if these measures fluctuate over time. Conversely, women that are not screened often or do not comply with prenatal care may be under-diagnosed in these circumstances. Factors related to monitoring, such as insurance coverage, distance from antenatal care centres, etc., can thus produce bias, especially -but not only -if risk factors for the disease are also part of the reasons why women comply less with prenatal care (smoking may, in some circumstances, fulfil these criteria). In some cases, modelling the number of ANC visits or other factors affecting the access to ANC (distance, social class, insurance plan when applicable) might provide a clue about whether a problem of this type has occurred, but this will not necessarily be sufficient to correct for the bias.",

Often researchers do not have the crude values of what is actually measured but only the clinical diagnosis, which makes virtually every study susceptible to well founded criticism because the uncertainty and potential inaccuracy of the diagnosis may well depend on the putative risk factors under study. Random errors will also tend to dilute associations, often conspiring towards this end with the number of false positives that will be included in most case series. We are thus left with studying the phenotype that clinicians in that particular region and at a given point in time call a disease, which may not be the best classification from an etiological point of view.",

            "text": "Most readers will be familiar with the concepts of sensitivity and specificity. In the presence of a 'gold standard' diagnosis that is the 'truth' about whether a patient has a disease or not, the sensitivity of a given test is calculated as the number of subjects who test positive among the diseased divided by the total number of diseased. A test has a sensitivity of 1 when all with the disease are identified by the test. The specificity of a test, on the other hand, is calculated as the total number of subjects who test negative among the non-diseased divided by the total number of all non-diseased (cf. Chap. III.10 of this handbook). A test with a specificity of 1 will correctly identify as negatives all truly negative (no disease). There is probably no single test that will have both a sensitivity and a specificity of 1, so researchers have to live with a margin of error, even when several tests are used in a sequence or in parallel. The use of the concepts of sensitivity and specificity relies on a rather strong and often forgotten assumption: that the process in question (the disease) is inherently dichotomous (that is, of the yes|no type). Although we often think of a disease as either present or absent and, for practical purposes, that is the way clinicians often treat them, this concept is a construct that depends on the definition of the disease, its severity and on the stage of the disease and does not necessarily reflect the underlying physiology -especially when we use a single marker to determine presence or absence of the disease. However, with this caveat in mind, the concepts of sensitivity and specificity can be useful. Associated with these are the concepts of positive and negative predictive values, which are the fractions that will be truly positive (or negative) given that they had tested positive (or negative). A test performed in a population with a high prevalence will, in general, perform fairly well in terms of negative and positive predictive values as long as sensitivity and specificity are high. In a large population with a low prevalence (say 1|1000), however, even a test with unrealistically high values of sensitivity and specificity for a clinical test (say, a sensitivity of 0.99 and a specificity of 0.98) will yield a large fraction of false positives among all those who test positive (with the above values, of the 21 that would be classified as positive in a population of 1000, 20 would be false positives). This misclassification will pose a serious problem to any epidemiologic study by diluting the case series.",

Each chosen cutpoint would result in a certain proportion of subjects, who fail to be classified as diseased, being diseased (false negatives) and in a certain proportion of subjects, who would test positive, being in truth negative (false positives). To build a ROC curve the test is performed by progressively moving the cut-point from a lax one (in which a great number of false positives would be included) to a strict one (in which a high proportion of false negatives would be included; see also Chap. III.10 of this handbook). In the figure, a cut-off point of about 1.19 would produce Figure 5 .3.

The area of overlap reflects the misclassification encountered when a given threshold is used to determine the disease status a sensitivity close to 1, and a cut-off at 1.67 a specificity close to 1. When the measurement is not quantitative but is based -for instance -on radiographic results, the observer is asked to classify several times the same subject using a different rating for classifying disease: very likely positive|likely positive|unlikely positive|very unlikely positive. Of course, the 'true status' of the subjects has to be known with a degree of 'certainty' from a different source when building ROC curves. ROC curves are used to find the cut-point that maximizes benefits and minimizes side effects (taking into consideration the cost of missing a true positive and that of having a number of false positives).",

If a study is based on all diagnoses, even those made in early pregnancy, cases may include a number of these early cases, which represent a rather harmless condition. However, if placenta previa persists, the common practice is that of performing a caesarean section to deliver the baby and thus, by including only the women diagnosed with placenta previa who were later delivered by caesarean, one will probably be limiting the analysis to the more severe or, at least, the more persistent cases.

Hyperemesis, severe vomiting in pregnancy, is another example of a normal condition becoming pathological when presenting itself in an extreme fashion. Several studies investigated foetal outcome among women who had hyperemesis, with conflicting results (Depue et al. 1987; Kallen 1987; Godsey and Newman 1991; Hallak et al. 1996; Gross et al. 1989 ). Yet, a recent review states that severe vomiting does not have a negative effect on perinatal outcome (Eliakim et al. 2000) . However, if the definition of the case series is based on a hospital diagnosis without taking severity into consideration, then the cases may include a number of women with a relatively mild disease that is not really distinct from the 'normal' nausea and vomiting of pregnancy. Restricting cases to those where some objective biomarkers, such as severe ketosis or serum electrolyte disturbance, can be measured may then provide a more purely defined case series, which might be one of the reasons for the inconsistent findings.",

Hyperemesis occurs more frequently in women carrying multiple foetuses, as well as in women (carrying singletons) who will later be diagnosed with pre-eclampsia (Zhang and Cai 1991) . These observations suggest that there might be multiple causal paths leading to hyperemesis and that, in some women, a large placenta (with a high hormone production) may be the cause of the disease, while in others hyperemesis may be a sign of some other pathological process under way. In any circumstance, whenever etiologic heterogeneity exists in a process, and signs and symptoms are the same as that of another process (so that they are considered the same disorder), it is always very difficult to disentangle what is being studied. If only a small fraction of the case population represents a different etiologic entity, even a moderately strong predictor will likely appear not to be associated with the mixed entity and it will be repeatedly missed. If the fraction is large, then a predictor will be called a risk factor for both entities, and perhaps this uncertainty contributes to some of the failures of epidemiology to encourage changes in people's habits and in policies.

            "text": "As many other metabolic functions, the metabolism of carbohydrates is altered in normal pregnancies. The fasting blood glucose level decreases early in pregnancy until the 12th week, and it usually remains at this lower level until the end of pregnancy. Insulin, by contrast, remains stable during the 1st and 2nd trimesters, but increases during the 3rd. Outside pregnancy, on the other hand, the blood glucose level returns rapidly to fasting levels after a meal, and in pregnancy both glucose and insulin levels reach higher peaks than they would after a similar meal in the non-pregnant state. This level is furthermore maintained for a longer time. Human placental lactogen (hPL) is the hormone that is believed to be responsible for these changes in the metabolism (Haig 1993) . In general, pregnancy is a state of mild insulin resistance, and some women develop gestational diabetes. As an adaptation, insulin production is increased at the same time that the mother is becoming insulin-resistant. Haig (1993) proposes an interesting hypothesis about why this change may occur within his evolutionary theory about the genetic conflicts of pregnancy. Glucose is an important nutrient for the growing foetus, but it is also important for the mother's survival that not too many of her resources are depleted by the foetus, which may happen if foetal demands went unopposed: the decline in blood glucose early in pregnancy could thus represent a maternal attempt to limit foetal uptake. In addition, after every meal there will be a competition between the mother and the foetus over the respective share. The longer it takes the mother to reduce her blood sugar, the higher the share taken by the foetus, hence the insulin resistance, according to Haig. At the beginning of pregnancy, the foetus has limited growing demands and limited 'power', which is why the mother succeeds in 'hiding' her blood glucose. During the third trimester, however, the foetus has very high growing demands and it is strong enough to take the upper hand in the competition with the mother. When seen in the light of how to optimise survival probabilities, this is an attractive hypothesis, although hard to test. Barker (1995 Barker ( , 1998 has a different hypothesis, suggesting that insulin resistance is a consequence of limited nutrient supply. Clearly, however, glucose metabolism is crucial in pregnancy, and a mechanism has evolved that creates a delicate balance between the maternal and foetal needs. Diabetes during pregnancy is a complex problem and requires a very careful management to prevent damages to the foetus and to the mother. The consequences of gestational diabetes may be dire for the foetus; as with gestational diabetes there is an increased risk of stillbirth and macrosomia (Schmidt et al. 2001; Johnstone et al. 1990 ). Macrosomia is the most frequent outcome in diabetic mothers, and this can complicate delivery to the point that a caesarean section is required. Women who have had gestational diabetes are at increased risk of having it again in a subsequent pregnancy and are also at risk of developing diabetes (Dornhorst and Beard 1993) , especially type 2, later in life. Gestational diabetes, as well as other types of diabetes, is also a risk factor for pre-eclampsia (Schmidt et al. 2001) , another potentially severe pregnancy complication. Obesity is a predisposing factor (with insulin resistance the underlying condition), as is advanced maternal age or having a family history of diabetes.",

The discussion extends to whether there should be universal screening for all pregnant women. In 1996, the American Diabetes Association concluded that universal screening should be done, but these recommendations were then revised in 1997 and 1998 to selective screening of women satisfying at least one criterion among (1) age above 25, (2) age below 25 and a body mass index above 27, (3) a family history of diabetes, and (4) belonging to ethnic groups with a known higher predisposition to diabetes. There is no agreement over the 'gold standard' test for women who are screened positive. The oral glucose tolerance test is the norm, but the load (the dose of administered glucose) varies geographically. There is also discussion about which cut-off limits should be used, as the prevalence of gestational diabetes would change depending upon the threshold, and the risk would be to either define too many women who are not diabetic as such or to miss too many women who are diabetic and at risk of having an adverse pregnancy or health outcome. There is no clear distinction between normal and pathological values, which hampers any diagnostic criterion. Often, epidemiologists do not deal with the actual values of glucose level but with the clinical diagnosis collected over several hospitals, without guarantee of uniformity in the criteria used for screening and diagnosis. The diagnosis will also depend on whether glucose is measured or not and, since gestational diabetes is mostly asymptomatic, this is an added complication. Researchers planning studies requiring an accurate diagnosis of gestational diabetes should thus be aware of the medical attitude towards screening in pregnancy in the locations where they plan to collect their data and of the tools and cut-off levels in use, as well as of the criteria that govern which women are screened and which are not. At best, studies are based upon follow-up of cohorts that are all subject to testing within the same protocol.",

Long-term as well as short term consequences for the foetus have been identified, and in some countries the focus of the diagnosis of gestational diabetes has now shifted from the likelihood of progression to later chronic diabetes in the mother to the outcome of pregnancy; a shift that also has consequences on the diagnostic criteria. Since obesity is associated with a highly increased risk of type-2 diabetes as well as gestational diabetes, a number of women would only be diagnosed during pregnancy and the two types of diabetes would then be confused. However, since both types of diabetes increase the risk of pregnancy complications (such as pre-eclampsia) and of adverse foetal outcome, this may not be a major problem, depending on the specific purpose of the study. When studying pre-eclampsia, for instance, there are situations where it would be advisable to exclude women with pre-existing diabetes but not those with gestational diabetes (which shares with pre-eclampsia obesity as a risk factor and, possibly, other predictors) and this may prove to be difficult to do accurately. If and how much of an impact this could have on the estimates will once again depend on the specific situation and will in many cases be hard to evaluate.",

            "text": "Pre-eclampsia is, on the other hand, one of the most common and potentially severe complications of pregnancy. In pre-eclampsia, the maternal blood pressure can increase dramatically and heart, brain, and kidneys may be severely damaged. If the mother survives, the affected organs usually return to normality shortly after delivery, but pre-eclampsia can also be fatal. If seizures occur, the disease is called eclampsia (a very rare occurrence in countries with well-functioning health care systems) and the risk for both the mother and the foetus is then much higher. While eclampsia is a dramatic event that is probably rarely misclassified, pre-eclampsia is, by definition, much more elusive. In most countries, it is currently defined as the concurrent presence of hypertension and proteinuria. Gestational hypertension is defined as either a persistent rise of 25 mm Hg in systolic blood pressure during pregnancy compared to pre-pregnant values (if the pre-pregnant values are not known, a systolic blood pressure of 140 mm Hg or higher), or as a rise of 15 in diastolic blood pressure (DBP) (or as a DBP above 90). The definitions of gestational hypertension do, however, vary geographically. For the disorder to be called pre-eclampsia hypertension must be accompanied by a certain minimum level of proteinuria. The degree of severity depends on the values of blood pressure and the amount of protein loss, as well as additional signs and symptoms, often including oedema. Previously, preeclampsia was defined by the concomitant presence of two out of three symptoms (hypertension, proteinuria, and oedema), but the definition has changed to be restricted to cases where both hypertension and proteinuria are present at the same time, as oedema appeared to be too unspecific. The problem with this definition is, however, that a mild state of hypertension is common in pregnancy and, often, the pre-pregnant values are not known. What is termed moderate preeclampsia may thus, in some cases, be nothing more than a change in values of blood pressure and proteinuria within the norm. Sometimes, changes in these values may be severe enough to qualify for the diagnosis, but they will escape detection. Furthermore, some women become nervous when their blood pressure is taken in a clinical setting, and thus they would be classified as hypertensive while they are not ('white coat' hypertension). On the other hand, a number of cases may be missed by applying this definition, either because of ignorance of the baseline pre-pregnancy values, or because the women do not have their blood pressure measured at the moment of the increase and, if there are no severe symptoms, the diagnosis will never be made. In severe cases, women become very sick and there is little doubt about the diagnosis, but these cases are the minority.",

The invasive trophoblast enlarges the vessels from within, and a fibrin substance that renders them flaccid and unresponsive to maternal vasoconstriction replaces the vessels' internal lining. In pre-eclampsia often, but not always, the second trophoblastic invasion does not occur, or occurs only to a very modest degree (Salas 1999; Roberts and Lain 2002) , resulting in placental perfusion being severely compromised because the arteries are narrow and with a high resistance instead of being wide, low-resistance vessels, as they would be if the invasion had proceeded normally. Haig (1993) expresses the view that hypertension in pregnancy is a foetal adaptive mechanism. Because of the structure of the spiral arteries and the fact that sympathetic nerves disappear from the placental site during pregnancy, the maternal control of the blood flow to the placenta is limited and the placental site is characterized by low resistance to blood flow. Due to these characteristics, for any given resistance of the placental unit, a compensatory rise in the maternal peripheral blood pressure will increase the blood flow to the placenta. According to Haig, this may be a sign of a feto-maternal conflict, where the growing foetus is able -by some unknown mechanism -to increase maternal blood pressure and thus increase the placental blood flow. Drug-induced reduction of mean arterial pressure may be associated with a reduction in foetal growth (von Dadelszen et al. 2000) Pre-eclampsia is not, however, always accompanied by defective placentation, and is, most likely, a common syndrome resulting from heterogeneous causes (Ness and Roberts 1996) . It is believed that large placental mass (as seen in multiple pregnancies) and endothelial disease (as seen in diabetics) are mechanisms that can also produce placental hypoperfusion and start the cascade of events that leads to pre-eclampsia (Salas 1999) .",

Research based upon nationwide hospital registries can provide population-based data that may, however, be of limited quality if the only available information is the code according to the International Classification of Diseases. The advantages of these studies are that women are most likely unselected and that the numbers will be large enough to allow studying even relatively rare predictors or outcomes. In some cases, these studies might be the only viable option. If, to improve the quality of the data, researchers restrict their case series to severe pre-eclampsia only, then the numbers will be dramatically reduced but, possibly, fewer false positives will be included.",

If the women who accept to enter the study as controls do so according to the exposure under study, this will produce biased estimates to an extent that is often impossible to judge. Since pregnant women are invited to lead a healthy lifestyle for the sake of the baby if not their own, it is likely that some women whose pregnancy went well but whose habits were not beyond reproach would be relatively unwilling to take part in a study where such habits would be questioned. On the other hand, women who had a negative experience may be less reluctant to having their behaviour under scrutiny, because they want to know what went wrong.

This fact complicates the interpretation of studies attempting to evaluate whether pre-eclampsia is associated with conditions that are more common in babies that are born preterm, such as e.g. cerebral palsy. Some studies have reported that babies of pre-eclamptic pregnancies were protected from cerebral palsy when the risk was examined by gestational week at birth (Gray et al. 1998; Murphy et al. 1995) . Is this a protection conferred by pre-eclampsia, or is it an artefact due to the fact that the causes of preterm delivery in pre-eclamptic pregnancies differ from those of other preterm deliveries, where the causal factors may include those of cerebral palsy? Because babies born preterm for causes other than pre-eclampsia have other pathological mechanisms that advanced birth, disentangling the effects of preterm birth from its causes is a major challenge, and so is examining the various causal paths leading to preterm birth that may very well be implicated in the diseases 'associated' with preterm birth. Also, many cases of pre-eclampsia are delivered by emergency caesarean section, and the delivery complications due to caesarean section are generally different from those arising from vaginal deliveries, as many preterm deliveries will be. If complications that can arise from vaginal delivery are associated with cerebral palsy (e.g. anoxia), then comparing pre-eclamptic women with non pre-eclamptic will result in a biased comparison.",

If the date when pre-eclampsia was first diagnosed is known, data may be analysed through Cox regression or survival methods to overcome this problem (for a general introduction to survival analysis see Chap.

            "text": "If an important confounder is systematically omitted when studying a given disease, this will lead to the potential establishment of a wrong conclusion (cf. Chap. I.9 of this handbook). For example, a currently accepted hypothesis about the aetiology of pre-eclampsia proposes that a maternal immune reaction to paternal antigens may be a cause of the failed trophoblastic invasion. This hypothesis was mainly based on the observation that pre-eclampsia is more frequent in first pregnancies. Among multiparous, women who had changed their partner from the previous pregnancy had an increased risk (Dekker et al. 1998; Dekker 1999; Trupin et al. 1996; Lie et al. 1998; Li and Wi 2000) . Also, women with a long period of sexual cohabitation prior to a pregnancy and women using oral contraceptives appeared to be at a lower risk of the disease than women with a short cohabitation period or those using barrier contraceptive methods (Robillard et al. 1994; Dekker et al. 1998) . This suggested that a prolonged exposure to the partner's sperm may have constituted a protection that would reduce the risk of pre-eclampsia, thus leading to the expression that 'primipaternity' was a risk factor for pre-eclampsia. For some researchers (including the authors of this chapter), however, this hypothesis has lost some attraction since three studies (two based on the Norwegian Birth Registry (Skjaerven et al. 2002; Trogstad et al. 2001) , and one based on a sample from the Danish Birth Registry ) independently reported that this increased risk with change of partner disappeared if the interval between births was adjusted for. Women who change partner have, on average, a much longer interval between births: if any factor correlated with time has an impact on the risk of pre-eclampsia, then women waiting a longer time will have an increased risk, regardless of whether they change partner. This was found to be true in the above-mentioned studies, even after maternal age was controlled for. This finding prompted a further study where time to pregnancy was investigated in association with preeclampsia, as a fraction of the women waiting a long time between pregnancies may be subfecund. Time to pregnancy, as previously mentioned, is a proxy for the couple's fecundity and thus a relatively crude marker, since it reflects a multitude of disorders. It is, however, interesting that an association between long time to pregnancy and pre-eclampsia could be found despite these limitations (Basso et al. 2003) , and this evidence may lead to further research for identifying a subgroup of infertile women with a specific disorder that relates to preeclampsia.",

Because of malnutrition, many women had under-developed pelvises and the baby's head would remain trapped in the birth canal.

Therefore, only babies being born vaginally will be at risk of getting the umbilical cord wrapped around their neck, or of having any other accident during their descent through the birth canal that may affect the supply of oxygen to the brain. This would not be a problem if the decision of delivering a woman by caesarean section were independent of any factors that may put the baby at higher risk of encountering such mishaps, but -usually -this is not the case. Since the relative size of the mother and the baby or signs of foetal distress may well trigger the decision of performing a caesarean section, it is likely that babies born vaginally and those born by caesarean are not comparable before delivery, which will complicate any interpretation of findings associated with a given delivery complication. This will also complicate any study trying to evaluate the 'effects' of any given intervention during delivery, as it will be difficult to separate the effects of the intervention from the causes that provoked it, which may also be the causes of the outcome of interest. Even restricting to planned caesareans may not be sufficient to solve the problem, as caesareans are planned for a reason, and one likely reason is that a complication is foreseen and a caesarean section may prevent it from occurring. Experience in previous pregnancies will also affect the mode of delivery. A woman who has previously had a caesarean section will, in many cases, have one also for her next delivery, especially if the two pregnancies are close in time. Since many events tend to repeat themselves in one woman's reproductive life, it will be hard to decide what to do with such a woman, especially if the cause for her previous caesarean is not known.",

Permanent changes of organ function could, in principle, lead to many diseases (Olsen 2000) , but best documented are the associations between origins of disproportional foetal growth and cardiovascular diseases, perhaps through insulin resistance (Barker 1994 (Barker , 1995 (Barker , 1998 .",

These cohorts need to be large to provide sufficient information for rare outcomes. Large cohorts of this type were set up in the past, and the best known is probably the National Collaborative Perinatal Project from the USA, started in the late 1950s, where more than 50,000 pregnant women were enrolled. The cohort aimed at studying obstetrical complications and the risk of cerebral palsy and other neurological disorders, although the cohort has served many other research purposes since then.",

In particular, the fact that reproduction, even in our medicalised world, is a direct result of selective processes, which are still active. In addition, most of the events that we study in this area are what is left after main selection has taken place: selection of couples where a conception takes place, and further selection of those conceptions that will progress to clinical recognition and medical intervention, which may lead to anticipated delivery or a termination of pregnancy, or to treatment of a disorder. For this reason, denominators are usually unknown. Furthermore, the processes that occur during a pregnancy that ends in a birth are usually also hidden, and therefore we do not really know what has happened to the foetus during the most delicate phases of development.",

In many instances pregnancies are voluntary events and many women have several, although the decision to have further pregnancies (and their outcomes) often depends to some extent on the outcome of the previous ones. Time is also of crucial importance when dealing with reproductive epidemiology, but its dimension is generally different from the time involved in the development of, say, cancer after exposure to a given mutagenic substance. The types of bias that can occur in this area are, in many cases, peculiar to this discipline, and they have to be taken into consideration.",

We need to know much more about genetic and gene-environment interaction, not only in the development of congenital malformations and childhood cancers, but also for long-term organ programming (for an introduction to genetic epidemiology see Chap. III.7 of this handbook). Using information on genetic factors in e.g. metabolism of environmental exposures, like alcohol, may even be of help in examining confounding. How much of the association between e.g. alcohol and reproductive failures is due to confounding cannot be examined in a randomized trial, but the genetic factors that modify alcohol metabolism may follow 'Mendelian randomization' and thus provide a design for comparison that bypasses some of the problems associated with the intercorrelation between lifestyle factors (Smith and Ebrahim 2003) .",
