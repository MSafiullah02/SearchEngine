One hundred NPAs from pediatric patients that tested negative for the respiratory viruses listed above were randomly selected each month for HBoV testing by PCR. During the same period, fecal samples were also collected from pediatric patients with acute gastroenteritis, which was defined as the development of acute diarrhea with 3 or more loose stools per day. All fecal samples were tested for common bacterial diarrheal pathogens, rotavirus (by antigen detection [27]), and HBoV (by PCR). When HBoV was detected, the corresponding patients were identified, and their clinical features, laboratory results, and outcome were analyzed retrospectively.",

Primers were designed by multiple alignment of the genomes of HBoV available in GenBank, and additional primers were designed on the basis of the results of the first and subsequent rounds of sequencing. The terminal sequences were confirmed by a modified protocol for rapid amplification of cDNA ends [11]. However, these terminal sequences may be incomplete because of their hairpin structures. The nucleotide and the deduced amino acid sequences of the NS1, NP1, and VP1/VP2 genes were compared with those of HBoV strains with a complete genome sequence available in GenBank.

The genomic organization was the same as that of the 2 prototype HBoV strains, ST1 and ST2, and of other known bocaviruses, BPV and MVC. There were 3 open reading frames (ORFs), with the gene order NS1, NP1, and VP1/VP2. Sequence analysis showed that the 24 strains of HBoV displayed limited sequence variations among themselves as well as in relation to the available sequences of previously described HBoV strains in all 3 genes (figure 2). The NS1 gene was the most conserved gene among the 3, with only minor nucleotide polymorphisms. The predicted amino acid sequences of the NS1 gene of the 24 HBoV strains were identical among themselves and in relation to NS1 sequences of HBoVs from GenBank, except for a strain from China (HBoV_WLL-1) that had 1 amino acid substitution (His\u2192Arg) resulting from a mutation at nucleotide position 1328. The greatest sequence variations occurred in the VP1/VP2 gene, although the overall nucleotide and amino acid differences among different strains were <2% and <1%, respectively.",

In this 1-year prospective study, HBoV was found in NPAs from 79 children, 71 of whom had acute respiratory tract illness. Similar to previous studies, most of our patients with HBoV infection were infants or young children. Although on occasion adults have been reported to be infected with HBoV [22, 30], none of the NPAs from adults in the present study was positive for HBoV. Among patients with acute respiratory tract illness, URTI and LRTI were equally common. Although asthma exacerbations, febrile convulsions, and gastroenteritis were common associated clinical manifestations, other apparently unrelated diagnoses were also frequent. Among those patients without respiratory symptoms but with HBoV detected in NPAs, gastroenteritis was the most common diagnosis, in agreement with the detection of HBoV in fecal samples from children with gastroenteritis. In a previous study in the United States, it was found that 5 HBoV-positive children had diarrhea [14]. However, it was not known whether HBoV could be detected in their fecal samples. In the present study, HBoV was detected in 2.1% of fecal samples from children with gastroenteritis. Fever and watery diarrhea were the most common manifestations, followed by coryzal symptoms and vomiting. Similar to findings for NPAs, the affected children were young (\u2a7d3 years of age). The seasonal epidemiological profile of HBoV in fecal samples was similar to that in NPAs, with the highest incidence in fall and winter. The finding of HBoV in both respiratory and enteric specimens from humans concurs with the characteristics of the other 2 members of the genus Bocavirus, BP and MVC. BP causes diarrhea and mild respiratory symptoms in calves [31, 32]. Although MVC is associated with fetal infections and neonatal respiratory disease in dogs, the virus has occasionally been associated with enteritis [33, 34]. Further studies are required to determine the role played by HBoV in enteric disease in humans.",

Despite the large number of studies of HBoV conducted, it was not until recently that a control group of asymptomatic children was included. In this study from the United States, HBoV was identified in 22 (5.2%) of 425 samples from symptomatic children but in none from the asymptomatic control children (P = .02) [14], supporting an association between HBoV and respiratory tract illness. However, although respiratory specimens from their symptomatic children included nasal swabs, respiratory secretions, and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid sent to a hospital-based laboratory, only nasal wash specimens were obtained from asymptomatic control children at a primary care center. Because it was not indicated whether any of the HBoV-positive specimens were nasal washes, it is difficult to conclude whether the observed difference was genuine or due to discrepancies in sampling. Nevertheless, in another study, HBoV also appeared to be more common among individuals with respiratory tract disease than among those without symptoms [15]. Although the association between HBoV and respiratory tract disease may support a role for the virus in pathogenesis, it does not prove causality, which is often difficult to ascertain in the case of respiratory viruses [35].",

The frequency of codetection in HBoV-positive respiratory samples has ranged from 33% to 80%, depending on how intensively other respiratory viruses were sought, the sensitivities of the methods used, and the sampling size [12, 16\u201321]. The highest codetection rate\u2014observed in a Swiss study in which 4 of 5 HBoV-positive nasal samples from infants contained other respiratory viruses\u2014may have been due to the inclusion of a comprehensive panel of respiratory viruses that included rhinovirus and coronaviruses [16]. In the present study, although many common respiratory viruses were initially excluded from the NPAs selected for HBoV testing, 33% of the patients with NPAs positive for HBoV were subsequently found to have coinfections with another pathogen. As for fecal samples, a high rate of coinfection (56%) was also observed. It has been reported that the frequency of HBoV infection was even higher when another virus was present [15]. In the present study, a higher prevalence was also observed in NPAs positive for common respiratory viruses (6.5%) than in those that were negative (3.5%). Further studies are required to determine whether HBoV plays a causative role in these coinfections or acts as an exacerbating factor that simply increases the severity of infections caused by other pathogens.",

            "text": "The low genetic diversity of HBoV suggested that a single lineage was responsible for both respiratory tract and enteric infections in humans. This is in contrast to coronaviruses, which have different genotypes, possibly as a result of a high frequency of recombination [36]. The 5.2-kb genome of HBoV contains 3 ORFs encoding NS1 (a nonstructural protein), NP1 (a protein of unknown function), and VP1/VP2 (viral capsid protein). Phylogenetic analysis of these 3 ORFs in all 24 HBoV strains from NPAs and fecal samples did not reveal a genotypic difference between the strains from NPAs and those from fecal samples. Among the 3 genes, NS1 appeared to be the most conserved. Similar to the findings of previous studies, which mostly examined the partial NP1 gene, minor nucleotide substitutions were observed in NP1, with occasional amino acid substitutions. When HBoV was first described, it was found that most nucleotide polymorphisms occurred in VP1/VP2 [11]. Only 2 subsequent studies have analyzed partial sequences of VP1/VP2. In one study, which involved the sequencing of a 1-kb fragment of the VP2 gene, 97.5%\u2013100% nucleotide sequence identity was observed between their HBoV strains and the prototype strains, suggesting a unique lineage of HBoV [18]. In another study, which analyzed the 3\u223c 819-bp fragment of VP1/VP2, the authors suggested that 2 distinct genotypes were observed, with ST1 being in one cluster and ST2 in another [14]. In the present study, comparison of the complete VP1/VP2 gene sequences from our 24 HBoV strains and strains from other countries showed only minor variations. Although phylogenetic analysis of this gene showed that there may be clustering among some strains, the existence of distinct genotypes cannot be concluded. In fact, our present results suggest that humans are infected by a single lineage of HBoV, which was detected in both respiratory tract and enteric samples.",

This is consistent with the fact that HBoV infection occurs primarily in infants and young children. The development of immunity against HBoV and the clearance of HBoV may depend on the integrity of one's immune system. In the Swiss study [16], HBoV was detected in follow-up samples from only 1 of the 5 infants, suggesting that HBoV is rapidly cleared in most cases. In the present study, persistent HBoV shedding for >1 month was observed in both respiratory tract and fecal specimens from patients with significant underlying diseases, which may represent prolonged infections as a result of underlying immunosuppression. However, routine follow-up was not done in our patients, because our clinical data were mainly collected retrospectively after HBoV PCR results had become available, by which time most patients had been discharged. Larger longitudinal studies should be conducted to examine the duration of HBoV shedding and the mechanism of immunity.",
