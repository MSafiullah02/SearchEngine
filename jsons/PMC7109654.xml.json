Avian influenza virus H9N2/G1 and human influenza A virus 54/98 (H1N1/98) were grown in MDCK cells that contained 2 mg/L N-p-tosyl-L-phenylalaninechloromethyl ketone\u2013treated (TPCK) trypsin (Sigma). H5N1/97 virus was propagated in MDCK cells without TPCK trypsin, because these highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses are not dependent on exogenously added trypsin for productive virus replication. Virus stocks were purified by adsorption to and elution from turkey red blood cells [18] and were stored at \u221270\u00b0C until use. The titer of virus stock was determined by daily observation for cytopathic effect in MDCK cells and confirmed by hemagglutination assay [19]. To inactivate viruses, samples were irradiated at a dose of 0.2 J/cm2 for 15 min in a UV cross-linker (Spectrolinker)",

As is shown in figure 1A the expression of TNF-\u03b1 mRNA was rapidly induced by avian virus H9N2/G1 infection. It was detected at the 4-h POI and then gradually decreased over time. In contrast, TRAIL mRNA expression in H9N2/G1-infected MDMs progressively increased with time (figure 1B). At all time points assessed (the 4-, 8-, and 12-h POI), the expression level of TRAIL mRNA in H9N2/G1-infected MDMs (range, 60\u20131000 copies/104 copies of \u03b2-actin) was significantly higher than that in H1N1/98-infected MDMs (range, 10\u2013100 copies/104 copies of \u03b2-actin; n=6; P<.01).

This up-regulation of TNF-\u03b1 and TRAIL was dependent on viral replication. As is shown in figure 1D and 1E a significantly lower level of TNF-\u03b1 and TRAIL mRNA expression was detected in MDMs treated by UV-irradiated H5N1/97. The UV-irradiated H5N1/97-induced TRAIL mRNA expression was, however, significantly higher than that in mock-treated MDMs (P=.001) (figure 1E).

In the search for a specific cell line to determine the release of bioactive TRAIL by influenza virus\u2013infected MDMs, we tested the sensitivity of Jurkat T cells to recombinant DRLs. It was intriguing to find that Jurkat T cells are sensitive to TRAIL and FasL in a dose-dependent manner but not to TNF-\u03b1 (figure 2A). This specific induction of cell death by high-dose TRAIL (100 ng/mL) and FasL (100 ng/mL) could be reversed by the addition of TRAIL-R2/Fc chimera (1 \u03bcg/mL) and anti-FasL neutralizing antibody (1 \u03bcg/mL), respectively (figure 2B)",

Hence, we tested the direct cytotoxicity of virus-infected MDMs by coculturing Jurkat T cells with virus-infected MDMs for 24 h. No TPCK trypsin was added, to ensure no infection of Jurkat T cells by H1N1/98 or H9N2/G1 released from infected MDMs. The infection of cells by H5N1/97 was, however, independent of the presence of trypsin. Similar to that observed in MDM supernatant, increased apoptosis was detected in Jurkat T cells cocultured with virus-infected MDMs (figure 5). In contrast to H1N1/98- and H9N2/G1-infected MDMs, H5N1/97-infected MDMs exhibited the strongest induction of apoptosis in Jurkat T cells (figure 5C), with the percentage of active caspase\u20133\u2013positive cells at 55.30% \u00b1 13.52% (vs. H9N2/G1 at 20.75%\u00b12.12% and H1N1/98 at 20.96%\u00b13.78%; P=.0144 and P=.0485, respectively). The cytotoxic effects of H1N1/98- and H9N2/G1-infected MDMs on Jurkat T cells could be significantly inhibited by TRAIL-R2/Fc chimera but not by anti-FasL alone (figure 5A and 5B). Partial inhibition of apoptosis in Jurkat T cells cocultured with H5N1/97-infected MDMs by TRAIL-R2/Fc chimera was observed, but the difference did not yield statistical significance (figure 5C)",

According to the virus titer measured in H5N1 coculture systems (105 log10 TCID50/mL), the MOI in the coculture was only 0.2. Even when Jurkat T cells were directly infected with H5N1 at an MOI of 1, the percentage of active caspase\u20133\u2013positive cells was not very high (figure 4). Hence, there may be an increased sensitivity of Jurkat T cells in the coculture system. To test the sensitivity of infected cells to DRL-induced apoptosis, exogenous TNF-\u03b1 (500 ng/mL), TRAIL (10 ng/mL), or FasL (10 ng/mL) was added into H9N2/G1- or H5N1/97-infected Jurkat T cells, and they were incubated for 24 h. As shown in figure 6, mock-infected Jurkat T cells were resistant to the apoptosis induction effect of TNF-\u03b1, even at a high dose (500 ng/mL), and only a moderate increase in apoptosis was observed with recombinant human (rh) TRAIL and rhFasL. In contrast, a significantly enhanced level of apoptosis was detected in H5N1/97- and H9N2/G1-infected Jurkat T cells in the presence of TNF-\u03b1. A similar phenomenon was also observed with low doses of TRAIL and FasL (figure 6)",

Alternatively, various cytokines, including IFN-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b2, IFN-\u03b3, and TNF-\u03b1, can modulate the expression of TRAIL [28, 29]. In the present study, we showed that avian influenza virus H9N2/G1 and H5N1/97 significantly up-regulated the expression of TNF-\u03b1 and TRAIL, but not FasL, in MDMs (figure 1A\u20131C). Because \u223c90% of MDMs were infected at the 12-h POI, the differential expression caused by avian and human influenza viruses was not due to the difference in infectivity.

H5-subtype avian influenza virus has a characteristic cleavage-site sequence in the viral HA that renders HA susceptible to the effect of a wide spectrum of cellular proteases and permits H5N1 virus to become infectious to many tissues and organs [34]. Therefore, the sensitization to DRLs in the infected cells is probably common to many cell types in H5N1 infection and may contribute to the severe lung damage or lymphopenia observed clinically. Enhanced sensitization of virus-infected cells to apoptosis induced by TRAIL or FasL has been reported in HIV, reovirus, and respiratory syncytial virus [16, 35\u201337]. This is caused by the up-regulation of TRAIL-R2 or Fas expression in virus-infected cells that leads to enhanced TRAIL- and FasL-mediated apoptosis. Other mechanisms that are responsible for the modulation of sensitivity or resistance to DRLs include the involvement of TRAIL decoy receptors [38] and the regulation of downstream molecules such as Fas-associated death domain (FADD), caspase 8, cellular FADD-like IL-1\u03b2\u2013converting enzyme inhibitory protein, and mitochondrial factors [39]. Further study on the underlying mechanism is needed",
