Before the pandemic, our hospital was facing significant staff shortages and a large part of the medical equipment was relatively old. It should be noted that computed tomography was not available in our hospital during the period of this report. Our personnel had to be trained through fast-track courses, as previous collective experience with personal protective equipment (PPE) had been relatively limited in our country. Our personnel initially exhibited a significant degree of anxiety and tension, something totally expected in the face of a pandemic without available therapeutic guidance, not only locally but even worldwide (https://www.who.int/).",

A pandemic has been repeatedly paralleled with a war situation, where unconventional methods may need to be used to prevent huge losses, especially at the beginning of the pandemic, where minimal data are available. Besides our collective clinical experience, including the one from the HIV/AIDS epidemic, we even had discussions with senior veterinarians, who are familiar with bovine coronaviruses. Their input and pertinent literature about a relatively high rate of coinfections in syndromes caused by bovine coronaviruses did influence our practice [1]. We obviously had to combine their paradigm and approach with continuous literature review of COVID-19 treatment data, our evolving national guidelines, extreme caution for side effects and frequent audit of our practice.",
