Data on the number of infected cases, deaths, and the time of first infection report were collected and analyzed. Sixty-three days were divided into 9 wk, and we ranked all the reporting countries or territories according to the time of the first confirmed infection. In addition, changes in infections, deaths, and the case fatality rate (CFR) in all these countries or territories were also counted and calculated.",

Fifty-three percent (9/17) of them had their first case within 2 wk since January 20. Apart from Australia, these countries are mainly distributed in East Asia (China, Republic of Korea, Japan) and Southeast Asia (Singapore, Vietnam, Malaysia, Cambodia, Philippines), most are China\u2019s neighbors with a large and relatively dense population. Surprisingly, no other countries or territories in the Western Pacific Region reported their first cases of COVID 19 for nearly a month, from January 30 to February 28. However, since February 28, a total of 8 (47.0%) nations or territories have reported the first cases within 3 wk. Notably, almost all are island countries and regions (except for Mongolia), which has brought an unprecedented crisis to the prevention and control of COVID-19 in island countries or territories.",

Our previous findings suggest that the inadequate capacity to respond to public emergencies caused by an uneven distribution of medical resources is a crucial factor contributing to the unsatisfactory outcome of COVID-19 in less-developed regions.8 Compared with developed areas, countries or territories in the Western Pacific Region have insufficient health-care resources, and relatively low detection and prevention capacity.4 Although these countries or territories have just a few confirmed infected people, without adequate control and preparedness, large-scale community transmission of COVID-19 is likely to occur. Fortunately, countries such as Fiji have already started to monitor high-risk persons and strengthen the management of international borders.9 Given that COVID-19 does not have a high CFR if the medical system is not overloaded,10 it is necessary to close or strictly control the external traffic into the area and prepare adequate quarantine sites and mobile hospitals in the Western Pacific Islands to avoid a surge of patients. In addition, it is extremely important to publicize and popularize COVID-19 prevention methods, possible psychological interventions pertinent to the population exposed to the crisis, and timely disclosure of information.",

On the one hand, the special geographical environment, such as the extreme El Nino climate, makes it difficult to establish an unbreakable health system.11 Furthermore, the less-developed economy and limited management capacity present additional challenges for the population to withstand an infectious disease pandemic. Economic globalization, trade, and population mobility have exacerbated the challenges of infectious disease control. Commercial and trade facilities allow infectious diseases to quickly cross the political borders of sovereign states, leading to the global spread of diseases. Due to the discontinuity between lands in the Western Pacific Island countries and territories, the extensive networks of frequent population mobility here also facilitate the spread of infectious diseases.12,13 Previous studies have confirmed that infectious diseases depopulated isolated Pacific islands when they were first exposed to global pathogen spread.14 Fortunately, a Pacific Syndromic Surveillance System (PSSS) has been established for early warning of infectious diseases.15,16 It is an urgent need to further improve and scientifically enable this system to inhibit the spread of COVID-19 in this special period.",
