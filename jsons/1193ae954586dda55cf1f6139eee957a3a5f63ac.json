The normal initiation of eukaryotic protein synthesis is facilitated by at least 12 eukaryotic translation initiation factors (eIFs), several of which are multiprotein complexes. The largest, eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 (eIF3) (approximately 650 kDa), participates in most translation initiation processes (Asano et al., 1997a; Sonenberg et al., 2000; Kawaguchi and Bailey-Serres, 2002) . eIF3 helps to maintain the 40S and 60S ribosomal subunits in a dissociated state, and stabilizes binding of the eIF2-GTP-Met-tRNAi Met ternary complex to the 40S subunit (Chaudhuri et al., 1999; Sonenberg et al., 2000) . It promotes binding of the 43S preinitiation complex to the 5\u00a2 end of mRNA (Kolupaeva et al., 2005; Hinnebusch, 2006) . Moreover, it also plays roles in scanning for and recognizing AUG start codons (Lukaszewicz et al., 2000; Dever, 2002; Nielsen et al., 2004; Valasek et al., 2004) .",

These are conserved in mammals, Triticum aestivum (wheat), Arabidopsis thaliana, Saccharomyces pombe and Drosophila melanogaster (Asano et al., 1997b; Burks et al., 2001; Masutani et al., 2007; Zhou et al., 2008) . However, only eIF3a, eIF3b and eIF3c are found in the eIF3 core of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which has five subunits (eIF3a, eIF3b, eIF3c, eIF3g and eIF3i), indicating that eIF3e, eIF3f and eIF3h may not be necessary for global translation initiation (Asano et al., 1998; Burks et al., 2001; Zhou et al., 2005) . eIF3e and eIF3h are not essential for global translation initiation in fission yeast, but their knockout affects spore formation, indicating that they may have special roles in cell differentiation (Bandyopadhyay et al., 2000; Zhou et al., 2005; Ray et al., 2008) . eIF3f is down-regulated in many human tumours, and over-expression of eIF3f inhibits cell proliferation and induces apoptosis in tumour cells (Shi et al., 2006; Doldan et al., 2008a,b) .

As the At2g39990 protein was identified in the Arabidopsis eIF3 complex and has high similarities to the eIF3f proteins found in many species (Burks et al., 2001) , we named the gene Arabidopsis thaliana eIF3f (AteIF3f), and the mutant alleles used in this study were named ateif3f-1 and ateif3f-2. AteIF3f was highly expressed in pollen grains, pollen tubes, embryos and root tips, and was also constitutively expressed in other tissues. In a pollen rescue experiment, we found that the mutation in AteIF3f also led to defects in embryogenesis. Further transcriptome analysis using ateif3f-1 homozygous seedlings generated by pollen rescue showed that AteIF3f affected the expression of genes that are essential for pollen tube growth and embryogenesis, for example AtCSLA7 (Goubet et al., 2003) . We also demonstrated that AteIF3f interacts with Arabidopsis eIF3e and eIF3h. These results suggest that eIF3f may play important roles in plant cell growth in combination with eIF3e and eIF3h in Arabidopsis.",

We first stained the mature quartet pollen grains from ateif3f-1/+ qrt1-2/qrt1-2 plants using 4\u00a2,6-diamidino-2phenylindole (DAPI). The ateif3f-1 qrt1-2 pollen grains had two sperm nuclei and a vegetative nucleus like wild-type pollen grains and were morphologically normal.

To confirm that the ateif3f-1 mutant phenotype is caused by the Ds insertion in this gene, a 4.3 kb full-length genomic DNA fragment of At2g39990, including the promoter and 5\u00a2 and 3\u00a2 UTRs, was subcloned into the pCAMBIA1300 vector. This construct was introduced into ateif3f-1/+ plants. Transgenic lines were selected using kanamycin and hygromycin. The seeds from self-pollinated T 1 transgenic ateif3f-1/+ plants were plated on kanamycin-containing agar plates to analyse the Ds segregation ratio. Most of the transformant lines (19 of 22) showed an elevated Kan R :Kan S segregation ratio of approximately 2:1. The complemented mutant plants produced progeny that were homozygous for the ateif3f-1 mutation in T 2 and subsequent generations. When pollen grains from the two independent complemented lines homozygous for the ateif3f-1 mutation were cultured in vitro, the germination rates increased to 74.9% (187/251) and 72.3% (175/244), close to the 80.3% (203/253) germination rate for wild-type pollen grains (Figure 3a -c). These results demonstrate that the defect in gametophytic function in ateif3f-1/+ plants was fully complemented by full-length At2g39990 (AteIF3f) genomic DNA. We also examined the expression of AteIF3f in the ateif3f-1 mutant using an ateif3f-1/+ inflorescence RNA sample. The inflorescence transcriptome was mainly composed of the gametophytic transcriptome, that was contributed by 50% wild type and 50% ateif3f-1 mutant gametophytes. The realtime PCR results showed that expression of AteIF3f in the ateif3f-1/+ inflorescences was greatly reduced compared to that in wild-type plants ( Figure 3d ).

PCR analysis using a T-DNA left-border primer and a gene-specific primer confirmed that T-DNA was inserted in the 3rd exon, 954 bp downstream of the ATG in AteIF3f (Figure 2a and Figure S2 ). The mutant also carried a Kan Rselective marker. The progeny from self-pollinated ateif3f-2/ + plants also exhibited a Kan R :Kan S segregation ratio of approximately 1:1 (1132:1348), instead of 3:1. When a wildtype AteIF3f full-length genomic DNA construct was introduced into ateif3f-2/+ plants, 17 of 20 T 1 transgenic ateif3f-2/ + lines showed an increased Kan R :Kan S segregation ratio of approximately 2:1. These findings are consistent with the results obtained from the study of ateif3f-1/+ plants, and confirm that the defect in male gametophytes in ateif3f-1 is caused by a mutation in AteIF3f. AteIF3f is constitutively expressed, mostly in tissues active in cell growth and differentiation",

If the pollen function is fully complemented but the mutation causes embryonic lethality, the Kan R :Kan S segregation ratio should only increase to 1.5:1, and no ateif3f-1 homozygous plants will be generated.

In the siliques of these pollen-rescued plants, approximately 25% (151:627) of the seeds were defective (Figure 6a ,c) compared to seeds from wild-type siliques (Figure 6b ,d). The abnormal embryos stopped developing and started to degrade at various stages in different pollen-rescued lines. We randomly selected four transgenic lines, two from each construct, for further observation. In one transgenic line, the abnormal embryo stopped developing at the early globular stage ( Figure 6e ) and started to degrade when the normal embryos in the same silique were at the transition (globular to heart) stage ( Figure 6f ). In the other two transgenic lines, the mutant embryos developed to the late globular stage but were inflated and abnormal (Figure 6g ), while the normal embryos in the same silique had developed to the torpedo stage (Figure 6h) . In a few cases, the abnormal embryo survived (Figure 6i ) until the normal embryos matured (Figure 6j ). Some of the defective embryos developed into mature seeds and gave rise to seedlings on regular MS medium (Figure 7a ). These seedlings had malformations in body shape, lacked chlorophyll and had abnormal anthocyanin accumulation, suggesting that their cell division and plastid differentiation processes were affected. Sometimes they even lacked hypocotyls and cotyledons (Figure 7b-d) , and their root cell structure was severely disordered and disperse (Figure 7e) . A PCR assay using DNA from the defective ateif3f-1 seedlings indicated that they were homozygous for the ateif3f-1 mutation. Real-time PCR and RT-PCR assays using RNA extracted from ateif3f-1 homozygous seedlings showed that expression of AteIF3f was dramatically lower in such seedlings (Figure 7f,g) . Transgenic wild-type plants with either pLAT52:AteIF3f cDNA or pVGD1:AteIF3f cDNA construct were also examined as negative controls. No defective embryos were found in these transgenic plants. Therefore, we conclude that the mutation in ateif3f-1 leads to the embryo defect.",

To determine whether this was related to sugar responses, ateif3f-1 seeds with the pollen-rescuing construct were germinated on MS agar plates containing 0%, 1%, 2%, 4% or 6% (W/V) sucrose. After culturing for 6 days under light, the ateif3f-1 homozygous seedlings exhibited a sugar-sensitive phenotype, and grew best on medium without sucrose. Increasing sucrose concentrations may alter anthocyanin accumulation and repress chlorophyll synthesis (Figure 9a ). Replacement of sucrose with glucose and maltose yielded similar results. When mannitol was substituted, however, the ateif3f-1 homozygous seedlings synthesized chlorophyll at a similar level to that seen on the medium without any sugar (Figure 9b ). This sugarsensitive phenotype is similar to the phenotype of eif3h-1 seedlings previously reported (Kim et al., 2004) . To compare the ateif3f-1 mutant with mutants for Arabidopsis eIF3e, eif3e-1 (FLAG_495E05) was selected from the seed stocks of the Arabidopsis thaliana Resource Centre (ARC) at the Versailles Genetics and Plant Breeding Laboratory (INRA, Paris, France). In eif3e-1, a T-DNA is inserted in the 4th intron, in the middle of the eIF3e gene. The T-DNA insertion also carries the Kan R -selective marker. No eif3e-1 homozygous mutant plants were identified in the progeny. When an eif3e-1/+ plant was self-crossed, the Kan R :Kan S segregation ratio in the resulting progeny was approximately 0.73:1 (428:586) instead of the typical 3:1. When cultured in vitro, only 38.7% (210/543) of the pollen grains from eif3e-1/+ plants germinated, compared to 78.8% (349/ 443) of the pollen grains from wild-type plants under the same conditions. These results showed that the mutation in the eIF3e gene also affects pollen germination, consistent with the results reported previously (Yahalom et al., 2008) . Therefore, the ateif3f mutant has similar phenotypes to those of eif3e and eif3h mutants in Arabidopsis.",

In transformed tobacco leaf cells, YFP fluorescence was detected in the cytoplasm when AteIF3f-YN and eIF3e-YC or AteIF3f-YN and eIF3h-YC were co-expressed (Figure 11a,b) . No obvious fluorescent signal was detected by the expression of either AteIF3f-YN, eIF3e-YC or eIF3h-YC alone (Figure 11c-f ).

            "text": "In mammals, the subunit eIF3f is not essential for global translation initiation, but it has a wide range of roles in normal cell growth. For instance, eIF3f plays a central role in both the atrophic and the hypertrophic pathways in muscle cells. Genetic blockade of eIF3f expression induced atrophy. On the other hand, genetic activation of eIF3f promoted structural muscle protein synthesis and led to muscle hypertrophy (Csibi et al., 2008) . However, the roles of eIF3f in plant cells remain unknown. In this study, we found that a mutation in AteIF3f severely affected pollen germination and embryogenesis, providing evidence for an important role of AteIF3f in plant species. Transcriptome analysis of ateif3f-1 homozygous seedlings showed that lack of AteIF3f significantly altered the expression of more than 3000 genes, many of which are important development-related genes, for example AtCSLA7. We verified that the expression of AtC-SLA7 was truly down-regulated in the mutant using real-time PCR. The expression of AtCSLA7 was reduced to about 7% of the wild-type level in homozygous ateif3f-1 mutant seedlings (Figure 8a) . AtCSLA7 belongs to a subfamily of cellulose synthase-like (CLS) genes that are involved in biosynthesis of the plant cell wall. Mutation in AtCSLA7 affected pollen tube growth and led to seed lethality (Goubet et al., 2003) . The microarray data also showed that ASN1, SCO1, AtNAP7 and CAO were significantly down-regulated in the mutant seedlings. The expression level of SCO1 was reduced to 14% of the wildtype level in homozygous ateif3f-1 seedlings. Mutant sco1 (snowy cotyledon1) embryos produce undifferentiated proplastids, resulting in defects in greening of the cotyledons of sco1 seedlings (Albrecht et al., 2006) . The expression level of AtNAP1 was reduced to 31% of the wild-type level in the ateif3f-1 homozygous seedlings. The AtNAP7 protein is localized in the plastid. Mutation of AtNAP7 led to embryonic lethality at the globular stage. The atnap7 mutant contained abnormally developing plastids with disorganized thylakoid structures (Xu and Moller, 2004) . Expression of the chlorophyllide a oxygenase (CAO) gene, which regulates chlorophyll b synthesis, was reduced to 2.5% of the wildtype level in homozygous ateif3f-1 seedlings (Espineda et al., 1999; Yamasato et al., 2008) . In summary, these results imply that AtelF3f plays important roles in plant cell development, possibly by regulating the expression of genes important for normal pollen tube growth, embryo development, plastid differentiation and chlorophyll synthesis.",

The ateif3f-1 mutant was hypersensitive to exogenous sucrose, similar to the eif3h-1 mutant (Kim et al., 2004 (Kim et al., , 2007 . It has been reported that eIF3h is involved in translational initiation of transcription factor ATB2/AtbZIP11 mRNA (Kim et al., 2004 (Kim et al., , 2007 . Previous studies proposed that ASN1 and ProDH2 were two direct targets of transcription factor ATB2/AtbZIP11 in Arabidopsis (Hanson et al., 2008) and the translation of AtbZIP11 mRNA was repressed by sucrose (Rook et al., 1998; Wiese et al., 2004) . Our microarray, realtime PCR and RT-PCR analyses all showed that the expression level of ASN1, the direct target of AtbZIP11, was drastically reduced in ateif3f-1 homozygous seedlings (Figure 8c,d) (Hanson et al., 2008) . The microarray assay showed that expression of AtbZIP11 at the transcriptional level was not reduced in ateif3f-1 homozygous seedlings compared to wild-type seedlings. Thus, the ateif3f-1 mutation did not affect the transcription of AtbZIP11 mRNA. However, we still lack direct protein evidence for the effect of the ateif3f-1 mutation on AtbZIP11 mRNA translation due to a lack of ateif3f-1 homozygous materials for protein preparation. Nevertheless, our results at least provide a clue that AtelF3f may affect the function of AtbZIP11 in expression of ASN1.",

This assumption is consistent with the ateif3f-1 mutant phenotypes observed in this study. For instance, the pollen tube growth of ateif3f-1 was inhibited. In the pollen-rescued mutant lines, the ateif3f-1 homozygous embryos were defective in organogenesis. Cotyledon and root formation were severely affected in some ateif3f-1 homozygous seedlings.

            "text": "In this study, we demonstrated that AteIF3f interacts with both Arabidopsis eIF3e and eIF3h in Y2H and BiFC assays. Although the interaction partners of eIF3f are less well known in plant cells, several binding partners and a potential binding site of eIF3f have been identified in humans and yeast. For example, eIF3f is involved in apoptosis by interacting with cyclin-dependent kinase 11 (CDK11), which is an important effector in apoptosis (Shi et al., 2003 (Shi et al., , 2009 . Additionally, eIF3f interacts with coronavirus spike protein to inhibit host cell translation (Xiao et al., 2008) . eIF3f has also been reported to be a key target of the muscle-specific E3 ubiquitin ligase MAFbx/Atrogin-1 for ubiquitination and degradation by the proteasome during muscle atrophy (Csibi et al., 2008) . A possible binding site for mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) and S6K1 was found in the eIF3f subunit in mammals and yeast (Hinnebusch, 2006) . The studies showed that the TOR signalling network regulates the translation and transcription of ribosomal components, and revealed that S6K1 phosphorylates several targets related to translation. eIF3f mediates the association between the eIF3 complex and mTOR or S6K1, which switch the eIF3 complex on and off (Holz et al., 2005; Harris et al., 2006) . These results imply the existence of many potential binding partners for AteIF3f in Arabidopsis.",
