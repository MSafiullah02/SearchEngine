            "text": "The high morbidity associated with SARS was highlighted by the observation that even when only 12 % of the total lung fi eld is involved by consolidation on chest radiographs, 50 % of patients require supplemental oxygen to maintain satisfactory oxygenation above 90 % [ 10 ] . Peiris et al. [ 9 ] showed peaking of the nasopharyngeal viral load on day 10 of illness followed by a progressive decrease in rates of viral shedding from the nasopharynx, in stool, and in urine from day 10 to day 21 after symptom onset in 20 patients who had serial measurements with reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Thus, clinical worsening of patients with SARS during phase 2 (second week of illness) is most likely the result of immunemediated lung injury due to an overexuberant host response rather than uncontrolled viral replication [ 9 ] . SARS spreads mainly by close person-to-person contact via droplet transmission or fomite [ 11 ] . During the global outbreak of SARS, about 20 % of patients progressed into acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), necessitating invasive ventilatory support while reaching a very high viral load at the nasopharynx with the peak on day 10 of illness [ 9 ] . Thus, HCWs were particularly prone to infection while caring for patients at a close distance [ 1 , 9 , 12 ] . These data emphasize the need for adequate respiratory protection in addition to strict contact and droplet precautions when managing patients with pneumonia due to highly infectious diseases.",

            "text": "Several uncontrolled studies have shown that single-circuit noninvasive ventilation (NIV) can be life-saving for patients in respiratory failure due to SARS infection [ 13 -15 ] . Among 120 patients meeting clinical criteria for SARS who were in a hospital for infectious diseases in Beijing, 30 (25 %) had developed acute respiratory failure (ARF) at 10.7 \u00b1 3.8 days after the onset of SARS. Among these 30 patients, 16 (53 %) exhibited hypercapnia (PaCO 2 > 45 mmHg), and 10 hypercapnic events occurred within 1 week of admission. NIV was instituted in 28 patients, with 1 patient intolerant of it. In the remaining 27 patients with SARS, NIV was initiated 1.2 \u00b1 1.6 days after ARF onset. An hour of NIV therapy led to signifi cant improvement in PaO 2 /FiO 2 and a reduced respiratory rate ( p < 0.01). Endotracheal intubation was required in one-third of the patients (9/27) despite a favorable response to NIV initially. Remarkable pulmonary barotrauma was noted in 7 of the 120 patients (5.8 %) and in 6 of those (22 %) on NIV. The overall fatality rate at 13 weeks was 6.7 % (8/120). It was higher (26.7 %) among those needing NIV. None of the HCWs contracted SARS. The authors concluded that NIV is a feasible, appropriate treatment for ARF due to SARS infection [ 13 ] . In another study, NIV was applied via oronasal mask to 20 SARS patients without chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who had developed severe hypoxemic respiratory failure in a hospital in Hong Kong with effi cient room air exchange (through timely installation of powerful exhaust fans to provide 8-12 air changes per hour), stringent infection control measures, full personal protective equipment (PPE), and addition of a viral/bacterial fi lter to the exhalation port of the NIV device. The mean age of the patients was 51.4 years. The mean Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score was 5.35. SARS CoV serology was positive in 19 of 20 patients (95 %). NIV was started at a mean of 9.6 days from symptom onset. The mean duration of NIV usage was 84.3 h. Endotracheal intubation was avoided in 14 patients (70 %), in whom the ICU stay was shorter than those who required intubation (3.1 vs. 21.3 days, p < 0.001), and the chest radiography score within 24 h of NIV was lower (15.1 vs. 22.5, p = 0.005) compared to the intubated patients. Intubation avoidance was predicted by a marked reduction in respiratory rate (9.2 breaths per min) and supplemental oxygen requirement (3.1 L/min) within 24 h of NIV. There were no clinical infections among the 105 HCWs caring for the 20 patients receiving NIV, and 102 HCWs who had consented to blood serology testing were all negative for SARS CoV. NIV appeared effective in the treatment of ARF in the patients with SARS, and its use was safe for HCWs in this single-center study [ 14 ] .",

Intubation rate, mortality, and secondary outcome of a hospital utilizing NIV under standard infection control conditions (the same NIV hospital as described above [ 14 ] ) were compared to 13 other hospitals using only invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV hospitals) [ 15 ] . The two hospital groups had comparable demographics and clinical profi les, but patients at the NIV hospital ( n = 42) had higher lactate dehydrogenase levels and worse radiographic scores on admission. Compared to the IMV hospitals ( n = 451), the NIV hospital had lower adjusted odds ratios (OR) for intubation [0.36, 95 % confi dence interval (CI) 0.164-0.791, p = 0.011] and death (0.235, 95 % CI 0.077-0.716, p = 0.011). There was no clinical transmission of SARS among HCWs caused by the use of NIV. Compared to IMV, NIV as the initial ventilatory support for ARF in the presence of SARS appeared to be safe. Also, it is associated with a reduced need for IMV and low mortality in this study [ 15 ] .",

Other risk factors included involvement in patient resuscitation and IMV [ 16 ] . The relative risk of developing SARS was 13-fold for HCWs in Toronto who were involved in intubating SARS patients versus those who were not. In contrast, NIV was not associated with a statistically signifi cant risk for the HCWs (1/6 exposed HCWs vs. 2/28 nonexposed, risk ratio 2.33, p = 0.5) [ 17 ] . This was probably because tracheal suctioning was not generally performed for patients ventilated with NIV, and the study sample size was small [ 17 ] .

Experimental studies based on a sophisticated human patient simulator and laser visualization technique have shown that the maximum exhaled air particle dispersion distance from patients receiving NIV via the ResMed Ultra Mirage mask was about 0.5 m along the exhalation port [ 22 ] . The same research group demonstrated that the maximum exhaled air dispersion distance from the Respironics ComfortFull 2 mask was about 1 m at a predictable direction from the exhalation diffuser perpendicular to the patient. Leakage though the Respironics Image 3 mask, connected to the whisper swivel exhalation port, was much more extensive and diffuse even at a low IPAP of 10 cmH 2 O [ 23 ] . The whisper swivel is an effi cient exhalation device to prevent carbon dioxide rebreathing, but it is not advisable to use such an exhalation port when managing patients with highly infectious conditions such as SARS for fear of causing major nosocomial infection. It is also important to avoid the use of high IPAP, which could lead to wider distribution of [ 15 , 26 ] Staff education (a) Limit opportunities for exposure: limit aerosol generating procedures and limit number of HCWs present. (b) Effective use of time during patient contact. (c) How to \"gown up\" and \"gown down\" without contamination. exhaled air and substantial room contamination [ 23 ] . These data have important clinical implications regarding the prevention of any future nosocomial outbreaks of SARS and other highly infectious conditions such as pandemic infl uenza. Noninvasive ventilation should be applied in patients with severe CAP only if there is adequate protection for HCWs because of the potential risk of transmission. The organisms can spread via either deliberate or accidental mask interface leakage and fl ow compensation causing dispersion of contaminated aerosol [ 24 ] . In patients with respiratory failure undergoing NIV via nasal masks, air leakage may occur through the mouth or routes other than the exhalation valve [ 25 ] . For example, the patient may loosen the mask strap to relieve discomfort around the nasal bridge, and air leakage from the nasal bridge is defi nitely a potential source for transmission of viral infection. Careful mask fi tting is important for successful, safe application of NIV [ 24 ] . Addition of a viral/bacterial fi lter to the breathing system of NIV between the mask and the exhalation port [ 13 -15 ] or using dual-circuit NIV may reduce the risk of nosocomial transmission of viral infection [ 22 ] .",

Indeed, SARS-related ARF has been reported to respond readily to low positive pressures with CPAP (4-10 cmH 2 O), IPAP (<10 cmH 2 O), and EPAP of (4-6 cmH 2 O) [ 26 ] . Higher pressures should be avoided because of the common fi ndings of spontaneous pneumomediastinum and pneumothorax in SARS [ 1 , 10 , 12 ] .",

            "text": "During the 2009 pandemic of infl uenza A(H1N1)pdm09 infections, it was recommended that NIV be applied to suitable patients (e.g., those with mild to moderate acute hypercapnic respiratory failure or acute pulmonary edema or those with resolving ARDS) via a helmet mask with double-circuit tubes or a total fullface mask with fi lters and avoidance of heated humidifi cation. This was in addition to prudent isolation of the patients coupled with protective measures for the HCWs and other patients (Table 13. 2 ) [ 27 ] . The Health Protection Agency, UK, has recommended airborne precaution when applying NIV in patients with the H1N1pdm09 infection [ 28 ] . Also, the most recent World Health Organization (WHO) interim guidance on management of the novel CoV has also recommended the use of NIV for mild cases of ARDS without hemodynamic instability [ 29 ] . The WHO interim guidelines on prevention and control of acute respiratory diseases in health care has included NIV among those aerosol-generating procedures in which there is possibly increased risk of respiratory pathogen transmission. In addition to maintaining contact, droplet, and standard precautions among HCWs when providing routine care to such patients, the WHO recommends full PPE for the HCW, covering the torso, arms, eyes, nose, and mouth. It includes a long-sleeved gown, single-use gloves, eye protection, and an N95 mask or equivalent as the minimum level of respiratory protection. NIV should be provided in an adequately ventilated single room. There should also be an expiratory port with a bacterial/viral fi lter that reduces aerosol emission [ 30 ] .",

More research is also needed regarding technical improvements of the NIV masks and viral/bacterial fi lters, as well as in the design of a safer hospital ward environment, to prevent nosocomial transmission of these infections.

(e) No pens, paper, other personal items, or medical records allowed into or removed from the room. (f) Immediate removal of grossly contaminated PPE and showering in nearby facility. Environment / equipment (a) Conform to CDC recommendation for environmental control of tuberculosis: minimum 6 air changes per hour (ACHs). Where feasible, increase to 12 ACHs or recirculate air through HEPA fi lter. (b) Preferred: negative pressure isolation rooms with antechambers, with doors closed at all times. (c) Equipment not be shared among patients. (d) Alcohol-based hand and equipment disinfectants. (e) Gloves, gowns, masks, and disposal units readily available. (f) Careful, frequent cleaning of surfaces with disposable cloths and alcohol-based detergents. (g) Use of video camera equipment or windows to monitor patients. Transport Avoid patient transport where possible. Balance risks and benefi ts of investigations that necessitate patient transport. Special precautions for ICU (a) Viral/bacterial fi lter placed in expiratory port of bag-valve mask. (b) Two fi lters per ventilator: between expiratory port and the ventilator; another on the exhalation outlet of the ventilator. (c) Closed system in-line suctioning of endotracheal/tracheostomy tubes. (d) Heat and moisture exchanger (HME) preferred to heated humidifi er. Careful handling of contaminated HME. (e) Scavenger system for exhalation port of ventilator. Optional if negative pressure with high air exchange (>12/h) is achieved.",
