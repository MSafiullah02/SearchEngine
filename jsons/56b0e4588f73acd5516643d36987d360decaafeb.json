This low concentration of HPNPP was chosen so that HPNPP cleavage could be completed within a reasonable timeframe. The initial rates of HPNPP cleavage was measured directly following the addition of each aliquot of HPNPP (black data points) and again after completion of the hydrolysis (after 48 h, grey data points). After each successive addition of HPNPP, it can be seen that the system is successfully reactivated, though not to the same reaction rate. The reduced reaction rate following successive additions is due to the ability of the waste product to also bind to the surface of the self-assembled catalysts, thereby acting as a competitive inhibitor.",

Either 2 or 5 \u00b5M of Nile red is used in the experiments, which may seem too high to be 'probing. ' We have attempted to use concentrations of Nile red that are much lower but found that with concentrations of Nile red lower than 2 uM, the system becomes too insensitive and the data unreliable. We have also compared the cac's obtained with 2 or 5 \u00b5M of Nile red and have found them to be within experimental error (see below), though the profiles of the curves can vary, meaning that one of the concentrations can be easier to interpret. We believe the 'actual' concentration of Nile red in solution is much lower than 2 or 5 \u00b5M, as during the experiment, the Nile red can be seen accumulated on the cuvette cap, as its solubility in water is so low. However, using concentrations of Nile red below 2 \u00b5M gives poor data, possibly due to the slow kinetics of dissolution of the Nile red from the hydrophobic cap of the cuvette. Comparison of the cac's obtained with the fluorescent probe against the concentrations of catalyst where we begin to observe onset of catalysis shows that these data match closely (i.e. matching the data obtained in Figures 2b and   3b ). We therefore believe that the Nile red is not having a major impact on the self-assembly of the amphiphiles. We found no significant differences in cac from using 5 mM or 10 mM HEPES. Slight differences in the cac observed were within experimental error (see below). ",

S18 (f) Experimental procedure related to Figure 4b. This experiment was performed to demonstrate the Michaelis-Menten characteristics of this system and required the addition of increasing concentrations of substrate HPNPP in order to approach Vmax. Because the concentration of substrate HPNPP needed was high (up to 3 mM), we required higher concentrations of buffer to ensure that the buffer capacity was not breached, thus the reason for using [HEPES buffer] = 50 mM. Conditions: ([CnTACN\u00b7Zn 2+ ] = 50 \u00b5M, [HEPES buffer] = 50 mM, pH 7.0), T = 40 \u00b0C; absorbance measured at 405 nm. Initial rates (v0) were calculated by converting the absorbance signals into concentration using the \u03b5\u00b7l calculated from a calibration curve. Michaelis-Menten parameters were then determined by fitting the corresponding saturation profile with the Michaelis-Menten model (Origin 8 Pro, function: Hill; constraints: n = 1, i.e. Michaelis-Menten kinetics).",
