So far, 42 638 people have been diagnosed as 2019-nCoV pneumonia, which also known as Wuhan pneumonia, among them, 7333 are severe cases, 1016 patients died, and only 3996 patients have been cured in the mainland of China (Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan were excluded). 1 All 31 provincial-level regions and the Xinjiang Production Corps have the confirmed cases. 1 Hubei province, where believed to be the origin of Wuhan pneumonia outbreak, suffers the most, with 31 728 confirmed cases and 974 death cases. 2 The trend of cumulative cases is soaring, including 24 other countries outside of China had confirmed cases. With a remarkable notice that the total number of cases has far exceeded the number during severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) period. The first case of 2019-nCoV pneumonia was linked to wild animal trading in the Huanan seafood market in the city of Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province. 3 Zhou et al 4 found the initial source of 2019-nCoV probably originated from the Chinese horseshoe bat since the novel coronavirus was 96% identical to a bat coronavirus at a whole genome level. This coronavirus, which has not been identified in humans previously, had been detected from patients in Coronaviruses are a huge family of viruses, of which severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-nCoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-nCoV), and so on have already known by humans. 8 The 2019-nCoV has an incubation period of 3 to 7 days in general, with a maximum of 14 days. 9 The most common symptoms at the onset of illness are fever, cough, and myalgia or fatigue. 9,10 While a few patients might have stuffiness, pharyngalgia, or diarrhea. 9 By far, the main sources of infection are 2019-nCoV infected humans, however, the asymptomatic infection might also be a source of infection. 9 These patients are not easy to be detected among the population when initially infected but might have headache, fever, dyspnea, fatigue, and so on later. 11 This type of coronavirus has been proved could spread from person to person through the respiratory tract and contact transmission. 9 be similar of SARS. 14 Mild and occult cases could be the major concerns for disease prevention. 15, 16 The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends wearing a medical mask when leaving homes 17 and ethanol and the high temperature had been proved could prevent disease occurrence. 9 The event has been determined as a Public", "cite_spans": [{"start": 355, "end": 356, "text": "1", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 449, "end": 450, "text": "1", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 595, "end": 596, "text": "2", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 1000, "end": 1001, "text": "3", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1514, "end": 1515, "text": "8", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1609, "end": 1610, "text": "9", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1778, "end": 1779, "text": "9", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1922, "end": 1923, "text": "9", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 2079, "end": 2081, "text": "11", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 2214, "end": 2215, "text": "9", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 2313, "end": 2316, "text": "15,", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 2317, "end": 2319, "text": "16", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 2409, "end": 2411, "text": "17", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 2499, "end": 2500, "text": "9", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "Health Emergency of International Concern by WHO. 18 Humans are generally susceptible to coronavirus. 9 The youngest infected patient is only 1 month after birth. 19 Death cases were mostly found in the elderly and who already have chronic conditions. 10, 20 The confirmed case is defined as either positive of novel coronavirus nucleic acid by real-time fluorescent reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction detection of respiratory or blood specimens or highly homologous to any known novel coronaviruses through virus gene sequencing of respiratory or blood specimens.
