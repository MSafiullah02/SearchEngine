According to the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC), approximately 150 000 to 450 000 cases were reported annually within the period 2005 to 2014 [2]. Although there have been an improvement in the quality of water and sanitation, shigellosis remains a major public health problem in several developing countries, including China [3, 4].",

Humans are the only natural host for Shigella spp.. In recent years, numerous reports have demonstrated that the incidence of shigellosis within males is higher than that within females [6\u20138]. The incidence of shigellosis, a water/food born disease, is directly related to the hygiene behaviours such as regular hand washing [9]. A study has indicated that the sanitary state in females is always higher than that in males [10]. Does this mean that the transmission features differ between male and female? A study has reported that shigellosis primarily occurs from person-to-person [1]. Thus, the water/food-to-person route has been interrupted. Moreover, many studies have indicated different incidences in individuals of various ages [1, 8, 11]. In this study, we aimed to explore the interpersonal transmission further.",

However, it did not estimate the transmissibility of bacillary dysentery between males and females. Considering that water makes less of a contribution in the transmission, a sex-based Susceptible\u2013Exposed\u2013Infectious/Asymptomatic\u2013Recovered (SEIAR) model was applied to explore the dataset from Hubei Province. The secondary attack rate (SAR), which is defined as the probability of an infected person infecting a susceptible person during his or her entire infectious period, was adopted to assess the relative transmissibility of shigellosis between males and females. In this study, shigellosis cases reported in Hubei Province, China, were collected. The SEIAR model was applied to fit the data, calculate the related index, and determine the transmissibility of shigellosis between males and females. With the aim of exploring the transmission features in different gender and age groups, the SEIAR model was adopted to fit the data of shigellosis cases reported from 2005 to 2017 in Hubei Province, China.",

The natural birth rate is br and the natural mortality rate is dr.According to a new review [1], the transmission of shigellosis mainly occurs from person-to-person. Meanwhile, our pilot study indicated a minor contribution of water/food (Additional file 1). Therefore, we assumed that the water/food to person transmission route had been cut off.The (1-p) E (0 \u2264 p \u2264 1) number of exposed individuals will change to infected person I following an incubation period, while a further pE number of exposed individuals will become asymptomatic person A following a latent period (the period during which the exposed individuals become an asymptomatic person).The removal speed from I and A is positively proportional to the number of people in both groups, and the proportional coefficients are \u03b3 and \u03b3\u2019, respectively, whereas 1/\u03b3 and 1/\u03b3\u2019 are the infectious period of I and A.The infected person will die as a result of the disease and the case fatality rate is f.",

Oster, University of California, Berkeley, CA) was employed for the model simulation. The simulation methods were as previously described [17, 29\u201332]. According to our previous published studies [33, 34], we assumed that heterogeneity of the transmissibility existed during an ascending trend and a descending trend. The annual data were therefore divided into numerous parts and the simulated time step was a day; for example, the data of 2010 were divided into 13 parts (Fig. 5). The Runge-Kutta method of order 4 with the tolerance set at 0.001 was used for model building. Berkeley Madonna minimized the root mean square during the curve fitting process. Microsoft Office Excel 2016 (Microsoft, Redmond, WA, USA) and GraphPad Prism 7.0 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA) were employed for the figure development and data analysis. Moreover, SPSS 21.0 (IBM Corp, Armonk, NY, USA) was used to calculate the coefficient of determination (R2) by curve fitting, which was adopted to judge the model goodness of fit.\n",

Our results demonstrated that the mean values of the transmission parameters among males and females, from male to female, and from female to male are differed, with the following order: \u03b2fm > \u03b2mm > \u03b2mf > \u03b2ff. The median values of the SAR exhibited the following order: SARfm > SARmf > SARmm > SARff. Because a model of the total population in Hubei was constructed, the value of SAR was small and within the neighborhood of zero. However, this did not affect the quantification of the transmissibility of shigellosis. A previous study indicated a high incidence in MSM in developed countries owing to unprotected sex and oro-anal contact [1]. However, the proportion of MSM in China is not large. This finding may be related to the fact that the contact rate between males and females, such as kissing, embracing, and shaking hands, is higher than within genders. The results indicate that the most significant transmission route is from female to male. Superior hygiene behaviours may be responsible for the lower female than male incidences. The greatest reason that males are more susceptible than females may be related to superior lifestyle habits, such as hand washing, in female individuals than in males. Moreover, females generally carry out more tasks such as cooking in the home. This finding suggests the importance of emphasizing the importance of washing hands before cooking for females.",

There is no doubt that children have a relatively high susceptibility compared to other ages. Furthermore, it is apparent that children often exhibit poor habits such as not washing their hands after using the toilet or before meals. Our results demonstrate that the main transmission route is from the elderly to children. There is a custom in China whereby young parents leave their children in the grandparents\u2019 care. This suggests that the most important intervention may be the need to cut off transmission from the elderly. According to the epidemic characteristics of bacterial dysentery, control measures could be implemented in terms of following aspects:\nFocus on females cooking in the home and grandparents caring for grandchildren, such as advocating hand washing.Encourage effective hygiene habits to reduce the susceptibility of male individuals and children.Reduce the frequency of social behaviour such as kissing, embracing and shaking hands.",
