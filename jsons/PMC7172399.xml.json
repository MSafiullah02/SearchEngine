            "text": "\nSalmonella phage P22 is a dsDNA phage of the Podoviridae family, which is characterised by a short base plate or tail structure incorporated into one of the 12 5-fold vertices of the icosahedral phage head (Poteete, 1994; Figure 1). Its scaffolding protein assisted assembly pathway proceeds though a DNA-free procapsid structure Earnshaw and Casjens 1980, Casjens and Hendrix 1988. The structure of the scaffolding-containing procapsid, an empty procapsid, and the mature capsid with T = 7 laevo, analysed by cryo-electronmicroscopy at 22, 28 and 28 \u00c5 resolution, respectively, revealed a marked structural transition during DNA packing Prasad et al 1993, Thuman-Commike et al 1996. The formation of the short tail is initiated by incorporation of the portal protein 12-mer into one vertex of the procapsid during procapsid assembly together with 10 to 20 copies of each of three pilot proteins, gp7, gp16 and gp20 (Bazinet et al., 1988). The pilot proteins and the portal complex are required for infectivity but not for procapsid assembly (Botstein et al., 1973). Upon DNA packaging, proteins gp4, gp10 and gp26 are attached, forming the slender neck structure of the base plate. The portal vertex is both the site of DNA entry during phage maturation and DNA exit during infection. In the very last step of phage assembly tailspikes are attached to the neck structure. The tailspike protein, a homotrimer of 72 kDa subunits is anchored by its N-terminal, head-binding domain in a non-covalent but irreversible manner Berget and Poteete 1980, Maurides et al 1990. Three tailspikes are required on average to form an infectious phage (Israel, 1978).",

The distribution of the O-antigen chain length was reported to be unequal in S. typhimurium with 77% having between 19 and 34 repeating units, but two thirds of all LPS molecules being devoid of O side-chains (Palva & M\u00e4kel\u00e4, 1980).

Phasing was based on a strong telluromethionine derivative and a weak uranium derivative (Table 1). The incorporation of the amino acid analogues l-selenomethionine and l-telluromethionine into proteins overexpressed by recombinant DNA technology using Met auxotrophic E. coli strains opened the possibility to produce heavy atom derivatives of protein crystals on a rational basis. While use of synchrotron radiation is essential to take advantage of the anomalous contribution of selenium by MAD phasing (Hendrickson, 1991) in Met(Se)-derivatives, Met(Te)-derivatives show good phasing with CuK\u03b1-radiation due to the larger number of additional electrons. The incorporation of the tellurium analogue Met(Te) was hampered by the lack of an efficient chemical synthesis and mainly by its very limited stability under aqueous, aerobic conditions as in E. coli cultures. N-acetyltelluromethionine and its Te-hydroxylated form, Ac-dl-Met(Te)-OH rapidly formed under aerobic conditions, were demonstrated to have a significantly increased stability. Ac-dl-Met(Te) has a half-life of about 20 hours compared to 30 minutes for free l-Met(Te) in non-degassed aqueous solution at pH 7.0 and room temperature, which is sufficient for bioincorporation (Karnbrock et al., 1996). Both compounds can be used directly for efficient high level incorporation of Met(Te) residues as demonstrated for a variety of proteins (Budisa et al., 1995; and unpublished results). Met(Te) residues are stable when they are buried in the interior of the protein.",

The N-terminal three-helix bundle from residues 113 to 120 present at the mouth segment of the C-terminal fragment was chosen as an overlapping segment in the construction of the expression vector for the head-binding domain. It is stabilised by hydrophobic interactions between aromatic and aliphatic residues and was therefore expected to be ordered in the N-terminal fragment as well. Although the absence of electron density for residues 109 to 124 in the N-terminal fragment could be due to complete disorder of this part, it could also be explained by mobility of the stable three-helix bundle with respect to the compact head-binding domain. Simple docking experiments between both fragments show that the three-helix bundle cannot penetrate the N-terminal dome very deeply and therefore only few direct contacts between both fragments are possible. This is suggestive of a hinge function of the connecting part between both fragments, which might be necessary either to deal with shearing forces on the exposed 150 \u00c5 long molecule or might have a functional role during the infection process, allowing the tailspikes to bend away from the DNA injection apparatus.",

However, the terminal rhamnose fits the electron density best in a twisted boat conformation, which is often observed for carbohydrates bound to the active site of a glycosidase. The C1 hydroxyl group is clearly present in \u03b1-configuration, as in the substrate. It is hydrogen-bonded to Asp392 with a distance of 2.7 \u00c5.

This water molecule is H-bonded to Glu359, Ser360 and Asp395 with distances of 2.7, 2.6 and 2.8 \u00c5, respectively. In addition, Glu359 forms a salt bridge with Lys363. Residue Trp391 contributes to the binding of the terminal rhamnose by a hydrophobic contact to the 6-methyl group and it additionally may influence the hydrophobicity in the environment of Asp392, which probably serves as general acid (Figure 11).

The distance between both is assumed to be a valuable indicator of the enzymatic mechanism, as average distances are about 4.5 to 5.5 \u00c5 and 9.0 to 10.0 \u00c5 for retaining and inverting endoglycosidases, respectively. The larger distance for inverting enzymes originates from the necessity to harbour both the substrate and a catalytic water molecule between the general acid and the general base McCarter and Withers 1994, Davies and Henrissat 1995. The active site topology of the tailspike protein shows distances of 5.8 \u00c5 (Asp392, Asp395), 8.2 \u00c5 (Asp392, Glu359) and 7.1 \u00c5 (Asp395, Glu359). The distance of 5.8 \u00c5 between Asp392 and Asp395 is comparable to the distance range observed for retaining enzymes. In that case Asp395 would serve as nucleophile and attack the anomeric C-atom. The distance of 4.0 \u00c5 between the anomeric C-atom of Rha I and Asp395 would make a different binding mode for the substrate necessary, with a disruption of the hydrophobic contact of the 6-methyl group to Trp391. Taking into account the precise location of the extended product in the binding cleft, it is likely that substrate and product bind similarly. However, even if Asp395 would serve as a nucleophile, no acidic residue is present on the opposite side of the carbohydrate to activate a potential water molecule as nucleophile in a double displacement mechanism. On the other hand, the steric situation is ideal for a direct attack on the anomeric C-atom of rhamnose by the bound water molecule, activated by Glu359 and Asp395 as general bases. Therefore, an inverting mechanism with Glu359 and Asp395 as general bases and Asp392 as general acid is proposed.",

The 6-methyl is common to the recognised 3,6-dideoxyhexoses paratose, abequose and tyvelose. Therefore, the position of repeating unit I is almost identical in the three complex structures determined by X-ray crystallography. In contrast, the 3,6-dideoxyhexose of repeating unit II points into a shallow depression. The stereochemistry of the 3,6-dideoxyhexoses abequose and tyvelose is clearly seen in the electron density, as shown for repeating unit II (Figure 12). The accommodation of abequose or tyvelose of serotypes B and D1 is achieved by positional wobbling between two acidic residues, Asp303 and Glu309 (Figure 13).

Nature has solved the requirements for both proteins by a very different architecture. The molecular axis of haemagglutinin comprises a long three-\u03b1-helix bundle as a characteristic feature, whereas the central structural element of the tailspike protein is a three-\u03b2-helix bundle. The receptor binding site of haemagglutinin is located in a carbohydrate binding domain at its tip, comprising a jelly-roll fold as often observed in viral coat proteins (Weis et al., 1988). The receptor binding site of the tailspike protein is located at the centre of the molecule. Its cleft-structure is ideal to recognise the elongated O-antigen polymer of LPS. The different locations and architectures of the binding sites reflects different substrate types.",

Therefore, the low enzymatic activity will not contribute much to lateral mobility and it will certainly not give the tailspike protein the function of a drill in order to remove the O-antigen from the LPS and make a potential second receptor accessible. However, the activity is high enough to cleave a few O-antigen chains during the infection process. The location of the active site proximal to the cell surface with respect to the binding site is compatible with a liberating function to release newly assembled phages after cell lysis from the cell debris.",

The head-binding domain and the C-terminal part are probably linked in a flexible manner. Two O-antigenic repeating units are sufficient for receptor binding. They are recognised in a 20 \u00c5 long cleft in the centre of the 150 \u00c5 long molecule, which is located between insertions into the right-handed parallel \u03b2-helix main body of the molecule. The active-site topology suggests an inverting endoglycosidase mechanism with Asp392 as general acid and a catalytic water molecule activated by Glu359 and Asp395 as general bases. The multiple host specificity is achieved by a wobble mechanism between two acidic residues, Asp303 and Glu309 in a subsite for 3,6-dideoxyhexoses (paratose, abequose and tyvelose), which also involves water-mediated contacts to the protein as an essential feature. The glucose introduced by O-antigen form variation is accommodated in an additional subsite for the O-antigen repeating unit proximal to the active site.",

Six sites were identified in the Met(Te) derivative (TEME) using difference Patterson and difference Fourier maps with the PROTEIN package (Steigemann, 1991). A double derivative UOTE was subsequently prepared. Phases for difference Fourier maps were calculated with MLPHARE (CCP4, 1994) and improved with DM (CCP4, 1994) by solvent flattening and histogram mapping.
