Viruses that cause infections of the upper airway include rhinovirus, coronavirus, influenza A and B viruses, parainfluenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and adenovirus. Most of these viral infections occur during the early fall to early spring, manifesting as a common cold, and the incidence of sinusitis is higher during this time [1]. Viral URTI stimulates increases in inflammation and in the local immune response of the nasopharynx and surrounding mucosa. Some viruses, such as influenza virus, produce significant mucosal damage. Others promote the local production of cytokines and other inflammatory mediators, leading to the signs and symptoms of the common cold (i.e., viral URTI) [5].",

Viruses have a suppressive effect on the function of neutrophils, macrophages, and lymphocytes [5], including diminished adherent, chemotactic, phagocytic, oxidative, secretory, and bactericidal functions of neutrophils. Viruses also decrease the function of macrophages and lymphocytes, resulting in patients with viral URTIs being generally more vulnerable to secondary overgrowth and subsequent bacterial infection by pathogens that colonize the nasopharynx, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae. Colonization with nontypeable H. influenzae is significantly affected by concurrent infection with RSV; however, the site of bacterial attachment is not known. The mechanism of attachment involves up-regulation of expression of epithelial cell\u2013surface receptors, including CEACAM1 and intercellular adhesion molecule\u20131 [5]. Attachment sites for S. pneumoniae may also be exposed.",

[6] instilled S. pneumoniae during ongoing nasal allergic inflammation in a mouse model and found that allergy augments the infection and the resultant inflammatory response. They also showed that allergy alone or allergen exposure did not enhance the sinus infection, which suggests that local inflammation is important. The scientific basis for the role that allergy plays in ABRS includes the following theories: release of mediators from mast cells during an allergic reaction causes greater transudation of fluid and increased proliferation of bacteria in the sinus cavities; inflammatory mediators released by eosinophils during an allergic reaction expose epithelial S. pneumoniae binding sites; and ciliary transport from the sinuses altered by allergic inflammation reduces clearance of bacteria.",

Fever, myalgia, and pharyngitis frequently associated with a viral URTI usually resolve by approximately day 5 [5]. Nasal congestion, postnasal drainage, and cough may persist into the second and third weeks. Notably, a change in the color of the nasal discharge does not suggest the presence of bacterial infection [5]. To determine the point in time if and when a secondary bacterial infection develops becomes a clinical and diagnostic dilemma, Lacroix et al.

The tissue-to-blood ratios were >4 : 1 at most sites. In a second study, Gehanno et al. [31] measured moxifloxacin concentrations in sinus tissue after steady-state conditions (i.e., 400 mg/day for 5 days) had been reached in patients with chronic sinusitis. Concentrations of moxifloxacin in sinus mucosa were consistently higher than those in plasma: 4.56\u20135.73 mg/kg at 2\u20136 h after administration of a dose versus 1.25\u20132.81 mg/kg at 12\u201336 h after administration of a dose. The tissue : plasma ratio was 200%\u2013328.9% (2\u201336 h after administration of a dose). Similar findings were found in other types of sinus tissue (e.g., maxillary sinus and anterior ethmoid sinus or nasal polyps). In both studies, sinus mucosal concentrations were well above MIC90 values of moxifloxacin against a wide range of bacteria. In a study that used pharmacodynamic end points to evaluate gatifloxacin for the treatment of acute maxillary sinusitis, the median 24-h AUC for sinus aspirates and plasma samples was 1.51 (range, 0.88\u20132.23) [32].",

Resistance to this pathogen occurs in 2 discrete steps, with spontaneous mutations occurring initially in parC and secondarily in gyrA [3435\u201336]. Because there is increasing evidence that selection of resistant pneumococcal strains may vary among the respiratory fluoroquinolones, a new pharmacodynamic tool\u2014the mutant prevention concentration (MPC) theory\u2014has been developed. In brief, the MPC is the concentration required to inhibit the growth of the least susceptible wild-type mutants (i.e., single-step mutants), whereas the MIC is the lowest concentration needed to stop growth of wild-type bacteria [37]. Among a large number of clinical isolates of fluoroquinolone-susceptible S. pneumoniae (n = 146), moxifloxacin was found to be the fluoroquinolone least likely to select for resistant mutants, followed by gatifloxacin and levofloxacin [38, 39]. Additional preliminary in vitro data suggest that AUC : MICs >100 may protect against the selection of resistant S. pneumoniae mutants [40].",

Collectively, treatment guidelines from North America and some countries in Europe reveal that amoxicillin and amoxicillin-clavulanate are the most commonly recommended agents for the treatment of ABRS [5, 20]. Macrolides are the second most commonly used class globally, but national guidelines from the United States, France, and Spain recommend either no role or a limited role for macrolides, because of concerns about resistance in S. pneumoniae and because of their intrinsically poor activity against H. influenzae [5, 20]. The respiratory fluoroquinolones are positioned for use in patients with moderate or severe disease and those who have a history of recent antimicrobial use, when there is a failure to improve on the results of initial therapy after 72 h, and if there is an environment of antimicrobial resistance [5].",
