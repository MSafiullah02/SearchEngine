We try to combine mathematical physics and biology into a picoscope of life. For this, we merge techniques that were introduced and developed in modern mathematical physics, largely by Ludvig Faddeev, to describe objects such as solitons and Higgs and to explain phenomena such as anomalies in gauge fields. We propose a synthesis that can help to resolve the protein folding problem, one of the most important conundrums in all of science. We apply the concept of gauge invariance to scrutinize the extrinsic geometry of strings in three-dimensional space. We evoke general principles of symmetry in combination with Wilsonian universality and derive an essentially unique Landau-Ginzburg energy that describes the dynamics of a generic stringlike configuration in the far infrared. We observe that the energy supports topological solitons that relate to an anomaly similarly to how a string is framed around its inflection points. We explain how the solitons operate as modular building blocks from which folded proteins are composed. We describe crystallographic protein structures by multisolitons with experimental precision and investigate the nonequilibrium dynamics of proteins under temperature variations. We simulate the folding process of a protein at in vivo speed and with close to picoscale accuracy using a standard laptop computer. With picobiology as next pursuit of mathematical physics, things can only get better.",

Long before that, Ludvig Faddeev first drew my attention to a sentence in the introduction of Dirac's stunning 1931 article [2] , \"There are at present fundamental problems in theoretical physics awaiting solution, e.g. the relativistic formulation of quantum mechanics and the nature of atomic nuclei (to be followed by more difficult ones such as the problem of life).\" This epitomizes what could be proclaimed as the three Dirac problems in theoretical physics. The first Dirac problem was solved de facto at the time of writing. Dirac introduced his equation in 1928. Maybe he already had quantum gravity in his mind; it has been stated in exalted circles that this is a problem settled by string theory. A resolution to the second Dirac problem, the nature of atomic nuclei, took almost half a century of collective efforts to develop. We now trust that LHC experiments at CERN demonstrate how all four known fundamental interactions are governed by the Weinberg-Salam standard model and quantum chromodynamics plus Einstein's gravity. But there remain important conundrums awaiting solution, including quark (color) confinement.",

How could Dirac envisage that the notion of life could be defined as a theoretical physics problem? Did he presume that eventually life can be described with a conceptual clarity that compares with quantum mechanics? Today, we are reaching a point where a precise definition of the problem of life can be attempted. We understand that proteins are the workhorses of all living cells. They participate in all the metabolic activities that constitute life as we know it. We have learned that the biological function of a protein is intimately related to its shape. It might hence be argued that the protein folding problem is the way to address the problem of life\u00e1 la Dirac. The quest is to describe the folding and dynamics of proteins with the eloquence of the equations in Dirac's 1931 article.",

Moreover, explicit profile (43) is both positive and negative and vanishes at s = s 0 . The consequences of \u03ba = 0 for a string hence deserve an investigation.

It can be seen how the Frenet framing experiences a sudden change: the zweibein (n, b) is reflected according to (n + ib) \u2192 \u2212(n + ib) = e \u00b1i\u03c0 (n + ib) (51) as it passes through the inflection point.

We have a frame anomaly. To examine this anomaly, we consider a string x(s) that has a simple inflection point when s = s 0 such that \u03ba(s 0 ) = 0 but \u03ba s (s 0 ) = 0.

Perestroikas are the only known stringy versions of bifurcations. Therefore, perestroikas have a potentially profound influence on the physical behavior of stringlike structures. Moreover, perestroikas relate to the frame anomaly, which is a structural attribute of a string. This identifies perestroikas as those bifurcations that drive string-specific phase transitions involving structural reorganizations. In particular, perestroikas prompt topological solitons such as (43) to appear and disappear along a string. Such processes are commonplace whenever we have an energy function of form (44) . It seems that for strings that model proteins, this is always the case. We find solitons and perestroikas everywhere in proteins.",

But proteins are not really continuous, differentiable strings. We must therefore extend our considerations accordingly. We start with the Frenet equations. In the \"scaling limit\" where the concepts of Wilsonian universality become applicable, a protein is like a piecewise-linear polygonal string. Its vertices coincide with the positions of the central C\u03b1 carbons (see Fig. 3 ). This reduction of the entire protein chain to a skeletal C\u03b1 backbone is an a priori enormous simplification. But as we show, it is nevertheless sufficient for describing the structure and dynamics of a protein with a subatomic precision. The approach that we propose matches the accuracy obtained in ultrahigh-resolution x-ray crystallography experiments.",

These parameters quantify the length of the bond angle profile that describes the soliton. For the torsion angle, Eq.

There are then the three additional parameters b/a, c/a, and d/a in the remainder\u03c4 [\u03ba].

The Sampo 1 would be a theoretical and computational framework that predicts the shape and describes the dynamics of a protein in its biological environment. The scale, complexity, and trophy of the endeavor are enormous. There are some 25 million protein sequences that have been identified through DNA sequencing, but only around 100 thousand structures have been experimentally determined so far [40] . Apparently, the average cost of a structure determination by x-ray crystallography is around $100,000, and crystallization of a protein can sometimes take years, if possible at all. We can hardly expect that the structures of a much larger percentage of sequences can ever be determined using the currently available experimental techniques.

The Newtonian equations of motion are introduced for each and every atom including solvent atoms. The equations are numerically integrated with a time step around a femtosecond, which is the characteristic time scale of peptide bond vibrations. Using purpose-built supercomputers like Anton [43] , [44] and distributed computing projects as described in [45] , the speediest MD simulations can reach a few microseconds of in vivo folding time in a day of numerical simulation [44] . This allows modeling relatively short, very fast-folding proteins such as the villin headpiece (HP35) and the \u03bb-repressor protein 1LMB in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) [40] up to time scales that it takes for these proteins to fold.",

For example, myoglobin, a protein described in all biochemistry textbooks, has 154 residues and folds in about 2.5 seconds [46] . Running at a top speed of a few microseconds per day, Anton should take more than 1,000 years to fold a myoglobin [44] . And Anton is by far the fastest special-purpose MD machine ever built. Accordingly, we need some 10 11 orders of magnitude more in computer speed before MD simulations of proteins like myoglobin can occur at the speed of life, and this is if there is no compelling need to increase the number of involved atoms substantially. The development of processors with constantly increasing clock speeds has apparently stalled. Consequently, modeling protein dynamics over long time periods using all-atom MD at the speed of life seems unrealistic in the foreseeable future.",

Consequently, several essential all-atom ingredients still remain to be tackled by implicit and effective methods in lieu of all-atom MD. An important example is acidity in the case of explicit water. The proper level of acidity is pivotal to numerous biological processes. Even a slight shift in acidity sometimes leads to a major change in protein structure and function. A good example is amylin [47] , a short polypeptide hormone that has been implicated in the onset of type-II diabetes. Much remains to be done to understand how amylin functions. Comprehensively mimicking its properties by computation requires performing simulations that model amylin both inside the \u03b2-cell granules of the pancreas, where pH \u2248 5.5, and in the extra-cellular domain, where pH \u2248 7.4 and where the disease-causing amyloidosis occurs, as well as in the passage through the cell membrane. The structure of amylin seems very different in the two different pH environments. For an all-atom simulation to tackle the difference, we suppose that 10 9 explicit water molecules are introduced, which is four to five orders of magnitude more than what is currently possible, even with Anton. But this only allows a few tens of explicit hydronium ions to model the physiological pH \u2248 7.4 at the all-atom level. This hardly suffices. When it comes to acidity, today's all-atom MD remains far from all atoms.",

This is an enormous number, obviously comparable to or even greater than the combined national debt of both the USA and the EU countries in rubles. From this standpoint, the protein folding problem seems doomed to endure among the preeminent unresolved conundrums in science for a long time to come. But this enormous gap between the speed of life and the available speed of computer modeling is also an excellent opportunity. There is a vast Every Man's Land available for the development of alternative computationally effective approaches. For this, various coarse-grained models are being developed. Contributions to the all-atom force fields that are presumed to be less relevant are systematically eliminated. A simplified geometry can also be used. For example, the UNRES [48] force field provides a very detailed and finely tuned coarse-grained potential energy with some 15 different terms in combination with a simplified geometry. Present coarse-graining can extend all-atom MD simulations by some four to five orders of magnitude. This considerable success of coarse-graining raises the question of what the truly relevant contributions to the free energy function are.",

To describe this in vivo environment, the Newtonian equations of the all-atom Hamiltonian must be modified to mimic a constant temperature setting. Diverse thermostats have been developed for this. They facilitate the MD simulation of protein folding, mostly under stationary nonequilibrium conditions. It remains a delicate challenge to construct a purely Hamiltonian thermostat that both models the canonical ensemble of the original system and allows a computationally effective discretizing for speedy and reliable simulations. Realizing a thermostat often involves deforming the all-atom Newtonian equation into a Langevin equation. But such an equation is both nondeterministic and non-time-irreversible, and the original reason for considering a Hamiltonian framework is lost. Unfortunately, it appears impossible to construct a canonical thermostat Hamiltonian that has both a finite number of thermostat variables and a nonsingular potential. The most widely used canonical thermostat in MD simulations of protein folding is perhaps the one by Nos\u00e9 and Hoover [55] , [56] . In its simplest variant, this thermostat has a Hamiltonian character, although it has a singularity. The all-atom phase space is extended by a single ghost particle with a logarithmically divergent potential; its role is to provide a temperature for all the other particles.",

As an example, we show the (\u03ba i , \u03c4 i ) spectrum in the case of the \u03bb-repressor protein with the PDB code 1LMB in Fig. 5 . The spectrum is fairly typical for a PDB configuration.",

The general bifurcation analysis in Secs. 10 and 11 relates to a continuous string with a differentiable curvature and torsion. We therefore need an extension of the general results to the specific case of a piecewise-linear string. We continue to interpret a change in the sign of \u03c4 i in terms of a flattening point. This suggests that an inflection point perestroika has occurred. Accordingly, we implement a series of Z 2 gauge transformations (63) in the vicinity of putative flattening points, where \u03c4 i changes sign or is otherwise unsettled, to identify the putative multisoliton profile in \u03ba i . For example, in the 1LMB case, there are four regions with an irregular \u03c4 i profile. By a judicious choice of Z 2 gauge transformations (see Fig. 6 ), we identify seven different solitons (69) in \u03ba i . Each soliton profile is clearly accompanied by a putative flattening points we note the multivaluedness of \u03c4 i . The general considerations in Secs. 10 and 11, although developed for continuous strings, are very much applicable for analyzing a generic discrete C\u03b1 protein profile. We conclude that protein folding is due to inflection and flattening point perestroikas. These bifurcations deform the C\u03b1 backbone and create dNLS solitons along it.",

It can be proved [62] , [63] that MC simulation with (80) approaches the Gibbsian distribution exponentially. The method should therefore provide a statistically meaningful description of near-equilibrium protein folding dynamics, at least during adiabatic temperature variations. In our simulations of near-equilibrium proteins, we renormalize the numerical value of the temperature factor kT such that it coincides with the experimentally observed \u03b8-point temperature [64] . We proceed as follows. We start by tuning (64) and (65) to describe a given, typically very low-temperature crystallographic protein configuration form the PDB as a multisoliton. For this, we use the program Propro (described in http://www.folding-protein.org). After the multisoliton is constructed, we subject it to extensive heating and cooling simulations. We start from a vanishingly low temperature value with no apparent thermal fluctuations in the C\u03b1 positions. We slowly increase the temperature until we observe a structural transition similar to a phase transition above which the configuration resembles a random walker. The transition identifies the renormalization point of the temperature factor; it occurs at the \u03b8-point temperature. A convenient order parameter for detecting the \u03b8-point is the C\u03b1-trace gyration radius [65] , [66] ",
