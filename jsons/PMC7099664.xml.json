This slow evolution with a high safety profile may have engendered some complacency on the part of endoscopists, to the point that many endoscopists are only vaguely aware of what goes on \u201cbehind the curtain\u201d of the endoscope reprocessing room. Instruments are used on patients, taken away by GI nurses or other health care personnel, reprocessed, and returned ready for patient use. As the complexity of reprocessing and recognition of its importance become a concern to the medical community and our patients, endoscopists must become more educated on these issues and thereby able to participate in informed discussions with their patients. This chapter presents a pragmatic approach to proper reprocessing of endoscopic equipment, with guidance for prevention and management of infection transmission, and includes newer sterilization and disinfection technologies.",

Steam is the most extensively utilized process and is routinely monitored by the use of biologic indicators (e.g., spore test strips) to show that sterilization has been achieved. When liquid chemical germicides (LCGs) are used to eradicate all microorganisms, they can be called chemical sterilants; however, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and other authorities have stated that these processes do not convey the same level of assurance as other sterilization methods.28, 29, 30 Other commonly used sterilization processes include low-temperature gas such as ethylene oxide (ETO), liquid chemicals, and hydrogen peroxide gas plasma.31\n",

Three levels of disinfection are achievable depending on the amount and kind of microbial killing involved. These levels of disinfection are as follows:1.High-level disinfection (HLD): the destruction of all viruses, vegetative bacteria, fungi, mycobacterium, and some, but not all, bacterial spores.32, 33 For LCGs, HLD is operationally defined as the ability to kill 106 mycobacteria (a six-log reduction). The efficacy of HLD is dependent on several factors and includes the type and level of microbial contamination; effective precleaning of the endoscope; presence of biofilm; physical properties of the object; concentration, temperature, pH, and exposure time to the germicide; and drying after rinsing to avoid diluting the disinfectant.32\n2.Intermediate-level disinfection: the destruction of all mycobacteria, vegetative bacteria, fungal spores, and some nonlipid viruses, but not bacterial spores.3.Low-level disinfection: a process that can kill most bacteria (except mycobacteria or bacterial spores), most viruses (except some nonlipid viruses), and some fungi.Although this categorization for disinfection levels generally remains valid, there are examples of disinfection issues with prions, viruses, mycobacteria, and protozoa that challenge these definitions.34\n",

Spaulding developed a rational approach to disinfection and sterilization of medical equipment based on the risk of infection involved with the use of these instruments.35, 36 The classification scheme defined these categories of medical devices and their associated level of disinfection as follows:1.Critical: critical devices or instruments come into contact with sterile tissue or the vascular system. These devices confer a high risk for infection if they are contaminated. This category includes biopsy forceps, sphincterotomes, surgical instruments, and implants, when used in sterile anatomic locations. Reprocessing of these instruments requires sterilization.2.Semicritical: semicritical devices contact intact mucous membranes and do not ordinarily penetrate sterile tissue. These instruments include endoscopes, bronchoscopes, transesophageal echocardiography probes, and anesthesia equipment. Reprocessing of these instruments requires a minimum of HLD.3.Noncritical: noncritical devices contact intact skin (e.g., stethoscopes or blood pressure cuffs). These items should be cleaned by low-level disinfection.\n",

In addition, survival of small numbers of bacterial spores with HLD is considered acceptable because the intact mucosa of the GI tract is resistant to bacterial spore infection.",

The AER manufacturer identifies each endoscope (brand and model) that is compatible with the AER and specifies limitations of reprocessing models of endoscopes and accessories. Variations in AERs may require customization of the facility design to accommodate requirements for ventilation; water pressure, temperature, and filtration; plumbing; power delivery; and space. All models of AERs have disinfection and rinse cycles. In addition, the AERs may also have one or more of the following automated capabilities:32, 68, 71\n1.Some AERs utilize and discard small quantities of LCG per HLD cycle, whereas others have a reservoir of LCG that is reused over multiple cycles. The latter design results in gradual dilution of the LCG and requires intermittent testing to verify maintenance of the minimum effective concentration (MEC). Product-specific test strips need to be used regularly to monitor these solutions,48 which should be discarded whenever they fall below the MEC or when the use-life expires, whichever comes first.2.The temperature and cycle length can be altered to ensure HLD or sterilization based on the LCG and type of endoscope.3.The AER should ensure circulation of LCGs through all endoscope channels at an equal pressure with flow sensors for automated detection of channel obstruction.4.The AER should be self-disinfecting.5.Vapor recovery systems are available.6.Low intensity ultrasound waves are an option.7.Variable number of endoscopes per cycle.8.Some AERs flush the endoscope channels with forced air or with 70% to 80% ethyl or isopropyl alcohol followed by forced air to aid in drying the endoscope channels, thereby eliminating residual water, which reduces microbial growth during storage.9.The AER should incorporate a self-contained or external water filtration system.LCGs and AERs must meet specified performance levels for HLD to receive FDA clearance. This is defined as a reduction in residual organic loads and a 6-log10 killing of resistant indicator organisms (typically Mycobacterium bovis). All AERs marketed in the United States meet these criteria. The ASGE has published a summary of vendor-specific AERs and their compatible LCGs.65 The FDA has approved labeling some AERs as washer-disinfectors due to the introduction of automated, brushless washing of endoscope channels prior to the disinfection cycle. Utilization of this AER washing cycle provides an extra margin of safety by providing redundancy of cleaning; however, the existing multisociety guideline45 and other international standards emphasize that manual cleaning is still necessary when a washer-disinfector is used to assure the overall efficacy of HLD.65, 72\n",

Additional steps must be taken, such as the application of a venting valve or the removal of the water-resistant cap to ensure proper perfusion with the gas and to prevent damage to the endoscope due to excessive pressure build-up.

The key \u201cdomino\u201d in this chain of changes was the 2015 FDA Guide to Manufacturers of Reusable Medical Devices (FDA, March 2015) that required manufacturers to validate that their cleaning instructions were effective and could achieve predetermined benchmarks. Cleaning validation for medical device reprocessing was not previously required; the focus was on validation of the disinfection or sterilization protocols recommended by manufacturers for their medical devices. When transmission of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) associated with contaminated duodenoscopes was recognized and first investigated and reported in the United States,14 it was unclear why reprocessing of duodenoscopes was failing. However, it was clear that transmission rates from contaminated duodenoscopes were high (up to 45%) and that, in addition to causing infections, patients often became colonized with CRE and remained colonized long after the exposure to the CRE contaminated duodenoscope. Some health care facilities continued to report CRE transmission and suggested that the manufacturers' instructions for use (MIFUs) for endoscope reprocessing were inadequate15, 103, 116 and that was why endoscope contamination was ongoing. Although there had been recent design changes by the three main duodenoscope manufacturers whereby the elevator wire channel was sealed, the transmission of CRE was reported for duodenoscopes with both sealed and unsealed elevator wire channels.14, 15, 103 However, one thing was clear; it was very difficult to adequately clean the lever cavity in duodenoscopes, and visible patient debris under the elevator lever was detected in one published outbreak.95 This has prompted new validated cleaning instructions for the lever cavity of duodenoscopes.117 The CRE outbreaks linked to contaminated duodenoscopes prompted the FDA to convene an advisory panel meeting in May 2015, and on August 4, 2015, the FDA issued a Safety Communication110 with the recommendations from the advisory panel meeting that included:1.Establishing and implementing a comprehensive quality control program for endoscopy reprocessing to ensure meticulous adherence to MIFUs for duodenoscope reprocessing, adequate training of reprocessing personnel, and audits to ensure ongoing compliance.2.Supplemental measures to be considered by sites offering ERCP procedures, including:\u2022Microbiological culture with quarantine of contaminated endoscopes until culture results become available;\u2022Meticulous cleaning and HLD followed by one of:\u2022ETO sterilization,\u2022Liquid chemical sterilization, or\u2022Repeat HLD.\n\nThe FDA safety alert was followed by a CDC Health Advisory in September 2015, that indicated an immediate need for sites utilizing duodenoscopes to undertake audits of the reprocessing protocol, as well as staff training and longitudinal audits to document ongoing staff competency.",

Review of the pros and cons of the testing method based on the validation data provided by the manufacturer is an important step when selecting the RCT. Examples of the considerations for selecting the RCT are shown in Table 4.5\n. Once the RCT has been selected, a way to document the RCT results is needed (e.g., a record sheet that identifies the scope tested, the person doing the testing, date and time of testing, result of testing, and the result of retesting for those scopes that fail the RCT and require recleaning).",

Remedial action would be needed for the endoscopes, which may include a longer soak time in detergent followed by extended brushing and flushing (as per scope manufacturer's input).

A Rapid Post-Disinfection Test (RPDT) that could be completed just prior to the next patient use of the scope to confirm that the endoscope does not contain viable microorganisms would be ideal. However, there is little published data for the two RPDT tests that are currently available (Table 4.6\n). In the absence of validated rapid test methods, culture is the only well-studied method for detection of microbial contamination of flexible endoscopes postdisinfection/-sterilization. However, there are a number of considerations when culture is used. There have been a variety of published studies on culture results from endoscopes, but there is little data on the recovery efficiency of the various endoscope extraction methods that have been used.137 If a patient-ready endoscope is extracted by flushing the channel with bacterial culture media or other harvesting fluids containing various proteins or buffers containing salt, then the endoscope requires recleaning and disinfection prior to being used on a patient. If sterile, high-quality water (i.e., reverse osmosis or deionized water) is used to flush endoscope channels, the endoscope can be dried and then still be safely used on the next patient.",

The training process should be documented and new staff not allowed to reprocess endoscopes on their own until they have demonstrated, under supervision, that they are competent to perform reprocessing independently. The use of rapid cleaning monitor (RCM) tests for each endoscope reprocessed during training is an excellent way to document the adequacy of the trainee's ability to perform the cleaning process. Reprocessing errors are a common underlying problem for many of the reported outbreaks.95, 97, 98, 123 The \u201chuman factors\u201d study done by Ofstead et al (2010)115 showed that inadequate cleaning of channels related to the lack of adequate channel brushing (43% of scopes) and inadequate drying (45% of scopes) prior to storage of endoscopes were the two most common breaches in endoscope reprocessing. As outlined by recent guidelines,48, 107, 108, 123 initial training and ongoing competency assessment are critical to ensuring that staff can effectively reprocess flexible endoscopes.",

In the hierarchy of relative resistance to HLD, vegetative bacteria such as Pseudomonas spp. and Salmonella spp. are the most susceptible to disinfectants, whereas the mycobacteria are less susceptible and bacterial spores (e.g., Bacillus subtilis and Clostridium difficile) are the most difficult to eliminate (see Box 4.1). Nevertheless, as previously stated, all bacteria with the exception of a few bacterial spores are highly sensitive and eliminated by HLD. Salmonella is a serious primary pathogen, and Pseudomonas is ubiquitous in many water sources, and although both these pathogens have been associated most frequently with endoscopic transmission, they are both sensitive to multiple agents, including glutaraldehyde, and other HLDs.

This involves sampling the duodenoscope channels and the distal end of the scope to identify any bacterial contamination that may be present on the scope after reprocessing.159, 198 It must be recognized that the sensitivity of surveillance culturing of the elevator channel, the elevator lever cavity, or other scope channels is unknown. Until there are evidence-based guidelines, individual hospitals should choose from these different options based on available information and feasibility for their medical practice. However, at a minimum, there should be an audit of all facilities offering duodenoscope procedures to ensure the site has a quality system in place and is compliant with current MIFUs and guidelines.",

            "text": "The investigation of a breach in reprocessing or resultant outbreak should be undertaken using a standardized approach. It should focus on the identification of factor(s) that led to the exposure and protect patients from potential adverse events. The investigation should not be punitive and not attempt to assign blame to any particular individual. Rutala et al (2007)199 described a process for exposure investigation, and the ASGE has published guidelines for patient assessment and notification when there is a suspected failure in the disinfection or sterilization protocol.200 These can be summarized as follows:199, 200\n1.Confirm that the reprocessing failure occurred and assess the duration of exposure (e.g., review sterilization methods and AER records of biological parameters).2.Quarantine any endoscopes or associated accessories that malfunctioned or are at risk for inadequate reprocessing.3.Do not use the devices in question, such as the endoscope or AER, until proper functioning is confirmed.4.Prepare a list of potentially exposed patients, dates of exposure, and inadequately reprocessed or malfunctioning devices used.5.Reporting:\u2022Inform facility leadership: breaches in patient safety with serious potential infection risks should be reported to facility leadership, including infection control, risk management, public relations, legal department, and selectively to local/state public health agencies, the FDA, CDC, and the manufacturers of the involved equipment.200, 203 This will help with the investigation and lead to an expeditious correction of any deficiencies that are identified.\u2022A user facility is not required to report a device malfunction, but it can voluntarily advise the FDA of such product problems using the voluntary MedWatch Form FDA 3500 under FDA's Safety Information and Adverse Event Reporting Program.201 However, if a device failure leads to a death or serious injury, the FDA and the manufacturer must be contacted, as outlined in facility policies, by the designated individual or department at the facility.202 The FDA encourages health care professionals, patients, caregivers, and consumers to submit voluntary reports of significant adverse events or product problems with medical products to MedWatch (https://www.accessdata.fda.-gov/scripts/medwatch/), the FDA's Safety Information and Adverse Event Reporting Program\u2022Manufacturers are required to report to the FDA when they learn that any of their devices may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or when they become aware that their device has malfunctioned and would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur.201, 202\n\n6.Patient notification and counseling:200, 203 in instances where a breach in the reprocessing protocol or damaged equipment poses a risk to patients for adverse events, it becomes the institution's ethical obligation to notify patients in a timely manner. Notification may be accomplished by a direct meeting, telephone call, and letter sent by registered mail. The content should include an assessment of the risk, possible adverse events that may occur, symptoms and signs of the adverse event, time range for the adverse event, risk to other contacts, possible prophylactic therapy (including benefits and risks), and recommended medical follow-up. Prompt notification allows patients to take precautions to minimize the risk of transmitting infection to others and allows for early serologic testing. This may help distinguish chronic infections from those potentially acquired at the time of endoscopy and to permit earlier initiation of treatment for newly acquired infections. On the other hand, adverse publicity associated with the reporting of a reprocessing error might lead patients to avoid potentially life-saving endoscopic procedures because of an unwarranted fear of infection.Personal counseling should be offered to all patients. The risk of infection should be discussed and placed in context to minimize patient anxiety. Patients should be advised against donating blood and tissue products and engaging in sexual contact without barrier protection until all serologic testing is complete. A toll-free helpline should be established to provide information to all patients at risk.\n7.Develop a long-term follow-up plan (e.g., long-term surveillance, changes in current policies and procedures) and prepare an after action report.\n",

Unlike surgical instruments where the microbial load is less than 100 bacteria for 75% of instruments,139, 204 the load of microorganisms in channels of flexible endoscopes can be as high as 1010 bacteria124 per instrument channel (e.g., for colonoscopes). During transport from the procedure room to the reprocessing area,48 flexible GI endoscopes require a rigid, sealed container that is appropriately labeled as biohazardous. This protects the endoscope from accidental damage and also ensures that any patient-derived secretions and microorganisms are adequately contained and cannot drip out and contaminate the environment. All reusable accessory items (valves, flushing adaptors, cleaning valves, etc.) should be transported along with the associated endoscope. During transport, the endoscope and all accessory items should be kept moist to prevent drying of patient-derived material. If endoscopes are transported to a central reprocessing facility, evaluation of the time of transport should be conducted to determine the frequency of excessive transit times.",

Fresh disposable gloves are needed for removing and handling fully reprocessed endoscopes from the AER and during manual channel drying and placing the endoscope into the clean storage cabinet. Fresh disposable gloves should also be used whenever an endoscope is removed from the clean storage cabinet. The use of gloves helps protect both the reprocessing personnel from contamination with patient-derived microorganisms and the fully reprocessed endoscope from contamination with skin-derived microorganisms from reprocessing personnel.

This includes total immersion of the endoscope during cleaning.48, 108 This ensures that any patient material removed from the channels during cleaning is contained within the detergent cleaning solution. Care is needed to ensure all brushing steps are done underneath the water surface to reduce aerosols. Holding the control head above water to insert the channel brush and then pulling the brush out of the channel while the control head is above the water generates significant aerosols of the contaminated detergent solution. In addition, during the air-flushing process after cleaning is completed, a piece of gauze should be placed over the distal end of the endoscope channel prior to placing it in an AER to prevent creation of aerosols when flushing out residual rinse water. A final, often overlooked step, is rinsing and decontamination of the sink after EACH endoscope is cleaned. This ensures that the sink does not accumulate microbial contamination over time and act as a reservoir within the reprocessing area to contaminate reprocessing personnel or other endoscopes. If flushing pumps are used as part of the manual cleaning step, they also require routine (usually daily) decontamination as per MIFU to ensure they do not become a reservoir of microbes that develop biofilm and subsequently contaminate endoscopes that they are used on.",
