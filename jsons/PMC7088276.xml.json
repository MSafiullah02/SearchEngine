The new information system may not necessarily utilize new technologies, but is considered an innovation because it enables changes to extant processes and workflows.

When the success of the innovation requires buy-in from many organizations as is true with an interorganizational system, the innovation must be malleable enough to fit the requirements, preferences and processes of each partnering organization while preserving the purpose of the collective entity. Striking a balance between the ability to customize systems to individuals\u2019 or departments\u2019 needs (a key benefit of IS flexibility) and information-sharing transparency (a key benefit of uniformity) is an ongoing challenge for many organizations.",

Reinvention usually enhances the likelihood of an innovation\u2019s acceptance and further diffusion. Reinvention may affect an individual user (as when an individual customizes software developed by someone else to suit his/her specific requirements) or an organization (as when a new scheduling system is introduced to reduce patient waiting time in a medical facility, then modified to better suit the needs of the adopting organization and/or its users).",

Hays (1996) studied how state policies enacted as laws were reinvented as they were diffused into subsequent states, finding that policies were reinvented based on a combination of social learning, political characteristics, and contextual factors. Lewis and Seibold (1993) consider two components of innovation reinvention, distinguishing between fidelity (how well the reinvention matches the original intent of the design or intended use) and uniformity (referring to the degree of similarity of use across users). They illustrate their framework in a single organization by studying characteristics of adopting individuals. When considering an innovation that is intended to be adopted by a large number of potentially dissimilar organizations, studying both aspects of fidelity and uniformity at the organizational level is likely to increase understanding of the importance and complexity of reinvention in a large-scale diffusion (informal) or dissemination (formal) effort.",

For example, health care professionals must contend with extensive external vigilance (e.g., laws, regulations and government oversight) and unique funding structures (a mix of internal and external sources, the latter usually limited to specific capital projects and loaded with financial and operational restrictions). In addition, unlike the corporate or government sectors, multiple hierarchies exist in the social networks of the medical professions (West et al. 1999; Dopson et al. 2002). Doctors have flatter, more informal networks than nurses\u2019 hierarchical ones. As a result, doctors are more likely to be effective at influencing peers to adopt or reinvent innovations. These social networks are a dominant means for diffusion of innovation in health care. With their complex organizational structures, tangled regulatory oversight and irregular opportunistic funding for innovations, the health services arena provides a rich and complex background in which to study innovation reinvention and diffusion.",

The Greenhalgh et al. article concludes with an extensive list of research questions, two of which are particularly relevant to the study related in this paper. They are:\u201cHow do innovations in Health Service organizations arise, and in what circumstances? What mix of factors tends to produce \u2018adoptable\u2019 innovations (e.g. ones that have clear advantages beyond their source organization and low implementation complexity and are readily adaptable to new contexts)?\u201d\n\u201cHow are innovations arising as \u2018good ideas\u2019 in local healthcare systems reinvented as they are transmitted through individual and organizational networks, and how can this process be supported or enhanced?\u201d (p. 617)\n",

Both initiatives involved capturing patient chief complaints data. Dr. Kenneth Mandl recalled that interest in bio-terror surveillance was already rising before September 11, 2001 and accelerated rapidly after the attacks:\u201cI started the bio-surveillance program here in 1999 after discussions with DARPA and the Hopkins Applied Physics Lab. It was a very early concept at the time. The Clinton Administration was interested in \u2026 protecting the public against bio-terrorist threats [by] \u2026 the use of medical and \u201cnontraditional\u201d data sources for purposes of surveillance. [Based on a proposal prepared in 1999] we received funding from the Agency for Health Care Research and Quality in 2000 for a bio-preparedness contract. The work we were doing became very, very popular in 2001. [Even before the 9/11 attacks], early in 2001 the federal commitment to bio-surveillance went from $50 million a year to more like $300 million a year. After the attacks in 2001, things really heated up. Since we were already on the ground and running, we expanded quite rapidly and I developed a contract with the Massachusetts Dept of Public Health to run the Massachusetts Surveillance System (MSS).\u201d\n",

Several argued that an alert physician was more likely to note an early instance of symptoms indicating a possible bio-terror attack or unusual disease outbreak, as had happened in the 2001 anthrax attacks. So, very early in the BioSense rollout, the first shift came in re-articulating the goal of BioSense away from noting the first instance of an occurrence of symptoms that might point to an outbreak, to what the designers referred to as \u201csituational awareness\u201d: using data to confirm (or disconfirm) an outbreak, to pinpoint where resources are most needed and to direct resources away from localities that do not show clusters of chief complaint symptoms. BioSense rapidly delineates geographic clusters of diseases or symptoms, and (even more important, in the view of one informant) helps to verify that a possible cluster is not cause for concern. Our informants emphasized also that BioSense was designed to spot geographic and time trends in sanitized (or de-identified) data, not to reveal nuances of individual patient data.",

As time passed and criticism intensified, participants came to realize that the BioSense tools that allowed chief complaints data to be shared and analyzed among hospitals could, with some modification also be used to confirm suspicions of naturally-occurring outbreaks, such as SARS or West Nile virus, as well as food- or water-borne contamination and other communicable diseases. By 2004, the CDC\u2019s CIO, Jim Seligman, was quoted as follows (Wolfson 2004):\u201cWe want to make sure the investments we make for terrorism will benefit daily public health, whether we have an event or not. We are trying to avoid building another stovepipe system that would only apply to terrorism and would sit idle 99.9 per cent of the time.

They used their extensive professional networks to obtain funding to demonstrate how patient data could be repurposed to detect patterns among symptoms and treatments. At the same time, the government was intent on finding a way to address the homeland security fear of a bio-terror attack, which loosed the purse strings to fund syndromic surveillance projects. The critical events of 9/11 and the anthrax scare plus the availability of data collected in health care IS further helped to grown nascent programs.

By extending its coverage to more detection of conditions that occur more frequently (such as influenza), the value of the system increased to adopting organizations. The incorporation of a new BioSense Influenza Module for the 2008 flu season is evidence of this transition (Lipowicz 2008). Indeed, prior research has found that routine use of a system that also supports emergency situations can greatly increase the acceptance of such a system. For example, the public safety network CapWIN was initially envisioned to support large-scale emergency collaboration. It was only when its value was demonstrated for day-to-day public safety support that it gained a critical mass of adopters (Fedorowicz et al. 2006, 2007).
