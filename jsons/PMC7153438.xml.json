The purpose of this chapter is to provide an overview of the epidemiology and diagnostic considerations of acute pulmonary complications as well as an updated review of specific disease entities or clinical situations in which acute respiratory failure can occur in this unique population of patients. The complications discussed will focus primarily on what is observed in recipients of allogeneic HCT.",

Traditionally, HCT-related pulmonary disease is considered in the context of the time frame after HCT. Complications that occur within the first 100 days are often categorized as early-onset; after the first 100 days is considered to be late-onset [2]. Early-onset complications tend to be acute in presentation and are directly related to lung injury from the transplantation procedure or infections associated with immune reconstitution status. Most episodes of acute respiratory failure occur in the early period, but acute respiratory failure can occur any time after HCT. After day 100, noninfectious pulmonary disease predominates in the spectrum of HCT-related complications as manifestations of late-onset lung injury or chronic graft-versus-host disease. Some patients experience acute respiratory failure as a consequence of these entities or from acute infections due to continued immunosuppression. There are several pulmonary syndromes that usually occur in the early post-HCT period, but can occasionally cause respiratory compromise in long-term survivors.",

A low tidal volume ventilation strategy, in which end-inspiratory plateau pressures are limited to reduce barotrauma and further lung injury, was shown to decrease the mortality from adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) by 22 % as compared to conventional ventilatory settings [7]. Early goal-directed therapy for sepsis as well as an emphasis on prompt empiric antibiotic administration directly impact survival of patients with severe sepsis and circulatory shock [8]. Additional attention to supportive care measures such as aspiration precautions, reduction of sedation, and prevention of iatrogenic complications have likely contributed to improvement in ICU outcomes. HCT-specific factors such as nonmyeloablative conditioning regimens have become more widespread in use, reducing initial toxicities. The incidence of acute GVHD has declined due to prophylactic strategies, and infectious prophylaxis has decreased the incidence of severe early infectious complications [1].",

Two retrospective studies done in the era of routine anti-infective prophylaxis against fungus, CMV, and Pneumocystis jirovecii, report the yield of fiberoptic bronchoscopy for a specific diagnosis is 34\u201350 %, with a higher yield for allogeneic HCT [15, 16].

A large retrospective study of 501 consecutive patients who underwent 598 BALs for the evaluation of new pulmonary infiltrates and suspected pneumonia during the first 100 days after HCT showed that the yield of BAL for clinically significant pathogens was 2.5-fold higher (p < 0.0001) if performed within the first 4 days of presentation, compared to those performed late, and that the yield was highest when performed within 24 h of presentation. Mortality at 30 and 100 days following the BAL was significantly lower when a diagnosis of infection was confirmed by early BAL compared to late BAL, which was associated with multidrug-resistant and polymicrobial infections [17].

When treatment decisions depend on a definitive diagnosis of a noninfectious etiology and when empiric therapy is risky, surgical lung biopsy may be required to achieve a specific diagnosis, as is that case for pulmonary venoocclusive disease and pulmonary cytologic thrombi, for example. Surgical lung biopsy has the advantage of direct visualization of the biopsy site, as well as obtaining a large enough piece of tissue that allows for histologic examination and culture. Bleeding in the setting of thrombocytopenia can be controlled directly. In contemporary practice surgical lung biopsy is usually performed videoscopically (video assisted thoracic surgery, or VATS), which theoretically reduces the morbidity associated with thoracotomy. Lung biopsy in this population must be carefully considered, as the morbidity of surgery in the setting of neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and/or respiratory failure may be unacceptably high, particularly if the overall prognosis is poor and specific therapy is unlikely to alter the outcome. White and colleagues at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center reviewed 67 open lung biopsies in 63 patients with hematologic malignancies from 1996 to 1998, including 25 bone marrow transplant patients, and found that a specific diagnosis was found in 41 (62 %) of the biopsies. Focal lesions were much more likely than diffuse lesions to yield a specific diagnosis (79 % vs. 36 %), and neutropenic or mechanically ventilated patients had a low likelihood of having a specific diagnosis. The risk of complications was significant, affecting 13 % of the biopsies, including 1 death [18].",

The likelihood of an HCT recipient undergoing a surgical lung biopsy has continued to decline in the past two decades, and infectious etiologies at lung biopsy, particularly invasive aspergillosis, are significantly less likely than a noninfectious etiology, likely due to the introduction of broad spectrum triazole therapy against invasive fungal infection in the early 2000s [21]. A recent meta-analysis showed that the overall yield of a specific diagnosis was similar between BAL and surgery (53 % vs. 54 %), with a complication rate of 8 and 15 % for BAL and surgery, respectively. The proportion of noninfectious diagnosis exceeded the infectious diagnoses with surgical biopsy [22].",

Broadly defined as widespread alveolar injury seen after HCT in the absence of active lower respiratory tract infection, cardiac dysfunction, acute renal failure, or iatrogenic fluid overload, IPS is thought to result from a variety of lung insults including toxic effects of the HCT conditioning regimen, immunologic cell-mediated injury, inflammatory cytokines, and occult pulmonary infections [2]. With the increasing use of new diagnostic methods such as multiplex PCR for respiratory viruses and the biomarker galactomannan for Aspergillus spp., the incidence of acute lung injury secondary to pulmonary infection has increased. Seo et al. have shown that approximately half of patients with IPS had pathogens detected in the BAL when these newer diagnostic methods were employed and that pathogen detection was associated with increased mortality. The most frequent pathogens were human herpes virus-6 (HHV-6), human rhinovirus (HRV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), and Aspergillus spp. [23]. Of note, HHV-6, like CMV, is in the human \u03b2- herpesvirus family and latently infects 95 % of healthy adults. HHV-6 has been shown to reactivate frequently in critically ill patients, but its specific role in the pathogenesis of respiratory disease and outcomes in critical illness remains unknown [24].\n",

The diagnosis of IPS is rarely confirmed by tissue biopsy given the significant risks of open lung biopsy in this population and the low yield of lung tissue by transbronchial biopsy via fiberoptic bronchoscopy recovered from HCT patients with acute lung injury.

As a histologic entity, organizing pneumonia (OP) may be associated with bacterial and viral infections, but most OP in the general population is idiopathic, hence the term cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (COP). In HCT recipients, the histology is characterized by patchy plugs of granulation tissue occupying distal terminal airways, alveolar ducts and alveolar sacs, widened alveolar septa and mononuclear cell infiltration, and accumulation of foamy macrophages within alveoli (Fig. 8.3) [36]. In the context of noninfectious pulmonary entities after HCT, COP may be considered a late-onset manifestation on one end of the spectrum of lung injury syndromes, of which IPS occupies the early onset, acute end of the spectrum [37].\n",

The association with severe acute GVHD and extensive chronic GVHD in survivors beyond day 100 was also shown in a large retrospective study of 193 HCT recipients from a Japanese registry of 9550 allogeneic HCT recipients. Other risk factors that were shown to be associated with COP included donor HLA disparity, female-to-male HCT, related peripheral blood stem cell transplantation and radiation as part of a myeloablative conditioning regimen [38].

The median time of onset in allogeneic HCT recipients is approximately 3 months after transplant, although many cases are diagnosed after day 100 and in long-term survivors up to several years after transplant. Since the presentation may be subacute and insidious, many patients are diagnosed in the outpatient setting, but the disease can progress to acute respiratory failure necessitating ventilator support. In the aforementioned case series, the median time to diagnosis was 108 days after HCT (range 5\u20132819 days), after a median symptom duration of 13 days. Pulmonary function testing may reveal a new restrictive defect (43 %), obstructive defect (11 %), mixed restrictive and obstructive defect (8 %), or normal physiology (38 %). Sixty-four percent had a new diffusing capacity deficit [36]. The radiographic hallmark of COP on chest CT is ground glass opacities, with linear opacities in an upper lobe, often bilateral, distribution (Fig. 8.3). Features of biopsy-proven COP on chest CT include ground glass opacities (94 %), consolidation (50 %), and linear opacities (50 %) with an upper lobe predominance (63 %) [39]. These linear opacities are usually not described in COP that occurs in non-HCT settings. Because the radiographic findings as well as the clinical presentation may mimic infectious pneumonia, bronchoscopy with lavage is recommended to exclude infectious etiologies. In cases in which a clinical diagnosis is still unclear, a histologic diagnosis by surgical lung biopsy may be warranted.",

Although the pathogenesis of BOS is unknown, it is likely a form of lung injury caused by an alloimmune response to the airway epithelium. An aberrant repair response results in the obliteration of small airways with fibrous material, which leads to the physiologic correlate of airways obstruction [42]. The clinical manifestations of BOS are usually insidious, but there is a phenotype of rapidly progressive airflow obstruction which can lead to primary respiratory failure [43].

The median time after HCT admission to the development of non-catheter-associated lower extremity DVT and pulmonary embolism was 63 and 66 days, respectively. Risk factors for the development of VTE were prior VTE and GVHD. Thrombocytopenia was only partially protective against the development of VTE [53]. The safety and efficacy of thromboprophylaxis in HCT patients remains uncertain. In patients with thrombocytopenia, anticoagulant therapy for documented VTE should be accompanied by platelet transfusions to maintain a platelet count of 50 \u00d7 109/L or greater to reduce the risk of bleeding complications [2].",

Right heart catheterization demonstrates elevated pulmonary artery pressures with normal pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, and angiography is used to exclude pulmonary emboli as the etiology for the pulmonary hypertension. The diagnosis of PVOD is strongly supported by the triad of pulmonary artery hypertension, radiographic evidence of pulmonary edema, and normal pulmonary artery occlusion pressures; however, lung biopsy confirms the diagnosis by the presence of extensive and diffuse intimal proliferation and fibrosis of pulmonary venules [54]. Treatment consists of high-dose corticosteroids (methylprednisolone 2 mg/kg/day) with anecdotal success, but the overall prognosis of PVOD after HCT remains poor [55].",

Prior to the implementation of CMV prophylaxis in the late 1990s, the incidence of CMV pneumonia was 10\u201330 % after allogeneic HCT and 1\u20136 % in autologous recipients. The use of ganciclovir for prophylaxis in the early posttransplant period has decreased the overall incidence to 5\u20138 % and has increased the proportion of disease occurring in the late transplant period (>100 days) [58]. Risk factors for developing late onset disease include CMV antigenemia in the first 3 months, delayed lymphocyte engraftment, low CD4 counts, and acute graft-versus-host disease [59]. In a single center retrospective review of 421 cases of CMV pneumonia over a 25 year span, the overall survival of HCT recipients after CMV pneumonia onset was approximately 30 %; treatment with IV ganciclovir or foscarnet was associated with decreased overall mortality of patients with CMV pneumonia over time. Not surprisingly, coinfection with other lung pathogens was associated with increased overall mortality. Lymphopenia and the use of mechanical ventilation at the time of CMV onset were independently associated with an increased risk of 6-month CMV-attributable mortality [60].",

Quantitative PCR from the BAL may have higher sensitivity for CMV and is now used by many centers; however, lack of an appropriate cutoff for the viral load limits the interpretation of positive results.

It is important to recognize that all clinically relevant azole antimicrobials inhibit cytochrome P450 isoenzyme activity to varying degrees resulting in increased serum concentrations of cyclosporine, tacrolimus, sirolimus and everolimus that could lead to neurotoxicity and/or nephrotoxicity. These medications must be dose-adjusted when the patient requires azole treatment for IFI [2]. Voriconazole, a broad-spectrum triazole derivative that became available in 2002, is the agent of choice for the treatment of IA based on its superior efficacy and survival benefit in comparison to amphotericin [77]. Liposomal amphotericin B is an alternative in patients who are azole intolerant. Echinocandins (caspofungin, micafungin, anidulafungin) are also an option for the treatment of IA and have very low potential for drug interactions although tacrolimus levels may be reduced. Surgical resection for focally invasive disease that is refractory to medical therapy can be considered in neutropenic patients. Inhaled liposomal amphotericin B, in addition to systemic antifungals, can be used for the treatment of fungal tracheobronchitis [2].",
