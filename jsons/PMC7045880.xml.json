Coronavirus belong to the family Coronaviridae, which comprises of alpha, beta, delta, and gamma coronaviruses [1,2]. As the name indicates, the spherical external spike protein displays a characteristic crown shape when observed under an electron microscope [3,4]. The virus is known to infect a wide range of hosts including humans, other mammals, and birds. Infected hosts exhibit different clinical courses, ranging from asymptomatic to severe symptoms in their respiratory, digestive, and genital organs [1,2]. There are 6 known coronaviruses that typically cause infection in humans. Among these, coronavirus 229E, OC43, NL63, and HKU1 generally cause mild cold-like symptoms, whereas severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2003, and Middle East respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012, caused severe respiratory diseases such as pneumonia and death [5,6].",

The SARS-CoV-2 was isolated from a Korean patient who had self-administered antipyretics for initial symptoms such as chills and fever. The patient had experienced intermittent coughing with sputum 3 days after the administration of antipyretics. The SARS-CoV-2 could replicate in other cells (Vero E6 and Caco-II cells), in addition to Vero cells (data not shown). The first SARS-CoV-2 was successfully isolated by inoculating human airway epithelial cells with bronchoalveolar-lavage fluid samples from a patient with pneumonia [16]. Since human airway epithelial cells (because of their resemblance to pseudostratified mucociliary epithelium) require 4\u20136 weeks to differentiate in vivo, isolation of SARS-CoV-2 using Vero cells or Caco-II cells is more convenient. Further studies are needed to select more sensitive cell lines suitable for virus isolation from low viral load samples.",

Results show that the isolate from Korea was clustered with the new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 and classified as betacoronavirus. High homology (99.94%\u201399.99%) was confirmed with the viral sequences reported from other countries, such as those from Wuhan/IVDC-HB-01/2019(GISAID accession ID: EPI_ISL_402119). Homology with bat CoV (bat-SL-CoVZC45), SARS-CoV (AY278741) and MERS-CoV (JX869059) was 89.1%, 77.5%, and 50%, respectively. However, the lowest homology of 99.5% was observed with BetaCoV/Wuwhan/IVDCHB-04/2020, which could be because of the inaccurate sequence of IVDCHB-04, Hence, it has been excluded from the comparative analysis in other studies.",

Since the release of the SARS-CoV-2 sequence, a real-time RT-PCR method has been established in the diagnosis of COVID-19 patients. Currently, the diagnosis of COVID-19 is based on gene detection via real-time RT-PCR.
