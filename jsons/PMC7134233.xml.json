Employee-driven innovation is founded upon the argument that organizations cannot ignore the innovative resources and potential of ordinary employees [2]. This new approach to innovation, although the underlying elements are not new, has been attracting more interest in recent years [3]. Looking into the subject shows that most of the research in the quest to understand employee-driven digital innovation has been done towards private organizations. But there exist knowledge gaps to the understanding of the phenomenon with regard to public organizations, not at least in relation to digital innovation. This brings us to our research questions for our study:R.Q.1: How do employee-driven digital innovation work in a public organization?R.Q.2: How to increase employee-driven digital innovation in a public organization?R.Q.3: How to introduce digital tools to support employee-driven digital innovation?\n",

Some researchers claim that organizations that are not interested in innovation to face the dynamic environments will apparently disappear [5]. Organizations seek to exploit the opportunities to innovate in pursuit of competitive advantages. Innovation is more than just a creation of an idea, it is also about idea-creation and idea-development (exploring), and how these can be utilized (exploited) through new product and service offerings [6]. Innovation in the public sector however is an area that has not been extensively studied before, and there is no common understanding of what innovation in public organizations is or developed a framework for understanding innovation within [7]. One reason for this might be the fundamental differences between public and private organizations that might affect their interest and ability to innovate, such as purpose and innovation focus. In recent years, several new approaches to innovation have emerged, including user-driven innovation and open innovation [8]. Lately we have also seen the emergence of employee-driven innovation [9]. The understanding of innovation, and how innovation develops in the organizations, is no longer limited to R&D units or experts. Innovation processes initiated by employees, and often in collaboration with the external ecosystem, are recognized. Because of these new approaches improved explanatory models are required to innovation.",

In employee-driven innovation, the focus is on utilizing the innovation potential that the organization has overall and, not least, the knowledge, skills and experience that the ordinary employees possess. Organizations increasingly recognize that innovation does not just happen exclusively through top-down decisions, internally by investing in R&D units or externally by pursuing open innovation or creating innovation hubs [11]. The core idea of employee-driven innovation is that by inciting cooperation between employees and managers, companies\u2019 innovation performance will improve greatly [1]. A bottom-up approach, like employee-driven innovation, might produce value to the organization by utilizing employee\u2019s knowledge, experience and ideas to provide continuous innovation. Changing environment and conditions in work life also underpin employee-driven innovation, as a growing number of innovations will be intangible and service oriented [12]. These changes, together with increasing focus on digital innovation, has created what we have chosen to call employee-driven digital innovation. Digital innovation can be understood as using digital technology during the process of innovation or that the outcome of the innovation is fully or partly digital [13]. When ordinary employees, through involvement in the innovation process, creating ideas and contributing to the realization of these, with elements of digital innovation, one can talk about employee-driven digital innovation. Despite the emerging interest in digital innovation, it emerges as a research area to the extent that it is not fully developed [14]. Digital innovation initiatives still need further theorization [14].",

Increasing focus on digital transformation has seen the rise of a new type of innovation which influences not only private but also public organizations [15]. Many have the misperception that the public sector does not engage in innovation practices, and at least not through the involvement of ordinary employees. However, the fact that public organizations do not have traditional R&D units, can emphasize the advantages employee-driven digital innovation can create [16]. Therefore, there seems to be a greater need to include these activities into the daily activities of these organizations. Knowledge is needed both in relation to the phenomenon in public organizations, and not at least how to make use of this way of practicing innovation throughout organizations.",

This is a diagnostic phase and contribute to the problem definition of employee-driven digital innovation. The problem formulation stage in ADR identifies and conceptualizes a research opportunity based on existing theories and technologies [4, 20]. Here we do that through the use of existing theory of employee-driven digital innovation. The data collection is done through the use of semi-structured interviews with respondents, including project leaders and project members, from three different ongoing employee-driven digital innovation projects. There will also be conducted semi-structured interviews with people holding other positions across the organization close to the different projects (support positions). These respondents both include the strategic level in the organization, as well as at the IT-department (programmers) who interact across the various digital innovation projects. This also gives us opportunities to compare between the different projects and increases the validity of the potential findings. This acquisition of knowledge will also be important when we face the stage of intervention later in the research design. These innovation projects are at different stages in the innovation process, which gives us different perspectives on the innovation process.",

This stage consists of building, intervening and evaluating [4] around the construct of employee-driven digital innovation, and will be a therapeutic phase. This stage heavily rests upon the framing and theoretical premises adopted at stage one [4]. Through this stage we will build further knowledge about the phenomenon of employee-driven digital innovation and do interventions through the use of focus groups to increase adoption in parts of the organization that have not yet adopted and implemented the innovation practice. This stage will create knowledge about best practices of employee-driven digital innovation in public organizations that also can be used in stage four to create general solution concepts. The design of the model/construct/approach for how to increase the adoption of employee-driven digital innovation in the organization must be done in close collaboration with the employees and management of the organization. This also applies for introduction of digital tools to support this innovation practice. The outcome of stage two of the ADR is the realized design of the artifact [4]. This type of research is aimed at changing the organization\u2019s practice, and not just studying the phenomenon from an outside perspective [19]. There is also conceivable to apply iterations to the ADR method at stage one and two. This will give the possibilities of further developing knowledge and practices about adoption of employee-driven digital innovation in the organization and how introduction of digital tools to support it can be done [22]. This building of knowledge and practices will also contribute to the reflection and learning in stage three in the ADR method.",

Our main goal of the study is to increase the knowledge and understanding of employee-driven digital innovation in a public organization. There is reason to believe that employee-driven digital innovation in private and public organizations might have differences in terms of factors (e.g. innovation focus and tasks) affecting employees\u2019 willingness to participate in the innovation process. One of the reasons for this may be that innovation in public organizations is based on providing the best and most effective services to the citizens, while in private organizations it is based on innovating with a view to products and services that will maximize profits. These differences in basic assumptions in the organizations can influence how innovation processes are adopted, implemented and practiced, and not least the outcomes. It may also be that factors known as basis for creating employee-driven innovation in private organizations; as autonomy, organizations innovation focus, willingness to collaborate, etc., may appear different in the context of public organizations. We believe that using ADR, with the possibilities of numerous iterations at stage two, will give a better understanding of employee-driven digital innovation in a public organization, and provide the ability to create general solution concepts of how to increase adoption and digital supporting tools that are more applicable then the use of any other research methods.",
