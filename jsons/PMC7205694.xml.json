First, postponement of urological consultations carries a risk of potential rebound attendances in worsened condition and larger numbers. Our hospital implemented measures in anticipation of this, reviewing and triaging [2], [3] all scheduled appointments and adopting telemedicine strategies including phone consultations and prescriptions (with courier delivery), a huge endeavour given the sheer volume of ambulatory patients. Second, the pandemic-related decrease in ED consultations is a reminder of the delicate balance in managing urological conditions in the community and tertiary settings.",

A review of our data set revealed that the decrease in urolithiasis consultations reported by Mantica et al is similar to our reduction in urolithiasis admissions. We postulate that during the COVID-19 pandemic, Singapore patients were preferentially seeking conservative care in the community or deferring consultations. This is in contrast to the higher percentage of haematuria cases noted by Mantica et al, similar to the higher percentage of genitourinary infections we observed, as these conditions can seldom be deferred. Importantly, we must further analyse if this percentage rise in infections and haematuria is a consequence of delayed health-seeking behaviour or of failed treatment in the community. Our data set is unable to definitively determine if ED abuse was the case, but with rigorous admission criteria we can prevent unnecessary admissions and preserve inpatient resources.",

If urologists act quickly in anticipating post-COVID-19 issues and in using this pandemic to review reforms for our health care systems, we can emerge stronger than before.",
