Researches on diffusion are focusing on network modeling for studying spreading phenomena. While the impact of network properties on spreading is now widely studied, involvement of network dynamicity is very little known. In this paper, we address the epidemiology context and study the consequences of network evolutions on spread of diseases. Experiments are conducted by comparing incidence curves obtained by evolution strategies applied on two generated and two real networks. Results are then analyzed by investigating network properties and discussed in order to explain how network evolution influences the spread. We present the MIDEN framework, an approach to measure impact of basic changes in network structure, and DynSpread, a 2D simulation tool designed to replay infections scenarios on evolving networks. This work is focused on diffusion phenomenon and addresses the particular issue of spread of diseases. Indeed, in numerous cases of disease spreading, social contacts seem to be main factors of transmission. Sexual Transmitted Diseases (STDs) are a good example of diseases that depend solely on personal contacts for dissemination. Thus, several studies have focused on social networks and have demonstrated their relevance in disease spreading [18, 9, 7] . However, although the effect of network properties on spreading is now widely studied, the impact of network changes is an emerging field. One obvious pitfall is the lack of real data and most works commonly handle snapshots of a network at a given time, that do not fully reflect real world networks.",

Unlike methods that study spreading on static networks, we propose a framework to assess impact of evolving mechanisms, by selecting and comparing some typical evolution strategies. Experiments are conducted by comparing incidence curves obtained with several evolution strategies and are then analyzed by investigating network properties. In this first stage, we have restricted the analysis to strategies thats only create new links. Our results provide an original insight about how and why network evolution impacts the spread. We show indeed that new links appearing in the social network generally emphasis the epidemic spread and speed up the process. Of course this assertion has to be modulated according to the evolution strategy applied. In epidemiology, understanding such implications is essential to help public health officials in the prevention and the development of appropriate strategies taking into account changes occurring on real world networks.",
