In patients with risk factors and clinical and/or radiographic features that are suggestive of invasive aspergillosis, culture of Aspergillus spp. from respiratory secretions provides adequate evidence of invasive disease. Aspergillus is a rapidly growing fungus in the laboratory and is often visible in culture within a few days of incubation [4]. However, identification of the species requires sporulation in order to microscopically examine spore-bearing structures. The positive predictive value was highest in BAL cultures and is dependent upon both the host and the clinical presentation [10]. In a study that evaluated the predictive value of lower respiratory tract cultures in different patient populations with probable or proven invasive pulmonary aspergillosis, the positive predictive value was highest in hematopoietic cell transplant recipients, patients with hematological malignancies, and granulocytopenic patients [11, 12].",

Even more recent assays that use a double-sandwich enzyme immunoassay (EIA) have higher sensitivity and are available for use on serum samples as an adjunctive test for the diagnosis of aspergillosis [12, 13]. The galactomannan EIA is performed with an optical readout that is interpreted as a ratio relative to the optical density (OD) of a threshold control provided by the manufacturer, which is called the OD index [13]. The assay has a suggested threshold OD index of 0.5; thus, an OD index \u22650.5 is considered to be a positive result. As reported in our patient, the index was 3.09. When combining proven and probable cases, the sensitivity and specificity were 61 % (95 % CI 59\u201363 %) and 93 % (95 % CI 92\u201394 %), respectively [11\u201313].

            "text": "The 1,3-beta-d-glucan, another cell wall component of many fungi, is detected by the beta-d-glucan assay [14]. The output of the serum assay currently is based on spectrophotometer readings, in which optical density is converted to beta-d-glucan concentrations; the results are interpreted as negative (range <60 pg/ml), indeterminate (60\u201379 pg/ml), or positive (>80 pg/ml) [14, 15]. Our patient has a beta-d-glucan level of 947 pg/ml. Importantly, these cutoffs were defined in the clinical context of identifying breakthrough invasive fungal infections (primarily, invasive candidiasis) in people who were undergoing treatment for hematologic malignancies, which was reported above with an massive elevated beta-d-glucan level. Precise cutoffs to optimize the performance of the assay as an aid to diagnose invasive aspergillosis have not been defined and may be different [15]. A meta-analysis that included six cohort studies of patients with hematologic malignancies noted a lower sensitivity (50 %, 95 % CI 34\u201365 %) and a higher specificity (99 %, 95 % CI 97\u2013100 %) on probable invasive aspergillosis than previously reported [16]. Despite the substantial heterogeneity among different studies, the beta-d-glucan assay has good accuracy for distinguishing patients with proven or probable invasive fungal infections from patients without invasive fungal infection [16, 17]. The beta-d-glucan assay may be used for detecting invasive fungal infections early in the course of infection, prior to the onset of overt clinical findings. Although the best results using the 1,3-beta-d-glucan assay are in diagnosing invasive candidiasis and aspergillosis, there are also small reports in detecting uncommon fungal diseases such as Scedosporium spp. [18].",
