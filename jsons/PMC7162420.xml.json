On one hand, these structures serve as platforms to concentrate all the components required during replication and transcription, and on the other, they provide a physical separation to protect the viral RNA, specifically the double\u2010stranded RNA (dsRNA), generated as a replication intermediate, from the detection by the host antiviral defences. Many morphological, ultrastructural and biochemical studies have been performed during the last decade to characterize the RTCs from different virus families (Miller and Krijnse\u2010Locker, 2008; den Boon and Ahlquist, 2010; Netherton and Wileman, 2011; Harak and Lohmann, 2015).",

Four torovirus species have been described: equine torovirus, also known as Berne virus (BEV) (Weiss et al., 1983), bovine torovirus (BToV), porcine torovirus and human torovirus (http://ictvonline.org/virusTaxonomy.asp). Only BEV, the prototype member of the genus, has been studied at the molecular level, as, for a long time, it was the only strain of torovirus that could be grown in cell culture. Nonetheless, the propagation of different BToV strains has also been reported (Kuwabara et al., 2007; Ito et al., 2010; Aita et al., 2012).",

            "text": "The torovirus genomic organization is similar to that of all other nidoviruses. The last third of the viral genome encodes the structural proteins: spike (S), membrane (M), haemagglutinin\u2010esterase (HE), whose coding gene is partially deleted in BEV (Snijder et al., 1991), and nucleocapsid (N) (Snijder and Horzinek, 1993), which are individually expressed from a nested set of subgenomic messenger RNAs. As in all nidoviruses, the first two\u2010thirds of the torovirus genome are occupied by two large and overlapping open reading frames (ORFs), ORF1a and ORF1b, which encode two partially overlapping replicase polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab, of 4569 and 6857 amino acids, respectively (http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P0C6V7), that are translated from the genomic RNA. Expression of the pp1ab C\u2010terminal end is produced by a ribosomal frameshifting occurring just upstream of the ORF1a stop codon (Brierley et al., 1989; Snijder et al., 1990; den Boon et al., 1991; Siddell et al., 2010). Among the nidoviruses, the most conserved domain is found in the ORF1b, which includes key enzymes in the viral RNA replication and transcription, like the RNA\u2010dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and the helicase (Hel) among others (Gorbalenya et al., 2006). The mature non\u2010structural proteins (nsps) are post\u2010translationally released from the replicase polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab by the viral proteinases (Ziebuhr et al., 2000), the papain\u2010like proteinase and the main proteinase (Mpro), a chymotrypsin\u2010like proteinase responsible for most of the post\u2010translational cleavages. In BEV, this region has been poorly characterized, and thus, the presence of putative functional domains in the torovirus polyproteins has only been predicted by comparative amino acid sequence analysis with other nidoviruses (Snijder et al., 1990; Smits et al., 2006). The BEV Mpro is the only torovirus nsp that has been characterized biochemically to date (Smits et al., 2006). The BEV Mpro is a serine proteinase, like those of arteriviruses (Snijder et al., 1996; Barrette\u2010Ng et al., 2002) and the related bafiniviruses (Ulferts et al., 2011), but differs from the coronavirus and ronivirus Mpro (Ziebuhr et al., 2000; Hegyi et al., 2002), which are cysteine proteinase. Based on the sequence specificity, Smits et al. (2006) proposed a tentative processing scheme for the BEV pp1a/pp1ab polyproteins, where the sequence and localization of the potential cleavage sites of Mpro were shown. Also, they pointed out the conservation of the cleavage sites in the BToV sequence published by Draker et al. (2006).",

            "text": "A common characteristic of all known nidoviruses, which is also conserved in torovirus, is the presence of three hydrophobic domains in the pp1a/pp1ab polyproteins (Gorbalenya et al., 2006). The first domain is localized near the papain\u2010like proteinase, and the other two are flanking the Mpro domain. These hydrophobic domains are believed to anchor the RTCs to intracellular membranes and are proposed to be responsible for the membrane rearrangement produced during the viral infection (Snijder et al., 2001; Clementz et al., 2008; Gadlage et al., 2010; Angelini et al., 2013). In this regard, characteristic double\u2010membrane vesicles (DMVs) that have been related with the replication/transcription processes have been observed in the cytoplasm of cells infected with different nidoviruses. Specifically, DMVs were observed in cells infected with several betacoronaviruses, i.e. severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS\u2010CoV) (Snijder et al., 2006), mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) (Gosert et al., 2002; Ulasli et al., 2010) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS\u2010CoV) (de Wilde et al., 2013), as well as with members of the Alphacoronavirus (NL63\u2010CoV) (Orenstein et al., 2008) and Gammacoronavirus [infectious bronchitis virus (IBV)] (Maier et al., 2013) genera, and with the arterivirus equine arteritis virus (EAV) (Pedersen et al., 1999). Furthermore, the presence of other membranous structures related to the replication/transcription processes was described, such as convoluted membranes (Knoops et al., 2008; Ulasli et al., 2010; de Wilde et al., 2013) or spherules (Maier et al., 2013). Electron tomography studies performed with SARS\u2010CoV (Knoops et al., 2008) and EAV (Knoops et al., 2012) indicate that actually the DMVs form part of a reticulovesicular network of modified membranes derived from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) that supports the viral replication machinery.",

            "text": "Accumulating evidences from different positive\u2010strand RNA viruses indicate that in this heterogeneous group of viruses, genomic RNA replication and transcription invariably occur in close association with highly modified cellular membranes of diverse origins. It has been shown that in cells infected with different nidoviruses, virus\u2010induced membrane reorganization produces characteristic DMVs, as well as other membranous structures, which have been related with the viral RNA replication and transcription processes. However, nothing is known about membrane rearrangements occurring in torovirus\u2010infected cells. Here, E.Derm cells mock infected or infected with BEV for 16 h were subjected to conventional embedding in TAAB\u2010812 epoxy resin and analysed by TEM. In thin sections of infected cells groups of DMVs were observed in the cell cytoplasm, frequently in the perinuclear area and surrounded by mitochondria and ER membranes (Fig. 1A and B). These membranous structures were not observed in mock\u2010infected cells (not shown). As shown in Fig. 1, vesicles of different sizes could be observed, ranging from 50 to 150 nm in diameter, but in some cases, large DMVs, bigger than 200 nm, were also seen. Moreover, while some DMVs appeared as empty vesicles, in others, an electron\u2010dense inner content could be observed. Apparently, the DMVs look as independent structures isolated from each other; however, an in\u2010depth inspection of the infected cells revealed the existence of connections between many of them, as well as between DMVs and the ER (Fig. 1C and D). In addition, a seeming continuity between DMVs and the mitochondrial\u2010associated ER membranes (MAM) could occasionally be observed (Fig. 1E and F). The MAM is a subdomain of the ER with different properties and lipid composition, which regulates ER\u2013mitochondria communications and appears as ER tubules closely apposed to mitochondria on the electron micrographs (Raturi and Simmen, 2013). Although some virions could be seen inside rough ER\u2010derived vesicles close to the DMV clusters (Figs 1B and S1A and B), at this time post infection (pi), most viral particles appeared accumulated in large vesicles (Fig. S1C), usually segregated from these areas.",

Although the freeze substitution protocols have been previously described to improve the preservation of DMVs in other nidoviruses (Snijder et al., 2006; Knoops et al., 2012), the BEV DMVs were barely identified under these conditions (Fig. 2A and B); nonetheless, those that could be recognized showed a dense inner content. On the other hand, in cryosections from BEV\u2010infected E. Derm, DMVs were clearly seen (Fig. 2C and D). As observed in conventional sections of epoxy resin, the DMVs were mainly localized in the perinuclear area and were surrounded by mitochondria and ER membranes. We did not observe differences in the DMV sizes when compared with those observed in epoxy sections; however, in the cryosections, the inner content of most of the DMVs was preserved. Also, some viral particles could be observed in the vicinity of DMV clusters, but in separate areas (Fig. 2C). However, the large clusters of convoluted membranes found in several coronavirus were not observed in the case of BEV infection. Similarly, there was no evidence of spherules, like those recently described in IBV\u2010infected cells.",

As exemplified in Fig. 3A for Mpro, for all of them, the first signal was observed between 4 and 6 h pi, but it increased in intensity from 8 h pi onwards.

These quantitative studies indicated a quite high degree of colocalization between the BEV nsps, with an r for the Hel\u2010Mpro pair of 0.78 \u00b1 0.04 at 8 h pi, 0.76 \u00b1 0.03 at 12 h pi and 0.65 \u00b1 0.04 at 16 h pi. Similar values were obtained for the RdRp\u2013Mpro pair, with an r of 0.75 \u00b1 0.03 at 8 h pi, 0.82 \u00b1 0.02 at 12 h pi and 0.70 \u00b1 0.03 at 16 h pi. These results confirm that the Hel, the RdRp and the Mpro are localized in the same areas, which likely represent the sites where the viral replication and transcription occur.",

Previously, we described that at early times pi the M protein accumulates at the perinuclear area, specifically within the ER\u2013Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) where the virus assembly is thought to occur, and at later times, the signal corresponding to the M protein spreads towards the cell surface once the protein was incorporated into the progeny virions (Garzon et al., 2006). Figure 4C shows that the M protein does not colocalize with the Mpro at 8 h pi. Both proteins showed different distributions along the infection as confirmed by the quantitative colocalization study that gave r values lower than 0.5 (0.22 \u00b1 0.03 at 8 h pi, 0.27 \u00b1 0.03 at 12 h pi and 0.24 \u00b1 0.06 at 16 h pi) (Fig. 4D). The analysis was extended to the S and N structural proteins with similar results, although there could be a certain degree of colocalization between N and Mpro at an earlier time point (6 h pi) (data not shown). The lack of colocalization between the structural proteins and the nsps indicates that the sites of viral replication are separated from the sites of virus assembly.",

To determine whether in BEV\u2010infected cells the nsps are located at the sites of viral RNA synthesis, we used an anti\u2010dsRNA monoclonal antibody (mAb). E.Derm cells infected with BEV were fixed at 8, 12 and 16 h pi and stained with the anti\u2010dsRNA and anti\u2010Mpro antibodies. The dsRNA staining was detected in bright dots, whose number increases along the infection, reaching a steady state at about 10 h pi (data not shown). We did not observe clear colocalization between Mpro and dsRNA at any time pi, as exemplified in Fig. 5A for 8 h pi and as determined by the quantitative analysis that showed r values below 0.5 at either time pi analysed in this assay (0.13 \u00b1 0.03 at 8 h pi, 0.13 \u00b1 0.02 at 12 h pi and 0.10 \u00b1 0.01 at 16 h pi) (Fig. 5C). Nonetheless, although the dsRNA and Mpro signals could not be superimposed, we observed that they were very close to each other in many areas, in fact, about 50% of dsRNA dots exhibited a partial colocalization or were surrounded by the Mpro signal.",

As was expected, the results obtained did not differ significantly from those obtained with the Mpro (Figs 5C and S3). These results are in agreement with those obtained with other nidoviruses, where only a partial colocalization was found between the dsRNA and nsps (Knoops et al., 2008; Hagemeijer et al., 2012; Knoops et al., 2012; Maier et al., 2013). However, for EAV and MHV, there has been described a slight colocalization between the dsRNA and nsps but only at early times pi (Hagemeijer et al., 2012; Knoops et al., 2012).

For this, E.Derm cells infected with BEV were treated with actinomycin D to block host cell messenger RNA synthesis and simultaneously incubated with 5\u2010bromouridine (5\u2010BrU) for 1 h before fixation, as described in the Experimental Procedures section. The nascent RNA immunolabelled with anti\u2010BrdU\u2010specific antibodies exhibited a staining pattern very similar to those of the nsps (Fig. S4). The signal associated to the newly synthesized RNA was first detected between 4 and 6 h pi, was more apparent from 8 h pi, and kept increasing along the infection until 16\u201318 h pi, at which time RNA synthesis was turned off in many cells (Fig. S4). This result indicates that viral RNA synthesis takes place mainly between 8 and 12 h pi and ceases at around 16 h pi. As shown in Fig. 5B, in cells stained with anti\u2010BrdU and anti\u2010Mpro specific antibodies, a clear colocalization was observed between the nascent RNA (BrU\u2010RNA) and Mpro at 8 h pi. The r values for the BrU\u2010RNA\u2010Mpro pair at 8 and 12 h pi were of 0.57 \u00b1 0.02 and 0.58 \u00b1 0.02 respectively (Fig. 5C). However, at 16 h pi we observed an r value slightly below 0.5 (0.48 \u00b1 0.06). This low value could be explained by the shutoff of RNA synthesis in some cells at this time pi, since in those cells where the BrU\u2010RNA signal was still observed at 16 h pi, the r value was similar to those obtained at 8 or 12 h pi.",

Interestingly, we observed that at 8 h pi those Mpro\u2010negative and BrU\u2010RNA\u2010positive sites were also positive for the structural M protein (Fig. S5).

Only some DMVs are labelled, probably as a consequence of a loss of material due to the mild fixation conditions used to preserve the antigenicity, but the signal was exclusively localized in the interior of these DMVs. A different pattern was observed when cryosections were labelled with antibodies directed against the RdRp (Fig. 6A, middle panels) or Mpro (Fig. 6A, right panels). We observed that the RdRp and Mpro polypeptides were clearly localized at DMV clusters, specifically associated to DMV membranes as well as to the adjacent membranes, while the interior of DMVs was mainly devoid of signal, although occasionally we observed some labelling within the DMV interior. When the same antibodies were used in parallel with cryosections of mock\u2010infected cells, only a few scattered gold particles could be observed in each case, indicating the specificity of the immunolabelling observed (Fig. S6).",

First, we carried out an ultrastructural study to analyse the cellular membrane rearrangements elicited upon torovirus infection. The presence of characteristic DMVs within the cytoplasm of cells infected with BEV was observed both in equine E.Derm cells and in human MRC5 cells, treated under different preservation conditions, such as conventional chemical fixation or cryofixation. However, the BEV DMVs were poorly visualized under the cryofixation and freeze substitution conditions used in this study. A cryofixation and freeze substitution method was previously used by Snijder et al. (2006) to improve the preservation of DMVs in SARS\u2010CoV\u2010infected cells for their examination by TEM, and later utilized for electron tomography studies, with some minor changes (Knoops et al., 2008). The same group described the presence of DMVs in EAV\u2010infected cells using a similar protocol; however, for the tomography assays, they included high\u2010pressure freezing before freeze substitution (HPF\u2010FS) to further improve DMV preservation (Knoops et al., 2012). In our assay, the membranes appeared poorly contrasted by this technique, probably owing to differences in the cryofixation and embedding conditions with regard to the protocols used for SARS\u2010CoV and EAV. Although the HPF\u2010FS has been recognized as an efficient technique for preserving DMVs (Limpens et al., 2011; Knoops et al., 2012; Romero\u2010Brey et al., 2012; Maier et al., 2013), the embedding in epoxy resin TAAB\u2010812 protocol used in these assays provided a high preservation of the cellular structures as well as of the DMVs, which exhibit the spherical shape similar to that previously observed in other nidoviruses. Moreover, the great ultrastructural preservation achieved in this study allows us to clearly distinguish the two tightly apposed membranes of the DMVs, most of which show an electron\u2010dense inner content, as well as to visualize membranous connections among different DMVs and between DMVs and ER membranes.",

Nonetheless, a more sophisticated ultrastructural analysis would be required to confirm the existence of this network. An apparent difference with SARS\u2010CoV (Knoops et al., 2008) or EAV (Knoops et al., 2012) was the absence of ribosomes associated to the outer membranes of the BEV DMVs.

The absence of convoluted membranes in torovirus, as well as in cells infected with EAV (van Hemert et al., 2008) or IBV (Maier et al., 2013), supports the idea that these structures are specific to betacoronaviruses. Likewise, the spherules recently described for IBV (Maier et al., 2013) were not observed in our study. Nonetheless, we cannot rule out the presence of these structures in the BEV\u2010infected cells because their appearance in two\u2010dimensional ultrastructural studies is very similar to that of the DMVs, and, therefore, the application of 3D studies is essential to elucidate the presence or the absence of spherules in BEV\u2010infected cell.",

Concerning this, we observed clusters of DMVs with apparent continuity with ER tubules closely apposed to mitochondria, which might represent the areas of communication between these two organelles, known as MAMs. Recently, Friesland et al. (2013) have suggested that the membranes of the MAM could serve as platforms for initial RNA replication during hepatitis C virus infection, a virus that induces DMVs with similar characteristics to those produced by nidoviruses. The interaction between virus replication factories and MAMs is probably due to the fact that viruses need the energy produced by the mitochondria for their processes, and hence, the formation of their replicative platforms from MAMs could be advantageous to obtain this energy. Moreover, MAMs play a major role in lipid metabolism, a function that could be essential for the membrane remodelling process induced by the virus. However, biochemical assays are indispensable to confirm the implication of MAMs with the DMVs of BEV.",

            "text": "To investigate whether torovirus DMVs are the sites where replication and transcription occur, we obtained specific sera for the BEV Mpro, Hel and RdRp, three key proteins in the formation and functioning of RTCs. All showed a high colocalization with each other and with newly synthesized RNAs. However, the dsRNA, widely used as a marker of RTC in several positive\u2010strand RNA viruses, only showed a partial colocalization with the nsps. A 3D reconstruction of confocal images showed that part of the dsRNA is localized inside the volume occupied by the Mpro. Additionally, the immunolabelling assays on cryosections indicated that the nsps are associated to DMV membranes or to the adjacent membranes, while the dsRNA was exclusively detected inside DMVs. An apparent separation between the bulk of the nsps and most of the dsRNA was previously described for other nidoviruses (Knoops et al., 2008; 2012; Maier et al., 2013). Therefore, in nidoviruses, the relationship between the sites of dsRNA accumulation and RTCs remains an open question. The apparent absence of pores connecting the interior of DMVs with the cytoplasm and the presence of dsRNA inside of these DMVs, as well as the lack of colocalization with replicase proteins, suggested the idea that many DMVs are not actively involved in RNA synthesis and might instead represent shielding structures that protect the dsRNA molecules from the detection by the innate immune sensors (Hagemeijer et al., 2012). Other authors consider that a huge excess of nsps may be produced in virus\u2010infected cells, with only a fraction of these molecules actively participating in viral RNA synthesis (Knoops et al., 2008). We believe that the DMVs formed in torovirus\u2010infected cells are the sites where the replication and transcription occur. By confocal microscopy, we observed a clear colocalization between the newly synthesized RNA and the nsps, but attempts to perform similar studies by immunoelectronmicroscopy were unsuccessful. On the other hand, it has to be considered that the colocalization between the newly synthesized RNA and nsps does not necessarily imply that those are areas of active replication exclusively; they can also represent sites of protein translation, as it probably occurs in the regions that are positive for the nascent RNA and the M protein (Fig. S5). Colocalization studies between the dsRNA and the newly synthesized RNA could help to resolve this question. Our attempts to perform these assays have failed because of the unavailability of an adequate combination of antibodies for the double labelling. Similar assays were performed in MHV\u2010infected cells, where the dsRNA and an analogue of uridine, EU, were placed at closely adjacent locations, but only at an early time pi (Hagemeijer et al., 2012). Similar results were described for EAV (Knoops et al., 2012), where a limited colocalization between the nsps and dsRNA was described at an early time pi. In this regard, we did not observe colocalization of the BEV nsps characterized here with the dsRNA at any time of infection, although the signals observed by confocal microscopy corresponding to nsps and dsRNA were closely juxtaposed in many areas at all pi times analysed.",

Furthermore, the TEM assays show a high amount of viral particles enclosed in vesicles physically separated from the sites where the DMVs are localized. Similarly, in SARS\u2010CoV\u2010infected cells, the separation between the RTC factories and the sites of virus assembly has been described (Snijder et al., 2006).",

None of the markers used in these confocal microscopy assays, to identify early endosomes, Golgi, ERGIC, lysosomes, ER, mitochondria or MAM, showed a clear colocalization with the Mpro protein. However PDI, calnexin, MitoTracker and S1R, markers of ER, mitochondria and MAM respectively, were found surrounding the Mpro signal or even partially colocalizing with it. These results together with the fact that the TEM assays showed that the DMVs are connected with the ER, and probably with the MAM, lead us to believe that the membranes of this organelle are the donors for the DMV formation. The absence of colocalization between the traditional ER markers and nsps may be due to the high accumulation of BEV nsps in this region, which could promote the exclusion of these cellular proteins. The origin of the rearranged membranes produced by the studied coronaviruses for their replication is also in question. From the TEM assays, it appears that coronaviruses subvert the ER membrane to establish their replication factories. However, the absence of conventional ER markers in virus\u2010induced membranous structures (Snijder et al., 2006; Ulasli et al., 2010) makes it difficult to undoubtedly establish their origin. Only colocalization with the ER protein sec61 and a partial colocalization with PDI were reported (Knoops et al., 2010). Some studies indicated that the origin is found in specific organelles derived from the ER, like the autophagosome. By their very nature, DMVs resemble cellular autophagosomes generated during the cellular autophagy process. Nonetheless, the relationship between DMV formation and autophagy is not clear, as although it has been shown that some coronaviruses induce autophagy (Prentice et al., 2004; Snijder et al., 2006), this process is not required for virus replication (Zhao et al., 2007; Schneider et al., 2012). Furthermore, it has been described that the coronavirus nsp6 protein generates autophagosomes from the ER via an omegasome intermediate (Cottam et al., 2011). The relationship between BEV and the autophagy pathway is as yet unknown, but we have some ongoing work to clarify this issue. Recent reports described an autophagy\u2010independent role for LC3 in several nidovirus infections, where the ER\u2010derived membranes of EDEMosomes may be the platform for virus replication, showing that the RTCs of MHV and EAV colocalize with markers for cellular EDEMosomes, as EDEM1 and OS\u20109. Our attempts to explore this possibility in BEV\u2010infected cells were inconclusive.",
