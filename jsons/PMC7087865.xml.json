All known mammalian cystatins are composed of at least one 100- to 120-amino-acid-residue domain with conserved sequence motifs [25]. Of the 12 human cystatins known, cystatin C is the most extensively studied one, showing a wide-spectrum inhibition profile and high-affinity binding to most C1 cysteine proteases [2].",

Many different tissues express cystatin C [5], and, as expected for an excreted protein, cystatin C has been detected in all body fluids examined. It is in fact the dominating cysteine protease inhibitor in most mammalian body fluids, present in amounts sufficiently high to allow it to control the extracellular activities of cathepsin B and other important cysteine proteases of family C1 [3]. However, some results imply that cystatin C can be biologically active also intracellularly. For example, cystatins are able to inhibit intracellular replication of polio, herpes simplex and corona viruses [8, 12, 19] as well as virus-induced apoptosis [9]. It is currently not understood how this is achieved.",

            "text": "Being the most important of the regulators of cysteine proteases, the cystatins are likely to play key roles in several normal and pathological states and reactions [2]. Cystatins not only have the capacity to regulate normal body processes and perhaps cause disease when downregulated, but may also participate in the defense against microbial infections. Little is known about its function in the eye, but cystatin C has been detected at both the RNA and protein levels in several ocular tissues, and expressed sequence tags (ESTs) of cystatin C, as well as the protein itself, are particularly prominent in the retinal pigment epithelium [15, 22\u201324, 27, 28]. Cystatin C mRNA was in one study also detected with in situ hybridization in the neuroretina and sclera [6], but not in the cornea, ciliary body, iris, lens, or choroid, where the protein occurs at significant levels [27, 28]. The discrepancies between the cellular localization of the cystatin C protein and the reported localization of cystatin C mRNA suggest that cystatin C produced in the retina and in cells of the anterior segment is perhaps secreted by some cells and then taken up by the same or neighboring cells, a previously not explored possibility. Since this might explain intracellular activities of cystatin C, and since we have recently seen a putative cellular uptake system for cystatin C in mouse macrophages [H\u00e5kansson, Wass\u00e9lius, Wallin, Ehinger and Abrahamson, unpublished], we chose to look for such a system also in the eye, as well as in other organs. Our results suggest that there is a previously unrecognized active, high-affinity cystatin C uptake system in several ocular cell types, predominantly epithelial cells.",

The cystatin C concentration in the purified fraction of labeled protein was determined by A280 measurement [20], Coomassie binding assay with reagent from Pierce (Rockford, IL, USA) [10], and active-site titration of papain [1] to ascertain that the labeled protein was inhibitorily active.

Furthermore, we used a polyclonal cystatin C antibody that recognizes human as well as rat cystatin C [28], labeling both endogenous and administered cystatin C, allowing us to see whether there were cells containing rat cystatin C that had not taken up the labeled human cystatin C.

We here show that several of the same cell types in the cornea, ciliary body, and retina of the rat eye in vivo have the capability to take up and store recombinant human cystatin C injected into the vitreous body. The uptake is demonstrable by both histochemistry and a double-sandwich ELISA, and since the results with the two methods agree well and the ELISA does not detect cystatin C fragments, we believe it likely that the fluorescence microscopy essentially shows the distribution of unchanged cystatin C.",

It is thus within a physiological concentration range. When characterizing the uptake system in a retina in vitro culturing system, we found that the uptake of cystatin C can be inhibited by culturing the retina at +4\u00b0C or by preincubating the retina with the microfilament polymerization inhibitor, cytochalasin D. This is as expected for an active uptake system. Furthermore, in a pilot experiment we observed that cystatin C injected into the peritoneal cavity of cystatin C knockout mice can be transferred into the systemic circulation and taken up by other tissues, including the retina. Taken together, the results indicate that a physiologically relevant active cellular uptake system for cystatin C exists in ocular tissues. To our knowledge, no such uptake system has previously been described for cystatins in mammalian cells or tissues.",

The presence of cystatin C mRNA in the cornea, the ciliary body, and the retina shows that the cystatin C gene is transcribed in these tissues. It is thus possible that cystatin C is secreted and taken up by the same cells that produce it and/or by neighboring cells. We find it worth noting that this is what is actually required for an efficient and tightly regulated control system: cystatin C is released when needed extracellularly, and when no longer needed, it is taken back up into cell stores from which it can be reused.",
