The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that measles vaccination programs alone have prevented over 21.1 million deaths globally between 2000 and 2017. Nevertheless, measles are still among the leading causes of childhood mortality worldwide [1] . However, especially in industrialized countries, it seems as though vaccines are about to become a victim of their own success where regionally successful vaccination programs have rendered the respective disease virtually unknown to the protected group [2] . As the general public typically does not witness the devastating manifestations of vaccine-preventable infectious diseases anymore, the consequences of contracting such a disease are often underestimated, and adherence to vaccination programs tends to diminish. This has led the WHO to list vaccine hesitancy among the top ten threats to global health in 2019.",

This global imbalance is particularly ethically relevant, as vaccine-preventable communicable diseases may be exported from financially prosperous countries with good medical infrastructure via global migration, tourism, and trade to countries less equipped to deal with outbreaks (for instance due to problems in vaccine coverage and limited treatment options for infectious diseases). Thus, low-income countries are disproportionately affected and are far more likely to suffer serious repercussions. This situation is exacerbated by an often worse disease outcome due to prevalent malnutrition and pre-existing chronic health conditions such as tuberculosis and HIV. Consequently, neglect or refusal to be vaccinated for non-medical reasons in countries where safe and efficient measles vaccines are easily available, does not only compromise herd immunity locally, but also fails to protect more vulnerable populations globally.",

To accelerate this process, the WHO is tasked with designing coordinated international public health strategies, assigning responsibilities to the national and regional levels. In this context, the international eradication of smallpox, declared by the WHO in 1980, cannot only be perceived as a historic grand success for global health, but also as a lasting contribution to transgenerational justice. Wherever feasible in terms of the pathogen' s biological properties, logistics, and safety, this process should be reproduced with a strategy adapted to the given epidemiological challenges.",

All health care authorities are obliged to provide the means to do so, and if unable from their own resources, with access to supranational support.

However, a mandatory vaccination policy for certain occupational groups at increased risk of contracting vaccine-preventable infectious diseases certainly makes sense.
