Here, we review fundamental aspects of NAD + biology and discuss evidence for a role of NAD + imbalance in the pathogenesis of acute kidney injury (AKI) and chronic kidney disease (CKD).

The highly metabolically active cells of the renal tubule also pair their energetic needs to the regulation of diverse cellular processes, including energy generation, antioxidant responses, autophagy and mitochondrial quality control. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD + ) is essential not only for the harvesting of energy from substrates but also for an array of regulatory reactions that determine cellular health. In acute kidney injury (AKI), substantial decreases in the levels of NAD + impair energy generation and, ultimately , the core kidney function of selective solute transport. Conversely , augmentation of NAD + may protect the kidney tubule against diverse acute stressors. For example, NAD + augmentation can ameliorate experimental AKI triggered by ischaemia-reperfusion, toxic injury and systemic inflammation. NAD + -dependent maintenance of renal tubular metabolic health may also attenuate long-term profibrotic responses that could lead to chronic kidney disease. Further understanding of the genetic, environmental and nutritional factors that influence NAD + biosynthesis and renal resilience may lead to novel approaches for the prevention and treatment of kidney disease.",

Seven different sirtuins have been identified in mammals, each with distinct cellular localization and function. For example, SIRT1 is primarily located in the nucleus where it is associated with euchromatin, whereas SIRT3-5 are primarily mitochondrial 12 . Sirtuins are involved in many reactions that regulate cellular metabolism through the NAD + -dependent deacetylation or deacylation of proteins including histones, such as H3, H4 and H1, transcription factors and co-activators, including p53, NF-\u03baB, PPAR\u03b3 co-activator 1\u03b1 (PGC1\u03b1) and FOXO1, and signalling regulators of metabolism, including protein kinase A, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) 13 . Sirtuins also utilize NAD + to remove other kinds of post-translational protein modifications, including malonylation and succinylation. In all of these reactions, the ADPR generated from NAD + becomes an acceptor for the post-translational group removed from the target protein. For example, during the deacetylation of histones, SIRT1 transfers the acetyl group from key lysine residues of the histone protein to ADPR. Sirtuin activity is increased with caloric restriction and has been associated with increased long evity and/or health in yeast, worms, flies and mice [14] [15] [16] [17] ; however, these links have been questioned, as other studies have reported that lifespan extension in yeast, worms and flies may be sirtuin-independent 18 .",

The half-life of NAD + is 1-2 h in the cytoplasm and nucleus and approximately 8 h in mitochondria 22, 23 . Despite this short half-life, the intracellular concentration of NAD + is thought to remain fairly constant in healthy states, varying only a few-fold with changes in metabolic activity 24 . Elegant studies using a NAD + biosensor showed that NAD + concentration varies substantially between different intracellular compartments 23 . The cytoplasm and nucleus of HEK293T cells had free NAD + concentrations of approximately 100 \u03bcM, which was approximately half that of mitochondria. These three pools of NAD + may be connected, although a mammalian intracellular NAD + transporter has not yet been identified 23 . If NAD + concentrations are regulated in a compartment-specific manner, this regulation could have an impact on the redox function to generate ATP as well as the substrate function for NAD + -consuming enzymes. For example, a reduction in the level of PARP1, which is predominantly localized in the nucleus, markedly increased the nuclear:cytoplasmic ratio of NAD + , without altering mitochondrial NAD + levels or the activity of mitochondrial SIRT3 (reF. 25 ).",

            "text": "Redox cycling, biosynthesis and consumption of NAD + are all closely linked to the cellular balance of NADP + (Fig. 1 ). As mentioned above, NADP + can be generated directly by phosphorylation of NAD + via NAD + kinases, whereas transfer of a hydride from NADH to NADP + via Nam-nucleotide transhydrogenase generates NADPH. Conversion of NAD + to NADP + is estimated to consume approximately 10% of cellular NAD + (reF. 8 ). NADP + can also be generated from Nam via NAD(P) nucleosidase, which catalyses the reaction between Nam and ADPR phosphate. NADPH is generated from NADP + by the pentose phosphate pathway, which operates in parallel with glycolysis in the cytosol and is responsible for approximately 10-20% of glucose utilization. NADPH has an important role in antioxidant defence and serves several reductive and signalling functions in the cell. Fatty acid synthases utilize NADPH as a cofactor to synthesize fatty acids from acetyl-CoA; NADPH oxidases generate oxygen free radicals from NADPH that are used by neutrophils for the oxidative burst during antimicrobial defence; and glutathione reductase uses NADPH to catalyse the reduction of glutathione disulfide to glutathione 26 . Another major function of the pentose phosphate pathway is to generate metabolic building blocks, such as ribose-5-phosphate and erythrose-4-phosphate, Fig. 1 | Overview of NAD + metabolism In highly metabolically active mammalian cells such as the renal tubular epithelium, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD + ) acts as a hub that coordinates various aspects of metabolism. Addition of a hydride ion (H -) (an electron pair) to NAD + yields its reduced form, NADH. Reduction of NAD + to NADH is required for glycolysis, fatty acid oxidation and the tricarboxylic acid cycle (also known as the citric acid cycle and Krebs cycle). Oxidation of NADH (donation of the electron pair) moves high-energy electrons from fuel substrates to Complex I of the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC). Sequential oxidation-reduction reactions in the ETC generate a proton motive force that is utilized by mitochondrial ATP synthase to generate ATP (not shown). Oxidation of NADH is also required to generate lactic acid from pyruvate and for the desaturation of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). NAD + can also be phosphorylated to form NADP + . Oxidation-reduction reactions involving NADP + and its reduced form, NADPH, facilitate defence against oxidative stress by serving as a cofactor for thioredoxin-dependent reduction of disulfides and as a cofactor for glutathione reductase, which reduces the disulfide form of glutathione to its antioxidant sulfhydryl form. Reduction of NADP + also occurs in the pentose phosphate pathway , which generates chemical building blocks for sugars and nucleic acids. NADPH serves as a substrate for NADPH oxidase enzymes (NOXs) that create second messengers of free radicals. NAD + can also be cleaved by poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARPs), sirtuins and the cyclic ADP-ribose (ADPR) synthetases CD38 and CD157 to generate nicotinamide (Nam) and ADPR.",

Indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) is a rate-limiting enzyme that catalyses the first step in this pathway , the conversion of tryptophan to N-formylkynurenine (not shown). Quinolinate phosphoribosyltransferase (QPRT) catalyses the conversion of quinolinic acid to nicotinate mononucleotide (NAMN). This bottleneck step commits the pathway to NAD + synthesis. The Preiss-Handler pathway converts the acid form of vitamin B 3 , nicotinic acid (also known as niacin), to NAMN. This conversion is catalysed by nicotinate phosphoribosyltransferase (NAPRT). NAMN is converted to NAD + by the sequential action of nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyl transferases (NMNATs) and NAD synthetase (NADSYN). The salvage pathway converts the base analogue of vitamin B 3 , nicotinamide (Nam; also known as niacinamide), to NAD + via the rate-limiting enzyme Nam phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT). Nam mononucleotide (NMN) is a measurable intermediate in this pathway that can also be obtained through supplements and synthesized from the dietary precursor nicotinamide riboside. The salvage pathway is so named because NAD + is 'reclaimed' from the Nam product of enzymes that consume NAD + to generate ADP-ribose (ADPR) or cyclic ADPR (cADPR). NAD + is converted to NAD + phosphate (NADP + ) by NAD + kinases (NADKs). Hydride transfer from NADH to NADP + by nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenase (NNT) also generates NADPH.

Accumulation of quinolinic acid in the postischaemic urine suggested a reduction in the levels of the enzyme that utilizes this substrate, QPRT. As predicted by the metabolomics findings and reported in a previous study 47 , the renal expression of QPRT was reduced in post-ischaemic kidneys. Compared with wild-type litter mates, mice that were heterozygous for QPRT recapitulated nearly half of the AKI urinary metabolomic pattern, even in the absence of AKI. QPRT heterozygous mice were more susceptible to renal IRI than wild-type littermate controls; however, this increased suscepti bility was abrogated by augmenting NAD + biosynthesis via the salvage pathway using exogenous Nam. These results suggest that AKI-induced suppression of QPRT might be a pathogenic event in AKI that can be addressed by orthogonal replenishment of NAD + .

This finding suggests that substrates of fuel oxidation in the epithelial compartment enable the vasculature to regu late blood flow in order to maintain adequate oxygen delivery. Lipidomic analysis showed that Fig. 4 | The de novo NAD + biosynthesis pathway. The de novo nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD + ) biosynthesis pathway (also known as the kynurenine pathway or tryptophan-kynurenine pathway) consists of eight steps that convert dietary tryptophan to NAD + . Tryptophan has multiple metabolic fates that compete with its conversion to N-formylkynurenine, which is catalysed by indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) or Trp 2,3-dioxygenase (TDO) 110 . N-formylkynurenine is hydrolysed to kynurenine by arylformamidase (AFMID). Kynurenine is hydroxylated to 3-hydroxykynurenine by kynurenine 3-monooxygenase (KMO). 3-Hydroxy-kynurenine is a major branch point in the pathway as this metabolite can be converted to xanthurenate or other molecules. Kynureninase (KYNU) catalyses the formation of 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid, which is converted to \u03b1-amino-\u03b2-carboxymuconate-\u03b5-semialdehyde (ACMS) by 3-hydroxyanthranilate 3,4-dioxygenase (HAAO). ACMS can either spontaneously cyclize to form quinolinic acid or can be decarboxylated by ACMS decarboxylase (ACMSD) to form picolinic acid. The only known fate of quinolinic acid is conversion to nicotinate mononucleotide (NAMN) by quinolinate phosphoribosyltransferase (QPRT). Quinolinic acid is therefore the first metabolite in the pathway that is committed to NAD + biosynthesis. Nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferase (NMNAT) catalyses the final step to create NAD + . www.nature.com/nrneph AKI-induced lipid accumulation is characterized by a striking enrichment of diacylglycerols and triacylglycerols high in polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) content. The >50-100-fold elevations of these PUFArich lipid species are greatly out of proportion compared with total lipid accumulation, suggesting that, in addition to blocking their consumption via FAO, AKI might also increase their synthesis. A subsequent study showed that an increase in lipid desaturation may be an adaptive response to the reduced NAD + :NADH ratio in AKI, providing a mechanism for NAD + recycling when tubular mitochondrial respiration is impaired (Fig. 5) . For example, the addition of a desaturase inhibitor further lowered the NAD + :NADH ratio and worsened AKI in mice treated with a mitochondrial toxin 63 . In our study, administration of Nam not only fortified renal NAD + but also reduced AKI-associated accumulation of fats (including PUFA-rich diacylglycerols and triacylglycerols) and AKI severity in two distinct models: IRI and cisplatin nephrotoxicity 47 . These findings suggest that reduced NAD + levels in various types of renal injury might result in impairment of normal tubular function, but might be amenable to therapeutic augmentation.",

We found that treatment with NMN preserved mitophagy and enhanced lysosomal disposal of injured mitochondria in cisplatin-treated tubular cells and in a mouse model of cisplatin nephrotoxicity 49 . PGC1\u03b1 and NAD + are upstream inducers of transcription factor EB, a master regulator of lysosomal biogenesis 65, 66 . Administration of NAD + precursors (Nam or NMN) may therefore not only enable efficient ATP generation via FAO but also promote mitochondrial quality control by coordinating the safe disposal of injured, pro-oxidative mitochondria in lysosomes. Indeed, earlier work showed that another cytoprotective sirtuin enzyme, SIRT3, utilizes NAD + to prevent mitochondrial fragmentation and protect renal function in the setting of cisplatin exposure 67 . An independent study confirmed a beneficial effect of SIRT3 in a model of septic AKI 68 .",

As NAD + and NADP + participate in several hundred redox reactions and >20 enzymatic reactions involve consumption of NAD + (reF. 70 ), it may be difficult and perhaps overly simplistic to implicate a single downstream effector pathway in AKI.

We showed that the renal expression of PGC1\u03b1 is suppressed in biopsy samples from patients with AKI compared with the levels in nephrectomy controls 47 . Our subsequent pilot study examined the relationship between PGC1\u03b1 expression in renal allografts from deceased donors and delayed graft function (DGF) 71 . In deceased-donor kidney transplants, periods of warm and cold ischaemia prior to implantation are thought to contribute to clinical IRI. Although the majority of deceased-donor grafts produce sufficient renal clearance for the recipient to cease dialysis within the first 48 h post-transplantation, recipients with DGF may require dialysis for several weeks. In this setting, allograft biopsies are often performed postoperatively to rule out acute rejection. In a small cohort of decreased-donor transplant recipients who had DGF without acute rejection, we found that allograft biopsy samples obtained within 30 days post-transplantation exhibited a large spread of PGC1\u03b1 expression in morphologically intact tubules. Biopsy samples that had the lowest PGC1\u03b1 expression were associated with an additional 2 weeks of dialysis compared with those with the highest PGC1\u03b1 expression 71 . Although preliminary, this result suggests a quantitative relationship between mitochondrial metabolism and clinically relevant end points in AKI. Under aerobic conditions, NAD + is regenerated as electrons are transported to the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) to drive oxidative phosphorylation, which produces ATP. During acute kidney injury (AKI), mitochondrial respiration and function are impaired, glycolysis increases to meet cellular energy demands and cytosolic NAD + recycling is required. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), which converts pyruvate to lactate, has a major role in cytosolic NAD + recycling. Desaturation of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) to form highly unsaturated fatty acids (HUFAs) is an additional mechanism of glycolytic NAD + recycling that is mediated by delta-5 and delta-6 fatty acid desaturases (D5D and D6D). D5D and D6D are located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane and have cytosol-facing catalytic domains; they are highly expressed in the kidney and liver. Experimental AKI is associated with >50-100-fold increases in the levels of HUFA-containing triglycerides and cellular lipid accumulation in renal tubular cells.",

A follow-up study found that glomerular expression of KMO was suppressed in mice and humans with diabetes compared with normal Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD + ) is required for distinct reactions in glycolysis, fatty acid oxidation (FAO) and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle that lead to the generation of ATP via the electron transport chain (ETC) in mitochondria. In healthy renal tubular epithelial cells, this ATP is utilized to provide the energy required for key functions, such as solute transport and maintenance of membrane integrity. Efficient FAO also prevents the potentially toxic accumulation of storage fats. NAD + might also exert renoprotective effects via its interactions with sirtuins and PPAR\u03b3 co-activator 1\u03b1 (PGC1\u03b1). Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) activates PGC1\u03b1 via NAD + -dependent deacetylation and PGC1\u03b1 in turn promotes NAD + biosynthesis via the de novo pathway by co-ordinately upregulating the expression of the genes encoding enzymes in this pathway. PGC1\u03b1 promotes mitochondrial quality control and ATP production via interrelated process that include mitochondrial biogenesis and the induction of mitophagy via transcription factor EB (TFEB). SIRT3 also utilizes NAD + to directly promote healthy mitochondrial function and SIRT1 may limit stress signalling through the pro-apoptotic Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway. In addition to its effects on mitochondria, PGC1\u03b1 signalling can induce the production of vascular trophic molecules, such as VEGF. In tubular epithelial cells, a PGC1\u03b1-dependent product of FAO, \u03b2-hydroxybutyrate (\u03b2-OHB), may signal the production of vasodilator prostaglandins that can maintain renal blood flow during conditions such as shock that would otherwise promote renal ischaemia. Phosphorylation of NAD + to NADP + may potentiate defence against oxidant stress induced by inflammation, toxins, or ischaemia-reperfusion injury by promoting the reduction of glutathione (GSH) and through the vasodilator nitric oxide (NO\u2022). Mitochondrial quality control may also limit the burden of free radicals emanating from injured mitochondria.",

As podocytes are affected in many CKD syndromes, these results suggest an involvement of de novo NAD + biosynthesis in CKD.

Echoing findings in experimental AKI 60, 61 , lower expression of these genes was associated with higher lipid accumulation in the tubular epithelium. The researchers also used folic acid to induce tubulointerstitial fibrosis in mice and found that transgenic expression of PGC1\u03b1 in the renal tubular epithelium restored the expression of FAO genes, reduced expression of profibrotic molecules and improved renal histology. A related study from the same group showed that distal tubular deletion of the gene encoding LKB1, an upstream kinase that activates AMPK, was associated with decreased expression of AMPK and PGC1\u03b1 and resulted in progressive kidney disease in mice 82 . LKB1-deficient cells were charac terized by energy depletion, reduced FAO and a pro fibrotic phenotype; treatment with an AMPK agonist ameliorated these effects. Taken together, these results raise the possibility that metabolic dysfunction might be a common characteristic that links AKI and CKD. Whether increasing PGC1\u03b1 expression either directly or via AMPK or Tug1 in CKD models is associated with changes in kidney NAD + levels has not yet been reported. However, the encouraging result with exogenous Nam administration in a mouse model of fibrosis suggests that augmentation of NAD + is a potential therapeutic approach to slowing CKD progression 75 .",

Furthermore, the study size and duration of follow-up were modest, and the rate of drug discontinuation was high (42% in the Nam plus lanthanum group and 25% in the Nam only group). Gastrointestinal symptoms and pill burden were the most common reasons cited for discontinuation.

Given the ubiquity and importance of NAD + metabolism in cellular health, knowledge gained in the kidney may provide novel fundamental and translational insights that could be applicable to other organs. Similar to the kidney tubular epithelium, cardiomyocytes are mitochondria-rich and highly dependent on FAO for ATP generation. Enhancing cardiac NAD + levels by transgenic expression of NAMPT or exogenous administration of NMN seems to prevent the decrease in NAD + and attenuate the cardiac damage that results from IRI 104, 105 . Although neurons do not utilize fatty acids for ATP generation, they are metabolically active and cerebral ischaemia results in NAD + depletion in the central nervous system 106 . In mice, treatment with Nam or NMN normalized brain NAD + levels and ameliorated brain damage following cerebral ischaemia 107 . Low NAD + levels and mitochondrial dysfunction have also been observed in animal models of ataxia telangiectasia; replenishing NAD + via NR administration normalized neuromuscular function and delayed memory loss in these models 108 . In the liver, NAD + augmentation through various pathways has been shown to protect against diet-induced obesity and fatty-liver disease 54, 109 . Thus, NAD + seems to have a key role in maintaining health in multiple metabolically active organs. As different tissues vary in their energy demands, preferred fuels, dependence on de novo NAD + biosynthesis versus NAD + salvage and expression of downstream NAD + -consuming enzymes, a more nuanced understanding of NAD + homeostasis throughout the body is required to harness its full potential for therapeutic modulation (TaBle 1) .",

            "text": "The regulation of NAD + balance within cells involves a complex interplay among biosynthetic pathways and degradative enzymes, compartmentalization and movement between pools of NAD(H) and NADP(H). A body of research dating back nearly 20 years has identified NAD + as a determinant of ageing in experi mental organisms; however, translating knowledge of NAD + biology into medical applications is challenging. As a highly metabolically active organ with a clear age-related phenotype, the kidney has emerged as an intriguing physiological system in which to study the consequences of NAD + biology. In tubular epithelial cells, NAD + facilitates the high demand for electron transport that transforms fatty acid fuel into ATP. Experimental AKI of various aetiologies is characterized by a common, rapid decrease in renal NAD + that is driven in part by impaired biosynthesis from tryptophan. Augmentation of NAD + enhances FAO and broad cell-regulatory signalling networks that protect oxidative metabolism and mitochondrial health. Together, these actions may protect stressed renal tubular cells from death. Human AKI also seems to be characterized by a deficit in de novo NAD + biosynthesis, raising the possibility of therapeutic NAD + augmentation using vitamin B 3 analogues. Future studies are needed to understand the mechanistic links among ageing, CKD and AKI. Study of NAD + in the kidney may also yield insights that are applicable to other metabolically active organs, such as the heart and brain. In addition, translational studies that assess and modulate NAD + metabolism may lead to new avenues for the diagnosis, prognosis, prevention and treatment of diseases of the kidney and other organs.",

Taken together, these results implicate accelerated NAD + consumption owing to induction of PARPs in the development of AKI. Several PARP inhibitors, including olaparib, rucaparib and talazoparib, have been FDA-approved for the treatment of BRCA-related breast and ovarian cancer, making PARP inhibition tractable for clinical evaluation in AKI.Defective de novo NAD + biosynthesis. The kidney possesses the enzymatic machinery to synthesize NAD + by all of the known mammalian pathways. Evidence that de novo NAD + biosynthesis is impaired in AKI emerged from studies aimed at identifying downstream effectors of the renoprotective effects of PGC1\u03b1 1,47 . In cultured renal tubular cells, overexpression of PGC1\u03b1 protected against oxidant stress48 . Our research group found that mice with global or tubule-specific knockout of the gene encoding PGC1\u03b1 exhibited blunted recovery and worse renal injury following endotoxaemia, systemic cisplatin treatment or bilateral renal IRI compared with wild-type controls47,49,50 . Conversely, mice with tubule-specific overexpression of PGC1\u03b1 were protected against all three models of AKI47,49,50 . The PPARGC1A locus, which encodes PGC1\u03b1, contains an evolutionarily conserved upstream open reading frame (uORF) in the 5\u2032 untranslated region51 .
