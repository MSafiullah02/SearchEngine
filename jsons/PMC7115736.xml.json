Infection control measures of the dialysis unit staff followed the recommendation by the WHO,8 with waterproof disposable gown, cap, gloves, face shield, and N95 facemask. A designated Gambro AK100 dialysis machine (Gambro, Lund, Sweden) was used with ordinary tap water supply passing through the Purtrex model PX10-9-7/8 filter (10-\u03bcm polypropylene; Osmonics Inc, Minnetonka, MN) without reverse osmosis or other water treatment. We used Fresenius F7 polysulfone dialyzer (Fresenius Medical Care, Bad Hamburg, Germany) without reuse. Spent dialysate was drained directly to the ward washbasin, which was connected to the main sewage drain by a U-trap. After a session of hemodialysis, the dialyzer and all blood tubings were discarded as infectious waste. Unspent dialysate concentrate and sodium bicarbonate cartridge were also discarded. The dialysis machine was disinfected by sodium hypochlorite solution according to the manufacturer\u2019s instruction. The dialysis machine was kept in a room in the SARS isolation ward between dialysis sessions and was only used for patients who had contracted SARS and required dialysis. Spent hypochlorite solution and rinse water were drained to the same washbasin, which did not receive additional disinfection.",

He gradually improved, and his oxygen requirement was gradually reduced. Towards the end of the recovery phase, his oxygen saturation on room air remained above 96%. Since the patient became asymptomatic, a formal pulmonary function test was not performed to avoid inadvertent spreading of residual coronavirus during the forced expiration of spirometry. Chest radiograph improved slowly and continued to show bilateral basal infiltrate 8 weeks after the initial presentation (Fig 1D). A high-resolution computed tomography of thorax showed diffuse ground glass opacification, bilateral patchy consolidation, and fibrosis, features compatible with recovery phase of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (Fig 3). He was given a total 4-week course of ribavirin and was put on 0.5 mg/kg/day oral prednisolone as maintenance to cover the ongoing pulmonary inflammation.",

In the case series of our hospital, 1 most patients present with fever, rigor, myalgia, dizziness, and diarrhea. The majority had lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, prolonged activated partial-thromboplastin time, elevated D-dimer, CK, LDH, and ALT.1 In general, our patient followed the typical 3-phase course of the illness: viral replicative phase, immune hyperactive phase, and then pulmonary destructive phase.9 In the first phase, symptoms are similar to upper respiratory infection with fever and myalgia. The second phase, due to immune response, causes febrile illness and rapidly increasing pulmonary inflammation with dyspnea. Postinflammatory fibrosis occurs in the third phase. However, our patient had an unexpectedly prolonged course of illness. He required hospitalization for more than 2 months, as compared to the average hospital stay of 14 to 25 days for other SARS patients.1 The pulmonary infiltrate in his chest radiograph resolved only slowly and remained obvious almost 2 months after his initial presentation (see Fig 1D). Furthermore, PCR for SARS-associated coronavirus RNA was positive in his stool sample for almost 2 months. In other patients, the virus usually becomes undetectable in stool by week 5. It is postulated that renal failure patients cannot eliminate the SARS-associated coronavirus effectively because of their relatively depressed immunity. Similar observation has been described in other chronic viral infections of renal failure patients.10\n",

It is generally recommended that the dosage of ribavirin should be halved in patients with a glomerular filtration rate below 10 mL/min, and a supplemental dose should be administered after hemodialysis.12 In fact, some studies found that it was necessary to reduce the dosage in order to maintain its plasma level16 and to avoid significant hemolysis.13, 14 We followed the recommended dosage regimen adjustment in our patient.",
