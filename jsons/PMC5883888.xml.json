            "text": "Avian species are excellent biological models in reproduction and tumorigenesis [1] as well as efficient source of secreting cells for use in bioreactors [2\u20134]. Both hen and quail oviduct cells secrete human therapeutic proteins after genetic modification [3]. Therefore the oviduct epithelium is a useful and fast in vitro model to test for the efficiency of viral [5] and nonviral genetic constructs [6] to study the modified secretome. Both quail and hen produce cellular substrates for the development of vaccines [7]. Genetic markers, including markers of stemness, are useful to identify mechanisms of malignant changes in a fallopian tube, because the somatic stem cells contribute to a population of tumor-initiating cells [8]. Recently, the knowledge about cell differentiation, physiology, and cancerogenic changes in avian oviduct has been extrapolated to women fallopian tube and uterine tract [9, 10]. However, in avian species, markers of stemness in oviduct cells have not been reported yet. There is a knowledge gap regarding distinctive features of the epithelial cells in in vitro conditions vs. their status in tissue, which limits full understanding and characterization of this cellular model. In this paper, we have made initial attempts to confirm progenitor molecular signatures in oviducts of laying hen (Gallus gallus domesticus) and quail (Coturnix japonica), both in tissue and in cultured oviduct epithelial cells (in vitro assay). We have addressed the following questions: What is the location of progenitor cells in avian oviduct tissue? What is an individual molecular characteristic of distal oviduct tissue compartments? Is this distinctive characteristic stable once the cells are plated in in vitro condition? Is the molecular pattern shared between these two model species (laying hen and quail) used for oviduct studies? Altogether, this study aims to provide a new understanding of molecular characteristic of oviduct epithelial cells in avian species.",

Both cell types require sustained renewal from the stem cell compartment and a high proliferation and maturation activity from the progenitor compartment. Those compartments are putatively based under the luminal epithelium as cellular niches [11]. In a mammalian fallopian tube, stem cells niches were tracked using antibodies and genetic markers and were found to be localized in the distal fallopian tube [8, 12]. In our earlier research, we determined faster proliferation of cultivated hen oviduct cells derived from infundibulum/distal magnum compared to the cells that were sourced from a proximal magnum. We have also determined that distal oviduct compartments were positively immunostained against CD44 and p63, which are known to be epithelial stem/progenitor markers [13]. Thereby, we have hypothesized that distal segments of avian oviduct contain progenitor gene expression signatures.",

As reported earlier, the self-renewal activity of cells in the fallopian tube occurs in its distal part [14, 15]. Thereby, in this paper, we have focused on distal parts of the oviduct (the closest to ovaries and abdomen) to follow the molecular characteristics of the cells in tissue and in vitro. We propose a panel of epithelial genetic markers to determine the progenitor/epithelial cell pattern in selected compartments of the oviduct (Fig. 1). In particular, we have aimed to reveal which of the avian oviduct compartments (infundibulum (INF), distal magnum (DM), or proximal magnum (PM)) carry known progenitor signatures.",

Laying Japanese quails (n = 6, 10 weeks old) were obtained from a commercial producer (K. Drazek, Wyzne, Poland). All birds laid eggs at a daily rate and no hormonal stimulation was applied for this study. Immediately upon transportation, the animals were sacrificed by cervical dislocation. Only the oviducts after egg passage, with ovum position in a shell gland, were used for the experiments. Each oviduct was rinsed twice in tube filled out with 25 mL physiological buffered saline (PBS) w/o Mg, w/o Ca (Lonza Biosciences, Celllab, Warszawa, Poland), which was gently mixed with Penicillin-Streptomycin solution at 1:100 (v:v; Life Technologies, Warszawa, Poland).",

Immediately after tissue collection, three oviduct fragments were dissected: infundibulum, distal magnum, and proximal magnum, each 3 cm long. Each fragment was cleaned off the mesentery tissue and minced with a scalpel blade on a Petri dish. The minced fragments were digested in a solution of 1 mg/mL collagenase P (Sigma-Aldrich, Poznan, Poland) in Advanced Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagles Medium-F12 (DMEM/F-12; Life Technologies, Warszawa, Poland) for 30 min at 37 \u00b0C, on a shaker. Due to the size of oviductal tubes, the amount of minced tissue was ~ 50% less in quail than in hen. Thus, adequately lower volumes of digestion solution were applied to process the quail oviduct tissue. The cells were counted manually using Neubauer hemocytometer and seeded at a density of 4 \u00d7 104 cells/cm2 into 25 cm2 vented BD type Primaria flasks (Becton Dickinson, Diag-med, Warszawa, Poland). The cells were incubated in 7% CO2 atmosphere at 37 \u00b0C. The oviduct cells were maintained in DMEM-F12 supplemented with 5% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS; Life Technologies, cat. 16,140-063, batch No. 41G4541K, Warszawa, Poland), 1% (v/v) nonessential amino acids (Sigma-Aldrich, Poznan, Poland), 20 mM L-glutamine (Sigma-Aldrich, Poznan, Poland), 10 ng/mL human epidermal growth factor (human EGF; R&D Bioscience, Biokom, Janki, Poland), 1% (v/v) antibiotic \u2013 antimycotic solution (Life Technologies, Warszawa, Poland), 0.5 \u03bcg/mL hydrocortisone (Sigma Aldrich, Poznan, Poland) and 5 \u03bcg/mL insulin-transferrin-selenium (ITS; Sigma-Aldrich, Poznan, Poland). The viability and the proliferation of oviduct cells were measured by a real-time cell analyzer (RTCA) supplied by xCELLigence system (Roche Applied Science, Basel, Switzerland). The measurements of proliferating cells were conducted at 3.1 h intervals through 287 h post seeding, in accordance with the producer\u2019s manual. The cells intended for sampling were cultivated for 5\u20137 days prior to harvesting and analysis. Every second day, the epithelial colonies were counted and photographed under an objective with phase contrast (Zeiss Axiovert 40) equipped with a digital camera (Canon EOS 600). The cells were harvested upon reaching 80% of growth confluence. Cultured oviduct epithelial cells were referred as chicken oviduct epithelial cells (COEC) or quail oviduct epithelial cells (QOEC) in further parts of this paper.",

The COEC and QOEC isolated from the infundibulum region typically occurred as cellular spheres, which attached to the polystyrene culture vessel after 3 days post seeding and were consequently creating epithelial-like colonies, which spread on the surface of the culture vessel. Once the small epithelial colonies appeared beneath the spheres, they enter a high proliferation phase to rapidly form a confluent monolayer. Typical cultures from the infundibulum region were characterized by numerous compact epithelial islands, oval in shape, surrounded by elongated cells of mesenchymal or fibroblast-like phenotype (Fig. 2a, b). Epithelial cells isolated from the region of distal magnum (a transition region between infundibulum and proximal magnum) formed visible epithelial islands 3 days after seeding, which was sooner compared to the infundibulum region. In the case of distal magnum, spheres that formed epithelial-like colonies in vitro were half the size of those isolated from the infundibulum and about two times less colonies were initiated, compared to those from the infundibulum region on day 3 (Fig. 2c, d). In most cases, the epithelial colonies from the distal magnum proliferated fast and were ready for passage by 6\u20137 days after seeding. The cells from the region of proximal magnum usually did not form spheres in the beginning of the cultivation (Fig. 2e, f). Typically, in proximal magnum, the proliferating epithelial colonies were observed in 3\u20135 days post seeding. The microscopic observations of growing colonies were in line with the measurements acquired from the xCELLigence real-time cell monitoring system. The peak of the proliferation was determined for the cells from all oviduct compartments after 3 days post seeding: at 78.27 h for the INF part, at 79.05 h for the DM part, and at 79.05 h for the PM part. Then, the cell proliferation entered the plateau, which lasted 16.22 h for INF cells, 15.5 h for PM cells, and 10.85 h for DM cells. The cells from PM displayed larger morphology than cells from INF, and the shape of colonies was not compact, but oval and irregular. The confluent monolayer was heteromorphic, consisting of epithelial and fibroblast-like colonies (Fig. 2e, f). Motile cilia, which are characteristic for oviduct ciliated cells, were observed in the cultivated primary colonies, but only until the first passage. A movie file shows this in more detail (Additional file 1).",

Those differences between infundibulum and magnum compartments were significant only in hen earlier, but we have determined a clear numerical pattern also in quail. Such a pattern of the oviduct markers reflects physiological functions of distinct compartments, e.g., oocyte transport and sperm storage in the infundibulum vs. egg white protein production in the magnum. For this reason, ESR1, which encodes the estrogen receptor 1, whose major function is binding estradiol\u2014a major sex hormone of laying birds, was expressed in all parts of the oviduct. On the other hand, OVAL and OVM, which encode major egg white proteins, were expressed only in the magnum.

Infundibulum is lined with ciliated epithelia, which are highly used by the frequent transportation of the oocyte and protein secretion. They require constant renewal from the basal epithelium, which is intensively proliferating. Strong induction of keratin genes is related with this function of the infundibulum.

OCT4/cPOUV and LGR5 were not expressed in the chicken oviduct tissue. In quail, we determined a high-fold induction of LGR5 and OCT4/cPOUV and a moderate abundance of CD44 and SOX9. CD44 is a cell surface glycoprotein and an established progenitor/stem-like cell marker in fallopian tube in mammals. CD44-positive cell population showed the capacity for clonal growth and differentiation into tubal epithelial cells, particularly in the distal region of the tube [15, 27]. We earlier showed a high immunochemical stain of CD44 in the distal oviduct of a hen [6]. SOX9 is a transcription factor in early epithelial lineage [28, 29]. It is involved in the organogenesis of different tissues and its main function is to maintain a population of undifferentiated somatic stem cells. SOX9 was recently announced as a novel cancer stem cell marker [30]. In our study, we consider this gene as a marker for precursor epithelial oviduct cells of avian species. Musashi-1 is expressed in intestinal crypts and human endometrium, where it maintains multipotent potential for epithelial cells emerging from M\u00fcllerian duct (precursor of oviduct in vertebrates) [31]. OCT4/cPOUV and NANOG are chicken stem cell markers [32, 33], while LGR5 is recognized as marker stem cells in tubal epithelia [14]. In our study, LGR5 and OCT4/cPOUV were detected at high level in quail oviduct. Overall, the pattern of expression of progenitor markers supports the designation of distal oviduct compartments as the source of progenitor epithelial cells.",

Secretive potential of magnum-derived cells was retained as reflected by the expression of OVM and OVAL in COEC and ESR1 in QOEC. Primary cultured cells, such as highly specialized oviduct epithelial cells, are prone to rapid differentiation in vitro. This way, they may easily lose their original phenotype, for example, the ability for protein secretion. On the other hand, INF-derived COEC gained secretive potential after being cultured in vitro, which was reflected by changing the downregulation of OVM and OVAL to upregulation of those genes as compared to donor tissues. Stimulation with estrogen was reported as necessary to maintain responsiveness of hen oviduct cells to this sex hormone [34]. However, in this experiment, neither the birds were stimulated with the estrogen prior to tissue harvesting, nor the cultivated cells were treated with estrogen, which might explain the lack of ESR-1 mRNA in the cultivated COEC. Epithelial character of both COEC and QOEC was maintained, especially in KRT14 (COEC) and other epithelial markers (QOEC) mRNA abundance.",

LGR5 was significantly upregulated in cultivated cells, and has been proven to mark the stem cells in murine oviduct/fimbria [14]. Precursor character of certain populations of cultured cells allowed for their proliferation and differentiation in vitro. INF-derived COEC gained gene expression signatures of oviduct secretive cells (OVM and OVAL). Population of progenitor cells is required for the establishment of a primary cell culture [35]. In our study, we have confirmed progenitor gene expression signatures in proliferating cultures. Based on the morphological assessment, a subpopulation of the cultured cells displayed epithelial character of ciliated and secreting cells. But there was also a large subpopulation of differentiated mesenchymal and fibroblast-like forms in both COEC and QOEC, after passaging. With these observations, a stable oviduct epithelial cell line could be probably established from both in vitro models, with the prior purification of progenitor cells from the heterogeneous starting cell populations.",

Analysis of the oviduct tissue and cultured cells allowed for characterizing the molecular makeup of those cells in tissue, in relation to the source of the oviduct compartment (infundibulum, distal magnum, and proximal magnum). Further analysis from in vitro-cultivated cells showed molecular pattern that was different from noncultivated oviduct cells. In conclusion, the analysis of tissue material revealed a gradual increase/decrease pattern in majority of the markers in both species. This pattern changed after those cells had been cultured in vitro. A progenitor marker, OCT4/cPOUV was strongly downregulated in both in vitro models, whereas the expression of SOX9 and the epithelial marker KRT14 were not changed compared to the calibrator (FC ~ 1). Cultivated hen cells (COEC) gained the expression of LGR5 progenitor marker, which could indicate a shift toward a more specific epithelial progenitor cell type. These results can contribute to further research on creating new biological models from reproductive tissue and the characterization required to develop new avian cell lines.",
