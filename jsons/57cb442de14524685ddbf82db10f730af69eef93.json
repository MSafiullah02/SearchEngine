It is defined as the presence of microorganisms in the pulmonary parenchyma leading to the development of an inflammatory response by the host, which may be localized in the lung or may extend systemically. Nosocomial pneumonia is an infectious process which develops within 48 hours after admission to the hospital and that was not incubating at the time of hospitalization. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is considered as a subgroup of nosocomial pneumonia and is an infectious pulmonary process which develops 48 hours after the presence of an artificial airway and mechanical ventilation. Since a large proportion of the patients who develop nosocomial pneumonia are intubated and receive mechanical ventilation, most epidemiological and clinical studies on nosocomial pneumonia have been focused on critically ill patients and those receiving mechanical ventilation. From a clinical point of view, nosocomial pneumonia is of great importance not only because of the consequences of the important morbidity and mortality but also due to the high costs associated with development of this disease.",

This may be due to the lack of a standardized diagnostic approach and the different populations studied. Moreover, although YAP has been well defined, disagreement as to the final diagnosis may be attributed to: 1) focal areas of the lobe which may be missed; 2) negative microbiological studies despite the presence of inflammation in the lung; and 3) pathologists may disagree in their conclusions.",

Early colonization (within the first 24 hours of mechanical ventilation) has been described in patients who are intubated and in those receiving mechanical ventilation, varying from 80 % to 89 % [13) . One study [14) demonstrated that 45 % of 213 patients admitted to a medical leu became colonized with aerobic Gram-negative bacilli by the end of one week in the hospital. Among the 95 colonized patients, 23 % developed nosocomial pneumonia while only four out of the 118 non-colonized patients developed pneumonia. Among the microorganisms colonizing the trachea, Pseudomonas spp. has an increased affinity to ciliated tracheal epithelial cells and these microorganisms are not usually present in the oropharynx. Adherence of Pseudomonas increases in desquamated epithelium following influenza virus infection, tracheostomy, or repeated tracheal suctions in intubated patients [15) . In a study including 86 patients receiving mechanical ventilation, oropharyngeal colonization, which was detected either on admission or from subsequent samples, was a predominant factor of nosocomial pneumonia compared with gastric colonization [16) . Oropharyngeal colonization with Acinetobactor baumanii yielded an estimated 7.45-fold increased risk of pneumonia compared with patients who had not yet or who were not identically colonized (p = 0.0004).

Likewise, previous antibiotic administration may influence the development of YAP in two different ways: Its use may be associated with a protective effect against early-onset pneumonia, while, on the other hand, it may be associated with an increased risk of lateonset pneumonia. To determine the baseline and time -dependent risk factors for YAP, Cook et al. [8] evaluated 1014 patients. On multivariate analysis, independent predictors of YAP were a primary diagnosis on admission of burns (risk ratio 5.09), trauma (risk ratio 5.00), central nervous system disease (risk ratio 3.40), respiratory disease, cardiac disease (risk ratio 2.72), mechanical ventilation within the previous 24 hours (risk ratio 2.28), witnessed aspiration (risk ratio 3.25) and paralytic agents. Exposure to antibiotics conferred protection (risk ratio 0.37), but this effect attenuated over time. Rello et al. [17] evaluated the risk factors for YAP within the first 8 days of mechanical ventilation in 83 consecutive intubated patients undergoing continuous aspiration of subglottic secretions. Multivariate analysis showed the protective effect of antibiotic use (relative risk 0.10) whereas failure of continuous aspiration of subglottic secretions (relative risk 5.29) was associated with a greater risk of pneumonia. In addition, Sirvent et al. [18] evaluated the use of systemic prophylaxis with cefuroxime before intubation on the incidence of YAP in 100 patients with coma, 50 of whom received one dose of 1.5 g of cefuroxime intravenously at the time of intubation and a second dose 12 h later. The global incidence of early-onset YAP was 37 % (n = 37): 12 (24 %) in the cefuroxime group and 25 (50 %) in the control group (p = 0.007). All these studies demonstrate the protective effect of antibiotic therapy in early YAP caused by endogenous flora. In a prospective study in 277 patients receiving mechanical ventilation, Kollef [10] determined that the following four factors were associated with YAP: Index of systemic organ failure~3 (odds ratio [OR]=10.2), age~60 years (OR = 5.1), previous antibiotics (OR = 3.1), and supine head position within the first 24 hours of mechanical ventilation (OR = 2.9). In addition to the importance of antibiotic therapy as a risk factor for YAP, the influence of antibiotics on the etiology of this disease is also relevant. In a prospective study, Rello et al. [19] studied 129 consecutive episodes ofVAP to evaluate the influence of prior antibiotic administration on the etiology and mortality of YAP. The rate of YAP caused by Gram-positive cocci or Haemophilus injluenzae was statistically lower (p < 0.05) in patients who had received antibiotics previously while the rate of YAP caused by P. aeruginosa was statistically higher (p< 0.01).",

All of these studies have demonstrated that antimicrobial therapy has a bimodal effect on the development of YAP. Antibiotics protect against early-onset pneumonia, especially pneumonia caused by endogenous flora, but they are also responsible for the selection of resistant microorganisms causing late-onset pneumonia such as P. aeruginosa and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA).",

The relationship between gastric pH and gastric colonization has been well established in several studies. The use of prophylactic agents for stress ulcers, which alter the gastric pH, may increase gastric colonization and the rates of VAP, although this remains to be demonstrated. In a 1991 metaanalysis , Tryba [24] found that antacids and Hy-antagonists were significantly more effective in preventing stress bleeding in treated versus untreated patients. Sucralfate was superior to Hz-antagonists. Patients treated with antacids or Hy-antagonists showed a significantly higher risk for the development of nosocomial pneumonia. In a later study, Cook et al. [25] demonstrated a trend toward less clinically important bleeding with Hj-antagonists and antacids than with sucralfate. They found a trend toward an increased risk of pneumonia associated with Hy-antagonists compared with no prophylaxis and a sign ificantly higher risk compared to sucralfate. Finally, another meta-analysis [26] concluded that ranitidine is not effective in the prevention of gastrointestinal bleeding and may increase the risk of pneumonia. Studies on sucralfate do not provide conclusive results. Currently, there are not enough data to give a conclusive recommendation.",

Despite the use of histology in pulmonary biopsy and cultures of pulmonary tissue in the immediate post-mortem period, the value of these techniques in parenchymal infections has not been unequivocally demonstrated. Suspicion of nosocomial pneumonia depends on the finding of new and persistent infiltrates on chest X-ray in association with some clinical signs and symptoms (fever or hypothermia, purulent respiratory secretions and leukocytosis or leukopenia). Based on histology and microbiological cultures of post-mortem pulmonary biopsies, one study demonstrated that the presence of radiological findings plus two or more clinical criteria showed a sensitivity and specificity of 69 % and 75 %, respectively [27] .",

At present, the value of non-invasive tests, such as tracheobronchial aspirate, and invasive bronchoscopic tests, such as bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and the protected specimen brush (PSB), as well as the advantages and disadvantages of each technique have been well established [30] . As a general rule, tracheobronchial aspirate has very good sensitivity with a specificity a little lower than the invasive tests when using a quantitative culture of the respiratory secretions obtained by this method [31] . In different studies, the sensitivity of this test varies from 38-100 % with a specificity of 14-100 % [32] . A negative tracheobronchial aspirate culture in a patient who has not received antibiotic treatment has a high negative predictive value for the presence of YAP. In one study on the diagnostic value of this technique, the negative predictive value was 72 % in 102 patients evaluated with this technique and with invasive methods. The sensitivity of PSB and BAL are 33 -100 % and 42 -93 %, respectively and the specificities are 50-100 % and 45-100 % [7] . On the other hand, the current controversy lays in the role invasive and non-invasive methods have in the prognosis and use of antibiotics in these patients. On analyzing only the randomized studies, we found that in a pilot study with 51 patients Sanchez-Nieto and coworkers [33] observed that bronchoscopic methods led to a greater change in initial antibiotic treatment (42 % versus 16 %, P < 0.05) with no significant differences as regards to either global or attributable mortality or morbidity. This study was limited by its small sample size and the lack of a standard treatment protocol in the invasive group. The study by Sole-Vio-Ian and coworkers [34] demonstrated a greater number of antibiotic changes with invasive techniques with no clear influence on mortality, length of ICU stay, and days on mechanical ventilation. Ruiz and coworkers [35] compared 765 patients with suspicion of YAP (39 non-invasive and 37 invasive) and concluded that the diagnostic performance of both techniques in YAP was similar, as was mortality at 3D days, number of days on mechanical ventilation, and length of leu stay. The costs of invasive studies were clearly greater. One study by Fagon and coworkers [36] reported positive results with respect to a decrease in mortality on day 14 Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores on days 3 and 7, a reduction in the use of antibiotics, and the number of antibiotic -free days with the invasive technique. Nonetheless, the study was limited by the use of qualitative cultures of the tracheal aspirates which thereby limited comparison with the other studies.",

Nonetheless, the mortality in this group was comparable to the mortality reported among patients who continued to receive inadequate therapy (n = 23). In a study by Rello and coworkers [42) , bronchoscopic results led to a change in antibiotic treatment in 27 cases (24 %) considered to have received inadequate initial treatment. Despite clinical resolution in 17 of these cases (63 %), the mortality was higher compared to patients with initial adequate therapy. Kollef and Ward [41) found a high prevalence (73 %) of inadequate initial antibiotic therapy in a study of 130 patients with YAP. In this study, the mortality of patients in whom the antibiotic therapy had been started or changed based on the results of mini-BAL culture was significantly higher compared to patients with unchanged or discontinued treatment (60.8 % vs. 33.3 % and 14.3%, respectively).",

However, taking the in vitro sensitivity of the pathogens isolated into account, the adequacy of the antibiotic treatment proposed by these classifications was found to be rather lower (79 % for ATS and 80 % for Trouillet). The microorganisms involved in treatment inadequacy were multiresistant P. aeruginosa, A. baumanii, S. maltoph ilia, and MRSA.

In the ATS guidelines [45] , the experts recommend that the length of treatment be shortened from the traditional 14-21 days to shorter periods, to 7-10 days. The latter shorter treatment is recommended in the treatment of S. aureus and H. influenzae pneumonia. However, in specific situations such as multilobar involvement, malnutrition, cavitation, Gram-negative necrotizing pneumonia, and/or isolation of P. aeruginosa or Acinetobacter spp., 14-21-day therapy should be initiated. Nonetheless, recent evidence has suggested that short treatment is as effective as longer treatment in YAP. Chastre and coworkers [48] evaluated 401 patients with YAP, 197 were randomized to receive short (8-day) treatment and 204 a long (IS-day) course of antibiotic treatment. No differences were observed in the mortality rate (I8 .8 % vs.17.2 %) or in the recurrence of pulmonary infection (28.9 % vs. 26 %) on comparing the two groups of pat ients. However, those treated with a short course of antibiotics had significantly more antibiotic-free days (I3 \u00b1 7.4 vs. 8.7 \u00b1 5.2 days, p < 0.00l). The possibility of providing adequate treatment with shorter courses of antibiotics will not only reduce health care costs but will also have favorable consequences on microbial ecology by reducing the selection pressure for resistance.",
