Again Anatolia was blessed with abundant iron ore in its mountains. Consequently the Ancient Near East had the earliest Iron Age from 1300 to 600 BCE followed by India 1200-200 BCE and Europe 1200-400 BCE , China 600-200 BCE , Korea 400-50 BCE and Japan 100 BCE -500 CE . 2 Other historians give earlier dates for the Iron Age in Anatolia saying the earliest iron ware dates from about 2000 BCE 3 and forged weapons at the latest by 1500 BCE . 4 According to the late eminent Oxford historian John Morris Roberts when discussing the Hittite Empire, he stated it \"enjoyed a virtual monopoly of iron in Asia, this not only had great agricultural importance but, together with their mastery of fortifi cation and the chariot, gave the Hittites a military superiority which was the scourge of Egypt and Mesopotamia\". 5 Also \"the use of iron weapons by the Hittites was believed to have been a major factor in the rapid rise of the Hittite Empire\". 6 By 1200 BCE , iron was in common use around the Middle East but it would take a few more centuries before it supplanted bronze as the dominant metal even though it was lighter and stronger. One theory for the collapse of the Bronze Age was a lack of tin either due to it having been mined out or because its trade routes had been disrupted due to raiders, 7 thus forcing metalworkers to look for an alternative metal. Hence iron became the next preferred metal. Another explanation for the end of the Bronze Age is simply that iron, once discovered, was found to be a better metal because it was much stronger.",

The end of the Bronze Age was known as the \"catastrophe\" 10 because it signaled the end of all the known empires in the Eastern Mediterranean and Near East including the Hittite Empire, the Mycenaean Kingdoms and the Egyptian Empire in Syria and Canaan, but not the central Nile based Egyptian Empire. It was followed by the \"Ancient Dark Age\" when all that was glorious about these lost empires including, not only their palaces and cities but also their history, religions, writings, art, music, administration and organization, temples, libraries, political systems and trade routes were lost. This loss lasted many centuries until the emergence of the classical Greek, Assyrian and Persian Empires and the Hebrews later. The catastrophe lasted from c.1200-c.1150 BCE and was characterized by its short time frame of about 50 years, mass migrations of populations and mass destruction where whole cities were destroyed and burnt, but also curiously many whole cities were just abandoned intact. It was also characterized by another mass population migration involving raiders called the \"Sea Peoples\" who invaded the Near East from the Mediterranean region. It was \"violent, sudden and culturally disruptive\". 11 The Dartmouth University Archaeology Department has an online lesson about the collapse of the Mycenaean Palatial Civilization in Greece around 1200 BCE . It summarizes the causes of this collapse as: economic factors, climate change, internal social upheaval, invasion from outside the Aegean World and changes in the nature of warfare. 12 Historian Robert Drews in his book The End of the Bronze Age has on his list of possible causes of the collapse the following: earthquakes, mass migrations, ironworking, drought, systems collapse, raiders and changes in warfare. 13 The internet website, www.enotes.com , lists the possible causes for the Bronze Age Collapse, which includes the following: volcanoes, earthquakes, migrations, raids, ironworking, drought, changes in warfare and general systems collapse. 14 Note that there is no mention of disease as a possible cause of the End of the Bronze Age in any of these three lists. By contrast this book proposes the more comprehensive list of sixteen causes for the end of the Bronze Age, including diseases.",

According to volcanologists and Egyptologists, it erupted in 1159 BCE throwing an estimated \"7.3 cubic km of volcanic rock into the atmosphere, placing its Volcanic Explosivity Index (VEI) at 5. This would have blocked out the sun leading to cooler temperatures in the northern parts of the globe for a few years afterwards. Thus plants would not grow causing famine and eventual disease in the weakened population. Traces of this eruption have been identifi ed in Scottish peat bogs, and in Ireland a study of tree rings dating from this period has shown negligible tree ring growth for a decade\". 15 The Volcanic Explosivity Index is a relative measure of the explosiveness of a volcanic eruption on a scale of 1-8, with 8 being a mega-colossal eruption where the cloud column of ejected material would climb to a height of over 50 km. Such a large volcanic eruption could have caused famine in the Near East contributing to the demise of the region. The scale is logarithmic where each interval on the scale represents a ten-fold increase in the material ejected. By comparison the largest volcanic eruption in recent history was Mt. Krakatoa in 1883 which had a Volcanic Explosivity Index of 6, and Mt. Vesuvius which destroyed Pompeii in 79 had a Volcanic Exposivity Index of 5.",

He has built a year by year chronology of tree ring growth reaching back \"the last 5,000 years\". 16 His work has confi rmed \"that the events such as those at 1628 BC, 1159 BC and AD 540, represented abrupt environmental downturns with profound effects on human populations\". 17 These dates correspond with dynastic changes in China, the end of the Bronze Age in the Near East and the Plague of Justinian, respectively. These events were most likely volcanic in cause but he also argues that it could also be due to the impact of debris from comets blocking out the sun and causing temperatures to fall for years, hence poor growth in trees, as shown in their tree rings, and all other plants leading to famine which makes the general population more prone to disease. This has been formalized in his paper \"Hints that Cometary Debris Played some Role in Several Tree Ring Dated Environmental Downturns in the Bronze Age\". 18 Earthquakes Amos Nur is the Emeritus Professor of Geophysics at Stanford University, California, USA and he: postulates that earthquakes tend to occur in \"sequences\" or \"storms\" where a major earthquake above 6.5 on the Richter magnitude scale can in later months or years set off second or subsequent earthquakes along the weakened fault line. He shows that when a map of earthquake occurrence is superimposed on a map of the sites destroyed in the late Bronze Age, there is a very close correspondence. 19 In his paper \"The End of the Bronze Age by Large Earthquakes?\" 20 Nur proposes that a large earthquake storm lasting 50 years from c.1225 to c.1175 BCE could have contributed to the End of the Bronze Age.",

This probably began by an earthquake storm that unzipped the plate boundaries in the eastern Mediterranean between 1225 and 1175 BCE . The earthquakes in this 50-year long storm could have rendered many of the urban centers militarily vulnerable, thus inviting attacks, not by powerful distant Sea People but by opportunistic indigenous or neighboring populations. These attacks may have led in turn to the political and social collapse of the centres, followed by a dark age of recovery and rebuilding often lasting a few hundred years. 21 Figure 8 of Nur's paper shows \"Superposition of the sites destroyed at the end of the Bronze Age in 1200 BC and the earthquake intensity VII in our century . The coincidence suggests that the end of the end of the Bronze Age could be related to earthquakes\". 22 (See the table of Bronze Age Earthquake Destruction in Nur's paper.) 23 Drews in his book End of the Bronze Age dismisses the idea of earthquakes totally. He says that archaeologists only look at their own site and an earthquake may be relevant only to this site and not the whole of the Eastern Mediterranean.

There are two schools of thought as to their origin. One school says they were Mycenaean because they made distinctive Mycenaean IIIC pottery, whereas the other school says they were an indigenous Canaanite culture. Either way they became a force that helped attack Egypt as part of the \"Sea Peoples\". 2. Minoan hypothesis : After the eruption of the volcano at Thera (today's Santorini), sometime between 1660-1613 BCE , Crete would have been devastated by fi res and ash causing a cooling climate resulting in crop failures and famine, plus the tsunamis destroying the coastline. The people of the Minoan culture would have been forced to leave Crete, some scholars say initially to Anatolia and from there later to the Levant as \"Sea Peoples\". 3. Greek migration hypothesis : Greece not only possibly supplied people for the Philistines but also supplied people who migrated to Sicily and Sardinia as well as fought in Troy and later occupied Cyprus. So they would have been bands of raiders/invaders like the Sea Peoples. 4. Trojan hypothesis : Historian Eberhard Zangger proposes that the \"Sea Peoples\" may have come from Troy and its allies, and that the Greek literary tradition of the Trojan War, as told by the poet Homer, may well refl ect the Greek efforts to counter those raids. 30 Zangger (1958) is a Swiss German who has a PhD in natural sciences from Stanford University and was a senior research associate in the Department of Earth Sciences at the University of Cambridge from 1988-1991.

Anatolian famine hypothesis : In this hypothesis extensive drought in Anatolia, which led to famine, in turn forced people from places in Anatolia such as Lydia to go to sea and become sea-going migrants. These displaced people could later become Sea Peoples. A famous passage from Herodotus portrays the wandering and migration of Lydians from Anatolia because of famine: In the days of Atys, the son of Manes, there was a great scarcity through the whole land of Lydia \u2026 So the King determined to divide the nation in half \u2026 the one to stay, the other to leave the land ... The emigrants should have his son Tyrrhenus for their leader ... They went down to Smyrna, and built themselves ships \u2026 After sailing past many countries they came to Umbria ... and called themselves \u2026 Tyrrhenians. 31 8. Invader hypothesis : Historian Michael Grant proposed that there may have been another origin for the \"Sea Peoples\" besides the Aegean. He proposed that \"There was a gigantic series of migratory waves, extending all the way from the Danube valley to the plains of China.\" 32 Grant (1914 Grant ( -2004 ) received a Doctor of Literature from the University of Cambridge and was an English classicist, numismatist and author of more than seventy books on ancient history and ancient coins.",

In addition there is a continuous decrease in indices in the last fi ve years of the empire. Examining the tree rings shows the existence of dry years which contributed to drought on the lands\". 36 Peter Ian Kuniholm founded the Aegean Dendrochronology Project in 1973 and has been its Director ever since. This project examines tree rings all over the Aegean and Near East to make up a chronology of the area from Neolithic time to the present. He has shown that in 1190 BCE trees grew at only 53.5% of their normal rate, in 1189 BCE at 61.1% and in 1188 BCE at 62% indicating three consecutive years of drought, which would lead to famine. Examination of the data presented in this paper shows that the occurrence of three such poor growth years in a row was rare. 37 Kuniholm is the Professor of Archaeology and Dendrochronology at Cornell University. He gained his BA at Brown University in 1958, his MA at Vanderbilt University in 1963 and his PhD from the University of Pennsylvania in 1977.",

As discussed above, there was correspondence between the Hittite King and the Egyptian Pharaoh about urgent grain shipments for Hattusa.

They did not dominate in the Aegean as the topography was different being more rugged terrain with fewer large fl at areas suited to chariot warfare. These chariots were manned by a socially and economically privileged warrior elite (e.g. the Hittite Empire, the Mycenaean Kingdoms, city states of coastal Syria and the Levant (such as Ugarit), the Hurrian Kingdom of Mitanni, the Kassite Kingdom of Babylon etc). 41 Drews argues that these large massed chariot formations involving sometimes thousands of chariots became vulnerable when they were harassed and killed by highly mobile, lightly armed infantry who used new and better weapons with great success. These new weapons included (a) the Aspis-a highly maneuverable small round shield 2-3 feet in diameter as opposed to the Sakos or large immobile shield; (b) the Javelin which had elliptical heads instead of a barb which allowed easy retraction hence reuse. Massed javelins thrown on the run using massed swarming formations were very effective against massed chariots; (c) The new Nave Type II sword which was about 70 cm long which \"optimized both for slashing as well as stabbing or thrusting\" 42 and fi nally (d) \"The infantryman's corslet, which protected the trunk, arose, along with greaves for protecting below the knees\". 43 This new warfare meant that an entire elite social order of charioteers became redundant and were replaced by infantry and cavalry. This meant signifi cant disruptions of the aristocracy and consequently the royal families.",

Murder, even of the incumbent king as a means to gaining control of the throne, was accepted practice. Fighting between different branches of the royal families leading to civil war would have badly destabilized any empire. Oliver Dickinson from Durham University had a similar view when he stated in chapter 36 \"The Collapse at the end of the Bronze Age\" in his contribution to The Oxford Handbook of The Bronze Age Aegean (c3000-1000 BC) that \"it is a waste of effort to try to isolate a single cause or prime mover for the Collapse.\" 50 This is because it was most probably the result of several causes. This is what this book is arguing that the end of the Bronze Age in the Near East, referred to as either \"The Catastrophe\" or \"The Collapse\" [ Dickinson preferred the term Collapse], was the result of a cascade of events beginning with volcanic eruptions and comets. These caused drought which in turn caused famine, which weakened the population so they (rich and poor alike, because disease does not discriminate) were prone to whatever infectious disease happened to be prevalent at the time. This is in agreement with Dickinson's \"Natural disasters like earthquakes, localized droughts leading to famines, or epidemic diseases could have acted as catalysts for trouble or have exacerbated an already deteriorating situation\". 51 Dickinson also showed that many sites were abandoned at the end of the Bronze Age not reoccupied for many centuries. This would be expected when an infectious disease epidemic is active. His abandoned city list included places such as Gla, Messenia and Krisa in the Aegean, besides the well documented abandonment of Hattusa, the Hittite capital in Anatolia.",

Note that most diseases listed are infectious diseases. He also gave a possible reason why disease has not been considered as a cause for the end of the Bronze Age because \"many such scholars are completely unaware of the social effects of disease and the major consequences that ensued whenever contacts across disease boundaries allowed a new infection to invade a population that lacked any acquired immunity.\" 57 Arnott referred to the research of J. Lawrence Angel (also known as the archaeological \"bone man\") and Robert Sallares who have found the lethal falciparum malaria DNA in ancient skeletons, making malaria a strong infectious disease that possibly contributed to the end of the Bronze Age. He also supported the drought leading onto disease hypothesis stating \"If widespread climatic change and drought were mainly responsible for the decline and collapse of the Mycenaean world in the twelfth century BC, as has been suggested \u2026 then a natural consequence would have been widespread epidemic disease (e.g. cholera and typhoid) brought on by the shortage of clean drinking water\". 58 In conclusion, Arnott paints a very bleak picture of life for the ordinary man in ancient times \"the harsh reality of a society where life was hard, death and disease were everyday occurrences and the day-to-day ambition of those who lived outside the palaces was simply survival\". 59 Eric Watson-Williams wrote an article about the end of the Bronze Age called \"The End of an Epoch\" in which he championed bubonic plague as the sole cause for the catastrophe. \"What seems so puzzling is the reason why these apparently strong and prosperous kingdoms should disintegrate\" 60 he questioned. He cites abandonment of cities, the adoption of the practice of cremation of the dead instead of the usual burial because so many people died, and it was necessary to destroy the decomposing bodies quickly, and the fact that bubonic plague is very deadly killing animals and birds as well as humans, affects large areas, spreads rapidly and lingers for many years as reasons for his choice of bubonic plague. Unlike Panagiotakopulu, he provides no physical evidence, but uses history to compare how things were during later bubonic plague epidemics such as the Plague of Justinian and the Black Death to how things were around 1200 BCE .",

Mark Achtman's research was published in Nature Genetics in an article titled \" Yersinia pestis genome sequencing identifi es patterns of global phylogenetic diversity\". 66 His team compared seventeen whole genomes of Yersinia pestis isolates from various global sources and \"conducted phylogenetic analyses on this sequence variation dataset, assigned isolates to populations based on maximum parsimony and, from these results, made inferences regarding historical transmission routes. The phylogenetic analysis suggests that Yersinia pestis evolved in or near China and spread through multiple radiations to Europe, South America, Africa and Southeast Asia, leading to country-specifi c lineages\". 67 Mark Achtman BSc, MSc, PhD from the University of California, Berkeley, USA is a Canadian microbiology researcher at the University College, Cork, Ireland where he specializes in the population genetics of bacterial pathogens and microbial phylogeography. Prior to this he was a researcher at the Max-Planck Institute in Berlin, Germany specializing in molecular genetics and infections biology.",

With the support of Josephus, I submit, therefore that the plague of the Philistines was one of the forms of bacillary dysentery, either Shiga or a virulent Flexner dysentery, and that the \"emerods\" were \"piles.\" 84 Note his point that \"it is not wise to ignore it\".

Typhus fever and typhoid fever can be dismissed, because neither disease is accompanied by the development of swellings around the anus; but bacillary dysentery is frequently associated, because of the invariable concomitant tenesmus, with the formation of external piles, those rounded protuberances from the anal margins that are at fi rst hot, red and painful, but which later often itch considerably as they resolve. It is commonly stated in medical textbooks that bacillary dysentery in hot climates is more prone to give rise to piles than is the disease in temperate ones. The usual explanation given is that the anal sphincter is generally more lax in individuals living in hot lands than in those living in temperate regions. 85 But Shrewsbury gives another reason for his conclusion that the Plague of the Philistines was in fact dysentery and not bubonic plague.",

If the \"emerods\" were plague buboes, the action of the Gethrites was utterly nonsensical; but if, as I have argued, they were hemorrhoids, then anyone who has suffered from external piles will agree that the Gethrites showed good sense. The difference in comfort to the sufferer from piles between reclining upon a skin seat and sitting cross-legged upon the ground must be experienced to be appreciated, but I can assure the reader that it is profound. 86 The signifi cance of the plague cannot be underestimated.

That restoration deprived the Philistines of the inestimable moral advantage that the possession of the Ark gave to them, and at the same time restored to the Israelites the focus upon which all their national activities and aspirations converged. I therefore affi rm that this act, because it saved the Israelite society from almost certain extinction, must be ranked as one of the decisive acts in human history, and I draw support for that affi rmation from the authoritative pronouncement of Osterley and Robinson (1932) : \"Yet small and insignifi cant among the nations of the world as Israel was, without political infl uence or extended power, it may safely be said that no other people of antiquity holds a place of such profound importance in the history of human thought. It was Israel who gave to the world a religion which has directed the spiritual life of nearly half mankind, and, not only among the Jews themselves, but in the two daughter faiths of Christianity and Islam, has molded the beliefs of men in every continent save central and eastern Asia\". 87 William Oscar Emil Osterley and T.H. Robinson were historians who wrote the book A History of Israel published by Oxford University Press in 1932. The other aspect of this plague is the fact that it occurred in Palestine, which Shrewsbury referred to as the \"cock pit\" 88 ) of the ancient world. According to Osterley and Robinson \"Palestine was the commercial, military and political center of the ancient world, and on it focused all the greatest movements of the peoples\" 89 because any conqueror had to control it if they wanted free movement from Europe or Asia into Africa or in the reverse. So controlling Palestine was vital because of this movement factor between Europe, Asia and Africa, the same factor that would also have easily spread the plague via the fl eeing masses into adjoining regions thus spreading it throughout the Near East during the end of the Bronze Age.",

This fact is the signature of emergency situations such as those existing during a plague. Artefacts in the tombs revealed that they and, thus the epidemic, could be dated to c.1715 BCE . 92 During the epidemic of 1715 BCE the Hebrew population in Avaris fared a lot better than the local Egyptians because the Egyptians living in the city had no immunity to tularemia while the Hebrews, who were exposed to sheep and other animals, had a natural immunity to tularemia and survived.

A disease lasting 35-40 years, infecting humans and animals, causing fever, disabilities, and death, spreading via rodents aboard ships as well as donkeys, points to Francisella tularensis , the etiological agent of tularemia. This disease can linger for a long time, and its longevity is incompatible with shorter-lived epidemics such as from bubonic plague, which for instance hit Europe around 1347-1349, and in 1629-1634. Furthermore, the description in Neshite records, e.g. knees, debilitation, and sensation of internal burning, is also coherent with tularemia. Moreover, tularemia also fi ts the onset of the infection, as it infects caravans stopping for rest, turning them into carriers for the etiological agent. The aforementioned trading route between the Mediterranean Sea and the Euphrates would have had such contact points allowing for the spread of the pathogen. 94 Trevisonato further believes that the Plague of the Philistines was also due to tularemia, which has Canaan, the setting for the Plague of the Philistines, as a natural reservoir as shown above.

Because the end of the Bronze Age is approximately 3,200 years ago, then the virgin population factor has to be taken into consideration as some of the epidemics, such as infl uenza and measles, may have been the fi rst appearance of these infections in history, hence they would be a lot more lethal than they are today in the same area, the Near East.",

There is no good evidence or records to support the existence of infl uenza and measles. They may well have occurred and been lethal, but if they did occur they would have been seasonal and relatively shortlived epidemics. This is in agreement with Itamar Singer's understanding who said \"plagues are already attested in Anatolia in the Old Assyrian Colony period (Cecen 1995), and are often mentioned in Late Bronze Age Syrian documents (Klengel 1999b)\". 105 So it is possible that diseases could have contributed to the end of the Hittite Empire and the end of the Bronze Age in a major way. Because of the timeframe of about 50 years from c.1200-1150 BCE there was plenty of time to have several major lethal epidemics such as bubonic plague, smallpox and tularemia occur on a widespread scale, supported by more local epidemics such as dysentery, poliomyelitis, tuberculosis, measles, infl uenza, anthrax and malaria. In a time of poor hygiene, no antibiotics and no vaccines these infections (fi ve of which are so virulent that they are still used as germ warfare agents today, namely bubonic plague, smallpox, tuberculosis, anthrax and dysentery) had the potential to devastate the Near East and should be factored in as potential cofactors in the future by historians. Any future discussions about the end of the Hittite Empire and end of the Bronze Age should be considered as incomplete if disease is not considered and included.",

In 1905 he published his book A Treatise on Plague through Cambridge University Press. The description of the plague also mentions tumors that could have been buboes or the swollen lymph nodes associated with bubonic plague. Watson-Williams 79 and Walloe 80 also support the theory that bubonic plague caused the Hittite Epidemic of 1322 BCE , the Plague of the Philistines c.1190 BCE and the end of the Bronze Age c.1200 BCE . From its bases in Egypt and Canaan the bubonic plague could have spread across the entire Near East and Eastern Mediterranean region destroying empires and ending the Bronze Age.
