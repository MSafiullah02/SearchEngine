While they assert that regional anesthesia is not an aerosol-generating procedure,1 there is recent preliminary evidence that COVID-19 may spread via small (< 5 \u00b5m) respiratory droplets, which can remain in the air for prolonged periods of time. These droplets are generated not only through coughing and sneezing, but also through forceful exhalation and loud speech.2 Regional block placement, especially if challenging, may therefore result in an unnecessary potential exposure. Thus, for those patients having a planned general anesthetic where a concomitant regional technique is also going to be used, we should consider re-evaluating the current recommendations of the American Society of Regional Anesthesia that currently advises against the routine performance of peripheral nerve blocks in anesthetized adult patients.3 Proponents of this practice believe that patient wakefulness may aid in the detection of local anesthetic systemic toxicity (LAST) or impending peripheral nerve injury.3,4",
