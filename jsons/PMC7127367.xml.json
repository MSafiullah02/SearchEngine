This genus includes several enveloped, negative-sense single-stranded RNA viruses infecting humans (measles virus), terrestrial and aquatic animals (e. g. canine distemper virus, CDV) with severe and fatal systemic diseases (de Vries et al., 2015). Morbilliviruses have a linear single stranded negative RNA genome of nearly 16 kb encoding six structural proteins. One of these is the haemagglutinin protein (H) coded by the H gene. H protein is a major determinant for virus-host interaction and viral entry via attachment to signalling lymphocyte activation molecule (SLAM) (Tatsuo et al., 2001). The H protein binds the receptor resulting in cellular attachment and activation of the F protein by tissue-specific proteases leading to cellular infection.",

In most cats, CKD is also a progressive disease and can be accompanied by a wide range of clinical and pathological changes, but the underlying aetiology of CKD is often undiagnosed. CKD could result, indeed, from a variety of potential factors that may include toxic insults, hypoxia, chronic glomerulonephritis, chronic pyelonephritis, upper urinary tract obstructions, viral infections, that lead to a final common pathway of irreversible, progressive kidney damage (Elliott and Barber, 1998). Idiopathic CKD such as pyelonephritis, glomerulonephritis and TIN due to unknown causes has been reported extensively (Elliott and Barber, 1998; Mayer-Roenne et al., 2007; Chakrabarti et al., 2013).",

The new viral species so far denominated feline morbillivirus (FeMV) was first identified in Hong Kong in 2009 (Woo et al., 2012) and associated with tubulo-interstitial nephritis (TIN). Following the first report in Hong Kong, FeMV was identified and isolated in cell culture in Japan (Furuya et al., 2014; Sagaguchi et al., 2014; Park et al., 2016; Sutummaporn et al., 2019). Since then, several surveys have been conducted worldwide in order to unravel the epidemiology of this virus and the association with TIN. The virus was described in Germany, USA, South America, Turkey, UK and Malaysia (Sieg et al., 2015; Sharp et al., 2016; Darold et al., 2017; Yilmaz et al., 2017; McCallum et al., 2018; Mohd et al., 2019). In Italy, FeMV was described for the \ufb01rst time by our group in 2015 in the municipality of Teramo, Abruzzi region, Central Italy. A 15-years old domestic stray cat diagnosed with severe nephropathy was hospitalized and found positive for FeMV RNA in the urine (Lorusso et al., 2015). FeMV RNA was evidenced by quantitative real time PCR from the \ufb01rst day of observation up to cat\u2019s death which occurred 110 days later (De Luca et al., 2018). FeMV was also recently identified in Northern Italy (Stranieri et al., 2019). So far, a clear association between virus and TIN has been not yet demonstrated (Furuya et al., 2014; Sakaguchi et al., 2014; Park et al., 2016; Darold et al., 2017; Yilmaz et al., 2017; Stranieri et al., 2019).",

Cats included in the study were divided into two groups: group A and group B. Specifically, group A was composed by 143 and 53 individuals admitted to the VUHs of Teramo and Bologna, respectively; group B was composed by 35 carcasses admitted at IZSAM for necropsy. In detail, urine (n = 196), whole blood (n = 196) and serum samples (n = 196) were collected from 196 live cats of group A; from carcasses of group B tissue samples (n = 385) including brain, cerebellum, heart, lung, intestine, stomach, liver, kidney, urinary bladder, spleen and mesenteric lymph nodes were collected during necropsy. Cats of group A were further classified in random household cats, originating from the two Italian regions under investigation and admitted with different clinical histories at the VUHs (subgroup RC, n = 127), and cats from three independent colonies (subgroup C, n = 69, which includes C1, n = 52; C2, n = 14 and C3, n = 3). Colonies C1, C2 and C3 were in Tortoreto, Martinsicuro and Mosciano Sant\u2019Angelo, respectively, in the province of Teramo, Abruzzi region (Fig. 1\n). As far as we know, cats from colonies were not vaccinated against the major feline infectious diseases. Urine samples from all cats were collected by cystocentesis. Cats from colonies were hospitalized in groups of 5 at the VUH of Teramo. Cats of group A that tested positive for FeMV underwent haemato-biochemical analysis, urinalysis, urinary protein/creatinine ratio and symmetrical dimethylarginine (data not included). Carcasses of group B were also classified in random carcasses of household cats (originating from different areas of Abruzzi region, subgroup RCC, n = 28), and in carcasses from colonies (n = 7). This latter subgroup, CC, was formed by 5/7 carcasses from C1 and 2/7 from C2, and named CC1 and CC2, respectively. Groups classification has been listed, for clarity, in Table1\n.",

Within FeMV positive cats of subgroup RC, 2/11 were from the VUH of Bologna, 9/11 from the VUH of Teramo. Threshold cycle (CT) values are reported in Table S1. The higher prevalence in subgroup C, compared to subgroup RC, was statistically significant (chi square test = 17.2, p < 0.001). FeMV RNA was not detected in blood samples. Within carcasses of group B, the 71.4% (5/7; IC 95% 35\u201391) of carcasses of subgroup CC (carcasses from colonies) tested positive for FeMV RNA in at least one tissue sample, the 10.71% (3/28; IC 95% 4\u201327) of subgroup RCC (random carcasses). Out of 8 positive carcasses, kidneys from 7 carcasses, urinary bladders (n = 4), spleen (n = 3), brain (n = 1), and mesenteric lymph nodes (1/1) tested positive by qPCRFeMV (for further details Table S2) titres generally low. One cat of subgroup RCC showed low FeMV RNA titres in the brain.

The prevalence of FeMV RNA positive urine samples was significantly higher (p < 0.001) in cats from colonies, compared to household cats. Reasonably, this difference is likely due to the higher probability of successful transmission occurring in cats of colonies. In this regard, young and middle aged cats of colonies are also the ones which mainly compose pattern 1 and 2, RNA+/Ab + and RNA+/Ab-, respectively, when virological and serological results were combined and analyzed together.

All samples were indeed tested by this molecular assay developed prior to the discovery of FeMV GT2. Second, we did not perform NGS with nucleic acids purified from all qPCRFeMV negative samples, thus divergent viruses, including feline paramyxovirus (FPaV, Sieg et al., 2015) or potentially novel FeMV genotypes may have been missed. Third, a complete virological follow up of cats from colonies was not performed for several reasons, including adoptions, spontaneous leaving and deaths by accidents with cars. A follow up was possible only from the 5 cats of colonies which succumbed 8\u201310 months later after the evidence of FeMV RNA intra vitam.

Although in a recent study we described the isolation of two FeMV strains (Donato et al., 2019) showing clear viral syncytia at the first cell passage, CPE characteristic of all morbilliviruses, in this occasion it was possible to observe CPE (cell rounding, detachment and lysis) in FEA cells only from 1/33 FeMV RNA positive urine sample after two blind passages of ten days each. Syncytia were visible only at the 4th passage but then CPE was not observed in the following passages. This apparent inefficiency in virus isolation may depend either from the biological characteristics of the virus possibly combined with the absence of a proper viable cell line, or from the timing of sample collection or from inappropriate sample storage. In general, in Morbillivirus diagnostics, viral isolation is still considered the \u201cgold standard\u201d, even though efficient in vitro isolation and propagation of live virus is difficult to achieve. Hence, the chance that FeMV was an uncultivable virus, characteristics of many other viruses affecting domestic carnivores (Lorusso et al., 2008; Decaro and Buonavoglia, 2008; Decaro et al., 2014; Zaccaria et al., 2016), was unlikely, even more in light of the successful isolation of FeMV performed by our study group and other worldwide. In this regard, isolation and propagation in cells of a FeMV close relative, CDV have been for decades difficult to be achieved (Appel et al., 1992; Metzler et al., 1984; Seki et al., 2003; Shin et al., 1997). However less than twenty years ago, a Vero cell line stably expressing the canine signalling lymphocyte activation molecule (SLAM; CD150) was established and since then the efficiency of isolation and propagation of wild type CDVs strains greatly improved (Seki et al., 2003). However, we were not able to observe CPE or to rescue live FeMV from Vero cells expressing canine SLAM (data not shown), unlikely other morbilliviruses such as dolphin morbillivirus which was successfully isolated on these cells (Peletto et al., 2018). Thus, it would be beneficial to establish a homologous cell system stably expressing the feline SLAM and attempt isolation and propagation of FeMV RNA positive biological samples, including tissues (eg kidneys). Timing of sample collection may be also responsible for failure of virus isolation taking into account for the apparent chronic nature of FeMV infection evidenced by the long-lasting RNA shedding (De Luca et al., 2018; Sharp et al., 2016) and importantly by the low viral titres which are constantly detected by the used molecular assay. Low viral titres may account, per se, for failure of virus isolation. As evidenced for other viruses such as canine parvovirus type 2, virus isolation may give positive results only for few days post infection despite the high DNA viral titres present in the feaces of infected dogs likely due to antibodies in the intestinal lumen (and so the faeces) which may bind virions and prevent viral attachment to cell receptors (Desario et al., 2005; Decaro and Buonavoglia, 2017). All blood samples tested negative for FeMV RNA including those of the 12 cats of pattern 2 (RNA+/Ab-) supposedly to be individuals in the early phase of infection as suggested by the absence of FeMV antibodies yet with very low viral titres in the urine. One could reasonably argue that successful isolation was achieved, by our group, at the first cell passage from two fresh urine samples which also showed low RNA titres (Donato et al., 2019). Truth to be told, we do not have any explanations for this phenomenon. It is known that cell-to-cell spread of morbilliviruses in tissue culture was related to the capability of the virus to induce membrane fusion. H protein determines the extent and efficiency of cell- cell fusion, resulting in decisive influence on the CPE. We can only hypothesize the existence of FeMV strains with different in vitro properties and that each FeMV strain has different efficacy in fusion to host cells presenting a possible rationale why marked CPE is induced by some FeMV strains but not others as already speculated for different strains of CDV (von Messling et al., 2001; Lan et al., 2005). In this regard, the two FeMV strains which were isolated (genotype 1, clade 1a; Donato et al., 2019) are almost identical within each other and more distantly related to FeMV Sheryl/2018 Italy (87% of nt identity). Proper sample storage may also play a role for successful isolation, with particular emphasis for morbilliviruses. As for this, we attempted isolation from fresh urine samples diluted 1:8 in MEM or after refrigeration at 4 \u00b0C for a few days. This temperature was demonstrated to keep FeMV stable for at least twelve days (Koide et al., 2015).",

            "text": "Although performed with a limited number of carcasses, no statistically significant correlation was found between FeMV infection and renal lesions, including TIN. TIN was evidenced also in FeMV-negative cats. This finding, in line with recent reports from other study groups (Furuya et al., 2014; Sakaguchi et al., 2014; Park et al., 2016; Darold et al., 2017; Yilmaz et al., 2017; Stranieri et al., 2019; Mohd et al., 2019), apparently seems to undervalue the importance of FeMV in feline medicine. FeMV RNA was also revealed in the urinary bladder of FeMV-positive carcasses as also evidenced by IHC in Fig. 6d. This suggests that FeMV may have also tropism for receptors (e.g. nectin4) present in transitional epithelium of the bladder, scenario already described for CDV (Pratakpiriya et al., 2017). FeMV RNA could not be detected in the blood samples collected in this study, indicating that the viraemia might not be persistently observed in the infected cats or the viraemia duration was short. However, as suggested by the VHC, FeMV exhibits tropism for inflammatory cells residing in blood vessels of kidney and brain, airway epithelial cells, alveolar macrophages and, with a lesser extent, the central nervous system. In this regard, FeMV-GT2 was also demonstrated to replicate in primary feline epithelial cells from different organs and was also able to infect primary feline T and B cells, monocytes and brain tissues (Sieg et al., 2019). This aspect combined with the evidence of one cat showing low FeMV RNA titres in the brain tissue, may suggest a role of FeMV in pathological processes in other organs or districts during the acute phase of infection or in individuals with compromised immune system triggered by other pathogens whose presence was evidenced in carcasses analyzed of this study. Considering that only few organs collected from carcasses tested positive for FeMV RNA, generally kidneys, a likely evidence of chronic infection, in vivo experimental infection of the natural host or of a susceptible animal model is warranted in order to examine the pathogenesis of FeMV, viral tropism and immune response during the early stages of infection. The analysis of pathogenesis and viral kinetics may be also beneficial for the development of a targeted sampling in field conditions. Moreover, in order to disentangle the role of FeMV in co-infection processes, we strongly believe that FeMV specific molecular tests are needed to be included in the diagnostic workflow of cats in clinical practice.",
