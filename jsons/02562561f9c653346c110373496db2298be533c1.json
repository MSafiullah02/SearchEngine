Here, we raise the importance of stringent diagnosis and data collection regarding neurological complications of COVID-19; we urge caution in the over-diagnosis of neurological disease where it does not exist, but equally strongly encourage the concerted surveillance for such conditions. Additional to the direct neurological complications of COVID-19 infection, neurological patients are at risk of harm from both structural limitations (such as number of intensive care beds), and a hesitancy to treat with certain necessary medications given risk of nosocomial COVID-19 infection. We therefore also outline the specific management of patients with neuroinflammatory diseases in the context of the pandemic. This article describes the implications of COVID-19 on neurological disease and advertises the Neurocritical Care Society's international data collection collaborative that seeks to align data elements.",

Recent correspondence provides a secondary (Chinese language) citation of CSF positivity for SARS-CoV-2 [9] , but no clinical or laboratory details were provided, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques are at risk of sample contamination from shed airborne virus. A concerted effort by the international Human Cell Atlas community (yet to be published, but presented online at https ://www.youtu be.com/watch ?v=gHqBo U4s63 U&featu re=youtu .be) has documented the relative expression of the two key co-receptors for SARS-CoV-2 entry, ACE2, and TMPRSS2, across multiple tissues, and highlights that (in health) there is minimal expression in brain tissue, suggesting that direct brain infection would not be a common phenomenon. The one brain cell type which did express both genes was the oligodendrocyte, and therefore, SARS-CoV-2 encephalitis might be expected to be a predominantly white-matter disease where it does occur.",

It is reassuring that, despite the peak onset of para-infectious conditions typically occurring within 4 weeks, there has been no clear signal from countries affected early in the pandemic course.

            "text": "Further considerations relate to patients with neurological conditions requiring treatments that could worsen outcome from COVID-19, such as immunosuppressant medication for autoimmune neurological diseases. Although recent reports suggest some benefit in the most severe cases of COVID-19-related ARDS [10] , evidence from previous coronavirus outbreaks suggests that viral shedding may be prolonged in patients treated with corticosteroids [11] , and their routine use is currently avoided. Typical second-line treatments for neuroinflammatory crises, intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIg) or plasma exchange (PLEX), are less likely to delay viral clearance in COVID-19, and given some reports of benefit in sepsis [12, 13] , they may even be of potential benefit. However, IVIg is associated with an increased risk of thromboembolism [14] , a particular issue given the reports of increased D-dimer levels [10] and (as yet unquantified) concerns regarding the risk of microthrombosis in COVID-19 infections. Third-line therapies for neuroinflammatory conditions such as cyclophosphamide or rituximab are likely to represent the highest risk treatments with regard to subsequent COVID-19 infection, but are already only used when less toxic medications have failed. We would advocate that those not currently infected with SARS-CoV-2 should receive any treatment required to treat their neurological condition, but in a positive-pressure room where possible (in order to provide against acquiring nosocomial COVID-19 infection). For those who develop contemporaneous COVID-19 infection, we would suggest temporizing with second-line treatments (IVIg/ PLEX) until the active infection has cleared, and ensuring meticulous monitoring and prophylaxis for thromboembolism if IVIg is used.",
