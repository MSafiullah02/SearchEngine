Despite advances in asthma management, acute exacerbations continue to occur and impose considerable morbidity on patients and constitute a major burden on health care resources. Respiratory tract viruses have emerged as the most frequent triggers for exacerbations in both children and adults; however, the mechanisms underlying these remain poorly understood. More recently, it has become increasingly clear that interactions might exist between viruses and other triggers, increasing the likelihood of an exacerbation. In this article we begin with an overview of the health, economic, and social burden that exacerbations of asthma carry with them. This is followed by a review of the pathogenesis of asthma exacerbations, highlighting the various triggers responsible and multiple interactions that exist between them. The final section first addresses what preventative measures are currently available for asthma exacerbations and subsequently examines which of the new treatments in development might lessen the burden of exacerbations in the future.

Interestingly, a number of studies suggest that members of the RV-C group might be intrinsically more virulent, have a greater propensity to cause asthma exacerbations, or both than other rhinoviruses 27, 28 ; however, further work is needed to better define whether a unique clinical picture is associated with RV-C infections.",

After the 2009 H1N1 influenza A pandemic, a number of studies highlighted asthma as an important comorbid condition in those infected with this virus. Markers of illness severity, such as hospitalization, admission to the intensive care unit, and mortality in 2009 patients with H1N1 influenza have been shown to be associated with a diagnosis of asthma. [29] [30] [31] RSV is the main pathogen causing severe bronchiolitis in infants, with most infections occurring between December and February each year. Differentiating among acute wheeze, bronchiolitis, postbronchiolitis wheeze, and acute exacerbations of asthma is frequently difficult in infants and young children. Subsequently, the interpretation of pediatric studies is complex, and the prevalence of RSV can vary widely from study to study. In an Australian birth cohort study RSV accounted for 16.8% (second behind rhinovirus) of cases of wheezy respiratory tract infections in the first year of life, 32 whereas a detection frequency of 27% was seen in a similar British study. 33 RSV in older children and adults is much less frequent; however, it is seen in older adults, in whom it is frequently an underrecognized trigger in acute asthma. A study by Falsey et al 34 demonstrated that 7.2% of hospitalizations for asthma in those older than 65 years were associated with RSV infection. 34 In addition to rhinoviruses, influenza, and RSV, other respiratory tract viruses, such as coronaviruses, human metapneumoviruses, parainfluenza viruses, adenoviruses, and bocaviruses, have all been detected in subjects with asthma exacerbations. However, in a recent epidemiologic study performed after the discovery of several new respiratory tract viruses, such as bocavirus, the only virus type significantly associated with asthma exacerbations in children aged 2 to 17 years were rhinoviruses. 35 ",

For example, a study in infants carried out in September found no cases of influenza at all, 36 whereas a proportion of 20% was seen in another study during the flu season. 37 RSV, metapneumoviruses, and influenza viruses (with the exception of the 2009 H1N1 influenza virus) are usually limited to the winter and early spring. Rhinovirus infections can occur throughout the year but are most common in the spring and autumn. In children seasonal peaks in asthma exacerbations occur frequently in autumn, corresponding to the weeks after the start of the school term. 36, 38 This phenomenon has been termed the September epidemic (Fig 1) . 39 Among older adolescents and young adults, a similar, albeit more blunted, picture is seen, with a peak occurring a week after the school-aged children. In older adults a peak is seen in December to January. The September epidemic was investigated in a case-control study by a Canadian group by limiting recruitment of children with asthma exacerbations to September. Viruses were detected in 62% of cases, with picornaviruses detected in 52% of cases and 29% of control subjects. 36 In view of the fact that other environmental exposures, including allergens and pollutants, also vary by season, it seems probable that a combination of factors results in the seasonal peaks seen in exacerbations.",

Only one of these classes, termed multiple early sensitization, which comprised approximately a quarter of the atopic children, was significantly associated with risk of hospitalization with asthma (Fig 2) . 43 As we begin to better define asthma and allergy phenotypes, appreciating the heterogeneity in these disorders, we will better understand the degree of interaction that exists between them.",

            "text": "More than 40 years ago, Berkovitch et al 44 found evidence of infection with Mycoplasma pneumoniae in 18% of children with asthma exacerbations. Since then, numerous studies have investigated a possible association between bacteria (in particular the atypical organisms M pneumoniae and Chlamydophila pneumoniae) and asthma exacerbations. However, because many of the methods for detecting these organisms are not standardized, are insensitive, or are nonspecific, the results across these studies have been inconsistent. Johnston and Martin 45 reviewed 12 such studies and found that 9 of 12 demonstrated an association between infection with either M pneumoniae or C pneumoniae and exacerbations. These included a study by Allegra et al 46 reporting evidence of atypical bacterial infection with C pneumoniae in 10% of subjects, as well as a prospective study by Lieberman et al 47 demonstrating M pneumoniae infection in 18% of hospitalized asthmatic patients compared with 3% in a matched control group. More recently, Cosentini et al 48 reported acute infection with C pneumoniae, M pneumoniae, or both in 38% of 58 patients presenting to the hospital with an asthma exacerbation, and in the TELICAST study 60% were serologically positive. 49 Freymuth et al 50 reported more modest infection rates of 4.5% and 2.2% for C pneumoniae and M pneumoniae, respectively, in a study using PCR on a collection of 132 nasal aspirates from 75 children hospitalized with acute asthma. Another study of 82 children with acute asthma showed similar rates of 5% for both C pneumoniae and M pneumoniae. 51 No significant differences between asthmatic patients and control subjects have been reported in several other studies with rates of infection of less than 5%, highlighting the inconsistent nature of the association between atypical bacteria and asthma exacerbations. 33, 40, 52 Wark et al 53 found that more than one third of adults presenting with acute severe asthma showed an increase in C pneumoniaespecific antibodies, which is consistent with acute infection, reinfection, or reactivation of latent infection with C pneumoniae. These subjects exhibited a more intense inflammatory response during the acute exacerbations. Because 76% of these exacerbations were associated with viral infection, these data suggest that C pneumoniae might act as a cofactor increasing the severity of virus-induced exacerbations.",

Children in particular spend more time outdoors and exercise more, and therefore they breathe a greater amount of pollution per kilogram of body weight than adults. However, even in the indoor environment there are many sources of NO 2 , including fireplaces, heaters, and gas stoves. In children with asthma, NO 2 exposure is associated with increased respiratory symptoms, [60] [61] [62] and increased personal levels of NO 2 are associated with increased severity of virus-induced exacerbations. 63 This highlights a potential synergistic effect of these 2 inflammatory stimuli. In addition, controlled exposure studies in asthmatic patients have demonstrated that NO 2 can enhance the allergic response to inhaled allergens. 64, 65 Although it is difficult to dissect out all the factors that might play a role in the September epidemic, it is possible that seasonal changes in domiciliary air pollution during this period increase the risk of virus-induced exacerbations.",

Early studies demonstrated a reduction in mild exacerbations when performed in patients with severe asthma. 115, 116 In the year after bronchial thermoplasty, mild asthma exacerbations were significantly reduced at 3 and 12 months (0.18 vs 0.35 in the untreated group), which the authors extrapolated to 10 fewer mild exacerbations per year, but no difference was observed in severe exacerbations. 117 A significant reduction in severe exacerbations was demonstrated in 288 adults with severe asthma randomized to thermoplasty or a sham procedure; however, this was at the expense of 6% more postprocedure hospitalizations in the treatment group. Reduced emergency department visits and work/school absence was also observed in the thermoplasty group up to 1 year after the procedure, and reduction in severe exacerbations has recently been demonstrated to persist until 3 years. 118 Despite these positive results, thermoplasty is unlikely to be widely used because it is very time consuming to administer.",

Gielen et al 119 showed that pretreatment of BECs with azithromycin significantly increased RV-1B-and RV-16-induced type I and III interferons and interferonstimulated gene mRNA and protein expression. In addition, azithromycin reduced rhinovirus replication and release. 120 However, Strunk et al 121 did not demonstrate any superiority of azithromycin over placebo in a study of children in which the primary outcome was time from randomization to inadequate asthma control.",

            "text": "One nonpharmacologic approach rightly emphasized in recent years is the role of patient education combined with selfmanagement. It has been convincingly demonstrated that asthma morbidity can be reduced by a self-management program including self-monitoring, a written action plan, regular medical review, and asthma education. 123 In adults the risk of being admitted to the hospital decreased by more than 40%, and presentations to the emergency department with asthma decreased by more than 20% 123 ; a similar pattern is also seen for children. 124 Effective written action plans can be based on symptoms or peak expiratory flow (PEF) and use 2, 3, or 4 action points. PEF-based plans should use personal-best PEF rather than percent predicted PEF because the former consistently improved health outcomes, whereas the latter appears not to do so. In addition, the instructions regarding treatment of exacerbations should include both ICSs and oral corticosteroids. 125 The ability to predict an exacerbation could have a significant effect on asthma management. Meltzer et al 126 recently found a significant correlation between the measurements of the Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ), a validated composite measure of asthma control, and the risk of future asthma exacerbations. Although it is unrealistic to expect adherence to a full daily diary record, as was required in this study, shorter versions of the ACQ, such as the ACQ-5 or ACQ-6, could be potentially assessed by the patient outside the clinic setting to assess the risk for an asthma exacerbation.",

            "text": "In addition to the mAbs described above, there are a number of other novel targets currently in development with the potential to prevent or reduce the frequency, severity, or both of asthma exacerbations. One such target is inhaled IFN-b. Interest in this target first arose after work by Corne et al, 127 who demonstrated more severe and more prolonged virus-induced asthma symptoms in asthmatic compared with nonasthmatic subjects. Wark et al 128 subsequently provided evidence that BECs from asthmatic patients produced lower levels of the type I IFN-b and also showed higher levels of rhinovirus replication. The BECs from asthmatic patients responded to exogenous treatment with IFN-b, exhibiting reduced rhinovirus release and demonstrating that the deficiency in asthmatic cells was associated with production of antiviral IFN-b rather than the actions of IFN-b. 128 These results suggest that delivery of IFN-b to the lower airways when a cold develops might result in the restoration of antiviral defenses in the lungs of asthmatic patients, limiting the resulting inflammation and thus either preventing or reducing the severity of exacerbations. Importantly, by boosting host defense rather than targeting specific respiratory tract viruses, IFN-b is anticipated to have a broad antiviral activity. The results of a phase 2 proofof-concept trial of IFN-b therapy are awaited with interest. Similar deficiencies of the antiviral type III IFN-ls have been observed in asthmatic patients, 129 and these interferons have also recently been reported to profoundly suppress allergic airway inflammation. 130 Thus this family of interferons is also a potential treatment of great interest. 131 Other BEC-derived cytokines, such as IL-25, IL-33, and thymic stromal lymphopoietin, are looking like increasingly interesting targets in asthmatic patients, and the next 10 years will likely see a surge in studies of these important mediators. Currently, an mAb directed against thymic stromal lymphopoietin (AMG 157) is in phase 1 development 132 and antibodies blocking IL-25 and IL-33 activity have been tested with some success in animal models of asthma 133 and influenza-induced airway hyperreactivity. 134 Other interesting targets currently being investigated are Tolllike receptor (TLR) agonists. TLR7 is a receptor for viral singlestranded RNA and signals through the adaptor molecule MyD88, activating transcription factors that induce production of a range of antiviral and inflammatory cytokines, such as interferons and TNF-a. 135 Kaufman et al 136 recently tested the effects of the synthetic TLR7 agonist imiquimod in guinea pigs in vivo, demonstrating the inhibition of bronchoconstriction within minutes of administration. This novel mechanism to limit bronchoconstriction during respiratory tract infections, in addition to their antiviral properties established some years ago, 137 makes compounds such as these attractive candidates in asthma treatment. In addition to these exciting targets, there are many other approaches currently in development, such as kinase inhibitors and phosphodiesterase inhibitors 138 ; however, a full review of these is beyond the scope of this article.",

Respiratory viruses are now well accepted as the main trigger for these exacerbations, and despite the emergence of newly discovered viruses, rhinoviruses remain the most common pathogens detected. Understanding the mechanisms provoking virus-induced airway inflammation in asthmatic patients will likely offer significant opportunities for improved disease management. However, the reality at present is that current drugs for the treatment of virusinduced exacerbations are poorly effective, and alternative therapies to modulate viral pathogenesis are desperately needed. To this end, experimental human and murine models of rhinovirus-induced asthma exacerbations have now been developed, 109, 139 offering great potential to increase our mechanistic understanding, as well as providing us with models in which to test potential new therapies. Further study is clearly required to better understand the complicated relationships that exist among viruses, bacteria, and allergic inflammation. Despite the development of newer asthma medications, a recent survey of 2500 asthmatic patients highlighted that in the years between 1998 and 2009, the percentage seeking acute care for their asthma in the preceding 12 months had not changed significantly, 140, 141 This is a sobering truth indicative of how much we still need to do.",
