The beginning of the outbreak was identified as being through an association with a seafood market that sold live animals, which most of the initial patients had either worked at or had visited.(4) As the outbreak spread, person-to-person spread became the main mode of transmission. Personto-person spread is mainly through respiratory droplets, much like that of influenza.(4) With droplet transmission, the virus is released when an infected person coughs, sneezes or talks, and this then causes infection if it comes into direct contact with mucous membranes. Infection can also occur if a person touches an infected surface and then their eyes, nose or mouth. While droplets typically do not travel more than 2 m, experimental studies have suggested that the virus can remain viable in aerosols for up to 3 h at least.",

In one study from Italy, of patients who died of the infection, the mean number of pre-existing comorbidities was 2.7 and only three patients had no comorbid illness. (8) Other conditions or comorbidities that have been documented in some of the early descriptions of the SARS-CoV-2 cases in Wuhan include liver disease (cirrhosis), hyperlipidaemia, hyperuricaemia, cerebrovascular accident, Parkinson's disease, renal dysfunction and recent surgery.(9) Both with the SARS-CoV and the MERS-CoV epidemics, similar comorbidities were also noted, with hepatitis B infection being an additional risk factor for SARS, and obesity being an additional risk factor for MERS-CoV infection.

            "text": "Furthermore, a number of recent publications (in the scientific literature, from various organisations and even the lay press) have debated the issue of whether smoking, including the use of tobacco smoke, marijuana and vaping (as well as other substance abuse), may be a risk factor for SARS-CoV-2 infections, as well as the cause of more severe infections.(13-20) Some publications do suggest a relationship between smoking and risk of severe SARS-CoV-2 infection; for example, citing the much higher smoking rate of males in China compared with females and the associated higher mortality from SARS-CoV-2 in males in China, as well as the higher rate of need for ICU admission and mechanical ventilation and higher mortality in smokers versus non-smokers. (17) Other studies quote evidence, both from human and rat data, which confirm that smoking can increase the ACE-2 receptor in the respiratory tract, the receptor for SARS-CoV-2,(13) although other publications suggest that this association is less clear-cut. (14) Finally, a recent systematic review of the literature concluded that while further research on this topic was required, the limited data available, albeit not adjusted for other factors potentially impacting on outcome, concluded that smoking was most likely associated with negative progression and outcomes of SARS-CoV-2,(15) while a second meta-analysis concluded that active smoking was not associated with severity of SARS-CoV-2.(16) Nevertheless, despite this current uncertainty many organisations, such as the World Health Organization and the National Institute of Drug Abuse, recommend smoking cessation strategies not only to alleviate the harm caused by smoking, in general, but also because smoking cessation may potentially lessen the risks of SARS-CoV-2 infection. (19, 20) Is HIV infection a risk factor for SARS-CoV-2 and is it associated with more severe disease?",

            "text": "Thus, what can we extrapolate from influenza virus infections in PLWHIV, including those with and without concomitant TB? With regard to influenza, and recognizing that the SARS-CoV-2 virus is different from the influenza virus, there is no apparent increased risk of infection in HIV-infected persons; however, adults with AIDS experience a much higher influenza-related mortality, which decreases with the use of ART but does not disappear.(24) Furthermore, there is an increase in risk of influenza-associated mortality in persons with concomitant TB among both HIV-infected and non-infected cases, compared to that in patients without associated TB. (25) In addition, TB coinfection is associated with increased mortality in individuals with influenza, and influenza coinfection is associated with increased mortality in patients with TB.(26) Lastly, it is important to note that a study of the trivalent influenza virus showed it to be safe and efficacious in African HIV-infected adults without additional comorbidity, but further evaluation is required in severely immunocompromised HIV-infected persons, as well as in patients with additional comorbidities, including those with concomitant tuberculosis. (27) The studies reviewing the data for HIV-infected persons during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, as an example, were somewhat contradictory. One study suggested that there did not appear to be an increased risk of H1N1 infection in HIV-infected adults without advanced immunosuppression or other comorbid illnesses; however, risk factors for influenza infection, especially cigarette smoking, are more common in HIV-infected persons and these factors could modify the risk for influenza infections in such patients. (28) The same review indicated that HIV-infected patients with influenza may be at increased risk of hospitalization with H1N1 infection, but this may have been biased by decisions to test hospitalized patients with HIV infection and symptoms suggestive of H1N1 influenza infection. In hospitalized HIV-infected patients on ART and not severely immunocompromised, the disease severity and clinical outcomes were similar to that of HIV-uninfected persons. (28) However, another literature review indicated that while it was assumed that HIV infection would be a risk factor for more severe disease and death with H1N1 influenza infection, most cases, as with other immunocompromised individuals, recovered without major consequences. (29) There are very few published studies that have investigated directly the interaction between these novel coronaviruses and HIV infection, and therefore no conclusions can be reached regarding the impact of this coinfection. There is a single case report describing a patient with HIV infection who survived MERS-CoV pneumonia, (30) and another single case report of a patient with HIV who survived coinfection with SARS-CoV-2. In fact, the risk appears to be even lower than in the general population. It does not appear to be related to the use of antiretroviral agents in HIV-infected patients, such as use of the protease inhibitors. The absence of an increased risk of COVID-19 in PLWHIV was thought to be surprising because dysregulation of the immune response especially that which involves the T-lymphocyte system seems to be involved in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 infections, and the occurrence of lymphopenia is a recognized risk factor for the occurrence of ARDS and death among infected patients. Importantly, currently available data on host entry mechanisms and intracellular pathways harnessed by the HIV virus and the novel coronavirus do not show cooperative pathogenesis. While this may seem to be reassuring for PLWHIV, appropriate additional studies need to be conducted to address these issues and confirm these findings, before such reassurance can be given.",

This includes use of the influenza vaccine, particularly as low and middle-income countries in the southern hemisphere are now moving through autumn and on to winter, with an increased risk of influenza and other respiratory virus infections, including possibly SARS-CoV-2 infections. Furthermore, there should also be consideration for use of the pneumococcal vaccine, despite the increased costs, since pneumococcal infections also peak in winter and are clearly associated with an increased risk of co-infection with influenza.

The study of lopinavir-ritonavir, in addition to standard of care, versus standard of care alone did not show a significant difference in the primary objective of time to clinical improvement.(36) A further study was undertaken, in which the RNA-dependent polymerase (RdRp) of SARS-CoV-2 was modelled, validated and then targeted using anti-polymerase drugs currently registered for use against various viruses (Ribavirin, Remdesivir, Sofosbuvir, Galidesivir and Tenofovir).(37) RdRp is a crucial viral enzyme in the life cycle of RNA viruses. In that study, these antiviral agents were shown to be able to bind tightly to RdRp of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and thus could possibly be useful for the treatment of this infection.HOW IMPORTANT IS INFLUENZA AND PNEUMOCOCCAL VACCINATION AT THE CURRENT TIME IN SOUTH AFRICA?",
