Pharmacol Therap. 30,[218][219][220][221][222][223] This study evaluated the adverse effects of oral firocoxib in dogs. Six dogs (20.2 \u00b1 6.3 kg) were studied. Values for complete blood count (CBC), serum urea, creatinine, alanine transaminase, alanine phosphatase, c-glutamyl transferase, occult blood in feces, platelet aggregation, and buccal mucosal bleeding time were measured before and 7, 14, 21, and 29 days after SID treatment with firocoxib 5.3 \u00b1 0.34 mg/kg (FG) or lactose 1 mg/kg (LG) for 28 days, in a randomized crossover study. Gastrointestinal (GI) tract endoscopy was performed before treatment began and at 29 days. Lesions were scored from grade 0 to 6. Data were analyzed using ANOVA and paired t-tests (P < 0.05). None of the dogs presented adverse clinical effects. There were no significant changes in CBC, biochemical profiles within groups, or differences between groups. Pretreatment mean \u00b1 SD bleeding time (LG, 70.7 \u00b1 32.1 sec; FG, 75.8 \u00b1 38.1 sec) and platelet aggregation (LG, 86.4 \u00b1 10.2%; FG, 85.6 \u00b1 9.2%) were not significantly different from readings at 29 days (LG, 95.2 \u00b1 25 sec; FG, 91.7 \u00b1 24 sec and LG, 73.2 \u00b1 15.1%; FG, 84 \u00b1 10.3%) nor the groups were different. None of the dogs had positive fecal occult blood tests, and endoscopic lesion scores were grade 0 both before treatment and at 29 days. Administration of firocoxib did not cause any adverse effects on GI, or hematological or serum biochemical variables and appears to have been well tolerated by dogs.",

COX-1 isoform is a constitutive form of the enzyme found in many tissues and regulates normal homeostasis by producing prostaglandins in the gastrointestinal (GI) mucosa, and by platelet aggregation and renal blood flow. The COX-2 isoform is also constitutively expressed in a range of tissues and organs, including ovarian and renal tissue, but it is primarily induced by damage or tissue injury as a proinflammatory inducible enzyme and is responsible for the production of inducible enzymes which are converted into various eicosanoids, other specific prostaglandin end products which are inflammation mediators and amplify nociceptive input and transmission to the spinal cord (Fu et al., 1990; Kujubu et al., 1991; Lees et al., 2004) .",

NSAIDs were classified by Lees et al. (2004) , according to their capacity to inhibit the different COX isoforms. Based on this, they can be divided into nonselective inhibitors (aspirin, indomethacin, phenylbutazone, ketoprofen, meclofenamate), preferential COX-2 inhibitors (meloxicam, carprofen, nimesulide, etodolac and celecoxib), and selective COX-2 inhibitors (valdecoxib, rofecoxib, lumaricoxib, etoricoxib) . In dogs, carprofen can be considered as a strongly preferential COX-2 inhibitor or selective COX-2 inhibitor, on basis of in vitro ratios. Deracoxib and firocoxib are selective COX-2 inhibitors for veterinary use (Lees et al., 2004; McCann et al., 2004) . Another drug class is called dual inhibitors of NSAIDs: liclofelone and tepoxalin inhibit both COX and 5-lipooxygenase (Lees et al., 2004) .",

In clinical reports, firocoxib was highly effective and acceptable for controlling pain and inflammation associated with osteoarthritis in dogs Pollmeier et al., 2006; Ryan et al., 2006) ; and dogs with experimentally induced synovitis, treated with firocoxib were significantly less lame than those treated with carprofen (McCann et al., 2004) . Although no serious drug-related adverse effects were reported in these studies Pollmeier et al., 2006; Ryan et al., 2006) , there are no studies evaluating the occurrence of adverse effects under controlled laboratory conditions. More information is needed concerning the possible adverse effects of selective COX-2 inhibitors in dogs. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety of firocoxib orally administered to healthy dogs for 28 days. Endoscopy and blood and fecal analysis were used to examine and compare the gastroduodenal and hemostatic safety profile of firocoxib. ",

The development of COX-2 selective NSAIDs aims to improve the overall balance between efficacy and safety (Lascelles et al., 2005a) . Firocoxib was the first veterinary NSAID that is a selective COX-2 inhibitor (McCann et al., 2004) . This study supports the evidence for the benefits of COX-2 selectivity in causing less GI side effects. However, even COX-2 selective drugs are not side-effect free. In a recent report, rofecoxib, another selective COX-2 inhibitor was given to dogs for 56 days and caused severe gastric, duodenal, and gastroduodenal mucosal damage compared with placebo treatment (Moreau et al., 2005) . Although rofecoxib is not approved and licensed for dogs, further studies evaluating the long-term use of firocoxib in dogs are necessary to know if the drug could cause similar GI damage to rofecoxib.",

Vomiting was the most common finding in <2% of that study population and also in another one involving 218 dogs (Pollmeier et al., 2006; Ryan et al., 2006) . The absence of side effects in our study might be due to the small number of animals used. However, another study using the same number of dogs (n \u00bc 6), lesion scores, and the same veterinarian performing the gastroscopies after 90 days of treatment, the prevalence of GI lesions showed that long-term use of NSAIDs (carprofen, flunixin, meloxicam, ketoprofen and etodolac) caused gastric lesions and clinical signs of GI damage (Luna et al., 2007) . Our findings, even with a small number of dogs, suggest the safety of firocoxib and are in accordance with previous clinical studies where its long-term use was well tolerated in dogs with osteoarthritis Pollmeier et al., 2006; Ryan et al., 2006) . This study cannot be extrapolated to a clinical setting in which patients typically undergo painful surgical procedures and receive NSAIDs for several weeks afterwards. In such circumstances, GI lesions may be exacerbated and result in clinical consequences. Endoscopy is considered a sensitive method for detecting early NSAID-induced gastric injury in dogs. Gross endoscopic evaluation of gastric lesions correlates with gross lesions at necropsy and is therefore a reliable method of evaluating ulceration and gastric adverse effects (Dow et al., 1990; Boston et al., 2003) . Animals may show gastric lesions in endoscopy, even if they do not present any clinical signs of side effects from the use of NSAIDs (Moreau et al., 2005; Dowers et al., 2006; Luna et al., 2007) . In this study, firocoxib did not cause any abnormal signs of GI toxicity or lesions, or any laboratory abnormalities when compared with healthy dogs where lactose was administered. In another study, dogs receiving carprofen and deracoxib for only 5 days showed gastric lesions during endoscopy (Dowers et al., 2006) . However, the presence of ulcers might have been due to the short evaluation periods in that study (Dowers et al., 2006) . In our study, endoscopy was performed before and after 28 days treatment, enough time for the gastric adaptation phenomenon (Graham et al., 1988; Papich, 1997; Dowers et al., 2006) . Evaluation of the mechanisms involved in NSAIDinduced GI injury was beyond the scope of this study.",

Hepatotoxicosis has been associated with the use of carprofen and other NSAIDs in dogs (MacPhail et al., 1998) and is generally considered an idiosyncratic reaction. The number of dogs used in this study was too low to draw a proper conclusion, but other studies have not detected hepatotoxic effects from the use of firocoxib in dogs Pollmeier et al., 2006; Ryan et al., 2006) . Some of our dogs had increased ALT and GGT values but these were not firocoxib related as some of them were also found in the lactose group. The reasons for increased serum ALT activity in one lactose-treated dog before and at 7, 21, and 28 days are unknown. After the end of the study, this dog was submitted to abdominal ultrasound which did not reveal any abnormality. Another dog treated with firocoxib had increased serum GGT activity at 7 and 14 days but its subsequent GGT values were within reference values. This increased GGT activity was not apparently related to firocoxib. Primary hemostasis is mediated by the interaction between vascular endothelium and platelets. Inhibition of COX-1 activity by nonselective NSAIDs decreases thromboxane A2 formation and therefore can reduce blood platelet aggregation disturbing or even inhibiting primary hemostasis (Fresno et al., 2005) . Bleeding time determination is the best in vivo test because it is inexpensive and a quick means of assessing primary hemostasis (Fresno et al., 2005) . In this study, BMBT, platelet count and blood platelet aggregation values were not altered during firocoxib administration. Results suggest that firocoxib, given at the recommended therapeutic dose, did not impair primary hemostasis in healthy dogs.",
