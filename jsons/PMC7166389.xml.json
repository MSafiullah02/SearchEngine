A postmortem diagnosis of septicemia was based on the presence of one or more of the following criteria: (1) morphologic changes such as multiple disseminated abscesses of similar size, purulent vasculitis and intravascular identification of bacteria, or fibrin in multiple body cavities; (2) bacterial isolation from heart blood; or (3) recovery of the same bacterial organism from \u22652 body tissues (excluding intestine). The pathogens causing diarrhea were also recorded. Duration of hospitalization was based on either the number of days until the calf was discharged from the hospital or on the number of days until death.

Normality of the data was tested by the Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov test. Forward stepwise regression (P < .05 to enter and exit) was performed to determine the relationship between measured plasma pH and SID3, SIG, pCO2, and Atot for DS1 and DS2, and to determine the relationship between calculated plasma HCO3\n\u2212 and SID3, SIG, pCO2, and Atot for DS1 and DS2. The assumptions of the forward stepwise regression procedure were evaluated by examining the residual plots. The results of the regression were confirmed using backward elimination. To evaluate the association between the acid\u2013base variables and alteration of calf demeanor, both DS1 and DS2 were compiled as a single data set. Before combining them, the 2 data sets were analyzed separately and residual standard deviation of the variables of interest was compared and was found to be similar. A two\u2010way ANOVA was performed to investigate the association between acid\u2013base variables from the H\u2013H (pCO2, BE(ecf), [HCO3\n\u2212] and AG) and the physicochemical approach (pCO2, SID3, SIG and Atot), and attitude, posture, and strength of the suckle reflex. The additive effect of DS1 and DS2 also was investigated in the ANOVA test but it did not have statistical significance (P > .05). Bonferroni correction for pairwise comparison was performed when indicated. The appropriateness of the results of the ANOVA test was evaluated by the examination of residual plots. A P\u2010value <.05 was considered significant. Statistical analyses were performed using statistical software.5\n",

Stewart's major contribution to the understanding of clinical acid\u2013base physiology was his proposal that plasma [H+] is determined by 3 independent factors: pCO2, [SID], and Atot\n\u2212.9 SID has 2 components: measured SID and unmeasured SID (SIDum).7 The simplified strong ion approach quantifies the unmeasured strong ions by calculating the SIG from values of plasma or serum concentration of strong anions and strong cations, the total protein or albumin concentration, and experimentally determined values of Atot and pKa in calf plasma, and can be used interchangeably for SIDum.7, 10, 32 Theoretically, [SID] can be altered in several ways to produce metabolic acidosis, such as a reduction in [Na+], an increase in [Cl\u2212], endogenous production of strong anions (l\u2010lactic acidosis), absorption of strong anions (d\u2010lactic acidosis), and impaired excretion of unmeasured anions (uremic acids).7, 33, 34 Plasma electrolyte disorders including hyponatremia, in the presence of normochloremia or hyperchloremia, were observed in some of the calves in these data sets and were the likely cause of the decreased of the SID3. This finding confirms the important role of hyponatremia, attributed to excessive loss of sodium into the gastrointestinal tract and decreased milk intake because of anorexia,6, 35, 36 in producing acidemia and strong ion acidosis in calves with diarrhea.7\n",

Similar results were reported previously in sick calves in which SIDum and SID3 accounted for 58\u201375% of the changes of the calculated pH; it was presumed that [d\u2010lac\u2212] was the predominant unmeasured anion.7 Hyper\u2010d\u2010lactatemia occurs frequently in diarrheic calves.21, 22, 23[d\u2010lac\u2212] acid is a major contributor to anion gap acidosis, accounting for approximately 64% of the total increase in organic acids in plasma.21 Malabsorption of nutrients in the small intestine of patients with short bowel syndrome and subsequent fermentation by colonic bacteria result in d\u2010lactic acidosis in humans.37\nd\u2010lactate concentrations are significantly higher in rumen content, feces, serum, and urine in diarrheic calves with acidemia as compared to normal calves.22, 38 Our findings support the clinically useful application of SID theory in the calculation of the SIG to quantify the unmeasured strong anion concentration such as [d\u2010lac\u2212] and [l\u2010lac\u2212] in calves with diarrhea, and the calculation of SID3 to quantify the effects of [Na+] and [Cl\u2212] on acid\u2013base status.39\n",

There is a strong evidence that neonatal diarrhea predisposes calves to septicemia.3, 28, 40, 41, 42 One of the most important consequences of the septicemia is the compromise of organ perfusion because of the arterial hypotension. Furthermore, endotoxin impairs oxygen extraction by tissues.43 As a result, anaerobic glycolysis, combined with direct inhibition of pyruvate dehydrogenase by endotoxin, generates severe l\u2010lactic acidosis.44, 45 Contradictory results regarding the contribution of the concentration of [l\u2010lac\u2212] to the acidemia in diarrheic calves have been reported. In some studies, the contribution of [l\u2010lac\u2212] to the metabolic acidosis in calves with diarrhea has been attributed to the severity of the dehydration and the age of the calf,19, 22 whereas other studies have shown that [l\u2010lac\u2212] was a minor contributor the acidemia in diarrheic or severely dehydrated calves.22, 26, 46 The results of this study revealed that a high proportion of the calves were dehydrated and had strong ion metabolic acidosis, and that one\u2010third were considered to be septicemic, 70% of which did not survive. These findings suggest that some of the calves were in a progressive or irreversible phase of hypovolemic or septic shock or both where hypotension and hypoperfusion develop, leading to an increase in plasma [l\u2010lac\u2212], which could have contributed in part to the increased concentration of the unmeasured strong ions detected by the calculation of the SIG.47\nl\u2010lactate concentrations were not measured in the calves included in this study.",

Early studies demonstrated that demeanor and posture in calves with diarrhea were influenced by the degree of metabolic acidosis,16 and that base deficit had the strongest correlation with alteration of demeanor,16, 24 behavior,24 and suckle reflex.20, 24 Conversely, a recent study failed to demonstrate that severe, uncomplicated, hyperchloremic acidosis was associated with the demeanor abnormalities accompanying neonatal calves with diarrhea.25 Calves with naturally acquired diarrhea have variations in behavior, posture, and palpebral reflex, but not in the suckle reflex, that could be better explained by increases in serum [d\u2010lac\u2212] than by decreases in base excess.24 Both natural and experimentally induced hyper\u2010d\u2010lactatemia in calves produced an impaired palpebral reflex, somnolence, and a staggering gait, but no impairment of the suckling reflex.18, 50 It has been suggested than metabolic acidosis without appreciable increase in [d\u2010lac\u2212] has only a minor influence on posture and behavior of calves with diarrhea51; however, posture and especially demeanor normalized after correction of the acidemia with sodium bicarbonate despite a persistent increase in [d\u2010lac\u2212] concentration in calves with diarrhea and metabolic acidosis.51 Moreover, in 1 study of calves with naturally acquired diarrhea and strong ion acidosis that were treated with intravenous solution of sodium, behavior was normalized despite of the persistent increases in [d\u2010lac\u2212] above 3 mmol/L.30 In this retrospective study SID3 and pCO2 did not correlate with changes in attitude, suckle reflex and posture; additionally, Atot was not significantly correlated with attitude and suckle response although it did correlate with posture. This supports the hypothesis that unmeasured strong anions including [d\u2010lac\u2212], [l\u2010lac\u2212], and uremic anions can be the major cause for deteriorating demeanor parameters, and suggest that fluid volume replacement to re\u2010establish tissue perfusion and diuresis with polyionic crystalloid alkalinizing solution is crucial for the treatment of calves with diarrhea.",

Secondly, the data were collected from 2 different retrospective data sets, which can increase the limitations and inaccuracies of the retrospective studies. A further validation of these results through a prospective study is warranted. Finally, 1 potential limitation of this study was the use of 2 different blood gas analyzers with 2 different values of S and pK1\u2032 for calculation of plasma HCO3\n\u2212 from pCO2 and pH values.52 Assigned values for S and pK1\u2032 for DS1 were 0.0306 mmol/L/mmHg and 6.099 mmol/L, respectively; assigned values for S and pK1\u2032 for DS2 were 0.0307 mmol/L/mmHg and 6.095 mmol/L, respectively. However, the rearrangement of the H\u2013H equation as pH = [(\u2212log10K1 \u2212 log10(S)] + log10 (HCO3\n\u2212/pCO2) permitted the combination of the 2 constants into one, expressed as [pK1 \u2212 log10(S)]. Substituting S and pK1\u2032 for the assigned values for each blood gas resulted in [6.099 + 1.514 = 7.613] for DS1 and [6.095 + 1.513 = 7.608] for DS2; these values differ by 0.066%.
