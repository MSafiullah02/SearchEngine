            "text": "The effects of influenza have been replicated in a study of naturally occurring illnesses involving virological techniques to identify the infecting agent (Smith et al. 1993b). While studies of naturally occurring colds have confirmed that such illnesses reduce subjective ratings of alertness and lead to psychomotor slowing (Hall and Smith 1996, Smith et al. 1995\nSmith et al. 1997) no experiments have been conducted which relate these effects to the nature of the infecting virus. Indeed, we do not know whether confirmed infections produce similar effects to those clinical illnesses where the virus is unknown. In addition, the differences between influenza and cold infections suggest that the nature of the infecting agent may be crucial. Data from studies of experimentally-induced infections suggest that many effects of different cold producing viruses on performance are similar. However, subjective mood ratings have shown different effects of coronavirus colds and those following infection with rhinoviruses, with the coronavirus leading to reduced ratings of subjective alertness and the rhinovirus colds being associated with much smaller changes in mood (Smith et al., 1992). These differences may not reflect the viruses but may be due to variation in the severity or length of the cold. This issue was examined here. Research on naturally occurring colds (Hall and Smith 1996) has failed to replicate results obtained following infection with respiratory syncytial viruses (RSV). Given that it is unlikely that the young adults with naturally occurring colds had RSV infections it does appear plausible that even different cold producing viruses may produce different effects on mood and performance. This issue was addressed here by examining the effects of colds following rhinovirus and coronavirus infections.",

            "text": "These two studies confirm that naturally occurring colds reduce subjective alertness and hedonic tone and impair psychomotor tasks. Detection tasks involving selective attention were unimpaired by these illnesses. The effects of the cold were present in illnesses following coronavirus infection and when the infecting agent was a rhinovirus. Illnesses following a verified infection produced similar effects to those where no infecting agent was isolated and where classification was based on clinical symptoms and signs. Overall, these results confirm findings at the MRC Common Cold Unit with experimentally induced illnesses and previous studies of real life colds where no virology was carried out. The mood effects were related to subjective reports of symptoms but were not related to length of illness or amount of nasal secretion. The slowing of simple reaction time was not correlated with subjective reports of symptom severity nor duration of illness or amount of nasal secretion. The phenomena appear, therefore, to be genuine and robust. Indeed, the magnitude of the impairments should also be noted (a slowing of reaction time of \u223c10%) as they are comparable with known hazards such as working at night or consuming a moderate amount of alcohol (Smith et al., 1987b). It should also be pointed out that other research shows that these illnesses not only have direct effects on mood and performance but can exacerbate the effects of other factors (volunteers with colds show larger impairments when exposed to noise (Smith et al., 1993a) or given small amounts of alcohol (Smith et al., 1995)). Further research must identify the neuroimmunological mechanisms underlying the effects, assess the impact on real life activities, and aim to develop therapies which not only provide symptomatic relief but remove the behavioural problems produced by upper respiratory tract illnesses.",
