The participants have access to a stream of social media entries and they have to balance between making early alerts (e.g., based on few entries or posts) or not-so-early (late) alerts (e.g., if participants opt to see a wider range of entries and only emit alerts after thoroughly analyzing the available pieces of evidence).

            "text": "The test collections used in the eRisk early detection tasks have the same format as the collection described in [3] . It is a collection of writings (posts or comments) published by redditors. For each task, there are two classes of redditors: the positive class (e.g., depression or anorexia) and the negative class (control group). The positive class was obtained following the extraction method proposed by Coppersmith and colleagues [2] (an automatic approach to identify people diagnosed with depression in Twitter). We adapted this extraction approach to Reddit as follows. Self-expressions related to medical diagnoses (e.g. \"Today, I was diagnosed with depression\") can be obtained by running specific phrases against the platform search tool. Next, we manually reviewed the retrieved results to verify that they were really genuine. Our confidence on the reliability of these labels is high. There are many subreddits oriented to people suffering from psychological disorders and, usually, many redditors are active on these subreddits. These users tend to be very explicit about their problems and medical condition. This extraction approach is semi-automatic (requires manual revision of the retrieved posts), but it is an effective way to extract a group of people that are diagnosed with a given disorder. The manual reviews were thorough and strict. Expressions such as \"I have anorexia\", \"I think I have anorexia\", or \"I am anorexic\" were not considered as explicit expressions of a diagnosis. We only included a user into the positive set when there was a mention of a diagnosis that was clear and explicit (e.g., \"Last month, I was diagnosed with anorexia nervosa\", \"After struggling with anorexia for a long time, last week I was diagnosed\"). For each redditor, the test collection contains his sequence of writings (in chronological order) and each task was organized into a Training stage, where the participants had access to training data (we released the full history of writings published by a set of training redditors), and a Test stage. In eRisk 2017 and eRisk 2018, the test stage was organized in a 10-week format as follows. The sequence of writings published by each user was split into 10 chunks (the first chunk has the oldest 10% of the user's writings, the second chunk has the second oldest 10%, and so forth). The test stage had 10 releases of data (one release per week). The first week we gave the first chunk of data to the participants, the second week we gave the second chunk of data, and so forth. After each release, the participants had to process the data and, before the next release, each participant had to choose between: (a) emitting a decision on the redditor (positive or negative), or (b) making no decision (i.e. waiting to see more chunks). This choice had to be made for each redditor in the test set.",

We set up a REST server that iteratively provided the user's writings to the participants 2 .

The evaluation of these tasks considered standard classification measures, such as F1, Precision and Recall, computed with respect to the positive group. These standard classification measures evaluate the participants' estimations with respect to golden truth labels. eRisk included them in the evaluation reports because these measures are well-known and interpretable. However, these three measures are time-unaware and, thus, do not penalize late alerts. In order to reward early detection algorithms, we introduced in [3] a new measure called ERDE (Early Risk Detection Error). ERDE takes into account the correctness of the (binary) decision and the delay, which is measured by counting the number (k) of writings seen before making the decision.",

We complemented the evaluation report with additional decision-based metrics that try to capture additional aspects of the problem. We adopted F latency , an alternative evaluation metric for early risk prediction that was proposed by Sadeque and colleagues [7] . Another novelty introduced in 2019 was that user's data was processed by the participants in a post by post basis (as opposed to the old chunk-based approach). Besides decision-based evaluation metrics, eRisk 2019 incorporated a ranking-based approach to evaluate the participants. This form of evaluation was based on rankings of users by decreasing estimated risk. These rankings were produced after each round of writings and were evaluated with standard information retrieval measures, such as P@10 or NDCG. A full description of this ranking-based evaluation approach can be found in the eRisk 2019's overview report [6] .",

            "text": "eRisk will continue at CLEF 2020. Our plan is to organize two shared tasks. The first task will be a continuation of 2019's eRisk task on early detection of signs of self-harm. The second task will be a continuation of 2019's task on depression level estimation. In 2019, these two tasks were really challenging and the participants had no training data. In 2020, we will use the eRisk 2019 data as training data, and new test cases will be collected and included into the 2020 test split. By running these two tasks again we expect to further gain insight into the main factors and issues related to extracting signs of self-harm and depression from Social Media entries.",
