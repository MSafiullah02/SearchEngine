How can Robespierre's actions be understood or presented in visual format? The assignment has students select episodes from Robespierre's rule and illustrate them. Students could also focus on symbols such as the guillotine to offer a new and different understanding of this period. As mentioned in the previous chapters, students must also consider character position, emotional responses, shading, panels, and encapsulation, nonlinear considerations, and synecdoche to truly convey a myriad of ideas.",

While the students are striving for accuracy in portraying the leader they chose, the students are putting their stamp on the work. The thematic statement can be used to achieve this task and give the students direction, as well as allow the teacher to see this direction early on. One student may think Robespierre is a monster, whereas another student may think he was an effective leader. When comics are finished, students can present them to the class and other students can give a critique or ask questions. (If done online, this can be done with comments on a discussion board.)

Rather, they can create fictional leaders, alternate universes, or postapocalyptic stories to convey these meanings. If students do create fictional leaders, it may make sense to have these leaders parallel real-life leaders. So, a Robespierre-like figure may command a region or nation in a post-apocalyptic world (Jessica Abel recounts how she created a story which combined the ideas of Euripides and space travel!). The fictional leader, based on reality, can give the student room to explore themes and not have to worry about being historically accurate. Further, if students do create a fictional leader and have more room for creativity, the notion of a story arc may be incorporated. Abel and Madden (2008) and Potts (2013) talk about the importance of the story or narrative arc for comics (and good writing in general). A story arc is some type of event or situation which disrupts that normal situation of the protagonist. A number of occurrences between the protagonists and antagonists then take place. Finally, there is the climax and a resolution (Abel & Madden, 2008, 127; Potts, 2013, 100) . Teachers will most likely have to discuss the notion of a story arc, as well as protagonists and antagonists, with their students.",

And while the above activities were created with a field trip in mind, they could just as easily be done without going on a field trip. Students could research the pertinent information and do the assignments. Further, I have used American Civil War sites as examples, but these assignments can be done with a variety of topics. Learning from a historical site takes place in a variety of forms. There are written placards, artifacts (some real, some replicas), tour guides, informational movies, museums, and pamphlets among other things. There is so much information, even I get overwhelmed. But a neat way for students to organize the information can be to put it in visual form. This will most likely require some pre-organization by the instructor.

At Antietam, the actions of the relevant generals are the subject of most of the sites. The actions of General Robert E. Lee or the Union General Ambrose Burnside and many others are dissected by placards and tour guides. Their decisions (as well as factors out of their control such as natural conditions and army size) dictated the outcome of the battle (A good overview of the Battle of Antietam can be found here https://www.nps.gov/anti/index. htm). Teachers can have their students reflect on the decisions of these leaders and then illustrate episodes of the battle. Teachers could have students reflect on leadership qualities they see in the generals or prep them first with some leadership ideas and theories to look for by utilizing the leadership chart from Chapter 3. While there is a focus on leadership, students will obviously absorb factual information pertaining to the site as well. The teachers could require that the information be taken from placards or tour guides and that the students must write down or cite exactly where the information came from. I have created some questions below. These are specific to sites I have visited, but could obviously be adapted to a wide array of historical sites.",

One student could be required to research Ambrose Burnside's actions at the battle and reflect on his leadership capabilities. Another student could be required to research General Lee's actions and leadership capacities at the battle. The third student could research Lincoln's reaction to the battle and aftermath. Each student would have to create a frame or frames to showcase their ideas. The same rules would apply here. The students would have to cite placards and park rangers to build their comic. Finally, the students would come together and find the most optimal way to combine their comics. There are endless variations of this exercise as well as various options for the teacher to consider. How many students should be in a group? How much information should the teacher assign? Should the teacher assign leaders or let students pick? How many frames should students draw?

Further, the above assignments focused on a specific event, the American Civil War, where the activity below takes a broader approach. I used my nine-year-old daughter as a test subject for this assignment. While this book is written mainly for high school and college students, my daughter was able to provide important feedback on the assignment-if she understood it, then a high schooler surely would be able to as well ( Fig. 5 .1). My daughter and I visited the home of James Buchanan, the 15th President of the United States. His home is located in Lancaster Pennsylvania. He served one term from 1857 to 1861. Marino and Crocco (2012) noted how the town of New Brunswick, New Jersey, which they chose to study as local history, is not as recognizable as other more well-known places. Yet, a great deal of history happened there. Similarly, Buchanan is not as recognizable as let's say Abraham Lincoln, but this I think made the assignment more interesting in some ways. Students presumably know more about famous presidents and leaders. But what about everyone else? What about mediocre or average leaders? These people had a role in events as well and it makes sense to study them. In fact, many of these mediocre or average leaders had a big hand in events, as did Buchanan (for better or for worse and with Buchanan, most agree it was for the worst). Teachers might do well to seek out interesting local leaders or people who are not as well-known and have students study their actions to show students that history is not simply the province of a few famous people.",

Nevertheless, I still think students can skillfully utilize imagery even in shorter comics, they just might have to work a little harder. In addition, as noted in Chapter 3, symbolism in comics can be in word, image, or story (Langley, 2018) .

The first student had to draw an earlier episode. One of the earliest policies we spoke about was the Civil Rights Act and one of the earliest cases we spoke about was Lau v. Nichols in 1974 (Imber, Geel, Blokhuis, & Feldman, 2014) . Students had to work together-and build off each other's ideas-to create a sequential story. Some ended with Donald Trump's now-infamous campaign speech where he stated that Mexicans were rapists, others ended by showing barbed wire on the border (Mark, 2018) . This activity can be done with any topic or time period. As I stressed to my students, case law and policy does not happen in a vacuum, there are surrounding historical conditions. In addition, my class discussed on many occasions that policies and cases are not enough to change people, there also needs to be an attitudinal and moral shift for true change to occur.

Her blindfold represents equality before the law, the scales represent deliberation, and the sword represents enforcement. As noted in Chapter 3, Justice Jackson, in the landmark majority opinion for West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette in 1943, also noted the power of symbols. He wrote that the use of symbols such as flags or emblems act as \"a short cut from mind to mind.\" Jackson also comments on the variable nature within symbols and how different people react differently to the same symbols: \"A person gets from a symbols the meaning he puts into it, and what is one man's comfort and inspiration is another's jest and concern\" (West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette, 1943) . As noted previously, symbols can carry different meanings for different individuals, this is the notion of multivocality (Gill & Angosto-Ferrandez, 2018) . Indeed, the Barnette case was fought over symbols. These passages can act as a segue into a larger discussion of national symbols, such as flags, emblems, as well as images such as lady justice. The graphic novel Uncle Sam, created by Alex Ross and Steve Darnell is replete with these types of symbols. Uncle Sam, the Soviet Bear, the French Marianne, all come into play. I have also mentioned Alan Moore and David Lloyd's use of Lady Justice in V for Vendetta. The assignment below is meant to get students thinking with national symbols and creating their own.",

            "text": "For this exercise, I also provide an example that I have created. My example consists of two frames. The first frame has what seems to be a random collection of items. There is an armband, a newspaper, and banner, a speech bubble with the phrase \"sexual innuendo,\" a banner with the word \"Jesus\" on it, a computer, and a boy standing with his arm raised. The next panel contains the same items (except there is a girl sitting at a desk while the pledge of allegiance is being recited), but this time, the backdrop is the constitution, specifically the 1st amendment. Further, the computer, the banner, the speech bubble, and the newspaper all have a line going through them. There is a caption that reads \"The law finds its expression in the oddest of places.\" I have attempted to create a sequence metaphor. The six items by themselves do not mean much, they only have a meaning when juxtaposed together with the second image and the understanding of the 1st amendment. These items refer to cases that I assign to my students to read. The cases are: West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette (1943) , Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District (1969 ), Bethel School District no. 403 v. Fraser (1986 ), Hazelwood School District v. Kuhlmeier (1988 ), Morse v. Frederick (2007 and Kowalski v. Berkeley County Public Schools (2011) (this case was not a Supreme Court case). The items all have to do with the details of each case. The West Virginia case centered on whether compulsorily flag salutes were constitutional. The court said they were not. The Tinker case centered on students protesting the Vietnam War by wearing armbands to school. The court said this was protected speech. The Hazelwood case centered on the freedom of the press in school publications. The court ruled that the principal, who pulled two articles from the school newspaper, did not violate students' first amendment rights. The Bethel case centered on the students' use of lewd speech. The court said that lewd speech is not protected. The Frederick case was about student expression related to drug use at school supervised events. The court ruled that schools can discipline student speech related to drug use at these events (Oyez, n.d.) . The Kowalski case hinged on off-campus speech via social media and cyberbullying. In this case it was permissible for the school to discipline the student who created a MySpace page which bullied another student (Imber et al., 2014) . Dayton (2012, xiii) argues how the law is predicated on abstract notions but at the same time \"governs every aspect of our daily lives from birth through death.\" I assign this passage to my students, and we discuss it in class. My sequence metaphor tries to convey this idea that we are working with extremely abstract and philosophical ideas, but they find expression in everyday situations (e.g., armbands, banners, etc.).",

The next week, as part of their assigned online module assignment, students had to create their own sequence metaphor and post it to a discussion board. They were then supposed to offer comments on another classmate's sequence metaphor. I have found that sometimes it is good to give students some time to think about what to draw. Similar to wait time (Chapin, 2015) , I think students simply need time to think and process what to draw and what symbols to use. I even need time to think about it. In fact, I had become frustrated for this assignment because I could not think of a good sequence metaphor. So, I put it away and then the idea randomly hit me as I was grocery shopping with my wife and daughter. So, I present the idea early, give students my expectations, and then let the ideas germinate. In addition, I wanted to see how some of these assignments will look online. Online education should be stimulating and intellectually challenging (Quality Matters Website, 2019), and I felt that symbol creation would be a great way to accomplish this feat. In addition, as I write this, the COVID-19 pandemic is raging and almost all schools, both K-12 schools and institutions of higher education, are moving their lessons online. In the future, as schools turn more to online education, I believe that comic activities can be one means of providing more challenging and meaningful online activities. As noted earlier, reflection on a piece of arts-based research is good practice (Barone & Eisner, 2012) . With an online discussion board, students can reflect on their own work and other's work as well. The last question has students commenting on other students' work online. In class, when we meet again, we then go through the comments and have a face to face discussion.",

I think both modalities generated an interesting conversation. In the face-to-face setting, students were able to ask spontaneous questions and learn even more about their classmate's use of symbols. One student remarked how illustrating cases also helped her remember the cases. To be sure, not everyone loved the drawing component, but all the students did a great job and were able to articulate their use of symbols clearly. A student example is featured in Fig. 5 .2. Notice how she utilized the \"schoolhouse gate\" reference from the Tinker Supreme Court Case. Constellation Symbol Activity Arnheim (1997) writes: \"A symbol gives particular shape to types of things or constellations of forces\" (Arnheim, 1997, 138 ). Arnheim's ideas of symbolism served as inspiration for this assignment. I utilized this definition to create my own assignment. A symbol stands for a constellation of forces. But what does this actually mean? For this assignment, it means that symbols are more than what they denote, there is not a simple one to one correspondence. These symbols can be personal symbols as well as political symbols. I started with a personal symbol from my own life to illustrate the point. I use this example in class.",

The President of the United States (and the presidential seal) may be another type of symbol. The notion of president (depending on who occupies the office) can mean multiple things; good leadership, bad leadership, a paragon of morality, or a buffoon. Any understanding of symbols will obviously contain a high degree of subjectivity. Nevertheless, it can make for fruitful discussions.

In the middle panel, I drew two presidents, who are usually considered some of the most effective (but of course this is debatable). Abraham Lincoln and Franklin D. Roosevelt. Behind each president is a symbol of what made their presidency awful or great for me. For example, behind Buchanan I drew a picture of the United States breaking in half.

This activity could easily be adapted to any history class either at the secondary or college level. While it will vary for any teacher or professor, this activity took me roughly a month to get through. Prior to this project, my class was run like most history classes are probably run. Students were assigned textbook readings, articles, and primary sources. In class we discussed those readings. I believe we had some great discussions (or the students could have been bored to death), but either way, the class was more traditional. During the comic book assignment, I was able to venture out a little. During this project, I stressed to my students that what they were doing aligned in many ways with Arnheim's (1997) notion of visual thinking, Barone and Eisner's (2012) notion of arts-based research, as well as Duncombe's (2019) notion of the ethical spectacle and Duncombe and Lambert's (n.d.) idea of art activism. I think student-created comics can be a GPS of sorts through hyperreality, a way to orient citizens through bullshit. This is how students can envision this assignment. Students were not creating something with no connection to reality, but rather, using the real, whether that was historical analysis, theories, or whatever, to create something better. Their comics were empirical in that sense because they drew on real-life ideas, but ultimately the comics used the real to disrupt the status quo or point to something better.",

Further this creation and/or critique will make use of symbolism and imagery, and the related ideas of sequence metaphors, symbols as constellations, nonlinear elements, and stereotypes. When creating symbols and imagery, it is also important to stress that art can have a number of meanings (Duncombe & Lambert, n.d.) . Student art does not have to specifically mean one thing or another, but can and should be left open to interpretation.",

Nevertheless, story elements could be introduced into this assignment. I do think it important to point out however that students are not only drawing with symbols, but most likely, will utilize words. As noted in Chapter 1, this is a fruitful feature to create meaning.",

Before you draw, you must first write a thematic statement (Potts, 2013, 105) which briefly outlines the \"unifying theme\" of the story, to give you some direction. Or, more appropriately for this project, you must write a \"dream statement.\" The dream statement is a succinct statement of the dream you will create in comic form.

I posed the question of how the spectacle could be utilized to practice justice-oriented citizenship. I think this all centers on imagination. In an email correspondence, Duncombe also stated that he believes there is a crisis in imagination (Duncombe, email communication, April 26, 2019) . Indeed, Wolk (2007, 133) bluntly states: \"One gauge of the goodness of comics is how much they excite the imagination-what the reader perceives beyond and between the border of their panels.\" Needless to say, I think comic creation can fire the imagination in new ways. Weiner (2007, 69) also talks about the \"hegemony of realism\" which is a state of affairs where it is believed the future cannot be very different from the present. This hegemony can be broken with \"transgressive acts of the imagination\" (Weiner, 2007, 69) . I contend that comics can be this transgressive act.",

I compared the Obama presidency to the Trump presidency. For Obama, I drew five equal-size frames. For Trump, I drew five erratic and asymmetrical frames. The point was to show how erratic, contradictorily, and just plain crazy the Trump presidency is compared to the even keel, predictable (if not a little boring, see Duncombe) Obama presidency was. This comparison lent itself nicely to the frame drawing exercise. My students then represented many aspects from the history of education, most of which blossomed into full fledge ideas later on. One student began to experiment with frames and lines to convey historical notions, specifically racism. The Sousanis exercise can call attention to both diegetic time and reader pacing. As mentioned in Chapter 1, it is important to note that while larger panels do generally mean a larger portion of time, this is not a hard and fast rule.",

I had to address some historical interpretations with students. Sometimes symbols could convey a misleading historical ideabut I had to balance this with the fact that students can use symbols and images in novel ways to create new ways to see history. I tried to stress with my students that what they created were new ways to see history and the present that aligned with justice-oriented citizenship ideas, and further, and that they challenged injustice in new ways. Figure 5. 1: This is an example of a student-created comic for the Leadership Field Trip Assignment. This comic was actually created by my nineyear-old daughter. In this sequence, she depicted the Dred Scott decision, Buchanan's reaction, the election of Abraham Lincoln, the beginning of the Civil War, and Buchanan's reaction. Figure 5 .2: This is an example of a student-created comic for the Sequence Metaphor Activity. In this comic, the student played on the symbol of the Statue of Liberty.
