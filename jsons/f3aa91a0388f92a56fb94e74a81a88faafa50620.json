Methods: To evaluate CTHRC1 and NFE2L3 as cancer biomarkers, it was generated and characterised several novel specific polyclonal antibodies (PAb), monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) and soluble Fab fragments (sFabs) against recombinant CTHRC1 and NFE2L3 proteins, which were obtained from different sources, including a human antibody library and immunised animals. The antibodies and Fab fragments were tested for recognition of native CTHRC1 and NFE2L3 proteins by immunoblotting analysis and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in colorectal cell lines derived from tumour and cancer tissues. Results: Both, antibodies and a Fab fragment showed high specificity since they recognised only their corresponding recombinant antigens, but not a panel of different unrelated-and related proteins. In Western blot analysis of CTHRC1, a monoclonal antibody designated CH21D7 was able to detect a band of the apparent molecular weight of a full-length CTHRC1 in the human colon adenocarcinoma cell line HT29. This result was confirmed by a double antibody sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (DAS-ELISA) with the monoclonal antibodies CH21D7 and CH24G2, detecting CTHRC1 in HT29 and in the colon adenocarcinoma cell line SW620. Similar experiments were performed with PAb, MAbs, and sFab against NFE2L3. The immunoblot analysis showed that the monoclonal antibody 41HF8 recognised NFE2L3 in HT29, and leukocytes. These results were verified by DAS-ELISA assay using the pairs PAb/sFab E5 and MAb 41HF8/sFab E5. Furthermore, an immunoassay for simultaneous detection of the two cancer biomarkers was developed using a Dissociation-Enhanced Lanthanide Fluorescent Immunoassay technology (DELFIA).",

Many patients with CRC may develop liver metastases at some point during the course of their disease [3] . Generally, colorectal cancer does not show any symptoms until advanced stages of the disease. Therefore, early diagnosis is very important to identify adenomatous tissue in pretumoral lesions to remove it before it becomes neoplastic tissue.",

It is highly expressed in cartilage, developing bones, and myofibroblasts during skin wound healing and its expression is increased in fibroblasts and chondrocytic cells in response to TGF-beta family members [13] . CTHRC1 inhibit TGF-beta signalling which can lead to a reduction in collagen type I deposition during vascular remodelling. In addition, it has been shown that CTHRC1 is over-expressed in colorectal cancer [9] [10] [11] . In addition, CTHRC1 is implicated in breast cancer, suggesting that CTHRC1 expression in this type of tumour is associated with cancer tissue invasion and metastasis [14] . In recent studies it was suggested that CTHRC1 inhibition may represent a potential method for decreasing melanoma resistance to conventional chemotherapy [15] .",

The antibodies pairs selected for the assay were chosen to avoid as much background as possible. Chessboard reagent titration experiments were carried out to define optimal assay parameters. The assay was optimised as it was recommended by the Perkin Elmer DELFIA guide. The combination of antibodies pair chosen for the assay were MAbs CH21D7/CH24D7 for CTHRC1 detection and sFab E5/PAb for NFE2L3 detection. The chessboard reagent titrations showed that the optimal concentrations of antibodies were 0.06 \u03bcg/ well MAb of CH21D7 and 0.5 \u03bcg/well of E5 as capture antibodies and a dilution 1:40000 of PAb and 1:500 of CH24D7 as detection antibodies. Washing condition was optimized to 6 washes after incubation with samples and detection antibodies to reduce background. The shaking speed was optimised to 125 rpm and the incubation time with enhancement solution to 15 min to increase the signal. The CTHRC1 readings were not affected by the presence of the anti-NFE2L3 reagents or NFE2L3 reading by the presence of anti-CTHRC1 reagents.

Already in 2006 [29] , it was demonstrated with the patent EP2177628A2 that the CTHRC1 was related to CRC and could be used as marker for its diagnosis since CTHRC1 was over-expressed in CRC reaching mRNA level of 22-fold compared to normal cells. In another study, it was shown that the CTHRC1 expression was dramatically up-regulated in several cancer types including CRC [30] . In the same way, the relation of NFE2L3 to cancer was studied by other investigators, showing that 20 genes, including the gene encoding NFE2L3, were up-regulated in colorectal cancer cells [12] and in adenomas when compared with normal tissues [9] [10] [11] [12] . Based on these investigations, it is clear that the information available indicates that CTHRC1 and NFE2L3 proteins are useful candidates to determine the progress of CRC. For example, in our patent EP2008/010665, we described a method for the diagnosis and/or prognosis of colorectal tumour by NFE2L3 detection [31] .",

Therefore, the purpose of the present study was to select PAb, MAbs, and sFab fragments against CTHRC1 and NFE2L3 proteins and to develop immunoassays for CRC diagnosis. We obtained several specific antibodies against the two biomarkers which were analyzed carefully. However, we concentrated our efforts on analysing CTHRC1 and NFE2L3 in cell lines since they are the most frequently used living systems in research and they can be used as model for biomarker detection [32] [33] [34] .

The CTHRC1 detection in CRC cells was proved by a DAS-ELISA DAS with the MAbs CH21D7 and CH24G2. Also, we were able to detect with the assay the CTHRC1 protein in HT29 and SW620 cell lines, but not in the negative control protein extract. This DAS-ELISA had a sensitivity of 2.0 ng/ml. In the same way, we showed the NFE2L3 protein expression in CRC cells. Several protein bands were detected by Western blot in CRC cell lines, leukocytes and lymphocytes corresponding to the molecular weight of 44-, 65-, and 77 kDa. The protein band pattern obtained in our result was formed probably due the processing of the native protein. In theory, the expected molecular weight of NFE2L3 should be 76.1 kDa according to Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 3 from UniProtKB at http:// [37] . In addition of the bands mentioned above, their work showed two smaller bands, hypothesizing that they are created through either translation from two internal start codons at Met173 and Met211 or from the proteolytic cleavage occurring within a central region [37] . The native NFE2L3 detection was confirmed by DAS-ELISA with PAb, MAbs, and sFabs against NFE2L3 in CRC cells and leukocytes. Also, we were able to detect with this DAS-ELISA the NFE2L3 protein in HT29 and SW620 cell lines, but not in the negative control protein extract. The assays sensitivities were 0.5 -5.0 ng/ml.",

We were able to combine the antibodies pairs of two developed colorimetric DAS-ELISA to one DELFIA assay without disturbing each other in the measurement. When the two colorimetric DAS-ELISA were converted to DELFIA assays for single measurement, the sensitivity was increase to 3-fold. When two individual DELFIA assays were combined, the sensitivity decreased to range of the colorimetric DAS-ELISA. We were able to develop an assay to detect the two biomarkers simultaneously. The DELFIA assay was successfully developed. Even, when the sensitivity was not improved in this case with DELFIA several advantages have been incorporated to the original DAS-ELISA with this technology. Some of these advantages can be useful in medical diagnostic including cost-, time-, and samples-reduction and signal stability. The sensitivity of our DELFIA assay is in the process to be improved by replacing the pre-labelled secondary antibodies with primary lanthanide-labelled antibodies. It will be interesting to test our antibodies and assays with other biological samples than cell lines such as serum or tissues from CRC patients. In a first effort to optimize the assay conditions for serum analysis with our assays, it was performed spike-in experiments with negative serum to determine if serum component can affect the detection level of CTHRC1 and NFE2L3. The diagnostic/prognostic in the serum of patients can be limited by the presence of highly abundant albumin and immunoglobulins that constitute approximately 60-97% of the total serum proteins [38] or by other components. However, in our study we were not able to see any differences between the detection with and without serum, indicating that measurement of our biomarkers is unaffected by highly abundant proteins in serum (data not shown). We are in the process to improve the assay sensitivity and performance by labelling the PAb, MAb CH24D7 and MAb 41HF8 directly with Samarium and Europium. An additional application of our DELFIA CTHRC1 NFE2L3 assay may be mass screening of therapeutic compounds relating to CRC.",
