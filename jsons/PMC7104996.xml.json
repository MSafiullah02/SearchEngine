Rising consumer incomes, changes in lifestyle and demographics, and shifting preferences due to advanced knowledge about the relationship between food and health contribute to new demands for foods (Dolgopolova, Teuber, & Bruschi, 2015). Today, foods are intended to not only satisfy hunger and provide necessary nutrients, but also to prevent nutrition-related diseases and improve physical and mental well-being (Annunziata & Vecchio, 2011): functional foods could play an important role in human health. Underutilised fruits, as serviceberry, could be an important source of health promoting phytonutrients with medicinal properties. Furthermore, these fruits have often high pigment contents, which could represent an alternative to synthetic dyes (Rymbai et al., 2016).",

Serviceberry is native to North America from Alaska, across western Canada, and in the western and north-central USA (Lim, 2012). It is less known and rarely grown in Europe (except Scandinavian countries) in spite of its high frost resistance, decorative value as a shrub, and edible fruits (Bakowska-Barczak, Marianchuk, & Kolodziejczyk, 2007). In its native environment, serviceberry is found in thickets, woodland margins, banks of streams, canyons, and hillsides, from sea level to 3000 m altitude. It prefers a rich, well-drained loamy soil but it can also grow in any sandy or clayey soil that is not waterlogged or too dry. It is relatively drought and salt tolerant and thrives in a sunny or semi-shade position (Lim, 2012).",

It has a variable habitus but it is usually found as a multi-stemmed shrub ranging from 2\u20133 m in height: some genotypes are cultivated for commercial fruit production in western USA and Canada. Its fruits are approximately 1 cm in diameter, blue-purple and ripen in July (Hu, Kwok, & Kitts, 2005). A. arborea (Downy serviceberry) is an eastern North American large shrub or small tree 8\u201310 m high and is crossed with A. laevis to produce cultivars for the landscape industry in the USA. The fruits of A. arborea are purple-black, slightly sweet and ripen in late June (Adhikari, Francis, Schutzki, Chandra, & Nair, 2005). A. canadensis (Shadblow serviceberry) is another eastern North American species. It ripens in early June and it is used in the landscape trade. It is a stoloniferous shrub or small tree reaching 8 m in height with a fastigiate crown and smooth ash-grey bark. Twigs are slender, reddish-brown becoming glabrous during flowering, while leaves are alternate, simple, oval-obovate to nearly round. The maroon-purple fruits are similar to A. arborea ones (pome, 7\u201315 mm across, glabrous, wax-coated) (Lim, 2012).",

The fruits are also been added into cider, wine, beer, or tea (Adhikari et al, 2005, Bakowska-Barczak, Kolodziejczyk, 2008). The native people and early settlers of the North American prairies used serviceberry as one of their main food sources, but its use was limited because of its natural distribution area in the wild. In the last two decades, however, there has been growing interest in the industrial cultivation and utilisation of this fruit in Canada and USA (Michigan) (Adhikari et al, 2005, Kershaw, 2000). Fruit processing has an important role in exploiting the raw material because serviceberry has a relatively short harvest period (Michalczyk & Macura, 2010). Innovative methods of processing, freezing, and packaging have greatly increased the uses of this fruit. Moreover, growers are promoting it as a potential functional food (Jamin, 2009), alongside other fruit species, as Ribes nigrum (Donno et al., 2013b), Morus nigra (Donno, Cerutti, Prgomet, Mellano, & Beccaro, 2015c) and Lycium spp. (Donno, Beccaro, Mellano, Cerutti, & Bounous, 2015a).",

The cultivated serviceberry fruit size is on average greater than the size of the fruit harvested in the wild, as reported in the previous studies (Bakowska-Barczak, Kolodziejczyk, 2008, Cazares-Franco et al, 2014). The results (Table 3) corroborated with Stushnoff (1991), who reported that cultivated serviceberry showed up to 25% larger fruit size compared with wild fruit one. Quality analysis reported a mean value of TSS 21.90 \u00b1 2.89 \u00b0Brix, TA 68.82 \u00b1 7.37 meq \u22c5 L\u22121 and pH 3.42 \u00b1 0.02 (Table 3). The TSS in various serviceberry genotypes ranged from 20% to 30% FW, with 16\u201323% sucrose and 8\u201312% reducing sugars (Mazza, 1982). Wolfe and Wood (1971) found that the sugar content slowly increased as the fruit matured and then considerably accelerated before ripening: fructose content greatly decreased (\u221225%) after the fruit ripened while the glucose content remained unaltered. The pH of wild fruits, as reported in previous studies (Cazares-Franco et al, 2014, Lim, 2012), is often lower than the pH of cultivated fruits: the higher pH indicates that the cultivated fruit is a low-acid food, a positive sensory feature, as confirmed by TA values reported in this study. Moreover, a lower TSS/TA ratio than other berry fruits, mainly due to the low fruit acidity, provides a longer shelf life (Galletta, Ballinger, Monroe, & Kushman, 1971).",

            "text": "Studies by Hosseinian and Beta (2007) showed that serviceberry had high potential value for the fresh market and food-derived manufacturers, because of their high polyphenolic content, in particular, anthocyanins. The TPC (539.24 \u00b1 29.20 mgGAE/100gFW) and TAC (220.66 \u00b1 17.43 mgC3G/100gFW) values obtained from the analysed extracts are reported in Table 4\n. Anthocyanins and total phenolics in serviceberries increase with fruit ripening (Lim, 2012). The phenolic compounds found in fruits and vegetables have attracted much interest due to their beneficial properties (Faller & Fialho, 2010). Based on the TPC, serviceberry fruits are excellent polyphenolic sources compared with commonly consumed fruits. For example, TPC reported for some berries (e.g. raspberry, blueberry, strawberry, and blackcurrant) (Donno et al, 2013b, Donno et al, 2015c) were markedly lower than TPC reported in this study for serviceberry. Moreover, a high positive correlation between TPC and antioxidant capacity has been established (Donno et al, 2012, Faller, Fialho, 2010): therefore, A. canadensis is a very attractive fruit species from a functional point of view. In other studies (Lim, 2012), anthocyanin content was correlated with TPC, TA, pH, and sugar : acid ratio. The results in Table 3, Table 4 suggested that high content of anthocyanins in serviceberries could be associated with high TPC and low pH and sugar : acid ratio. Hellstr\u00f6m, Sinkkonen, Karonen, and Mattila (2007) found that fruits of different serviceberry genotypes contained proanthocyanidins from dimers to heptamers and higher polymers. In serviceberry, proanthocyanidins were generally of the procyanidin type, mainly consisting of epicatechin units linked by B-type bonds. Bakowska-Barczak et al. (2007) found serviceberries contained the following anthocyanidins: cyanidin, delphinidin, pelargonidin, petunidin, peonidin, and malvidin. In the current research, only TAC was considered.",

In this study, fresh fruits showed a mean FRAP value of 25.07 \u00b1 0.48 mmol Fe2+ \u22c5 kg\u22121 (Table 4). Thus, serviceberry presented a higher FRAP value compared to some common fruit, as black mulberry, goji, raspberry, and apple (Donno et al., 2015c). Antioxidant activity values of the above mentioned common fruits are reported in other studies (Cazares-Franco et al, 2014, Michalczyk, Macura, 2010). On the basis of TAC and TPC measurements, it would appear that the antioxidant properties of serviceberry fruits are mainly affected by anthocyanins (Pearson correlation index for TAC/antioxidant activity presented a value of 0.73).",

            "text": "Evidence continues to emerge suggesting that many commonly consumed fruits and vegetables are beneficial to health in relation to the prevention of several diseases. For this reason, there is a growing interest in novel or less well-known foods that offer an opportunity for health maintenance. This study demonstrated that serviceberry fruits present a plethora of phytochemicals with the capacity to promote health and protect against chronic diseases. The results of this study provided a detailed assessment of the quality, chemical characteristics, and potential of a cultivated edible serviceberry as a functional fresh fruit. Substantial amounts of simple phenolics, as chlorogenic, coumaric and ferulic acids, and flavonols are present in this fruit. Some of these simple phenolics, together with complex polyphenols, monoterpenes and other phytochemicals (organic acids and vitamin C) make serviceberry an alternative fruit that could contribute to the prevention of chronic diseases resulting from oxidative stress. Finally, as the opportunity for medium-scale production on marginal lands, further studies are needed to investigate this genotype by environment interactions and identify several genotypes suitable for fresh consumption, processing, or breeding research.",
