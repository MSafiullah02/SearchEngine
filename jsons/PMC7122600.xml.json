            "text": "The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) occurred in southern China in November 2002. The causative agent was a novel coronavirus originating from wild animals in a live market [see reviews in (1,2)]. From November 2002 to July 2003, a cumulative total of more than 8098 probable SARS cases with more than 774 deaths were reported in 26 countries (http://www.wpro.who.int/sars/). However, after the epidemic appeared to be over, a laboratory-acquired SARS outbreak occurred in China in late March and mid-April, 2004, with one fatality. Although the outbreak was finally contained, the biosafety procedure in the laboratory conducting SARS research with live virus was cause for serious concern (http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/sars/sarsprepplan.html). Thus, these cases from China highlighted the risk of SARS transmission from laboratory-acquired infection and were a good reminder of the need to handle infectious SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) with great care.",

We have demonstrated that subcutaneously administered UV-inactivated SARS-CoV elicits a high level of IgG-type neutralizing antibodies and weak T-cell responses in mice (4). A whole virion is also useful, and sometimes necessary, for the analysis of immune response in vaccinated animals. Using UV-inactivated SARS-CoV, we established several monoclonal antibodies that recognize the spike (S) or nucleocapsid (N) proteins (5), which is quite useful not only for basic research but also for the clinical diagnosis of SARS-CoV infection. Here we describe our protocol for the large-scale preparation of UV-inactivated SARS-CoV virion under the strict Biosafety Level 3 (BSL3) regulation.",

Basically, any liquid waste is sterilized by the autoclave of the BSL laboratory liquid-waste-treating system and drained into a storage tank for secondary decontamination.Personal protective equipment (PPE) comprises disposable gloves, particulate filter masks, arm covers, closed-toed footwear, foot covers, and head coverings in addition to solid-front gowns and ethanol spray.

However, the yield of cell-free virus is good enough [personal communication with Dr. Shigeru Morikawa (the First Department of Virology, National Institute of Infectious Diseases (NIID), Tokyo)].Select a container for UV irradiation of a total of 400 ml supernatant; the liquid should be less than 2.5 cm high to ensure inactivation of the virus.Alternatively, we know that UV irradiation of purified virions (0.5 ml, >109 PFU) plated in a Falcon dish (\u03c635 mm) for 10 min using UVP Model UVG-11 (4-W UV-lamp, 254-nm wavelength; 1520 \u03bcW/cm2) completely eliminates viral infectivity (600 mJ/cm2 at 254 nm).When the loss of infectivity of purified virion is confirmed by TCID assay, one can handle UV-inactivated virion at BSL2. In order to increase the safety of this UV-inactivated SARS-CoV, we inactivated the virion vaccine using both UV and formalin. The purified UV-inactivated virion was treated with formalin at a final concentration of 0.002% and left in a safety cabinet overnight to allow the formalin to evaporate naturally. Then, in order to avoid any risk of residual formalin, virion was diluted 20-fold with PBS and concentrated in the presence of 0.5% \u03b2-cyclodextrin using a centrifugal concentrator (see below). This doubly inactivated SARS-CoV vaccine elicited comparable immune responses with UV-inactivated SARS-CoV vaccine in mice (6).To concentrate purified virions or recombinant N protein, a centrifugal concentrator was used. However, we realized that more than 90% of virion or recombinant N protein was lost during this procedure. This is probably due to the sticky nature of viral proteins on the filter membrane. We tested blocking reagents of membrane filter and found that \u03b2-cyclodextrin worked quite well.\n",
