            "text": "Proteins are the main source of drug targets and some of them possess therapeutic potential themselves. Among them, membrane proteins constitute approximately 50% of the major drug targets. In the drug discovery pipeline, rapid methods for producing different classes of proteins in a simple manner with high quality are important for structural and functional analysis. Cell-free systems are emerging as an attractive alternative for the production of proteins due to their flexible nature without any cell membrane constraints. In a bioproduction context, open systems based on cell lysates derived from different sources, and with batch-to-batch consistency, have acted as a catalyst for cell-free synthesis of target proteins. Most importantly, proteins can be processed for downstream applications like purification and functional analysis without the necessity of transfection, selection, and expansion of clones. In the last 5 years, there has been an increased availability of new cell-free lysates derived from multiple organisms, and their use for the synthesis of a diverse range of proteins. Despite this progress, major challenges still exist in terms of scalability, cost effectiveness, protein folding, and functionality. In this review, we present an overview of different cell-free systems derived from diverse sources and their application in the production of a wide spectrum of proteins. Further, this article discusses some recent progress in cell-free systems derived from Chinese hamster ovary and Sf21 lysates containing endogenous translocationally active microsomes for the synthesis of membrane proteins. We particularly highlight the usage of internal ribosomal entry site sequences for more efficient protein production, and also the significance of site-specific incorporation of non-canonical amino acids for labeling applications and creation of antibody drug conjugates using cell-free systems. We also discuss strategies to overcome the major challenges involved in commercializing cell-free platforms from a laboratory level for future drug development.",

When it comes to drug discovery, proteins are key components as they can have therapeutic potential themselves (e.g., antibodies, coagulation factors, hormones, growth factors, enzymes, and antimicrobial peptides), but also because they could serve as drug targets for diverse diseases (as ion channels, receptors, enzymes, and transporters, for example) [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] . A large proportion of approved pharmaceutical drugs target human proteins. Beyond that, protein-based therapeutics, such as antibody-drug conjugates, represent a significant percentage of total drug molecules currently approved. They are poised to grow further with increased gene expression technology, improved protein engineering, and refined bioinformatics tools. Some proteins are very difficult to express in traditional cell-based systems and this can hamper our ability to define the mechanism of action and structure-function relationship of the individual protein, knowledge which aids the development of drugs targeting these proteins [1] [2] [3] [4] .",

Traditionally, Escherichia coli-based systems were widely used for the production of recombinant proteins due to simplicity in preparation and operation, and cost effectiveness. As a result, broad research and standardization from several years was performed using E. coli-based expression systems, resulting in their often-cited utilization as a state-of-the-art protein expression system [8] . For complex therapeutic proteins, membrane proteins (MPs) originating from humans, and virus-like proteins (VLPs), mammalian expression systems fulfill all the requirements like post-translational modifications (PTMs), cofactors, and chaperones for correct folding and efficient production. However, batch-tobatch variation in cell culture may be a source of process variation. Additionally, overexpression of MPs might be toxic for the cultivated cells, resulting in cell death or truncated and misfolded proteins [9] .",

New expression technologies where proteins can be expressed in a simple way and which allow high throughput screening of different reaction conditions, different genes, and different supplements in a cost-effective manner are extremely important for future drug development. In this review, we give an overview of recent advances in cell-free (CF) synthesis platforms and their diverse applications.

These cell extracts can be stored at \u2212 80 \u00b0C for years and can be used by thawing just before the reaction. Such extracts contain all the principal components necessary for transcription and translation, such as aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (AAS), ribosomes, and factors necessary for elongation, initiation, and transcription. Protein synthesis can be realized by combining cell extracts with necessary substrates like amino acids, energy substrates, DNA, cofactors, salts, and nucleotides. Depending on the biochemical properties of the protein and its end application, the appropriate CF system can be selected. CFPS is a fast protein production system since it does not require transfection or cell culture and lacks cell viability constraints. Due to its openness, CFPS platforms offer additional advantages when compared with cell-based expression methods. A comparative analysis of CF and cellbased approaches is shown in Table 1 .",

Protein synthesis starts with crude cell extracts prepared from E. coli cells that contain the translation machinery along with all the essential components required for translation. A modified and reconstituted CF synthesis system known as the PURE system (protein synthesis using recombinant elements), where all the components of the translation machinery are purified and added individually along with the DNA template to produce the protein, has been reported [40] . This is a highly controlled system compared with crude extract methods. A major advantage of the PURE system is that protein factors participating in the initiation, elongation, and termination of the protein synthesis process are identified and can be adapted individually to the CF system's requirements. Although the naturally occurring PTM machinery is not available in the E. coli lysates, recently proteins with N-glycosylation were synthesized by using E. coli extracts enriched with glycosylation components, including oligosaccharyltransferases (OSTs) and lipid-linked oligosaccharides (LLOs) [41] . Using release factor (RF1) deficient E. coli lysates, proteins were phosphorylated by incorporation of non-canonical amino acids, which will be addressed in a later part of this review [42] .",

However, these cells have limitations when it comes to difficult-to-express proteins like overexpression of complex MPs, toxic proteins, and multi-subunit proteins as discussed above. CF systems based on CHO lysates are evolving as an alternative strategy for the expression of difficult-to-express proteins [13, [17] [18] [19] 46] . Apart from many general advantages of CF systems, CHO-based CF systems retain most of the features of CHO cells while being more flexible due to the lack of cell membrane boundaries. CHO-based lysates harbor endogenous microsomal vesicles enabling translocation of transmembrane proteins and secretory proteins. Furthermore, PTMs of de novo synthesized MPs, such as glycosylation, are possible using CHO lysate. Thus, using CHO cell lysate for CFPS has a potential value and enables new opportunities, in particular, the high-yield production of pharmaceutically relevant MPs [13, [17] [18] [19] . There is a significant increase in the number of publications based on CHO lysates for CFPS. Table 2 compares different CF systems and their advantages and limitations with some selected examples.

This method is relatively fast and cheap, and synthesis can be performed within 1.5-3 hours depending on the system. E. coli-based systems can provide protein yields ranging from 100 \u00b5g/ mL to 2-3 mg/mL. Although the yields from batch-based eukaryotic systems are comparatively low, MPs are automatically incorporated into microsomal membranes and the functionality can be addressed immediately after the synthesis [62] . For researchers who would like to further scale up the protein yields via batch-based eukaryotic systems, a repetitive batch-based synthesis format has been proposed where the microsomes incorporating the MP of interest generated in an initial synthesis reaction can be added to a fresh CF synthesis reaction that has been depleted of its microsomes [19, 45] . Another popular CF synthesis format that has been used for a rapid increase in the protein yields is the so-called continuous exchange cell-free synthesis platform (CECF). In this format, a semi-permeable dialysis membrane separates the reaction chamber and a feed chamber and thereby a feed chamber provides the fresh reaction components and enriches the reaction chamber. In exchange, the inhibitory components accumulated during the reaction are removed [14, 17, 18, 46] . Typically, the CECF format prolongs the reaction time and increases the protein yields. Until now, the CECF format has been used to increase the protein yield by multiple fold, and is widely used as CF platforms (Table 2 ).",

            "text": "Designing synthetic DNA and sequence manipulation for CF synthesis by adding regulatory elements plays a significant role in high-yield protein production. In eukaryotic CF systems, initiation factors (IFs) in particular limit the initiation of protein synthesis, thereby leading to low protein yields. One alternative is to use internal ribosome entry site (IRES) elements found in the 5\u2032-untranslated region (5\u2032UTR) of the different viral genomes upstream of the start codon for cap-independent translation initiation [14, 18, 62] . IRES elements from three different viral sources were compared for their translational efficiency in Sf21, CHO, and human leukemia K562 CF lysates. The IRES from the cricket paralysis virus (CrPV) typically increased protein yields by a factor of 3-5 [62] . Inserting the CrPV-IRES into the corresponding vector upstream of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene, and using the CECF reaction format, EGFR yields were significantly increased to more than 100-fold compared with batch reaction format without CrPV-IRES [14] . Additionally, replacement of the initiator codon (ATG) to a GCU-codon in combination with the CrPV-IRES resulted in a further improvement of protein expression levels in CHO and K562 CF systems [62] . The vector backbone also plays an important role in CFPS. A detailed study comparing commercially available vectors harboring the luciferase gene in combination with CrPV-IRES showed that there is a significant 5-fold increase in protein yield with a change in the vector backbone [19] . Species-independent translational sequences (SITS) are another group of synthetic 5\u2032UTRs capable of initiating cap-independent translation in multiple prokaryotic and eukaryotic CF systems [66] . Typically, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products are generated with SITS downstream of the T7 promoter and upstream of the start codon ATG [66] . The 3\u2032 hairpin region of the SITS increases the residence time of the preinitiation complex in the vicinity of the start codon [66] . Using L. tarentolae CFPS in the presence of genes encoding 58 Rab encoding variable fragments in combination with a universal SITS, nearly a full complement of human Rab GTPases were produced with a yield of around 30 \u00b5g/mL [36] . Similarly, EGFP with a yield of around 300 \u00b5g/mL [66] , and an active multisubunit enzyme heterodimeric farnesyl transferase (FTase) [36] were synthesized using the L. tarentolae CFPS [36] .",

By increasing the temperature from 27 to 30 \u00b0C, the protein yields were increased by almost 50%.

Drugs targeting MPs such as ion channels, transporters, and G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) represent 12 out of the top 20 global revenues in the pharmaceutical industry [3] . Due to the presence of transmembrane domains, ranging from 1 to 24, these proteins are highly hydrophobic and are very challenging to express by traditional cell-based systems. Expression of human proteins in heterologous cellular hosts is very much limited due to the difference in their lipid composition, which can prevent the MPs from attaining maximum functionality [9] . Synthesis of MPs by cell-based methods often leads to cytotoxicity, aggregation, and improper folding [9] . To analyze MP functionality, the protein needs to be folded properly and in the appropriate hydrophobic environment. CF systems derived from prokaryotic, as well as eukaryotic lysates lacking endogenous microsomes, require specific supplements for the solubilization of MPs in the form of detergents, nanodiscs, or liposomes. Non-ionic and zwitterionic detergents are commonly used as supplements in the majority of CFPS reactions for the solubilization of MPs during their production. Detergent-solubilized MPs can be either used directly for functional analysis or may be reconstituted into liposomes by mixing with artificial lipids followed by detergent removal [9, 82, 83] . Alternatively, nanodiscs (NDs) and liposome-based reconstitution are detergent-free strategies where NDs and liposomes, prepared and characterized externally, could be supplemented directly into the reaction mixture for the reconstitution [9, 84] . A detailed review of the CF synthesis of MPs and the usage of solubilization supplements for isolation and functional analysis is presented in the literature [9] . Some of the advantages of NDs are easy purification and flexibility in using different lipids and membrane scaffold proteins for creating different sizes, and their availability as monodisperse and homogenous NDs. Nonetheless, NDs have their limitations, particularly when working with a protein whose functionality depends on its orientation and also working with transporter proteins. Liposome-based reconstitution covers the limitations of the NDs, but the separation of liposomes after the CF reaction is quite challenging and often suffers from disruption due to osmotic instability. Further, such passive reconstitution strategies do not offer the advantages of post-translational modifications within native membranes and are limited for MPs whose function does not depend on active translocon-based translation.",

The involvement of GPCRs in almost all processes in living cells has resulted in significant pharmaceutical interest in this protein class, and the development of robust and high-throughput-suitable assays for the discovery of novel ligands and drugs targeting these proteins. In principle, the screening of ligands can be performed in whole-cell assays by measuring a downstream signaling event, or in CF assays, which are decoupled from the living organism. Usually, these decoupled methods are preferable for high-throughput screenings, as they are easy to handle and therefore amenable for automation and downsizing. These parameters can be well combined with CFPS. An automated CF synthesis procedure for the production of different MPs is already reported [97] . This procedure might be further expanded for the parallel analysis and identification of molecules that target different GPCRs. To date, only a few studies have analyzed in detail the activity of receptors produced by CF systems. The main reason for this is that there are limited well established activity assays. This section addresses possible activity assays that might be transferred to CF systems in the future. Radioligand binding assays, the gold standard for identifying binding molecules, are already adapted for GPCRs that have been synthesized in eukaryotic and prokaryotic CF systems, and demonstrate similar binding affinities in comparison with in vivo produced GPCRs [20, [98] [99] [100] . Alternatively, fluorescently labeled ligands can be analyzed by an optical read-out system using eukaryotic CF systems harboring endogenous membrane structures [101] . Nevertheless, for these systems, radiolabeled or fluorescently labeled ligands are required, thereby limiting the analysis mainly to GPCRs with already known ligands. In addition, simple ligand binding assays usually do not differentiate between an agonistic and an antagonistic effect of the bound substance.",

This method is not yet established in CF systems but might be transferable assuming the presence of G\u03b1 proteins in the eukaryotic lysate. Alternatively, the G\u03b1 proteins can be additionally co-synthesized to the target GPCR or directly applied to the reaction based on the open nature of CF systems.

Different sensor models are known in living cells [103] . The monitoring of intermolecular interactions can be performed as well in CF systems using the already established in vivo models. One model includes the tagging of the C-terminus of a GPCR of interest to a fluorophore (GFP/YFP) and fusing a binding partner such as \u03b2-arrestin to luciferase or a second fluorophore [104] . Upon activation of the GPCR, \u03b2-arrestin binds to the receptor and both tags are in close proximity, resulting in a measurable energy transfer. This model requires active G protein-coupled receptor kinases for the phosphorylation of the C terminus of the synthesized GPCR to get recognized by \u03b2-arrestins. This requirement has to be analyzed in detail in the individual CF systems. The second known in vivo model visualized intramolecular changes after agonist and antagonist binding by introducing fluorophores into the third extracellular loop and the C terminus of different GPCRs. Upon activation, the distance between both fluorophores changes and an alteration in the energy transfer can be measured [105, 106] . Initial experiments to transfer these energy transfer-based sensors were recently performed in CF systems [107] . Both models can be applied to high-throughput analyses. In summary, the successful CF synthesis of a variety of GPCRs has been demonstrated in recent years and a transfer of these GPCR production systems to a drug discovery format in a high-throughput manner has recently started. In the near future, we might see novel technologies for ligand screenings, thereby utilizing the advantage of the automatization and downsizing capacity of CF systems.",

Besides the synthesis of individual antibodies, CF technology can be used to display libraries of antibodies. In contrast to phage and yeast display, in vitro CF systems such as ribosome and mRNA display are open, and thus result in higher library sizes. In theory, the size of the library is only limited by the quantity of supplemented mRNA/DNA, the volume of the CF reaction, and the number of ribosomes within the system, resulting in library sizes of ~ 10 12\u221215 /mL CF reaction [108] . In comparison, phage and yeast display exhibit library diversities of ~ 10 6 -10 10 . Selection technologies such as ribosome display [109] , mRNA display [110] , and CIS display [111] have been developed based on reticulocyte lysate [110] and E. coli CF systems [109] . These systems focused on smaller antibody fragments because their functionality does not rely on the assembly of multiple polypeptide chains. Nonetheless, recently two groups have succeeded in developing completely CF display technologies that allow the selection of Fab fragments [112] . The challenge to assemble the heavy and light polypeptide chain (HC/LC) of the Fab fragment was approached in different ways. While Sumida et al. succeeded by combining mRNA display based on two mRNA sub-libraries, one encoding HC, the other one encoding LC, with in vitro compartmentalization PCR to link and then amplify HC and LC gene pairs [112] , Stafford et al. developed a ribosome display method where they displayed only one of the two Fab chains, while the other one was not presented in display format [113] .",

The site-specific introduction of non-canonical amino acids into a genetically engineered sequence can be used to create site-specifically labeled ADCs [121] . Currently, seven ADCs are approved for therapy. To date, all of these ADCs have been generated by coupling of mAbs to the cytotoxic linker-payload via surface-exposed lysines, or partial disulfide reduction and conjugation to free cysteines, which typically results in a controlled but heterogeneous ADC population with varying numbers and positions of drug molecules attached to the mAb [122] . Homogeneous ADC populations can be achieved by introducing the payload at one or more defined positions. By developing a bioorthogonal tRNA/synthetase pair, Zimmerman et al. have shown that the optimized non-canonical amino acid para-azidomethyll-phenylalanine (pAMF) can be site-specifically incorporated into the tumor-specific, Her2-binding IgG trastuzumab [123] . Subsequently, the cytotoxic linker payload DBCO-PEG-monomethyl auristatin (DBCO-PEG-MMAF) was conjugated to pAMF via strain-promoted azide-alkyne cycloaddition (SPAAC) copper-free click chemistry.",

            "text": "When non-canonical amino acids (ncAAs) are incorporated into proteins, novel functional, structural, and imaging properties can be generated. This synthetic biology application is fast emerging and has wide applications such as incorporating precise PTMs and adding novel functions to proteins [23, 24, 42, 45] . By taking advantage of the openness of the CFPS, one can add the machinery responsible for the co-translational incorporation of ncAAs directly to the standard reaction components. One possible method to incorporate ncAA is to use precharged tRNAs harboring the ncAA. One of the most commonly used methods is the amber suppression technology using an orthogonal pair of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase/tRNA (O-tRNA/aaRS pairs from distinct organisms), which functions independent of endogenous AARSs and tRNAs in the host and is used to direct the incorporation of ncAAs to specific positions such as the amber stop codon (UAG). After incorporation of an ncAA with a reactive group, bioorthogonal click reactions can be performed to conjugate a molecule of interest. The most general biorthogonal click reactions for conjugating molecular probes or polymers are the copper-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC), Staudinger-ligation, photo click cycloaddition, strain-promoted azide-alkyne cycloaddition (SPAAC) and inverse electron-demand Diels-Alder cycloadditions (IEDDA + SPIEDAC). Using E. colibased CF systems, Cui et al. showed the incorporation of two fluorescent labels, BODIPY fluorophore and TAMRA-DIBO, by using a precharged tRNA + orthogonal system for FRET measurements [153] . Using Sf21-based CF systems, Quast et al. demonstrated the incorporation of p-azido-l-phenylalanine at defined amber positions in parallel in the two subunits of the human EGFR protein dimer. Later, the azido group of the incorporated AzFs was coupled by photoaffinity cross-linking using a bis-COMBO linker to create a stable synthetic dimer of EGFR [14] . The dimerized protein shows autophosphorylation in the presence of tyrosine kinase. In general, release factor 1 (RF1) competes with orthogonal ncAA-tRNA for the amber codon, which results in truncated products along with successfully suppressed products. So, CF lysates derived from genetically modified E. coli lacking release factor 1 (RF1) can be used to enhance the incorporation efficiency of ncAAs. Using the orthogonal system and E. coli-based CFPS, human MEK1 kinase with PTMs was synthesized up to milligram quantities by site-specific, co-translational incorporation of phosphoserine at specific positions [154] .",

Prior to full realization of CF systems as emerging tools for drug discovery and evaluation, several factors need to be addressed, like synthesis of the high-quality functional protein with proper folding and PTM, cost of production, scalability, and safety issues. A more detailed understanding of the components in the CF lysates will substantially improve the quality and stability of the extract preparation. The quantity of the protein depends on the translation efficiency of the CF system. The most important factors that influence the protein yields are quality of the celllysate, reaction conditions, and template optimization as addressed in section 3.2. To increase the translation efficiency, further efforts are required to increase the quality of lysate production. This can be achieved by using genetic engineering tools to remove the factors responsible for nucleic acid degradation, ribosome inactivation, and protein degradation. Brodiazhenko et al. showed that genomic disruption of genes encoding ribosome-inactivating factors (HPF in B. subtilis and Stm1 in S. cerevisiae) has improved the activities of bacterial and yeast translation systems [54] . In this context, advanced engineering tools like CRISPR Cas could help to improve the translation efficiency of the CF systems [155] . Activation and enrichment of translation-relevant factors could also increase translation efficiency [63] .",

            "text": "When it comes to eukaryotic CFPS platforms, translocation through microsomes currently remains a black box. Optimizing the efficiency of coupling translation and translocation needs to be addressed. The most important issue with CF systems, especially when working with CECF systems, is to maintain the balance between the amount of protein synthesized and the stability and quality of the protein. Although CECF has been capable of producing 0.6-1 mg protein per mL, especially with the mammalian expression systems, only a small fraction of the produced protein was subject to detailed functional analysis [15, 155] . This is one of the reasons why the functional assays are limited to binding assays (GPCR, TLR, antibody), PLBE (ion channels), and colorimetric assays (enzymes). By optimizing the redox conditions, the problem of Ab translocation into the lumen of microsomes is addressed already [75, 155] . However, when it comes to the synthesis of complex transmembrane proteins in mammalian systems, the insertion efficiency might be already saturated at the low synthesis rates due to restrictions on the level of the translocon's functionality. A more detailed analysis of lipid composition and proteins constituting the microsomes present in the insect, CHO, and human-derived lysates will help to improve the quality of synthesized membrane proteins. One could use alternative supplements like nanodiscs or liposomes reconstituted from microsomal membranes to support MP integration [156] . Intense efforts on designing novel and improved mammalian CF systems should be maintained as the majority of the drug targets are related to complex eukaryotic proteins. Optimizing CF reactions in order to decrease protein aggregation during the purification processes and increasing the quality of the protein purification, especially when using the CECF method, is strongly required.",

Substantial costs arise from the usage of phosphorylated energy systems, cofactors, nucleotides, amino acids, and DNA. Alternative energy regeneration systems are available in the place of phosphorylated substrates (e.g., glucose, maltodextrin, etc.) for sustainable ATP regeneration throughout the synthesis reaction [157] [158] [159] . Use of nucleoside monophosphates instead of nucleoside triphosphates as the nucleotide source in the CF systems could be another cost-effective parameter [159] . Avoiding the use of exogenous tRNAs and cyclic AMPs and reducing the concentration of amino acids and nucleotides are some of the cost-effective parameters one could optimize during protein synthesis. Additionally, new high-cell-density cultivation strategies and improvement in the quality of cell lines by genetic engineering could help to produce cost-effective high-quality CF systems. Costs can also be decreased by engineering and optimization of eukaryotic lysates to extend the lifetime of these systems, thereby increasing the yield of the produced protein.",
