Studies of these strains have elucidated mechanisms of axonal loss and demyelination (3). RSA59 and RSMHV2 both cause hepatitis, encephalitis, and meningitis after intracranial inoculation. However, they differ in their ability to induce macrophage infiltration and subsequent demyelination and axonal loss in spinal cord (2). There is a lack of viral antigen spread and subsequent inflammation extending into spinal cord white matter after intracranial infection with the NDM strain, whereas there is extensive macrophage-mediated white matter pathology secondary to DM strain infection. Thus, the spike protein plays a critical role in anterograde axonal transport of viral particles, an important mechanism mediating axonal damage and demyelination (2, 4). Because both strains cause encephalitis after transcranial inoculation, the differences in spike protein between DM and NDM strains do not impair viral entry; however, differential neural cell tropism may contribute to the mechanism of demyelination (2, 4, 5). Infection of brain neurons and oligodendrocytes occurs on inoculation with either strain, whereas in the spinal cord, oligodendrocyte infection is only seen with the DM strain. This is likely due to the route by which the virus gains access to white matter, that is, spinal cord infection does not occur as a result of direct trauma, whereas transcranial inoculation results in traumatic disruption of the brain gray-white matter interface. Viral particles that would require anterograde axonal transport from infected neurons to reach myelin are able to gain direct access to the myelin sheath and spread proximally to oligodendrocyte cytoplasm.",

Earlier studies suggested that MHV strains may spread via retrograde axonal transport (6, 7), but the molecular mechanisms mediating such transport are not well defined. In the optic nerve, the parental demyelinating strain MHV-A59 causes inflammation, demyelination, and axonal loss (ie, optic neuritis), in contrast to the nondemyelinating MHV-2 strain (8). Whether MHV-induced optic neuritis is dependent on retrograde axonal transport of viral particles or is due to local traumatic disruption of the intracranial portion of retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axons during inoculation is not known. Moreover, the immune response in MHV recombinant strain optic neuritis has not been well characterized. Here, we compared the incidence and phenotype of optic neuritis after inoculation with RSA59 and RSMHV2 and assessed the ability of spike protein to facilitate retrograde axonal transport and induce optic neuritis.",

This suggests that the spike protein may mediate retrograde axonal transport of the virus, allowing it to travel from brain regions containing RGC axonal projections along the optic nerve. Viral antigen was consistently detected within thalamic neurons in RSA59-infected mouse brains (Figs. 5C, D), as well as in some RSMHV2-infected brains (Fig. 5B). RSA59 viral antigen was also detected in the superior colliculi in some animals (data not shown). Light diffuse staining detected in optic nerves from RSA59-infected mice (Fig. 5G), but not RSMHV2-infected mice (Fig. 5F), suggests that only the RSA59 viral antigen is transported to the optic nerves. To further investigate this, the optic nerves were isolated 3 or 6 days pi and frozen sections were examined for the presence of EGFP. Viral antigen-positive EGFP signal was observed in optic nerves from RSA59-infected mice (Figs. 5I, J) but not RSMHV2-infected mice (Fig. 5H). The punctate EGFP signal in optic nerve sections observed by fluorescent microscopy in RSA59-infected mice (Fig. 5J) further suggests axonal transport through the optic nerve and was seen as early as 3 days pi.",

Accordingly, nerves from RSA59-infected mice at the chronic stage showed significantly decreased axonal density compared with nerves from RSMHV2-infected mice. This differential ability of MHV strains to induce optic neuritis and axonal injury is dependent on spike glycoprotein mediated retrograde transport of viral antigen along RGC axons. Prior studies demonstrated that RSA59 and RSMHV2 both can cause meningitis and encephalitis, but RSMHV2 did not induce subsequent demyelination and axonal loss in spinal cord. Our current results demonstrate that in addition to demyelination and axonal loss, RSMHV2 also has limited ability to cause significant optic nerve inflammation and RGC infection. However, RSMHV2 did induce some optic nerve inflammation, unlike the parental strain MHV2. This difference may be due to the ability of RSMHV2 to enter neurons in the brain parenchyma and replicate, as demonstrated previously (2, 4, 5) and shown again here, leading to a higher viral load that may allow some diffusion of the virus at an undetectable level. Alternatively, the higher viral load might trigger a more diffuse central nervous system (CNS) inflammatory response associated with mild, nonspecific inflammation in some optic nerves. MHV2, on the other hand, does not enter the brain parenchyma, and infection with it results in meningitis without inducing encephalitis (3).",

Evaluation of axonal loss and demyelination in the spinal cord demonstrated that DM MHV infection begins in the neuronal cell body, propagates to the axon, and subsequently induces axonal degeneration and demyelination. The propagation of viral antigen from gray to white matter is dependent on anterograde axonal transport of virus particle mediated by the spike protein (2, 4). Spike protein-mediated axonal transport as an underlying mechanism is further supported by the current studies and demonstrates that it also plays a role in mediating retrograde axonal transport. It is especially intriguing that MHV uses similar molecular mechanisms to interact with cellular axonal transport machinery, suggesting that targeted disruption of this protein function might prevent all pathogenic spread of the virus.",

In cultured neurons, viral interaction with the microtubule network in neuronal processes has been shown to be important; based on cross-interaction of antimicrotubule antibodies and the nucleocapsid protein (N), it is possible that such interactions might be involved in axonal transport mechanisms (15).

            "text": "How the DM strain of MHV initially infects neurons requires further study. One possible explanation could be that traumatic disruption to the nerve endings in the brain allows access of the virus through the damaged axolemma; or the virus may be capable of directly infecting intact axons either in the brain, or after diffusing into the optic nerve in the cerebrospinal fluid. Alternatively, virus may be engulfed into the axons at synaptic terminals. Although direct infection after diffusion in cerebrospinal fluid could potentially explain the presence of viral antigen in optic nerves, the fact that antigen is detected in RGC bodies in the retina demonstrates that retrograde transport does occur. Although the presence of viral antigen in RGCs alone cannot exclude hematogenous spread as an alternate mechanism from retrograde transport, the timing of its spread (ie, detected only at day 6 pi in the retina versus day 3 pi within optic nerves and within liver via hematogenous spread), the lack of hematogenous spread to the CNS after systemic infection with equivalent doses of MHV-A59 (6), and the presence of viral antigen in areas of the brain containing RGC projections all suggest that retrograde transport is the more likely mechanism of viral spread. Figure 7 shows a diagram of the optic nerve pathway across which viral antigen is likely transported.",

            "text": "Retrograde transport may follow fusion of the spike protein with axonal membranes followed by loss of most of the viral structural proteins and then binding of the nucleocapsid via one or more viral proteins to the retrograde molecular motors. Such a mechanism has been seen in other neurovirulent viruses that follow a retrograde direction of axonal transport (16, 17). Although it is not common that a single virus can use both directional transport mechanisms, this is not the first virus to demonstrate such properties. For example, herpesviruses can be transported rapidly along microtubules in the retrograde direction from the axon terminus to the dorsal root ganglion and then anterograde in the opposite direction (18, 19). Axonal transport is an important strategy used by several neurovirulent viruses, including herpes simplex, rabies, polio, influenza, and Borna disease viruses, which can be transported in axons either in anterograde or in retrograde direction (20-22). In some instances, viruses can be transported within axons for a long distance, yet this journey occurs within the cell. Therefore, the virus cannot be inactivated by neutralizing antibody during its transit and may spread in the CNS without inducing an antivirus immune response while it is within the cell. When viruses can spread only within axons and/or via direct cell-to-cell contact, they could potentially escape the attack of antiviral drugs or neutralizing antibodies. In the current studies, optic nerve inflammation induced by DM strain RSA59 consisted of predominantly macrophages/microglia, similar to immune responses in spinal cord (2) and without the marked T-cell infiltration seen in other demyelinating disease models (23-26). Iba-1 staining was diffuse and was observed in cell bodies as well as cell processes, as has been seen previously with this macrophage/microglia marker (27, 28). Although Iba-1 cannot distinguish between macrophages and microglia, we suspect most labeled cells represent infiltrating macrophages based on the overall increase in the number of cells observed. Macrophages have been shown to play both proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory roles in optic nerves (29), and we suggest that the DM strain viral antigen might be moving within axons to avoid being cleared by infiltrating macrophages.",

Analyzing the underlying principles of MHV axonal transport will be helpful in the design of viral vectors to be used in research, in human gene therapy, and in the identification of new antiviral therapies.
