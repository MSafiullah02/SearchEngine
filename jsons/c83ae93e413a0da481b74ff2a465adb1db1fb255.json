On the date of this patient's admission an application was made for compassionate-use remdesivir therapy, which was subsequently approved. Remdesivir was initiated on day 5 of this patient's hospitalization, by which time the patient's status had deteriorated and she required mechanical ventilation as described. Following initiation of remdesivir the patient improved relatively quickly and was able to be extubated on day 5 of the 10-day course of remdesivir therapy. The patient was able to be transitioned to room air 24 hours later, and was subsequently discharged on no supplemental oxygen on day 10 of her remdesivir trial. This result is in line with other such case reports of compassionate-use remdesivir, which, while limited in power and uncontrolled, have shown that initiation of remdesivir may reduce time to extubation, increase the rate of extubation, and decrease mortality in COVID-19 patients requiring mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal oxygen therapy [7] . Randomized controlled trials are ongoing and needed to determine the efficacy of remdesivir in the management of critically ill SARS -CoV-2 infected patients, but this case and other limited case series show promise for remdesivir as a viable therapy for COVID-19.",
