The study sample consists of 227 nurses who were available and participated in the research voluntarily during the study. The study data were collected by using \"Nurse Description Form\" and \"Compassion Scale (CS).\" In the analysis of the study data, number, percentage, mean and independent T test and ANOVA test were used. The total mean score of CS of the nurses was found as 97.02 \u00b1 10.67. There was no statistically significant difference between gender, marital status and weekly work hours of the nurses and their total CS score means and total sub-scale score means. On the other hand, there was a statistically significant difference between the age variable of the nurses and the sub-scale of \"separation,\" between the education level of the nurses and their total CS score means. As a result, it was found that the level of compassion of the nurses was moderate and the level of education affected the compassion levels of the nurses.",

According to Gilbert (2005) , the basic feature that distinguishes compassion from other similar concepts such as empathy, sympathy and altruism is that it has the desire to resolve the pain, the cognitive process of understanding the source of pain and the behavioral process related to performing compassionate actions (Gilbert 2005) . At the same time, compassion is formed by a combination of motive, emotion, thought and behavior. In the studies of Sprecher and Fehr (2005) , compassion is conceptualized as compassionate (sensitive) love. Compassionate (sensitive) love is defined as an attitude toward humanity that involves behavior, feeling and thinking that focuses on concern, caring and support for humanity, as well as a motivation to understand and help humanity when they are most in need (\u0130\u015fg\u00f6r 2017b; Akdeniz and Deniz 2016) .",

Self-compassion is defined as the self-attentive and understanding of the individual instead of criticizing himself in pain and failure situations, the understanding that the negative factors experienced by the individual are part of the common experiences of all people and the search for logical solutions rather than overcoming negative feelings and thoughts.",

The scale consists of six sub-dimensions: compassion, negligence, sense of sharing purpose, disconnection, conscious awareness and disengagement. The negligence, disconnection and disengagement sub-dimensions of the scale are measured by reversion method. After this measurement, the average of total score is calculated. As the total score obtained from the scale increases, the compassion level also increases. The Cronbach's alpha value of the scale was found as 0.85 (Akdeniz and Deniz 2016) . In this study, Cronbach's alpha value was calculated as 0.80.",

Considering the highest score that can be taken from the scale, it can be said that the nurses' mercy levels are moderate. In a study conducted by Arl\u0131 and Bakan (2018) in order to determine the compassion level of the surgical nurses, the total average score of the nurses was 96.37 \u00b1 14.35. In a study conducted by \u0130\u015fg\u00f6r (2017a) on university students, the CS total score average of the students was found to be 99.24 \u00b1 11.70. Similar results were found in the study of \u00c7ing\u00f6l et al. (2018) on nursing students. Our study results are similar to the literature. As a result of the study, there was no statistically significant difference between the CS total score averages of the nurses and the average scores of the scale subdimension with gender, marital status and weekly working hours (p > .05). In the study of Arl\u0131 and Bakan (2018) , it was also reported that the gender factor did not affect the level of compassion in nurses. On the other hand, in the studies conducted by Neff and Pommier (2013) , \u00c7ing\u00f6l et al. (2018) , Hac\u0131kele\u015fo\u011flu and Kartopu (2017) , Polat and Erdem (2017) and Salazar (2015) , it was emphasized that gender has a significant impact on the level of compassion. It is thought that the difference between the findings of the other studies and the results of this study may be due to the difference in the number of male and female nurses in the sample group. On the other hand, although the difference is not significant, it is seen that female nurses' compassion levels are higher than male nurses. This finding can be said to be an expected result, and this result has been associated with the emotional structure of females and their maternal spirits.",
