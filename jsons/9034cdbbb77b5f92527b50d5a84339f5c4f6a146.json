We explore the question of whether this represents exponentially decaying dynamics or is simply an artefact of India's testing strategy. Testing has largely been limited to individuals travelling from high-risk countries and their immediate contacts, meaning that the network reflects positive identifications from a biased testing sample. Given generally low levels of testing and an almost complete absence of testing for community spread, there is significant risk that we may be missing out on the actual nature of outbreak. India still has an apparently low current caseload, with possibly a small window of time to act, and should therefore aggressively and systematically expand random testing for community spread, including for asymptomatic cases. This will help understand true transmission characteristics and plan appropriately for the immediate future.",

When 0 > 1, the number of infections grows and spreads in the population, but not for 0 < 1. 0 is generally modelled from data on the spread of the disease, with the assumption that the dynamic of spread is underway in the community and that the measure therefore parametrizes the extent of intra-community spread.",

Using this characterization of individual infections, we create the network of COVID-19 infections in India, and compute the transmission rate as the average number of neighbours of a node in the network.

            "text": "To answer this question, we must first turn our attention to testing processes on the ground to identify cases of COVID-19 in India. It has been widely reported that the testing in India has been focused on (and limited to) citizens who have travelled from a set of high-risk countries and those who have come in contact with these cases [31] [32] . There has been no systematic testing process in place for testing the extent of community spread in India [33] . Given this bias in testing, it should be no surprise that among the observed cases of COVID-19 in the country, a majority are travellers from high-risk countries and their immediate contacts with local transmission (as reflected in the networks structure of infections, Fig. 2b ). Recently the Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR) confirmed that limited testing on community spread had been initiated -1,020 tests of people without travel history or contact with infected persons were to be done, though details of the randomization process in selecting these cases are not available [34] . While this is a start, it must be kept in mind that the actual network of spread will continue to reflect the same bias until community testing becomes a significant part of the testing strategy. Consolidated data from ICMR tells us that India has so far tested a total of 13,486 samples [35] , or 10 tests people per million population, which is very low compared to other countries that have been testing for community spread [36] , and creates the risk of missing such transmission in case it is already underway in the country. India currently has over 200 COVID-19 positive cases, but is yet to hit the kinds of caseload spikes seen in China, the US and Europe [2] . Given this shrinking window of opportunity and the significant lacuna in testing, India must, aggressively and systematically, proceed to widen the scope of testing for possible community transmission immediately. In this context, ICMR has just announced the introduction of tests for asymptomatic direct and high-risk contacts of a confirmed case [37] . However, given the tremendous void in testing for community spread so far, there is a need for larger scale random testing of both symptomatic and asymptomatic cases, in order to better understand the extent of spread in the broader community.",

We computed the transmission rate of the virus, defined as the average number of neighbours of a node in the network (except node 0, which simply stands for infection prior to entering the Indian network), to be 0.43. This is equivalent to the transmission rate of the virus as it is a measure of the average number of infections caused by an infected individual. There appears to be an anomaly here with the revealed transmission rate of 0.43 (< 1) indicating that the spread of the virus should be decreasing, while the data clearly demonstrates that cases are going up from day-to-",
