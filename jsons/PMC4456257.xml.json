This has created challenges in studying the pathogenesis of human-tropic viruses as experiments in NHPs are hampered by logistical, financial, and ethical concerns. This creates a pressing need for more tractable small animal models to study existing and emerging viral diseases. In the last few decades, humanized mice have emerged as a solution to this problem. Humanized mice can be generated by expressing human genes whose products are needed for viral infection (Table 1\n), such as entry factors, or through xenotransplantation of hematopoietic stem cells (creating human immune system mice, known as HIS) and/or other human tissues (Figure 1\n).",

Besides humans, only chimpanzees are readily susceptible to HIV, but since they usually do not progress to AIDS, they have not gained traction as HIV animal models. In searching for alternatives, it was shown that smaller NHPs, specifically rhesus macaques, were susceptible to simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), leading to AIDS-like symptoms. To improve the utility of this model, chimeric viruses closely resembling HIV-1, namely simian-human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV) and simian-tropic HIV (stHIV), were generated [1].",

Advances have been made, but they are primarily focused on establishing HIV uptake in mice [2]. Since HIV is a lymphotropic virus primarily infecting CD4 T cells, engraftment of human immune system components proved a viable approach to establish HIV infections in a small animal model. Early models pioneered by McCune and colleagues, based on engrafting xenorecipients with human fetal thymic or lymph node implants, demonstrated that an acute infection of human lymphoid organs with HIV-1 can be followed in humanized mice [3]. With the improvement of xenorecipient strains and humanization protocols (extensively reviewed in [4]), HIS mice have deepened our knowledge about HIV viral transmission, immune responses to HIV and the efficacy of novel therapeutic interventions. The ability of HIV-1-infected cells to form latent reservoirs has been especially challenging in completely curing individuals of the virus [5]. Recently, several groups have shown that HIV-1 latency can be observed in humanized mouse models [6, 7, 8]. These mice have made it possible to model in vivo, for example, how treatment using broadly neutralizing antibodies in combination with inducers can prevent viral rebound following removal from antiretrovirals [9]. In hindering transmission, vectored immunoprophylaxis has shown promise as a way to obstruct intravenous [10] and mucosal transmission of HIV in humanized mice [11]. As the latter is the primary route by which individuals become infected, the in vivo model for mucosal HIV transmission is physiologically relevant and provides a venue for testing anti-viral therapies. Immune responses in HIS mice are suboptimal because of a variety of incompatibilities between the mouse and human immune system. Nonetheless, it was shown that in a particular version of HIS mice, so-called bone-marrow liver thymus (BLT) mice, the dynamic interplay of HIV-specific cellular immunity and viral escape from immune pressure can be accurately modeled [12\u2022\u2022].",

            "text": "Dengue is a mosquito-borne disease, caused by DENV, a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus belonging to the family Flaviviridae. Four genetically and antigenically distinct serotypes, DENV-1 to DENV-4, have been described, annually causing \u223c390 million infections which range in severity from completely asymptomatic to lethal hemorrhagic fever or shock syndrome (DHF and DSS, respectively) [13]. Since a vaccine still does not exist, studying the immune response to DENV is of especial importance, as individuals with previous immunity are more susceptible to developing DHF and DSS [14, 15]. Murine xenorecipient strains expressing HLA-A2 were injected with human blood-forming stem cells and demonstrated improved immune responses to tissue-culture derived DENV, especially in assessing human T-cell response to DENV during and after acute infection [16]. Additionally, it was shown that viremia can be suppressed by administration of direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) to humanized mice that displayed symptoms similar to those in humans following infection with a clinical DENV isolate [17], paving the way for creating and testing DAAs that could be utilized in treating DENV. However, while priming of DENV-specific B and T cell responses occurs at some level, it is not sufficiently robust in existing models. This poses challenges for untangling the mechanisms of why DHF/DSS is so much higher in individuals with secondary heterologous DENV infections. Further light has also been shed on identifying the cells targeted by DENV. Past research in humanized mice concluded that T cells were not infected by DENV [18, 19], but two groups have recently observed evidence to the contrary [17, 20]. Finally, since DENV is mosquito-borne, understanding transmission from host to vector and vice versa is important for examining viral spread in populations and preventing large-scale outbreaks. Thus, the examination for the first time of the human immune response in humanized mice following DENV infection by mosquito bite is an encouraging step [21].",

Additionally, immune-compromised patients, such as individuals living with AIDS or recent organ transplant recipients, are also at risk for HCMV-mediated disease [31]. CMV is found in numerous species, but the determinants of species tropism are not yet defined. While rodents and other animals have been utilized to study congenital CMV infection via their species-specific virus [32, 33], it is still not possible to specifically model congenital HCMV infection. However, progress is being made \u2014 immunocompromized mice engrafted with human CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells were able for the first time to establish both systemic HCMV infection and also viral latency and reactivation [34]. Even more recently, HCMV infection was established in the human hepatocytes of a human liver chimeric mouse, building toward a resource for in vivo testing of candidate therapies [35].",

HBV transgenic mice have contributed substantially to our understanding of many aspects of HBV biology, immunobiology and pathogenesis (reviewed in [43]).

Most of the commonly used xenorecipients share common features: they are immunodeficient to prevent xenograft rejection and often suffer from an endogenous liver injury to promote hepatocyte proliferation and provide human donor cells a competitive growth advantage over mouse hepatocytes. In 2001, the development of an Alb-uPA/Rag-2 mouse, which could be engrafted with primary human hepatocytes, was successfully infected with HBV [44] and also HCV [45]. To improve robustness and throughput, several other immunodeficient liver injury models, including fumaryl acetoacetate hydrolase deficient mice (FAH\u2212/\u2212 [46]), MUP-uPA [47] and Alb-HSV1-tk [48], have been generated. These mice can be engrafted to very high levels with human hepatocytes and subsequently become susceptible to HBV and HCV infection. Human liver chimeric mice have been critical tools for studying HBV, HCV and HDV infections but also serve as important tools for preclinically assessing the efficacy of novel therapeutics. However, HBV and HCV pathogenesis, human adaptive immune responses and vaccine development can only be studied in a mouse model harboring both a human liver graft and a functional human immune system. Several groups have now reported that dual engraftment of components of a human immune system and a (matching) human liver can be achieved in a single recipient [49, 50]. When infected with HBV [51] or HCV [52], dually engrafted mice indeed mount virus-specific immune responses and develop histopathological features reminiscent of liver disease in humans. However, the difficulties of donor matching for the two tissue compartments, variation in the level of engraftment, the low throughput and the limited functionality of the engrafted human immune system lessen the utility of this model.",

The challenge is to systematically identify and overcome any restrictions to viral growth in murine cells. Both the HBV and HCV life-cycles are blocked at numerous steps. For HCV, the minimal set of human specific entry factors, that is human CD81 and occludin (OCLN) have been identified, facilitating HCV uptake into mouse cells in vitro [53] and in vivo [54]. The entire HCV life-cycle can be recapitulated in mice transgenically expressing human CD81 and OCLN with severely impaired antiviral innate immunity [55\u2022\u2022]. The recent identification of human taurocholate co-transporting polypeptide (hNTCP) as an HBV receptor [56\u2022\u2022] is a promising first step toward creation of a mouse model with inheritable susceptibility to HBV infection. However, it should be noted that there are still numerous blocks to overcome. While HBV assembly and release are supported in mouse hepatocytes, expression of hNTCP does not render mouse cells permissive for HBV uptake, pointing toward post-attachment and post-entry blocks. These include, but are not limited to, the inability of HBV to form covalently closed circular DNA, its main transcriptional template.",
