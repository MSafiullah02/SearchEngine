The prevalence of these diseases is increasing significantly [3\u20136]. Because of the increasing prevalence of these underlying conditions, HRF is a common reason for admission and a frequent co-morbidity among hospitalized patients. Despite this, there are few studies addressing outcomes of this patient population.",

This initial model was winnowed until only predictors achieving a significance level of p < 0.05 remained in a model. All variables either initially excluded or dropped were tested again, one-by-one, in a model with only significant predictors. The linearity of all continuous covariates contributing significantly to the outcome was tested using fractional polynomial regression in STATA 15.1 (StataCorp, College Station, TX). Interactions between significant predictors that remained in a tentative final model were tested.

Active smokers were less likely to be readmitted, but this was not significant in multi-variate regression, suggesting that still smoking was related to some other factor such as perhaps reduced overall level of chronic illness, rather than an independent factor. A diagnosis of peripheral vascular disease identified patients at particularly high risk of readmission in multivariate regression analysis. Peripheral vascular disease has been identified as a risk factor for readmission following catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation [23], percutaneous coronary intervention [24], admission for heart failure [25] and acute hospitalizations in older adults [26], suggesting that peripheral vascular disease may particularly be a marker of chronic illness severity that increases risk of readmission for patients. Another factor that predicted an increased risk of 30-day readmission in this cohort was tachycardia during the first 24 h of the index hospitalization. Tachycardia would appear to be a factor limited to acute illness during the index admission. We are not able to explain why this would predicted subsequent 30-day readmission, but perhaps it is a marker of chronic cardiovascular dysfunction, which might predict increased risk. Identifying these patients as being at high risk of 30-day readmission may be a first step to providing targeted interventions to prevent readmission.",

Use of CPAP or BIPAP did not appear to affect outcomes, but as there were so few participants discharged on these modalities, it is somewhat difficult to interpret these data. Thirty two percent of patients admitted with HRF had comorbid OSA or obesity hypoventilation, indications for ventilatory support, and so there are likely many patients who could have benefited from institution of CPAP, BIPAP or NIV on discharge for these indications. There are also likely to be patients with chronic pulmonary disease that might benefit from ventilatory support: Murphy et al. reported that NIV for patients with persistent hypercapnia and hypoxemia 2\u20134 weeks following hospital discharge significantly reduced the risk of readmission or death at 12 months [27], and Kohnlein et al. reported that an NIV intervention in patients with chronic hypercapnia targeting reduction in \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$${\\text{Pa}}_{{{\\text{CO}}_{2} }}$$\\end{document}PaCO2 significantly reduced 12 month mortality [28]. Some patients with COPD likely have the overlap syndrome (overlap of COPD with OSA), and an observational study by Marin et al. suggested that treatment of such patients with CPAP reduces the risk of death and COPD exacerbation [2]. The data supporting NIV for patients with COPD suggests this intervention is most effective when initiated after the acute exacerbation, so it is possible that many patients were not discharged on CPAP or BIPAP as it was not deemed medically necessary, though such patients should be closely followed up on discharge. Our study suggests that there may be an opportunity to increase the rate of ventilatory support for some patients.",

A number of co-morbidities and factors were more common in those who died, but factors that were independent risk factors for death included age, use of home oxygen, Charlson co-morbidity index, diagnosis of peripheral vascular disease and hospital readmission. Age and hospital readmission are both factors that will obviously increase risk of death. The Charlson co-morbidity index has been designed and validated as a predictor of death [15], and so this was also to be expected. The fact that peripheral vascular disease\u2014a risk factor for 30 day readmission\u2014was also a risk factor for death in patients with HRF was unexpected. We do not know the reason that peripheral vascular disease increases the risk of adverse outcomes related to HRF, though certainly it is a risk factor for readmission related to cardiovascular disease as noted above. It is possible that the combination of vascular insufficiency and respiratory insufficiency is a physiological combination that particularly increases risk of poor outcomes. Another interesting observation was the fact that use of chronic home oxygen was associated with increased risk of death. It is certainly possible that use of home oxygen is a marker of more advanced disease, but it is conceivable that home oxygen in patients with HRF could actually be harmful, as it may mask worsening disease related to hypercapnia, and even exacerbate hypercapnia through worsened ventilation:perfusion matching [29].",

Another limitation is that patients were identified using ICD 10.0 codes for HRF; patients who were misidentified with HRF could have been included, others not identified with HRF would have been missed and not included in our analysis. However, as we reviewed all the medical records and excluded participants we felt had other reasons for HRF (such as cardiac arrest, seizure or neuromuscular disease) or limited life expectancy (related to advanced cancer, or conditions that in the opinion of the investigator would limit life expectancy to less than three months), this should be pertinent to patients suffering with HRF that would otherwise be expected to survive. On review of the electronic record, the authors felt that 80% of the deaths and admissions were definitely or possibly related to hypercapnic respiratory failure.",

Our data suggest that this patient population might require particularly careful follow-up following their index admission with interventions that might reduce the risk of readmission, such as pulmonary rehabilitation. Admission with HRF is a marker of patients at risk of poor outcomes. Certain factors are associated with particularly poor outcomes such as increased age, increased chronic comorbidities, and the presence of peripheral vascular disease. It is notable that use of home oxygen was associated with an increased risk of death\u2014independent of other factors\u2014and that few patients were treated with CPAP or BIPAP and none with NIV: it is possible that oxygen alone may actually be harmful in this patient population.",
