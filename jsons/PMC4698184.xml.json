            "text": "Enteroviruses belong to the largest genera in the Picornaviridae family, one of the most genetically diverse and medically and economically important viruses that are human and animal pathogens (Knowles et al., 2012). The genus Enterovirus is divided into 10 established and 2 proposed species, and among them, at least 7 species infect humans which includes human rhinovirus (HRV) (A\u2013C) and human enteroviruses (A\u2013D) that include enterovirus D68 (EV-D68), and coxsackievirus A and B (CVA and CVB) (Knowles et al., 2012). Viruses in the Enterovirus genus affect millions of people worldwide and cause a wide spectrum of diseases from asymptomatic or mild illnesses to severe illnesses (Tapparel et al., 2012). Although poliovirus (PV) has been nearly eradicated by immunization, non-polio enteroviruses account for more than 85%\u223c95% of aseptic meningitis cases where a specific viral pathogen is identified (Connolly and Hammer, 1990, Sawyer and Rotbart, 2004). EV-D68, originally classified as human rhinovirus (HRV) 87, was first identified in California in 1962, and is biologically more similar to HRV for its acid-lability and the respiratory track as the target tissue than other enteroviruses (Schieble et al., 1967, Tokarz et al., 2012). EV-D68 can cause mild to severe respiratory illness, which includes fever, runny nose, sneezing, cough, body/muscle aches, wheezing and difficulty breathing at all ages, but infants, children and teenagers are particularly susceptible to severe symptoms. EV-D68 infection causes particularly severe infections in children with asthma or other existing respiratory illnesses. Since its first report in 1962, few outbreaks of EV-D68 had occurred. However, several outbreaks of EV-D68 have been reported in the last 3\u20134 years in Europe, Asia and North America. Especially, nationwide outbreak of severe respiratory illness due to EV-D68 infection occurred in the US in 2014 (Ayscue et al., 2014, Imamura and Oshitani, 2015, Messacar et al., 2015, Midgley et al., 2014, Tokarz et al., 2012) where EV-D68 has been detected in specimens from 12 patients who died.",

The ORF is divided into three consecutive regions; processing of the P1 region yields the capsid proteins (VP1-4), while processing of the P2 and P3 regions yields the nonstructural replication proteins 2A-2C and 3A-3D, respectively (Fig. 1\n). The polyprotein is first cleaved by a virus-encoded 2A protease at the VP1-2A junction, and other junction sites are cleaved by 3Cpro to generate mature nonstructural and structural proteins (Fig. 1) (Racaniello, 2007). 3Cpro is a chymotrypsin-like cysteine and also a constituent of the replication complex, and helps evade host immunity by interacting with host factors (Chase and Semler, 2012). Because 3Cpro is functionally and structurally highly conserved among enteroviruses, 3Cpro is an attractive target for discovery of anti-enterovirus small molecule therapeutics (Lu et al., 2011).",

In this study, we evaluated the series of dipeptidyl compounds (Galasiti Kankanamalage et al., 2015, Mandadapu et al., 2013a, Mandadapu et al., 2013b, Mandadapu et al., 2012, Tiew et al., 2011) against the 3Cpro of EV-D68 and HRV. Our results show that dipeptidyl \u03b1-ketoamide compounds have potent antiviral activities against EV-D68 as well as multiple strains of HRV with half-maximum concentration (EC50) in the low nanomolar range. These \u03b1-ketoamide compounds have excellent in vitro safety indices. One of the \u03b1-ketoamide compounds tested in rats was determined to have a favorable oral bioavailability (20%F). Successful development of \u03b1-ketoamide protease inhibitors against hepatitis C virus (Telaprevir and Boceprevir) suggests these \u03b1-ketoamide compounds may have a high potential for further drug development against emerging EV-D68 as well as HRV.",

The replication cycle of enterovirus is initiated by the attachment of a virus particle to a specific receptor on the host cell surface. An example of attachment inhibitors include Pleconaril that binds to a hydrophobic pocket within enterovirus VP1, a major capsid protein, and consequently prevents viral attachment and uncoating. Recent report demonstrated that Pleconaril also inhibited the replication of EV-D68 by binding to the hydrophobic pocket of VP1 (Liu et al., 2015). Pleconaril failed to get FDA approval for use in adults for potential adverse effects but there are several other entry inhibitors such as Pocapavir and Vapendavir that are being evaluated for their efficacy for neonatal sepsis associated with enterovirus infection (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00031512). Inhibitors of replicases, such as RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase inhibitors, have been reported, but the viral 2A or 3Cpro has been more actively used as a target for inhibition (De Palma et al., 2008b). The design of enterovirus 3Cpro inhibitors has primarily utilized the known peptidyl recognition element and various warheads, such as aldehyde and \u03b1-ketoamide, in the case of transition-state analog inhibitors, which interact with the active site cysteine to yield a tetrahedral adduct (Kim et al., 2012, Ramajayam et al., 2011). The warhead can also be a Michael acceptor, such as an \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated ester or vinyl sulfone which, in contrast to aldehydes and \u03b1-ketoamides, reacts with the active site cysteine in a time-dependent manner to form a covalently-bound enzyme-inhibitor adduct (Dragovich et al., 1999, Kuo et al., 2008, Matthews et al., 1999, Patick et al., 1999, Tan et al., 2013). The most extensively studied inhibitors of this class (Michael acceptors) are AG7088 and its variants, which have been shown to be active against various enteroviruses including HRVs (Hung et al., 2011, Matthews et al., 1999, Patick et al., 1999) and EV-D68 (Tan et al., 2013). However, inhibitors of viral proteases haven not yet been licensed for enterovirus infection.",

            "text": "The compounds used in this study belong to a series of dipeptidyl transition state 3Cpro inhibitors and this series was previously reported to have activities against HRVs (Kim et al., 2012). In this study, we have conducted a structure-activity relationship study using the newly generated dipeptidyl derivatives against EV-D68 and HRVs to compare their relative structural requirements for inhibition and determine the potency of the derivatives against these important pathogens. Compound 1, a prototype dipeptidyl aldehyde, was previously reported to have anti-HRV activity (Kim et al., 2012) and was used as a template for structural modification for these new derivatives. Based on the enzyme and cell culture assays, there was no significant difference in the activity of the compounds against 3Cpro of EV-D68 or HRVs, which suggests that the structural requirements for blockage of 3Cpro is similar for EV-D68 or HRVs, although the amino acid homology between 3Cpro of EV-D68 and HRVs is about 50%. This observation may be explained by the overall structural similarity of 3Cpro of EV-D68 and HRVs and the striking similarity in the topography of their active sites determined by X-ray crystallographic studies (Lu et al., 2011). The 3Cpro of EV-D68 and HRVs have similar substrate specificity of a near absolute requirement for Gln residue at P1 and a hydrophobic residue (Leu, Phe) at P2 (Fig. 1). Our structure-activity relationship study also showed that the interchange of Leu and Phe at the P2 position (R1) did not lead to a marked change in activity against 3Cpro of EV-D68 or HRVs. However, the presence of Cha at the P1 position yielded better activity against EV-D68 and HRVs, compared to Leu and Phe. The activity of the compounds did not change upon replacement of hydrogen ion with m-Cl at R2 (cap), suggesting that the presence of the chlorine atom ion at the meta position does not contribute to the binding by interacting with the 3Cpro of EV-D68 or HRVs. In our previous study, the meta-chlorine substituent was found to significantly improve the efficacy as compared to the inhibitor having an unsubstituted phenyl ring against caliciviruses in 3CLpro enzyme and cell based assays (Galasiti Kankanamalage et al., 2015). Interestingly, the \u03b1-ketoamide compounds were consistently more potent than their aldehyde counterparts against EV-D68 and HRVs in both enzyme and cell-based assays and the most potent compounds for both EV-D68 and HRV14 were \u03b1-ketoamide compounds with Cha at R1 and a benzene cap with or without m-Cl (R2), compound 6 and 10. Previously we have reported that \u03b1-ketoamides compounds were less effective than their aldehyde counterparts against 3CLpro of caliciviruses and coronarviruses (Kim et al., 2012, Tiew et al., 2011). The previous and current findings suggest that the choice of warhead that gives a better fit may be different among different viruses encoding 3Cpro or 3CLpro. Further X-ray crystallographic studies may provide a structural basis for our findings. We reported co-crystallization of poliovirus 3Cpro with the bisulfite adduct of compound 1 (Kim et al., 2012, PDB: 4DCD), and Fig. 4 shows the highly conserved active site structure between 4DCD bound with Compound 1 and 3ZV8 (EV-D68 3Cpro) (Fig. 4). The Gln surrogate ring, Leu and carboxybenzyl ring of the compound fit into the S1, S2 and S4 sites, respectively. The cytotoxicity of all tested compounds was minimal at 100 \u03bcM in cells, indicating a good safety margin with therapeutic indices >1000. In addition, compound 10 was also shown to have a good enzyme selectivity against basic serine (trypsin, thrombin) and metallo- (carboxypeptidase A) proteases, as well as serine proteases (\u03b1-chymotrypsin, human neutrophil elastase) (Table 3).",

            "text": "Compound 10 showed most potent antiviral activity against EV-D68 and HRVs, consequently, its pharmacokinetics and oral bioavailability were evaluated in rats. Unfavorable pharmacokinetics and poor oral bioavailability is one of the major challenges in drug development, exemplified by the unsuccessful development of AG7088 which displays poor aqueous solubility and low oral bioavailability (Dragovich et al., 1999). It was developed as a nasal spray, however, further development was stopped after phase II clinical trials. Another irreversible 3Cpro inhibitor, compound 1 entered clinical trials. Compound 1 was found to be highly effective against HRV strains with EC50 < 100 nM and related enteroviruses and, more importantly, it was orally available (Patick et al., 2005), but it was also dropped during phase 1 clinical trial. Compound 10 is shown to have a favorable oral bioavailability in rats with (%F 20), and the plasma drug concentrations remained higher than in vitro EC90 values against EV-D68 for more than 16 h following oral administration using the simple formulation. The oral bioavailability of the structurally-similar aldehyde compounds was also determined. The %F values for the aldehydes were markedly lower (%F \u223c5) with shorter halt-lives in rats, as compared to those of compound 10 (data not shown). Therefore, the \u03b1-ketoamide warhead may contribute to improvement of the oral bioavailability and the PK of these dipeptidyl compounds, as well as the smaller size (<600 MW) of these dipeptidyl compounds compared to the bulkier AG7088. The duration of compound 10 in the rat plasma above the EC90 values for HRV1B or HRV51 following an oral dose of compound 10 mg/kg is calculated to be much shorter than that for EV-D68 due to the lower antiviral activity of compound 10 against HRV1B or HRV51 (about 2-fold) compared to EV-D68 in cell culture. HRV1B and HRV51 are the representative HRV strains for a minor (HRV1B) and major receptor group (HRV51) where a minor HRV serotypes use low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) and a major HRV serotypes (about 90%) use ICAM-1 as a receptor. When we tested compound 10 against other major group HRV strains such as HRV18 and HRV68, the EC50 and EC90 were comparable to those against HRV51 (data not shown).",
