            "text": "confirmed infections. During the first 37 days of epidemics, 694 cases of COVID-19 were reported in the country, with death cases reaching up to 50 deaths during March 31, 2020. An Iraqi family of four who returned from Iran tested positive for the coronavirus in Kirkuk governorate. They were the first Iraqis known to have caught the disease, a day after an Iranian student in the Najaf governorate became Iraq's first confirmed case on February 24, 2020. After two days another 2 tested positives for coronavirus cases in Baghdad were returning from Iran.The Iraqi government, which has already banned all travel from Iran and China, added Italy, Thailand, South Korea, Singapore, and Japan to its travel ban list, nevertheless the returning Iraqicitizens are exempt. The government urged Iraqis to avoid all public gatherings. Gatherings were banned in Iraqi governorates. Schools and universities were shut; the northern Kurdish region and the capital Baghdad canceled all education until after a March 20 holiday (Figure 1). Large numbers of Iraqis, including religious pilgrims and merchants, had been in Qom as the crisis escalated and were gradually brought back by bus and plane to Baghdad, where only small numbers of patients from their communities are being treated in public hospitals. Baghdad, the Arab world's second-most populous capital with 10 million inhabitants, imposed a curfew but the government's social distancing efforts are facing a hurdle, as pilgrims defy restrictions to commemorate the anniversary of the death of revered Shiite Imam Musa al-Kadhim during March 18, 2020. Health authorities have reported 13 deaths and 164 infections in Iraq from the novel coronavirus by that time and reached up to 50 deaths and 694 after 2 weeks. However, many suspect the number of cases could be higher, as fewer than 4,000 people have been tested in a country of 40 million. Iraqis health officials have expressed fear over the impact of a large outbreak in the country, as years of conflict and poor investment have ravaged the country's health system. Iran is the third country with the highest number of reported COVID-19 cases after China, and Italy, up to March 16, 2020, with 14,991 cases, being the first in the Middle East region, and maybe becoming a significant source of imported cases in this area, in countries such as Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan, among others ] 4 [ . A recent study, based on imported cases from Iran, estimated that 18,300 (95% confidence interval: 3770 to 53,470) COVID-19 cases would have had to occur in the country assuming an outbreak duration of 1.5 months [5]. All confirmed cases in Saudi Arabia are imported from Iran and one from Iraq and other cases are close contacts to those confirmed cases. Imported cases from Iran have been diagnosed in Kuwait, Bahrain, Iraq, Oman, Qatar, among other Asiatic countries, but also Georgia, Estonia, Belarus, and even New Zealand [6]. The COVID-19 outbreak in Iraq is still unclear and complex. Iraq authorities imposed a weeklong curfew after the first 10 deaths were recorded in the country, flights were also suspended from airports and several governorates also closed their borders, the schools and universities have suspended the education. The Iraqi's Health Ministry take action to deal with the current SARS-CoV-2 outbreak by opening a new molecular biological laboratory for the COVID-19 testing at Baghdad, Basrah and Erbil governorate which were delivered to Iraq by the Government of the People's Republic of China under the framework of cooperation agreements between the two countries and under supervision of the World Health Organization technical mission. Since the Central Public Health Laboratory was running only 100 detection tests per day, this will contribute significantly to increasing Iraq's diagnostic capabilities for COVID-19 that consider a critical factor in tracking the virus. For the moment of the proofs correction of this article, Iraq reached 2085 confirmed cases from the total of 92061 tested positive cases for COVID-19, with total deaths reaching 93 deaths and the total recovery of 1375 subjects (April 30, 2020).",
