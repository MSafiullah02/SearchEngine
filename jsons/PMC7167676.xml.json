The complex model with an expanded active\u2010site pocket is useful for anti\u2010SARS drug design. The simulations also provide a mechanism of catalytic efficiency regulated by substrate binding and suggest new experiments that may settle the debate on the existence of a catalytic triad in coronavirus cysteine proteinases and related 3C proteinases. In addition, this work suggests that MMDSs are effective in correcting errors of side\u2010chain, main\u2010chain, and loop conformations that result from low\u2010sequence\u2010identity homology modeling.",
