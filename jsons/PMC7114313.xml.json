In 1796, Jenner used an attenuated infectious agent as a vaccine, inoculating with cowpox to protect against smallpox. In the late 19th century, Pasteur pioneered immunization with nonreplicating preparations of pathogens. Pasteur's technique is succinctly summarized as isolate (the causative agent), inactivate, and inject. This technique formed the basis for his effective vaccines against both bacteria (anthrax) and viruses (rabies).",

Some modern vaccines, such as those against rabies and tick-borne encephalitis, still contain entire inactivated pathogens. Others, such as vaccines against tetanus, diphtheria, human papillomavirus, and hepatitis B, contain isolated molecules known to be targets of protective immunity. The most refined modern vaccines are the glycoconjugates, in which oligosaccharide structures specific to bacterial pathogens are conjugated to carriers.",

With the exception of the genetically engineered modification of the polybasic cleavage site in the hemagglutinins of pre-pandemic influenza vaccines [1], the only significant antigen engineering in licensed vaccines consists of denaturation, detoxification, conjugation, and mixture with or adsorption to adjuvants. Vaccine antigens are not generally engineered using modern genetic techniques and the best available structural data. One exception is a genetically detoxified pertussis toxin [2] that was used as an acellular pertussis vaccine (alone or in combination with diphtheria and tetanus antigens) for several years in Europe. This modification was guided by the structures of the homologous toxins of Pseudomonas aeruginosa\n[3] and the diphtheria corynephage [4].",

One of these characteristics is a lack of highly expressed surface antigens that are suitable for use as vaccine components. For some complex pathogens, the harnessing of genomics through reverse vaccinology is overcoming that barrier. In reverse vaccinology, whole genome sequences of bacteria, fungi, and parasites are mined to discover new protective determinants that were not previously known to be targets of natural immunity [6]. Recombinant expression of these molecules can overcome the low natural abundance that, in many cases, prevented recognition of their potential as vaccine antigens. By increasing the set of native antigens from which to choose, this technique is enabling the development of a new generation of vaccines. The technique has led to the discovery of new protective antigens for pneumococcus [7] and group B streptococcus [8].

Furthermore, the immune response against the determinants of certain viral agents, such as respiratory syncytial virus or dengue virus, can actually exacerbate disease 12, 13. Protecting against new targets faces practical challenges as well. In the impoverished settings where new vaccines are urgently needed, the cost of production and distribution of vaccines is a major barrier to use. Even in the developed world, where expense is less of an issue, the number of immunizations a child receives is becoming increasingly burdensome.",

One important goal of structural vaccinology is to selectively present the conserved determinants of complex and variable antigens. Distinguishing structural components that elicit protective and disease-enhancing immunity could avoid vaccine-mediated exacerbation of disease. Using high resolution structures, antigens can be designed to be more efficiently produced and stably stored than native molecules, thereby lowering costs and eliminating barriers to distribution. By engineering antigens amenable for use in combination vaccines, immunization regimens can be simplified. By knowing which parts of an antigen must be retained to preserve basic characteristics and which can be altered, vaccine antigens can be modified more rapidly in response to changing epidemiology.",

This is because a neutralizing antibody may trap a flexible peptide in a conformation that matches the surface of an intact protein. However, upon immunization with the peptide, any B cell that bears an immunoglobulin that recognizes one of the many conformations of the peptide can be stimulated to expand. With peptide immunization, there is no mechanism to selectively activate only those B cells bearing immunoglobulins that bind both the flexible peptide and the complete, folded antigen. Furthermore, the flexible peptide could guide the affinity maturation of antibodies down many alternative paths, not only those that also optimize binding to the pathogen surface. Reliable affinity maturation of antibodies that efficiently recognize a specific surface requires an immunogen that stably presents that surface rather than transiently writhes through a state resembling the desired target epitope.",

Sequence analysis of viral variants that escape neutralization by monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) identifies those residues that, when altered, prevent antibody binding. Escape mutant analysis is particularly useful for RNA viruses and retroviruses, whose error-prone polymerases lead to high mutation rates and the efficient generation of variants that are no longer neutralized by antibodies. In general, when antibody binding sites are also delineated by physical methods, antibody neutralization escape mutations are found to be located within antibody binding sites 15, 16, 17. A key limitation of escape mutant analysis is that only those mutations that are compatible with viral replication can be identified. This limitation can be overcome by the targeted mutagenesis of recombinant viral antigens followed by directly assaying antibody binding. However, failure of antibodies to bind antigens that have undergone targeted mutagenesis must be interpreted carefully \u2013 mutations may prevent antibody binding by yielding mis-folded domains rather than by falling within the antibody binding site. Screening phage display libraries for neutralizing antibody binding [18] provides an efficient screen of many sequences. However, the utility of phage display is limited by the inability of the relatively short peptides displayed in most libraries to reproduce conformational epitopes. Deuterium exchange mass spectrometry [19] and (for bacterially expressed antigens with high solubility) nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy [20] can identify antibody bound residues in an intact protein.",

For example, the prefusion conformation of influenza HA has been stabilized by tethering the three heads of the HA trimer together through engineered inter-subunit cross links [32]. Similarly, the prefusion state of the measles virus F glycoprotein has been stabilized by a disulfide cross-link that was introduced between the top of the coiled-coil and the base of the head of an adjacent subunit [33]. The effects of such modifications on immunogenicity are yet to be determined. Other types of mutations that favor a preferred conformation include those that reinforce or disrupt hydrophobic cores, hydrogen bond networks, or salt bridges, as has been demonstrated in studies of other paramyxovirus F glycoproteins 30, 34. In theory, engineered mutations could also stabilize other more transient protein conformations, such as those that a fusion protein passes through during the transition between the more stable pre- and post-fusion conformations. Stabilizing transient intermediates could allow the induction of antibodies against conserved epitopes that are exposed too transiently in native molecules to elicit protective antibodies efficiently [35].",

During cell entry, VP7 must be shed from the virion, a process termed uncoating [38]. Rotavirus virions uncoat in vitro when calcium is removed by chelation [39]. Uncoating is caused by the dissociation of calcium-dependent VP7 trimers [40]. Neutralizing antibodies inactivate rotavirus by binding specifically to VP7 trimers on the virion, stabilizing them, and preventing uncoating, even in the presence of a calcium chelator [41]. Therefore, VP7 trimers engineered for enhanced stability could more effectively elicit neutralizing antibodies than native VP7, which is in a dynamic equilibrium between monomers and trimers in solution [42]. In this case, a high resolution structural understanding of a neutralization mechanism could guide the engineering of an optimized antigen.",

Studies of the immune response to immunization with the vesicular stomatitis virus G glycoprotein indicate that the more repetitively and rigidly the G glycoprotein is arrayed, the more immunogenic it becomes [53]. In another example, although the isolated body domain of rotavirus VP4 [49] is a poor immunogen, it can elicit high titer neutralizing antibodies when linked in a stably trimeric form ([23] and unpublished observations).

Such platforms could include self-oligomerizing proteins that form multivalent particles used for human immunization, such as human papillomavirus VP1 [54] and hepatitis B virus surface antigen [55]. Other strategies to enhance the immunogenicity of antigens include engineering linkages to strong T cell epitopes, as exemplified by glycoconjugate vaccines, in which linkage to proteins that bear T cell epitopes enhances the immunogenicity of bacterial carbohydrate antigens [56]. Linking antigens to B cell epitopes that are recognized by highly prevalent antibodies is another approach to increasing immunogenicity. For example linking domains to tetanus toxoid (against which pre-existing immunity is prevalent as a result of widespread immunization against tetanus) can increase immunogenicity, probably by promoting opsonization [57]. However, in some circumstances, this linkage can also decrease immunogenicity, possibly due to T cell-mediated suppression, masking by pre-existing antibody, or enhanced clearance of immune complexes [57].",

In theory, primary immunization with antigens presenting epitopes that have been engineered to bind a prevalent germline antibody could efficiently promote clonal expansion.

Some characteristics certainly disfavor antibody binding. For example, modifying the HIV gp120 surface by adding glycosylation sites masks epitopes on the altered surfaces [63]. More generally, glycosylation can lead to tolerance, because glycans on viruses replicating in a host are generally recognized as \u2018self.\u2019 This is the most likely explanation for the immunological \u2018silence\u2019 of the most heavily glycosylated face of HIV gp120 [27]. A role for glycosylation in evading immunity in previously exposed or immunized hosts is suggested by the evolution of H3 subtype influenza hemagglutinins since H3N2 strains emerged as human pathogens in 1968. Since then, the number of glycans has progressively increased, particularly on the membrane distal part of the HA1 fragment, where most neutralizing antibodies bind [64]. Analogously, it might be possible to abrogate the immunodominance of variable regions by adding masking oligosaccharides to these regions [63]. Conversely, determining which glycans are important for protein folding and solubility, and which glycans mask epitopes but have no essential structural role could allow elimination of masking glycans to enhance the presentation of conserved neutralizing epitopes 65, 66, 67.",

A major challenge is to set up high throughput in vitro screens for the characteristics that are relevant to immunogen performance in vivo.

Motions and alternative packings of flexible elements, such as the cyan foot and stalk domains, drive the rearrangements of the rigid domains.
