In particular, alignment-free sequence analysis and comparison greatly benefited from concepts derived from IT, such as entropy and mutual information. This review covers several aspects of IT applications, ranging from genome global analysis and comparison, including block-entropy estimation and resolution-free metrics based on iterative maps, to local analysis, comprising the classification of motifs, prediction of transcription factor binding sites and sequence characterization based on linguistic complexity and entropic profiles. IT has also been applied to high-level correlations that combine DNA, RNA or protein features with sequence-independent properties, such as gene mapping and phenotype analysis, and has also provided models based on communication systems theory to describe information transmission channels at the cell level and also during evolutionary processes. While not exhaustive, this review attempts to categorize existing methods and to indicate their relation with broader transversal topics such as genomic signatures, data compression and complexity, time series analysis and phylogenetic classification, providing a resource for future developments in this promising area.",

The fundamental theorem of IT states that it is possible to transmit information through a noisy channel (at any rate less than channel capacity) with an arbitrary small probability of error. This was a surprising and counter-intuitive result. The key idea to achieve such transmission is to wait for several blocks of information and use code words, adding redundancy to the transmitted information [3, 4] .",

Therefore, the sections are organized in global analysis and comparison (block-entropy estimation and resolution-free metrics based on iterative maps), local analysis (classification of motifs, prediction of transcription factor binding sites and sequence characterization based on linguistic complexity and entropic profiles), high-level associations merging DNA, RNA or proteins with sequence-independent properties.

The key idea of the information-based similarity index is to compare L-mer ranks of two sequences weighted by the relative Shannon entropy, which corresponds to a weighted city-block dissimilarity on the rankorder. Zipf and redundancy analysis using rank distributions had already discriminated between coding and noncoding regions [83] . Zipf's approach is based on calculating the histograms of word occurrences in linguistic texts and ranking them from most to less frequent. One remarkable feature in natural languages is the Zipf's law, where a linear relation of this function in double logarithmic scale is found. The results obtained by Mantegna and colleagues [83] show that, by applying Zipf's regression, noncoding regions are closer to natural languages in terms of regression parameters and exhibit more redundancy than coding regions, as measured by block entropies. The application to SARS coronavirus illustrates the potential of combining IT and rank-order statistics for genomic analysis.",

If the two are independent, the mutual information is zero and no information is conveyed by a given SNP for that condition. The method allowed estimation of positions (locus) with the highest mutual information for parkinsonism and schizophrenia [132] , and also identification of regions associated with Graves autoimmune disease [133] by correcting finite sample problems and estimating statistical significance through Gamma distribution approximations. Further applications include the detection of gene-gene and gene-environmental interactions in complex diseases, a method with promising results in evaluating bladder cancer data [134] .",

Overall, complexities of hubs and/or bottleneck proteins were shown to have lower complexity, which seems to have relevant evolutionary explanations. This fact also illustrates the cross analysis between the global entropic properties of biological sequences and their correlation with their node function in the PPI network.",

In fact, several models for information transmission have appeared in the literature. Briefly, these are constituted by a source, an encoder, a message that goes through a (noisy) channel, a decoder and a receiver. Gatlin proposed a simple model where a given source transmits DNA sequences, the channel corresponds to transcription and translation and the received message is the amino acid protein sequence [8] . Since then, several other models have been proposed by Yockey [137] , Roman-Roldan [13] and May, who reviewed this area [138, 139] . Other proposed channels including mutations (substitutions, insertions and deletions) were also analyzed in terms of their capacities [140] .",
