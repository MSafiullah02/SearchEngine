            "text": "Outdoor spaces are considered vital constituents of urban environments because they can host entertainment activities that are fundamental to the character of a city and the quality of life of city residents (Chen & Ng, 2012). In particular, outdoor human comfort is extremely important in city planning because it can not only improve the physical and mental health of city residents, but also can help reduce power consumption in residential buildings (Amindeldar, Heidari, & Khalili, 2017; Chatzidimitriou & Yannas, 2016; Elnabawi, Hamza, & Dudek, 2016; Kong et al., 2017; Li, Huang, Wu, & Xu, 2018). Actually, an enjoyable outdoor thermal comfort can encourage city residents to spend more time in outdoor spaces (Chen & Ng, 2012; Du, Mak, Huang, & Niu, 2017). However, congested airflow at the pedestrian level has become a major concern in the high-density cities because it is the driving force for the transfer of pollutant, heat, and water vapour (Ai & Mak, 2015; Chatzidimitriou & Yannas, 2017; Ignatius, Wong, & Jusuf, 2015). This problem is more serious in densely built cities at low or mid latitudes, such as Hong Kong and Singapore, which suffer from urban heat island and global warming (Du, Mak, Kwok et al., 2017; Kong et al., 2017; Ng, 2009; O\u2019Malley, Piroozfar, Farr, & Pomponi, 2015; Yang, Wong, & Jusuf, 2013). Therefore, improving pedestrian level wind environment in high-density cities has become a pressing issue for the establishment of comfortable, healthy, and sustainable cities.",

            "text": "A strong relationship between low wind velocity environments at pedestrian level and unfavourable outdoor living environments has been widely identified in high-density cities (Ignatius et al., 2015). For sub-tropical and densely built cities, such as Hong Kong, the wind speed and radiant temperature are the most influencing factors of pedestrian thermal comfort in hot and humid summers (Niu et al., 2015). In particular, Cheng, Ng, Chan, and Givoni (2012) reported that even in shaded environments, the thermal sensation of respondents was not neutral when wind velocity was below 0.9 m/s during the hot and humid summer of Hong Kong. The cooling effect of wind flow can contribute to the reduction of heat stress in urban cities (Memon, Leung, & Liu, 2010; Priyadarsini, Hien, & Wai David, 2008; Yang & Li, 2011). It was identified that a wind speed of 1 m/s to 1.5 m/s could lower the air temperature by nearly 2 \u00b0C (Erell, Pearlmutter, & Williamson, 2012). Thus, low wind velocity environment has a negative effect on outdoor thermal comfort, particularly in hot and humid summers. In addition, the dispersion and dilution of airborne pollutants in the urban environment depend strongly on wind flow because it can help remove pollutants to external surroundings (Ai & Mak, 2014a,b, 2016; Hang & Li, 2011; Kim & Baik, 2004; N\u2019riain, Fisher, Martin, & Littler, 1998). The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Hong Kong urged the officials and city residents to consider the pollutant dispersion in their living environment (Li, Duan, Yu, & Wong, 2005). By analysing the results from field measurements, Jones, Fisher, Gonzalez-Flesca, and Sokhi (2000) indicated that traffic pollutants could not be properly dispersed or diluted with weak wind conditions in urban areas. Moreover, low wind velocity environments in the street canyons could not form the coupling process to remove the pollutants from the street canyons to the upper atmosphere (Jones et al., 2000; Vignati, Berkowicz, & Hertel, 1996).",

            "text": "There have been a substantial investigations into the improvement of pedestrian level wind environment in the past few decades (Blocken, Stathopoulos, & van Beeck, 2016; Du, Mak, Huang et al., 2017, 2017c; Hang, Sandberg, & Li, 2009; Hang, Li, Sandberg, Buccolieri, & Di Sabatino, 2012; Kubota, Miura, Tominaga, & Mochida, 2008; Liu, Niu, & Xia, 2016; Mirzaei & Haghighat, 2010). Tsang, Kwok, and Hitchcock, (2012) conducted wind tunnel tests to investigate the influence of building dimensions, separations, and podiums on pedestrian level wind environment. Their results indicated that wide buildings with podiums should be discouraged in building designs in high-rise cities, for resulting in large areas of low wind velocity environment around buildings. In the study of Kubota et al. (2008), the relationship between the gross building coverage ratio and the wind environment at pedestrian level from actual Japanese city was quantitatively studied using wind tunnel tests. The results showed that a small gross coverage ratio should be adopted in city planning because a high gross coverage ratio results in low wind velocity at pedestrian level, especially for the detached houses. Niu et al. (2015) conducted field measurements in a university campus in Hong Kong, and their findings indicated that local wind amplification could be achieved by utilising an innovative building design (lift-up design). Hang, Li, Sandberg et al. (2012) numerically studied the wind environment in idealized high-rise urban areas, and reported that building height variation could improve pedestrian level wind environment. Apart from the above mentioned measures, the Hong Kong government has issued the air ventilation assessment (AVA) scheme to enhance wind flow movement at pedestrian level (Ng, 2009). Later, new wind comfort criteria were proposed by Du, Mak, Kwok et al. (2017), which were aimed at assessing wind comfort in low wind velocity environments. However, no general framework that provides detailed application procedure has been presented. Therefore, a general framework that can be applied to improve pedestrian level wind environment is in urgent needed.",

A case study of the Hong Kong Polytechnic University (HKPolyU) campus model was used to elaborate this framework and demonstrate its performance. The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: Section 2 describes the general design framework for improving the low wind velocity environment and describes its detailed guidelines. Sections 3 and 4 summarise the evaluation criteria and improvement measures. The performance of the design framework was investigated with a case study of HKPolyU campus, which is presented in Section 5. Concluding remarks are given in Section 6.",

            "text": "This section describes the design framework and guidelines in detail. Note that the present study only concerns the improvement of low wind velocity environments in high-density cities. However, the general framework developed in this study can also be used to mitigate the nuisance caused by strong wind conditions. In doing so, the improvement measures and evaluation criteria need to be re-determined. A flow chart of the design framework for improving the pedestrian level low wind velocity environment in a high-density city is shown in Fig. 1\n. Meanwhile, the basic parameters for the design framework are summarized in Fig. 2\n. Based on Fig. 1, Fig. 2, the detailed guidelines for the improvement of pedestrian level low wind velocity environment are presented as follows:\u2022Step 1: basic information on the target area should be collected before evaluating the wind environment at pedestrian level. This includes the target area, surrounding area, local wind climate, building information, and geomorphological information. It is well known that urban wind flow is very complex and is closely related to the urban morphology, especially in high-density cities. Thus, for scaled models, accurate reproduction of the buildings and geomorphological features of the target area are very important. These geometric data can be obtained from GIS or government departments. Moreover, the target area should include surrounding buildings and infrastructure, which have a significant impact on the pedestrian level wind environment in the target area. Furthermore, the local wind climate should be acquired from nearby weather stations.\u2022Step 2: based on the obtained basic information, the wind environment at pedestrian level can be obtained by field measurements (Jones et al., 2000; Niu et al., 2015), wind tunnel tests (Du, Mak, Huang et al., 2017; Kubota et al., 2008; Tsang et al., 2012) or computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations (Blocken, Janssen, & van Hooff, 2012, 2016; Du, Mak, Liu et al., 2017; Du, Mak, & Ai, 2018; Tominaga, Mochida, Murakami, & Sawaki, 2008). The field measurements should be conducted for a long time due to the uncertainty and unsteadiness of meteorological conditions (Schatzmann & Leitl, 2011; Schatzmann, Rafailidis, & Pavageau, 1997). Moreover, the building models in the wind tunnel tests or CFD simulations should be replicated as close to the real buildings as possible. In addition, the prediction process should rigorously follow the practice guidelines and regulations, such as the AWES and ASCE quality assurance for wind tunnel (ASCE, 1999; AWES, 2001) and COST and AIJ guidelines for CFD simulation (Franke, 2007; Tominaga, Mochida, Yoshie et al., 2008).\u2022Step 3: the low wind velocity area that needs to be improved can be determined by combining the prediction results obtained in Step 2 and the evaluation criteria. The main features of the evaluation criteria and parameters for improving low wind velocity environments are summarized in Section 3.\u2022Step 4: the low wind velocity environment can be improved by adopting improvement measures such as using the lift-up design to create a void space underneath the building (Du, Mak, Liu et al., 2017; Niu et al., 2015) or adopting openings in building design to guide wind flow through buildings (Fan, Chau, Chan, & Jia, 2017; Yuan & Ng, 2012). The main findings of previous studies on improving weak wind environment by adopting innovative building designs are detailed reviewed in Section 4.\u2022Step 5: the pedestrian level wind environment should be re-evaluated after adopting improvement measures. If the improved wind environment meets the requirements of the evaluation criteria, the wind environment in the target area is then viewed as an acceptable wind environment. Otherwise, new improvement measures should be adopted in the target area as illustrated in Fig. 1.\n",

Additionally, the new wind comfort criteria are established seasonally in consideration of the subtropical weather conditions in Hong Kong. A low wind threshold parameter from AVA scheme was adopted for hot season criteria. Moreover, the parameters in the new wind comfort criteria were chosen by thoroughly reviewing the existing wind comfort criteria to adapt to low wind conditions. Similar to the indicators in the AVA, the mean wind velocity ratio (MVR) and overall mean wind velocity ratio (OMVR) were utilised as indicators in the new wind comfort criteria. These two indicators are defined as follows:(1)MVRi=MVpi/MVr\n(2)OMVR=\u2211i=1nPi\u00d7MVRihere, i is the approaching wind direction; MVpi is the mean wind velocity at any area of pedestrian level when the approaching wind direction is i ; MVr is the mean wind velocity at a reference height (200 m in the prototype) when the approaching wind comes from i direction; and Pi is the occurrence probability of approaching wind coming from i direction.",

They reported a clear correlation between wind speed enhancement and the implementation of lift-up design, and suggested that it was necessary to adopt lift-up design in urban planning and architectural design. A field measurement study in the HKPolyU campus found that wind speed was amplified by the lift-up design in a local precinct (Niu et al., 2015). Xia, Liu, Niu, and Kwok, (2015) assessed the influence of the lift-up design on the pedestrian level wind environment using wind tunnel measurement, and found that integrating the lift-up design in existing building configurations can enhance the wind speed around buildings. In a study of Du, Mak, Liu et al. (2017), the effects of the lift-up design on pedestrian level wind environment in different building configurations, namely the slab shaped building, the corner shaped building, the semi-open shaped building and the close shaped buildings, were quantitatively evaluated using CFD simulation. The results showed that the lift-up design could effectively improve the low wind velocity environment and its enhancement highly relied on the approaching wind direction. Tse et al. (2017) found that the lift-up core dimensions govern the pedestrian level wind speed around an isolated building using wind tunnel measurement, and suggested that proper core dimensions should be selected before implementing the lift-up design in architectural design. Similarly, Du, Mak, and Li (2018) proposed a multi-variable optimization method to determine the appropriate lift-up dimensions for an optimum wind environment at pedestrian level using CFD simulation. Liu et al. (2016, 2017) studied the pedestrian level wind environment around isolated buildings with and without the lift-up design using CFD simulation, and found that the lift-up design could improve the wind speed around isolated buildings, but the effects were only limited to the neighbouring area. The above mentioned studies confirm that the lift-up design is a promising solution for low wind velocity environments in densely built urban areas, especially at pedestrian level.",

Their study also suggested that a higher pedestrian level wind velocity could be achieved when the opening was closer to the ground level and when the size of the opening was larger. In a study conducted by Fan et al. (2017), different types of building openings inside canyons were investigated using CFD simulation. The study concluded that building openings could effectively improve the low wind velocity environment, and considering the values in the development floor area, an opening value of 10% was enough to improve the low wind velocity environment. Moreover, the CFD simulation studies by Hang and Li (2010a), Hang and Li (2011) indicated that the airflow ventilation rate could be improved significantly when buildings in a compact array were open-based (have openings underneath the building).

The basic idea of this system was that it induced airflows from the roof of the building through ventilation ducts to pedestrian level in the street canyon. The performance of the ventilation system under different atmospheric conditions was numerically studied using CFD simulations of stable, neutral, and unstable conditions. Additionally, different ventilation strategies had been proposed for the ventilation system. Their investigation results indicated the application feasibility of the pedestrian level ventilation system. More detailed information on this active pedestrian ventilation system can be found in the studies of Mirzaei and Haghighat (2010); Mirzaei and Haghighat (2011).",

However, this improvement measure may lead to low land use efficiency and it is impractical for the existing urban areas. (ii) The arcade design and the lift-up design can enhance wind ventilation at pedestrian level directly without sacrificing any land use, but the result of the arcade design is less effective than the lift-up design. (iii) The position and size of the building opening can affect the effectiveness of the improvement. (iv) The active strategy of the pedestrian level ventilation system is more controllable than the above passive building design, but it requires energy consumption. Thus, the passive strategy should be preferred over active strategy for the sustainability of city development.",

The scaled ratio for the campus model with its surroundings was 1:200, and the campus model was reproduced in great detail (see Fig. 6\n(a)). 16 wind directions were measured during the wind tunnel tests at an interval of 22.5\u00b0 from 0\u00b0 (North) to 360\u00b0. A reference sensor was located at 1 m high (200 m in full-scale) above the edge of the turn table on the windward side. The approaching wind profiles were acquired by grouping and fitting from previous topographic study, which could represent local wind conditions in real life. The measured and target values of the wind profiles and their corresponding approaching wind directions are presented in Fig. 6(b), where the mean wind velocity at the reference height (200 m in prototype) was around 8 m/s. The measured errors were within 5%, which confirmed the confidence in the measurement data. The similarity requirements were strictly examined during the wind tunnel tests, and the blockage ratio was 4.5% with Reynolds Numbers (Re) over 7\u00d7104. These met the requirements of the quality wind tunnel test standards ASCE (1999) and AWES (2001) manuals). The Kanomax velocity sensors were utilised for the measurements of pedestrian level wind environment, and they were evenly distributed in the campus model. Moreover, the Kanomax velocity sensors were carefully calibrated before the wind tunnel measurements.",

The results of OMVR in three cases are given in Fig. 14\n. It can be seen that when the campus had no improvement measures (preliminary case), nearly 80% of OMVR values were below 0.3, which meant that nearly 80% of the areas in the campus had unfavourable wind comfort. After adopting lift-up design in the campus, the values of OMVR had been greatly improved. However, half of the OMVR values were still below 0.3. Nevertheless, by adding opening in Y building, the values of OMVR were further improved and more than half of the OMVR values were over 0.3. This suggested that more than half of the areas in the campus had acceptable wind comfort.",

The general design framework was presented in the form of a flowchart, which was systematic and effective. Evaluation criteria that aim to improve the low wind velocity environment were also reviewed in detail, namely the AVA scheme, the new wind comfort criteria for Hong Kong, and city ventilation parameters. Moreover, the strategies used to improve low wind velocity environments were reviewed in detail, including the lift-up design, the arcade design, the building opening, building disposition, and the active pedestrian ventilation system.",

The wind comfort of the campus model was improved by vigorously following the proposed design framework, and the improvement measures were chosen based on the review results presented in Section 4. Specifically, three distinctive cases were examined, namely the campus model without the lift-up design, the campus model with the lift-up design, and the campus model with an opening in building Y.

However, this design framework can also be applied to other wind environments, such as strong wind conditions in sparsely populated cities. This can be achieved by replacing the improvement measures and evaluation criteria with the current measures and criteria. Moreover, this study indicated that favourable wind environments in local precincts could be achieved by integrating innovative building designs.",
