Traditional detection methods for virus detection rely on often slow, laborious and insensitive cell culturing, which has now been largely replaced by nucleic acid amplification tests. PCR is usually carried out as a single test for each pathogen and tests for all pathogens are not always available at the same site. Screening clinical samples by sample type/syndrome based multiplex real time PCR would allow for rapid detection of a variety of pathogens simultaneously, which will in turn aid in the treatment and clinical management of the patient.",

When compared to the Abbott system the in house may be slightly less sensitive at the endpoint of detection. The in-house assay therefore may occasionally miss very weak positive C. trachomatis samples. Multiplexing the five assays had no effect on the performance of any of the individual components by assessment of dilution panels.

This ensures more samples can be tested within the working day (Gunson et al., 2008). Since the introduction of the real-time PCR multiplex in 2007 the turn around time (per sample) has reduced from an average of 4.5\u20132 working days (Table 5\n). In addition the percentage of positive samples also increased since this time. The reason for this increase in detection rate is unclear. It may indicate better sampling by clinicians or could be due to the implementation of the new C. trachomatis real time PCR method.",

For example, HSV may result in keratoconjunctivitis that is indistinguishable from adenovirus and is the leading cause of viral-induced blindness in the western world. In addition multiplex PCR allows the screening of both viral and bacterial causes of conjunctivitis which can be important as an individual may have to stay off work/school for up to 2 weeks if the infection is viral, whereas in the case of a bacterial infection, such as C. trachomatis, they could return to work/school 24\u201348 hours after initiating antibiotic treatment.",
