Diagnostic guidelines were proposed by the Histiocyte Society in 199114 and updated in 2004 (panel 2\n).15 Since therapy can be life saving and some of the clinical criteria occur late in disease, it is not necessary to fulfil all criteria before initiating therapy. Main symptoms of haemophagocytic syndrome are fever and splenomegaly. Jaundice, hepatomegaly, lymphadenopathy, rash, and neurological signs are also common (table 1\n). The hallmark laboratory finding is cytopenia, which can be profound. There is also marked liver dysfunction; an elevated ferritin level is characteristic (table 2\n). Two highly diagnostic parameters are an increased plasma concentration of the alpha chain of the interleukin-2 receptor (sCD25) and impaired NK-cell activity. The elevation of interleukin-2 receptor in haemophagocytic syndrome suggests the activation of T lymphocytes and correlates with prognosis.16\nPanel 2Diagnostic guidelines for haemophagocytic syndromeThe diagnosis of haemophagocytic syndrome is established by fulfilling one of the following criteria:\n1A molecular diagnosis consistent with haemophagocytic syndrome (eg, PRF mutations, SAP mutations, MUNC13-4 mutations)2Having five out of eight of the following\n\u2022Fever\u2022Splenomegaly\u2022Cytopenia (affecting more than two cell lineages, haemoglobin \u22649g/dL, <100 000 platelets per \u03bcL, neutrophils <1000 cells per \u03bcL)\u2022Hypertriglyceridaemia (triglycerides \u2265265 mg/dL) and/or hypofibrinogenaemia (fibrinogen \u2264150mg/dL)\u2022Haemophagocytosis in the bone marrow, spleen, or lymph nodes without evidence of malignancy\u2022Low or absent natural killer cell cytotoxicity\u2022Hyperferritinaemia (ferritin \u2265500 ng/mL)\u2022Elevated soluble CD25 (interleukin-2R\u03b1 chain \u22652400 IU/mL)\n\nAdapted from reference 15.",

Treatment differs in children and adults and depends on the underlying disease, the presence of a trigger, and the severity of symptoms.

The resulting persistence of H5-bearing cells leads to a marked lymphoproliferation and interferon-\u03b3 hyperproduction with macrophage overactivation.59 Since mortality caused by H5N1-associated haemophagocytic syndrome is high (around 50%) and antiviral drugs can be ineffective, some authors suggest treatment with a modified HLH-94 protocol60 with a shorter course of etoposide and dexamethasone.
