The key enzyme in the processing of polyproteins translated by the viral RNA genome of SARS-CoV is a 33 kDa protease called 3C-like protease (3CL protease). SARS 3CL protease is a cysteine protease containing a Cys-His catalytic dyad. It cleaves precursor polyproteins at as many as 11 conserved sites involving a conserved Gln at the P1 position and a small amino acid (Ser, Ala, or Gly) at the P\u20321 position. Due to its functional importance in the viral life cycle, SARS 3CL protease is considered to be an attractive target for drug design to treat SARS.",

To develop non-peptidyl small molecular inhibitors of the SARS 3CL protease focusing on the P1, P2 and P4 site interactions, we aimed to design and synthesize serine derivatives having the essential functional groups and evaluated their inhibitory activity in the present study.

            "text": "To determine whether a series of serine derivatives could adopt an energetically favorable conformation mimicking a tetrapeptide inhibitor (1), we performed a variety of molecular mechanics calculations with SPARTAN from Wavefunction and docking simulations of protein interactions by GOLD from CCDC. Firstly, imidazole, cyclohexyl and hydroxy groups, which were optimized functionalities with potent biological activities in the previous literature, were connected with l-serine to design the serine derivative (2a,b) as shown in Scheme 1\n. However, it did not give good coverage of the substrate-recognition pocket of 3CL protease (PDB code 3AW1), that is, the interactions with optimized motifs and the corresponding pockets were different by binding mode, contrary to expectations. The cyclohexyl group of serine derivative (2) occupied the S1 pocket of the 3CL protease imperatively. Thus, the imidazole and hydroxy groups of serine derivative (2) expected for the interactions with the S1 and S4 pockets were not effective and consequently the numbers of interaction atom pairs between the inhibitor (2) and SARS-CoV 3CL protease were diminished. In contrast, Bai21 reported that the cinnamoyl derivatives inhibited SARS-CoV 3CL protease. In this case, the Bai\u2019s inhibitor locates deep insides of the S\u20321, S1 and S2 pockets with appropriate cinnamoyl functionalities. This result was approximately identified with the Bai\u2019s simulation employed by the AutoDock 3.0 estimated free energy of binding for the docking of the Bai\u2019s inhibitor to the SARS 3CL protease (PDB code 1UJ1). Therefore, we examined molecular docking of the serine derivatives contained together with benzoyl and aniline moieties to give 2c, which was an attractive ligand for the 3CL protease. Furthermore, we investigated a reasonable structure for the inhibitor and mode hybrid compounds with Bai\u2019s and our functionalities on the serine derivative (3). As a result, we concluded that reasonable structures are N-cinnamoyl derivatives with benzoate for the side chain on virtual screening by GOLD. Compound 3 has the following characteristics: (a) since the substrates by nature have involved small amino acids (Ser, Ala or Gly) at the P\u20321 position, it may be preferable to adopt the aromatic rings. (b) The proper placement of the cyclohexyl ring may be the result of development of a serine type inhibitor with functionality of the P1 position, as well as stability of interaction of other positions. (c) The S4 pocket is rather hydrophobic in nature and therefore the corresponding side chains, namely aromatic, hydrocarbon or neutral functionalities, make good contact with target regions. (d) Additionally, the region adjacent to the ester bond of 3 is catalytic thiol functionality (Cys145) of the enzyme (Scheme 1).",

To evaluate inhibitory activity of the serine derivative (3) against SARS-CoV 3CL protease, a structure activity relationship study using the serine derivatives was attempted. As depicted in Scheme 2\n, the serine derivatives attached with three functionalities were prepared. Each coupling partner to introduce the functionalities is shown in Table 1, Table 2, Table 3\n. Coupling of Fmoc-l-Ser(tBu)-OH and amines as a P1 moiety with WSC/HOBt followed by the deprotection of Fmoc group by 20% piperidine/DMF gave the serine amide derivative (4) at acceptable chemical yields. The P4 moiety was introduced by coupling with carboxylic acid in the presence of coupling reagents or acylation using carboxylic anhydride or acyl chloride to afford diamide derivatives. Subsequently, treatment of TFA for the deprotection of the t-butyl group gave alcohol (5) at moderate yields. Finally, the esterification of a hydroxy group of 5 with a variety of acyl reagents was performed to give novel serine derivatives (6, 7 and 8) for evaluation of the small molecular inhibitors against SARS 3CL protease. Purification of all crude compounds was performed by silica gel column chromatography. The chemical structures for synthetic compounds were mainly determined by 1H and 13C NMRs, IR and mass spectra (Scheme 2).",

Since the IC50 value of a previous reported peptide aldehyde (1) was reported to be 98 nM, imidazole of histidine or \u03b3-lactam of pyroglutamic acid were important functionalities. However 6a and 6b that had been coupled with 5a and His or pGlu showed low inhibitory activities as expected from the docking simulations (entries 2 and 3). For optimization of the P\u20321 functional group of 6, different acyl units; alkyl, phenyl and pyridyl groups, were examined. Aliphatic groups-containing compounds (6c), (6g) and (6h) showed lower inhibitory activities than 3 (entries 4, 8 and 9). Pyridyl derivatives (6e), (6j) and (6k) were also similar (entries 6, 11 and 12). Aromatic rings with nitro, chloride and methoxy groups (6f), (6i) and (6l) gave moderate results (entries 7, 10 and 13). Phenylacetate (6d) also showed lower inhibitory activity than 3 (entry 5). In contrast, conversion of the phenylpropionate or cinnnamoyl groups at a P\u20321 site would be expected to have a dramatic effect on inhibitory activity. Especially, the cinnamoyl compound (6n) showed potent inhibitory activity at an IC50 value of 85 \u03bcM (entry 16). In addition, a 2-methyl-6-nitrophenyl derivative (6o) showed good potential as a 3CL protease inhibitor (entry 17). The IC50 value of saturated compound (6m) was decreased in comparison with those of the fixed unsaturated derivative (6n) (entry 15). These results suggest that serine type derivatives containing optimized functionalities would be useful as 3CL protease inhibitors. As the correlations between IC50 and C\n log \nP, we could assume that 3, 6m, 6n and 6o with potent inhibitory activities tend relatively to have high lipophilicity with the C\n log \nP values of 4.82\u20135.28 (Table 4).",

E-64, miraziridine A28 and tokaramide A29 were reasonable inhibitors to bind the active site of cathepsin B. For this reason, the inhibitors of SARS 3CL protease are thought to show specificity against endogenous protease. Therefore, we attempted to evaluate the inhibitory activity of the serine derivatives against cathepsin B. The inhibitory activity toward cathepsin B was determined with an assay using a Z-Arg-Arg-MCA substrate developed by Hiwasa et al.30, 31 The inhibition potency of serine derivatives was screened for cathepsin B inhibition at 1.0 mM concentration and subsequently, the IC50 values were determined only for the selected compounds.

Comparing IC50 values against SARS 3CL protease and cathepsin B, it was strongly suggested that the inhibitory activity is attributable mainly to the ester site of 7f.32 The results are consistent with the structural data on 7f in a complex with cathepsin B, which suggests that the P1 site of 7f can easily adopt a conformation that is similar to the binding mode of E-64d. Although the P2 site had a rather weak effect compared with the P1 site, the inhibitory activity of 7f was about 10 times that of 3. To estimate the inhibitory mechanism, an inhibitory kinetics experiment with 7f was performed by making a Lineweaver\u2013Burk plot. The rate of cleavage for different amounts of substrate by cathepsin B in the absence or presence of 7f (100, 500 \u03bcM) was monitored using Fluorescence spectrometer and consequently competitive inhibition toward cathepsin B was assessed.",

Consequently, two attractive inhibitors, ent-3 (SK23) and ent-7k (SK69), which were derived from the tetrapeptide aldehyde (1) and Bai\u2019s inhibitor were produced. These inhibitors showed protease selectivity and no cytotoxicity and therefore a useful methodology using a serine template will facilitate drug design. Especially, we testified that ent-3 (SK23) derived from the virtual screening was most reasonable inhibitor. To improve the inhibitory activity against the SARS 3CL protease, molecular design and evaluation are now underway.",
