SARS was characterized by high infectivity, morbidity and mortality, and the confined pattern of the disease spreading among the countries of South-East and East Asia suggested the existence of susceptible factor(s) in these populations. Studies in the populations of Hong Kong and Taiwan showed an association of human leucocyte antigen (HLA) polymorphisms with the development and/or severity of SARS, respectively. The aim of the present study was to define the genotypic patterns of HLA-A, -B and -DRB1 loci in SARS patients and a co-resident population of Guangdong province, southern China, where the first SARS case was reported. The samples comprised 95 cases of recovered SARS patients and 403 unrelated healthy controls. HLA -A, -B and -DRB1 alleles were genotyped using polymerase chain reaction with sequence-specific primers. The severity of the disease was assessed according to the history of lung infiltration, usage of assisted ventilation and occurrence of lymphocytopenia. Although the allelic frequencies of A23, A34, B60, DRB1*12 in the SARS group were slightly higher, and A33, -B58 and -B61 were lower than in the controls, no statistical significance was found when the Pc value was considered.

Antigenic peptides binding to different alleles of HLA molecules vary in their affinity, with the HLA allotype thus affecting the host immune response to a given antigen.

Hypothetical SARSassociated HLA alleles among the three populations are listed in Table 4 , and it is obvious that the SARS-associated HLA alleles that have been reported in any single population could not be verified in either of the other two populations. It also seems that the Guangzhou population was more susceptible to the SARS epidemic irrespective of their HLA profiles. The mutation of SARS-CoV could give rise to variations and discrepancies in the results of the HLA association studies in the three populations, and large-scale studies are essential for the demonstration of an association of HLA variation with susceptibility to a disease. On the other hand, mutation of SARS-CoV might result in changes of its T-cell receptor epitope, which would require a specific HLA allele(s) for presentation. Because of the poor fidelity of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, genetic variation typically gives rise to a heterogeneous virus pool in RNA populations, including coronaviruses. This feature makes viruses highly adaptable and contributes to difficulties in preventing and controlling viral diseases. The virus isolated from the Guangzhou patients is the prototype of the SARS-CoV, with a reported moderate mutation rate, that subsequently was found in Hong Kong and countries around the world (Zhao et al., 2004) . The Guangzhou SARS-CoV has the highest homology (> 99%) with the sequences of the SARS-CoV that were isolated from SARS cases in Hong Kong, Beijing, Singapore, Canada and the USA, suggesting that all of these SARS-CoV are closely related , therefore mutation of SARS-CoV could not be considered as a major contributory factor in the lack of HLA association observed in the present study.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1501, "end": 1520, "text": "(Zhao et al., 2004)", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 279, "end": 286, "text": "Table 4", "ref_id": "TABREF4"}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "During the SARS episode in Guangdong, six of the 95 SARS patients died of the disease.
