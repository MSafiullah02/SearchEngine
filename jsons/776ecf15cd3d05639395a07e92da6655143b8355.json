We developed a stochastic, individual-based model of transmission of COVID-19 in Slovakia. The proposed model is based on current clinical knowledge of the disease and takes into account the age structure of the population, distribution of the population into the households, interactions within the municipalities, and interaction among the individuals travelling between municipalities. Furthermore, the model incorporates the effect of age-dependent severity of COVID-19 and realistic trajectories of patients through the healthcare system. We assess the impact of the governmental non-pharmacological interventions, such as population-wide social distancing, social distancing within specific subsets of population, reduction of travel between the municipalities, and self-quarantining of the infected individuals. We also evaluate the impact of relaxing of strict restrictions, efficacy of the simple state feedback-based restrictions in controlling the outbreak, and the effect of superspreaders on the disease dynamics. Our simulations show that non-pharmacological interventions reduce the number of infected individuals and the number of fatalities, especially when the social distancing of particularly susceptible subgroups of the population is employed along with case isolation.",

To evaluate the impact of these measures, it is essential to utilize methods of mathematical and computational modelling that can inform the decisions of the key stakeholders. In this work, we develop a stochastic, individual-based model of COVID-19 transmission in Slovakia. We take into account demographic and geographic distribution of the population, daily migration within Slovakia, and periodic contacts among individuals, e.g., in their households. Our model is inspired by the state-of-art models published for the modelling of COVID-19 spread, such as [10] . The model can be used to evaluate the time evolution of the number of individuals infected by SARS-CoV-2, hospitalized individuals, individuals suffering from severe cases of COVID-19 that require critical care in Intensive Care Unit (ICU) or, equivalently, lung ventilation, and to estimate the number of potential fatalities. Furthermore, we evaluate the effect of different NPI on these counts and hence evaluate their effectiveness in containing the disease. We model the impact of various strategies on the containment of COVID-19 spread [10] [14] [15] . In our work, we use the data on the distribution of inhabitants in Slovak municipalities, data on migration between municipalities within Slovakia, the counts of individuals diagnosed with COVID-19 on 11th April 2020 provided by Slovak public health authorities, and the data from COVID-19 Mobility Trends Reports provided by Apple Inc.

These models describe the spread of COVID-19 across the UK and US [10] and globally [21] . The models are based on the original model of the spread of pandemic influenza by Halloran, et al. [11] . In these modelling frameworks, individuals reside together in households, attend schools, workplaces, and move in the wider community, where contacts between the individuals occur [10] . The model described in [10] utilizes detailed Census data to approximate these phenomena and to model the interactions between the individuals. While reproducing this model is not feasible due to the absence of the required data, its conceptual importance and some key aspects of this work (e.g., hospitalization, ICU requirements and various NPI) informed our work. The model assumes that the transmissions of the disease occur between the susceptible and infectious individuals at all the aforementioned places (home, school, workplace, or randomly in the community; where the last type of transmission depends on the spatial distance). The importance of this model lies in the fact that it allows for the evaluation of the impact of mitigation and suppression [10] on the spread of the disease. The brief summary of these strategies can be found in [10] and [22] . Ferguson et al. evaluated the impact of different NPI utilized in mitigation or suppression strategy, either individually or in combination. While this model has been criticised [23] , we believe that the critique is not based on substantial grounds, as the authors do not provide research results refuting the work in [10] .",

Furthermore, their impact on the disease dynamics was negligible, as we assumed that these individuals were isolated and cannot spread the disease further. We assumed that the initial locations of the exposed individuals that have been infected were as published on 11th April 2020. The number of infected (exposed) individuals at the start of the simulation was set to be 729 in all simulations, which corresponds to the data available from the IZP. We note that because of the relatively low level of testing in Slovakia and high number of asymptomatic infections, this initial number of exposed individuals almost certainly underestimates the true number of infected individuals.

Infection Fatality Ratio in Table 1 is provided as the proportion of infected individuals who die as a consequence of the disease. We assumed that only the individuals that require ICU can die (transition to \"Dead\" state). It is known that even access to the ICU does not ensure that the individuals with severe cases of the disease survive [40] .

We assumed that an individual does not become infectious until the onset of the symptoms, based on the fact that the infectiousness of the individual before the onset of the symptoms is significantly lower [41] . We also assumed that 40% of the individuals are asymptomatic or have a very mild course of the disease, which means that they do not display symptoms of COVID-19, but they can still spread the disease based on the assumptions in [10] during the period of infectiousness. Hence, we assume that only 60% of patients that are infected will display the symptoms of COVID-19. Furthermore, we assumed that the duration of the infectiousness (i.e. the period during which the patient is infectious) is sampled from Normal distribution with a mean of 6.5 days and Variance of 1 Day 2 . While this value varies based on different sources, we believe that due to the increased public awareness and self-isolation measures, individuals either self-isolate themselves within that period after the onset of symptoms or experience severe course of the disease and are treated in the hospitals under the strict quarantine measures, where the possibility of spread is limited due to the extended use of the personal protection equipment [25]. The important parameter that governs the spread of epidemics is the basic reproduction number, R 0 . Based on the early growth rate in Wuhan [15] [34], we set R 0 = 2.4 in the absence of any NPI. We assumed that the individuals who have been infected are immune to reinfection in the short term [10] [42], although more research is needed to confirm this assumption [43] . Time from the infection to hospitalization was sampled from Normal distribution with a mean of 10 days and Variance of 1.5 Day 2 [10] . We assumed that if an individual is hospitalized and has a mild course of the disease, she spends the time in hospital that is drawn from Normal distribution with a mean of 8 days and Variance of 1 Day 2 [10] . If an individual suffers from the severe course of the disease, she first spends time drawn from Normal distribution with a mean of 6 days and Variance of 1.5 Day 2 in the normal hospital bed [10] and subsequently spends time drawn from Normal distribution with a mean of 10 days and Variance of 1 Day 2 in the ICU [10] (Figure 2 , Figure S9 , Table 2 .)",

Evaluating the spread of COVID-19 in Slovakia in the absence of NPI First, we simulated the spread of COVID-19 in the absence of the social-distancing measures, assuming that the characteristic number of contacts among the individuals outside the household is n \u223c P oisson(\u03bb = 15). We initialized the simulation based on the published number and locations of infected individuals as described in the Methods section. Such a scenario corresponds to the unmitigated strategy, in which the disease is allowed to spread through the population so that the collective immunity can be built up. The simulation was conducted as described in the Methods section ( Figure 3 ). The simulation suggests that the total number of the infected individuals is approx. 63% of the total population. The overall number of deaths nears 36,000, or around 0.65%, which is significantly lower than the adjusted Case Fatality Ratio (CFR) of 1.38% reported in [48] for China. The peak in the number of hospitalized occurs 56 days after the start of the simulation. The peak number of ICU beds required is approx. 21,000, which far exceeds the capacities of Slovak healthcare system (black dashed line in the Figure 3 ). These results suggest that the absence of the governmental action enforcing the social distancing would lead to a significant burden on the healthcare system and to the significant number of fatalities, especially considering that the current Slovak ICU capacity is only at around 500 ICU beds with ventilators [49] , with the planned increase to 1000 ICU beds with ventilators.

Estimation of the COVID-19 spread in the presence of the current NPI After the first cases of the COVID-19 in Slovakia, strict social distancing and mobility restriction measures such as mandatory face mask wearing in the public spaces, closure of the schools, universities, churches, and non-essential businesses were imposed. To assess the impact of the decrease in mobility currently imposed on Slovakia, we utilized the Apple Mobility Trends Reports [16] , which describes the relative mobility changes in terms of Driving, Walking, and Transit when compared to the baseline value from 13th January 2020 across the whole country. These data on the mobility reduction are shown in Table 3 . While such data have significant limitations such as only taking into account the movement of users of the Apple devices and the baseline determined using one data point only, it is currently the best available mobility indicator that we have at our disposal.

To demonstrate the effect of such targeted measures, we simulated the implementation of the relatively strict NPI as described in Results, Section B, for 60 days. Subsequently, we released these strict NPI and we restricted the mobility of the elderly for the rest of the simulation (210 days). That is, the mobility of the population aged above 60 was restricted to 20% ( Figure 5 ). The results of the simulation show that the total number of the infected individuals is approx. 55% of the total population of the country. The peak in the number of hospitalized occurs 79 days after the start of the simulation. The peak number of ICU beds required is approx. 12,100. While this number is still considerably above the expected number of ICU beds available, the ICU requirements are significantly reduced when compared to the case of the unmitigated scenario. Furthermore, the strict social distancing measures that negatively impact the economy are in place only for 60 days, a considerably shorter period than the prolonged time for which the NPI were implemented in the previous scenario (Figure 4 ). This result shows that targeted social distancing of the vulnerable, but less economically active subgroups can play a significant role in the fast economic restoration, although it is important to consider the adverse effects of the social distancing on the psychological well-being and reduction of the compliance in the case of the long-term restrictions [52] .",

We explored the potential impacts of this scenario on the spread of COVID-19, while neglecting the immense economic and social costs associated with this strategy. We initialized the simulation on 11th April 2020 as described in Methods section, with the number of contacts for the individuals travelling between the municipalities reduced to 74% of the non-restricted value. After 40 days, we introduced the \"lock-down\": we abruptly reduced the number of random contacts outside the household from its typical characteristic value (15 random contacts/day) to 5% of this value. This accounts for both disobedience of the restrictions by the citizens, as well as the need for maintaining the basic logistical functions within the country. We assumed that the contacts in the households are unaffected during the \"lock-down\". After 60 days, the strict restrictions were lifted, i.e., mobility was restored to 74% of the non-restricted value ( Figure 6 ).",

However, after such restrictions on mobility and social distancing measures are lifted, there is a rebound in the number of new cases of COVID-19 and the demands for ICU raises to more than 12,000, albeit this raise is delayed. This suggests that 60 days of almost total restriction of the movement in the public spaces would not eradicate the disease from the population, which might be due to the spread of the virus in the households [45] even without consideration of the possible import from abroad after the opening of the borders. We also investigated the effect of shorter (30 days) and extended (120 days) \"lockdown\" on the disease dynamics. The results ( Figure S2) show that even 120 days of \"lock-downs' do not lead to the complete eradication of the disease and the rebound occurs after the restrictions are released. Based on these simulations, we conclude that even very long \"lock-down\" might not suffice if the disease enters a large and tight community (i.e., large household or a care home), where multiple generations of the disease might survive. In addition to that, we reiterate that such strict \"lock-down\" measures would have significant economic downsides. Furthermore, the implementation requirements of such strict measures in terms of logistics, law enforcement, and provision of the fundamental services would make this scenario impossible.",

Such \"on-off\" approach is, in a sense, analogical to the bang-bang control in the classical control theory [54] and utilizes the principles of feedback control theory by selecting the degree of the restrictions based on the value of one of the states, in this case, number of occupied ICU beds.

Time evolution of COVID-19 spread through Slovakia in the case of so-called \"lock-down\" scenario. Initially, the number of random contacts for the individuals travelling between the municipalities is 74% of the non-restricted value. The number of all random contacts between individuals is reduced on Day 40 of the simulation to 5% of its initial value. Mobility is reduced for 60 days and subsequently rises back to 100% afterwards until the end of the simulation, except for the number of contacts due to the travel between the municipalities, which rises to 74% of the unrestricted value. restriction in terms of the reduction in the number of random contacts to 40% if the total number of 1000 ICU beds was filled to 70%, i.e., the number of cases requiring ICU hospitalization reached 700. These restrictions were released if the demand for ICU beds declined to 50%, i. e., 500 beds ( Figure 7) . The results show which shows that after the initial long period of the suppression, the ICU-based introduction of the restrictions could keep the demands for the ICU beds below its maximum available capacity. We hypothesize that the ICU-based NPI are particularly effective if the mild restrictions are imposed even if the \"Switch ON\" number of ICU is not yet occupied, as these mild NPI can reduce the speed of increase of the ICU cases. The significant advantage of this approach is the potential reduction in the economic and social damage, which is caused by the NPI-related restrictions. However, additional investigation is required to optimize the limits on the introduction and release of the restrictions. The intermittent introduction and release of NPI for the ICU-based restrictions with different bounds is shown in Figure S10 .",

For superspreading individuals, we drawn the number of daily random contacts n S from the Negative Binomial distribution n S \u223c N B(r = 15, p = 0.1) ( Figure S3 ) [57] . The characteristic number of random daily contacts significantly increased for the superspreading individuals. The number of random contacts for rest of the population, is distributed as P oisson(\u03bb = 15) as before. However, to keep the constant effective reproduction number (calculated as in Methods section), the transmission probability in the random contact was decreased to balance the increase in the number of the random contacts. The simulations were run without any NPI. While the steady state values of the states are not influenced by the superspreading, the peak numbers of the infections, hospitalizations and ICU hospitalizations for the scenario including superspreaders are shifted to earlier dates when compared to the absence of superspreading (Figure 8 ).",

In the case of the decreased household transmission probability, we maintained the constant reproduction number by decreasing the transmission probability during the random contacts between the individuals (see Methods section). Simulations show that the increase in the initial number of the infected individuals does not increase the total number of the infections; instead it only accelerates the arrival of the peak of the epidemics. The change in the household transmission probability compensated by increased transmission probability outside the household decreases the height of the peak in the number of infections and delays its arrival (Figures S7 and S8 ). This is in agreement with the assertion that the household transmissions have a strong impact on the disease dynamics. ",

The model takes into account the clinical characteristics of the disease such as the incubation period, the significant proportion of asymptomatic individuals, and the time required for the progression of the disease from the mild to the severe form that requires hospitalization and subsequent ICU care. We consider the migration of the population within and between municipalities based on the real data [49] and stratification of the population into the age groups and households of different sizes based on the Eurostat data [37] . We utilize the data from Apple Mobility Trends Reports [51] to estimate the reduction in mobility due to the current governmental NPI. In addition to that, this work takes into account the effect of quarantining measures. Inclusion of the distribution of individuals into the households and modelling of quarantining measures represents an improvement with respect to prior modelling work on the spread of COVID-19 in Slovakia [17] , which only took into consideration the spatial structure at the level of the municipalities. Moreover, instead of dividing the population into three states (Susceptible, Infected, Recovered), we utilize more sophisticated stratification of the population into up to 8 states. This model allows us to evaluate the impact of NPI on the spread of the disease and effective reproduction number, reduction of which is essential for the eradication of the disease in the absence of the vaccine or herd immunity [13] . The comparison of features of the SIR model with migration presented in [49] and of the model presented here is summarized in Table S1 . Based on this comparison, we believe that the model developed in this work and inspired by [10] provides a valuable tool for the scenario-based projections.",

Apart from the lack of knowledge about the number of superspreaders, the probability distributions utilized to simulate the effect of superspreading, such as the Negative Binomial distribution [57] , are very sensitive to inputs, such as dispersion parameter [15] , and a lack of accuracy in parameter selection can lead to the large variability in the results. Although initial estimates of superspreading parameters were very inaccurate [15] , recent research suggests improvement in this accuracy [56] and we hope to utilize it in future work. Additional epidemiological groundwork and contact tracing could improve our ability to adequately assess the effect of superspreading.",

In our analysis, this approach has shown promising results, as it was able to reduce the number of cases that require ICU beds below the critical capacity, while potentially allowing for the intermittent release of the restrictions, which would presumably have a salutatory impact on the economy and social cohesion. However, our analysis is by no means complete and further work is required to find the optimal NPI strategy that would strike a balance between the economic and social costs associated with imposing NPI and the potential increased risk to the health of the individuals associated with the relaxation of NPI. Hence, this research direction can be further explored by utilizing the methods of deterministic [60] [54] or stochastic optimal control theory [61] , or Reinforcement Learning [62] .",

Testing and contact tracing in these locations is in progress, and we hope that it will elucidate the potential impact of these communities on the COVID-19 spread. Nevertheless, more data and discussions with experts are needed to fully capture the complexity of this issue. Fourth, currently, we do not have enough data available to describe the interaction among the individuals within the fine social network structure, which prevents us from describing the fine-grained details of the transmission of the disease through the networks of the social interactions among individuals [32] [63] . Instead, we are relying on the random mixing of the individuals within the municipalities. However, we believe that this issue can be ameliorated by the availability of the data from the telecommunication companies. Fifth, we are aware that the effect of face mask wearing, which might have a significant role in containing COVID-19 spread, has not been evaluated, as the data on their impact on reduction of reproduction number were published only recently [64] . We are also aware of the absence of consideration of the effect of gloves wearing and relatively closely observed social distancing in the public spaces, which further decrease the rate of disease transmission. Such decrease can potentially be significant and can significantly alter the transmission dynamics. In Table S2 we propose several specific potential improvements that could be implemented in the short and medium-term, along with their implementation period.",
