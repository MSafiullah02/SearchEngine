These apps were curated by a research team that included an emergency medicine attending and physician scientist in geriatrics and digital health, a medical student, a graduate student in biotechnology, and others. The apps are categorized by common healthcare needs within the OA population addressed by the following categories: 1) social networking; 2) medical, with subcategories a) telemedicine and b) prescription management; 3) health and fitness; 4) food and drink; and 5) visual and hearing impairment. App categories were determined based on app categories already in place on the Apple Store, with the exception of a category to address the specific needs of OAs with visual and hearing impairment, for which we did a custom search using the terms \"blind\" and \"deaf\" Details about the app developer, cost (both to download and for services included in the app), function, ratings and reviews, and user experience (in the form of anecdotes) were searched and summarized. All app rating and review data was last updated to this article on March 18, 2020.",

Apps with broad acceptability were given priority. Hence, apps needed a rating of 4.5 or higher and at least 3000 reviews on the Apple Store. Exceptions were given for apps with broad appeal and applicability to the objective, such as FaceTime, Medisafe, and apps that assist people with vision and hearing impairment, as shown in Figure 1 . Apps were further screened based on function and then ranking. Users' experiences of the app were given consideration during the selection; hence, recent customer reviews that demonstrated that the app was a valuable product for an OA were selected and summarized as anecdotes. We conducted a literature review using PubMed and Google Scholar on the topic, but as many apps are not rigorously tested for usability and efficacy in the OA population, this selection was mainly based on expert review.",

It can run on desktop software including Windows PC and Apple's MacBook. 17 Nursing homes and OA living residences frequently use Skype to connect OA residents to their loved ones, even though the app takes some explanation to learn the software so users can fully understand how to use it. 6 Additionally, per recent policy changes by the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Office for Civil Rights (OCR), Medicare beneficiaries may have improved access to their medical providers through FaceTime and Skype by approving reimbursement at the same rate for an in-person as a telemedicine visit. 18",

DoorDash has implemented \"No-Contact Delivery Options\" as a response to COVID-19. The app allows users to fill out personalized delivery instructions, requesting drivers to leave orders outside to avoid person-to-person contact. 19 Users have the ability to text pictures and/or descriptions to where drivers should place their order, which may be easier for some than typing due to the loss of dexterity with aging. Due to the closure of many restaurants, individuals should verify that a restaurant is open before placing an order. Instacart, a grocery delivery service, has seen a surge in demand for the month of March 2020 due to COVID-19, especially in states with an increased number of cases, and also promises dropoff delivery that minimizes contact. 20 These apps can cater to the OA population by giving them the option to stay home or providing families with the option to order food for their older loved ones rather than deliver it on their own, if they themselves are in quarantine.",

According to an AARP survey, 32% of midlife adults provided regular financial support for basic necessities to their parents regularly in 2019, and more than a quarter of these adults reported that this caused them financial strain. 42 Hence, GoodRx may be useful for adults financially supporting older parents, and for working Americans laid off due to business shutdowns. 43 This is also a time when family members and caregivers who typically visit OAs and check on their medications are unable to do so because of social isolation and visitor restrictions at nursing homes and assisted living facilities. Medisafe could help OAs with trouble adhering to a medication regimen due to cognitive impairment or polypharmacy. Self-reported medication nonadherence is common in community-dwelling older adults especially in those with cardiovascular disease. 44 Cardiovascular disease is a known risk factor for mortality among OAs who contract COVID-19. 45 Medication nonadherence itself can be dangerous, as it contributes to more than 10% of hospital admissions in older adults, and is associated with increased incidence of heart failure. 46, 47 Hospital admissions may increase risk of exposure to COVID-19, and heart failure is associated with worse prognosis in OAs with COVID-19. 45 Thus, OAs should be especially careful about medication adherence during this pandemic to protect health. In one study, participants using Medisafe had a small improvement in self-reported medication adherence. 48 Therefore, Medisafe, along with its real-time missed medication alerts and frequent check-ins via phone calls by family members or healthcare providers, may help OAs stay in the path of medication adherence. In 2015, Medisafe announced a partnership with GoodRx to help lower medication costs. 49 Medisafe along with GoodRx could help reduce barriers to medication adherence.",

Health anxiety has been found to be associated with more \"distress, impairment, disability and health service utilization.\" 51 This finding underscores the importance of curating apps targeting health applications for OAs mental health. A study shows that OAs are \"motivated to use digital technologies to improve their mental health.\" 52 In a study with participants aged 18-49, frequent use of Headspace for 30 days was associated with improvement in mental health, specifically depressive symptoms and resilience. 53 In another study among college students, students who used Calm for eight weeks reported reduced stress. 54 Although there has been no published research looking at the effectiveness of using applications such ase Calm and Headspace in OAs, these apps could be a useful tool to address anxiety. 55 Social isolation and quarantine can decrease physical activity and promote sedentary behavior, which is problematic in a population that already spends 60% of awake time engaged in sedentary activities. 56 Sedentary behavior is associated with disability in activities of daily living, development of metabolic syndrome, and an increased risk of all-cause mortality in the elderly. 57 Long duration of sitting is negatively associated with femoral bone mineral density (FBMD) in women, whereas duration of light intensity physical activity is positively associated with FBMD. 58 Physical activity intervention has been proven effective in improving physical activity behavior in healthy OAs, and most sequences of yoga are classified as a light-intensity physical activity. 59, 60 Some small studies also suggest that, in OAs, yoga may be superior to conventional physical-activity intervention. 61 Suggesting healthy OAs to use an app such as Yoga: Down Dog could reduce the ill-effects of sedentary behaviors. Encouraging OA users to set a goal to pursue daily physical activity during social isolation and may serve as behavior intervention. 59 Yoga could protect psychological health in this difficult time, and help with sleep quality. 62, 63 In a study in OAs, chair yoga participants had more improvement in anger, anxiety, depression, well-being, general self-efficacy, and self-efficacy for daily living than control and chair exercise participants. 62 Chronic conditions common in OAs, such as hypertension and diabetes, can be controlled with exercise and good diet. 64 MyFitnessPal, which provides a calorie counter and diet plan, could be a motivator for behavior change. MyFitnessPal is a behavior intervention that could provide benefit of well-being, but it requires self-efficacy. 59, 65 Limitations of MyFitnessPal include unreliable estimation of (micro-) nutrients ingestion and ineffectiveness in patients without goals and willingness to self-monitor calories. [66] [67] [68] [69] Therefore, although MyFitnessPal may be recommended to promote healthy behavior, OAs should not use MyFitnessPal by itself, and work in conjunction with a dietitian if possible. 70",

            "text": "When asked about the vulnerable populations that have an increased risk of being affected by COVID-19, Dr. Lisa Cooper of Johns Hopkins reported that individuals with vision and hearing impairments are also vulnerable. 71 As of 2016, an estimated four million OAs had vision disability. 72 Vision impairments double the risk of falls, which one of four OAs experience, and are associated with morbidity and mortality. 73 OAs with vision impairments who live alone and do not receive any caretaker service have to overcome greater challenges regarding activities of daily living and instrumental activities of daily living, which limits one's quality of life and independence. Be My Eyes, the largest online support for the visually impaired, may be a useful resource to these OAs, especially at this time. 74, 75 Per Be My Eyes, over two million volunteers speaking over 180 languages have signed up on the app to assist those with impairments, increasing acceptance, socialization, and independence for this population. 75, 76 With the goal to help visually impaired individuals navigate through daily activities, volunteers have the ability to assist OAs who do not have support at home by keeping them safe, enabling users to have a sense of independence and support. 75, 76 An estimated one in three people between the ages 65-74 have difficulty hearing, with half of those older than 74 having difficulty hearing. 77 OAs with hearing impairment have a greater chance of becoming depressed due to feeling frustrated and embarrassed about not understanding what is being said. 77 Howard A. Rosenblum, chief executive officer of the National Association of the Deaf, stated that the US government must make information on COVID-19 accessible in American Sign Language (ASL), including information on how the virus affects education and employment access, among others. 78 Glide -Live Video Messenger enables the ability to communicate to the hearing-impaired population through ASL and/or just videos. This may negate feelings of loneliness and depression during times of social distancing for COVID-19. Additionally, important information pertaining to disease characteristics, local and state business closures, financial updates, and other communications on COVID-19 could be shared to those with hearing impairments effectively and promptly using Glide.",
