Inhalation injury related kinetics of currently available inflammatory biomarkers and novel Pancreatic Stone Protein (PSP) as well as their interference with septic events has not been addressed to literature yet. Methods: Analysis of the influence of inhalation injury and ARDS on biomarker kinetics (PSP, procalcitonin (PCT), C-reactive Protein (CRP), white blood cells (WBC)) in 90 patients admitted to Zurich Burn Center between May 2015 and October 2018 with burns \uf0b315% total body surface area (TBSA) over 14 days. Results: Twenty-five (27%) of 90 included patients presented with inhalation injury (median age 52 years [IQR 27], median TBSA 31.5% [IQR 21], mean ABSI-Score 7\uf0b13). At admission, only WBC demonstrated significantly higher values in the inhalation injury group (p=0.011). Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was present in 32% without association to the severity of inhalation injury (p=0.11). WBC, CRP and PCT failed to delineate inhalation injury related inflammation from septic progression at most time points. PSP was the strongest marker to identify septic patients both by its higher values and steeper increase over time (p<0.001).",

Its thermal component mainly affects the supraglottic airway, whereas the chemical irritation addresses the whole respiratory tract -inducing cellular damage, changes in regional blood flow and perfusion, airway obstruction, as well as systemic toxicity due to agents such as carbon monoxide and cyanide (2) . The degree of inhalation injury is variable depending on the gas components inhaled, the length of exposure, and individual preexistent lung diseases -and so is the resultant inflammatory response. Serum levels of IL-6, IL-8, TNF alpha and IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RA) increase with inhalation injury severity (3) . Likewise, increased inflammatory cytokines from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (e.g., IL-4, IL-6, IL-9, IL-15) demonstrated strong correlations with the grade of inhalation injury (4) . The measurement of serum procalcitonin levels at admission proved to be a useful prognostic indicator of the severity of inhalational injury (5) .",

            "text": "Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is considered a severe complication owing to inhaled smoke and fumes. It is usually defined according to the Berlin definition as acute condition occurring within one week of a clinical event (i.e. inhalation injury) not explained by cardiac failure or fluid overload and associated with hypoxemia (PaO 2 /FiO 2 \u2264 300 mmHG) plus a positive end-expiratory pressure of \u2265 5 cmH 2 0 (6, 7). Inhalation injury is associated with the occurrence of ARDS in about 40% of intensive care burn patients and is characterized by an explosive acute inflammatory response in the lung parenchyma, leading to alveolar edema, decreased lung compliance and, ultimately, hypoxemia with death (8, 9) . Interestingly, the severity of inhalation injury does not correlate with the development of ARDS in burn patients (10) . Still, little is known about the temporal kinetics of established inflammatory biomarkers in response to inhalation injury and ARDS in human burn injuries, such as leucocytes (WBC), C-reactive protein (CRP) and procalcitonin (PCT), as well as Pancreatic Stone Protein (PSP) as an upcoming sepsis biomarker. Pancreatic stone protein (PSP) has lately gained increasing attention in critically ill patients as accurate diagnostic and prognostic marker (11) . Originally described as a protein constitutively secreted by pancreatic acinar cells to inhibit growth and nucleation of calcium carbonate crystals, insights from more recent studies suggested PSP as acute phase protein activating neutrophil granulocytes in the early phase of systemic infections and sepsis (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) . Our group recently published encouraging results on PSP's J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 5 excellent accuracy in sepsis prediction in burn patients -outperforming established pro-inflammatory biomarkers such as PCT and CRP (19) .",

Fourteen patients (16%) died with significantly higher mortality in the inhalation injury group (p=0.008). TBSA and ABSI score differed between the two groups. As inhalation injury contributes as independent factor to the ABSI score, we adjusted all following analyses for TBSA only (correlation TBSA/ABSI r=0.82, p<0.0001). Inhalation injury induced ARDS was diagnosed in 8/25 patients (32%). There was no association between the severity of inhalation injury and occurrence of ARDS (p=0.11).

In our study, patients with grade III inhalation injury tended to show higher WBC serum values as compared to patients with inhalation injury grade I and II. Similarly, PCT has been found to be constitutively released secondary to inhalation injury serving as useful prognostic indicator of the severity of inhalation injury occurring in burn patients (5) . We did neither observe a difference in PCT, CRP and PSP levels between patients with and without inhalation injury at baseline nor did we find a corresponding correlation with the grade of the inhalation injury. This might be explained by a delayed expression of intrahepatic synthesis of CRP, while PCT and PSP remains rather unaffected by sterile inflammation caused by inhalation injury.

This kind of \"direct ARDS\" is to be delineated from ARDS mediated by the inflammatory response associated with the burn injury itself or its infectious complications (8, 9) . In the present study, we referred to ARDS, which was directly induced by inhalation injury and occurred within one week after trauma as suggested by the Berlin definition (34) . We observed no association between the severity of inhalation injury and occurrence of ARDS confirming previous findings (10) . Moreover, we found elevated WBC levels at admission in patients exhibiting ARDS with a poor odds ratio of 1.1. The other biomarkers tested showed no significant difference between patients with ARDS and those without across the first week after admission. These findings are concordant with previous studies investigating various putative biomarkers to predict ARDS (35) . Their data have been largely disappointing and the 'troponin' of ARDS remains elusive. During the first week after admission, PSP values (and other biomarkers) insignificantly varied between patients with and without ARDS, which is why the later/delayed increase is more likely explained by the septic progression of these patients than by the ARDS itself (6/8 patients [75%] with ARDS became septic).

Together with a high accuracy of sepsis prediction as demonstrated by the presented curve analysis and previous studies, this is a crucial finding emphasizing the profound involvement of PSP in septic processes (19) . Au contraire, CRP and PCT largely failed to discriminate septic from non-septic patients in the presence of inhalation injury. Additional comparison with patients without inhalation injury demonstrated constant PSP levels ranging between 20-30ng/ml for patients without inhalation injury and without sepsis across 14 days. Again, this finding substantiates the high specificity of PSP for a developing sepsis, which has been observed beyond burns (13, 14, 16) .

Leucocytes and CRP did not prove to be helpful for preclinical sepsis detection due to their strong interference with additional inflammatory insults such as inhalation injury. Similarly, PCT seems to be influenced by inhalation injury reducing its usefulness in clinical routine. It demonstrated higher values for septic patients at few time points but lacked a desirable increase over time reflecting the patient's deterioration. As to that, burn specialists might take advantage of novel biomarkers like PSP in terms of its robustness towards inflammatory stressors indicated not only by its elevated absolute values but also by its solid temporal increase in septic patients.",

Additionally, the ultimate goal in sepsis biomarker research is the development of a score that can be used for sepsis diagnosis and risk stratification (36, 37) . Ideally, such a sepsis score comprises a combination of several biomarkers, including proteomic, transcriptomic, and metabolomic candidates as wells as clinical parameters. In our opinion, PSP is a very promising candidate to be included in a score for sepsis in general, and for discrimination of septic complications in patients with underlying systemic inflammation in particular, as indicated by the results of the present study in burn patients. Current and future efforts by our research group head towards this direction.",

Likewise, the severity of inhalation injury was not reflected by an alteration of the biomarker levels (p>0.2).Time course of inflammatory markers as related to the status of inhalation injuryFigure 3 illustrates the biomarker levels over 14 days for patients with and without inhalation injury. WBC was significantly elevated in patients with inhalation injury during the first two days after admission (p t0 =0.011; p t1 <0.001). CRP time course showed no significant difference between the two groups except for day 6 after trauma (p=0.026). In contrast, PCT and PSP demonstrated higher values at several time points with a highly significant interaction for PSP between time and inhalation injury indicated by a steeper increase of patients with inhalation injury as compared to those without (p<0.001). Time course of inflammatory markers as related to the presence of ARDS Figure 4 illustrates the biomarker levels over 14 days for patients with and without ARDS following inhalation injury. WBC was significantly elevated in patients developing ARDS at admission (p=0.03) with an odds ratio of 1.1 (95%-CI: 0.9; 1.2). CRP values showed no significant difference between the two groups. Similarly, PCT and PSP demonstrated higher values at several later time points (from day 6/7) but were not associated with ARDS, which must occur within the first week as required by the Berlin definition. Time course of inflammatory markers as related to the status of sepsis after smoke inhalation Figure 5 depicts the biomarker time course for patients with inhalation injury and sepsis vs. no sepsis during the first 14 days. WBC, CRP and PCT demonstrated similar kinetics for both groups with no ability to differentiated between them at single days. PSP was the strongest marker to identify septic patients in the setting of exhibited inhalation injury both by its higher values and steeper increase over time (p<0.001).
