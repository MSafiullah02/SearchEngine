Daily diaries will also be collected during exacerbations until the scores for 2 or more days reflect the child\u2019s baseline state, which for each child will be established at enrolment, prior to any exacerbations. This assessment consists of a combination of symptoms (daily cough (yes/no), cough quality (wet/dry/none), cough score [46] averaged over two consecutive days) and signs (sputum color (if any present) using a color chart card (BronkoTest Ltd, London, UK), and crackles on chest auscultation). Children will be reviewed on days 14 and 21, and at resolution of the exacerbation. The exacerbation is considered resolved when symptoms and signs are the same as the baseline state. Post-exacerbation, the children will be followed up and evaluated clinically every 3 months for a period of 18 months or until their next exacerbation (whichever is sooner).

Culturing, identifying, and when appropriate, serotyping common respiratory bacteria are established techniques in our research laboratory [51,59]. Swabs are stored in skim-milk tryptone-glucose-glycerol broth medium at \u221280\u00b0C ,before being batch-processed for typical respiratory bacterial pathogens, notably S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae (including strains of non-typeable H. influenzae) and Moraxella catarrhalis. Batches of swabs are thawed, and 10 \u03bcL aliquots cultured overnight on selective media at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2. Growth of S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis is recorded and confirmed by standard techniques [51,60]. Two isolates each of S. pneumoniaH. influenzae and M. catarrhalis per positive swab are tested for anti-microbial resistance and stored [51,60]. S. pneumoniae isolates are serotyped using the Quellung method (antisera from Statens Serum Institute, Copenhagen, Denmark). Routine susceptibility testing using the calibrated dichotomous susceptibility disk-diffusion method. If the if the azithromycin disk annulus is less than 6 mm the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of azithromycin will also be determined (Etests; AB Biodisk, Solna, Sweden). For S. pneumoniae, the penicillin MIC will be determined for penicillin non-susceptible isolates (oxacillin and/or penicillin disk annulus < 6 mm) and for H. influenzae, the ampicillin MIC will be determined for ampicillin non-susceptible isolates (ampicillin disk annulus < 6mm). Interpretive criteria (Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute breakpoints) used for S. pneumoniae are penicillin non-susceptible MIC greater 0.12 \u03bcg/ml and azithromycin resistance MIC 2 \u03bcg/ml or greater; and for H. influenzae, ampicillin resistance MIC 4 \u03bcg/ml or greater and azithromycin resistance MIC greater than 4 \u03bcg/ml.
