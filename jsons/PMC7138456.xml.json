While novel immunosuppressive regimens have improved allograft survival and function, combined with surgical complications, these predispose transplant recipients to infectious complications [1, 2]. Invasive fungal infections (IFIs) are particularly concerning in this population due to the associated high morbidity and mortality [1]. The most common IFIs in SOT recipients are candidiasis, aspergillosis, cryptococcosis, and those caused by endemic fungi such as Blastomyces, Coccidioides, and Histoplasma [3]. The incidence of IFIs varies according to type of organ transplant, and the risk of infection changes over time based on host state of immunosuppression and many fungal factors (e.g., virulence and resistance of fungi) [2, 4]. In this chapter, we review epidemiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and treatment of fungal infections due to yeast and endemic fungi in SOT recipients.",

Resistance to azoles and echinocandins is increasing, and previous data suggested that prior exposures to azole or echinocandins lead to the development resistance and increased incidence of infections due to non-albicans Candida in SOT recipients [9\u201312]. C. auris is an emerging multidrug-resistant yeast in the healthcare settings in the USA and other parts of the world (Spain, South America, and Asia) [13].",

Most infections are caused by C. neoformans although infections due to C. gattii have emerged in North America since 1999 where it was in the past more typical of tropical and subtropical areas [15]. Cryptococcosis causes approximately 8% of IFIs in SOT recipients [3] and has an overall mortality of 14% at 90 days after diagnosis in this population [16]. The median time to cryptococcosis ranges between 16 and 21 months posttransplantation, although time to onset was earlier (<12 months) in liver and lung transplant recipients possibly related to the more intense immunosuppression they receive compared to other types of transplants [16, 17]. A recent multicenter study suggested that lung transplant recipients are at highest risk of cryptococcosis [18]. When infection occurs in the first 30 days posttransplantation, donor-derived cryptococcosis should be considered [14].",

The disease may be primary or secondary to reactivation of a latent infection [20] and may occur in up to 8% of transplant patients in endemic areas [21].

Candida species are the common cause of IFIs in the early period. The intermediate interval has the most frequent IFIs as immunosuppression plays a major role, while the effects of surgical and nosocomial factors decrease. IC is less common, while mold infections due to aspergillosis, mucormycosis, scedosporiosis, or other molds predominate [3]. By late stage when 80% of SOT recipients are maintained on minimal chronic immunosuppression, the risk of IFIs declines [2]. The predominant fungal pathogens in this interval are Cryptococcus and endemic fungi, but mold infections such as aspergillosis and mucormycosis are possible and may occur at any time posttransplantation [3, 17].",

Calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs) (such as cyclosporine and tacrolimus) have synergistic antifungal activity against C. neoformans isolates, and thus, cryptococcal disease in SOT recipients manifests with skin and soft tissue disease rather than CNS disease owing to the antifungal activity of tacrolimus at 37\u201339 \u00b0C and the lower skin temperatures [38]. Episodes of rejection pose a particular risk for IFIs as patients receive pulse doses of glucocorticoids, intensified immunosuppressive therapy, ATG, and monoclonal antibodies as well as they experience high rates of cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation which can contribute to IFIs and immunosuppression [37].",

Pneumonia is common, and fulminant multilobar pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and respiratory failure are feared complications [20]. The most common presentation of blastomycosis in SOT is pneumonia, but extrapulmonary dissemination of the skin, musculoskeletal system (MSK), genitourinary, or CNS disease is seen in almost 50% of SOT recipients [3, 19, 54]. Clinical manifestations of coccidioidomycosis range from pneumonia to disseminated disease. Extrapulmonary disseminated disease in SOT recipients involves the skin, MSK, and CNS and occurs in about 1\u20135% [55]. Those of African, Filipino, or Native American descent, males, pregnant women, and immunosuppressed are at increased risk [55]. Histoplasmosis can involve any organ but most commonly presents with disseminated disease in SOT patients. Clinical findings usually underestimate the severity and burden of disease [19].",

Diagnosis of anastomotic tracheobronchitis in lung transplant recipients is to be based on direct visual examination, histopathological confirmation, and positive cultures [64]. Otherwise, the recovery of Candida species in sputum rarely indicates disease in the lungs [35, 64]. Isolation of other yeasts such as C. neoformans, H. capsulatum, B. dermatitidis, and C. immitis even without clinical findings suggests disease and calls for additional testing. SOT recipients suspected to have cryptococcosis should undergo evaluation with a lumbar puncture (LP), blood and urine cultures, and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) with or without biopsy [58].

Early antifungal therapy for suspected candidemia has been associated with better outcomes in patients with candidemia [79, 80]. Fluconazole can be used as first-line in patients with mild-moderate disease and who are unlikely to have infections with fluconazole-resistance Candida species [64]. The use of an echinocandin is now strongly recommended in the treatment of candidemia [64], especially in SOT patients with hemodynamic instability or with previous exposures to azoles or colonized with Candida species resistant to azoles [81]. Liposomal amphotericin B (AmB) or an azole should be used when other IFIs are suspected due to the limited activity of echinocandins, but the use of AmB is limited but its toxicities. Monitoring drug levels is important as azoles are potent inhibitors of liver cytochrome P-450 CYP3A4 and can increase the levels of CNIs, everolimus, and sirolimus [35, 82]. Patients with candidemia should have repeated blood cultures every 48\u201372 h until it is cleared, and central venous catheters should be removed as soon as possible. It is also strongly recommended to do a dilated fundoscopic exam in these patients [64]. Management of anastomotic tracheobronchitis should include using inhaled or systemic AmB. Treatment of other manifestations of IC is outlined in Table 13.7.",
