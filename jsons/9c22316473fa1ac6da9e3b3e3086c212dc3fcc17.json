Although some international institutions, in collaboration with governments and community partners, are working to sustain HIV service provision for people living with HIV, the COVID-19 pandemic presents several barriers and challenges to the HIV care continuum. 3 First, implementation of quarantine, social distancing, and community containment measures have reduced access to routine HIV testing, which challenges comp letion of UNAIDS' first 90-90-90 target globally, that 90% of all people living with HIV will know their HIV status. HIV testing is the vital first step towards initiation into the HIV care continuum. 3 Even with availability of HIV self-testing kits in some areas, 4 testing remains a big challenge in settings with scarce access to these kits. Therefore, increased efforts are needed to augment access and to facilitate testing.",

People living with HIV who should have initiated antiretroviral therapy (ART) in hospital might be deterred or delayed because hospitals are busy treating patients with COVID-19. Furthermore, because many public health authorities globally are focused on COVID-19 control, allocation of resources for HIV care could be diminished, and circumstances surrounding the HIV care continuum could worsen.",

As of March 31, 2020, this organisation has had more than 5500 consultations with people living with HIV and has helped more than 2664 individuals obtain antiviral drugs. The Thai Red Cross AIDS Research Centre set up a visible platform outside their anonymous clinic with a screening system for every client, providing HIV testing and prevention supplies (eg, condoms, postexposure prophylaxis, and pre-exposure prophylaxis). 9 As COVID-19 continues to spread around the world, many locations are facing the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and barriers and challenges for maintaining the HIV care continuum. The situation could be worse in places with weak health-care systems. We recommend that",
