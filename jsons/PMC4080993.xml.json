Flavonoids are known to exert multiple pharmacological effects including anti-inflammatory and anti-viral activities including inhibition of seasonal influenza A (H1N1) viruses [14-19]. They may interfere with the influenza virus neuraminidase [19-21], the virus host cell uptake [20,22], or cellular signalling events like the activation of nuclear factor kB (NFkB), AKT, ERK 1/2, p38, and/or JNK [23-27]. We showed recently that the flavonoids biochanin A and baicalein interfere with H5N1 replication in lung epithelial cells but that only baicalein inhibited H5N1 replication in primary human monocyte-derived macrophages [28]. Although biochanin A and baicalein are closely related structures (Figure 1A), they differed in their antiviral mechanisms. Inhibition of the H5N1 neuraminidase appeared to substantially contribute to the anti-H5N1 effects exerted by baicalein but not by biochanin A. Biochanin A interfered in contrast to baicalein with H5N1-induced activation of constituents of cellular signalling pathways [28] that are known to be involved in influenza virus replication such as AKT, ERK 1/2, and NF\u03baB [10,29-32]. Notably, the effects of baicalein and biochanin A on H5N1 replication are complex and additional antiviral mechanisms are likely to contribute to their anti-H5N1 activities.",

Baicalein and biochanin A (both obtained from Indofine Chemical Company, Hillsborough, NJ, USA) did not influence ROS levels in non-infected or H5N1-infected cells in concentrations up to 20 \u03bcM. However, at a concentration of 40 \u03bcM both compounds increased the ROS levels in non-infected as well as H5N1-infected cells (Figure 1B) despite the differences in their modes of anti-H5N1 action [28]. An NAC (obtained from Alexis, distributed by Axxora, Germany, dissolved in unsupplemented MEM and adjusted to pH 7.4 with NaOH) concentration of 5 mM was sufficient to reduce the ROS levels below the levels observed in non-treated H5N1-infected A549 cells (Figure 1C).Next, we investigated whether the reduction of baicalein- or biochanin A-induced enhanced ROS levels in H5N1-infected A549 cells by NAC influences the antiviral effects of these flavonoids. H5N1 (MOI 0.01)-infected A549 cells were treated with baicalein 40 \u03bcM or biochanin A 40 \u03bcM in combination with NAC in concentrations ranging from 1.25 to 5 mM. NAC did not affect cell viability alone or in combination with baicalein or biochanin A in the investigated concentrations as indicated by the CellTiter-Glo\u00ae Luminescent Cell Viability Assay (Promega GmbH, Mannheim, Germany) (data not shown). While NAC 5 mM alone moderately reduced H5N1 titres (2.2-fold reduction), NAC 2.5 mM or 1.25 mM did not significantly affect virus titres (Figure 2A). However, NAC reduced H5N1 titres in combination with baicalein or biochanin A in a dose-dependent manner in this concentration range in A549 cells (Figure 2B). Notably, NAC also inhibited baicalein- and biochanin A-induced oxidative stress in H5N1-infected primary human monocyte-derived macrophages but did not affect H5N1 replication in this cell type (Figure 3).

Biochanin A (but not baicalein) inhibits the activation of signalling molecules involved in H5N1-induced signalling including AKT, ERK 1/2, and NF\u03baB [28]. Despite these differences in their anti-H5N1 mechanisms, both compounds enhanced H5N1-induced ROS formation in A549 cells, and the efficacy of both compounds was enhanced by the antioxidant NAC. In contrast, inhibition of flavonoid-induced ROS formation by NAC did not affect virus replication in H5N1-infected macrophages. These findings emphasise that flavonoids, a class of natural compounds known to exert anti-influenza effects [16-19,28], induce a complex range of pharmacological actions by which they modify influenza A virus replication including highly pathogenic avian H5N1 strains. These actions may be cell type-specific and include pro- and antiviral effects. The overall activity may be the result of the totality of effects exerted by a certain flavonoid in a certain cell type. A more detailed understanding of these actions and the underlying structure-activity relationships is needed in order to design structures with optimised anti-influenza activity.",
