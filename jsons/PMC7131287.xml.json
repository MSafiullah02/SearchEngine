These data are derived mainly from observational, and often retrospective, studies in which only routine microbiological investigations have been used. Sputum and blood cultures were the main methods of diagnosis (Box 2\n).2, 17 Hopwood18 identified a cause in only 9 of 23 cases, with a mixture of gram-positive bacteria, gram-negative bacteria, and influenza A virus. Benedetti and colleagues4 found a bacterial pathogen in 21 of 39 patients, with pneumococcus being the predominant pathogen accounting for 13 cases and Hemophilus influenzae, the next most common pathogen. Madinger and colleagues5 also found Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) to be the most common and H influenzae, the second-most common pathogen isolated. In these studies, serologic testing was rarely performed to search for atypical pathogens, such as Mycoplasma or Chlamydophila. Berkowitz and LaSala6 also found pneumococcus and H influenzae to be the most common pathogens.Box 2Bacteriology of pneumonia in pregnancy (in decreasing order of frequency)\n\nStreptococcus pneumoniae (including drug-resistant streptococcus pneumonia)\nHemophilus influenzae\nNo pathogens identifiedAtypical pneumonia agents:\nLegionella species (more common in severe pneumonia)\nMycoplasma pneumoniae\n\nChlamydophila pneumoniae\n\nViral agentsInfluenza AVaricella\n\nStaphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant strains)\nPseudomonas aeruginosa (with bronchiectasis, cystic fibrosis)AspirationFungiCoccidioidomycosis\n\nPneumocystis jiroveci (with HIV infection)\nData from Khan S, Niederman MS.

Atypical pathogens are not identified by routine cultures of sputum, yet are common causes of pneumonia in the nonpregnant patient. As described in numerous case reports and selected limited series, CAP in pregnancy may be caused by mumps, infectious mononucleosis, swine influenza, influenza A, including the novel H1N1 virus, Staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant forms), legionella, varicella, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, coccidioidomycosis, and other fungal pneumonias.3, 15, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26 Whether infection with any of these agents is more common in pregnancy than in the nonpregnant state is unknown, but certain pathogens represent a greater hazard to the pregnant woman, because of her physiologic defects in cell-mediated immunity.",

With varicella, pneumonia usually complicates primary infection in 0.3% to 1.8% of all cases, but as many as 9% of primary cases during pregnancy can be complicated by pneumonia.27 Influenza A is a common infection in pregnant women during epidemics and carries a higher mortality than in the nonpregnant patient,25 with the maternal mortality rates being as high as 30% to 50% in the 1918 epidemic.2, 3, 17, 28 In the Asian flu epidemic of 1957 to 1958, 10% of all deaths occurred in pregnant women, and almost 50% of women of childbearing age who died were pregnant.25, 29 This increased mortality was especially noted in the third trimester. During the 2009 to 2010 H1N1 influenza epidemic, severe illness caused by influenza was seen in pregnant women, increasing their morbidity and mortality and impacting the health of mother and fetus. Pregnant patients with H1N1 who were hospitalized showed an increased risk of obstetric complications, including premature and emergency cesarean delivery, and an increased risk of fetal complications, such as fetal distress and fetal death. Antivirals given early in the presentation of the disease seemed to improve outcomes in these patients.30\n",

Up to 40% of S pneumoniae may be antibiotic-resistant (drug-resistant streptococcus pneumonia [DRSP]). In vitro resistance of S pneumoniae is fairly low level in many cases; however, the impact of such resistance on outcomes when usual therapies are administered is difficult to document.19 If the patient has received any antibiotic in the 3 months preceding CAP and the pneumonia is due to pneumococcus, the organism is more likely to be resistant to an agent that was recently used.32 In addition to recent antibiotic therapy, another risk of DRSP is exposure to a child in day care, a potentially common risk for women who are pregnant.19 Community-acquired strains of methicillin\u2013resistant S aureus (CA-MRSA) are not being reported commonly but may cause serious forms of CAP after influenza infection.33 The organism can lead to a severe, bilateral necrotizing infection, because of the production of various toxins, including the Panton-Valentine leukocidin. Although this organism most commonly leads to skin and soft tissue infection, there is a case report of a severe necrotizing pneumonia due to CA-MRSA, which seeded the lung 9 days postpartum from septic pelvic thrombophlebitis because of an infected episiotomy site.34 Two other recent case reports35, 36 of CA-MRSA in the fourteenth week of pregnancy in a 21-year-old woman and in a woman in her thirty-second week of pregnancy described successful treatment with a combination of linezolid and rifampin. In the second case, clindamycin, an agent that can reduce bacterial toxin production and serve as an antibacterial agent, was also added. Aspiration is a form of pneumonia that can be a postpartum or obstetric complication, causing a chemical pneumonitis or a bacterial infection involving the pathogens found in the oropharynx and gastric contents, primarily anaerobes and gram-negative enteric organisms.",

The calculated score is used to place the patient into one of 5 groups, each with increasing mortality risk. In its original derivation, pregnant patients were omitted, but Shariatzadeh and Marrie38 have observed that all pregnant patients evaluated by them fell into the low-risk classes I and II, similar to age-matched controls. However, twice as many pregnant patients were hospitalized as age-matched controls with similar PSI scores, yet with a shorter length of stay. Thus, the PSI may underestimate the need for inpatient care in pregnancy, or physicians were being more cautious with admitting pregnant women even if there was a fairly low predicted mortality risk. Similarly, Yost and colleagues40 found that a PSI-based recommendation would have meant that two\u2013thirds of admitted pregnant CAP patients could have been sent home, but if this had been done, 10 of 79 would probably have required readmission because of a complicated course.",

Also, if certain infections are present, such as varicella-zoster or other viruses, the potential for rapid progression in pregnancy is high enough that expectant ICU observation may be justified. In the H1N1 epidemic, the hospitalization rate in pregnant women was 4 times higher than in the general population and was associated with a high risk of death and ICU admission.42 Also, death from H1N1 in pregnant women was more common than for seasonal influenza.43 Criteria for severe CAP used in the new American Thoracic Society/Infectious Diseases Society of America (ATS/IDSA) guidelines but not specific to pregnant women include the presence of at least one major criterion, such as the need for mechanical ventilation or septic shock requiring vasopressors, or the presence of 3 minor criteria.19 The minor criteria include respiratory rate of at least 30 breaths per minute, PaO2/FiO2 ratio less than or equal to 250 mm Hg, multilobar infiltrates, confusion or disorientation, blood urea nitrogen greater than or equal to 20 mg/dL, white blood cell count less than 400 per mm3, platelet count less than 100,000 per mm3, hypotension requiring aggressive fluid resuscitation, and hypothermia.

In choosing an antibiotic for bacterial pneumonia, the agent\u2019s safety in pregnancy and efficacy must be considered. Penicillins, cephalosporins, and erythromycin are all safe and potentially effective antimicrobials for CAP.44 The penicillins are only 50% protein-bound and can cross the placenta to achieve fetal concentrations that are 50% of maternal levels. Clindamycin is probably also safe, but there is limited clinical experience with this agent.45 The fluoroquinolones are commonly used to treat CAP in nonpregnant patients but are usually avoided during pregnancy, because of the risk of fetal arthropathy and malformations in animal studies and because they can be mutagens and carcinogens. However, sporadic reports of safe use in pregnancy have appeared, suggesting that they can be used if absolutely necessary.46 Other drugs to be avoided in pregnancy include tetracyclines (the mother is at risk of fulminant hepatitis, and these agents can stain and deform fetal teeth and cause bony deformities); chloramphenicol (which can cause bone marrow suppression in fetus, and if given near term, can cause \u201cgray baby syndrome\u201d with gray facies, flaccidity, and cardiovascular collapse); and sulfa compounds (can cause fetal kernicterus).47 Aminoglycosides should be used only if there is a clinical indication of serious gram-negative infection, because there is significant risk of ototoxicity to the fetus. Vancomycin poses serious risk to the fetus, causing fetal nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity, and similarly, should only be used if absolutely necessary. Linezolid is a protein synthesis inhibitor. Linezolid has no safety data available in human pregnancies. A few case reports describe use of this drug in MRSA pneumonia.35, 36\n",

First identified in 1933, influenza remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality from febrile respiratory illness worldwide.28, 50 Pregnant women are at increased risk of acquiring influenza and developing complications of infection. In one study by Neuzil and colleagues,28 pregnant women were affected more often than nonpregnant women. Influenza also led to hospitalization for acute cardiopulmonary illness more often in older women during the third trimester and in those with underlying medical conditions, such as asthma.28, 51 Historically, influenza in pregnancy has been associated with a high rate of morbidity and mortality, and epidemic infection may lead to more complications than sporadic infection.52 The course of influenza was first reported during the epidemic of 1918 when 1350 cases in pregnant women who had an influenza-like illness were evaluated, and pneumonia was a complication in 585(43%) of these. In 52% of these patients, pregnancy was interrupted, and there were 308 (23%) maternal deaths. The mortality was highest in the last 3 months of pregnancy, especially when complicated by pneumonia.50 Overall, in the 1918 epidemic, influenza during pregnancy had a 30% maternal mortality, increasing to 50% in the presence of pneumonia.53 Mortality rose in parallel with gestational age to a maximum of 61% when influenza was contracted after 36 weeks of gestation. In the 1957 epidemic, 50% of women of childbearing age who died were pregnant and 10% of all the influenza deaths were among pregnant women.",

Influenza pneumonia occurred in 12% of 102 pregnant patients with influenza in the 2003-to-2004 season and led to complications, such as respiratory failure, meningitis, and myocarditis.3 In April of 2009, the first cases of influenza A H1N1 were registered in Mexico and were associated with an unexpected number of deaths. Data from the surveillance system of the Mexican health authorities54 showed a death rate of about 1% of all confirmed 6945 cases, and the highest risk group was in the 10- to 39-year-old age group. Out of the 63 deaths in the period from April to July, 2009 in Mexico, 4 were in pregnant women. All pregnant workers were taken out of work during the period of the pandemic in Mexico. Surveillance data from the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC)30 collected between August 21 and December 31, 2009 showed that 5% of 509 hospitalized pregnant women died, and those with delayed antiviral therapy (more than 4 days after onset of symptoms) were more likely to be admitted to an ICU (relative risk 6.0) and have worse outcomes, such as death. The most common comorbid conditions found in these patients were asthma and obesity. In that subset, it seemed that patients with advanced pregnancy (second and third trimester) were at a higher risk of death, with four of the 56 deaths having occurred in the first trimester (7.1%), 15 in the second (26.8%), and 36 in the third (64.5%). Previous reports from the US CDC database collected in the first 2 months of the pandemic55 showed a high mortality in pregnant women. Six deaths occurred in pregnant women in the initial months of the epidemic, all in women who had developed pneumonia and subsequent acute respiratory distress syndrome requiring mechanical ventilation. A case-series from the state of Victoria in Australia56 identified 43 pregnant patients admitted to the hospital with H1N1, 8 of whom were in the ICU. Again, asthma, obesity, and diabetes were conditions commonly present in these patients, but about half had no comorbidities and the only identified risk factor of influenza was pregnancy. Pneumonia was a common complication found in 11 of the 43 pregnant patients. Only one patient died and there were 2 fetal deaths and one neonatal death, pointing to the importance of worse outcomes for mother and fetus. Influenza was associated with preterm delivery, and 36% of patients delivered while admitted to the hospital for influenza.",

Therapy for these organisms has been discussed earlier, but antiviral agents should be started if a viral pneumonia is likely, especially early in the course of illness.2 Antiviral agents, such as amantadine and rimantadine, can prevent illness in exposed patients and reduce the duration of symptoms if given within 48 hours of its onset. Amantadine is effective against Influenza A, whereas oseltamivir and zanamivir are active against influenza A and B; all can be used for prophylaxis in high-risk pregnant women or for therapy in complicated cases.2 Animal reports of teratogenicity with the use of Amantadine seem to be species-specific. Although many reports describe various congenital malformations associated with the use of amantadine and oseltamivir, none provide sufficient information for a conclusion on the developmental toxicity of these drugs to be reached. Despite these concerns, pregnancy is certainly not a contraindication for the use of antivirals, because during the 2009 H1N1 epidemics, the use of antiviral therapy with oseltamivir, zanamivir, and amantadine, alone or in combination, was associated with better outcomes if initiated earlier at onset of the symptoms (before day 2).30 The CDC recommends that for pregnant patients, antiviral drugs should be started as soon as possible after the onset of influenza symptoms. Oseltamivir and zanamivir are found in breast milk; however, the concentrations of oseltamivir in breast milk is about 1% of serum levels, and no adverse effects of lactation exposure to zanamivir was found in rats.",

Because of concern about fetal effects, the use of prophylactic immune globulin is recommended within 96 hours of exposure to prevent maternal illness in women without prior varicella infection (negative Ig G titers) or immunization. Although the use of VZ immune globulin in a pregnant woman may not eliminate the incidence of embryopathy, if given before maternal infection develops, it may decrease or attenuate fetal disease.70 Immunoprophylaxis with zoster immune globulin should be given early after close exposure of a seronegative pregnant women, with the aim of preventing disease in the mother but not in the fetus. Although expensive, one analysis suggested that the use of this approach is likely to be cost-effective.22 The varicella vaccine, however, is contraindicated in pregnancy because it is a live- attenuated vaccine.",

The severity of fungal infections and the potential for morbidity and mortality may justify the use of drugs such as fluconazole. Proper patient counseling should happen in those cases.

In one review of 22 patients with PCP in pregnancy, 59% with respiratory failure necessitating mechanical ventilation, 50% mortality for the mothers, 5 intrauterine deaths, and 4 neonatal deaths were reported.74 Women with PCP infection should receive therapy with trimethoprim-sulfa (TMP-SMX), along with corticosteroids if hypoxemia is present.
