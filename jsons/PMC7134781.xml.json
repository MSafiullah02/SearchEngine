The agents of most frequent concern, and therefore most likely to be considered in the development of biosecurity and biocontainment programs, are discussed below. Diseases that occur in the high-risk preweaning period are emphasized. Other diseases may need to be considered based on herd history, geographic location, primary sources of income that need to be protected, or other herd-specific factors. For example, vesicular stomatitis may need to be considered as a hazard on operations in the southwestern United States, especially those located close to slow-moving water that can harbor potential vectors [22].",

Together they are responsible for more than 80% of mortality in unweaned calves, and respiratory disease is the most important clinical problem in the postweaning period [26], [27]. These are complex, multifactorial diseases that are influenced by numerous host, pathogen, and environmental factors. Mixed infections are frequently present in diseased calves [3], [28], [29]. The causative agents can often be isolated from apparently healthy animals; disease occurs when the right combination of factors interacts to upset the balance between pathogen virulence, exposure level, and host resistance.",

The major infectious causes of respiratory disease in calves are bacterial and include various mycoplasma species, Pasteurella multocida, and, less often, Mannheimia haemolytica and Histophilus somni\n[30], [31], [32], [33]. Bovine respiratory syncytial virus has been associated with outbreaks of dairy calf pneumonia [30], [31], but other viral respiratory pathogens seem to play a minor role in respiratory disease in modern calf husbandry systems [3], [30], [32]. Acute BVDV infection can contribute to morbidity in calves because of its immunosuppressive effects, its ability to potentiate the effects of other pathogens, and, less commonly, its direct pathogenic effects [33], [34], [35], [36], [37]. In weaned heifers, another important endemic disease is infectious bovine keratoconjunctivitis (IBK, or pinkeye), caused by Moraxella bovis\n[38]. With the exception of BVDV, some Salmonella species, some mycoplasmal species, and some specific strains of E coli, the pathogens responsible for most calfhood disease are ubiquitous and are present in a proportion of apparently healthy cattle on most dairy operations [39], [40], [41], [42], [43], [44], [45].",

Most of these agents survive well in the environment, allowing for efficient indirect transmission [29], [33], [55], [56], [57], [58], [59], [60], [61], [62]. Given the presence of a particular pathogen on a farm, risk factors for calf morbidity can be divided into those that reduce the ability of the calf to resist disease at a given level of pathogen exposure (eg, failure of passive transfer of maternal antibodies; poor nutritional status; stresses, such as transportation, mixing of calves, or heat and cold stress; mixed infections; and inadequate vaccination programs) and those factors that increase the level of pathogen exposure (eg, poor environmental hygiene, deficiencies in housing design and ventilation, high stocking density, and exposure to other groups of cattle). The current understanding of disease epidemiology is incomplete for many pathogens, thus limiting the veterinarian's ability to fully assess exposure risk. For those cases in which the epidemiology is not well understood, the known risk factors for pathogens with similar transmission dynamics, for undifferentiated disease, or for the same pathogen in a different population can help provide guidance for evaluating exposure risk. For example, the importance of environmental contamination, fomites, or transmission by personnel working with calves in the epidemiology of Mycoplasma bovis infection is unknown. We do know, however, that personnel and fomites can be important in the transmission of mycoplasmal mastitis in the milking parlor, and without additional information it is reasonable to assume that these could also play a role in the calf barn.",

In many cases, calves become infected with enteric or respiratory pathogens within the first few days of life [45], [63], [64], [65]. Asymptomatic and subclinically infected cattle shed these pathogens in feces or respiratory secretions and large numbers may be shed by periparturient cows [29], [55], [66], [67], [68]. Neonatal calves often become infected in the maternity area from their dam or other cows by direct contact or exposure to a contaminated environment [55], [68], [69], [70]. Multiple-cow housing presents a greater opportunity for direct and indirect neonatal contact with infected cows than do individual maternity pens; for example, the risk for Cryptosporidium shedding in neonatal calves is higher when they are born in multiple-cow maternity housing compared with individual pens [71]. Maternity areas that are dirty, wet, or dusty increase the risk for calf disease and the risk for periparturient infections in cows [29], [72], [73]. The length of time after birth that calves remain with their dams affects the risk for pathogen exposure and therefore the risk for neonatal disease [20], [29], [42]. For example, in one study of 11 dairies in Ontario, calves remaining in the maternity area for more than 1 hour had 39% higher odds of developing diarrhea than calves separated earlier [44].",

The housing of susceptible neonates in contact with older preweaned calves or cattle of other age groups increases the risk for pathogen exposure.

The amount of exposure to direct sunlight greatly influences pathogen survival. In general, appropriately spaced individual calf hutches that are cleaned, disinfected, and moved between successive calves offer the best opportunity for limiting accumulation and calf-to-calf transmission of pathogens [73], [86]. For calves housed in a confined airspace, procedures that aerosolize pathogens from dust or feces, such as pressure washing, can increase transmission of enteric pathogens, and inadequate ventilation increases this aerosol transmission [29]. Large numbers of respiratory pathogens can be isolated from the air in barns housing calves that have respiratory disease [3], [33], [90]. Because reduced airborne bacterial counts in calf pens are associated with a reduced prevalence of respiratory disease, factors that influence airborne bacterial counts, such as pen design, barn ventilation, and stocking density, may affect transmission rates [91]. Independent of effects on bacterial load, poor air quality compromises respiratory defenses, which may increase the risk for disease [3]. Other housing factors associated with a reduced prevalence of respiratory disease in naturally ventilated calf barns in winter include the presence of a solid barrier between each pen and increased ability of the calf to nest [91].",

Mycoplasma bovis is believed to be introduced to M bovis\u2013free herds by asymptomatic carriers [98], [99], [100], [101]. Little is published on the epidemiology of M bovis within young calf populations, but there are several potential routes of initial exposure. Calves could become infected from their dams or from other adult cows in the maternity area that are shedding M bovis in colostrum, vaginal secretions, or respiratory secretions [60]. The isolation of M bovis from vaginal secretions of cows at calving [102], [103] and congenital infection of calves [104], [105] have been reported, although both events seem to occur infrequently. One of the major means of transmission to young calves is believed to be ingestion of milk from cows shedding M bovis from the mammary gland [11], [63], [69], [93], [95], [103], [104]. In fact, exposure to M bovis\u2013contaminated milk may be a major means of introduction of this pathogen into previously uninfected calf facilities. Because milk in modern husbandry systems is typically batched for feeding to calves, a single cow shedding M bovis can potentially expose a large number of calves to infection, and calves may be repeatedly exposed over the milk-feeding period. The importance of colostrum as a source of M bovis infection in calves is not well defined. Whatever the mechanism (infected milk, colostrum, respiratory or vaginal secretions, or congenital infection) by which calves become infected, they may then shed M bovis in respiratory secretions and transmit it to other calves by direct or indirect contact. Once established on multiage sites, M bovis becomes extremely difficult to eradicate, suggesting that continual transmission from older animals to incoming calves occurs [63], [99], [106].",

Distinct serovars and pilus types of Moraxella bovis exist, and new strains can be introduced by exposure to cattle from other herds [38]. The reservoir of infection is asymptomatic carrier cattle that intermittently shed bacteria in respiratory and ocular secretions [38]. The bacteria is highly contagious and transmission occurs by direct contact or, importantly, through mechanical transmission by flies (Musca autumnalis, Musca domestica, and Stomoxys calcitrans) [22], [107]. A large number of risk factors for clinical disease have been identified, including environmental factors (eg, dusty conditions and the amount of ultraviolet light exposure), season, the number of flies that visit the eyes of affected cattle, concurrent pathogens, the host immune status (eg, stress such as transportation can precipitate disease outbreaks), and the virulence of the infecting strain [38].",

            "text": "Johne's disease is endemic to North America, and the causative agent, Mycobacterium avium subsp paratuberculosis (MAP), is widespread in the dairy population. The NAHMS Dairy 2002 study [108] found that the within-herd apparent prevalence of MAP infection based on fecal culture ranged from 0% to 50% in 62 United States herds. Herd-level prevalence was not estimated, but in an earlier NAHMS study, the apparent prevalence of MAP infection was estimated to be at least 22% of United States dairy herds [109]. Transmission occurs primarily by the fecal\u2013oral route, most importantly to a neonatal calf from its dam or from other infected cows in the maternity area [110], [111]. The organism may be shed in colostrum and milk from infected cows, and this can be a route of transmission to calves [110]. Congenital infection occurs occasionally [110]. Susceptibility to infection decreases with age, and young calves are at highest risk for infection. The bacteria can persist for years in the environment and so environmental contamination can be important, especially in the maternity area or other areas to which neonatal calves are exposed [110]. Recent research has suggested that calf-to-calf transmission of MAP may occur when heavily challenged calves are housed in direct contact with naive calves [112], although whether this is important in the epidemiology of Johne's disease has yet to be determined. A longitudinal study of MAP infection within one herd found that calves co-housed with animals that were later high shedders of the bacteria were at increased risk for infection, also suggesting that calf-to-calf transmission may play a role in Johne's disease epidemiology [111]. Well-established risk factors for MAP infection include (1) introduction of infected cattle into the herd, and (2) practices that increase exposure of young replacement heifers to the pathogen, including failure to remove calves from dams promptly after birth, use of multiple-cow maternity areas, feeding of colostrum and milk from infected cows, and exposure of calves to feces of older cattle [46], [113], [114]. Cleaning of maternity pens after each use has been associated with reduced herd-level risk for MAP infection [48].",

Sick cows are most likely to shed Salmonella\n[120], although subclinically infected cattle can shed large numbers of the bacteria [117]. Salmonella spp can also be carried and shed by any species of mammal or bird, and these can be important means of contamination of feed or water [118], [119], [121]. The bacteria survive in the environment for several months and can replicate under certain conditions of temperature and humidity [29], [57], [117]. Established risk factors for Salmonella infection (fecal shedding) in dairy calves include a high prevalence of fecal shedding in the adult herd and frequent or occasional use of the maternity area as housing for sick cows [51]. Separation of hospital and maternity facilities has been associated with reductions in the prevalence of Salmonella spp in herds with endemic infection [52]. The role of antibiotics in Salmonella shedding in calves is unclear; routine feeding of medicated milk replacer or milk replacer containing antibiotics was identified as protective for Salmonella shedding in two large-scale studies [51], [122]. Other investigators identified antibiotic treatment as a risk factor for Salmonella shedding in heifers within herds experiencing clinical outbreaks of salmonellosis [123]. In addition to being shed in feces, Salmonella can be shed in other body secretions, including nasal secretions, saliva, and milk. Infected saliva and nasal secretions can contribute to transmission by direct contact, aerosols, or contamination of shared feed and water sources [29], [124].",

Transplacental infection occurs when susceptible cows are exposed to BVDV during pregnancy or when a PI cow becomes pregnant [126]. Persistently infected cattle are the most important reservoir of virus; they shed high amounts of virus and are the most efficient sources of horizontal transmission to susceptible cattle [17], [126], [127]. Infected cattle can shed virus in body fluids, especially saliva, ocular and respiratory secretions, urine, feces, and uterine fluids; horizontal transmission can occur by direct or indirect contact with infected secretions [17], [128]. The virus is unlikely to persist for more than a few weeks in the environment [17]. Exposure to fetal fluids from PI calves, and failing to remove calves from maternity barns where PI calves were being born until 2 to 3 hours after birth resulted in infection of susceptible neonates in one study, emphasizing the need for good maternity pen hygiene and rapid removal of calves in BVDV biocontainment programs [128].",

Interventions to reduce the occurrence of PI calves and within-herd biocontainment programs to limit spread of BVDV between age groups are likely be the most important components of control once BVDV is present in a herd [129]. Before initiating a BVDV control program it is important to determine the current BVDV status of the herd (reviewed in [17]). The BVDV control program can then be targeted to within-herd biocontainment and removal of PI animals or to herd biosecurity as needed. The vaccination status of the resident herd and any introduced cattle influences the herd susceptibility to BVDV infection and should be considered when determining biosecurity and biocontainment priorities.",

            "text": "Infection with BLV can have significant impacts on dairy production and may also affect the marketing of breeding stock, semen, or embryos [130], [131], [132]. BLV seems to be widespread in the United States dairy population; the national herd prevalence was estimated at 89% [133]. Herd size, geographic location, and management practices were identified as herd-level risk factors for infection in the NAHMS Dairy 1996 study [133]. BLV transmission generally requires transfer of infected lymphocytes to susceptible cattle, typically by way of blood [134]. A small proportion of infections occur by in utero transmission. BLV is frequently present in colostrum and, to a lesser extent, milk from infected cows, and transmission by these routes has been demonstrated experimentally (reviewed in [134]). Whether colostrum plays a significant role in the epidemiology of infection is not clear, and some studies have not observed any affect of the BLV status of colostrum on the risk for infection in calves [135]. Maternal antibodies seem to protect calves from early infection, and the feeding of unpasteurized milk in BLV-infected herds can increase the risk for infection in calves that do not have passively acquired antibodies to BLV [136], [137]. Gouge dehorning has been associated with the horizontal transmission of BLV when instruments are not cleaned and disinfected between calves [138], [139]. Other management procedures that could result in blood transfer between calves if appropriate disinfection was not in place include tail docking, removal of supernumerary teats, castration, insertion of growth implants, tattooing, and ear tagging [134]. Use of shared needles or obstetric sleeves could also potentially transmit infected blood between heifers [134]. Hematophagous flies, including tabanid flies, such as horse and deer flies, and the stable fly (Stomoxys calcitrans), may play a role in horizontal transmission of BLV [134].",

Most infections are caused by the host-adapted serovar Leptospira borgpetersenii serovar hardjo, although several other non\u2013host-adapted serovars sporadically infect cattle [141]. Chronically infected cattle that shed organisms in urine are the major reservoir of serovar hardjo infection in cattle populations [49], [142]. For other serovars, maintenance hosts (eg, skunks, opossums, and raccoons) shed the organisms in urine, by which they can contaminate the dairy environment [49]. Infection is widespread; a survey of mature United States cows at slaughter found that 2% were renal carriers and 49% had antibodies to leptospires [141]. Transmission of leptospires on dairies is often indirect, through urine-contaminated environmental sources, such as water. Leptospires survive best in the environment when standing water is present, and infection occurs by invasion through intact oral mucosa or water-saturated skin [49]. Elimination of standing water, controlling wildlife and pests, and implementation of an effective vaccination program are the major means of reducing risk from leptospirosis on dairies [49].

If you are going to use MAP ELISA for your prepurchase screening of individual animals (test characteristics are the same in each herd; sensitivity = 50%, specificity = 99.5%) then this is what you will see from testing animals from each herd:What you as a veterinarian are interested in are test-negative cattle (boldface entries).

Highest priority should be given to keeping the maternity area clean, dry, and well bedded. From a biocontainment perspective, well-managed, adequately sized individual maternity pens that are cleaned and disinfected after each calving are preferable to multiple-cow housing systems. The use of individual pens minimizes the environmental build-up of pathogens and limits the number of adult cows (each a potential shedder of pathogens) with which neonates have direct or indirect contact. Successful management of individual maternity pens is labor intensive, however, requiring frequent monitoring of periparturient cows and moving them up to pens as calving approaches. After each calving, pens must be thoroughly cleaned and disinfected before being freshly bedded. Although multiple-cow bedded packs are commonly used as an alternative to labor-intensive individual pens, keeping these areas clean and dry can be difficult and requires frequent replacement of the top layer of bedding [73]. Regardless of the type of housing used, the focus should be on providing the cleanest and driest environment possible. Maternity facilities should ideally be separated from housing for other cattle groups and should be designed or modified to minimize pathogen accumulation by providing excellent ventilation, excellent drainage, and ease of cleaning and sanitation.

The longer the cow\u2013calf interaction, the greater the chance for pathogen transmission by way of feces, respiratory secretions, a contaminated environment, or ingestion of colostrum that contains pathogens. Udder-seeking behavior is likely to increase pathogen exposure, and so removal of the calf before standing is desirable.

Clean udders (clipped before calving, clean and dry maternity area) and good milking hygiene during colostrum collection are important to prevent contamination with pathogens, especially those spread by the fecal\u2013oral route. Pooling of colostrum should be avoided unless it is to be pasteurized, because it increases risk for exposure to pathogens. In some situations it may be advantageous to avoid feeding colostrum from high-risk cows. For example, in herds infected with MAP, only colostrum from low-risk cows (test-negative, no clinical signs of disease) or pasteurized colostrum should be fed [149]. For the control of BLV, feeding of colostrum from seronegative cows in herds of low BLV prevalence, or freezing of all colostrum in higher prevalence herds is recommended; freezing kills leukocytes and therefore reduces the chance of BLV transmission [47]. Bloody or mastitic colostrum should not be fed. Pathogen-specific colostral antibody titers and neonatal protection against some infectious agents can be enhanced by proper vaccination of cows during late gestation [150], [151], [152].",

There is therefore substantial opportunity to improve colostrum practices on United States dairies for effective biocontainment. Producers should consider pasteurization of colostrum, especially in herds in which control of Johne's disease, Mycoplasma bovis, and Salmonella infections are identified as priorities; readers are referred to the chapter on colostrum management in this issue for discussion of pasteurization. Although colostrum substitutes may not provide an equivalent level of passive transfer as does feeding whole colostrum [153], [154], [155], their use may be indicated when clean colostrum from disease-free cows is not available.",

Hutches should be situated at least 4 ft apart on well-drained, elevated ground, and bedding should be kept clean and dry. Between successive calves hutches should be scrubbed, pressure washed, and disinfected or steam-cleaned.

Solid side-walls with open fronts and backs facilitated pen ventilation while minimizing respiratory disease in one study [91]. Factors that impact pen-level air quality, including stocking density, barn ventilation, bedding management, and pen design, should be assessed and deficiencies addressed. Providing suitable nesting material (eg, deep straw) when environmental temperatures fall below the thermoneutral zone of the calf is preferable to reducing barn ventilation for the prevention of respiratory disease [91].

As for preweaned calves, ventilation, stocking density, and ease of cleaning, feeding, and waste removal are crucial considerations in facility design. Calf-handling facilities (eg, headlocks) should be present in each pen or designed so that calves can be moved easily to and from pens without direct contact with other calf groups.

Movement of calves should always be unidirectional; that is, calves should never be moved back from an area housing older calves to an area housing younger calves [20]. If animals have to be removed from a group because of injury, ill thrift, or chronic disease, they should be housed in a hospital area that is specific for postweaned calves. Some authors have recommended that if these calves are to be returned to their cohort they should be quarantined for at least 21 days after removal from the hospital pens [160].",

By reducing the number of susceptible calves in the population, vaccination reduces the risk for spread of endemic pathogens and reduces the risk for a disease outbreak after a new pathogen is introduced [20]. Because each calf-rearing facility is unique in the important diseases to be targeted, customized vaccination programs must be developed for each facility. For effective disease control, vaccines given before weaning should be timed so that protective immunity is in place when heifers are moved into group housing or off-site. Likewise, for replacements returning to the resident herd, vaccination should be timed so that protective immunity is in place before animals are transported.

These people should not handle cattle of other groups or should change into clean outer clothing or coveralls before entering the maternity area. Hands and boots should be cleaned and disinfected before handling each newborn calf. If the same person is responsible for handling cows and calves in the maternity area, the calf should be handled first. Footbaths should be used to enter and leave maternity areas, each section of calf housing, and hospital facilities. In calf facilities, staff should always work with the youngest, most susceptible calves first. Sick calves should be handled last; if possible, have separate people handle sick calves and neonates. After handling sick calves, hands and boots should be thoroughly washed and disinfected; ideally, separate outer clothing should be worn in the calf hospital area. Gloves should always be worn to assist calves to nurse and to handle sick calves, and these should be changed after each calf. During a disease outbreak, it is important to consider all animals in the group or facility as potential sources of infection, not just those that are clinically ill.",

Herd health and performance data should be reviewed regularly for early identification of potential disease problems. Producers should be aware of the need to discuss any unusual health events (eg, unusual clinical signs, increased incidence of clinical disease, reduced performance, or potential biosecurity lapses) with their veterinarian. Biosecurity and biocontainment protocols should be reviewed regularly and adjustments made as priorities change. Effective monitoring is essential to determine whether biosecurity and biocontainment practices are working. For example, if a BLV control program is established with the goal being to raise seronegative heifers, then regular monitoring of the serologic status of replacements is necessary to determine if the goal is being met. When a disease outbreak occurs, infection control practices should be reviewed with all personnel. Possible areas of biocontainment lapses should be identified and changes made to prevent future lapses. If a particular practice is not working, find out why and look for other solutions, or remove it from protocols.",

All farm employees should be involved because effective biocontainment in the calf facility involves the cooperation of personnel from all areas of the farm. A formal, written biosecurity and biocontainment program should be prepared and should be accessible so that it can be referred to as needed. Signs can be posted at critical locations to remind staff and visitors to follow particular practices (eg, to use the footbath). Incentives to aid in staff cooperation may be effective.
