On 11 th February 2020, WHO declared the name of this disease as \"COVID 19\";later the virus was renamed by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV 2). Even though the novel corona virus is genetically related to the SARS-CoV outbreak of 2003 but it is of different type in several aspects. [4] The COVID-19 outbreak created a major panic among all the citizens of the country owing to its severity, contagiousness within the community, lack of specific treatment and possibility of re-infection. All these factors along with the uncertain behaviour of the virus lead to state of fear and concern all throught out the nation. The complete dynamics of transmission are yet to be determined but the general transmission of respiratory viruses happens through droplets. [3, 5] Since the droplets travel approximately 1meterin air and quickly settles on the surfaces, person to person transmission possibly occurs between close contacts. It is advised to frequently clean the hands with soap or alcohol-based sanitizers and to follow stand hygiene measures because the contaminated hands is reported to carry the virus into the body. [4, 5] The known symptoms range from mild (cough, shortness of breath, etc) to severe (pneumonia, kidney failures, and death). Currently, there is no specific drug or vaccine,and the development of treatment and vaccines are under progress.",
