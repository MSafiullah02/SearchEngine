Many viral mRNAs also contain Cap 1 and 2 structures, but cap acquisition occurs distinctly among virus families2,6. RNA and DNA viruses that replicate in the cytoplasm cannot use the host nuclear capping machinery, and thus have evolved MTases to facilitate N-7 and 2\u2032-O capping or mechanisms to \u2018snatch\u2019 the cap from host cell mRNA1. It remains unclear how 2\u2032-O methylation contributes to viral infection or cellular mRNA homeostasis2,3.",

Remarkably, Ifnar1\u2212/\u2212 mice infected with the WNV-E218A exhibited a similar phenotype with only a slightly delayed mean time to death of 4.5 days. Ifnar1\u2212/\u2212 mice infected with WNV-E218A at day 3 sustained tissue titres that approached those of WNV-WT (Fig. 1d).

However, direct binding assays with recombinant RIG-I and 2\u2032-O unmethylated or methylated WNV RNA (5\u2032 untranslated region) showed no change in binding (Supplementary Fig. 4). It remained possible that 2\u2032-O methylation of WNV RNA affected other proteins required for transcriptional activation of the IFN-\u03b2 gene. To evaluate this idea, Ifnar1\u2212/\u2212 MEFs, which produce IFN-\u03b2 without responding to it, were infected at a high multiplicity of infection (MOI) and IFN-\u03b2 mRNA was measured. Notably, both WNV-WT and WNV-E218A stimulated IFN-\u03b2 transcription equivalently after infection (Fig. 2a). Thus a lack of 2\u2032-O methylation does not affect pathogen sensing or IFN induction. To address whether 2\u2032-O methylation of viral RNA serves to antagonize or evade IFN effector functions, IPS-1\u2212/\u2212 MEFs, which do not produce type I IFN after WNV infection but can respond to it11, were exposed to IFN-\u03b2 to induce ISGs, and then infected. WNV-E218A displayed increased sensitivity to IFN-\u03b2 pretreatment compared with WNV-WT (2,400,000- and 20,000-fold inhibition with 500 international units ml\u22121 of IFN-\u03b2, respectively) (Fig. 2b).",

To assess whether differential 2\u2032-O methylation of viral RNA might affect suppression by IFIT-1 and/or IFIT-2, we evaluated infection in 3T3 MEFs expressing a murine Ifit1 or Ifit2 transgene. As observed in primary cells, WNV-E218A replication in control 3T3 cells was reduced (\u223c5- to 60-fold decrease at 24\u201372 h, P < 0.05, n = 3) compared with WNV-WT, confirming that 2\u2032-O methylation is required for optimal infectivity (Fig. 3a).

In comparison, expression of IFIT-2 virtually abolished replication of WNV-E218A (up to 2,700-fold decrease at 72 h, P < 0.0005, n = 3) (Fig. 3b). Expression of IFIT-1 in 3T3 cells had minimal inhibitory effects on WNV infection (Fig. 3c). To confirm the linkage between IFIT-2 expression and restriction of infection, short interfering RNA (siRNA) knockdown experiments were performed. Transfection of a sequence-specific siRNA that reduced protein expression of IFIT-2 enhanced replication of WNV-E218A (P < 0.01, n = 3) (Fig. 3d). These experiments demonstrate that mouse IFIT-2 is an antiviral effector of IFN actions, whose inhibitory activity is minimized by 2\u2032-O methylation of viral RNA.",
