The infected individual (upon positive testing) then commonly is assumed to surrender her local information (commonly the temporal pseudonyms from encounters she was involved in) to a service provider. These approaches differ in the choice of centralized or decentralized information of those at risk: Centralized approaches assume the service provider to be able to map the pseudonymous colocation information from the infected user to the users or individuals at-risk (cf. the mode of PEPP-PT currently discussed for deployment in Germany), and hence to contact those directly. Decentralized approaches assume the colocation information to be published on a public bulletin board in some format that can be interpreted by all other users, to locally determine if they are at risk, or not (cf. Canetti [2] , or DP3T [8] , the \"decentralized\" mode of PEPP-PT).",

Additional threats are leaking the location of an individual, even the location of a pseudonymous user (as this may allow for learning the whereabouts of another individual, tracking of a user, and as previous work has shown that pseudonymous location information can lead to very simple re-identification [4] ), or encounters of two users (as personal relationships are intimate information, and even highly distorted social graph information has been shown to be easily re-identified [7] ).

We would like to stress, that our discussion does not represent an in-depth analysis, yet -some protocols are still in the process of redesign, for other protocols no public specifications exist, and that we have not proven any of the statements, so far. A future formal analysis with our notions will help uncover more intentional and unintentional leaks. It can therefore provide tremendous value to the discussion and choice of protocols for deployment, and help to design better protocols in the future.",

More Properties (Overview)We systematically discuss ad-hoc properties interesting for privacy notions of proximity tracing applications in this section. We limit this version to an informal introduction of them. A formal definition similar to [6] is future work. 1) Infections: Two protectable properties only concern infection events: Set of infected users U i : Who is infected (all or a subset of the infected users) is known or not known to the adversary. Number of infected |U i |: How many app users are infected is known or not known to the adversary. The number of infected is usually made public in regular time intervals. However, an earlier or more fine grained information about this might be desirable to hide. 2) Meetings: Properties that only concern user meetings and no infections: With regard to single users: Complete meeting info per user CI u : This information contains a list of all meeting events this user was in. This includes who a user met, how often and in which order.Meeting sets M : This only includes which other user each user met, but not how often or in which order. Frequency in users Q u : This specifies for any user, how many users a she met. Frequency per user Q: This specifies for any user, how often she met any other user. Frequency in meetings Q m : This contains for any user, the number of meeting events she had. With regard to multiple users: Complete meeting information CI: This lists all meeting events that happened. Compared to CI u this also allows to infer the order of meetings from different users. Partitioning P : This specifies the subset of users, in which each user met at least one other user of the set (connected components in the meeting graphs) in a given time span. Histogram H: This specifies how many users met how many users (e.g. 10 users met 1 user each, 5 users 2 etc. ).",

It includes which infected user she met, how often and in which order. Meeting set restricted to infected users M \u2192I : This specifies which infected users a user met. Frequency in infected users Q \u2192I u : This specifies how many infected users a user met.

Histogram restricted to infected users. H \u2192I m : This specifies how many users met how many infected users. In short, we restrict the properties above to only take the infected users into account X \u2192I in the combined properties.We can also turn this around to describe which infected user met which other users and restrict the statistics on the infected users X I\u2192 . With regard to single users: Complete meeting info for infected CI I\u2192 u lists all events in which an infected user is involved (as CI \u2192I u ). Meeting sets for infected M I\u2192 specifies which users any infected user met (not the same as M \u2192I , but includes same information). Frequency in user per infected Q I\u2192 u specifies how many users an infected user met (different information than Q \u2192I u ). Frequency per user for infectedQ I\u2192 specifies how often an infected user met another user (different information than Q \u2192I ). Frequency in meetings for infected Q I\u2192 m specifies how many meeting events with users each infected user had (different information than Q \u2192I m ). Similarly, we can restrict this for contact of infected users under each other: X I\u2192I .Note on other user sets: Similarly, we can restrict these properties on any other subset of users. Especially, the corrupted users are useful in the unavoidable leakage: X \u2192C , X C\u2192 and X C\u2192C .",

To capture this protection in a notion, we need a property that ensures that in the first scenario the same user was met twice and in the second two different users were met. Formally, such a property requires small extensions to the game, but can be constructed similar to T S in [6] . Note that depending on how close these two batches are, this idea is able to capture the leakage due to reused pseudonyms (if the batches are so close that still the same pseudonym is used, e.g. directly after each other as in the example above) or to cover the leakage due to linkable pseudonyms (if we force the adversary to compare batches that are in different pseudonym epochs).",
