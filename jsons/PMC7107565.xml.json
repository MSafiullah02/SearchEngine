But the world was able to completely interrupt human-to-human transmission, halt the epidemic and SARS-CoV is now eradicated. In the absence of vaccines and antivirals, this remarkable achievement was only possible because of rigorous implementation of traditional public health measures.",

An isolation room could also be equipped with negative pressure to reduce transmission via aerosols, but for large droplets like for SARS CoV, control was achieved without negative pressure rooms. Isolation of patients is particularly effective in interrupting transmission if early detection is possible before overt viral shedding. Given that influenza patients can already transmit before clinical symptoms set it, isolation is often too late to be sufficiently effective to halt transmission and control an influenza pandemic. However, for SARS CoV the incubation time is longer than for influenza (about 5 versus 2 days),3 and viral shedding was highest once the patient is truly sick. A longer incubation time allows for more time to identify cases and put them into isolation. The incubation time of the 2019-nCoV also has a median of 5 days,4 however, at this stage, it remains unknown when viral shedding and transmissibility peaks and how frequently pre-symptomatic cases result in secondary cases.",

This public health practice was used widely in fourteenth century Italy, when ships arriving at the Venice port from plague-infected ports had to anchor and wait for 40 days (in Italian: quaranta for 40) before disembarking their surviving passengers.5 Forty days provided ample time for the incubation time to be completed so that yet asymptomatic cases became symptomatic and could therefore be identified. Quarantine was implemented successfully as an effective measure during the SARS epidemic in 2003.6 It is also an important component of pandemic influenza plans. Quarantine means the movement restriction of persons who are presumed to have been exposed to a contagious disease but are not ill, either because they did not become infected or because they are still in the incubation period.7 Quarantine may be applied at the individual or group level and usually involves restriction to the home or a designated facility. Quarantine may be voluntary or mandatory. During quarantine, all individuals should be monitored for the occurrence of any symptoms. If such symptoms occur, they must be immediately isolated in a designated centre familiar with treating severe respiratory illness. Quarantining is most successful in settings where detection of cases is prompt, contacts can be listed and traced within a short time frame with prompt issuance of quarantine with voluntary compliance to this issuance.",

As diseases transmitted by respiratory droplets require a certain proximity of people, social distancing of persons will reduce transmission. Social distancing is particularly useful in settings where community transmission is believed to have occurred, but where the linkages between cases is unclear, and where restrictions placed only on persons known to have been exposed is considered insufficient to prevent further transmission.8 Examples for social distancing include closure of schools or office buildings and suspension of public markets, and cancellation of gatherings.",

Community-wide containment is an intervention applied to an entire community, city or region, designed to reduce personal interactions, except for minimal interaction to ensure vital supplies. It is a continuum to expand from social distancing to community-wide quarantine with major movement restrictions of everyone. Enforcement of community-wide containment measures is far more complex given the larger number of persons involved. Such measures are also ethically more challenging with individual human rights weighing against the public health imperative. The advent of social media is an additional challenge to ensure compliance. During such community-wide quarantine, it is particularly important to wisely use social media as social media provides an opportunity for communicating the reasons for quarantine, reassurance and practical advice and to pre-empt false rumours and panic. Implementation requires close partnerships and cooperation with law enforcement at the local and state level, and often involves checkpoints, and may need legal penalties if quarantine violations occur. A community-wide quarantine is currently happening in China on an order of magnitude that mankind has never witnessed before. Table 1  summarizes the different public health measures.",

Within a matter of weeks, China implemented all the tools ranging from case detection with immediate isolation, and contact tracing with quarantining and medical observation of all contacts. By 2 February 2020, 14 600 cases had been confirmed, and >20 000 cases were classified as suspect cases waiting for laboratory results, 113 579 close contacts were been tracked and 4201 people were released from medical observation. A total of 102 427 people were receiving medical observation. This is an unprecedented gigantic effort that surpasses all quarantine measures during SARS. However, the sheer magnitude of the new cases means that not all contacts can possibly be ascertained or monitored adequately. It means that many unidentified contacts are in the community. While SARS was mainly an outbreak that propagated itself within hospitals and confined communities (Hotel Metropole, Amoy Gardens etc), widespread community transmission is already evident for 2019-nCoV in Hubei Province and beyond. Hence, the most drastic of all classical public health measures was the only logical next step: community containment with social distancing, community-use of facemasks at all times and the city of Wuhan with 11 million residents was locked-in with the shutdown of the city\u2019s public transportation, including buses, trains, ferries and the airport. Prior to the lock-down in Wuhan, about 5 million (many of whom were already infected) left Wuhan thus contributing to further spread. As the community-based outbreak spread, lock-down was extended to >60 million residents in >20 cities by 30 January 2020. China has issued the largest quarantine in history.",
