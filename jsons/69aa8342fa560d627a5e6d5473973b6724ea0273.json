In Hubei province, the interaction between ARH and AT was found to have a positive effect on transmission (0.04, 95% CI: 0.004-0.07). Increased AT (ARH) led to a decreased effect of ARH (AT) on the incidence of COVID-19 in Hubei province. The exact mechanism of the interaction is unclear. One probable reason might be that a combination of low AT and humidity make the nasal mucosa prone to small ruptures, creating opportunities for virus invasion (Zhou and Jiang, 2004) . A previous study observed an interaction between minimum temperature and humidity on influenza ( province, which showed a negative relationship between AT and ARH and cases, with a positive interaction between AT and ARH.",

There was also a significant positive effect of AT in Hunan, Anhui, Jiangsu, Chongqing, Liaoning, and Jilin in addition to Hubei. However, AT showed an opposite effect in the nearby provinces of Hubei and two provinces in northeast China. We conducted a sensitivity analysis by fixing ARH at its 25 th and 75 th percentiles (Figs. A4 and A5), and the variation in the association of AT with COVID-19 with ARH alteration was not substantial. (Fig 5 in here) Fig. 5 shows the IRRs for ARH in association with COVID-19 when AT was fixed at its median for each province. Unlike Hubei province, other provinces including Henan, Anhui, had a positive relationship between ARH and COVID-19. The estimates of IRRs and the forest plots of the ARH with AT fixed at its 25 th and 75 th percentiles as a sensitivity analysis are presented in Figs. A6 and A7, and there were notable variations in the relationship between ARH and COVID-19 at the different levels of AT.",

            "text": "Firestone et al., 2012;Liu et al., 2019). However, previous studies have seldom analyzed the effects of the interaction of meteorological factors, focusing on the single effect of humidity or temperature on the development of COVID-19(Luo et al., 2020;. Hence, when estimating the impact of climate on the risk of COVID-19 transmission, the interaction between meteorological factors should be considered. Research findings on meteorological factors and their interactions should be incorporated into the prevention and control of COVID-19. With the arrival of spring in China, the increased AT in the southern region might lead to a decrease in the incidence of the disease. Conversely, in northern regions with J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f continuing low ATs and low ARH levels there should be more attention given to monitoring and prevention of COVID-19 due to continuing suitable climatic conditions in these regions.The effects of AT and ARH showed spatial heterogeneity and there are several possible reasons. The between-region variability of meteorological factors is likely the main reason for the heterogeneity of effects. Small sample size in some provinces leads to model instability and invalid estimates. Most of the daily count of confirmed cases in provinces other than Hubei included in our models (68.6%)(The Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia Emergency Response Epidemiology, 2020) were identified as imported cases from Hubei province or cases having a close contact with imported cases for the study period. Meteorological factors mainly affect COVID-19 transmission by affecting the survival of the coronavirus in the environment, and we assume that the coronavirus was unlikely to exist in the environment in other provinces, where most cases were imported during the study period. The city of Wuhan was forced to shut down both outbound and inbound traffic on January 23, 2020, and other provinces then also gradually placed restrictions on the movement of their populations. These intervention measures are expected to also have an important impact on the associations between meteorological factors and the transmission of the virus. However, because of the interventions that were progressively imposed during January and February 2020, the least biased (confounded) time series of COVID-19 cases is that derived from Wuhan and Hubei",
