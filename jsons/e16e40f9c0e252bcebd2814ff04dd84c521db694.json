Along with grave threats to social stability, economic prosperity, and human health, caring for patients places great stress on health care workers (HCWs) (1) . Because care of the patient depends on providers who are physically and mentally fit, the integrity of the health care system and its capacity to take adequate care of patients are at stake. The authors have had experience responding to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and H1N1 influenza, formulating a national medical recovery plan in Kuwait, responding to the 9/11 World Trade Center disaster, and developing peer support programs for health care. In this commentary, we summarize lessons learned from those experiences and provide consensus on best practices for fostering an organizational culture of resilience (2) (3) (4) .",

Shortages of personal protective equipment may provoke anger, frustration, and helplessness. Nonprofessional staff and those working in less visible parts of the hospital, such as laundry and facilities, receive less information, making them feel isolated and disempowered. Staff also must contend with sometimes daily shifts in policy, fear of contagion, and added work, as well as obligations to family and others outside the hospi-tal. If staff are unsupported, COVID-19 -related trauma may cause symptoms of distress and burnout and decrease their ability to function effectively. These symptoms may evolve into posttraumatic stress disorder or other chronic conditions (5) . Feeling out of control and unappreciated increases the number of people calling out of work. In the case of SARS, perceived adequacy of preparatory training and support mitigated long-term adverse outcomes (5) . This calls for health care organizations to support the mental health of HCWs.",
