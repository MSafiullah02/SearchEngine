Based on the viral replication time of 6-8hr, we considered frequent and high-dose administration is necessary to reach enough drug in alveoli. Furthermore, we thought it is desirable to continue for about 14 days or longer after starting to avoid reactivation of residual virus, and appearance of resistant virus. Since the virus replicates in alveolar epithelial cells, it is considered that inhaling as deeply as possible will enhance the effect. Based on the above considerations and the dosage form, it is proposed to use the following doses as standard at this time. Immediately after admission, symptoms of pneumonia became rather serious, and as noted in many reports, they seemed to worsen rapidly 7 to 10 days after onset, even if the initial symptoms were mild. At the time, our hospital was unable to provide a respirator in an infectious disease ward, and we felt a great danger in having pneumonia patients with worsening symptoms. We started administration of ciclesonide immediately after we received the information on February 19. In particular, case 1 developed pneumonia from the time of admission, started LPV/r and escaped the acute phase of inflammation, but poor oxygenation continued, and loss of appetite was prolonged. She became physically weak, was in danger of acute exacerbation, and CT showed a worsening trend. It was considered to transfer her to another hospital, but due to other seriously ill patients, we were forced to put her on standby.
