Of the six forms of the vitamin, the main active vitamer, pyridoxal 5-phosphate, is a cofactor in over 100 enzyme-catalyzed reactions involved in metabolism and regulatory functions.1 Pyridoxine 1 possesses significant biological activity in its own right as a cofactor for several enzymes and a participant in the biosynthesis of neurotransmitters and the production of nucleic acids. Recently, pyridoxine\u2019s potent antioxidant activity against superoxide2 and singlet oxygen3 has been documented. Additionally, pyridoxine can be prescribed to treat certain medical disorders. It is used as an antidote for hydrazine exposure from incidents involving isoniazid (INH) overdose and Gyromitra mushroom poisoning.4 Pyridoxine is also administered to treat ginkgotoxin 2 induced seizures that can be caused from consumption of Ginkgo biloba seeds.5\n",

As a practical consideration, the high water-solubility of pyridoxine can be problematic in extractions leading to significant mass loss.11 Pyridoxine is not soluble in many conventional organic solvents which can complicate reaction optimization. A key selectivity issue is the differentiation of the two primary alcohols. Obtaining regioselectivity at the 4- and 5-hydroxymethyl groups typically requires a ketalization protection strategy of the 4-hydroxymethyl and the phenol.9 A rare example of selective derivatization at the 5-hydroxymethyl moiety without the use of protecting groups is the lipase-catalyzed acylation of pyridoxine reported by Sun and coworkers.11 Pyridinone methide chemistry holds promise as a potential method for protecting group-free derivatization of pyridoxine since theoretical studies have shown that the energy barrier for the ortho-pyridinone methide is 8 kcal/mol lower than the meta-pyridinone methide.12 While this reactivity has been noted prior to this report, only three primary alcohol substrates have been synthesized in the past 75 years and in low to moderate yields. Herein, we investigate the scope and limitations of the catalyst-free13 synthesis of 4\u2032-O-substituted pyridoxine derivatives via thermal formation of a highly regioselective o-pyridinone methide (o-PM) intermediate and subsequent oxa-Michael addition of alcohol nucleophiles (Scheme 1\n).",

The thermal o-pyridinone methide reactivity of pyridoxine was first noted by Harris who synthesized ginkgotoxin HCl salt in a 12% yield by heating in the presence of sodium methoxide in 1940.15 This reactivity was further developed by Frater-Schr\u00f6der and Mahrer-Busato in conjunction with toxicological studies in 1975. They demonstrated that heating pyridoxine to 120\u2013130 \u00b0C in the presence of n-butanol and isoamyl alcohol with tetralin as a cosolvent provided the 4\u2032-O-substituted products albeit in a 49% and 36% yield, respectively.16 This report is significant as the first catalyst-free formation of these products; however, the report is limited to two substrates and the authors note the presence of dimerization of pyridoxine and other byproducts at such high temperatures. Recently, a microwave-assisted p-toluenesulfonic acid-catalyzed synthesis of ginkgotoxin was accomplished providing 56% yield.17 The low to moderate yields might be caused by the weak nucleophilicity of the alcohols as well as the observed reversibility of the C-O bond formation in the presence of water.16\n",

The geranyl example (5h) is particularly encouraging since it contains sensitive functionality that may not work well under the previously reported Lewis acid/base-catalyzed conditions. The ether moiety of 2-methoxyethanol (5j) was tolerated by the reaction manifold and provided an acceptable yield of 52%. Propargylic alcohol provided an inseparable complex product mixture with the Diels-Alder adduct. Other 3-pyridinol derivatives, (4-methoxypyridin-2-yl)methanol and 2-(hydroxymethyl)pyridin-3-ol HCl were attempted in the reaction manifold but only trace product was observed after three days with n-butanol.",

This operationally-simple methodology enables access to a broad scope of ether analogs from inexpensive, commercially available pyridoxine and alcohols in moderate to excellent yields via the rare ortho-pyridinone methide intermediate. The substrate scope demonstrated good functional group compatibility with primary, secondary, and tertiary alcohols and ether and olefin moieties being well-tolerated. The analysis of the biological activities of these compounds and the incorporation of additional nucleophilic partners will be reported in due course.",
