In forest areas, a cycle including primates and mosquitoes also exist. 6 To date, two manifestations, dengue fever and dengue hemorrhagic fever are known. 4, 7 The symptoms are same among the four serotypes. Once immunity is developed in a human, it remains life-long and re-infection with the same serotype does not occur. However other serotypes may then cause disease because of the incomplete protection of the first infection. More than tens of millions of people have dengue fever and more than hundreds of thousands of people are reported to have dengue hemorrhagic fever every year. Dengue virus is approximately 11 kb positive single stranded RNA virus. It consists of structural proteins of core, membrane and envelope, and seven non-structural proteins. Envelope protein is the target of neutralizing antibody and hemagglutinin inhibition antibody. Serotypes of dengue virus 1, 2, 3, and 4 are originally classified using antiserum, but recently they have also been classified with envelope gene analyzes. The similarity of envelope gene is more than 90% at the same serotype and 65% at a different serotype. Moreover, dengue virus serotype 1, 2, 3 and 4 are divided into three, six, four and one genotypes, respectively. 8 There are common and different genotypes in serotypes 1-3 in Asia, Africa, Pacific islands and Caribbean islands. Some genotypes appear in specific areas during a limited period each year. Variation of envelope gene affects the virulence of these viruses, and other structural and non-structural proteins might also affect the virulence. 7 Host immune response also affects the virulence of these viruses. At present, there is no clear explanation for the dengue and dengue hemorrhagic fever.",

The virus consists of nucleoprotein (N protein), non-structure protein (NS protein), membrane protein (M protein), glycoprotein (G protein) and large protein (L protein). G protein is closely related to infection (neurotoxin) and is a target for infection control. Recombinant vaccine has been developed using the G gene. Negri body in neuronal cells is found in the hippocampus of infected animals. The Negri body is composed of virus nucleoprotein. The nucleoprotein gene is conserved well and isuseful for molecular epidemiological analyses of the infected area. Genotype 1 (serotype 1) of classical rabies in Asia, Europe, Africa and the United States develop in separate clusters. The cluster is also differentiated within Asia. Sequence also has further small variations in the Philippines between Luzon Island and Mindanao Island. 22 Rabies virus was previously thought to have only one serotype, but a new type which shows the symptom of classical rabies has been found in bats. One example is Australian bat virus of genotype 7, and a case of human death involving this genotype has been reported. 7",

The other group is widespread in South and North America and causes hantavirus pulmonary syndrome. There are 24 species (serotypes/genotypes); four species cause hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome and six species cause hantavirus pulmonary syndrome. 23 The virus is secreted through urine, stool and saliva from rodents. Humans who aspirate or contact the virus can have the disease. In infected rodents, infection persists without symptoms. Hantavirus causes zoonosis except for one species. Bunyavirus consists of three negative stranded RNA (L, M and S). Each segment codes L protein (polymerase), envelope protein (G1 and G2) and Nucleoprotein (NP). The molecular epidemiological analysis is mainly done in nucleotides of M gene. Three different clusters were discovered: (1) ",

An outbreak of Nipah virus was recorded in 1998-1999 in Malaysia. 26 This virus was transmitted from pig to humans and it caused encephalitis in approximately 40% of infected persons. Pigs were infected from the urine of fruit bats living in the forest of Nipah. Pig to pig and pig to human transmission occurs through saliva and urine. Human to human transmission is rarely recognized. Respiratory syndrome is common in pigs but convulsions, abnormal movement and miscarriage are also recognized. The mortality rate for this virus is low. The virus infects dogs, cats and horses with the rise of the antibody level. The virus reached Singapore via pigs imported from Malaysia. More than 10 humans were infected and one person died. Hendra virus is similar to Nipah virus and was discovered in horses and spread in Australia in 1994. 27 It was transmitted to humans and caused respiratory symptoms. Currently classification of Nipah virus and Megapneumovirus is recommended as belonging to the genus Henipavirus, because the molecular size of these viruses are approximately 18 kb and different from other viruses of Paramyxoviridae (15-16 kb) .

Finally it spread to 29 countries including Vietnam, Taiwan, Singapore and Canada, and was spread mainly via travellers. The disease spread in hospitals where health workers and relatives of SARS patients were in close with patients. Fortunately, SARS disappeared in June 2003. More than 8000 people were infected and more than 800 people died of SARS in the 2003 outbreak. Considering the course of this disease, the disease started from the breeder of palm civet in Guangdong province and it is a zoonosis. The transmission route is usually droplet and/or air infection. However, fecus-oral infection and contact infection also occur. Effective management of a new respiratory infection is not easy. Research on diagnosis, treatment and prophylaxis are under way in order to counter the reappearance of SARS in the winter of 2004. 36 There are four serotypes in Coronaviridae, and they are described in Table 1 .

Human coronavirus was cultured in human tracheal cells in 1965. Coronavirus was discovered in vertebrates and birds. Membrane protein, envelope protein, spike and glycoprotein with hemagglutinin and esterase function, and nucleoprotein have been observed. Coronavirus causes mainly respiratory infection, however it can also cause gastrointestinal infection and rarely neuronal infection. Outbreaks of gastroenteritis have also been reported. Molecular epidemiological studies, understanding of variation of serotype and re-infection are not well established for this virus. Human coronavirus spreads mostly in children in winter. Infection routes are droplet and/or airborne infection and fecus-oral infection. Human coronavirus 229E and OC43 strains were known long before the recent severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus outbreak in China.",
