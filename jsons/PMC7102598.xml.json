The 4 hospitals selected for the study were the closest hospitals in proximity to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market (1-4 km away), which is the suspected origin of 2019-nCoV outbreak (Fig 2\n). Anesthesiologists in Wuhan have made great efforts to control this epidemic (Fig 3\n). As previously mentioned, anesthetic management and infection control guidelines for emergency procedures in patients with confirmed or suspected 2019-nCoV were drafted by an expert panel from the Department of Anesthesiology at Wuhan Union Hospital (Fig 4\n); these procedures are detailed in the Supplementary Material as follows: (1) anesthesiologists\u2019 procedures for emergency intubation of patients with confirmed or suspected 2019-nCoV infection, (2) precautions for 2019-nCoV infection in outpatient evaluation center, and (3) precautions for 2019-nCoV infection control in the operating rooms. After adopting the aforementioned procedures, the 4 hospitals in the study completed 321 cases of emergency surgical anesthesia, including for 37 patients who were laboratory-confirmed as having or were suspected of having 2019-nCoV. In the present study, 3 health care providers were infected with 2019-nCoV in the clinic setting from January 23 to 31, 2020.",

By January 30, 2020, 9,692 laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infections had been reported in China, with 213 fatal cases.5 In particular, at the same time, 15 health care workers had been reported to be infected by 2019\u00adnCoV, 14 of whom were assumed to have been infected by caring for 2019-nCoV patients. The overall infection rate of health care workers at the time of the present study was unknown. However, precautions and related management procedures need to be implemented immediately to prevent any additional infections. This has challenged health care workers to use effective infection control procedures and measures. Anesthesiologists, as specialists in airway management, generally perform endotracheal intubation in severe cases of hypoxia and provide emergency anesthesia for surgery in these cases. This undoubtedly increases the exposure risk for anesthesiologists because of the frequent exposure to patients\u2019 respiratory secretions and blood. Therefore, 2019-nCoV\u2013specific anesthesia guidelines need to be developed and used to prevent nosocomial spread of the virus.",

Therefore, all anesthesiologists who may be in contact with patients with confirmed or suspected 2019-nCoV must take level 3 protective measures, which are detailed in the Supplementary Materials. The World Health Organization also has released important information that has prompted health care workers caring for patients infected with 2019-nCoV to reexamine the precautionary procedures of infection control.4\n",
