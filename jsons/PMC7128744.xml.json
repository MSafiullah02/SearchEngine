Now, demand that this is an entire class of solvents that can be customized to specific needs and delivered in kiloton quantities. What do you have? Ionic liquids \u2013 called \u201cILs\u201d meet these requirements. One example is methylimidazolium chloride. This is an IL with a melting point of 75 \u00b0C. The IL is used in a purification process by BASF for scavenging acid from a diethoxyphenylphosphine production line. The IL is recycled by treating it with caustic, and regenerating methylimidazole.",

Once inside the cell, Triclosan poisons a specific enzyme that many bacteria and funguses need for survival. Triclosan blocks the active site of an enzyme called enoyl-acyl carrier-protein reductase (ENR for short), preventing the bacteria from manufacturing fatty acids it needs for building cell membranes and other vital functions. Humans don\u2019t have this enzyme, so Triclosan does not pose a metabolic hazard to them. One molecule of Triclosan permanently disables an ENR molecule, which explains why Triclosan has powerful antibiotic action even at very low concentrations.
