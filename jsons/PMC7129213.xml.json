            "text": "We speculate on the reasons why the results of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA tests, in this case, were fluctuant. First of all, no research has yet accurately established the contagious period of COVID-19. Besides patients and asymptomatic carriers, those in convalescence may also be infectious. SARS-CoV-2 RNA from respiratory tract specimens may be persistent or recurrently positive during the course of this disease. Furthermore, Angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2), identified as the cell entry receptor of SARS-CoV-2, was highly expressed in the lungs rather than in the upper respiratory tract (Lu et al., 2020, Zhou et al., 2020). The result of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA test likely depends on the viral load of the specimen. Therefore, there could be false negatives on occasion for oropharyngeal or nasopharyngeal swabs tests, affected by the site from which the sample was taken, the experience of the operator, and the actual quantity of virus. The Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) specimen test is considered more accurate but with a higher exposure risk. In addition to the above specimens, SARS-CoV-2 RNA can be detected in a patient\u2019s sputum, blood, or stool swab by RT-PCR assay. Running multiple tests and collecting different specimens would be more effective approaches to maximize sensitivity. Combination with the SARS-CoV-2 RNA test and other detective methods such as a specific antigen, IgM antibody, or the next-generation sequencing, is also conducive to diagnosis.",
