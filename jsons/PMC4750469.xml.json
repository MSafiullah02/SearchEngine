HRVs are classified taxonomically within the enterovirus (EV) group and subdivided into three species: A, B and C. Across the three species are more than 100 different serotypes. Since identification and designation of HRV-C species in 2006 [1], several studies have demonstrated increased rates of asthma exacerbations and LRTIs among children with HRV-C versus HRV-A or HRV-B infections [2], [3], [4]. However, more recent data have failed to observe an association between HRV species and illness severity [5], [6].",

From April 2012 to March 2013, we reviewed the NYP/WCMC Clinical Microbiology Laboratory records daily to identify adult HM patients (age \u2265 18 years) testing positive for HRV. We excluded patients with HM that was in remission and who had not received chemotherapy in the previous year. All hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients were included if transplant occurred within the previous 12 months and/or chronic graft-versus-host disease was present. HRV-positive respiratory specimens were frozen and shipped to Wadsworth Center at the New York State Department of Health in Albany, NY for molecular characterization.

All three HRV and four EV species are detected by the RP. Due to sequence homology, the RP assay does not reliably distinguish HRV from EV. For the purposes of this study, patients testing positive for the HRV/EV target on the RP assay were assumed to have HRV infection, which was confirmed by molecular testing at Wadsworth. In addition to the RP, the following diagnostic microbiology studies were performed on BAL fluid from immunocompromised patients at NYP/WCMC using standard procedures: Gram stain and bacterial culture, calcofluor white potassium hydroxide stain and fungal culture, acid-fast bacillus stain and mycobacterial culture, PCRs for Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, and Bordetella pertussis, Legionella direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) and culture, Pneumocystis jirovecii DFA, and Aspergillus galactomannan.",

Reverse transcription was performed on 10 \u03bcl of RNA using the Quanta cDNA kit with random primers (Quanta, Gaithersburg, MD). The viral protein 1 (VP1) gene sequence of HRV was initially targeted using PCR primers designed at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) (Unpublished, kindly provided by Dr. Dean Erdman). If this assay failed to produce a band for sequencing, a further assay with primers targeting a different region of the VP1 gene was used [7]. If the VP1 gene assays failed, the VP4 gene sequence was amplified with primers described in Coiras et al. [8]. PCR products were visualized on a 1.5% TAE gel, and purified using Affimetrix ExoZapIt on samples displaying the appropriate size products (Affimetrix Santa Clara, CA). Sequencing was performed using the PCR primers from each of the assays.",

            "text": "This study has several limitations. First, microbiologic data were captured at a single time point so we could not confirm that HRV infection preceded, and therefore, predisposed to cases of bacterial co-infection. Second, among patients with different HMs, there is considerable heterogeneity in host immunity due to underlying disease and chemotherapy that may have confounded our ability to isolate host factors associated with HRV LRTI. It is possible that the frequency of HRV was underestimated in our cohort given that most PCR assays are not able to detect all known HRVs [29]. Twenty (16%) respiratory specimens were not molecularly typed, usually due to low viral load. Additionally, despite the use of highly degenerate primers, extensive sequence variability in the regions targeted make universal typing of HRV challenging [30], [31].",
