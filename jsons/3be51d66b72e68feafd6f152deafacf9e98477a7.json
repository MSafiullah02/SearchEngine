The manifestations of sepsis are the same as those previously defined for SIRS, and sepsis is a result of SIRS from documented infection. It is a complex morbid state typically initiated by an infectious insult and associated with elevated levels of cytokines and other humoral/cellular mediators of inflammation, coagulation, and metabolic dysfunction (5) (6) (7) (8) .",

Seventy-seven patients with SARS were randomized to a treatment group (37 patients) and a control group (40 patients). The Chinese herbs used in the treatment group were Rhizoma Anemarrhenae, Gypsum Fibrosum, Radix Glycyrrhizae, Semen Pruni Armeniacae, Herba Ephedrae, Flos Lonicerae, Radix Ginseng, and Radix Salviae Miltiorrhizae, among which Rhizoma Anemarrhenae, Gypsum Fibrosum, and Radix Glycyrrhizae are the major components in BH. The results reported that the healing rate in the treatment group was 100%. In the control group, one patient died, and 39 patients were healed. After seven days of treatment, among the patients in the acute phase, in the control group, the average CD 4 + T cell count of 27 patients was lowered from 497\u00b1262 cells /\u03bcL to 377\u00b1190 cells/\u03bcL.",

As we addressed above, the acute illness (e.g., SIRS or sepsis) often causes hyperglycemia, and hyperglycemia in turn slows down the process of healing or in some cases even leads to a more severe situation, e.g., sepsis-associated organ failure via such mechanisms as impairing the immune function and worsening the inflammation.",

The increased counter-regulatory hormones and cytokines cause an increase in insulin resistance (61) , which is believed to be the major cause of hyperglycemia in septic and critically ill patients (42, 60, 62) . Since many studies have reported that BHG had obvious favorable outcomes in type \u2161 diabetes, which was caused by insulin resistance, it is possible that BHG lowers the blood glucose level through its effect of regulating the counter-regulatory hormone and the inflammatory cytokines, therefore, suppressing insulin resistance. This hypothesis and the detailed mechanism are yet to be investigated by future studies.",

            "text": "van den Berghe, et al (18) investigated the value of insulin therapy directed at maintaining strict glucose control in 1 500 patients admitted to ICU. The patients were randomized to receive intensive insulin therapy (continuous infusions to maintain blood glucose concentrations at 80-110 mg/dL) or conventional insulin therapy (infusion of insulin only if the blood glucose level exceeded 215 mg/dL and maintenance of glucose at a level between 180 and 200 mg/dL). Interim analysis at one year demonstrated a significant reduction in ICU mortality (4.6% vs 8.0%, P=0.036, with adjustment for sequential analysis) with continuous infusion. The mortality benefit was especially evident among patients requiring intensive care for >5 days (10.6 vs 20.2%, P=0.005). The greatest reduction in mortality involved deaths due to multiple-organ failure with a proven septic focus. Intensive insulin therapy also reduced overall inhospital mortality by 34%, bloodstream infections by 46%, acute renal failure requiring dialysis or hemofiltration by 41%, the median number of red-cell transfusions by 50%, and critical-illness polyneuropathy by 44%. Patients receiving intensive therapy were less likely to require prolonged mechanical ventilation and intensive care (18) . An analysis of the van den Berghe, et al (45) study in 2003 showed a linear correlation between the degree of hyperglycemia and the risk of death. It also showed that strict blood glucose control (<110 mg/dL) prevents morbidity effects such as acute renal failure, bacteremia, and anemia. Multivariate logistic regression analysis confirmed the independent role of blood glucose control in achieving most of the clinical benefits of intensive insulin therapy and underscored the importance of lowering the blood glucose level to strict normoglycemia (19) .Similar results were reported in a retrospective review of >1 800 critically ill medical and surgical patients. Patients whose mean glucose concentrations were maintained between 80 and 99 mg/dL had the lowest hospital mortality (9.6%). Mortality increased progressively with increases in mean glucose concentrations, and patients with mean blood glucose concentrations >300 mg/dL had the highest mortality (42.5%, P<0.001)(36)  .Although the underlying mechanisms of strictly controlling hyperglycemia with insulin therapy are yet unclear, the researches in the past decade clearly show that it substantially improves the outcome of critical illness. \"The days of ignoring blood sugar levels or tolerating marked hyperglycemia in the ICU (which was commonplace even five years ago, 2001) are over\"(43)  .",

            "text": "Previous studies on the mechanism of BH and BHG in treating SIRS have ignored an important function of these formulas: BH and BHG could lower the blood glucose concentration. It is very common in SIRS and sepsis patients to have hyperglycemia. Hyperglycemia used to be considered beneficial for survival in critical illness until a clinical study in 2001 showed that preventing even moderate hyperglycemia during critical illness substantially improved the outcome(18,19)  . Since then, numerous reports have shown that tight blood glucose control yielded favorable results in septic patients. In this paper, we review the studies of BH and BHG and the studies of contemporary treatment of SIRS and sepsis, and we try to explain the mechanism of BH and BHG from a new perspective. Considering the fact that BH and BHG are beneficial in the treatment of SIRS and sepsis and that they have great effect in lowering the blood glucose level, we hypothesize that one of the major roles that BH and BHG have in treating SIRS and sepsis is to maintain the blood glucose at the normal level.",
