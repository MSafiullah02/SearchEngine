SIR (Susceptible, Infected, Recovered) model has been widely used to analyse such diseases based on a mathematical model. After an outbreak of SARS, the first SIR model of SARS was published and many researchers studied the epidemic of the disease using this model. When an outbreak of a new type of influenza is first reported, the U.S. government immediately starts an emergency action plan to estimate parameters of its SIR model. Nevertheless, the SIR model has difficulty to analyse which measures are effective because the model has only one parameter to represent infectiveness. For example, it is difficult for the SIR model to evaluate the effect of temporary closing of classes because of the influenza epidemic. The agent-based approach or the individual-based approach has been adopted to conquer these problems in recent years [1\u20134]. The model enables to represent behaviour of each person. It also reveals the spread of an infection by simulation of the contact process among people in the model.",

Although our previous study described the infectious disease model of smallpox and Ebola [6], this paper proposes a new model of rubella which has caused crucial problems for pregnant women in recent years. In Sect. 2, as examples of infections that occurred in the past, we will explain smallpox, Ebola hemorrhagic fever, Zika fever and rubella. Section 3 describes related research on infectious disease models. Section 4 explains the basic model and describes the rubella model. Section 5 explains the experimental results and Sect. 6 discusses them. Finally, we summarize the whole in Sect. 7.",

The epidemic recurred in 2018, as of October the number of annual infections of rubella was about 1300 people, the National Institute of Infectious Diseases announced emergency information on rubella epidemics. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) raised the rubella alert level in Japan to the second \u2018recommendation\u2019 among the three levels [13].

This model was designed as an agent-based model, and then simulation of infectious disease was conducted using the model. As results of experiments showed that (1) in a base model in which any infectious disease measures were not taken, the epidemic spread within 82 days and 30% of people died, (2) a trace vaccination measure was effective but it was difficult to trace all contacts to patients in an underground railway or an airport, (3) a mass vaccination measure was effective, but the number of vaccinations would be huge so it was not realistic and (4) epidemic quenching was also effective, and reactive household trace vaccination along with pre-emptive vaccination of hospital workers showed a dramatic effect.",

In the model, one person was infected with smallpox virus at a shopping mall. They compared between a trace vaccination measure and a mass vaccination measure. As a result of simulation, it was found that the effect of trace vaccination dropped if the early stage of infection was high and the number of medical staff is small, while the effect of mass vaccination was stable. Therefore, timely and concentrate mass vaccination is required when virus starts spreading. The estimation about the number, place and time of infection is needed quickly and the preparation of an emergency medical treatment and estimation system is required for such occasions. Regarding measles epidemics, agent-based simulation models of measles transmission have been developed using the Framework for Reconstructing Epidemiological Dynamics, a data-driven agent-based model to simulate the spread of an airborne infectious disease in an Irish town, and so on [17, 18].",

In the past, vaccination was recommended for children under the age of 3, but due to the frequent occurrence of meningitis caused by the vaccine strains, the use was discontinued after that. Thereafter, the national epidemic of measles occurred mainly in the 10\u201320 generations in 2007. \u2018Prevention guideline on specific infectious diseases related to measles\u2019 was announced by the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, and rubella was also designated as a disease to take measures. And during the 5 years from 2008 to 2012, as a periodical inoculation at the first period (1-year-old child), the second period (before elementary school entrance), the third period (first grader of junior high school) and the fourth period (third grader of high school), MR vaccine was to be inoculated. From fiscal 2013, as a rule, measles\u2013rubella mixed (MR) vaccine is inoculated in infants of the first period and children before elementary school entrance of the second period. According to a survey of 2016, females possess about 95% of antibodies in all ages, while males only possess about 90% of 20\u201334 years old, and 76\u201384% of 35\u201355 years old. The antibodies holding rate in middle-aged males stays low.",
