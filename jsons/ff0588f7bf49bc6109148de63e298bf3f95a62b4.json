In this study, it was investigated whether CMV DNA is detected in the lower respiratory tract and the systemic compartment in pediatric patients with chronic or recurrent bronchopulmonary diseases. A total of 42 lower respiratory tract specimens and 11 paired plasma samples from 42 patients were analyzed for the presence of CMV DNA by real-time PCR. The respiratory specimens were also screened for the presence of respiratory viruses and human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) and 7 (HHV-7) by PCR methods. Quantitative bacterial and fungal cultures were performed. IL-6 levels in the respiratory specimens were quantified using ELISA. CMV DNA was detected either in the lower respiratory airways, in plasma, or both in 54.5% of CMV-seropositive patients. The levels of IL-6 were significantly higher in these patients than in those with no detectable levels of CMV DNA. HHV-6 and HHV-7 DNA were detected in three and one patients, respectively. Respiratory viruses were detected in 13 of the 42 patients. Significant growth of one or more bacterial species was observed in 17 patients. No significant association was found between the presence of CMV DNA and the detection of other microorganisms. The data indicated that the presence of CMV DNA in the lower respiratory tract is a frequent finding in children with chronic or recurrent bronchopulmonary diseases. Further, prospective observational studies are needed to assess the impact of this phenomenon, if any, on the clinical course of these patients.",

Nevertheless, recent data suggest that CMV may also be a relevant cause of morbidity in patients lacking canonical immunosuppression and displaying various inflammatory processes, including cardiovascular, autoimmune, and chronic bowel diseases [S\u00f6derberg-Naucl\u00e9r, 2008; N\u00fa \u00f1 ez et al., 2010 N\u00fa \u00f1 ez et al., , 2012 . In these patients, active CMV infection is detected frequently in either the inflamed tissues or even the blood compartment. Furthermore, active CMV infection, either restricted to the lower respiratory tract or involving both the lower respiratory airways and the systemic compartment, has been shown to occur frequently during critically illness in adult CMV-seropositive patients Blanquer et al., 2011] , and has been associated with prolonged intensive care unit hospitalization, extended periods of mechanical ventilation, higher rates of nosocomial infection, and overall mortality [for review, see Kalil and Florescu, 2009] . From a pathogenetic perspective, data obtained in the murine CMV model indicate that a pro-inflammatory state is a critical factor in promoting CMV replication [Cook et al., 2002] , and that TNF-a, a cytokine known to transactivate the expression of CMV immediate-early genes, plays a critical role in triggering CMV reactivation [Pr\u00f6sch et al., 1995] . In this context, active CMV infection may occur in pediatric patients with chronic or recurrent bronchopulmonary diseases in which inflammation plays potentially a major pathogenic role. The current study was undertaken to investigate this hypothesis.",

Patients had a previous history of chronic/recurrent lower tract respiratory symptoms and/or persistent/recurrent radiographic abnormalities (infiltrates, a telectasis, or air trapping images). Fibrobronchoscopies were performed between May 2009 and July 2011, either for primary diagnosis, for diagnosis re-evaluation in patients responding unsatisfactorily to conventional therapies or as a complementary diagnostic procedure or for assessing the eradication of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in cystic fibrosis patients with negative sputum cultures after a 1-year-long course of antibiotic therapy, according to local protocols. No patient had acute upper or lower respiratory tract signs or symptoms at the time of the fibrobronchoscopy. The patients had the following underlying bronchopulmonary conditions: atelectasis rounded or middle lobe syndrome (n \u00bc 14), cystic fibrosis (n \u00bc 11), bronchiectasis (n \u00bc 5), chronic asthma not responding to conventional treatments (n \u00bc 3), tracheomalacia (n \u00bc 3), bronchiolitis obliterans (n \u00bc 2), chronic interstitial pneumopathy (n \u00bc 2), bronchopulmonary dysplasia (n \u00bc 1), or bronchial hypoplasia (n \u00bc 1).

As the lungs are a major site of CMV latency [Cook et al., 2002] , it would be interesting to know the rate of CMV DNA detection in the lower respiratory tract in healthy CMV-seropositive children; It is highly unlikely though this being as high as that found in this study. Involvement of the systemic compartment was demonstrated in two of the six patients with detectable CMV DNA in the lower respiratory tract. Low CMV DNA loads were usually observed in both compartments. The above scenario resembles that seen in critically ill patients subjected to mechanical ventilation. In these patients, it was demonstrated that a rapid expansion of CMV-specific functional CD8 \u00fe T cells occurs upon CMV reactivation, keeping viral loads at low levels in both compartments and eventually controlling the episode Blanquer et al., 2011] .",

Despite the stable clinical condition of the patients at the time of fibrobronchoscopy, respiratory viruses were detected in almost one-third of the patients. Although contamination with viruses present in the upper respiratory tract could not be formally excluded, this feature is consistent with either a delayed clearance of a recent acute viral infection episode or with a persistent viral infection of the lower respiratory airways. The plausibility of the latter explanation is supported by data obtained in experimental animal models, and also in humans for respiratory syncytial virus, rhinovirus, and human metapneumovirus infections [Schwarze et al., 2004; Liu et al., 2009] . Persistent replication of these viruses in the lower respiratory tract induces inflammation [Papadopoulos et al., 2000] , and may thereby promote local CMV reactivation. In turn, CMV may also potentiate respiratory virus replication in the lower respiratory tract by virtue of its immunosuppressive capacity [Solano and Navarro, 2010] . Nevertheless, no significant association was found between the presence of CMV DNA in the lower respiratory tract and the occurrence of respiratory viruses. Likewise, the occurrence of active CMV infection in critically ill patients has been related to an increased incidence of bacterial and fungal super infection [Jaber et al., 2005; Chiche et al., 2009] . The current investigation also found no association between the presence of CMV DNA in the lower respiratory tract and the occurrence of bacterial or fungal species. However, this study was not specifically designed to investigate these potential pathogenic interactions, and so no definitive conclusions may be drawn on this issue.",
