Robust prediction of the trajectory of the death incidence curve is helpful for policy decisions during this ongoing crisis. We propose a non-parametric model to fit the number of daily deaths in a region, which hypothesizes that the death incidence curve will have a convex shape in the beginning, a concave shape near the peak, and a convex shape in the final stage of the death incidence curve after the peak. Using this, we performed robust short-term predictions on phases in five countries worldwide and five US states. Our analysis shows while the five states are all at peaks or past their peaks, US as a country is possibly not at peak yet. Our model can be easily fitted on daily death data from any region.",

A recent article by the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) reported USA's number of positive cases to peak during first two weeks of April [23] estimating a death toll of 80,000 in the next four months. The same group released a news article projecting that European countries will see their daily death peak during the third week of April [24] . However, both of these death projections have a very wide range of variability (95% CI 38,242-162,106 deaths in US) based on the major assumptions of social distancing in the model. A group of epidemiologists from Imperial College in UK reported a predicted death toll of 550,000 in UK and 2.2million in USA in absence of any social distancing .

Shortly after that report, they revised their estimate to 5,000 deaths in UK incorporating a perfect social distancing model. The disparity of these predictions highlights the sensitivity of these models on the underlying assumptions. The current global CFR for 2019-nCoV cases is 6.3%, however, Italy's CFR has been 12.82% whereas in South Korea it has been 2.1% [26] . This degree of variation in the observed CFR across countries is due to the difference in the age distribution, as well as possible overloading of the healthcare system [27] . It remains unclear how situation will progress over time because of dependence on many factors, which is why long term prediction on positive cases or transmission rates remain unreliable. A more tractable question is whether we can understand the short-term trajectory of 2019-nCoV in a robust way to aid in decision making by studying the DIC per region.",

Our non-parametric approach gives a robust fit despite of considerable variability in the number of cases on each day.

Italy has crossed its peak, i.e. case fatality in Italy has started declining. Within USA, some of the states have already reached their peaks. California as a state has been able to better contain the virus, as it had an early start and has already reached its peak, but has a lower total number of deaths per million compared to some of the other states (NY and NJ). Overall, since USA is at a mini peak, it seems that lockdown is working to slow down the rates of 2019-nCoV spread. However, since Asian countries are approaching a second one [35] , it is reasonable to think, for USA, we anticipate an increase in the number of deaths in the coming months.",

In the absence of widespread serological tests, currently there is debate on the percentage of asymptomatic cases in the population. Studies have reported vastly different asymptomatic cases, ranging from 51.4% [36] in Diamond princess ship and 87.9% [37] among pregnant women in New York. Variability in percentage of asymptomatic cases, long incubation period of the virus coupled with current testing on only symptomatic cases, incorporate bias in estimation of either the number of positive cases. On the other hand, there are studies [18] claiming that CFR underestimates the true mortality rate in the population due to the infection. Our analysis re-emphasizes that CFR is affected by multiple unknown factors such as disease prevalence [38] , testing rates, right censoring [18] , human behavior, that are challenging to account for. Thus, we chose number of daily new deaths as our statistic, and relied on a non-parametric model to predict short term behavior. Currently the existing predictions based on parametric modelling assumptions [25] produce estimates with a wide range of uncertainty, and the estimates change considerably over the span of few days, which can be problematic for policy decisions.",

Being able to predict the start and end of peak in DIC in a region is important for policy makers worldwide.

Since our model can be used to assess peaks in any region, it can be adapted easily to model country, state or county level data. A prolonged national lockdown can have a negative impact both for small and large businesses, leading to a financial crisis. In the efforts of reopening economy, our model can help to identify low-risk regions which are already past their peak.",

On January 27 th , China reported a DTT (death toll per thousand positive cases) of 11.35, and by February 16 th , the DTT decreased to 1.83. South Korea reported a DTT of 3.89 on February 24 th and dropped to 0.73 by March 7 th . USA reported a DTT of 20.20 on March 7 th and dropped to 5.01 March 11 th , 2020. Thus USA started with a higher DTT compared to China and South Korea, and then had a steeper drop. Italy started with a DTT of 14.70 on February 24 th dropped to 11 on March 3 rd and then rose up to 15.91 by March 15 th after which dropped gradually. Germany started the last among the five countries with a DTT of 0.70 on March 11 th , rose up to 2.05 by April 4 th and dropped to 1.89 after that. Italy and Germany both showed a trend of death toll rising after an initial drop in the curve. The initial drop in all countries could be partially accounted to increase in number of testing in each country. Data [31] show that on March 7 th USA reported 0.011 total tests being performed per thousand people, and by March 15 th it was 0.118 tests per thousand,which was approximately ten-fold increase in testing. By February 24 th South Korea was performing 0.558 tests per thousand people, and by March 7 th 2020, that increased to 3.476 tests, a 6.22-fold increase. This partially explains the steeper drop in death tolls in US compared to South Korea. Italy reported approximately 5.9-fold increase in testing between February 24 th and March 3 rd . By March 15 th , even though Italy increased the number of testing by 28 folds, we see an increase in DTT. This increase could be attributed by overload of their healthcare system[32]. Thus fromFigure 1, we learn that DTT can vary depending on various factors such as overload of healthcare system, number of testing performed, and others. This observation justifies our consideration to study daily deaths as compared to number of observed positive cases, or CFR (proportional to DTT).",
