The program calculates a score for each residue in a polyprotein. The score indicates the resemblance of each residue to that at the cleavage site of a typical Nterminal eucaryotic signal sequence. The program correctly predicts the known Nterminal signal sequence cleavage sites of several cellular and viral proteins. The analysis demonstrates that the polyproteins of enveloped RNA viruses-including the alphaviruses, flaviviruses, and bunyaviruses-contain several internal signalsequence-like regions. The predicted cleavage site in these internal sequences are often known cleavage sites for processing of the polyprotein and are amongst the highest scoring residues with this algorithm. These results indicate a role for the cellular enzyme signal peptidase in the processing of several viral polyproteins. Not all high-scoring residues are sites of cleavage, suggesting a difference between N-terminal and internal signal sequences. This may reflect the secondary structure of the latter. Signal sequences were also found at the N-termini of the fusion proteins of the paramyxoviruses and the retroviruses. This suggests a mechanism of viral fusion analogous to that by which proteins are translocated through the membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum at synthesis.",

Such messages are also produced by some genome segments of negative-sense RNA viruses (5) (6) (7) . The translated product of a viral polycistronic message must be processed by a viral or a cellular protease to yield the individual viral proteins. In the well-defined case of poliovirus, it is a viral protease. The single, large mRNA is translated in the cytoplasm to produce a single, large polyprotein, at least two parts of which have protease activity and cleave the polyprotein to its several constituent parts (8) . Similarly, the capsid protein of the alphaviruses has a protease activity and cleaves its own release from the translated polyprotein (9) . It is also likely that cellular proteases are involved in the processing of viral polyproteins; one possibility is signal peptidase.",

The signal sequence is removed by signal peptidase. The enzyme is present on the inner surface of the membranes of the ER. There are numerous reviews and hypotheses on the mechanisms involved in membranebound protein synthesis, translocation, and signal peptidase cleavage (11) (12) (13) . Nterminal signal sequences are present on the proteins translated from many monocistronic viral messages, for example, the hemagglutinin (HA) molecule of influenza virus (14) and the G protein of vesicular stomatitis virus (15, 16) . Translation of a viral polycistronic message coding for an N-terminal signal sequence will also take place on ER-bound ribosomes, with translocation of the extending polypeptide into the lumen of the ER. Just as signal peptidase cleaves the Nterminal signal sequence, so it may recognize and cleave other sites of similar specificity internally within polyprotein sequences. To examine this possibility, we have used a computer algorithm to scan the entire length of many viral polyproteins to determine the presence or absence of signal sequences. Several sequences analogous to N-terminal signal sequences were detected internally in viral polyproteins and also at the N-termini of some viral fusion proteins. We have examined known processing cleavage sites in these polyproteins and determined their similarity to signal-sequence cleavage sites. The results indicate a role for signal peptidase in the processing of many viral polyproteins.",

Very few residues within the polyprotein have a positive score (indicative of a signal-sequence cleavage site). The polyprotein is cleaved by protease activity of the capsid protein (C) at residue 964. An uncleaved signal sequence is present at the N-terminus of the precursor p62 protein, with a high score at residue 282. P62 is cleaved to E3 and E2 at residue 328, a basic residue cleavage site with a negative score. Cleavages either side of the 6 kD nonstructural protein after residues 751 and 806 give high scores, and are likely to be produced by signal peptidase. port of this, translation studies in cell-free systems demonstrate that cleavage at these sites is associated with the activity of a membrane-bound protease. If no membranes are present in the translation system, a large polyprotein containing p62-4kD-El is produced (45) .

Many putative viral proteins have been observed in infected cells, and it has proved difticult to determine how many proteins are coded for on the message and how they are processed. N-terminal amino-acid sequencing of some of the proteins has determined their position, but, with the exception of Kunjin virus (51), this has not been possible for all the nonstructural proteins.

In addition, if yellow fever virus follows the strategy of Kunjin virus, then residue 123 is probably a signal peptidase cleavage site yielding the Nterminus of Pre-M ( Table 3 ). The C-terminal region of M is also signal-sequencelike, and the known site of cleavage (52) between M and E has the third highest score on the polyprotein. The known cleavage (52) residue 778 is at another high-scoring site. Cleavage between NSl and NS2a has been suggested (48) to occur after residue 1187. This site has a positive but low score (Table 3) . Residue 1178 has a higher score (Table 3) is nine residues Nterminal of the suggested cleavage site and is a more likely signal-peptidase cleavage site in this region. Cleavage at the N-terminus of the putative nonstructural 2b, 4a, and 4b proteins is suggested (48, 53) to follow pairs of arginine residues (RR), as found at the cleavage site at the known N-terminus of NS3. With the exception of the cleavage at the N-terminus of 4b, this would be consistent with the situation in Kunjin virus (5 1). An alternative signal-sequence cleavage site after residue 2256 or 2385 could generate the N-terminus of NS4b (Table 3) . Residue 2256 has a higher score and is the more likely cleavage site. Residue 2385 is nine residues N-terminal from the proposed (48,53) basic residue site. It is also worth noting (Table 3 ) two other highscoring residues: Residue 1352 is two residues away from the suggested basic residue cleavage site between NS2a and NS2b, and residue 1481 if four residues Nterminal from the known N-terminal of NS3.",

The S segment has no requirement for the processing of a polyprotein. The large L RNA segment codes for the viral polymerase (56) which is as yet unsequenced. The middle-sized M RNA codes for a polyprotein containing two envelope glycoproteins and a nonstructural protein (5760). There is a requirement for processing of this M polyprotein. It is possible that any of the nonstructural proteins from the S, M, or L segments could encode a protease responsible for the cleavage of the M polyprotein. However, translation of M RNA in cell-free systems demonstrates only a requirement for microsomal membranes (61, 62) . Table 4 shows the known cleavage sites of the M polyproteins of viruses representative of three different genera. In each case, the known cleavage sites are among the highest scoring sites on the polyprotein. In the case of Punta Toro and Rift Valley fever viruses, the two documented cleavage sites are the tirst and second highest scoring sites on the whole 1440-residue polyprotein. It is likely that signal peptidase is responsible for cleavage at all the sites indicated in Table 4 , except for the cleavage site at the C-terminal position of the tirst envelope glycoprotein of snowshoe hare virus. This follows an arginine residue, has a negative score, and is probably mediated by a cellular trypsin-like enzyme (65 signal-sequence-like region preceding the Gl protein of Rift Valley fever virus, as with those preceding the p62 and El proteins of the alphaviruses, not only provides a cleavage site, but is also functional in membrane insertion and translocation (62).",

N-terminal signal sequences are cleaved by the cellular enzyme signal peptidase, the activity of which is associated with the membranes of the ER. Similarly, in-vitro translation studies have demonstrated requirement of microsomal membranes for the correct processing of some viral polyproteins (41, 43, 46, 61, 62) . Indeed, it has previously been suggested that internal signal sequences function as cleavage sites in the processing of viral polyproteins (37, 38, 47, 48) . However, there has been no previous attempt to determine the number of signal-sequence-like regions on a viral polyprotein, nor to determine how closely known processing cleavage sites on a viral polyprotein resemble those in the N-terminal signal sequences of cellular proteins. The results from our computer study, based on the method of von Heijne (l), demonstrate that regions of primary sequence characteristic of the N-terminal signal sequences of eucaryotic preproteins are present internally within the polyproteins of enveloped RNA viruses. In many cases, the internal processing cleavage sites of viral polyproteins closely resemble cleavage sites in the N-terminal signal sequences of cellular preproteins. These tindings support the suggestion that the cellular enzyme, signal peptidase, is involved in the processing of viral polyproteins. Our results also demonstrate the presence of signalsequence-like sequences at the N-termini of certain known viral fusion proteins. This suggests a possible mechanism of viral fusion analogous to that whereby newly synthesized proteins are inserted into and translocated through the internal cell membranes.",

On infection of a new cell, likely candidates for a receptor recognizing an N-terminal signal-sequence-like fusion region would be that component of the SRP responsible for signal sequence recognition, a translocation channel similar to that through which an extending polypeptide is translocated into the ER, the receptor component of such a channel, or even the signal peptidase enzyme.
