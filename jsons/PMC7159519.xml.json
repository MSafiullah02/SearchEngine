The goals of pretransplant infectious disease screening are: (1) to identify conditions which disqualify either donor or recipient, (2) to identify and treat active infection pretransplant, (3) to define the level of infection risk in order to determine strategies for preventing post\u2010transplant infection. Although there is general agreement on the major infections for which screening is performed, there is some variation between centers in types of screening utilized and actions taken as a result.",

This will aid in reinforcing information and updating the patient regarding newer risks and recommendations.

The risk for transmission to nonhepatic recipients appears to be low but not zero; this risk can be further diminished by pretransplant HBV vaccination of the recipient (2, 11, 52, 54). Some centers restrict the use of such organs to life\u2010threatening situations and/or vaccinated recipients, or would utilize posttransplant prophylaxis with hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) and/or lamivudine if transplanted into a nonimmune recipient (BII) (11). Because of the possibility of being offered such an organ, it is prudent to vaccinate all seronegative transplant candidates with HBV vaccine, although the response to this vaccine in patients with end\u2010stage organ disease may be suboptimal (55) (AII).

Western blot testing should be obtained for confirmation of any positive screening test for either HIV\u20101 or 2. Where doubt exists as to a possible exposure for a potential living donor who is HIV seronegative, a molecular viral test should be obtained, which will be positive prior to the development of a positive antibody test. The use of rapidly available molecular testing for HIV is also desirable for deceased donors when this technology becomes available.",

HTLV\u2010II is a virus which is serologically difficult to distinguish from HTLV\u2010I, although its association with disease processes is less certain. PCR assays can be used to distinguish HTLV\u2010I and II if necessary to do so. HTLV\u2010I seropositive donors are generally not utilized, although use of such donors could be considered for a life\u2010threatening situation, particularly in an older recipient, with stringent informed consent (5) (CIII).

In the fall of 2002, the CDC's investigation of transmission of WNV by transplantation to four organ recipients of a single donor was reported (73), and additional reports of transmission by blood transfusion and liver transplantation have appeared (74). It is unclear as yet what the magnitude of the risk of such transmission is, and the pattern of WNV activity is changing on a yearly basis. Serology and PCR for WNV are available but time\u2010consuming. It is prudent to avoid any donor who has had an unexplained, possibly viral illness and/or unexplained mental status changes. Since July 2002, all US blood bank products have been tested for WNV using the investigational nucleic acid amplification test (NAT) which is performed at specific centers. In the fall of 2003, the US Health Resources and Service Administration (HRSA) issued a guidance statement regarding donors and WNV, which recommended testing all prospective live donors with the NAT test close to the time of transplant; avoiding donors with any form of encephalitis; and heightened clinical suspicion on the part of the treating clinician with any febrile illness occurring shortly after transplant. Because of the time currently required to transport samples to centers performing the NAT test, testing of deceased donors is not yet universally recommended, but may be voluntarily undertaken by organ procurement organizations in conjunction with laboratories performing the NAT test. In parts of Canada, testing of donors for WNV IgM as well as the NAT test is being performed.",

There is a risk of transmission to health care workers as well as household contacts of affected individuals, and there has been at least one death of a transplant recipient due to SARS. Updated information on SARS epidemiology, infection control, and related topics can be found on the CDC website at http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/sars and Health Canada's website at http://www.hc-sc.ca/english/sars. While transmission by transplantation is theoretically possible, the extent of this risk is unknown. Current principles of donor and recipient selection would likely exclude patients with recent acute illnesses meeting SARS criteria; however, the consequences of a more remote history of SARS, or a subclinical illness, are unknown. Screening tools for potential adult and pediatric donors have been proposed and are evolving (University of Toronto Transplant Programs, D. Kumar, A. Humar, and U.
