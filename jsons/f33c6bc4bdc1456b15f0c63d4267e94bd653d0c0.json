PCR assays were used to amplify the DNA of adenovirus, Chlamydia spp, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae [Couroucli et al., 2000] . The HBoV NP-1 gene was detected by PCR using the primers 188 F (GAGCTCTGTAAGTACTATTAC) and 542 R (CTCTGTGTTGACTGAATACAG) and the same reactions and thermal cycler programme as described and corrected subsequently by Allander et al. [Allander et al., 2005] to detect a 345-bp product. One-third of the HBoV amplicons were sequenced to confirm the identity of the virus (Lark Technologies, Essex, UK).",

This higher frequency however could also reflect the sampling technique used, as samples for admitted patients were collected using Nasopharyngeal aspirates while ambulatory patients were tested with throat swabs, and further studies would be required to confirm these findings.

However, as acute respiratory infections in general mostly affect young children [Bryce et al., 2005] , it is not surprising that most of the children with HBoV had this age distribution. Interestingly, different to RSV, which affects mostly children <6 months of age [Constantopoulos et al., 2002] , HBoV seems to affect slightly older children, as has been observed with HMPV [Al-Sonboli et al., 2005] .",

Co-infections with other respiratory viruses have been observed in previous studies [Allander et al., 2005; Bastien et al., 2006; Ma et al., 2006; Sloots et al., 2006 ] and a relatively high proportion of co-infections is reported in this study (33%). This noticeable proportion of co-infections needs to be further elucidated as it might suggest that HBoV is an incidental finding without a significant role in the causation of acute respiratory infections or, as suggested for HMPV [Greensill et al., 2003] , it might play a role modifying the clinical presentation of children who have co-infections with other viruses.",
