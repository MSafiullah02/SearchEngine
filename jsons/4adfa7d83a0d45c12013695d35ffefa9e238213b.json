            "text": "Lower respiratory infection (LRI) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, especially in children [1] . Upper respiratory infection (URI), although inherently less serious, nonetheless carries significant societal costs in terms of lost work and school days, and accounts for a large number of health care visits, including unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions. Thus, determining the etiologic agents of these common infections has been the subject of much important research. Decades of epidemiologic studies have established the importance of known viral pathogens such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza viruses (PIVs), influenza virus, coronaviruses, and rhinoviruses [2, 3] . However, these studies have been unable to identify a specific virus in over 50% of such infections, using traditional methods of viral culture, serology, and newer rapid antigen assays. Previously it was unknown whether these represented infections with known viruses that were not detected by existing assays, or unknown agents. Therefore, the report of a novel paramyxovirus, human metapneumovirus (hMPV), associated with respiratory tract disease by Dutch researchers in 2001 [4\u2022\u2022] was a major finding for the field of respiratory virus research. The speed and efficiency with which subsequent studies have elucidated the epidemiology and biology of hMPV illustrate the capabilities of modern medical science.",

            "text": "The Dutch group collected a number of unidentified virus isolates, mostly from children, over a 20-year period that grew poorly in cell culture with minimal cytopathic effects (CPEs). The virus isolates could not be identified by hemagglutination and immunofluorescence assays typically used to identify common viruses such as RSV, influenza virus, and PIV. Electron micrograph and biochemical studies of the virus showed that it was pleomorphic with a lipid envelope, consistent with a paramyxovirus. Elegant reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) experiments yielded extensive genetic sequences from the virus that clearly identified it as a member of the paramyxovirus family, which contains many important human viruses (Table 1 ). The gene order and putative open reading frames of the new virus were most closely related to avian pneumovirus, the sole known member of the metapneumovirus genus. Avian pneumovirus, discovered in 1979, is a major agricultural pathogen, causing severe respiratory disease in chickens and turkeys, and ensuing economic losses. However, the new hMPV was unable to infect chickens and turkeys, and combined with sequence comparison, this showed that it was a distinct human pathogen. The same group of investigators also conducted serologic assays on 192 archived human sera from 1958 and found that 100% of specimens from patients aged older than 5 years were seropositive for hMPV, suggesting a Human metapneumovirus is a paramyxovirus that was discovered in 2001 in the Netherlands. Epidemiologic studies have shown it to be a major cause of acute respiratory tract disease in normal infants and children worldwide, with a seasonal occurrence and spectrum of clinical illness most similar to the closely related respiratory syncytial virus. The greatest prevalence of severe disease requiring hospitalization in otherwise healthy children appears to be in those aged between 6 and 12 months, older than the peak age of hospitalizations for respiratory syncytial virus. Human metapneumovirus is also a significant cause of acute respiratory disease in adults, particularly the elderly and those with comorbid conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, and cancer. Because there is no rapid diagnostic assay, reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction is most widely used. Animal models have been developed, and candidate live-attenuated vaccines are in preclinical trials, offering the potential for future interventions in high-risk groups.",

            "text": "Human metapneumovirus has a negative-sense, singlestranded RNA genome like other paramyxoviruses, with a lipid envelope containing membrane proteins. The hMPV genome contains open reading frames analogous to all those of the most closely related human virus RSV, except the nonstructural genes NS1 and NS2, which have been shown to modulate host interferon response. The effect of these genes' absence on hMPV pathogenesis is not yet known, but studies will likely also help more fully elucidate their role in RSV pathogenesis. Partial gene sequences for many hMPV strains worldwide are now available, and phylogenetic analysis of these sequences defines two major genetic subgroups of hMPV, A and B, each with two minor subgroups (Fig. 1) . These are defined presently as genogroups; it has not been shown in humans that they are antigenically distinct. The fusion (F) protein, the major protective antigen for other paramyxoviruses, is highly conserved in hMPV, with 93% to 95% amino acid identity between major subgroups and approximately 97% amino acid identity within subgroups. In contrast, the glycoprotein (G), another major immune target in other paramyxo-viruses, is only 30% to 35% conserved between major subgroups of hMPV, and 70% within subgroups. In one large prospective study, primary infection during infancy was associated with LRI and subsequent URIs, demonstrating that reinfection with hMPV occurs [5\u2022\u2022] . It is not clear whether this is entirely attributed to infections with different subgroups that do not induce cross-protective immunity, or more likely, as is the case with RSV, to partial immunity induced by primary infection that protects the lower but not the upper respiratory tract against subsequent infection. There are no definitive data in humans to show that infection with a virus from one subgroup can protect against reinfection with a virus from a different subgroup. However, animal studies of the antigenic diversity between hMPV subgroups suggest that there is cross-protective immunity in hamsters and primates that protects the lungs against reinfection [6, 7] . These studies have important implications for the development of candidate vaccines and prophylactic antibodies against hMPV similar to palivizumab, a monoclonal antibody licensed for immunoprophylaxis against RSV for premature infants at high risk for severe disease.",

            "text": "Human metapneumovirus has been associated with a variety of respiratory symptoms and diagnoses. Children with hMPV infection typically present with upper respiratory symptoms such as rhinorrhea, cough, and fever. The duration of symptoms before seeking medical attention is usually less than 1 week, and most children shed virus for approximately 2 weeks [5\u2022\u2022, 10, 19] . Nonrespiratory symptoms such as conjunctivitis, vomiting, diarrhea, or rash are occasionally reported but are not prominent in most studies. Only one study in Italy found evidence by RT-PCR of hMPV in patients' serum [14] , suggesting that like RSV, hMPV infection is limited to the respiratory tract. The clinical LRI syndromes most frequently associated with hMPV are bronchiolitis, croup, pneumonia, and asthma exacerbation. In the Tennessee study of previously healthy outpatients, the hMPV-infected children were diagnosed with bronchiolitis (59%), croup (18%), asthma (14%), and pneumonia (8%) [5\u2022\u2022] . However, in that prospective study, hMPV was less likely to be associated with croup than was PIV, and less likely to be associated with pneumonia than was influenza virus. A similar spectrum of diagnoses is seen in most studies of LRI associated with hMPV, and hMPV infection overlaps clinically with other common respiratory viruses sufficiently so that reliable distinction cannot be made at the bedside. In a study of over 2400 distinct episodes of URI in previously healthy outpatient children, hMPV was associated with URI at rates similar to RSV, PIV, and influenza virus (Williams et al., Unpublished data). Fifty percent of the hMPV-infected children were diagnosed with acute otitis media (AOM), suggesting that hMPV is associated with a substantial proportion of AOM in otherwise healthy children. AOM is the most common indication for antibiotic prescriptions in outpatient children, and URI and AOM have significant economic impacts due to time lost from school and work. Thus, hMPV likely has substantial medical and economic effects nationally. The only published study to directly examine the societal impact of hMPV was an Italian study of 42 hMPV-infected children seen in the emergency department in which questionnaires were administered to patients' parents [26] . In 12% of patients' households, other family members had similar illnesses. Parents reported a median of 4 lost working days (range 2-10), and older children reported median 4 lost school days (range 3-15). These rates were similar to those of children infected with RSV or influenza virus in the same study population.",

The virus only grows in certain cell lines and requires trypsin for replication in culture, conditions that are not routinely used in diagnostic virology laboratories. These are presumed to be the reasons why hMPV was not detected earlier. Furthermore, even under ideal conditions, CPEs produced by hMPV in cell culture are minimal and do not appear until several weeks of incubation. Unlike RSV and influenza virus, there is no commercially available rapid antigen test for hMPV. Thus, the diagnosis of hMPV currently rests on molecular techniques based on standard or real-time RT-PCR, several of which have been published and are quite sensitive, although labor-intensive and time-consuming [30,31,32\u2022] .",

An Australian study of outpatient children with asthma did not find an association between hMPV and asthma exacerbations [33] , although a large prospective study of 2000 outpatient children found a highly significant association between hMPV and the diagnosis of acute asthma exacerbation [5\u2022\u2022] . A Finnish study found increased interleukin (IL)-8 in nasal secretions from hMPV-infected infants [34] , whereas another study from Argentina found decreased IL-8 and other cytokines in nasal washes of hMPV-infected infants, compared with infants infected with RSV [35] . All such studies are complicated by the difficulty of assigning the diagnosis of asthma during infancy, when acute wheezing associated with viral infections is common. Although all open reading frames in the hMPV genome are analogous to those in RSV, two nonstructural RSV proteins that are thought to modulate host immune response are not present in the hMPV genome. This provides a unique opportunity to study the immunopathogenesis of two otherwise closely related viruses, which may elucidate their association with asthma.",

The 17-month-old patient had had another unexplained LRI 1 year previously during chemotherapy for leukemia. Postmortem RT-PCR on respiratory samples from both illnesses detected hMPV in both, but from two distinct strains. Studies my colleagues and I are conducting in adult and pediatric patients with cancer, including HSCT recipients, suggest that hMPV is a relatively common cause of acute respiratory infection in these patients, with significant morbidity and mortality (Williams et al., Unpublished data) . A report of hMPV infection in African infants found no clinical differences between the three infants who were HIV-infected and the 10 who were not, although the authors cautioned that this may have been attributed to the small number of patients [38] . Further longterm prospective studies are needed to fully characterize the extent and severity of disease caused by hMPV in immunocompromised hosts.",

A few studies of hospitalized patients with hMPV have noted much higher coinfection rates of 30% to 60% [15, 34, 39, 40] , with some of these authors suggesting that hMPV infections may be more severe if another virus is present. One British group addressed this question by using a nested RT-PCR assay to test bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid from 30 intubated infants with RSV infection and detected hMPV in 21 of 30 patients (70%) [41] . The authors subsequently used the same nested assay to test respiratory specimens from children admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) and the general wards. hMPV and RSV coinfection was detected in 18 of 25 (72%) PICU patients and 15 of 171 (9%) general ward patients [42] . The detection rate for hMPV was much higher in BAL than in nasopharyngeal aspirate samples. The authors concluded that dual infection with RSV and hMPV was associated with severe bronchiolitis. However, a Connecticut study of 46 inpatients with mild or severe RSV disease found no coinfections with hMPV [43] . It is unknown whether these conflicting findings are attributed to methodologic differences or geographic variability in circulating virus strains. It is clear that further prospective studies are needed to clarify the nature of disease associated with coinfections.",

One group recently showed that ribavirin and polyclonal human immunoglobulin possessed in vitro neutralizing activity against hMPV equivalent to their activity against RSV [47] . There are no published animal or human data for these interventions, and although they may be shown to be worthy of consideration in severely immunocompromised hosts with LRI caused by hMPV, it is unlikely they will be used in more routine cases of hMPV infection, for the same reasons they are not used routinely for RSV.

However, the generation of stably attenuated, well-characterized strains of RSV has been difficult. The development of reverse genetic techniques to generate recombinant RSV was a major breakthrough, allowing the incorporation of specific mutations or even entire genes into recombinant viruses. These techniques have now been developed for hMPV. One group developed a recombinant chimeric bovine/human PIV vaccine that expressed hMPV F and was immunogenic and protective against challenge with hMPV in hamsters [48] . The National Institutes of Health group that initially described reverse genetics for RSV has generated recombinant hMPV strains lacking the small hydrophobic (SH) or glycoprotein (G) genes, or both [49] . Strains lacking the G gene were attenuated in hamsters, as measured by significantly lower virus titers in nose and lungs. Viruses lacking G, SH, or both were immunogenic in hamsters, induced high levels of neutralizing antibodies, and protected against challenge with wild-type hMPV. Thus, several potential vaccine candidates are in development within 3 years of the discovery of hMPV-a remarkable achievement.",

            "text": "Human metapneumovirus is a novel paramyxovirus that is an important cause of respiratory infections in adults and children worldwide. Although recently discovered, it clearly has been circulating for at least 50 years and presumably much longer. hMPV is a seasonal virus, with a peak incidence from late winter to early spring in temperate zones. Most infections are common URI, with a high proportion of concomitant otitis media in children. hMPV causes LRI in children and adults, typically bronchiolitis, croup, or pneumonia. LRI associated with hMPV is more common in males, and the peak age of hospitalization is between 6 and 12 months, older than the peak age of hospitalization for RSV. Clinically, hMPV infection most resembles RSV infection, and like RSV, patients can be reinfected with similar or novel strains. Although previously healthy children are hospitalized with hMPV infection, it appears that more severe disease generally occurs in patients with underlying chronic disease. Fatal infection has occurred in severely immunocompromised patients with cancer. Animal models exist to study pathogenesis, and candidate vaccines are in development.",
