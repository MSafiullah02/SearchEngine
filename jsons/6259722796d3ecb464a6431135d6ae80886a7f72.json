In response, pooled testing has emerged as a promising strategy that can immediately 13 increase testing capacity. Here, we provide support for the adoption of sample pooling with the point-of-care 14 Cepheid Xpert \u00ae Xpress SARS-CoV-2 molecular assay. Corroborating previous findings, the Xpert \u00ae Xpress SARS-15 CoV-2 assay limit of detection was comparable to central laboratory reverse-transcription quantitative PCR tests 16 with observed SARS-CoV-2 detection below 100 copies/mL. The Xpert \u00ae Xpress assay detected SARS-CoV-2 after 17 samples with minimum viral loads of 461 copies/mL were diluted into six sample pools. Based on these data, we 18 recommend the adoption of pooled testing with the Xpert \u00ae Xpress SARS-CoV-2 assay where warranted by 19 population public health needs. The suggested number of samples per pool, or pooling depth, is unique for each 20 point-of-care test site and should be determined by assessing positive test rates.

            "text": "Another pooling strategy proposed by the German Red Cross Blood Donor Service and Geothe University 171 is swab pooling, or the mini-pool method (16). Multiple swabs can be combined into a single tube at the point of 172 collection, rather than the traditional method of pooling transport media or extracted RNA. As a result, there is 173 minimal loss of sensitivity as no dilution is occurring. The main disadvantage of this approach is that the pooled 174 samples need to be collected simultaneously and at the same location; however, the swab pool approach could be 175 applied in certain scenarios. For example, this strategy may be appropriate for door-to-door household testing, 176 workplace screening, or its intended of purpose of blood donor screening. This approach could easily be combined 177 with traditional pooling to substantially increase testing capacity with the Xpert \u00ae Xpress SARS-CoV-2 assay or other 178 validated molecular test method.",
