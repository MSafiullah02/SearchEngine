Owing to the high procurement costs and sale prices of the housing products, the prosperity of the industry depends very much on the availability of finance for house building and home purchase. Except for places such as Hong Kong, Singapore, and Japan, house-building industries in most parts of the Asia-Pacific region have a relatively short history as real estate markets in these countries have only become fully formed in the last 20 years or so, and, often, only in major cities. Compared with North America and Western Europe, house-building industries in the Asia-Pacific region have been developing very fast in the past two decades. The growth of these industries has given momentum to economic development in the region because of the eco nomic activities opened for hundreds of upstream and downstream industries.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "The Asian Financial Crisis in late 1997 and the out break of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome in 2003 severely hit the industry in the region. Afterwards, INSTITUTIONS however, real estate and construction sectors recovered very strongly. Recent skyrocketing house prices point to an overheating in housing markets in various countries. For example, the ratio of the total house value to gross domestic product (GDP) in China in 2003 was about 2.3. It increased sharply to 3.3 in 2009. Over the period between 2002 and 2008, the average house price in South Korea increased by almost 60%.

At that time, the investor's confidence in Japan's economy accelerated business expansion, increased corporate earnings, and boosted personal income pushing up the house prices. However, the country entered its 'Lost Decade' after the bubble burst, and the house-building industry was severely hit. The recession of the industry continued in the 2000s. Construction investment turned sluggish, and the share of construction industry in the GDP decreased gradually from 7.4% in 2000 to 6.1% in 2007. The value of housing construction contracts dropped from 2840 billion yen in 1995 to 2641 billion yen in 2000, and further to 2441 billion yen in 2007. Similar declines were also experienced in the numbers of establishments and employees in the construction indus try. The number of employees in the industry in 2008 was 5.4 million which is 17.8% less than in 2000, and the number of establishments also fell from 607 000 in 2001 to 549 000 in 2006. As shown in Table 2 , housing con struction started in 2009 amounted to 788 410 units or 72.5 million square metres. The market has been recently dominated by private-sector projects. Although reinforced concrete (with and without steel frames) gained popularity in the mid-2000s, wooden structures still remain the most common structural form for housing construction. Given the downturn in the housing market, the con struction business is highly competitive. Yet, the Japanese construction industry is still among the most developed in the world. The industry has been renowned for its innovative construction techniques and designs (e.g., earthquake-resistant and green build ing designs), uncompromising quality control, and zealous commitment to research and development. Owing to their experience and expertise, many large Japanese construction companies have been increasingly placed in the world spotlight. They have built houses in other fast-growing regions in different parts of the world, including Europe, the Middle-east, Southeast Asia, the United States, and Greater China.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1114, "end": 1121, "text": "Table 2", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}], "section": "Japan"}, {"text": "In spite of the Asian Financial Crisis in 1997, the housing bubble reinflated quickly in South Korea in the early 2000s. Generally speaking, there are two reasons under lying the price hike. First, housing development in South Korea has lagged economic development. The everincreasing demand was not met by market supply, push ing up house prices. Second, housing construction in South Korea has been shaped, in the context of repressive government financial policy, by speculative investment practices.

During the housing boom, the Korean govern ment took some initiatives to meet people's housing demand and need. For example, in redevelopment projects, developers are required to provide a prescribed minimum amount of small-sized housing units. In the period between 2003 and 2012, a total of 1 million longterm public rental housing units were scheduled for con struction in order to address the housing problems of lower-income people.

Private developers must hold a Housing Developer's License in order to carry out housing developments with more than four dwelling units, pursuant to the 'Housing Developers (Control and Licensing) Act'. To obtain the license, developers have to fulfil certain require ments, like provide a minimum paid-up capital of SGD100 000.

The total floor space of commercialised housing sold rose by 3.6 times, from 130.0 million square metres in 1999 to 592.8 million square metres in 2008. The growth is estimated to be 7.6 times in terms of total revenue. In the 1980s, the Chinese construction industry was rather primitive. No building codes governed building product specification, design, and construction. Moreover, nearly all construction enterprises were directly supervised by the central ministries or municipal governments. Construction work projects were assigned by the authorities rather than being acquired through competitive bidding. That is why the construction indus try in mainland China was regarded as a single large enterprise with a centralised hierarchical organisation where factors of production and other resources were almost exclusively realised through administrative chan nels.

The industry has since become more market-based. Table 5 indicates that the numbers of state-owned and collective-owned construction enterprises declined in the period between 1999 and 2008. The industry employed 33.1 million people, about 4.3% of the total labour force in 2008.

To encourage homeownership among bumiputera and promote greater interaction among the various ethnic groups living in Malaysia, the Malaysian government introduced the National Economic Policy in the 1970s. Under that policy, housing developers in Malaysia have been required to set aside at least 30% of the completed housing units for the bumiputera and offer a discount of 5-15% to them. In spite of its social objectives, this policy has resulted in large inefficiencies in the local housing delivery system.
