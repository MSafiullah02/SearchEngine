Antimicrobial therapy plays an essential role in combating invasive infections in the intensive care population that are often the ultimate cause of death. However, a parallel evolution of microbial compensation occurs, engendering resistance and virulence mechanisms to circumvent each new antimicrobial agent\u2014penicillin resistance existed before the drug became commercially available. The surgical intensive care unit provides the ultimate microcosm for antimicrobial resistance development, juxtaposing complex and severe underlying illness with invasive devices, bypassed defenses, and compromised tissues, as well as proximity to other high-risk patients, all in one intimate environment. New resistance mechanisms may be introduced from referring institutions or can emerge in response to therapeutics, and then may spread to others within or outside the ICU. Multidrug-resistant organisms, promoted by excessive or suboptimal antimicrobial use, have become a dominant concern in modern healthcare, most notably in the intensive care setting; a directed, judicious, but strategic response is essential to both short- and long-term success.",

This may include removal of invasive devices or foreign bodies, percutaneous or operative drainage of abscesses, or lavage of septic arthritis or generalized peritonitis. Perforation of the gastrointestinal tract requires drainage and ultimately, repair or creation of a fistula, as persistent drainage coupled with ongoing antimicrobial therapy is a perfect recipe for in vivo development of resistance. Collaboration between critical care, infectious disease, interventional radiology, and surgical teams is ideal [9]. Infectious disease consultation, particularly when initiated early in the course, has been shown to improve antimicrobial utilization and adherence to guidelines, mechanical ventilation days [10], 30-day mortality and readmission, hospital and ICU length of stay, and costs [10, 11].",

Many patients who report allergy to penicillins do not react when re-challenged. Delineating the manifestations of purported allergy is valuable, as misattributed allergy relegates patients to alternate, and in many cases inferior, agents. In the past, crossover allergy to cephalosporins was estimated to occur in 7\u201314 % of patients with penicillin allergy, yet Pichichero estimates that this occurs only rarely, in about 0.5 % of those receiving first-generation cephalosporins and almost never with upper generation cephalosporins [59, 60]. Therefore, cephalosporins can be safely used in most patients reporting penicillin allergy, unless there is history of an immunoglobulin E-mediated reaction, such as anaphylaxis or angioedema. Cross-reactivity between penicillins and carbapenems is controversial, with previous estimates ranging from 0 to 50 %, but of uncertain significance in clinical practice. In a study of 104 patients with IgE-mediated reactions to penicillin confirmed by skin tests, only 1 (0.9 %) had an IgE-mediated reaction to meropenem; the other 103 tolerated escalating doses without adverse effects [61].",

            "text": "William Halsted, operating in the pre-antibiotic era of the late nineteenth century, identified the principles of asepsis and hemostasis as elements of surgical technique that would minimize infection. He advocated the use of sharp dissection and fine sutures, gentle handling of tissues, and complete wound closure [66]. Over a century later, perioperative antimicrobial prophylaxis is a vital adjunctive measure to these mainstays of infection prevention. Although the details of prophylaxis for elective surgery are altered in emergent operations on previously hospitalized ICU patients, the principles remain. The purpose of prophylaxis is to prevent intrinsic and extrinsic bacterial contamination of the surgical site that occurs during an operation from developing into a postoperative infection. The ideal prophylactic agent would be active against the major potential infecting agents; not induce resistance; effectively penetrate relevant tissues; have a long enough half-life to maintain effective levels throughout the procedure (re-dosing as necessary); have low toxicity and potential for allergy; have few interactions with anesthetic agents and muscle relaxants; and be cost effective [56, 67, 68]. It should be administered within an hour before the procedure (within 2 h for vancomycin and fluoroquinolones) [69]. Postoperative doses provide no added benefit. In a review of 28 studies there was no clear advantage to either multiple- or single-dose prophylaxis (odds ratio 1.06, 95 % CI, 0.89\u20131.25) [70]. Furthermore, unnecessary postoperative doses may cause harm, including allergy or anaphylaxis, prolonged bleeding times, C. difficile colitis, and selection of resistant organisms. This isparticularly important in surgical ICU patients, who may require prolonged care and risk progressive acquisition of multidrug-resistant organisms [71]. Similarly, \u201cprophylaxis\u201d of drains, tubes, and catheters is both ineffective and hazardous, as is an attempt to \u201cmaintain sterility of the wound\u201d [56, 72, 73].",

Postoperative meningitis and neutropenia require immediate and aggressive Gram-negative coverage, to include P. aeruginosa; cefepime or ceftazidime provides this and moderate additional Gram-positive coverage while achieving adequate central nervous system penetration. Aminoglycosides have broad activity against Gram-negative organisms but are now less frequently used because of concerns about toxicity and the need for monitoring drug levels. For these reasons, however, they have regained activity against some of the more resistant pathogens and provide a potent alternative under select circumstances. Conversely, the fluoroquinolones (e.g., ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin) provide broad Gram-negative activity and are easy to use, but their popularity has resulted in rapidly declining levels of activity against many major pathogens, moderating their utility.

Duration of therapy will often depend on these measures, as controlled studies of optimal courses of therapy are often lacking. Therapy should be continued just long enough to maximize response while minimizing subsequent development of resistance or toxicity. The Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines [8] suggest 7\u201310 days of antibiotic therapy is usually appropriate, guided by clinical response. Guidelines for treatment of complicated intra-abdominal infections suggest limiting therapy to 4\u20137 days, unless source control is inadequate [17].",

For bacteremia due to S. aureus treatment should be extended to 4 or more weeks when there is evidence of deep infection, such as endocarditis.

A longer course of therapy is also often warranted in patients with neutropenia, diabetes mellitus, severe malnutrition, or cirrhosis. Correcting these underlying conditions contributes significantly to improved recovery.",

The authors found that most patients responded as well to 8 days of therapy as to 15, yet were exposed to fewer antibiotics and were thus less likely to develop subsequent resistance. This seminal study changed a long-standing practice of treating pneumonia for 2\u20133 weeks, confirmed by subsequent meta-analysis of 4 randomized controlled trials comparing 7\u20138 days to 10\u201315 days of therapy [82]. Duration may be shorter still in those who respond rapidly but may require more extended courses in the patient who is slow to respond [83]. The use of inhaled, aerosolized antibiotics delivers high concentrations of antibiotic directly to the lung, potentially reducing adverse systemic effects. Early studies, whether of treatment or as an effort to reduce multidrug-resistant organism colonization of the lung, hold promise and warrant further investigation [84].",

Tempering this optimism is the observation that subsequent overuse has stimulated a modern crisis of resistance, exacerbated by a dearth of newly developed antibiotics.

The solution to this \u201cperfect storm\u201d is careful diagnosis, thoughtful treatment, and judicious restraint, allied with systematic preventive measures to optimize safe care and remove the hazards that promote infection.",
