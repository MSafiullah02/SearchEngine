From the first trials for herbicide resistance until now, transformation protocols have been developed for almost all important vegetable crops.

Among the other vegetable crops, tomato fulfils the basic requirements for gene transfer, which includes its character as a model object for in vitro culture techniques (Bhatia et al. 2004), its moderately sized genome with 950 Mb (Shibata 2005) applicable to recent sequencing technology and its importance as vegetable crop for the fresh market and for processing. Hence, it is not surprising that the first commercialized transgenic food crop ever brought to market was Calgene's \u2018Flavr Savr\u2019 tomato in 1994. It was followed in 1995 by DNA Plant Technology's \u2018Endless Summer\u2019. \u2018Flavr Savr\u2019 was a success with consumers but failed economically for a variety of reasons (Martineau 2001). In 1996 Zeneca launched a transgenic processing tomato product that was the best selling tomato paste in the United Kingdom during 1999\u2013\u20132000. The paste reduced processing costs and resulted in a 20% lower price (Redenbaugh and McHughen 2004).",

Insect resistance (see also Chap. 10.1007/978-3-642-02391-0_10) has been engineered by using bacterial genes derived from Bacillus thuringiensis ssp. kurstaki (Bt genes; Fischhoff et al. 1987; Delannay et al. 1989) or a proteinase inhibitor from potato (Abdeen et al. 2005) which is a part of the plant natural defence mechanism against herbivores.

Although technically more difficult and therefore not ideal for the grower, there are many potential opportunities for enhancing nutritional value (Bird et al. 1991; R\u00f6mer et al. 2000; Muir et al. 2001; Le Gall et al. 2003; Giorio et al. 2007) and organoleptic qualities such as taste (Penarrubia et al. 1992; Bartoszewski et al. 2003) and aroma in the tomato fruits. Important quality parameters of fresh fruits are volatile compounds, which often do not meet the high standards of flavour required by the consumer. For instance the \u0394-9 desaturase gene from Saccharomyces cerevisiae expressed in tomato showed changes in certain flavour compounds (Wang et al. 1996). The overexpression of a non-specific alcohol dehydrogenase gene in tomato fruits (Speirs et al. 1998) altered the levels of aroma determining aldehydes and alcohols. In a preliminary taste trial, the authors identified fruits with elevated alcohol dehydrogenase activity and higher level of alcohols as having a more intense \u2018ripe fruit\u2019 flavour.",

Today pepper is cultivated also in the subtropics and in temperate climates as a staple vegetable crop. Belonging to the family Solanaceae well known for plants with an excellent tissue culture and transformation capability, pepper is a recalcitrant exception. First, Liu et al. (1990) reported about Agrobacterium-mediated transformation of bell pepper. They showed the principal possibility of pepper transformation with foreign genes like nptII and gus. In 1993, US patent 5262316 (Engler et al. 1993) described the co-cultivation of explant material from the pepper plant with A. tumefaciens or A. rhizogenes carrying an exogenous DNA sequence. Therefore the invention related to a method for genetically transforming and regenerating pepper plants. Despite a detailed description of the transformation procedure, the patent gives no clearness about the regeneration efficiency. Over the past 15 years a few other groups (e.g. Zhu et al. 1996; Manoharan et al. 1998; Pozueta-Romero et al. 2001; Li et al. 2003; Lee et al. 2004) have been working on the improvement of the transformation system for pepper. In summary it should be stated that the pepper transformation is not a routine method and is highly dependent on genotype and explant source.",

Liu et al. (2008) reported the acquired insect resistance of cabbage after chloroplast genetic engineering with a Bt gene, demonstrating the efficiency of the genetic modification of plastids. They cited Bock (2007) that the plastid transformation is a prerequisite method to produce vaccines or therapeutic proteins in plants. So far, this general statement has not been realized for Brassica vegetables. Although the Brassica vegetable crops are important, to date only Pogrebnyak et al. (2006) has reported the Agrobacterium-mediated transformation of collard and cauliflower with, respectively, a smallpox vaccine candidate gene and a gene coding for SARS coronavirus spike protein.",

Lettuce belongs to the family Asteraceae, with approximately 100 species of Lactuca. Only the four species L. sativa L., L. serriola L., L. saligna L. and L. virosa represent the important breeding pool. They are self-fertilized diploids and can be crossed with each other.

A thaumatin-like protein from rice was expressed in carrot and showed enhanced tolerance to six fungal pathogens (Chen and Punja 2002; Punja 2005). Transgenic carrots with the tobacco osmotin (AP24) in combination with a chitinase and a glucanase gene also expressed broad-spectrum tolerance (Tigelaar et al. 1996; Melchers and Stuiver 2000). Carrot lines which constitutively expressed a human lysozyme showed enhanced resistance to E. heraclei and A. dauci (Takaichi and Oeda 2000).

Enhancing the concentration of bioavailable calcium in vegetables could prevent calcium malnutrition and reduce the incidence of osteoporosis (Park et al. 2004b). Furthermore, carrots have been engineered into the ketocarotenoid biosynthetic pathway by introducing a \u03b2-carotene ketolase gene from the alga Haematococcus pluvialis. Transgenic carrots converted up to 70% of total carotenoids to novel ketocarotenoids, showing that carrots are suitable for applications to the functional food, nutraceutical and aquaculture industries (Jayaraj et al. 2008; Jayaraj and Punja 2008).",

Although the number of trials is indicative of who is working on what vegetable, it does not accurately reflect the absolute activity. On the trial number basis, tomato accounts for over half. Transformation technology is potentially an effective tool for vegetable breeding in fields that are not easily accessible by conventional breeding techniques. Nevertheless no more commercial utilization is expected in the near future in Europe or the United States. Only a few GM cultivars are licensed for different countries, such as tomato, zucchini, chicory and eggplant. Despite the transgenic zucchini cultivation in the United States on probably 10 000 ha, no market launch is expected in the EU. In China, GM peppers are supposed to be cultivated. However, reliable information is not yet available, because a lot of the research is being done in the private sector. Commercial utilization of Bt-eggplants in India and the Philippines will start in 2009; and the use of GM garden peas is expected in the medium term.\n",

Vegetables with clear benefits for the consumers are needed to develop demand. Although technically more difficult, there are many potential opportunities for enhancing the nutritional value or consumer appeal of vegetables through genetic engineering. In addition to modification of flavour, research projects to increase the content of vitamins, minerals or nutraceuticals in vegetables are in progress. Despite the fact that transformation is a powerful approach to plant improvement, the major impediment to genetically engineered vegetables is the reluctance of the consumer and subsequently the market.",
