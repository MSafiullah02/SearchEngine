Hence, reasoning mechanisms are used for carrying two tasks, ontology validation and ontology analysis. The validation of an ontology consists in checking if the ontology is correctly modelling the domain in focus, whereas the analysis of an ontology focuses on deducing facts about the modelled domain, processing and extracting new information from the original information.

To that effect we collected the DMP template for both the EC Horizon 2020 programme, and the FCT project funding. We then proceeded to attempt to validate that DCSO would cover the entirety of both the DMP templates, and establish the necessary mappings. However we came to the conclusion that we would have to extend the DCSO, in order to better address the mapping of the DMP templates to the DCSO. The extension was limited to the addition of three object properties that were added to the Project class, they can be identified in Fig. 2 ",

Our decision was to create a single DMP that would cover both projects. By using the instantiated ontology and the DL queries we were able to assert if the DMP complied with funder's requirements and compiled the analysis results in a document. Figure 3 shows the verification of one of the FCT requirements, which state that every project must cover the cost to provide open access to their outputs. Some journals charge an additional fee in order to provide open access to a published paper, as a result researchers must include the costs of these fees in the DMP to be submitted in the project proposal, as well as, in the periodic reviews. As can be seen in Fig. 3 the costs for open access are detailed for the GenomePT project bot not for the Oneida project. Additionally, we can use these queries to get the list of costs covered by a project or the whole DMP. Another example is the researchers effort per project. Figure 4 shown the staff assigned to each project. The researcher \"susana.ladeiro\" is assigned to both projects which means that this researcher does not work in just one project. This means that the costs associated with this researcher must be covered in both projects. Another functionality provided by the use of ontologies is the provision of explanations for each of the results of a query. In this example, Fig. 5 depicts the explanation for assigning the researcher \"susana.ladeiro\" to the GenomePT project. This is a very simple example to show the potential of this feature, it can provide researchers an explanation on which funder's requirements are not compliant and the reasons for being non-compliant.",

Another possible action point is use one of the many existing DMP creation frameworks (e.g. DMP Online 5 , DMP Tool 6 , Data Stewardship Wizzard 7 etc.) to automate the creation a instantiated DCSO. This would minimize the necessity for an ontology expert in the process.",
