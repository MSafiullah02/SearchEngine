Bocaviruses are members of the family Parvoviridae, subfamily Parvovirinae; previously identified members of this genus are pathogens of bovines and canines.

            "text": "The family Parvoviridae comprises 2 subfamilies; these are the Densovirinae, which consist of arthropod pathogens, and Parvovirinae, made up of 5 genera (parvovirus, erythrovirus, dependovirus, amdovirus, and bocavirus). The type species of the Dependovirus subfamily are the adeno-associated viruses, which require helper viruses for replication and which are commonly utilized as vectors in gene therapy. Erythrovirus (parvovirus B19) is, of course, a well-known human pathogen. HBoV appears to be the second member of this family of DNA viruses that causes disease in humans. It should also be noted that an apparently novel parvovirus, PARV4, has recently been identified in the blood of 2 patients with febrile illnesses [2]. Plasma samples from 25 subjects (23 of whom were male) with acute viral syndrome who underwent screening for acute HIV infection (with negative results) were examined for the presence of viral nucleic acids using a sequence-independent PCR amplification method. This led to the identification of 3 DNA viruses that had not previously been identified. Two, SAV-1 and SAV-2, were viruses with circular DNA with regions of homology to the anelloviruses, TorqueTenoVirus (TTV) and TorqueTenoMiniVirus (TMV), which are present in high frequency in healthy blood donors. Examination of a plasma specimen from a third patient yielded a parvovirus, PARV4, that represented a distinct lineage between the adeno-associated viruses and BPV-3, which infects primates and chipmunks. The genetic distance of this virus from human parvovirus B19 indicates that the primers currently in use to detect the latter would not be capable of amplifying PARV4 DNA, an important issue both in clinical diagnostics and in blood-banking. However, the pathogenicity, if any, of PARV4, as well as of SAV-1 and SAV-2, remains to be determined. Another novel parvovirus, HBoV, has recently been identified in nasopharyngeal secretions from patients with acute respiratory tract infection [1] .",

Although culture attempts were unsuccessful, a coronavirus was detected, in the absence of any other identified pathogen, in a specimen obtained from a 71year-old man with chronic obstructive lung disease who had been hospitalized because of pneumonia in 2004. Phylogenetic analysis found that the virus, CoV-HKU1, is a new member of group 2 of the coronaviruses. CoV-HKU1 was present in concentrations of 8.5-9.6 \u03eb 10 6 copies/mL of nasopharyngeal secretions in the first week of illness, decreasing to 1.5 \u03eb 10 5 copies/mL in the second week and becoming undetectable thereafter. The illness was associated with increasing IgM and IgG antibody titers to recombinant nucleocapsid protein of CoV-HKU1.",

The latter, of course, causes severe respiratory infections, whereas the HCoV-229E and HCoV-Oc43 are frequent causes of winter colds. Although it also causes a mild respiratory illness, HCoV-NL63 has been linked to bronchiolitis and croup in children, and it has also been isolated from children with Kawasaki disease. Although CoV-HKU1 has only been identified in 2 patients, both were adults with pneumonia, suggesting the possibility that it may cause significant lower respiratory tract infection. Consistent with the hypothesis that the 1918 human influenza A virus emerged directly from an avian source, examination of the amino acid sequence of the polymerase protein sequences of the 1918 virus found variation from the avian consensus sequence at just 10 amino acids. Examination of synonymous differences, however, suggested some degree of evolutionary distance between the human and avian viruses. Examination of its complete genomic sequence by Taubenberger and colleagues, together with phylogenetic analysis, found that the 1918 human virus was \"an entirely avian-like virus that adapted to humans.\"",

Using plasmid-based reverse genetic techniques, investigators have now generated complete infectious virus containing these 8 coding sequences. This virus demonstrated characteristics associated with high infectivity and virulence, including the ability to replicate in the absence of trypsin (indicating an ability to cleave and thus activate its hemagglutinin). Intranasal inoculation was lethal to mice, with virus having multiplied to very high titers in their lungs and causing severe histological changes consistent with those seen in human victims of the virus in 1918. The mouse virulence of the reconstructed 1918 virus was significantly greater than that observed with any other human influenza virus studied. Consistent with its originsand unlike most human influenza viruses-the reconstructed virus was lethal to chicken embryos.",

They also provide evidence that the virus arose directly from an avian influenza strain with limited evolution before initiation of the pandemic. The concern commonly expressed with regard to the potential of the current avian influenza epidemic to cause a human pandemic has been the potential occurrence of a reassortment event in a dually infected (with virulent avian and human influenza viruses) human or pig. The evidence discussed here with regard to the 1918 human influenza virus, however, demonstrates that virulence for humans, together with the capability of facile human-to-human transmission, may occur as the result of mutational events in the absence of reassortment.",
