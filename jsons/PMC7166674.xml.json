Of these individuals, approximately 25% develop HBV\u2010associated diseases, including liver failure, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Nowadays, HCC is the second leading cause of cancer related death in China 4. Based on comparison of the HBV genome sequence, eight genotypes of HBV (A to H) have been classified 5, 6, 7, 8. These genotypes have distinct geographical distributions 9, 10, 11. Genotypes A and D have a higher prevalence in Europe and North America whereas genotypes B and C are prevalent in East Asia, including China, Japan, and other countries in South Asia. In China, genotypes C and B account for approximately 60% and 40% of infected individuals, respectively, whereas the other genotypes are very rare. Patients with genotype C HBV are at greater risk of advanced HCC than those with other genotypes.",

Depending on their cellular origin, stimulus nature and antigenic specificity, two major classes of IFN in humans have been designated as type I IFNs (\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b5, \u03ba, \u03c9 and \u03c4) and as type II IFNs (\u03b3), each of which contains multiple subtypes 12. Under normal/healthy conditions, only a low level of IFNs are expressed, yet they increase when the body is attacked by viral infections, or exposed to double\u2010stranded RNA 12. Therefore, IFNs have been considered as a natural medical resource for antiviral agents since the 1960s. However, due to the high cost of development, only IFN\u03b12 is approved by the Food and Drug Administration and is widely applied in therapeutic use against specific types of leukemia 13, 14, 15, multiple sclerosis 16, 17, hepatitis B 18, 19, 20 and C 21, 22, 23, genital warts 24, 25, 26 and cancers 27, 28, 29, 30.",

IFN\u03b12 has been routinely used as an antiviral agent to treat chronic HBV (CHB) infection in the last two decades. Unfortunately, the therapeutic outcomes for many Asian patients, who account for 75% of CHB carriers and are infected by genotype B or C virus, are far from satisfactory 32, 33. It has been found that genotype B and C HBV predisposed the patients to a higher risk of complications, including liver cirrhosis and HCC 34, 35, 36. Several factors, including short half\u2010life, limited possible dosage and a low local hepatic concentration of IFN, may cause the therapeutic inefficiency. On the other hand, IFN has many subtypes, and each of them bears different specificities and efficacies against viruses 12. It has been shown that CHB patients with genotype A respond to IFN\u03b12 treatment markedly better than those with genotype C 37, 38, 39. The antiviral effects of other IFN\u03b1 subtypes for genotype C HBV are yet to be tested. Our previous studies demonstrated that the anti\u2010SARS coronavirus activities of IFN\u03b11 were over 20\u2010fold stronger than those of IFN\u03b12 (He et al., unpublished data). Therefore, it is worthwhile to investigate the anti\u2010HBV activities of IFN\u03b11, particularly against the genotype C virus.",

The EGFP expression level and the transduction efficiency were increased with an elevation of the multiplicity of infection, whereas strong fluorescent signals lasted for several passages (data not shown). Prolonged IFN\u03b11 gene expression mediated by rAAV in hepatocytes was observed (Figure 1). Furthermore, we performed pre\u2010administration of rAAV before hydrodynamic transfection of pHBV plasmid to resolve the difficulty of importing HBV\u2010carrier animals (i.e. HBV transgenic mice), and also the problems of short\u2010term gene expression and replication of HBV in the hydrodynamic transfection mouse model. In the present study, strong EGFP and IFN\u03b11 signals were demonstrated in the liver cells (Figure 4). High levels of IFN\u03b11 were observed in the liver for at least 4 weeks (data not shown). The concentration of IFN\u03b11 in the liver was approximately eight\u2010fold higher than that in the plasma. Since the half\u2010life of IFN is short (i.e. approximately 2 h) in a healthy circulation system and the repeated injection of IFN was one of the major concerns, a sustained level of IFN in the liver is certainly an advantage. A constant and prolonged local expression of IFN would surely benefit the anti\u2010HBV treatment by reducing side\u2010effects or by enhancing efficacy. As no obvious IFN induction or toxicity was observed in both in vitro and in vivo, rAAV appears to be a suitable vector in gene transfer or delivery of IFN\u03b11.",

This finding is of prime significance because a minimal dosage has already achieved a similar antiviral effect as a high\u2010dosage (1000 units/ml) of recombinant IFN\u03b3 in Huh6 and HB611 cells 61. Moreover, such an antiviral effect was equivalent to commercially available IFN\u03b1 (50 000 units/ml), which is isolated from leukocytes and composed of multiple interferon isoforms (see Supplementary Figure S1). The drastic decrease (i.e. over ten\u2010fold) of HBsAg, HBeAg, and viral load (i.e. by over 30\u2010fold) in the plasma was another achievement with the use of AAV\u2010IFN\u03b11. Since little effect could be contributed by the animal immune system, IFN\u03b11 might somewhat stimulate other biological mechanisms in vivo that further synergize its antiviral activity. This is because IFNs are capable of acting directly (i.e. against infected cells), and indirectly (i.e. against viral infections by extending the innate and adaptive immune responses), thus boosting the overall antiviral ability 62.",

The major advantage of shRNA is that it displays sequence\u2010specific targeting where one can design multiple effective shRNAs to target various transcripts. Previously, our team showed that shRNA displayed synergistic antiviral effects with lamuvidine 54. However, when rAAV\u2010shRNA was compared with rAAV\u2010IFN\u03b11, the latter offers more advantages. First, IFN\u03b1 is a secreted protein, which could spread from one cell to the other via circulation. Effective antiviral effects could be easily achieved by transducing a portion of liver cells using rAAV\u2010IFN\u03b1 vectors. For shRNAs, they expressed in an intracellular manner, which could not be transferred from one cell to another. This limits its antiviral efficacy and increases the difficulty for gene delivery. The effectiveness of shRNA delivery is one of the major concerns in anti\u2010HBV gene therapy. Second, the efficacy and safety of IFN\u03b1 have been proven clinically for decades, yet these issues remain to be elucidated for microRNA/shRNA. In an animal study, oversaturation of cellular microRNA/shRNA has been shown to lead to fatality in mice. Therefore, safety issues of using microRNA/shRNA based gene therapy are still a concern 50. Our team has investigated the feasibility of AAV2\u2010shRNA vector for the treatment of HBV. In that study, no obvious liver damage or mortality was observed in nude mice (He et al., unpublished data). However, off\u2010target shRNAs and the rapid generation of shRNA\u2010resistant mutants 64 raise other concerns with respect to shRNA based gene therapy. Taken together, the advantage of IFN\u03b1 lacking resistance selection gives confidence to the proposed application of rAAV\u2010IFN\u03b11 vector for anti\u2010HBV therapy.",

These findings provide a foundation for the feasibility of using AAV\u2010IFN\u03b11 vector in anti\u2010HBV gene therapy.
