Pregnancy-related increases in disease severity have been reported for CMV [1], SARS [2], Varicella Zoster [3], Listeria monocytogenes [4], malaria [5], as well as influenza virus. Numerous reports suggest that influenza infection results in increased morbidity and mortality during pregnancy with the greatest risk in the second and third trimesters [6\u201311]. In all recorded influenza pandemics including 1918, 1957, and 2009, pregnant women exposed to the pandemic strain experienced significantly increased death rates [6, 7, 10]. Moreover, women that survive influenza infection faced increased risks of adverse pregnancy outcomes, including preterm birth and fetal death [10\u201315].",

            "text": "Many hypotheses have been advanced to explain these epidemiological data using Sir Peter Medawar's posit as a springboard [16]. Medawar hypothesized that some type of immune suppression must occur to allow a semi-allogeneic fetus to escape attack. Subsequent research at the maternal\u2013fetal interface and maternal peripheral circulation resulted in sometimes conflicting hypotheses, including that pregnancy involves a shift toward Th2 immunity [17] or variants thereof [18], a controlled state of inflammation [19], or a combination of both depending on the stage of pregnancy [20]. Evidence for and against each of these hypotheses can be found in the literature. In no small measure, the lack of consensus on the exact nature of phenotypic changes to immunity during pregnancy can be explained by limitations in previous investigations, including differences in study design, the use of animal models, or a focus on one narrow aspect of immunity. Additionally, the anatomical site of analysis (peripheral blood/spleen versus uterine environment) may have a profound impact on the conclusions drawn. Study design is critical. Most published studies have been cross-sectional, but substantial interpersonal variability in immunologic parameters poses a significant challenge to data interpretation.",

            "text": "The present study enrolled pregnant women early in pregnancy and followed them to at least 6 months postpartum in order to evaluate selective components of the maternal systemic immune response that might explain the increased severity and complications of influenza infection during the latter stages of pregnancy. This approach differed from other investigations which focused primarily on the maternal\u2013fetal interface, an approach that was used as the basis for the Th2 hypothesis [17]. That report found no bias toward Th2 cytokine production from unstimulated or ConA stimulated splenocytes during pregnancy [21]. Other groups that suggested an inflammatory view of pregnancy either focused on the maternal\u2013fetal interface or on particular cell types, such as monocytes, that they reported to have increased activity [22]. In our longitudinal study, blood was collected from women three times during pregnancy and twice in the post partum period in an effort to monitor some elements of the immune system known to be important for influenza virus control. Cellular and soluble components of blood representing innate and adaptive immune elements were analyzed. In order to remove the influence of interpersonal variability in immune response, each woman's pregnant immune profile was compared to her own 6-month measurements. In this paper, we present the alterations and compensatory changes we observed in maternal blood cell counts, NK, and T cell function and serum defensins as pregnancy progressed.",

Additionally, many studies of the immunology of the human maternal\u2013fetal interface compare unremarkable pregnancies to those complicated by adverse pregnancy outcomes. In these cases, it is impossible to disentangle the consequences of the disease from those inherent to immunological adaptations of pregnancy. Our longitudinal study reduces interpersonal variability by comparing each woman's immune function during pregnancy to her own response 6 months post-partum, thus eliminating the negative influence of interpersonal variability in immune profile. We also took a comprehensive approach to evaluating immunological adaptations in pregnancy, examining activity of cells in both innate and adaptive immunity, along with serum hormone levels, \u03b1-defensins 1\u20133, and peripheral blood cytokines. A complementary vaccine study during gestation was performed with a second cohort to analyze B cell responses.

We had previously reported an increase in serum G-CSF expression during pregnancy that could in part explain the increase in granulocytes [23]. In turn, this increase in phagocytes, or their increased activation state [22, 25, 35], could explain the rise in \u03b1-defensins 1\u20133, as neutrophils and other phagocytes are major producers of these peptides. These cascading events could be crucial to the success of a woman's defense against microbial infection in the pregnant state. Subsequent studies will evaluate phagocyte functional activation more comprehensively.",

By week 35, the absolute number of CD56dim cells declined by over 60%. The cells that remained had reduced spontaneous cytokine secretion as well as reduced secretion of cytokines when stimulated with either IL-12/IL-15 or with IL-2 (data not shown). NK cells play an important role in pregnancy. Uterine NK cells serve critical functions in trophoblast invasion as well as spiral artery remodeling [36, 37]. Loss of NK cells early in gestation may therefore be deleterious to the pregnancy, possibly resulting in poor placental invasion and perfusion. Placentation is completed by 20 weeks' gestation; thus, the declines in NK cell count and activity that we observed in late pregnancy may be consistent with their physiological functions. [38].",

Populations of B cell precursors are reduced in the bone marrow. However, estrogen appears to increase survival and expansion of B cell subsets. Estrogen administration in vitro increases IgM and IgG production from PBMCs [39], and estrogen administration in vivo can lead to the increase of autoantibody production in SLE mouse models [40]. Together, these data suggest that pregnancy or associated hormones might negatively regulate new B cell development while enhancing antibody production in mature B cells. In our cohort, B cells were reduced in the periphery during the third trimester relative to the postpartum measures. However, from our influenza vaccine cohort (Sperling et al., manuscript in press), we found no loss of antibody response to the inactive flu vaccine during pregnancy. It can be argued that due to past exposure of antigenically similar virus strains, the influenza vaccine response is mostly reliant on a memory response [41], while estrogen reportedly affects na\u00efve precursor B cells.",

Proinflammatory cytokines IFN\u03b3 and TNF\u03b1 have divergent regulation, with IFN\u03b3 decreasing during pregnancy while the expression of TNF\u03b1 increases. Although it is unclear what the overall consequence of this regulation is in vivo, we showed that circulating NK cells secrete more IFN\u03b3 in patients with high serum concentrations of IL-12, suggesting that these serum cytokines are functionally active in vivo. We further showed that peripheral blood mononuclear cells that were treated with mid-pregnancy serum were less able to inhibit viral replication than cells treated with post-pregnancy serum, suggesting that other cytokines, i.e., type I and II IFN, are active against virus infection in concentrations found in serum.",

We report an increase of phagocytic cells and serum \u03b1-defensins 1\u20133 that appears to persist throughout pregnancy. The abundance of pDCs may enhance the levels of type I IFN during a viral infection. As these are known to be vital and effective barriers to infection, their elevation might suggest no increase, and possibly even a decrease, in susceptibility during pregnancy. However, once an infection is established, the decreased efficacy of the important anti-viral effector cell populations (NK and T cells) during the late second and third trimesters, may compromise viral clearance, and these changes may underlie the reported increase in disease severity that have been reported in other studies [10\u201312].

Is there a need to protect the fetus because of its antigenic content, or are strong pro-inflammatory systemic responses harmful to the developing fetus? In the first scenario, the local immune regulation critical for blocking rejection of the fetus affects systemic responses non-specifically. For example, Tregs that might be generated against paternal or male antigens can produce cytokines that will act to suppress responses to other stimuli. If this is the case, then the altered immune response to influenza and other pathogens is merely a side effect of suppression of the alloresponse and any therapeutic efforts to bolster antiviral immunity might not be detrimental to mother or fetus. However, it is also possible that strong pro-inflammatory systemic immune responses to any target might be detrimental to the developing fetus and must be regulated. In this scenario, efforts aimed at increasing the immune response to an acute infection acquired in the perinatal period may have adverse effects on fetal survival. Studies are currently underway to address this question.",

Among subjects in our study, a substantial increase occurred in the level of phagocytes, serum cytokine levels change drastically, and serum defensins are elevated. Moreover, there was a striking rise in the type 1 IFN producing plasmacytoid DC population. However, in concert with these alterations, NK and T cell number and function decreased markedly, especially during the late second and third trimesters, indicating a shift away from inflammatory Th1 responses and the production of IFN\u03b3. Moreover, both NK and na\u00efve T cells showed constitutive changes in a number of gene products in the steady state. In contrast to the prevailing hypothesis, we found no indication of a rise of Th2 cytokines. While peripheral B cell numbers were observed to decrease in the third trimester, no loss of B cell response to the influenza trivalent vaccine was found in our other cohort (Sperling et al., manuscript in press). Overall, these changes can be characterized as a shift in the priorities of the systemic immune system with a selective repression of maternal immune responses and a shift to defensive immunity.",
