Severe Acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) originated from southern China and rapidly spread to many countries in early 2003 with over 8000 cases worldwide.1 Human infection due to a highly pathogenic avian influenza A (H5N1) virus was first described in a mini-outbreak from Hong Kong in 1997. Since 2003, there were many reports of the infection in wide birds and domestic poultry in many countries. Since then, more than 150 human cases and 80 deaths have been reported.2 Both infections are of animal origins and the viruses have jumped the species barrier. Children infected with SARS usually developed mild disease,3 but the reported mortality for children infected with avian flu was more than 50%.4 Early and proper isolation of infected individuals along with strict public health measures are important in controlling these infections.5\n",

The incubation period is between 5\u201310 days. Children usually presented with fever and symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection. The initial radiograph is usually normal while early thoracic computer tomography may show poorly defined, ground glass opacifications of the lung in the subpleural areas.6 The typical laboratory findings are lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia and elevation of liver enzymes. The non-specific clinical and laboratory findings are no different from children with pneumonia due to other rival etiologies.3 SARS is caused by a newly identified coronavirus which is genetically very similar to strains of coronavirus isolated in wild animals sold in the markets in the Guangdong province of China.7 The most reliable rapid early diagnosis is by reverse-transcription-polymerase chain reaction to detect the virus in respiratory secretions.",

A national band in slaughtering and human consumption of these animals was highly successful in preventing re-emergence of SARS. The control of avian flu will be a lot more difficult, if not impossible, as the natural reservoirs are many species of birds and domestic poultry. To complicate the issue, many species of birds can carry the virus without any apparent signs of illness. If mutation of the virus occurs resulting in efficient human to human transmission, a pandemic resulting in significant global mortality is highly likely. There is an urgent need for effective monitoring of outbreak and carriage of avian flu in wild birds and domestic poultry. Development of effective immunization and anti-virals are necessary to control outbreak at the source. Proper isolation of infected cases and border control will be necessary to minimize the impact when large outbreaks of human cases do occur.",
