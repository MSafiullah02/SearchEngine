The thick secretions of anionic mucus and glycosaminoglycan are likely to prevent access of carrier/DNA complexes to the epithelial cell surface, and may dilute or alter the composition of the complexes. There are other barriers including mechanical hindrance by cilia and the glycocalyx. In the presence of many mucosal barriers, liposome/DNA complexes can lose their physical integrity and can be destabilized by negatively charged materials or lung surfactants 15, 19. The latter causes DNA to dissociate from the complex. DNA released from the complex is vulnerable to nuclease attack.

This cationic emulsion successfully delivered a reporter gene into cells in vitro in the presence of up to 90% serum.

Unlike liposomal carriers, the cationic emulsion that we developed retained its physical integrity at high concentrations of serum (up to 90%) when complexed with DNA.

The emulsifier/water dispersion was sonicated until clear in an ice/water bath by using a probe type sonicator (High intensity ultrasonic processor, 600W model; Sonics and Materials, Danbury, CT, USA). The lipid solution was added to the oil and in turn sonicated in an ice/water bath for ca. 4 min to form emulsions. To prepare liposome carriers, the lipid solutions were further sonicated for ca. 4 min after the solution became clear. The prepared lipid carriers were kept at 4 \u00b0C for further experiments. The lipid compositions of prepared lipid carriers, which have been optimized for transfection in our previous study 21, 23, are summarized in Table 1. Throughout this paper, we will compare the transfection activity of emulsions with liposomes made with an identical lipid composition. We will refer to this liposome as \u2018counterpart liposome\u2019 in this paper. The counterpart liposome is defined as the liposome that has identical lipid compositions to the emulsion, but only lacking the oil component. The following terms will be used in the paper. C/D: the weight ratio between the cationic lipid in the lipid formulation and DNA in the complex. C/Dmin: the minimum C/D ratio to form a carrier/DNA complex without free DNA on agarose gel retardation assay. C/Dopt: the C/D ratio that shows the highest in vitro transfection activity.",

Therefore, the transfection activity of the emulsion/DNA complex against DNase I digestion was evaluated with or without destabilizers using a human nasal squamous cell carcinoma (RPMI 2650) and a human large cell lung carcinoma (H1299) to mimic the in vivo airway situations. Heparin sulfate and Newfectan were added as destabilizers to the RPMI 2650 and H1299, respectively. Before this experiment, the transfection efficiency was evaluated at various C/D ratios to find C/Dopt. C/Dopt values of LE1, LE3, LP1, and LP3 were 4. The C/Dopt values, however, increased by adding Tween 80 into the lipid formulations to 8 for DOTAP/Tween 80 emulsion (LE2) and DOTAP/DOPE/Tween 80 emulsion (LE4) and 6 for DOTAP/Tween 80 liposome (LP2) and DOTAP/DOPE/Tween 80 liposome (LP4), respectively 21, 23. The transfection activities of different formulations at C/Dopt are shown in Figure 2. Naked DNA was also used as a control. As shown in Figures 2A and 2B, although the expression level of luciferase between the cell types varied, the transfection efficiency of liposomes and emulsions increased by adding the other lipid components referred to as the helper lipids such as DOPE and Tween 80 23. Although DNase I alone could not significantly affect the transfection activity of the liposome/DNA complexes in both cell lines, the addition of heparin sulfate and a lung surfactant dramatically inhibited the transfection activity of the liposome/DNA complexes. This decrease was accelerated to an undetectable level by adding DNase I. The inhibition might be not due to the toxic effect of destabilizers, as judged by the number and morphology of living cells (data not shown). In the emulsion system, however, these destabilizers attenuated only slightly the transfection efficiency of the complexes. Over 40% of the original efficiency was maintained even in the mixed media containing heparin or a lung surfactant in the presence of DNase I in both cell systems.",

Therefore, in this study, we further investigated whether the particle size of the emulsion/DNA complex affects the differential expression of transgene in the nasal cavity and lung. To this end, LE3 was complexed at C/D = 4. The volume and DNA dose were changed for intranasal administration. By fixing the C/D value, the surface charge effect was excluded under this experimental condition. The average particle size of LE3/DNA complexes was measured by using photon correlation spectroscopy. The mean particle size of the complex was dependent on the volume of the complex solution (Figure 4A). As the volume of complex solution increased, the mean particle size decreased gradually; the expression of transgene increased in the lung, but decreased in the nasal cavity. In 25 \u00b5l, the expression level dramatically decreased in both of the tissues due to inactive large aggregates (>450 nm) between DNA and the emulsion during complexation.",

One day after the re\u2010administration, a similar gene expression level to the level obtained after initial administration that was obtained at day 1 was observed in both tissues and the expression was maintained for 14 days.

            "text": "The enhanced in vivo transfection activity with the emulsion in the nasal cavity and lung could be explained by a number of possibilities. One of these may be the difference of DNA degradation in lipid carrier/DNA complexes by mucosal secretions. The DNA in the complex must survive and deliver intact DNA to the target cells in the nasal mucosa. In mucosal secretions, there are many anionic materials that can compete with and substitute DNA in the complex. The released DNA is vulnerable to nuclease attack 15. Such a substitution has been assumed to be a major destabilization mechanism for the lipid/DNA complex 12, 15, 16. In addition to mucosal secretions, a recent report revealed that lung surfactants markedly inhibited cationic liposome\u2010mediated gene transfer 17, 18. The stability of the DNA/emulsion complexes was investigated by observing the competitive exchange between heparin or Newfectan and DNA in the complexes in the presence of DNase. For the counterpart liposome/DNA complex, the plasmid began to dissociate as the equivalency of heparin increased above unity. A similar pattern was observed with the commercialized liposome, Lipofectamine (data not shown). In distinct contrast, the emulsion did not release its plasmid in the presence of destabilizers. Thus, the complex between DNA and the emulsion is extremely stable and is resistant to the competitive exchange by an anionic proteoglycan. As a consequence, DNA complexed with emulsion could be protected from a DNase attack. From these observations, we conclude that the stable emulsion/DNA complex provided a necessary protection against inactivation by mucosal secretions and a higher accessibility of the active DNA to airway epithelia than the liposome/DNA complex.",

We also have investigated the relationship between structural stability and in vivo transfection activity of complexes with stability\u2010modulated emulsions by changing the oil component in the emulsion 24. In that study, the most stable emulsion with squalene as the oil phase gave the most potent transfection activity after intravenous administration. These observations demonstrated that in vivo transfection activity was primarily associated with the stability of the complexes 30.",

Trilaurin was selected as an oil phase for this particular experiment since it is solid during the sample preparation process due to its high melting temperature (ca. 46.5 \u00b0C). In this experiment, the emulsion and DNA appeared to be fully combined at C/D = 4 and formed a chromatin\u2010like structure. It has been reported that a liposome loses its structural integrity during the formation of liposome/DNA complexes in which DNA is sandwiched between lamellar lipid sheets or forms a hexagonal phase 31, 32. Unlike liposomal carriers, however, the cationic emulsion even retains its structural integrity during the formation of emulsion/DNA complexes. Therefore, we believe that the difference in structure of emulsion/DNA complexes might be one of possible explanations as to why they are superior to liposome/DNA complexes in airway gene transfer.",

Interestingly, many transfected monocyte\u2010like cells were observed in NALT during immunohistochemical analysis. More importantly, in addition to NALT, a significant level of expression was observed in cervical lymph nodes from the mice administrated with the emulsion/DNA complexes (data not shown), indicating the cationic emulsion could be an in vivo delivery system for genetic vaccination against a pathogenic infection that may invade mucosal surfaces. It may be possible that the emulsion/DNA complexes can have inflammatory effects in vivo\n33, 34, 35. The observed inflammation may be related to the presence of unmethylated CpG dinucleotide sequences in bacterially derived DNA 36, 37. No signs of severe toxicity, however, were noticed, but flu\u2010like symptoms including fever and myalgia was observed over a period of 24 h when the dose was below 40 \u00b5g per mouse.",

The transfection efficiency of the emulsion carrier is ca. 200 times better than commonly used commercial liposome carriers. The increased transfection efficiency using the emulsion carrier may be ascribed to the increased probability of delivering intact DNA to the airway since the complex is strong and insensitive to mucosal destabilizers. Considering that there are numerous cationic lipids such as GL\u201067, which have been reported to be more efficient in mucosal gene delivery than DOTAP, it would be an interesting exploration to formulate and evaluate them as a cationic emulsion for mucosal gene delivery 38.",
