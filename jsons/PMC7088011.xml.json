Many forests are lost or fragmented due to plantations and farmland and traversed by road networks (Ellis et al. 2010; Ellis 2011). The loss of natural habitat directly results in loss of biodiversity and drives many specialist species to extinction. In contrast, some generalist species can persist and occasionally even profit from changes in the environment, with some showing inflated population densities in disturbed areas (Fahrig 2003; Suz\u00e1n et al. 2008). Fragmentation of habitats has been shown to decrease health and fitness of animals and to promote diseases, parasitism, and virus occurrence (Keesing et al. 2006; Acevedo-Whitehouse and Duffus 2009; Cottontail et al. 2009; Brearley et al. 2013).",

Bats are a good indicator group for habitat health as they are highly diverse and play major roles in pollination, pest control and seed dispersal (Jones et al. 2009; Cunto and Bernard 2012). In addition to their importance for ecosystem functioning, bats also are long-lived (Seim et al. 2013) and can have large group sizes and high mobility (Luis et al. 2013), all of which make them suitable model organisms for epidemiological studies (Drexler et al. 2012; Brook and Dobson 2015). Bats were identified as hosts to a great variety of viruses, some of them causing zoonotic diseases (e.g., Ebola, SARS, rabies), but research has focused mainly on RNA viruses, leaving DNA viruses largely unexplored (Calisher et al. 2006; Jones et al. 2008; Brook and Dobson 2015).",

Hepatitis B, a representative of these orthohepadnaviruses, is one of the most common and serious viral infectious diseases in humans, causing acute and chronic infections of the liver, resulting in an estimated 900,000 deaths each year (WHO Global Hepatitis Report 2017). Transmission occurs chiefly by direct contact with infected blood (WHO fact sheet #204, updated July 2016). In humans, the course of infection depends on the time of virus acquisition. Infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) during birth results in 90% of chronic courses, while infection during early childhood leads to chronicity in 30% of all cases. In contrast, over 95% of infections acquired by immune-competent adults result in acute and self-limiting course (Seeger and Mason 2000; Gish et al. 2015). Chronic courses of infection may be a common feature of orthohepadnaviruses. In woodchucks, an animal model of HBV, perinatal infection with the woodchuck hepatitis virus (WHV) results in 100% chronic courses infection (Seeger and Mason 2000).",

It commonly occurs in secondary forests and constructs its own roosts by modifying leaves of seven different plant families, often palms, into tent-like shelters (Baker and Clark 1987; Rodr\u00edguez-Herrera et al. 2007). It adapts well to anthropogenically modified habitats and readily roosts in the eaves of human houses, as well as in the leaves of non-native palms such as Cocos nucifera, Coccothrinax barbadensis, or Livistona chinensis (Timm and Lewis 1991; Rodr\u00edguez-Herrera et al. 2007) that are often planted as garden ornamentals (Sagot et al. 2013). Its potentially close contact with humans, the relatedness of TBHBV to primate HBV, and the ability of TBHBV to use the human NTCP are factors supporting the importance of virus ecology studies in U. bilobatum. We investigated environmental and host traits favoring TBHBV infection as well as patterns of transmission and distribution in U. bilobatum.",

We scaled the fixed variables and tested for multi colinearity using variance inflation factors (VIFs) implemented in the R library AED (Zuur 2010).

Both top models shared three variables, the extrinsic factor forest cover as well as the intrinsic variables sex and reproductive status, indicating a high importance of these variables. For decreasing forest cover the local TBHBV prevalence was increasing; additionally, females as well as reproductive active individuals tended to have a higher prevalence compared to males or non-reproductive active individuals, respectively (Table 4). The variable forest cover loss was slightly positively correlated with higher TBHBV prevalence, but it was weighted fairly low when averaged over all subset models (Table 4).

Since closely related TBHBV sequences are found in distant sample sites and the diversity at individual sample sites reflects the overall TBHBV diversity combined with the relatively slow evolution of hepadnaviruses, a long-term relationship between the bat host U. bilobatum and TBHBV in Panama can be assumed (Littlejohn et al. 2016). All samples cluster together with sequences previously published (Drexler et al. 2013), confirming the assignment as TBHBV. We did not find significant clustering of samples within years of collection, coinciding with the relatively slow virus evolution. However, samples collected in Veraguas as well as in Gamboa clustered more often together than expected by chance. These samples were frequently obtained from bats sharing the same roost or were roosting in close vicinity to each other, suggesting a largely unobstructed gene flow of virus strains within a given population. Clearly, we found no indication of genetic isolation by distance, suggesting a largely unobstructed gene flow of the virus strains within the country. This concurs with the wide distribution, high mobility, and abundance of this common bat species (Baker and Clark 1987; Meyer et al. 2009; Mantilla-Meluk 2014).",

Suitable roosting conditions are known to attract bats and favor the formation of larger groups (Campbell et al. 2006). A recent study has shown that resident bats are attracted to unknown, new individuals, possibly to obtain information about new food sources, which might lead to close contact between roost members and unfamiliar individuals (Ramakers et al. 2016).

            "text": "The prevalence of current TBHBV infections detected in the BCI Canal Zone area (0.8%, n = 262) was lower than the prevalence previously reported for the same study area (9.3%, n = 54; Drexler et al. 2013). The original description of TBHBV (Drexler et al. 2013) was based on a much smaller sample size (54 vs. 262 individuals), and the high prevalence might have been influenced by the fact that four of the five positive bats were caught in the same night at the same fruiting fig tree (Cottontail, pers. comm.) and might represent roost mates. O\u2019Mara et al. (2014)showed that U. bilobatum roost mates may pass on the information of a promising food source and might therefore share foraging sites and show group foraging behavior. The social organization of U. bilobatum might favor the transmission of TBHBV within a roosting group. Groups may consist of polygynous harems of 5\u201350 (Kunz 1982; Chaverri et al. 2010) individuals, with one male per 5\u201310 females, but the animals are also found to roost in multi-male or multi-female groups (Chaverri et al. 2010). Assuming a similar possibility for sexual transmission of TBHBV as in HBV, there are two general ways of transmission within a harem group: (1) the male is a chronic carrier, transmitting TBHBV onto the females, or (2) an infected female joins the harem, and passes the virus to the male, which thereafter infects the remaining females. Both hypotheses lead to a female-biased infection prevalence typical for polygynous mating systems (Ashby and Gupta 2015) as it was observed in this study, with females showing a higher prevalence (9.7%) than males (3.8%). Furthermore, chronically infected pregnant females with high viral load will most likely transmit the virus to their newborns during birth, which is a hallmark for all orthohepadnaviruses, including human HBV. Perinatal transmission will induce chronic infections in 90% of offspring (Gish et al. 2015). In conclusion, sex and reproductive state were significant factors affecting the probability of an infection with TBHBV.",

            "text": "In addition to these intrinsic factors, we identified forest cover as a significant external factor (Fig. 3). The loss of habitat and therefore also of natural roosting options changes the roosting behavior of U. bilobatum (Sagot et al. 2013). Their high flexibility, adaptability, and ability to roost in ornamental palms in close vicinity to humans (Rodr\u00edguez-Herrera et al. 2007; Sagot et al. 2013) and occasionally even under the eaves of houses (O\u2019Mara et al. 2017) allow them to persist in areas with relatively low densities of natural roosting options. Roosting under house eaves could offer energetic benefits by eliminating the necessity of building a new tent every few months (Chaverri et al. 2010). Loss of natural habitat and the corresponding native roost plants may therefore lead to higher densities of bats in areas with coconut palms, which are most often cultivated in and around villages (Chaverri et al. 2007; Sagot and Stevens 2012; Sagot et al. 2013). Higher densities may also lead to larger social groups, in which females might be more receptive to stress than males as they show higher cortisol levels when restrained (O\u2019Mara et al. 2017), possibly weakening the immune system (R\u00f8nsholt et al. 1998; Van der Poel et al. 2000), which coincides well with our observed female-biased infection prevalence. Lewis (1992) showed that groups in anthropogenic influenced areas are more stable due to this scarceness of possible roosts compared to natural habitats, favoring virus transmission within the group. Roosting in gardens and houses bring bats in close contact to humans, who, if noticing the bats, often attempt to expulse them by destroying their tents (Sagot and Stevens 2012; Streicker et al. 2012). However, this might result in raising infection levels among bats, as evicted bats subsequently try to enter other colonies, causing distress and raising fight frequency. Through enforced roost site changes, already infected bats may directly introduce TBHBV into healthy colonies (Kerth et al. 2002; Streicker et al. 2012) and may cause more rapid spreading in anthropogenic areas than in natural habitats.",

Many aspects, host sociality for example, remain unexplored, but could prove highly important in the propensity for disease transmission (Hayman et al. 2013; Luis et al. 2013). Although the number of sampled bats in our study was extensive, the low infection prevalence and therefore the low number of positive bats entering our models may limit the precision of our predictions. Nevertheless, our results are significant and we are confident that our interpretation is well supported. We demonstrate that the loss of natural habitat can promote the spreading of TBHBV and can increase the probability of U. bilobatum becoming infected with TBHBV. Anthropogenically altered habitats provide ideal circumstances for the spread of infection, for example, offering conditions promoting numerous, large roosting groups in close vicinity to each other, roosting conditions that typically avoided in pristine habitats lacking human disturbance. As demonstrated by Estrada-Pe\u00f1a et al. (2014), broad patterns of disease transmission can only be explained by the combination of environmental, biotic, molecular, and human socioeconomic phenomena. A robust understanding of the mechanisms promoting pathogen\u2013host relationships, critical for accurate predictions of disease ecology, requires multidisciplinary investigation of both host ecology and pathogen ecology.",
