            "text": "The recent emergence of a new strain of influenza, influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, has emphasized the need for a rapid, high throughput system for identifying viruses in respiratory specimens. The diagnosis must also be able to differentiate between influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 itself and other respiratory viruses that may appear as complications. An influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 infection might lead to hospitalization in an intensive care unit where the number of available beds is limited [Fuhrman et al., 2011]. Molecular diagnosis of viral infections has become the \u201cgold standard\u201d in hospital laboratories and has replaced increasingly cellular virus culture and direct immunoassays. While real\u2010time PCRs have improved biological management, the nucleic acid extraction step remains time\u2010consuming and fully automated extraction instruments are needed. High quality real\u2010time PCR assays to identify a broad range of viruses can only be performed on a high quality total nucleic acid extract.",

Previous studies on the quantification of EBV [Mengelle et al., 2008] and CMV [Mengelle et al., 2011] in whole blood found a good correlation between the MagNA Pure LC\u2122 system and the COBAS Ampliprep\u2122. Thus, these data show the importance of comparing the new extraction system, the MagNA Pure 96\u2122, with another highly automatic instrument that uses identical technology, the COBAS Ampliprep\u2122. For this purpose, total virus nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) was extracted from respiratory specimens with both instruments and then tested for several viruses (influenza A and influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, rhinovirus, enterovirus, adenovirus, varicella zoster virus, cytomegalovirus, and herpes virus types 1 and 2) by real\u2010time PCRs.",

Chan et al. compared two automatic extraction systems (the Nuclisens easyMAG and the Qiagen BioRobot 9604) with the manual QIAamp (Qiagen) extraction method. They found no difference in the sensitivities of all three methods. Furthermore, until recently the MagNA Pure LC\u2122 system has provided an easy\u2010to\u2010use platform for extracting various clinical specimens. But we believe this is the first report of using the MagnA Pure 96\u2122 instrument to extract nucleic acids from a large number of routine clinical respiratory specimens, including broncho\u2010alveolar fluids, throat samples, and nasopharyngeal samples that were collected in 1 week during the influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 pandemic. The results show that the two extraction systems performed very similarly on all the clinical respiratory specimens regardless the real\u2010time PCR technology used. Moreover, the methods performed similarly regardless of the structure of the viruses (DNA and RNA, with or without an envelope). The viruses tested can serve as models for all other viruses, including influenza B, respiratory syncytial virus, and coronaviruses. Some of theses viruses, such as varicella zoster virus, are rarely found in respiratory infections, but as this was a prospective study, all the items requested by the clinicians were tested.",

The advent of the MagNA Pure 96\u2122 has lead to huge changes in the organization of the laboratory. Two extractions a day are now run, so clearing all daily incoming clinical specimens. In addition, as elution volume is 100 \u00b5l, only a single extraction is needed even if several PCR tests are to be done. This greatly reduces the technician's hands\u2010on time and hence the cost of the entire PCR test. As most PCR assays are now carried out on the same day, the waiting time for results has decreased dramatically, as have the number of phone calls from clinicians.",

A batch of 96 samples can be extracted in less than 1 hr, which allows for very rapid molecular diagnosis and thus identification of viral pathogens. Operator time is reduced thanks to ready\u2010to use reagents that can be kept at room temperature. These features are all of great economic importance, in addition to providing rapid diagnosis and improving patient management.",
