Currently, RNAi has been shown to function in two distinct processes. The first is regulation of cellular gene expression via microRNAs (miRNAs). miRNAs represent a family of highly structured small non-coding RNAs that negatively regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level [4]. They are expressed as primary miRNAs (pri-miRNA) and processed by the proteins Drosha and Dicer into respectively a \u223c70 nucleotide stem-loop precursor miRNA (pre-miRNA), and the mature miRNA of 21\u201325 nts. Only one strand of the mature miRNA, the guide strand, is loaded in the RNA induced silencing complex (RISC). The guide strand targets RISC to the mRNA, where the complex hybridises to (partially) complementary sequences resulting in mRNA cleavage or translational inhibition (Fig. 1\n, left panel).",

Therefore, viruses are likely to affect cellular RNAi processes. Recent data indicate that viruses interact with RNAi mechanisms in various ways, illustrating genetic variation among different virus families. The antiviral RNAi response might represent a general phenomenon. To counter this response, viruses evolved RNAi suppressor proteins or RNA molecules with RNAi-modulating activity. A more distinct virus\u2013RNAi interaction is the recently reported inhibition of a retrovirus by the cellular miRNA 32 (miR-32). In contrast, hepatitis C virus (HCV) replicates with the help from the cellular miR-122, another example of specific virus\u2013RNAi interaction. We will discuss these complex virus\u2013host interactions. In addition, we will address the possibility of RNAi-based antiviral strategies.",

Upon infection, cells lacking components of the RNAi apparatus produce more GFP and infectious particles than the control cells. Furthermore, mutant cells with enhanced RNAi function were shown to produce less GFP. In this way, it was demonstrated that multiple genes required for RNAi are also required for resistance to VSV, suggesting a natural role for RNAi in the resistance to viruses.",

Recent studies on HIV-1 probably get the closest to an affirmative answer. Initial attempts to clone virally encoded siRNAs or miRNAs failed [39], but another group reported that an miRNA is encoded by the nef region of the HIV-1 genome [36], [37]. In addition, Bennasser and colleagues characterized a sequence in the HIV-1 genome that encodes a rare siRNA precursor: a hairpin structure composed of a 19 base pair perfectly complementary stem and a large loop [5]. This structure is processed by Dicer (or by a Dicer-like ribonuclease) into functional siRNAs that target the HIV-1 genome. It was reported the Tat protein functions as an RNAi suppressor protein that blocks the induced antiviral RNAi response by interfering with Dicer activity.",

The latter two RNA molecules may be resistant because their location within the nucleus makes them inaccessible to the cytoplasmic RISC. Similar findings have been reported for influenza virus and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). The genomic and antigenomic RNA duplexes of HDV also resist Dicer cleavage, which appears to be caused by the extended nature of this imperfect RNA duplex [14].

To counter this antiviral effect viruses have evolved strategies to avoid recognition by the RNAi machinery of the host. Many plant viruses encode proteins that interfere with one or more aspects of Dicer action and/or siRNA targeting [31], [42], [51], [52], [53]. These RNAi suppressors were first described as pathogenicity factors, and target the RNAi machinery at various steps along the silencing pathway, enabling the virus to accumulate to higher titers. Recently, RNAi suppressors have also been identified in several important human pathogenic viruses. For example, influenza virus NS1 protein, vaccinia virus E3L protein, HIV-1 Tat protein and the adenovirus virus-associated RNAs I and II (VA-RNAI and II) were shown to exhibit RNAi suppressor activity [2], [5], [30], [32]. This discovery suggests that RNAi functions as an innate antiviral defence mechanism in mammals similar to what has been described in plants and insects.",

The first example was recently provided for Epstein Barr virus (EBV), a large DNA virus of the herpes family that preferentially infects human B cells [40]. When the small RNAs from a latently EBV-infected Burkitt\u2019s lymphoma cell line were cloned, 4% of them originated from two regions of the EBV genome. A computational method was used to identify potential targets of these EBV-encoded miRNAs. Among the predicted targets were regulators of cell proliferation, apoptosis, transcriptional regulators and components of signal transduction pathways. Although these targets should be verified experimentally, it is striking that several of these genes have more than one binding site for a particular EBV-miRNA. Degradation of a cellular DNA polymerase was demonstrated experimentally [40]. Furthermore, the expression of the EBV-miRNAs was shown to differ in the lytic versus latent stage, suggesting tight regulation during viral infection. Intriguingly, the viral miRNAs could be involved in tumour formation and may explain how EBV hides so well. Other members of the herpesvirus family and other viruses with a large DNA genome could encode miRNAs in order to exploit RNAi for the regulation of host and viral expression.",

Apparently viruses can interact with cellular RNAi factors in various ways. Possibly, other viral of host cell mRNAs can also be positively affected by miRNAs. Two plant miRNAs have been demonstrated to interact with the 5\u2032 non-coding region of their respective targets mRNAs [10], but this has not yet been observed for animal miRNAs [4]. Another intriguing question is about the natural function of miR-122 in the liver, and whether that function is influenced by HCV infection. These results also have potential therapeutic relevance. First, knocking down miR-122 in the liver might counteract infection with HCV. Second, antiviral si/shRNA strategies could focus on the miR-122 target in the 5\u2032 non-coding region. This target may be highly accessible and is likely to be extremely conserved to maintain miR-122 interaction.

It is becoming increasingly clear that there is also an intricate relationship between viruses and the cellular RNAi machinery. As we mentioned earlier, miRNA regulated cellular gene expression and the antiviral siRNA activity appear to run along similar pathways (Fig. 1). We discussed examples in which cellular miRNAs inhibit and promote virus replication. Viral RNAi suppressor factors that block Dicer or siRNA function may affect cellular miRNA function in case they cannot discriminate between siRNA and miRNA processing. In that scenario, suppressors will not only inhibit the antiviral RNAi effect, but also interfere with cellular miRNAs function. Such suppressor induced changes in miRNA maturation will indirectly affect cellular gene expression, and may contribute to viral pathogenicity. In plants, the turnip mosaic virus RNAi suppressor protein HC-Pro blocks miR171 activity, resulting in abnormal plant development [26]. In human cells, adenovirus VA-RNAI was shown to interfere with miRNA biogenesis [2], [32]. For HIV-1, the Tat protein was shown to partially repress the processing activity of Dicer [5]. Indeed, the miRNA expression profile was recently demonstrated to differ in cells that express HIV-1 when compared to control cells [16]. This initial study was performed with cells transfected with an HIV-1 molecular clone, and should be repeated with virus infected primary human cells. It is conceivable that the downregulation of mature miRNAs may be due to the Dicer suppressive effect exerted by the Tat protein [5].",

TRBP was previously identified as HIV-1 TAR RNA-binding protein [19]. Two recent studies indicate that TRBP is a component that is required for RISC assembly and optimal RNA silencing mediated by siRNAs and endogenous miRNAs [16], [21]. TRBP had previously been assigned several functions, including inhibition of the interferon-induced (IFN)dsRNA-regulated protein kinase PKR and modulation of HIV-1 gene expression by association with TAR. The TRBP\u2013Dicer interaction raises the possibility of crosstalk between RNAi and IFN-PKR pathways, both in normal and virus-infected cells. Interestingly, many RNAi suppressors encoded by viruses are also inhibitors of the IFN-induced PKR, providing another overlap between these two pathways. The finding that TRBP is an essential component of the RISC complex raises several possible scenarios for HIV-1 interference with the RNAi pathway [20]. For instance, accumulation of HIV-1 RNA with 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 TAR motifs in virus-infected cells may trigger the depletion of TRBP, leading to inactivation of RISC and the RNAi machinery. This could facilitate a general suppression of RNAi by HIV-1, similar to the way in which adenovirus VARNAs block Exportin-5, Dicer and RISC.",

Tat may prevent this antiviral action. Any of these speculative models should incorporate the fact that TRBP contributes to HIV-1 replication [20].

There is some evidence suggesting that the genomic RNA present within an infecting virion particle is targeted for destruction, but it appears that new viral transcripts, synthesized from the integrated provirus, are more efficient targets. Most studies used chemically synthesized siRNAs that were transfected into cells either shortly before or after challenge with HIV-1. Despite the transient nature of such a transfection experiment, a single siRNA application is able to achieve relatively long-lasting suppression [47]. Other studies used transient transfection of siRNA-expression vectors. However, the development of efficient vector delivery systems capable of mediating stable siRNA expression in mature T lymphocytes or progenitor stem cells will be a minimal requirement for RNAi to be used as a therapeutic modality against HIV-1. Lentiviral vectors with a Pol III expression cassette are an efficient means to deliver anti-HIV siRNAs into haematopoietic precursor cells. In a recent report, the transduced human cells were allowed to differentiate in vivo in the SCID-hu thymopoiesis mouse model [3], and the mature T lymphocytes derived from this model resisted HIV-1 infection ex vivo.",

Potent inhibition was scored, but an escape virus variant appeared in prolonged cultures. Similar results were described by Das et al. using a lentiviral vector with an H1 unit expressing an siRNA against sequences in the nef gene [18]. The latter study described seven independent HIV-1 escape variants. The combined results convincingly demonstrate that inhibition was potent and sequence-specific, but also that HIV-1 is able to escape from the inhibitory action of a single siRNA. Boden et al. described a single revertant with a point mutation in the target sequence, and Das et al. described a large variety of escape routes (point mutation, double point mutation, partial or complete deletion of the target sequence). A deletion-based resistance mechanism seems impossible in case essential HIV-1 genes or critical sequence motifs are targeted. Thus, one should preferentially target essential sequences that are well conserved among HIV-1 isolates. Interesting targets with relatively little mutational freedom are the multiple overlaps in reading frames within the HIV-1 genome, including a triple overlap (tat\u2013rev\u2013env). Ideally, one should target more than one of these essential and well-conserved viral sequences. Such siRNA combination therapy (SIRCT) mimics the successful strategy to combat HIV-1 with multiple antiviral drugs, and should avoid the evolution of escape variants [6].",

            "text": "We recently discovered an alternative resistance mechanism that is not triggered by mutation of the target sequence. Instead, a mutation in the flanking sequences was selected, which was subsequently shown to induce a conformational change within the target sequence such that it is protected from RISC attack [54]. This finding indicates that it will not be very straightforward to predict viral escape routes. Nevertheless, one could make a first estimation of the chance of viral escape in a therapeutic setting with one or multiple siRNAs [6]. If we assume that an essential viral sequence is targeted, deletion is no option. Therefore, one and more likely two nucleotide substitutions are required per 19-nucleotide target sequence to obtain a fair level of resistance [18]. Assuming that 2-point mutations are needed to obtain complete resistance, and further assuming an error rate of the reverse transcriptase polymerase of 2 \u00d7 10\u22125, the chance of viral escape in a single replication cycle is 19 \u00d7 [(2 \u00d7 10\u22125)]2 = 1.44 \u00d7 10\u22127. Studies in the field of drug-resistance indicate that an untreated HIV-infected individual contains an effective viral population size of 104\u2013105\n[44], which means that most 1-nucleotide substitutions will already be present within the viral population. Starting in an untreated patient with a moderate viral load, this means that resistance is likely to occur. Thus, it may indeed be important to consider SIRCT [6]. With four effective siRNAs, the chance of viral escape drops to 2.1 \u00d7 10\u221214. In practice, this means that viral escape is impossible as long as viral suppression is complete. Even if several assumptions are wrong, the prospects are favourable that one can achieve effective and long-term viral suppression. An alternative strategy is to target unmutable host-encoded functions that are important for viral replication, but not essential for survival of the host cell.",

RNAi is a newly discovered mechanism that, through miRNA effector molecules, plays a pivotal role in the regulation of many genes, especially those at nodes of signaling pathways involved in such processes as development, metabolism, apoptosis and aging. It therefore comes as no surprise that viruses also encode miRNAs. In addition, host-encoded miRNAs have been reported to positively or negatively modulate viral replication. On their part, viruses can encode RNAi suppressors that protect against the cellular antiviral RNAi response, but that may also affect cellular gene expression. Certain viruses even have evolved to utilize that miRNA pathway to their own advantage. Nevertheless, a better understanding of the virus\u2013host interaction at the molecular level should allow us to develop an effective, durable and non-toxic antiviral therapy. RNAi-based treatments are quickly moving towards human patients, and the year 2006 should offer the first hints of how this highly publicized technique works in a therapeutic setting. Company-funded clinical trials in macular degeneration are under way, and targeting of transient viral infections such as pediatric respiratory illness caused by RSV are supposed to launch soon.
