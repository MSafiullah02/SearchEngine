It does not need evidence to make the scientific guess that given our population and social factors like overcrowding, poverty, class diversity, homelessness and stranded migrant population, the existing number of cases are much more than what has been detected. Even countries like the United Kingdom and United States (US), have mentioned that they are probably undercounting their cases by a factor of 12-15 (Cucinotta and Vanelli, 2020). US which definitely has a much more advanced and accommodative public health system has been in grim state with more than four lakh cases so far and nearly 13,000 deaths (WHO Situation Report, as on 8th April 2020). Millions have been jobless, and economies slashed. Does it not raise a doubt then that India, having 20 times more the population, has only been detected to have five thousand cases so far! It might foster sense of security and mental well-being in most of us, which will keep the ominous truth of 'viral case load' in the hidden shadows.",

This is a public health fact that we need to be prepared for without being in panic or fear mongering. Stress is natural during such times and that can be harnessed for positive action, knowing that this is how epidemics spread. Under-preparedness fosters increased stress, due to the added burden of uncertainty and fighting an unknown infection in the 'blind'. Also being considered as an \u2018infodemic\u2019 in this digital age, COVID-19 has led to a plethora of misinformation and rumors that have further added to the mass-fear and anxiety (Pennycook et al., 2020). The lockdown in that case is a welcome measure, as it was imposed at the epicenter of this pandemic in Wuhan, China. However, various marginalized population like the homeless, the daily wage workers and migrant laborers fell victims to it, as they were stranded away from their homes at crowded places without the basic and essential amenities of life. The standard precautions of social distancing and hygiene are impossible at these setups. Their needs are much more practical and reality-based struggling for the basic life amenities when the fear of death due to hunger and poverty is much more worrisome than the fear of the coronavirus.",

It totally depends on where COVID-19 is going to leave us, and its chronic impact on economy, quality of life and psycho-social outcomes on a global landscape. If the virus mutates to a less virulent form, or the increasing humidity or geographical sensitivity affects it for the better, we are lucky. But these are only speculations, with debatable evidence behind the same. Viruses do mutate, but it can go in either way in terms of virulence and hence the pathogenesis and severity of infection. If projections from Europe are applicable to India, the prevalence should be higher than 20 percent (Sahin et al., 2020). In other words, millions of affected cases and thousands of severe infections are projected in India, as happening in the countries of Italy, Spain and US. So far, the elderly and the immunocompromised have had the greatest vulnerability, accounting for most fatalities in India and thus projected risk is highest amongst the oldest old. What is more crucial is that, these cases are supposed to appear in the next two to four months window. As mentioned before, the fear of exhausting our resources leading to increased vulnerability to the social evils are much more rather than the threat of mortalities.",

The doctor patient ratio is 1: 1800 which falls short of the 1:1000 as recommended by WHO (Deo, 2013). This is even when we consider all the specialties, many of whom might not be adequately trained for infectious disease management. So the statistics alone are inadequate! Large, temporary hospital setups and maximum utilization of the district level healthcare and private resources need to be aggressively planned in the coming days. Accommodation of the patients is the biggest challenge in developing countries during a pandemic. As parks, stadiums, educational institutions and government buildings are being converted into COVID-19 isolation centres, the numbers are still inadequate for the projected rise in cases, should the infectious burden worsen. Eventually, it is not the virus that kills but the under-detection, lack of treatment, public chaos, competition over limited healthcare and mayhem as seen before during the Influenza epidemic in India (Sahin et al., 2020). We definitely hope such stage will never arise. However, it is better to over-react rather than stay under-prepared.",

History has shown that among all the catastrophic events to strike humanity including a nuclear fallout, pandemics like the Bubonic Plague, Spanish flu or SARS have always been of the highest impact. The probability factor is uncertain that makes it all the more difficult to prepare for them. Epidemiologists, virologists and public health experts have warned governments all over for an advanced preparedness. It needs to be at every level of health-service, policy making and their implementation. Mental health and psycho-social health are integral part of this preparedness, as pandemics affect the society at a large, more than just individuals. There were some policy changes made after the SARS, MERS and the Influenza outbreak, but pandemic preparedness in India has mostly been on the backseat (Kakkar et al., 2010). The emotional preparedness and timeliness of the lockdown could also have been better, with advanced sensitization to the impoverished sections of the society, who are vulnerable to any infection for that matter. Emotional health at all tiers needs to be integrated into the publci health infrastructure. However, it is also true that no amount of planning can prepare us for such a large-scale occurrence.",

However, the administration is trying with the best that it can and now it is the time to emotionally stand together, keeping a caring watch on our families, friends, relatives, neighbors, co-workers and employees. This includes the household help, security guards, vendors and basically anyone that you come across. Also, the vulnerable population includes not only the doctors and nurses but also all the allied workers on the frontline: the police, the volunteers, security personnel and people involved in testing and cleaning. Ideally, \u2018social distancing\u2019 is a misnomer and should be replaced by \u2018physical distancing\u2019. Mutual support can strengthen emotional bonds, which in turn helps coping and positivism. Such a crisis is the best time to increase our resilience using social integration and human values. The precautionary measures need to be followed and advocated. It is also better to distance from the social media to prevent \u2018information pollution\u2019. Rumor mongering is extremely harmful as misinformation can have detrimental effects on public health. One senseless forward can trigger a cascade of harmful reactions, if in wrong hands and especially during crisis.",
