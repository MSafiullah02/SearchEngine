Nutrition is often forgotten in the food security mandate. Thus, food and agriculture policies are generally less attuned to ensuring nutrition is central in their ultimate outcomes.",

For example, the relationship between population nutrition and chronic disease risk is often ignored in most agriculture policies,56 which was corroborated by other analyses.

These guidelines are quite detailed and visual and, in their development, involve a public consultation. A study that compared the 2005 U.S. dietary guidelines to the food system supply that is available for the country, found that food supply does not, on average, equal the recommended dietary guidelines.61 The volume supplied surpasses the volume required by some two-thirds in the case of grains, and by half for both fats and sugar, while the volume of protein supplied is more than twice as high as the amount required. Similarly, the amount of oil supplied is three times as high as the amount needed, while dairy supply exceeds requirements by one-fifth. Fruit supply stands at less than three quarters of the required amount. Only vegetables come close to the recommended levels. The authors of this study also found that this imbalance between supply and demand, or better, need, is even worse for the least developed countries.62 In addition, there is an issue with what dietary guidelines recommend to what is possible within the planetary boundaries. For example, increasing consumption of fish rich in omega three fatty acids may quickly deplete the natural marine resources that contain these essential nutrients. Thus, changing diets may have massive implications on our environment and planet. The IOM has recently recommended that U.S. dietary guidelines be more thoughtfully based on environmental as well as nutritional considerations and consider more sustainable diet options (see Chap. 10.1007/978-3-319-07542-6_10).63\n",

Conversely, the least expensive food alternatives are often also the least healthy and least sustainable\u2014ultra-processed, high in sugar and fat, and high in energy cost for every dollar spent.67 To some extent, this seemingly cheaper sticker price is due to the externalization of the food producers costs (see Chap. 10.1007/978-3-319-07542-6_16).

Agribusiness has had large positive effects on Brazil\u2019s economic growth and is powerful and well funded. Many stakeholders see the decision to prioritize agribusiness as diametrically opposed to promoting food and nutrition security.\nLand Reform\nMany stakeholders identified land concentration as a major hurdle to guaranteeing food and nutrition security among the most vulnerable groups in Brazil. While traditional and indigenous groups have access to social support programs, the right to land is critical for them to ensure long-term, sustainable food security. There has been progress toward family farming and settling of landless families since 2003, but the agribusiness model favors land concentration and, in recent years, land reform has been removed from the government\u2019s agenda.\nRegulation and Legislative Challenges\nCivil society plays a very important role in Brazil, and is in part responsible for many of the food and nutrition security advancements in the country, such as through the National Food and Nutrition Security Council (CONSEA). However, agriculture laws, as well as food and nutrition policies and regulations sometimes face powerful opposition from pro-agribusiness lobbyists and politicians in addition to wealthy national and transnational corporations (BigAg and BigFood). This is evidenced by the successful derailment of a regulation that intended to set limits on the advertisement of foods with low nutritional values to children.\n",

As we move forward into the post-2015 era, good practices and transferable lessons can be drawn from each country case study. The studies collectively highlight the importance of a supportive policy environment, well-developed human resources, and effective systems for planning, implementation, and monitoring impact for creating successful, nutrition-sensitive agriculture policies and programs.",
