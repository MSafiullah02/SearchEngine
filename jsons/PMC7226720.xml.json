            "text": "Pulmonary oedema (PE) is one of the major complications and therapeutic challenges in severe Plasmodium falciparum malaria. This condition is associated with acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [1]. The incidence of ARDS in adults with severe P. falciparum malaria ranges from 7.6 to 26.2% [2\u20135], with the mortality rate of 52.2\u201389.0% [2, 5, 6]. In addition, PE occurs in approximately 10\u201321% [1, 7, 8]. In P. falciparum malaria, PE is associated with inflammatory infiltrates consisting of mainly mononuclear cells, haemozoin deposit, the accumulation of macrophages, as well as parasite sequestration [9]. Recruitment of macrophages to the lung signifies an important immune response in the pathogenesis of ALI/ARDS [10]. Activated macrophages have been described as two functional subsets, namely classically activated macrophages (M1) and alternatively activated macrophages (M2) [11, 12]. M1 macrophages are considered as pro-inflammatory macrophages that produce pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as tumour necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and other mediators. M2 macrophages are typically anti-inflammatory macrophages and produce anti-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-10 and secrete growth factor such as transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-\u03b21) for tissue repair [12].",

Twenty-four cases from severe P. falciparum malaria were originally available for evaluation. Lung tissues from seven cases were inadequate for further studies. Of the 17 cases, they were classified into severe P. falciparum malaria with PE (n = 9) and non-PE (n = 8), according to histopathological findings. In addition, there were 6 normal lung tissues from control cases. Lung tissues were embedded and prepared for histopathological evaluation. Based on histopathological findings of oedematous fluid in the lung, lung tissues were divided into severe P. falciparum malaria with PE, non-PE and control lung tissues. Normal control lung tissues were obtained from patients who died from accidents, and showed no pathological changes in the lungs. The study protocol was reviewed and ethical clearance was obtained from the Ethics Committee of Faculty of Tropical Medicine, Mahidol University (MUTM 2017-054-01).",

The pathological changes of lung tissues were interpreted based on eight histological criteria in twenty low power fields (LPF) (200\u00d7) per slide, namely septal congestion, alveolar haemorrhage, alveolar oedema, hyaline membrane formation, parasitized red blood cell (PRBC) sequestration, malarial pigment, lung macrophages and infiltration of inflammatory cells [17]. Each variable was graded on a scale based on percentage of severity based on a previous study with modifications, as follows: no injury = 0, injury \u2264 25%/HPF = 1, injury > 25% and \u2264 50%/HPF = 2, injury > 50% and \u2264 75%/HPF = 3, and injury > 75%/HPF = 4 [18]. Lung macrophages and white blood cells (WBC) were quantified and graded as follows: no cell = 0, cells \u2264 25/HPF = 1, cells > 25 and \u2264 50/HPF = 2, cells > 50 and \u2264 75/HPF = 3, and cells > 75/HPF = 4. Subsequently, a lung injury score ranging from 0 to 32 points was calculated by adding the sum of each variable to determine the overall histopathological changes in lung tissues from malaria patients with P. falciparum. A score of 0 means absence of histopathological changes while a score of 32 signified the most severe histopathological changes. All histopathological parameters were examined in a blinded manner, without prior knowledge of the patients\u2019 clinical status. Two independent assessors (AK, PV) evaluated the histopathological specimens. If there were discrepancies of more than 2 grading variations, a third person (SG/CS) was requested to score the histopathological changes and the mean readings of the three assessors were taken.",

Antigen retrieval from lung tissues was performed by a microwave technique with 0.01 mol/L citrate buffer at pH 6.0 for 20 min. To reduce endogenous peroxidase activity, tissue sections were incubated with 1% H2O2 in PBS for 30 min at room temperature (RT) and rinsed in running tap water for 10 min. Lung sections were treated with normal goat serum for 30 min at RT to reduced non-specific background. To detect the surface makers on macrophages, lung sections were incubated with primary antibody: monoclonal mouse anti-human CD68 (1:100 optimal dilution, DakoCytomation\u00ae; Denmark), mouse monoclonal antibody CD163 (1:200 optimal dilution, Novocastra\u2122; Leica Biosystems Newcastle Ltd, UK), and rabbit polyclonal antibody CD40 (1:200 optimal dilution, Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., USA) in a moisture chamber overnight at 4 \u00b0C. Next day, tissue sections were extensively washed with PBS, and incubated with secondary antibody for 30 min at RT, then incubated with avidin-biotin complex (ABC) conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) (VECTASTAIN\u00ae ABC Kits; Vector Laboratories, USA) for 30 min at RT. After the removal of non-reacted secondary antibodies, all sections were incubated with DAB (3,3\u2032-diaminobenzidine) Peroxidase Substrate Kit (Vector Laboratories, USA) for 3 min. Finally, sections were counterstained with Mayer\u2019s haematoxylin, mounted with a coverslip and evaluated under a light microscope.

No difference in other clinical complications of severe malaria (cerebral malaria, jaundice/hepatic dysfunction, severe anaemia, severe metabolic acidosis, hypoglycaemia, shock and disseminated intravascular coagulopathy) was observed between the two groups (Additional file 1: Table S1).",

            "text": "PE is a common finding in ALI and can cause the lungs to develop into acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [24]. The activation of lung macrophages and release of cytokines are important mechanisms contributing to lung damage in patients with ARDS [19, 25]. Under various triggers, lung macrophages can be polarized into either classically activated (or M1) or alternatively activated (or M2) subtypes [26]. M1 macrophages can be stimulated by interferon (IFN)-\u03b3, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and granulocyte\u2013macrophage colony stimulating factor, causing upregulation of genes involved in pathogen clearance and an inflammatory response. M2 macrophages, on the other hand, are induced by interleukin (IL)-4 and IL 13 and cause upregulation of genes involved in wound healing, phagocytic activity and an anti-inflammatory responses [26]. The main secreting cytokines from M1 macrophages which contribute to ALI include tumour necrosis factor (TNF), IL-1\u03b2 and reactive oxygen species [27]. In malaria, an essential factor that can contribute to the pathogenesis of lung injury is haemozoin pigment present in the lung tissue. A previous study in an animal model reported that haemozoin pigment can activate pro-inflammatory mediators and is related to the occurrence of ARDS in mice [28]. The subsequent influx of inflammatory cells into the lung tissue damages endothelial cells and results in increased vascular permeability [29]. It is possible that haemozoin activated pro-inflammatory chemokines (i.e., IFN-\u03b3, CXCL 10), and cytokines (i.e., TNF, IL-6) [30] can contribute to M1 polarization in malaria, resulting in ALI/ARDS. Consequently, pathological changes of PE, pulmonary haemorrhage, further recruitment of inflammatory cells and hyaline membrane formation may occur. In addition, macrophages can adhere and interact with the epithelium of alveoli resulting in an increase in cytosolic calcium levels which can lead to apoptosis of epithelial cells and the release of TNF. This mechanism can further damage the pulmonary barrier resulting in PE [25].",

Similar findings were documented in mice lung infected with Escherichia coli [31], in lung-induced chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) [16], and in viral infection in mice [14]. In addition to M1 being associated with accumulation of haemozoin and the occurrence of acute lung injury, polarization of macrophages to the M1 subtype is responsible for controlling infectious diseases during the acute phase. In influenza virus infection, lung macrophages can polarize to M1 in the early stage and later present the M2b phenotype. Functionally, M1 macrophages are characterized by enhanced endocytic functions and enhanced ability to kill intracellular pathogens [32]. In Listeria monocytogenes infection, M1 macrophages were reported to be activated. These macrophages help prevent bacterial phagosome escape and stimulate intracellular killing of bacteria [31].",

This phenomenon is suggestive of a higher-level anti-inflammatory response in uncomplicated malaria in order to avoid disease complications [33]. Since lung samples from this study was available only once, at autopsy, no data on sequential M1/M2 shifts between early and late infection in human malaria is possible. Theoretically, at a later stage of malaria infection, after pathogenic factors are eliminated through therapeutic anti-malarial treatment and immune clearance of malaria parasites, lung macrophages may shift from a M1 phenotype to the anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype. The switching of macrophage polarity has been associated with transcriptional control [34]. M2 macrophages have an important role in lung tissue repair by limiting the levels of proinflammatory cytokines in the cellular space and producing anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-10 and IL-1 receptor antagonist [10]. M2 macrophages also remove necrotic cells and debris through phagocytic activity, which can be demonstrated in the malaria lung tissues as lung macrophages engulf haemozoin and fragmented PRBCs.",

The study showed M1 macrophage activation in ALI in severe P. falciparum malaria, which indicates disease severity. As M1 polarization prevails, more lung damage can occur. Further investigation on the pathways of the malaria-induced M1 phenotype is necessary to identify specific activators for M1 polarization that could be attenuated and factors that promote the anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype, in order to suppress the inflammation and improve clinical ALI in severe malaria patients.",
