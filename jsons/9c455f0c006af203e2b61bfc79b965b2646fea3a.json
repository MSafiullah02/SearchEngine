First and particularly during this pandemic, the optimized ergonomics of portable devices render daily tasks easier and swifter with increased productivity and staff safety. Wireless flat panel detectors are easy to handle, to install behind the patient and to sanitize. Acquisitions are directly sent wirelessly to the touch-panel computer workstation warranting immediate evaluation of image quality and if necessary, repetition of the acquisition. Patient worklist and acquired images are stored on the touch-panel computer workstation and can be sent directly to the picture archiving and communication system (PACS). Secondly, digital systems reduce radiation and simplify postprocessing. In our daily practice, we systematically obtain \"soft-tissue\" and \"hard\" post-treatment filters (Fig 1c-1d ) enhancing contrast and gray-scale. The first favors parenchymal analysis and tracks complications, while the second better displays positioning of monitor devices such as chest, tracheal or nasogastric tubes, and catheters.",
