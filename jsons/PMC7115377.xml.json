            "text": "Beside vaccination, therapeutic strategies to combat infectious diseases have mainly targeted some unique enzymes or components of viruses, bacteria and parasites. This approved and pathogen-directed approach, while highly successful in many cases [1], is faced with rising resistance to individual drugs or drug classes. This is also occurring in the field of influenza virus. Influenza epidemics and pandemics continue to be a global threat to human health [2]. Influenza therapy is currently restricted to two classes of virus-directed drugs: M2 ion channel blockers and neuraminidase inhibitors [2]. The first class suffers from global virus resistance and neurological side effects [3]. The alternative neuraminidase inhibitors can also induce resistance and only provides rather modest clinical outcomes [4]. This highlights the urgent need to develop new antiviral strategies with entirely novel action principles and reduced risk for drug resistance. An alternative concept is to design new molecules to target host cell factors that are being hijacked by the virus during its replication [5]. Host factor-directed antiviral therapy is increasingly recognized as a relevant approach to counteract viral resistance and provide broad-spectrum antiviral agents [[6], [7], [8]]. The study of virus-host interactions allows the identification of the mechanisms by which viral factors co-opt host cell functions and host regulatory mechanisms that influence disease progression and treatment outcome. These host factors may be potential drug targets for disease management. Host factors for influenza virus [9,10], RSV [11,12], dengue virus [13,14], and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) [[15], [16], [17], [18]] were recognized by transcriptomic and proteomic methods, providing more detailed biochemical insights into the replication strategies of these viruses. In general, host-directed anti-infective interventions may enhance host cell responses to pathogens, target disease-causing virulence factors, or stimulate innate or adaptive immune responses [19]. Today, different classes of anti-influenza agents are under development to target viral or cellular proteins/processes [2,9,20].",

We recently identified this enzyme as the molecular target of 1-aryl-4,6-diamino-1,2-dihydrotriazines, structurally related to the antimalarial drug cycloguanil (1a, Fig. 1\n) [21]. This class of host DHFR inhibitors possessed intriguing dual activity against influenza A and B viruses and RSV. For the most promising derivatives (11a, 13a, 14a and 16a: range EC50 = 0.015\u20130.10 \u03bcM), the potency against influenza B was comparable to that of zanamivir (antiviral EC50 = 0.060 \u03bcM) [21], a neuraminidase inhibitor that is globally advised for influenza therapy [22]. These DHFR inhibitors also exhibited nanomolar activity (mean EC50 \u223c0.008 \u03bcM) against RSV with a SI (ratio of cytotoxic to antiviral concentration) above 10,000 for compounds 11a, 14a and 16a, far surpassing the potency and safety profile of the anti-RSV drug ribavirin (EC50 = 5.8 \u03bcM, SI > 43).",

These new dihydrotriazines were designed in order to better explore the chemical space around these scaffolds that are well tolerated for targeting the host (human) DHFR enzyme, with a view to evaluate its effect on virus inhibition. The new compounds confirmed the inhibitory profile against influenza viruses, especially type B. In order to verify the host-factor DHFR as the molecular target also for the azaspiro dihydrotriazines, the most promising derivatives were assayed against the recombinant hDHFR. These investigations were accompanied by molecular modeling studies of the title compounds in complex with the hDHFR, which predicted the most important features underlying protein/ligand binding. These information suggested the key molecular interactions required to achieve pharmacological activity and helped to rationalize the observed SAR of dihydrotriazine-containing derivatives acting as host (human) DHFR inhibitors.",

Also the (imidazo-pyridazinyl) benzenesulfonamide derivative (10) has displayed a significant antiviral profile (mean EC50\u223c 54 nM and SI\u223c 339) against three single stranded +RNA viruses, such as human rhinovirus 1 (HRV1), coxsackie virus B3 (CVB3) and HCV (1 b-genotype), impairing the activity of phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase III\u03b2 (PI4KB) [7].

In order to verify the host factor DHFR inhibition as mechanism of action by which the novel azaspiro dihydrotriazines exploit their antiviral effect, the most potent compounds (4, 6 and 20) were assayed against the recombinant hDHFR enzyme, displaying sub-micromolar or low micromolar Ki values (Table 2\n). Interestingly, these compounds exhibited an inhibitory behaviour (Ki) on hDHFR comparable to the antiviral activity (EC50) showed against Influenza B virus: in fact, the most potent compound 6 (EC50 = 0.19 \u03bcM) provided the lowest Ki value equal to 0.53 \u03bcM, and the less effective compound 20 (EC50 = 3.0 \u03bcM) possessed the highest inhibition constant (Ki = 1.40 \u03bcM). Therefore, as previously demonstrated for cycloguanil-like dihydrotriazines [21], the host (human) DHFR was found to be the molecular target of the novel azaspiro dihydrotriazine derivatives.",

In the new compounds series, the nitrogen of the spiropiperidine nucleus allowed the study of the role of different functionalized side chains, to understand the chemical space for enhanced interactions within the hDHFR enzyme. Whereas the previous series of cycloguanil-like dihydrotriazines emerged as highly potent influenza B and RSV inhibitors displaying nanomolar activity, the novel azaspiro dihydrotriazines, that we presented herein, possessed lower antiviral activity. By enzyme inhibition assays a DHFR-mediated mechanism of action was also confirmed for the new compounds, as we previously demonstrated for cycloguanil-like dihydrotriazines. The two novel compounds with superior activity and selectivity against influenza B and RSV were characterized by the piperidine nitrogen bearing a H-bond acceptor moiety linked to an aromatic lipophilic groups, such as the p-tolylcarbonyl (4) or (4-fluorophenyl)carbamoyl ones (6), joined with the 1-phenyl azaspiro dihydrotriazine. Also compound 20 has been found as promising new hit, combining a methoxyethyl chain at N (1) with an ethylsulfonic group at spiropiperidine nitrogen. Thus, besides the previously studied cycloguanil-like dihydrotriazine derivatives, also the above adequately substituted azaspiro dihydrotriazines may represent valuable starting points deserving further structural optimization. The new SAR insights gathered from this study provide crucial information to further develop this class of host DHFR-directed antiviral agents.",

HEL 299 were infected after reaching confluency, i.e. at day 5 after seeding. The cell cultures were infected with virus at a multiplicity of infection of 100 CCID50 (50% cell culture infective dose, i.e. virus dose producing infection in 50% of inoculated wells; calculated by the method of Reed and Muench [32]. Simultaneously with the virus, serial five-fold dilutions of the test or reference compounds were added. To assess compound cytotoxicity, mock-infected plates were prepared in parallel, by adding medium instead of virus. The plates were incubated at 37 \u00b0C (or 35 \u00b0C in the case of influenza and coronavirus) during 3\u20136 days, or 10 days in the case of adenovirus. At that time, manifest CPE was visible in the untreated virus control with \u2264100% of the monolayer showing, dependent on the virus, cell rounding, shrinking, lysis or cell-cell fusion. Microscopy was performed to score the CPE (i.e. score 0, 1, 2, 3 or 4, corresponding to 0, 25, 50, 75 or 100% of the cells showing CPE). Microscopy was also done to monitor cytotoxicity, expressed as the minimum cytotoxic concentration, i.e. the tested compound concentration causing minimal changes in cell morphology such as rounding, shrinking or lysis. In the case of influenza, the CPE assay was complemented by the formazan-based MTS cell viability assay (CellTiter 96\u00ae AQueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay from Promega) For HIV, the similar MTT method was used [31].",

Each inhibitor compound was firstly dissolved in DMSO (2% v/v) in order to have an initial concentration equal to 10 mM. Each of them was assayed in steady-state conditions at six point-concentration values equal to 1-2-4-8-16-32 \u03bcM, in duplicate and the respective inhibition percentage have been calculated. From the resulting inhibition percentages at each different inhibitor concentration and, assuming a competitive inhibition for the assayed compounds panel, it was possible to calculate the IC50 values from the Dixon plot 1/V vs [I], using the equation IC50 = ((1/0.5 \u2219 v0) \u2212 m)/q, where v0 is the rate of hydrolysis of the reporter substrate (v0 being the rate measured in the absence of inhibitor), q the y axis intercept and m the slope of the resulting linear regression. From resulting IC50 data, the Ki values were calculated by the equation Ki = IC50/(1+[S]/Km), considering a Km value for DHF substrate equal to 5 \u03bcM and a concentration value of 60 \u03bcM. The Km values of hDHFR enzyme for both substrates (DHF and NADPH) have been measured (see Fig. 1S). The inhibition assay was performed considering a final volume equal to 100 \u03bcL. In details, the several reagents were added in this following order: TES buffer, hDHFR enzyme at concentration of 0.42 \u03bcM, inhibitor compound at each single evaluated concentration, DHF substrate at concentration of 60 \u03bcM, ultrapure water to volume of 100 \u03bcL and, at the end, NADPH was added to the reaction mixture, at concentration value equal to 120 \u03bcM, for starting the catalytic reaction.
