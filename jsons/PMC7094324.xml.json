Vaccines are typically composed of attenuated or inactivated microorganisms or viruses [1], or their fragments [2], [3], [4], [5]. Since the development of the first vaccine two hundred years ago [6], vaccination has become one of the most popular interventions against a variety of infectious diseases. Moreover, a vaccine is the only available choice to combat infection where no effective drug treatment exists (e.g. Poliomyelitis) [7]. Compared to classical drugs, which require multiple doses, the long-term protection against specific pathogens or diseases makes vaccines a more cost and time effective choice. Additionally, in comparison to drugs, vaccines have typically lower toxicity, (especially as they are normally used as a single dose treatment) and mass vaccination can significantly control the spread of infectious diseases.",

Prophylactic vaccines usually offer long-term protection against infectious diseases. In contrast to prophylactic vaccines, which usually induce humoral immune responses (antibody production), therapeutic vaccines are designed to stimulate a cytotoxic T lymphocyte response to eliminate cells that are already infected [8], [9], [10]. Therapeutic vaccines are a growing pharmaceutical sector. Sipuleucel-T (Provenge\u00ae) was approved by Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2010 for prostate cancer [11], [12] and talimogene laherparepvec (T-VEC) (Imlygic\u2122) was introduced against metastatic melanoma in 2015 [13], [14], [15].",

Traditional vaccines based on attenuated and inactivated pathogens may revert to virulent form [16], [17], cause autoimmunity or strong allergic responses [18], [19]. Additionally, the production and stability of this type of vaccine is often challenging. Subunit vaccines contain a small fragment of the whole pathogenic organism, for instance a recombinant protein, peptide, carbohydrate [20], [21], [22], [23]. Recombinant protein-based vaccines cause fewer adverse effects, but the difficulty with protein extraction and possible contamination during production are significant disadvantages. Recombinant vaccine can also trigger undesired immune responses. To avoid these obstacles minimal fragment of protein caring immunological information (peptide epitope) can be used for vaccine design [3]. However, peptide-based vaccines still have their own Achilles\u2019 heel. Peptides themselves are usually not immunogenic [3], [24]; therefore, the use of immunostimulating agents (adjuvants) are essential for the success of this vaccine formulation [25].",

The first approach uses external forces like grinding, milling, or high pressure to break down the original material [49], [50], [51]. This process adds additional complexity to producing a nanostructure and the harsh conditions used to break down the initial component may damage the antigen. Nanostructures produced by this method typically have a low loading capacity and are often not biodegradable and thus may accumulate in the human tissues.

The conjugation between polymer and peptide was crucial to induce immune responses as physical mixture of polymer and antigen did not induce antibody production. These nanoparticles were also able to induce high IgG titers after intranasal administration [70]. This antibody was able to partially opsonize one of the common GAS strains. Interestingly, when polymer 2 (Fig. 2) was conjugated to J14 epitope, the conjugate formed larger nanoparticles (\u223c500 nm) than their 4-J14 counterpart [71]. The larger particles induced significantly lower IgG titers than the CFA-adjuvanted control or 4-J14 (20 nm). Finally, a small library of polyacrylates 1\u20134 were investigated, which upon conjugation with peptide bearing J14 epitope and pan DR epitope (PADRE) universal T-helper (used to target the immunologically diverse \u201coutbred\u201d human population) formed large nanoparticles (100\u20131000 nm) [72]. All of them induced a strong humoral immune response, equipotent to that of CFA, despite the relatively large size of the particles. These antibodies efficiently killed clinical GAS isolates in opsonization experiments. Thus, the polyacrylate-polymer-based delivery system was an effective means of inducing a strong humoral immune response in both inbred and outbred mousel model.",

Therefore, three modified epitopes, 8QSer (QAEPDRAHYNIVTFSSKSD), 8QLys (QAEPDRAHYNIVTFSKKKK), and 8Qmin (QAEPDRAHYNIVTF) were designed and conjugated to the polymer 3. The polymer-peptide conjugates were self-assembled in water to form small nanoparticles (\u223c26 nm, 3\u20138QLys), big nanoparticles (\u223c530 nm, 3\u20138QSer) and microparticles (>1 \u03bcm, 3\u20138Qmin).

Conjugate 4\u20138Qmin also had the most efficient uptake by APCs and stimulated strong CD4+ and CD8+ T cell activation.

Perrier and colleagues conjugated two different length epitopes (GSTA and GVTSAPDTRPAPGSTAPPAH) from extracellular variable number tandem repeat region of cancer-associated glycoprotein MUC1 to poly(n-isopropyl acrylamide) by CuAAC reaction, respectively, to produce vaccine candidates [81]. The vaccine candidates were able to self-assemble into 20 nm and 130 nm nanoparticles, respectively. However, the efficacy of these nanoparticles was not confirmed in an immunization experiment. Hubbell and coworker developed a poly(ethylene glycol)-stabilized poly(propylene sulfide) core nanoparticle (PEG-PPS) polymer that self-assembled to form 25 nm nanoparticles [82]. When ovalbumin (OVA) antigen was conjugated to the PEG-PPS nanoparticles via a disulfide bond, the particle size increased to 35 nm. Upon the intradermal immunization, this vaccine candidate induced higher antibody titres but lower cytokine production than soluble antigen alone. Keller et al. also conjugated OVA to self-assembled amphiphilic diblock copolymers poly(HPMA-co-pyridyl disulfide methacrylamide (PDSMA))-b-(PAA-co-poly(dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate)-co-butyl methacrylate(BMA)) to form 30 nm (pH = 7.4) nanoparticles [83]. In this case, the polymer was allowed to self-assemble before OVA protein was conjugated to the particle via a disulfide bond. The conjugate was more efficiently taken up by APCs and, after subcutaneous immunization, induced stronger interferon gamma (IFN-\u03b3) production (a correlate of T cell activity) than a physical mixture of OVA protein and carrier.",

Indeed, relationship between degree of polymerization and size of self-assembled polymer nanoparticle was reported [84]. Additionally, the conjugation between the polymer and specific epitopes often produce products with variable degree of substitution. Although non-biodegradable polymers can form stable nanoparticles, the potential in vivo toxicity of this type of material must be considered. In the case of biodegradable polymers, the properties (for example size, charge, etc.) of nanovaccines may change before the vaccine can reach its target in the body, and thus such vaccine may not induce the desired immune response [3].

One of most intensively studied lipidic delivery systems, the lipid-core peptide (LCP), was first proposed in 1993 by Toth et al. (Fig. 3\n) [87]. This system incorporated peptide epitopes, a branching moiety, and lipids (e.g. 5) linked together by covalent bonds to produce a single-molecule vaccine candidate. Similar to other amphiphilic conjugates, LCP-based vaccine candidates could self-assemble into nano- or microparticles under aqueous conditions [88], [89], [90] (Fig. 3). Moreover, the lipidic moiety in LCP is recognized by TLR2, thus has self-adjuvanting properties [91], is preferentially taken up by APCs, and induced strong immune responses against the incorporated antigens [92], [93]. For example, Fuaad et al. synthesized an LCP-based vaccine candidate against schistosomiasis carrying an epitope (p2, KQAEDKVKAGPTDEIQKINAKQLEDKVK) derived from cathepsin D hemoglobinase [94], [95]. The conjugate self-assembled into nanoparticles with diameters of 30\u201380 nm. The p2-LCP induced high IgG titers after subcutaneous injection, similar to those triggered by the positive control: a CFA-adjuvanted p2 epitope. Moreover, the anti-p2 antibodies neutralized the enzymatic activity of the Schistosoma cathepsin D.",

Protease Na-APR-1 was chosen as the target antigen because of its involvement in the hookworm digestive system. A neutralizing B cell epitope (A291Y, AGPKAQVEAIQKY) from this protein was chosen as the peptide epitope for conjugation into the LCP system. Several LCP vaccine candidates were synthesized with varying levels of branching. The A291Y epitope was modified to adopt helical or \u03b2-sheet conformations. All compounds were able to self-assemble into nanoparticles with diameters ranging from 12 nm to 43 nm. Interestingly, only the epitope that retained its \u03b2-sheet conformation when conjugated to the LCP was able to induce production of antibodies that recognized the parent protein. This result indicated the importance of epitope conformation for peptide subunit vaccine development. Importantly, both series of vaccine candidates that targeted hookworm and Schistosoma did not induce any hemolytic effect and were not toxic in vitro even at a high concentration (100 \u03bcM) [95], [97].",

All the conjugates were able to self-assemble into particles with very distinct sizes, ranging from a few nanometers to submicron/microparticles. LCPs that bore hydrophilic epitopes formed small nanoparticles, while the incorporation of more hydrophobic peptides into LCP triggered the formation of larger particles. Thus balance between hydrophilic and hydrophobic properties of LCP component was crucial to controlling the size of the resultant nanoparticle.",

Smaller nanoparticles (5\u201310 nm) were taken up more efficiently by APCs and strongly enhanced APC-maturation to generate robust immune responses, in comparison to bigger particles (\u223c100 nm) [100].

However, the resultant compound formed nanoparticles instead of the expected nanofibers and did not induce significant IgG production in mice when compared with PBS. The poor immunogenicity of the construct might be related to the low dose used for the immunization study (30 \u03bcg in comparison to 300 \u03bcg typically use for Q11 conjugates) [117], [119]). Interestingly, when two copies of lipid moiety 5 were conjugated to Q11-J14 (or J14 alone), the formed nanoparticles (at 30 \u03bcg dose) induced high antibody titers, similar to those triggered by J14 emulsified with CFA. Therefore, the fibrillizing peptide\u2019s self-adjuvanting ability was weaker than that of the lipids. Recently, poly-\u03b2-branched amino acids were also suggested as delivery platform for vaccines [122]. It was demonstrated that B cell epitopes derived from GAS M protein formed water soluble molecules when conjugated to valine-rich isopeptides (depsipeptides). However, upon change in pH from acidic to neutral, the isopeptides undergo an O-N acyl migration reaction to form the linear \u201cparent\u201d peptide. This peptide adopted a \u03b2-sheet conformation and promptly aggregated into fibrils. The immunogenic properties of these fibrils have not been reported yet.",
