This letter aims at offering an alternative viewpoint on the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying SARS-CoV2 neuroinvasion. As elegantly reported by the Authors, direct neuroinvasion via hematogenous spread or migration through the olfactory tract are possible infection routes to the Central Nervous System (CNS). However, the virus could also gain access to the CNS from the periphery and, notably, the brainstem invasion via the vagal afferents from the lung and upper airways has been postulated in COVID-19 patients (Li et al., 2020) .",

Zhou et al. (2017) showed that in Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) the enteric involvement could precede the respiratory infection and observed brain infection in intranasally injected mice with MERS-CoV. More surprisingly, they also described increased viral load in brains from infected mice by intragastric inoculation. In these mice, indeed, direct intragastric gavage spread infectious virions in both lung and brain homogenates 5 days after the inoculation.",
