The other smear was highly cellular and consisted of many bare nuclei and moderate numbers of intact epithelial cells in a peripheral blood background (Figure 1B and Figure 1C). The epithelial cells were present primarily in small groups or clusters and had round, centrally placed, dark purple nuclei. Nuclei had moderately stippled chromatin and contained single prominent to discrete nucleoli. Cytoplasm was circumferential, faintly lavender\u2010gray, and finely granular, with faint but distinct cytoplasmic borders. Some cells contained numerous round intracytoplasmic vacuoles (Figure 1D). Mild anisocytosis and anisokaryosis were observed. The cytologic findings were suggestive of a neuroendocrine tumor, derived from amine precursor uptake and decar\u2010boxylase (APUD) cells. Based on the location of the tumor and cytologic findings, chemodectoma was the tentative diagnosis. Other differential diagnoses included ectopic thyroid gland neoplasia and thymoma. The lack of tyrosine granules and the lack of lymphoid cells made these diagnoses less likely.",

A right fifth intercostal space thoracotomy was performed. Upon opening the thorax, another 300 mL of chylous fluid was removed. The mass, located just cranial to the heart near the entrance of the vena cava, was dissected and removed. Upon exploration of the thorax, no other masses were found and the lungs appeared normal. The cat died suddenly the following morning; necropsy was not performed. The mass removed at the time of surgery was submitted for histopathology.",
