The challenge is to differentiate between primary hematologic emergencies that require specific interventions and abnormalities secondary to other disease conditions. The purpose of this chapter is to summarize some of the most common hematologic emergencies seen in critically ill children that are associated with red blood cell (RBC), white blood cell (WBC) or platelet disorders. Transfusion medicine, oncologic emergencies, and coagulation disorders are discussed in other chapters. Of importance, many patients admitted for other reasons may have underlying disorders of elements of blood. It is beyond the scope of this chapter to go into detail about many of these disorders. The reader is kindly referred to books on pediatric hematology. As a consequence, it is therefore necessary for the pediatric critical care physician to collaborate with the pediatric hematologist when managing such patients.",

The majority of these conditions are chronic, with the exception of bone marrow failure affecting a single or even multiple cell lineages causing pancytopenia. The most common cause of acquired pancytopenia in the PICU is leukemia \u2013 either at presentation or as a consequence of chemotherapy or irradiation. Alternatively, many drugs often used in the PICU (e.g., antibiotics, ibuprofen, captopril and phenytoin) and infectious agents such as Parvovirus B19, hepatitis virus, Ebstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, tuberculosis and human immunodeficiency virus are important causes of bone marrow failure. Of importance, pancytopenia may present as sepsis with bruising, hemorrhage, pallor and fatigue. Symptoms develop usually gradually, but aplastic crisis can ultimately result in cardiovascular collapse. Peripheral blood smear will show normocytic anemia with a low or absent number of granulocytes and platelets. Although many cases are mild and self-limiting, supportive therapy such as eliminating identifiable causative toxins or treating underlying infections or malignancy is indicated. Transfusion is indicated when there is cardiovascular compromise, though as discussed in the previous chapter, there are no standard threshold criteria for transfusion that can be applied in every situation.",

            "text": "Acute splenic sequestration crisis is characterized by a sudden pooling of blood in the splenic sinusoids resulting in severe anemia. It typically occurs in children between 10 and 27 months of age, though it can also occur in young infants. It is relatively uncommon in older children because they develop functional asplenia over time, caused by repeated infarctions and subsequent fibrosis of the spleen, or autosplenectomy. Acute splenic sequestration crisis often occurs during bacterial or viral infection. Symptoms can range from mild to severe and include splenomegaly and symptoms of intravascular volume depletion. Laboratory investigations show an acute drop in Hb (>2 g/dL), reticulocytosis, thrombocytopenia, and leucopenia. The mainstay of treatment is to restore circulating blood volume and hemodynamic stability through infusion of volume expanders, and by repeated blood or exchange transfusions. One group of investigators has reported substantial mortality (35 %) when the Hb level dropped > 4 g/dL. Performing a splenectomy after a first crisis is controversial because of the infectious risks associated with splenectomy. Alternatively, close long-term monitoring of the child may avoid the need for splenectomy.",

Pulmonary microvascular sequestration of sickled RBCs initiates ACS, leading to acute lung injury (ALI) or even ARDS necessitating mechanical ventilation [19]. Clinical symptoms include fever, (productive) cough, chest pain, dyspnea, hemoptysis, and hypoxia. Of note, these symptoms may not be present initially but frequently develop during disease course in response to other precipitating events. Laboratory investigations show leukocytosis and presence of mainly isolated upper or middle lobe consolidations on chest radiograph. Pleural effusions are less common, in contrast with adults. Repetitive episodes of ACS may have significant long-term consequences such as pulmonary fibrosis, pulmonary hypertension, or cor pulmonale. Pulmonary hypertension in ACS is associated with increased mortality in adults, but this does not seem to be the case for children and adolescents [20].",

Treating the infection prevents hypoxia and acidosis, two important risk factors of sickling; prevention of infarction minimizes pain and hypoventilation (which in itself is a risk for pulmonary infection). Therefore, conventional treatment includes oxygen, intravenous fluid hydration, broad-spectrum antibiotics, pain medications and transfusion therapy. Transfusion alone often results in significant clinical improvement [22]. Exchange transfusion aimed at decreasing HbS <30 % is indicated when the patient is severely hypoxemic or has widespread pulmonary infarction. Bronchoconstriction needs to be treated, if present. Adjunctive therapeutic interventions have emerged including corticosteroids and nitric oxide (NO). Dexamethasone limited the severity in one small study of 43 patients, but was also associated with increased rehospitalization after 72 h [25]. The use of NO in critically ill children with ACS has so far only been described in case reports; hence its routine use cannot be recommended.",

By the age of 20 years, approximately 11 % of all patients will have suffered from infarcts, most frequently resulting from stenosis of large cerebral arteries (mainly the distal internal carotid artery and the proximal middle cerebral artery) [27]. Strikingly, approximately 15\u201325 % of patients with SCD have silent cerebral infarction [28]. Recent or recurrent ACS is a significant risk factor for the later development of stroke, which suggests that repeated damage to the endothelium may contribute. Abnormal cerebral flow on transcranial Doppler (TCD) ultrasound seems to be another risk factor in children [29]. Older children and adolescent suffer more often from hemorrhagic stroke caused by ruptured aneurysms. Importantly, chronic transfusion therapy in children with SCA significantly decreased the occurrence of CVAs [30, 31]. The diagnosis of CVAs in patients with SCA is not different from other patients with CVA. Emergency management includes adequate oxygenation and exchange transfusion (targeted towards HbS <20 %) [32].",

Children with HUS frequently present with acute renal failure. Other features include bowel involvement mimicking acute abdomen and central nervous involvement including seizures or altered consciousness.

Patients become symptomatic when the enzyme activity is less than 60 %. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase handles oxidative stress in the erythrocyte. It catalyzes the reduction of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP) to NADPH in the hexose-monophosphate shunt, which in turn converts glutathione disulfide to reduced gluthathione. Gluthathione is a scavenger for oxygen radicals. Patients with G6PD deficiency may present with severe acute hemolytic anemia caused by stressors such as drugs (Table 20.7), infection or notably ingestion of fava beans.

Twenty percent of HLH is familial and associated with abnormalities of a natural killer cell-derived cytotoxin (perforin). HLH is characterized by aggressive destruction of RBCs and other blood elements by macrophages in bone marrow, liver and spleen. Clinical symptoms vary and are similar to the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS).

Stress mobilizes neutrophils from the bone marrow into the circulation or shifts marginated neutrophils. These are circulating neutrophils that were not active but can be mobilized in times of stress. True neutrophilia results from infection (both bacterial and viral), the band form is considered to be very suggestive for bacterial infection and thus routinely used in daily critical care [45]. In severe infections, neutropenia may occur because of insufficient formation of new neutrophils. Leukemoid reactions (i.e. neutrophils > 50,000 cells/microL) can be triggered by various diseases but can only be discriminated from true leukemia through laboratory studies including marrow histology. Of particular concern are children with trisomy 21 who initially may have leukemoid reactions that develop into myeloid leukemias. Lymphocytosis is classically known to occur in Bordetella pertussis infection and following viral infection, whereas lymphopenia is often transient resulting from viral, fungal or parasitic infections. Yet, one should be aware of chronic underlying diseases including HIV infection. Eosinophilia is associated with allergic conditions or parasitic infections.
