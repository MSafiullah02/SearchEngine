Only when the most serious rejection hurdles and viral risks have been eliminated, can the practice really show whether complete pig organs can fulfil their replacement function as desired, or whether they will simply act as a short-term transition for the transplantation of human organs. This will obviously vary according to the organ in question: the heart has a less complex biochemical interaction with the body than the kidneys or liver. But this doesn't detract from the fact that more research is definitely needed in the area of xenotransplantation, however much the opinions of opponents and proponents differ. Maybe other options, such as organ breeding using stem cells, will catch up with the \"spare pig parts\" possibility before it comes into practice. This is surely more likely now that we have come to the end of the Bush era, when ethical considerations got in the way of federal financing for most research involving human embryonic stem cells. With the arrival of President Obama, change is in the air.

            "text": "early experiences were followed by many other similar primitive experiments. The first person to describe it as a transplantation was the Scottish surgeon John Hunter in 1778, when he wrote of a transplantation of a human tooth to the comb of a cockerel. Going back many centuries before Christ there were already descriptions of transplantation experiments with people. For example, Susrata, an Indian surgeon, was said to have used pieces of skin, about 600 years before the calendar era, to replace noses that had been cut off (often as a punishment). The most notorious example of early transplantations is probably 'the miracle of the black leg' from the 3rd century AD. In Rome two Syrian doctors, Cosmas and Damian, amputated the gangrenous leg of a verger. They attached in its place the leg of a dead black man. All these early attempts were transplantations from human to human (allotransplantation); all were probably not very successful, even though the species barrier had not been crossed. However, what they SOMETHING WENT WRONG YOU'RE SORRY? I'M SORRY, THERE WAS A SMALL MIX UP WITH YOUR ALLOTRANSPLANTATION. Xenotransfusions are also centuries old. The transfusion of lamb's blood to a 15-year old boy on 15 June 1667 is the first documented account of such a procedure. This was performed by the French doctor Jean-Baptiste Denis, King Louis XIV's physician, and the surgeon Paul Emmerez in Paris. Less than half a year later, on 23 November, Richard Lower carried out the same experiment in London on the 22-yearold Arthur Coga, also successfully. Several other transplantations followed, but with less success, and on 10 January 1670 they were banned by the French",

Blood groups are determined by the nature of the sugar chain of the red blood cells(Figure 12.1). However, these blood group determinants are not only found in red blood cells; they are also present in most organs, cells and tissues in the body. In pig organs, as well as in the pig cells that line the inside of the pig's arteries, there are blood group determinants, which are recognised by our immune system as foreign, and for which we So our blood reacts directly to the pig organ, resulting in hyperacute rejection (Reaction 1).Up until the turn of the century, getting around this immune reaction by modifying the blood group determinants in the pig was more of a theoretical than a practical or feasible solution. That's why, at the beginning of the 1990s, Imutran, a subsidiary of the pharmaceutical giant Novartis, tried a different approach. Researchers there succeeded in genetically modifying pigs so that they produced a human protein that could block the immune reaction between pigs' organs and human blood (Reaction 3). Testing with apes showed that the hyperacute rejection did indeed fail to occur. And yet, the pig organs failed in the long run. Preventing a hyperacute immune reaction was clearly not the only challenge. At a later stage the body throws in a whole army of antibodies and different processes into the fight to take out the 'intruders'.Even when there is a \"perfect match\" between human donor and recipient (Textbox 12.6), a transplant only succeeds by at least temporarily suppressing the immune system with medication. However, it is still not known whether this medication is effective enough in the case of a xenotransplantation. Which is why there is lots of research taking place into these complicated immune processes, in order to better understand them so that more effective means to combat them can be developed.

            "text": "there's a plan in place should anything go wrong.\" In an interview in the same year, Jan IJzermans, a transplant surgeon at the Erasmus University Medical Centre in Rotterdam, summarised the facts: \"The problem is that the discussion is still vague, because there's no real idea of how great the dangers are. We have to weigh up the interests of the individual patient who could be saved with a donor organ, and the risk of a new epidemic. In contrast to many other controversial medical procedures, however, xenotransplantation cannot be dealt with simply as a personal choice, if the possibilities are there. Anyone with a pig's heart or kidney may constitute a risk for the entire health of the public.\" At the turn of the last century, the Dutch Foundation for the Consumer and Biotechnology used a subsidy from the Ministry of Public Health, Welfare and Sport (VWS) to organise a public debate on xenotransplantation. EXERCISES FOR PIGS... ONE OF THE ABSURD ASPECTS OF XENOTRANSPLANTATION? The aim of the debate was three-fold: to give the public information, let them form an opinion on the basis of this information, and then assess the opinion. On 10 November 2000 the bioethicist Egbert Schroten (University of Utrecht) and the then VWS minister Mrs Els Borst, opened this debate called Should xenotransplantation be allowed? It followed an information campaign on xenotransplantation that began in December 1999. During that time the press also devoted a lot of attention to this subject. In the first months of 2001 citizens were able to go and discuss xenotransplantation in various locations around the country. In addition, the science theatre Pandemonia staged the play \"Dierbaar Leven\" (loosely translated this means 'life is precious', but there is a double meaning in the Dutch since \"dier\" means animal) about xenotransplantation. The idea behind this was to get young people interested in the topic. There was a website (no longer available) allowing for a debate on the subject. The public debate was concluded at the end of April 2001 with a final meeting. In mid-2001 the final report was published by the foundation. The summary and conclusions are available online 84 , unfortunately only in Dutch, but the gist of these is as follows. About half the people who interactively took part in the debate had no particular opinion for or against xenotransplantation. Proponents point mainly to the possibility of saving human lives and solving the problem of donor shortages. Opponents place more emphasis on the \"makeability\" of the body -the extent to which we are ready to interfere with the body. The unnaturalness of the procedure, the crossing of human and animal, and possible adverse consequences for quality of life, were also important considerations.",

Deactivating a gene entirely is always a complicated process, which until recently only had a reasonable chance of success in less complex animals such as mice, resulting in so-called \"knockout\" mice. Since 1992, however, researchers have been working hard on the genetic modification of pigs for the purposes of xenotransplantation. In their review 'Xenotransplantation: The next generation of engineered animals' d'Apice and Cowan (2009)    address the questions: What to remove? What to add? And how to do it? In their final section \"Horses for courses?\" they end with: \"Sounds familiar \u2026 so maybe a hurdler can run on the flat? Our approach is to try to build a multitalented pig and put him over a few different courses.\"As mentioned previously, the English company Imutran (Cambridge) began research in the early 1990s on the genetic modification of pigs with a human gene. The gene in question codes for the protein hDAF (human decay-accelerating factor), one of the proteins that inhibits the so-called complement activation in humans(Siegert, Van Es, & Daha, 1996).Complement activation is the result of the cascade-like interaction of plasma proteins and membrane-bound proteins. There is a total of approximately 30 proteins in the complement system. The complement system traces intruders in the bloodstream and destroys them by drilling through their cell membranes. In a transplanted organ they bind to the endothelial cells, the 'inner lining' of the blood vessels. These cells are immediately destroyed. As a result coagulation factors are released from the underlying cell layers, causing the blood vessels to be blocked within minutes. Pierson III et al. (2009) have nicely pictured and described this process in their invited review article \"Current status of xenotransplantation and prospects for clinical application\" (Textbox 12.4). The complement system has a number of safety markers where the induced reaction can be stopped (this is necessary if a complement factor binds to the body's own structure); hDAF marks one of these points. This also applies to proteins coded as CD59 and MCP, as well as hDAF membrane-bound proteins 79 .On 23 December 1992 the first hDAF transgenic pig was born; it was named Astrid. Three years later the American company Nextran produced transgenic pigs that expressed two of this type of protein, hDAF 79 www.ntvg.nl/node/290588/print Human endothelium exposed to human blood",

After 1950 he lived and worked as a professor in the US. In 1990 the American journal \"Life\" listed him as one of the hundred most important people of the twentieth century. In 2004 Kolff received similar acclaim in the Netherlands: he finished in 47 th place in public elections for De Grootste Nederlander (the greatest Dutch man/ woman), a list of the hundred most important people in the country's history.

As I (JT) mentioned previously, in mid-1997 my sister suffered acute renal failure in both kidneys when she was just 50. This was followed by a long and miserable period, in which her close family repeatedly feared for her life. After more than a year, her condition stabilised and she had to undergo dialysis five times a day at equal intervals. Apart from all the other complaints, this was hardly an appealing state to be in. So the thought of a transplant wasn't far from our thoughts. In the first instance, the specialists thoroughly investigated the possibility of using a family member as a donor. My brother seemed to be the best \"match\" for my sister; in fact, the perfect match. Without thinking twice he donated one of his kidneys to my sister. By the beginning of 1999 it was a 'fait accompli'. The transplant had proceeded successfully and for more than ten years now my sister has been able to lead a relatively normal life with minimum use of medication; all because of a perfect match! It all makes you think differently about the alternatives. Not everyone who's on a donor waiting list is fortunate enough to have such a brother!",
