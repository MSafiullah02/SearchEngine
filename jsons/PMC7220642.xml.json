The frequency with which the ventilator cycles between these two pressures in 1 min defines the respiratory rate (RR). This multiplied by the volume generated each cycle gives the minute volume (MV).",

The PEEP therefore provides the same function as bottle height by preventing alveolar collapse. In ARDS the lungs stiffen increasing alveolar collapse and ventilation/perfusion mismatch. Think of these patients like our own challenging (collapsible) patients, the hypermetropic eyes with a narrow anterior chamber. Unfortunately, cohesive viscoelastic is not an option in the lung so to keep the alveoli open in the setting of ARDS, the PEEP is increased, often to >10 cmH2O, to promote alveolar recruitment and to improve oxygenation [2].",

In the ventilation of patients with ARDS, gravity will cause the localised collapse of posterior segments of the lung whilst simultaneously shunting blood to these poor oxygenated portions of the lung, increasing V/Q mismatch. Placing patients in the prone position is a technique to counter gravity dependant collapse/atelectasis and as for post macular hole surgery patients, longer is better and 16+ hours is advised [3].",

In the context of COVID-19 related lung disease, pressure control may be preferable because the operator is able to limit barotrauma by setting a ceiling pressure on the ventilator. Lung damage is reduced at the expense of lower tidal volumes, MV and therefore reduced CO2 clearance. Conversely, to increase CO2 clearance, either the RR or Vt must be increased, however the ARDS.net study showed that smaller tidal volumes, 6\u20138 ml/kg IBW, improve outcomes despite a higher CO2 [4].",
