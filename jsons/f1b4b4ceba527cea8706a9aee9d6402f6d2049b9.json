Save for the critically ill, the vast majority of patients with viral pneumonia will not require any IR procedure (28 IR procedures in 27 patients out of the cohort of 206 during SARS-CoV epidemic) (4) . For the purpose of procedure planning and gearing, the procedure mix could be broadly divided into respiratory disease and critical care related (majority: e.g., peripheral/central lines, chest drains for effusions, caval filters), and related to underlying patient's comorbidity (minority: e.g., biliary drainage, dialysis catheters) (4). The main approach is to perform the procedures outside of the main radiology department as much as possible. We have a decentralized angiography suite with a angiography c-arm and a dedicated ultrasound machine, housed within NCID with negative pressure in a double door isolation room configuration. \"Portable whenever possible\" is also a valid approach in the absence of a decentralized suite or due to inability to transport unstable patients. This, however, is largely limited to ultrasound guided bedside procedures (e.g., peripheral lines and thoracocentesis).",

Similarly during the SARS-CoV epidemic in Singapore, among the 206 cases, there were 84 healthcare workers infection resulting in 5 deaths. A known mechanism in hospital-associated transmission is through undiagnosed cases, where the healthcare workers were not adequately protected during unsuspected patient exposure. This is https://doi.org/10.3348/kjr.2020.0163 kjronline.org particularly a challenge with non-specific symptomatology (e.g., cough, diarrhea) and overlap clinical syndromes of the viral infection with other common diseases (e.g., acute pulmonary oedema vs. adult respiratory distress syndrome, bacterial pneumonia vs. viral pneumonia). One of the authors was quarantined after developing fever, on retrospective diagnosis of a SARS-CoV patient which he had previously performed thoracentesis. To this end, efficacious case identification and patient screening processes are pivotal in preventing this mode of spread. The department may also opt to broadly apply personal protective equipment (PPE) policy (N95 and eye protection) during the period of the outbreak, even in non-suspect cases to mitigate of staff infection from undiagnosed cases. It is important to note that during the SARS-CoV epidemic, the healthcare workers infection within our institution came to an abrupt halt with introduction of PPE against respiratory droplet infection, and exposure to other body fluids (detailed below), a testament to the efficacy of these protective measures when utilized correctly (4) .",

Besides gown and gloves, other pertinent component includes 1) protective eyewear to protect eye mucosa (goggles or disposable face shield that covers the front and sides of the face) and 2) respiratory protection (two types: N95 filtering facepiece respirator and powered air purifying respirator [PAPR]). Disposable N95 mask is sufficient for the majority of IR procedures, while the PAPR is reserved for procedures which are \"cough/gag inducing\" which increases the aerosolization load (e.g., endotracheal intubation) (5) . IR units are best to discuss the use of appropriate use of PAPR with their respective infection control unit, in the context of IR procedures. For instance, use of PAPR should be considered during gastrointestinal procedures (e.g., feed tube insertion and upper tract stenting) or during bronchial artery embolization for hemoptysis (4) .",
