From July 2006 through September 2007, we conducted a casecontrol study to explore gastroenteritis-associated viral agents in hospitalized children with diarrhea and in healthy children in Lanzhou, China. Stools from 397 hospitalized children with diarrhea and from 115 asymptomatic control subjects were collected. All of the children were <5 years of age, and their parents were interviewed to determine the symptoms. Consecutive cases were collected from among children who were hospitalized for gastroenteritis in the Department of Pediatrics, The First Hospital of Lanzhou University (Lanzhou, China). Diarrhea was defined as \u2a7e3 loose stools in the previous 24\u201372 h [20]. Patients were excluded from the study if insufficient stool samples were available for a complete evaluation of viral agents, their stools had clear blood streaks, or they had another diagnosed illness, such as pneumonia. Control subjects were asymptomatic children who visited the First Hospital of Lanzhou University Pediatric Primary Care Center for a routine examination and did not have fever, diarrhea, vomiting, or a respiratory illness in the previous 3-week period [21]. All of the control subjects in this study were selected by the frequencymatching method. Control subjects received follow-up by telephone, and the children who had had the above-mentioned clinical symptoms during the week after the initial examination were excluded.",

In addition, the mean duration and frequency of diarrhea did not differ statistically significantly (P = .52 and P = .42, respectively, by Student's t test). Because the seasonal and age distributions of HBoV were similar to those of rotavirus and because there was often coinfection with HBoV and rotavirus, we compared the clinical symptoms between the group of children infected with rotavirus alone and the group of children coinfected with rotavirus and HBoV, and we did not find a statistically significant difference between these 2 groups (all P> .05, by \u03c72 test and Student's t test) (table 4).

Some studies raised the question about whether HBoV is a cause of human gastroenteritis [16, 35]. HBoV is thought to be swallowed during a respiratory tract infection and subsequently excreted in the feces, without further replication in the gastrointestinal tract [35]. Recently, HBoV was found to occur frequently in stool samples from children with gastroenteritis. Vicente et al. [18] found that 48 (9.1%) of 527 stool samples from Spanish patients with gastroenteritis were positive for HBoV. Lau et al. [17] detected HBoV in 2.1% of fecal samples from children with gastroenteritis in Hong Kong, and some of these patients had respiratory tract symptoms. These studies implicatedHBoV as a gastroenteritis-associated enteric virus. However, the concurrent detection of HBoV and other enteric viruses, which is unusual for known pathogens, raises concern over a causative role of HBoV in human gastroenteritis. Therefore, additional evidence is required to establish a link between HBoV and gastroenteritis.",
