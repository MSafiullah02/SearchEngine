            "text": "With approximately 50\u2013100 million cases annually, dengue is one of the most prevalent mosquito-borne diseases in the world (World Health Organization 2012). Over 40% of the world\u2019s population live in areas with high risk of dengue transmission and over 100 countries are endemic for the disease (Kumar et al. 2010). Dengue is transmitted to humans mainly through the bite of infected female Aedes aegypti mosquitoes and is caused by one or more viral serotypes of the Flaviviridae family [DENV-1 through 4 are known to infect humans; identification of a fifth, sylvatic serotype termed DENV-5 has been claimed (Mustafa et al. 2015)]. Although this illness is typically self-limiting, with infection by one serotype resulting in lifelong immunity to that specific serotype, severe forms of the disease can cause dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome (Kumar et al. 2010). Currently, no treatment exists for dengue and only one controversial vaccine (\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$\\hbox {Dengvaxia}^{\\tiny {\\textregistered }}$$\\end{document}Dengvaxia\u00ae) has been licenced.

Zika was first discovered in Uganda in 1947 and has since spread across the globe, with outbreaks in Yap Island (2007), French Polynesia (2013), and more recently the Americas (2015) (Gao et al. 2016). The Zika virus (ZIKV) is of the same family as the dengue serotypes and is also transmitted to humans primarily by A. aegypti mosquitoes (although it can also be sexually and vertically transmitted within the human population). While some clinical symptoms of Zika, such as acute fever, nausea, rash, joint pain, and myalgia, are similar to dengue, Zika is unique in that it can cause serious complications in the form of Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome and congenital Zika syndrome (Gao et al. 2016).",

However, because of the rapid introduction of Zika into countries that are endemic with dengue, similarities in symptoms between the two diseases, underreporting, and the lack of proper serotesting in developing countries, it is believed that the prevalence of coinfections is higher than currently perceived (R\u00fcckert et al. 2017).",

Researchers in Chaves et al. (2018) reveal that for dengue and Zika specifically, coinfection can impact mosquito infectivity. The results of Chaves et al. (2018) indicate that while the number of dengue virus cDNA copies in coinfected mosquitoes is higher than in monoinfected mosquitoes (up to 12 times higher), Zika cDNA copies are lower in coinfected mosquitoes than in their monoinfected counterparts (6\u20139 times lower). This suggests that coinfection may cause mosquitoes to be more likely to transmit dengue and less likely to transmit Zika.",

            "text": "Within humans, dengue and Zika can display complex viral interactions in the form of antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). ADE occurs when antibodies from a previous infection bind to a pathogen in a subsequent infection and, instead of neutralizing the pathogen, increase viral uptake and replication (Whitehead et al. 2007). Many in vitro studies (e.g., Charles and Christofferson 2016; Dejnirattisai et al. 2016; Durbin 2016; Paul et al. 2016) have shown that dengue antibodies cross-react with the ZIKV, increasing Zika infection of cells and production of viral progeny by over 100-fold. The reciprocal effect of ZIKV antibodies increasing dengue virus titers has also been reported (Kawiecki and Christofferson 2016; Stettler et al. 2016). Although these cross-reactive ADE effects have not been confirmed in vivo in humans by field data, they have been observed in vivo in mice (Bardina et al. 2017) and macaques (George et al. 2017). Thus, given the well-known ADE across DENV serotypes and the consistent in vitro results, the potential is clear for immunity to one of the two viruses to enhance transmission of the other virus within the human population.",

The first two studies to do so also included chikungunya, an arbovirus transmitted by the infamous A. aegypti (Isea and Lonngren 2016; Okuneye et al. 2017), but largely excluded the possibility of coinfection. Isea and Lonngren (2016) focused on analyzing the stability of a nontrivial equilibrium in a system which considers only single transmission of the three viruses. They also introduce a second model that incorporates coinfections within the human population, but its analysis was limited to finding a nontrivial equilibrium. Both models exclude sexual transmission of Zika between humans, coinfection within the mosquito population, and altered infectivity of humans (due to possible ADE) or mosquitoes (due to coinfection). Meanwhile, the model in Okuneye et al. (2017) investigates the impact of a dengue\u2013chikungunya\u2013Zika superinfection hierarchy within humans, where (based on relative incidence data) infection with dengue completely replaces infection with chikungunya or Zika, and infection with chikungunya replaces Zika. Furthermore, the authors include sexual transmission of Zika, assume that dengue vaccination can reduce Zika susceptibility, and consider the possibility of ADE of dengue over Zika (but not ADE of Zika over dengue) by altering the susceptibility of hosts and vectors to Zika, rather than altering Zika infectivity of these populations. Okuneye et al. (2017) found that under this superinfection hierarchy, dengue-induced ADE and dengue vaccination had only minor impacts on Zika transmission.",

The model captures vaccination indirectly through initial conditions. Every combination of susceptible and infectious populations is given a different infection rate, so in principle the model could accommodate both ADE in humans and altered infectivity of coinfected vectors, but qualitative analysis was limited to computation of the basic reproductive number (the number of secondary infections that a single infected individual can make in a completely susceptible population), and numerical analysis set all the infection rates equal to each other (without units) except the rate at which coinfected mosquitoes infect naive humans (with either virus) and the rate at which Zika-monoinfected mosquitoes infect dengue-recovered humans. Comparison of two graphs verified that when these latter two rates were increased by a factor of 3.6, Zika incidence increased. The study\u2019s main conclusion was that a high mosquito birth rate together with dengue vaccination could increase Zika incidence and cause a Zika outbreak to occur earlier and have a higher peak than observed with low mosquito birth rates.",

In this article, we develop the first Zika and dengue transmission model that includes coinfection (in humans and mosquitoes), altered vector infectivity, and ADE for both viruses (i.e., viral enhancement of Zika given dengue antibodies and enhancement of dengue given Zika antibodies). The goal of the present study is to better understand the epidemiological consequences of the dengue\u2013Zika interplay. In particular, through a deterministic mathematical model that utilizes a system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations, we seek to answer the following research questions: How does the endemic presence of dengue affect Zika\u2019s ability to spread in a region?How does invasion of Zika affect the endemic presence of dengue?With Zika rapidly spreading across the globe to regions endemic with dengue, examining the complex interactions between the two pathogens is vital to clarifying the public health impact of the cocirculation of both diseases and potentially informing future vaccine development and control strategies.",

Based on this study, the number of dengue virus cDNA copies in coinfected mosquitoes was 1.25\u201312 times higher than in monoinfected mosquitoes, while ZIKV cDNA copies were 6\u20139 times lower in coinfected mosquitoes than monoinfected mosquitoes.

(2017) and Wang and Zhao (2019). However, unlike ours, the BRN expressions derived in these latter two papers include both vaccination and ADE parameters, because those studies assume that ADE alters susceptibility, rather than infectivity, including of vaccinated individuals. For them, ADE alters the viruses\u2019 BRNs to the extent that vaccinated individuals are present in the disease-free state. Since ADE increases the viral load during a second infection, until field studies confirm the nature of its effects during transmission, the question of whether the increased viral load increases susceptibility or subsequent infectivity remains open. We consider an increased viral load throughout the course of an infection to affect primarily infectivity.",
