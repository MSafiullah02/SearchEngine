The H1N1 pandemic, SARS, Ebola epidemic, and Zika pandemic are recent global events of public health concern (Fineberg 2014; Dixon et al. 2014; Fauci and Morens 2016) . In addition, other local crises such as the US opioid epidemic (US Department of Health and Human Services 2017), have reinforced the need to establish bidirectional communications between clinical practices and public health authorities. As a result, organized healthcare has established and adopted protocols to rapidly handle patients and related risks adequately. It is now common in clinical practices to hear the question \"have you travelled abroad recently?\" or \"have you been to places experiencing a public health emergency?\" Furthermore, guidance from public health authorities can be seen posted throughout halls or clinical spaces in practices. These messages and warnings are now also part of electronic health records and patients are questioned and treated accordingly. Public health authorities (federal, state, and local) continue to develop strategies to reach both clinicians and the general public and having the capacity to handle electronic health record data is a high priority for all of them.",

This meeting reviewed several aspects of bioterrorism and the dental profession: the nature of biological pathogens and its oral manifestations, what needed to be communicated, how dentists should participate, etc. Dr. Michael C. Alfano described the difficulties that biological pathogens create for clinicians because \"they are so insidious.\" While discussing the anthrax mailings after September 11th he pointed out that: \"\u2026 early symptoms appeared so they resembled the aches, fever, and malaise of flu so those affected delayed seeking treatment, a delay that has proven fatal in some cases\". Lieutenant Colonel Ross H. Pastel of the US Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Disease (USAMRIID) listed the \"Category A\" pathogens as defined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and those are: smallpox, anthrax, plague, botulinum toxin, tularemia, and viral hemorrhagic fever. He also described an outbreak of smallpox in Yugoslavia in 1972 and the measures that had to be taken to control it. Dr. Michael Glick described the oral manifestations of smallpox showing \"signs 24 h before skin rash. These oral signs include tongue swelling, multiple mucosa vesicles, ulceration, and mucosal hemorrhaging. Oral signs are also evident in inhalation and gastro-intestinal anthrax. In oropharyngeal anthrax the mucosa appears edematous and congested; there may be neck swelling, fever, and sore throat\".",

Such surveillance-knowing what to look for and whom to report to-is critical and applies not only to suspected bioterrorist agents, but to a list of reportable diseases which has grown to include such entities as West Nile virus and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS).\" Dr. Sigurs O. Krolls presented the response at the local level and he \"stressed the importance of communication and the need for redundant systems\", \"to keep all the parties informed\". He also posed the question \"Can dentists recognize signs and systems of contagious diseases?\", and emphasized that education is essential. Dr. Louis DePaola made several recommendations that can be key in the scope of this paper by saying \"dentists can contribute to bioterrorism surveillance by being alert to clues that might indicate a bioterrorism attack. Such surveillance would note if there is an influx of people seeking medical attention with non-traumatic conditions and flu-like or possibly neurological or paralytic symptoms\u2026 or even specific signs of a bioterrorist agent. Patterns of school or work absence, appointment cancellations or failures to appear, could also be indicators.\" Dr. DePaola made clear that in cases of limited release of bioterrorist agents, dentists \"have little to offer\" but \"a widespread attack can certainly tap into dental professional skills in recognition, isolation and management\". In addition, Dr. Guay (Guay 2002) lists all the possible roles in which dentists can participate including \"education, risk communication, diagnosis, surveillance and notification, treatment, distribution of medications, decontamination, sample collection and forensic dentistry.\"",

He also acknowledges that one of the advantages of this type of documentation is that it \"is much more transportable\". He also recognizes the need for standardized methods for collecting information from dentists. Schleyer and Eisner (1997) defined several scenarios where the COHR is used in a \"shared\" environment where several healthcare providers interact and information is seamlessly communicated, improving the decisions made by clinicians. Delrose and Steinberg (2000) discuss how the \"Digital Patient Record\" enhances clinical practice by providing \"better quality information\" to the clinician. Although all of these benefits sound promising and encouraging some still express concern about the lack of standards among different information systems, which translates into communication breakdowns (Schleyer 2003) . On the other hand, Heid et al. (2002) list all the steps that are currently being taken by different organizations such as the ADA in order to produce a standardized COHR. Other examples of standardization can be found in a paper presented by Narcisi (1996) where ADA's participation as a voting member in the American National Standards Institute has allowed EDI or the COHR to be discussed and improved at a national level, now much commonly known as the Electronic Dental Record or EDR. Additional influences in the standardization of the EDR are the security regulations mandated by HIPAA, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996. Dentists are required to \"adopt practices necessary for compliance\" (Sfikas 2003; Chasteen et al. 2003) . These and other regulations (Szekely et al. 1996) will encourage homogeny among different system vendors. Computer ownership, on the other hand, has increased steadily during the last 25 years. According to Schleyer et al. (2003) in 1976 only 1% of dental professionals used computers in their practices compared to 85% in 2000. Additionally, similar trends in Internet connectivity where described. Acharya et al. (2017) reported that chairside Internet utilization increased to 72% in 2017.",

Such signs and symptoms can be easily detected if the dentist is properly prompted to search for them. This is just one example of how a system could provide assistance in the detection of a bioterrorism incident. But, before describing our proposed approach, it would be important to describe the principles behind biosurveillance systems including those such as syndromic surveillance as well as the technical aspects behind them . As an example, we describe the Realtime Outbreak Disease Surveillance Laboratory (RODS Lab). RODS Lab uses data obtained directly from chief complaints in the emergency departments of hospitals to construct time series and other forms of aggregated data, to characterize the health status of a specific population. These aggregated data are then assessed by detection algorithms, which can issue alerts in case patterns in the data suggest the emergence of a bioterrorism event.",

Among the features that were included in this new clinical management system (CMS), a bioterrorism detection module was added. She felt curious because of recent news she read in the newspaper about possible attacks against the US and decided to install the feature. She read about how the module would work in combination with the CMS she just bought. The educational information provided with the software instructed Dr. X, that in case a patient victim of a bioterrorism attack happens to be seen in her practice, the software would collect information and would send it to public health officials. When installing the software, Dr. X was asked if she agreed to share such information with public health authorities and she approved. During the week, a patient walked into Dr. X's dental office. The patient presented some signs that indicated the presence of a disease of unclear origin. An epidemiologic study later would show that the patient was present at a football stadium when an infectious agent was released (Fig. 12.1) . Although, at that time his medical history showed no indication of a systemic disease, the presence of multiple oral vesicles prompted the dentist to make an annotation into the COHR. The system, by using a natural language processing engine, detected the sign and sent this information to a central database. The patient was discharged and instructed to take some support medication to treat the oral ulcers. The next day, the central database pinpointed the presence of an out of the ordinary increase in the number of cases with the same signs and symptoms around that region. When the presence of this peak was detected, the central server sent a request to the dentist's computer for additional information. One of the requested elements was if there was any use of medication for treating oral ulcers. Fortunately, this information was available. The central database crossed this with the information of other surveillance systems together with the information from other patients that happened to have similar clinical signs and/or symptoms. Dr. X received an email from a public health official asking her to communicate to the local health department to discuss information about one her patients.",

In our use case we described the use of several sources of information for detecting a bioterrorist attack. We described how syndromic information, which initially should be de-identified, is transmitted to a central database. Later, after the suspicion of a bioterrorist attack, more information is requested (medications) and more inferences are made. This, although technically possible, would require allowing for sharing clinical information with public health authorities. This leads to the discussion about \"individual rights\" vs. \"common good\". Although HIPAA addresses public health (Gesteland et al. 2003; Lumpkin 2001) , some other implications may arise and the health professionals including dentists, physicians, and public health officials, and patients should discuss and address such issues.
