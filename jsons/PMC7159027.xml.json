This tenet is well supported by the current problems being presented by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) on several continents [1, 2], even more so as SARS is a viral infection whose genetic identity has only recently been reported [3, 4]. Inspection of the SARS genome using a battery of bioinformatic techniques suggests some of the gene products that might be targeted as a site of intervention, albeit the majority of the genome escapes functional assignment [3, 4]. The purpose of this note is to introduce the use of an automated structural proteomic pipeline to extend the assignment of putative function for the gene products of SARS, and in so doing offer several new targets for further assessment. Key to this approach is the development of robust functional assignments achieved by relying on multiple methods of analysis that are highly integrated.",

When taken with the third long coding region for the S (Spike) protein, these three sequences are likely to be a fertile source or targets through which a therapeutic might be developed. While this study considered all of the open reading frames (orfs) within the genome, all hypotheses developed are isolated to these first three regions of the genome. Our strategy has been to employ the validated methods of protein function assignment embodied by the DS GeneAtlas\u2122 pipeline, consisting of a cacophony of methods from both bioinformatic and structural biology fields, all of which is described elsewhere [5]. Such an automated approach is only enabled through the comprehensive integration of the respective methods, leveraging the strengths and weaknesses of each to develop robust assignments.",

Analysis of the variation of the different strains was performed to ensure that all non\u2010synonymous polymorphisms were consistent with the assignments being proposed. Moreover, using predicted protein sequences from different strains and protein products based on putative cleavage sites has shown that the functional assignments discussed herein are robust and invariant to the specific protein sequences used as input to the DS GeneAtlas pipeline. In many cases the assignments of all resulting protein sequences contained inferences to structural homologies, albeit via sequence homologies that are below 30%. The robustness of such assignments follows from cooperating evidence obtained from protein threading and more traditional bioinformatics techniques, but also is afforded the automated and manual inspection of the structural alignment with respect to known active site residues, preservation of binding site residues, defined secondary structure, and conserved residues known to be involved in the function of the protein.",

The pipeline consists of transmembrane domain prediction using TransMem [6], domain prediction using HMMer and Pfam, sequence similarity search using PSI\u2010BLAST, fold recognition using SeqFold [7], and homology modeling using MODELER [8]. The confidence of the annotations is often judged based on the consensus of several methods. For structural annotation, \u2018Consensus Score\u2019 is used to rank the confidence of the annotation. \u2018Consensus Score\u2019 is defined as \u2018Model Score\u2019 plus the sum of the active site percentage identity minus a threshold factor of 0.2 where the sum is over all the reported active site records in template PDB file. If there is no active site record in template, \u2018Consensus Score\u2019 is the same as \u2018Model Score\u2019. The confidence is high if \u2018Consensus Score\u2019 is greater than 1.0, the confidence is medium if the \u2018Consensus Score\u2019 is between 0.0 and 1.0, and the confidence is low if \u2018Consensus Score\u2019 is less than 0.0. For Pfam (http://www.sanger.ac.uk/software/pfam/) annotations, if the e\u2010value is less than 1e\u22125 the confidence is high; if e\u2010value is between 0.1 and 1e\u22125 and the bit score is better than the noise cutoff [9], the confidence is medium; otherwise, the confidence is low.",

Although Mpro and 3Cpro have very low sequence similarity (less than 10% sequence identity), given the common fold, their ligand binding pockets are located at the same position in the cleft between the two \u03b2 domains (Fig. 2\n) and may bind to a similar ligand.

The TGEV Mpro structure of the apo protein and the ligand bound protein are similar with backbone rmsd less than 1.0 \u00c5 without major conformational changes around the ligand binding site. The percentage sequence identity between SARS Mpro and TGEV Mpro is 44% and is 41% between SARS and HCoV Mpro. Therefore, the original template that we used is still one of the best templates for creating the homology model of SARS Mpro. Subsequently, the crystal structure of the Mpro of SARS genome was determined and deposited into the PDB databank (1q2w). The backbone rmsd between our predicted model and the X\u2010ray structure is 2.45 \u00c5 over 295 residues. The structure is more conserved around the ligand binding site, the backbone atom rmsd is 1.32 \u00c5 over 220 residues.",

The polymerase and helicase domains are predicted by others based on sequence analysis methods [3, 4], however, these are the first model structures created using homology modeling. Although the model scores are poor, the assignment is confirmed by Pfam analysis used in GeneAtlas pipeline. It should be noted that the predicted structure of the large insertion region for about 40 residues (colored with yellow background in Fig. 3A\nand blue in Fig. 3B) is tenuous. Homology models created automatically by the DS GeneAtlas pipeline are mainly used to confirm the low scoring regions in matches found by PSI\u2010BLAST or SeqFold searches and to reduce false positives inherent in these methods [5]. Model regions with high sequence identity to a template with small insertions are generally more reliable than model regions with large insertions. Model regions with conserved functional motifs such as active sites or ligand binding sites are in general more reliably assigned than assignments absent these features. This is demonstrated by the model of Mpro where the ligand binding site has a low rmsd with the X\u2010ray structure. These experiences support the conclusion that homology models created via an automated pipeline can provide useful insights on the fold of the protein, the mapped active sites and functional motifs from the template, and the location(s) of putative binding pockets. For subsequent structure\u2010based studies such as ligand docking the models should be used with some caution as they often require further manual refinement to improve the sequence alignment and to regenerate an improved model.",

The model created based on the 1gx5 template is the longest model with most complete structure and the catalytic triad Asp220, Asp318, Asp319 in the template is conserved in the model\u2010template alignment (Fig. 3A). A crystal structure of the HCV polymerase has two ligand binding sites, one in the catalytic reaction center and one on the surface of the protein (Fig. 3B) about 30 \u00c5 from the catalytic center. For HCV, there is no need for a primer for the RNA replication and the riboguanosine triphosphate (rGTP) binding to the surface pocket is believed to be the initiation step of the RNA replication [16]. The residues in the surface binding site are not conserved between template and model which suggests that the SARS virus replication is likely to be activated by other means or by a different type of ligand. The structures are more conserved around the catalytic reaction center and there are no large gaps between model sequence and template sequence. On the other hand, several parts of the model structure on the surface are modeled with lower quality due to a few large insertions in the model sequence. Another model structure is created based on template 1c2p albeit more than 100 residues in the N\u2010terminus are not modeled by this template. Notwithstanding, the model has a slightly better model score (0.18), and the sequence deletion is on the surface of the protein. For ligand docking to the catalytic center, this second model is likely to be a better structure to use for this protein target.",

The alignment used to create the homology model is generated by PSI\u2010BLAST which can yield slightly different profiles depending if a sequence is used as input or a domain of that sequence is used as input. The difference is only significant when the homology between template and model is extremely low. In the case of the main protease model, the cleaved sequence and the complete sequence resulted in exactly the same model.",

They are close homologs to the SARS coronavirus Mpro. The model structure of the Mpro based on TGEV has good quality and can be used in the de novo inhibitor design. The RNA polymerase of SARS virus exhibits remote homology to HCV polymerase which is an important drug target for treating hepatitis C infection. Also predicted are several other novel structural or functional domains that are not currently known, such as the Fts\u2010J\u2010like methyltransferase and the fusion peptide.

This is consistent with our assignment of Fts\u2010J\u2010like methyltransferase to a domain in pp1b. Meta servers such as the 3D\u2010Jury system [19] are based on the consensus score of many fold recognition programs and have been shown to be quite effective at the identification of correct folds for unknown proteins. However, fold recognition programs are often time consuming and the meta servers are not typically designed for high\u2010throughput (whole genome) analysis as described herein. Moreover, DS GeneAtlas annotates non\u2010structural regions of the available sequence with transmembrane domain predictions, and structural annotations that are important for protein function are automatically identified and mapped onto the model structures, for example, active site annotations from a template protein. While existing meta servers [19, 20, 21] focus on the use of structural modeling to annotate individual novel proteins, the present study combines protein modeling with mutation analysis and membrane spanning region prediction to provide a comprehensive functional view of the SARS genome in which assignments are correlated across a variety of analysis methods.",
