Veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) provides an efficient rewarming method with complete cardiopulmonary support. The use of VA-ECMO for this indication has greatly improved the vital and functional prognosis of patients. Case presentation: We report a case of a 46-year-old patient who was treated for severe hypothermia with a temperature of 22.4\u00b0C along with initial cardiac arrest, whose progression was favorable after the implementation of VA-ECMO support. Two months after initial cardiac arrest, the patient was reassessed and showed signs of complete recovery with regard to his mental and physical capacities. Conclusions: The recent international publications and groups of experts recommend the use of VA ECMO as the gold standard therapy to treat severe hypothermia. Therefore, it seems suitable to update the current knowledge on the topic by analysing the latest international publications. The performance of this technique calls into question ethical and economic factors. Two distinct medical teams tried to identify and regroup prognosis factors in predictive survival scores. They raise the question of the utility of these scores in clinical practice. Indeed, according to which survival rate should we proceed to prolonged resuscitation and implement VA-ECMO? Additional studies will be needed for external approval of these survival scores, and additional reflection by experts will be required.",

In these cases, ECLS, which replaces the function of the heart by a pump and the function of the lungs by an oxygenation membrane, with a control of the temperature of the circuit, is the only recommended device to provide active internal warming [1, 2] . Without any active internal warming, active external warming techniques are not used due to the risks associated with low cardiac output caused by peripheral vasodilatation. When ECLS is not available, other active internal warming techniques should be considered, such as peritoneal lavage, intravascular warming catheter and renal replacement therapy (intermittent or continuous) [2, 3] .",

            "text": "Among the available ECLS devices, central or peripheral cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) was the first replacement technique used in the early 1980s, with several conclusive publications on the topic. In particular, Althaus et al. reported full recovery of 3 patients after hypothermic cardio-respiratory arrest. One of the patients underwent active central warming by a central shunt, whereas the other two patients had a peripheral shunt with a femoro-femoral approach [8] . Since the early 2000s VA-ECMO has been the gold standard therapy for this indication [6, 7] . Compared to central cardio-pulmonary shunt, VA-ECMO remains a faster and easier supportive treatment to implement. Moreover, it requires less anticoagulation to function and has the ability to be maintained in place for effective support in the event of persistent cardiac instability or severe pulmonary oedema after rewarming. Ruttmann et al. demonstrated this use in a retrospective series of 59 patients with severe hypothermia with cardio-circulatory arrest at admission. Despite a high mortality rate of approximately 79% in this cohort, this high rate could be explained by failure to recover spontaneous cardiac activity during extracorporeal warming in 26 patients. The authors showed an increased in mortality in the group of patients rewarmed by the cardiopulmonary shunt without VA-ECMO. Thus, in the 33 patients with ROSC, the survival rate with a good neurological outcome was approximately 56% in patients with VA-ECMO, compared to 18% in patients with extracorporeal circulation (ECC). Moreover, the authors reported 9 deaths from massive pulmonary oedema in the ECC group, while there were no deaths in the VA-ECMO group. This study shows an increased mortality rate in the ECC group supported by the multivariate analysis. Indeed, VA-ECMO support was demonstrated as an independent risk factor of survival with an odds ratio (OR) of 6,6. The mechanisms underlying this increase in mortality rate can be explained by the occurrence of severe diastolic dysfunction of the left ventricle during rewarming and by ischemia-reperfusion injury. VA-ECMO, by giving the opportunity to provide prolonged hemodynamic support, could prevent this acute failure [9] . The results of this study and the others discussed below are presented in Table 2 . This post-rewarming heart failure was found in various studies with different results. In experimental studies on canine or pig models, residual left systolic ventricular dysfunction was demonstrated [14, 15] . However, in a more recent prospective work conducted on a small sample of 9 patients in which VA-ECMO was implemented for HT III or IV, the researchers discovered moderate biventricular diastolic dysfunction but no systolic impairment after the rewarming process [16] .",

Above all, there is a trend of an improved survival rate when VA-ECMO is the implemented ECLS mechanism [9, 19] . In a recent literature review on ECLS and HT IV patients, researchers found a global survival rate of 73%, with 89% of these patients showing a promising neurological recovery i.e., Cerebral Performance Category (CPC) 1 or 2 [20] . In this group, the researchers decided to only consider bystander-witnessed cardiac arrest patients, especially during the initial mobilization. This made it possible to eliminate patients already in cardiac arrest at the initial management, and for whom it is difficult to know whether the cardiac arrest is induced by the profound hypothermia or due to a hypoxic cause, which makes the global prognosis poorer. Despite the retrospectivity bias, this analysis demonstrates the good outcome of early management of profound hypothermia by ECLS, even in the case of early-stage cardiac arrest. These high survival rates with good neurological outcomes, even in the case of prolonged resuscitation, are thanks to the massive decrease in cerebral metabolism during deep hypothermia. The cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen is reduced by 6% for each 1\u00b0C decrease in core body temperature. This allows the brain cells to tolerate circulatory arrests 10-times longer than usual [21] .",

Based on a retrospective analysis of 286 patients in 18 publications, Pasquier et al. developed the HOPE score, which takes into account six clinico-biological variables who are age, gender, asphyxia associated, CPR duration, serum potassium level and temperature (score calculation and predicted survival use an algorithm which is available online at: www.hypothermiascore.org). The statistical analysis showed that the area under the ROC curve for the HOPE score is more useful than kalaemia for predicting survival [12] . Saczkowski et al. published an another review screening 658 patients from 40 clinical cases and 44 retrospective cohorts. The survival rate was approximately 46%, with a good neurological outcome rate of 87,5% among the survivors (CPC 1 or 2). Three independent risk factors were identified in these cohorts: the initial hyperkalaemia and previous asphyxia before cardiac arrest were related to poor prognosis, whereas female sex was related to better prognosis. On the basis of these three variables, they defined the ICE score to determinate a survival with good neurological prognosis, which ranges from 85 to 0% in this model. Correlated to an area under the ROC curve of 0,849 [13] . Components of these two scores are presented in Table 4 . Limiting factors for HOPE and ICE scores exist, as there has not yet been external validation, and potential publication bias is possible.",

However, the lactate level was high, and the pH was below 7, which did not prevent good clinical and neurological outcomes. HOPE and ICE scores were not available when we managed our patient but if we calculated them, the HOPE score resulted in 59% survival, and the ICE score was 0 (0 point for male sex, 0 point for no associated asphyxia and 0 point for the initial serum potassium concentration less than 5 mmol/l), corresponding to a probability of survival with a good neurological outcome of 60% [12, 13] . These results, similar for the two predictive scores, raise the question of their usefulness in clinical practice. Indeed, is there any existing survival score that can help us predict when to proceed to a prolonged resuscitation and implement VA-ECMO? The dilemma is then to counterbalance the predicted low survival rate against the cost of VA-ECMO implementation, and therefore, assess life-limit on a strictly economic basis. On the other hand, is there still an indication to implement such an expensive technique even if predictive scores show low survival rates under 60 or 70%? These questions raise moral and economic questions and will require a reflection process, but first we need studies to approve these survival scores, and also to confirm the place of VA-ECMO in deep hypothermia. The development of new ECMO circuits that are easy to install and start will also be important in the years to come in order to make this technique more accessible and less expensive. Nevertheless, patients, after that ECMO is implanted, should be managed by an ICU expert team of a referral hospital [25] .",
