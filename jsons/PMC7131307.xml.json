The use of cadaveric skin allografts as temporary biological coverage for transplantation on massive thermal injury is practised in many major Burn Centres. Its relative low cost and availability permits early complete excision of the burn wound which has been shown to reduce mortality, length of hospital stay and even blood loss [1], [2], [3], [4], [5]. The secondary objective of the skin bank is to have an available source of skin allografts for research purposes.",

The onset of SARS also affected donor numbers as stricter criteria were then implemented for donor suitability (Table 1). Other factors for poor yield are mainly due to social and cultural reasons which include religious conviction and Asian superstitions.",
