One such tactic is to divert the host immune response with a decoy. Decoy epitopes have been reported in a wide variety of viruses, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) [2], feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) [3], hepatitis C [4], foot and mouth disease [5], middle-east respiratory syndrome coronavirus [6], severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus [7], porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) [8], murine gammaherpesvirus-68 (MHV-68) [9], and porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) [10]. Because a recombinant mutant capsid protein (CP) with a deleted decoy epitope induced a higher level of virus-neutralizing antibody than wild type proteins [11], it was expected that higher levels of decoy epitope in a prepared batch of subunit vaccine would decrease its efficacy. However, it was not possible to test this hypothesis by measuring levels of decoy epitope in a vaccine because an antibody specific to the decoy epitope was not readily available.",

The only structural protein of this virus is a 28-kD CP, which includes major antigenic determinants that can be used in subunit vaccines [13]. A previous study showed that an epitope composed of amino acid residues 169\u2013180 (CP169\u2013180) is the most immunodominant among these antigenic determinants [11]. Because this epitope is buried inside the virus-like particle (VLP) structure (Fig. 1\nA), antibodies to this epitope cannot react with the intact virus, and therefore are non-neutralizing [14]. As expected, PCV infection elicited a humoral response to the CP169\u2013180 epitope and drove the production of non-neutralizing antibodies [15]. Therefore, previous infection with PCV decreased the vaccines prevention of the future infections.",

To rectify this, we generated a monoclonal antibody specific to the immunodominant CP169\u2013180 epitope from an antibody library generated using chickens immunized with CP169\u2013180 peptide. This recombinant anti-CP169\u2013180 antibody preferentially reacted to delN CP with an exposed CP169\u2013180 epitope compared to VLP in an enzyme immunoassay (Fig. 1B). Because the length of linear B-cell epitopes can vary widely from 3 to 38 amino acids [37], we confirmed that CP169\u2013180 peptides behave as a single epitope in a competition enzyme immunoassay. The recombinant CP169\u2013180 antibody almost completely inhibited the binding of PCV2-infected pig sera to CP169\u2013180 peptide.",
