Chlamydia psittaci is responsible for less than 5% of community-acquired pneumonia [3, 4]. Several outbreaks of C. psittaci infections in humans have occurred in different countries over the past 20 years, with a case fatality rate of less than 1% [5, 6]. Chlamydia psittaci enters the body mainly through the respiratory tract by inhaling aerosolised bacteria when exposed to infected secretions, droppings, or feathers [6]. Chlamydia psittaci occurs not only in Psittacinae and pigeons but also in poultry. Poultry, including chickens and ducks, are the most important sources of infection in China. One study found that the prevalence of C. psittaci in poultry sold in markets was 13% in chickens, 39% in ducks, and 31% in pigeons [7].",

The flu-like atypical pneumonia symptoms and an exposure history to birds are the primary criteria for clinical diagnosis. Laboratory diagnosis requires meeting any one of three criteria: (1) isolation of Chlamydia psittaci from respiratory secretions; (2) a fourfold or greater increase in antibody titre between serum samples collected 2 weeks apart, using a complement-fixation test (CFT) or micro-immunofluorescence (MIF); and (3) IgM antibody against C. psittaci titre detected by MIF of 1:16 or higher [5]. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a faster and more specific diagnostic test, available in specialised diagnostic laboratories [8]. Because of its non-specific symptoms and the limitations of current tests, psittacosis is easily underdiagnosed and misdiagnosed [9].",

Sequencing were performed at BGISEQ-100 platform (Beijing Genomics Institute, Wuhan, China). 3. The remaining nonhuman sequences were read after subtraction of the human host sequences mapped to the human reference genome (hg19) using Burrows\u2013Wheeler Alignment and the low-quality reads and short reads (length < 35 bp) were removed. The remaining data were aligned to the four Microbial Genome Databases, consisting of bacteria, virus, fungi, and parasites. The mapped data were processed for advanced data analysis. Lists of suspected pathogenic microorganisms were produced, which included the numbers of strictly mapped reads, coverage rate, and depth. The clinical diagnosis was determined by considering all the clinical manifestations, possible pathogens identified by mNGS and other laboratory tests together.",

After admission to our hospital, patients underwent bronchofibroscopy, and alveolar lavage fluid was collected for mNGS. Six of the patients developed septic shock, and their blood and alveolar lavage fluid samples were sent for mNGS simultaneously (Fig. 3). The typical bronchofibroscopy findings were hyperaemic tracheal mucosa with oedema, a moderate amount of thin white or yellow secretions in the segmental bronchi, and occasional small patches of scattered haemorrhage.",

Our nine cases of severe psittacosis pneumonia, diagnosed with the aid of mNGS, and had characteristics and clinical features that differed from previously reported cases [7, 9]. Previous reports on psittacosis have included chills, white phlegm, cough, generalised myalgia, and weakness as general symptoms, and most reported cases have been of mild-to-middle severity [1, 2]. In our nine cases, headache was a prominent feature in seven patients, and five patients had lethargy or a coma, with one patient being suspected to have meningitis initially. Respiratory failure and septic shock developed gradually and necessitated the provision of mechanical ventilation and organ support therapy, which has not been reported previously. The patients\u2019 laboratory data generally showed normal or slightly elevated leucocytes, neutrophils, and PCT, with high CRP levels. Knittler and Sachs [15] reported that C. psittaci is more pathogenic and multiplies more rapidly than other Chlamydiales species, and therefore, C. psittaci causes more severe inflammatory reactions. Inflammatory lesions in CT began in the upper lobe of lung, aggravated to bilateral lobes and air-space consolidation and ground-glass opacity, along with miliary, nodular, or consolidated shadows. Additionally, patients with septic shock and those who require mechanical ventilation are susceptible to secondary infections, which can lead to death, as illustrated by the patient in our study who died because of Klebsiella pneumoniae bacteraemia.",

Minocycline, a second-generation tetracycline, also cures C. psittaci infections, with minimum inhibitory concentrations ranging from 0.03 to 0.06 mg/L and minimum bactericidal concentrations ranging from 0.06 to 0.25 mg/L in vitro [19]. Because of its higher efficacy and the lower incidence of side effects, our patients were treated with minocycline instead of tetracycline or doxycycline. Six of nine patients were started on a cephalosporin antibiotic initially; however, C. psittaci does not respond to cephalosporins, so this may have contributed to the severity of the pneumonia experienced by patients.",
