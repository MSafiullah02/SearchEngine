This virus has some uncommon extrapulmonary symptoms in patients, like anorexia, diarrhea, and vomiting, not necessarily with respiratory symptoms (Pan et al. 2020), leading to its naming of SARS-CoV-2, with the disease being termed COVID-19. It is spread from person to person in the community. However, there is no drug on the market with definite curing effects, so the main strategy is focused on symptomatic support. Some patients showed lower ability to respond to treatment after hospitalization and developed severe pneumonia, pulmonary edema, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), or multiple organ failure (Mo et al. 2020).",

Transmission of the aerosol is also possible in protracted exposure. The pathophysiology of these viruses is that they are enveloped, positive-stranded RNA viruses with nucleocapsids, with an approximate length of 30 kb, making them the largest known RNA viruses. In the host, firstly, the synthesis of polyprotein 1a/1ab (pp1a/pp1ab) takes place from the viral RNA. The clinical variety of COVID-19 varies from asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic forms to respiratory failure to multiorgan and systemic manifestations in terms of sepsis, septic shock, and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). The symptoms in the early stages of infection were non-specific, and differential diagnosis may include a variety of infectious and non-infectious etiologies (Cascella et al. 2020).",

Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) are the most important clinical aminotransferases, and the liver is a rich source. Therefore, following any damage in liver cells, these enzymes fuse into the bloodstream and increase their concentration in serum.

The studies are hospital-based cross-sectional and case series types and were carried out in China. A forest plot and funnel plot were prepared using STATA 16 statistical software to describe individual studies and the pooled mean. Heterogeneity between studies was indicated by the I2 value. I2 statistics of less than 50% were considered as low and indicating a greater degree of similarity between studies. Statistical significance was fixed at a p-value less than 5% because meta-analysis is a type of observational study; errors can occur in the methodology of study inclusion and analysis, resulting in incorrect results.

The high heterogeneity of each variable type observed in the studies was due to the different periods in which the studies were carried out and the diversity of locations, cultures, and economic status. The cause of liver damage in COVID-19 was due to SARS-CoV-2 being similar to SARS-CoV and could invade the human body by binding to the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) receptor, which causes liver tissue injury by upregulation of ACE-2 expression in liver tissue (Pan et al. 2020).",

A study suggests that, as the disease progresses, patients encounter secondary infection, which further causes abnormal liver function, due to (1) viral infection directly causing damage to liver cells and (2) drug-related liver damage (Liu et al. 2020a).",

The alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and albumin pooled means were reported to be within the normal range; however, the serum level of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (pooled mean) was found to be high in COVID-19 patients. Also, it can be concluded from the pooled means that COVID-19 caused small alterations in liver function but not necessarily liver failure itself.",
