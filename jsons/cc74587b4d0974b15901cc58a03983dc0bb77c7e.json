These terms are often erroneously used interchangeably. APCs arise from the systemic arteries and supply the pulmonary circulation. These vessels, in the setting of congenital heart disease (CHD), can cause a significant systemic to pulmonary shunt. 4 They typically arise from the descending aorta, subclavian artery or its branches, bronchial and intercostal arteries. They often supply blood to the terminal respiratory unit and unlike bronchial arteries do not necessarily travel in close proximity to the bronchial tree. 4 They have been known to be associated with lesions associated with decreased pulmonary blood flow (tetralogy of Fallot, pulmonary atresia) 5 but have also been seen in premature neonates with bronchopulmonary dysplasia. [6] [7] [8] [9] They are usually small and regress spontaneously in this latter group rarely needing intervention. 10, 11 APCs are synonymous with broncho-pulmonary arterial anastomoses and there are very few reports of coil embolization of these vessels for pediatric hemoptysis 2 aside from those associated with known CHD. Prominent APCs are more prevalent with cyanotic structural cardiac lesions. 4 Though massive hemoptysis is rare after palliated congenital cardiac lesions, there have been multiple reports of post-Fontan patients who present with massive hemoptysis, resolving after embolization of multiple aorto-pulmonary collateral vessels.

The patients in our series did not have any adverse events related to bronchoscopy or cardiac catheterization.Barnacle 16 also stated that metal coils are rarely appropriate for BAE despite some published recommendations. They occlude large arteries, meaning that recurrent hemoptysis is likely because of revascularization by collaterals. However, in our cohort, we did not have a recurrence of hemoptysis, though they did not have a repeat cardiac catheterization to exclude revascularization.16 It is theoretically possible that coils placed in these APCs would hamper embolization of distal vessels if revascularization did occur.28 Additionally, a significant correlate was that the site of bleeding on bronchoscopy correlated with the site of the APCs on catheterization.All six of the patients were found to have right sided APCs.Bronchoscopic bleeding was observed on the right side in two and on both sides in two. All our patients were <12 months of age and all required escalation of care to the ICU prior to bronchoscopy with most requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation. The natural history of pediatric hemoptysis is unknown, and it is hard to know if the APCs contributed significantly to the hemoptysis. The one patient in our series with hemoptysis who did not have any APCs could possibly have had smaller ones not clearly visible on cardiac catheterization and not amenable to coil embolization. It is also possible that there was a different etiology for the hemoptysis which was undiagnosed on the standard workup. The risks and benefits of general anesthesia, procedural complications and radiation exposure need to be considered prior to cardiac catheterization. Moreover, this is a single center study and our sample size is very small precluding broad generalizations.
