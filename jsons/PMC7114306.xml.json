            "text": "Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) causes an estimated US$ 560 million in losses per year to the swine industry in the USA (Neumann et al., 2005). The clinical manifestations of PRRS includes severe reproductive failure, post-weaning pneumonia, growth reduction, and increased mortality (Keffaber, 1989, Loula, 1991). The causative agent of this disease is PRRSV, an enveloped, single-stranded and positive-sense RNA virus (J.J. Meulenberg et al., 1993). PRRSV is a member of the family Arteriviridae, which includes equine arteritis virus (EAV), lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus (LDV) of mice and simian hemorrhagic fever virus (SHFV). There are two PRRSV genotypes, Europe and North America, which are defined based on antigenic and genetic characteristics (Meng et al., 1995, J.J. Meulenberg et al., 1993). PRRSV was first identified in 1991 in Europe (Wensvoort et al., 1991) and in 1992 in USA (Benfield et al., 1992). PRRSV can replicate in vitro (Bautista et al., 1993) in MA-104, African green monkey kidney cells, and cells derived thereof, such as CL2621, MARC145, and CRL11171 (Benfield et al., 1992, Kim et al., 1993, Meng et al., 1994), and/or porcine alveolar macrophages (PAM), which are the primary target cells in vivo (Yoon et al., 1992).",

Modified live attenuated vaccines (MLV) have been commercially available for years; however, there is evidence of reversion to virulence of at least one of the current vaccine strains following use in pigs (Opriessnig et al., 2002). Therefore, alternative strategies are needed for effective PRRS control. This study explored the inhibition of PRRSV propagation in cell cultures by peptide-conjugated phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers (PPMO) specific for PRRSV sequences.",

            "text": "PMO are structurally similar to single-stranded DNA in that each subunit includes a purine or pyramidine base. In PMO each base is joined to a novel backbone consisting of one morpholine ring and phosphorodiamidate linkage per subunit (Summerton, 1999, Summerton and Weller, 1997). PMO are uncharged, water-soluble, and highly resistant to nuclease degradation (Hudziak et al., 1996). PMO bind to target mRNA by Watson\u2013Crick base pairing and exert an antisense effect by preventing access to critical segments of RNA sequence, such as a translation initiation site, through steric blockade. This is a distinctly different process from the RNase H-dependent mechanism induced by the often-used antisense structural type phosphorothioate DNA (Summerton, 1999). A number of studies have shown that PMO can effectively and specifically block translation of target mRNA in vitro and in vivo via intravenous, intraperitoneal, subcutaneous, transdermal or oral administration (Arora et al., 2002a, Arora et al., 2002b, Brent and Drapeau, 2002, Hudziak et al., 2000, Qin et al., 2000, Stein et al., 2001, Taylor et al., 1996). It has been shown that PMO conjugated to short arginine-rich cell penetrating peptides have a significantly higher efficiency of delivery into cultured cells than do non-conjugated PMO (Moulton et al., 2004, Deas et al., 2005). PPMO were found to be fairly stable in cells and human serum for at least 24 h (Youngblood et al., 2007). Sequence-specific antiviral efficacy of PPMO in cell cultures has been documented against SARS coronavirus (Neumann et al., 2005), EAV (van den Born et al., 2005), flaviviruses (Deas et al., 2005, Kinney et al., 2005), Influenza A virus (Ge et al., 2006), and Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (Zhang et al., 2007). Recently PPMO were also applied in vivo and protected animals from challenge with Ebola Virus (Enterlein et al., 2006), Coxsackievirus B3 (Yuan et al., 2006), and murine coronaviruses (Burrer et al., 2007).",

            "text": "PRRSV has an RNA genome approximately 15-kb in size, which consists of 5\u2032 untranslated region (UTR), nine open reading frames (ORF1a, ORF1b, ORF2a, ORF2b, and ORFs 3 through 7) and 3\u2032 UTR (Meng et al., 1994, J.J. Meulenberg et al., 1993). Two large ORFs, la and lb, together occupy over 11 kb and encode 13 non-structural proteins, which are likely involved in genome replication and transcription (J.J. Meulenberg et al., 1993). The remaining ORFs, 2a through 7 encode six membrane-associated proteins (GP2, E, GP3, GP4, GP5, and M) and nucleocapsid (N) protein (Meulenberg et al., 1995). In PRRSV-infected cells, a set of six or seven nested viral subgenomic RNA is formed (Conzelmann et al., 1993, J.J.M. Meulenberg et al., 1993). All of the subgenomic RNA have an identical 5\u2032-leader sequence derived from the 5\u2032 end of genomic RNA, as well as an identical 3\u2032 terminal sequence preceding poly-(A) tails of variable length. The generation of co-terminal mRNA species is believed to be accomplished through a process known as discontinuous subgenomic mRNA synthesis (Sawicki and Sawicki, 1995, van Marle et al., 1999). The 5\u2032 end of each subgenomic mRNA of North American strains contains a common leader sequence of 190 bases (Nelsen et al., 1999), whereas in Lelystad virus, the prototype strain of the European PRRSV genotype, the leader is 221 bases (J.J. Meulenberg et al., 1993). The 3\u2032 UTR of North American and European PRRSV strains are 150 and 120 bases, respectively, excluding the poly-(A) tail, and is common to all of their subgenomic mRNA. PRRSV subgenomic RNAs are polycistronic in structure, but it is believed that only the first open reading frame (ORF) of each subgenomic RNA is translated into a viral protein (Meng et al., 1996b).",

Considering the lengthy genome and sequence heterogeneity of PRRSV strains, we sought to evaluate PPMO that target other sites of the genome and that have broad reactivity against different strains of PRRSV, and also to further refine our evaluation of efficacy and PPMO mechanism of action, in the hopes of defining a potential strategy for addressing PRRSV with PPMO technology.",

We found that it was possible to obtain a greater-than-additive effect by using a combination of two PPMO.

Parallel sequence alignments of PRRSV strains from each of the two major genotypes show that the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 UTRs, and the translation initiation regions of all ORFs, within each genotype, are highly conserved. These regions likely participate in essential events of the viral life cycle (Tan et al., 2001, Verheije et al., 2002), making them rational sites for antisense PPMO targeting. For this study, 12 PPMO were designed against PRRSV VR2385, a virulent strain of the North American genotype. PPMO sequences and target site locations in the PRRSV genome are specified in Table 1\nand depicted schematically in Fig. 1B. The 5\u2032 terminal region has proven to be a productive PPMO target region in a number of positive-strand RNA viruses (Burrer et al., 2007, Deas et al., 2005, van den Born et al., 2005, Zhang et al., 2006). PPMO 5UP2 and 5HP were designed to basepair to the 5\u2032 end region of PRRSV RNA genome, in an attempt to interfere with translation of viral RNA replicases. 5HP is complementary to the hairpin loop region, which was predicted from secondary structure analysis (41). PPMO complementary to negative-sense EAV RNA inhibited EAV replication in cell culture (van den Born et al., 2005). NSP2 is complementary to the 3\u2032 end of negative-sense PRRSV RNA, and was designed to interfere with the production of positive-sense viral RNA. NSP3 is complementary to negative-sense PRRSV RNA in the transcription regulatory sequence (TRS) region, in an attempt to interfere with synthesis and/or translation of the viral subgenomic RNA. 3UP2 is complementary to the 3\u2032 end of PRRSV RNA genome, in an attempt to interfere with negative-strand RNA synthesis. PPMO 1bP1, 2P1, 3P1, 4P1, 5P1, 6P1, and 7P1 are complementary to the translation initiation regions of ORFs 1b, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7, respectively, to attempt blocking the translation of these ORFs. PPMO 5UP1, which is complementary to nucleotide 3-23 of PRRSV 5\u2019 terminal sequence and was previously shown to be highly effective (Zhang et al., 2006) and CP1 were included as positive and negative controls, respectively.",

In this assay, PPMO binding to its RNA target typically results in inhibition of translation of the downstream luciferase coding sequence. Effects of PPMO treatment on target RNA translation were assessed by measurement of luciferase production. Incremental concentrations of PPMO were added to in vitro translation reactions to determine PPMO inhibitory effect on translation. As shown in Fig. 6\n, 100 nM or higher concentration of 5UP2, 7P1, 5HP, and 6P1 reduced luciferase yield by more than 90%, while CP1 had no or little effect on translation of corresponding RNA.

The results of this assay indicate that the antisense PPMO specifically bound complementary RNA and thereby inhibited the translation of luciferase.",

Sequence alignment (Fig. 7B) showed that the region targeted by these PPMO contains highly conserved sequences. In addition, analysis of PRRSV sequences from the GenBank indicates that the complementary sequence of 5UP2 and 5HP are highly conserved across North American PRRSV strains. Thus, these two antisense PPMO may be suitable for application against most North American PRRSV strains. The broad inhibition by 5UP2 and 5HP also further confirms that the 5\u2032 UTR of PRRSV is a highly productive target region for PPMO, and that this region likely plays an important role in arterivirus replication. A one base mismatch between 6P1 or 7P1 PPMO and their respective target sites in ten North American PRRSV strains may explain the low activity observed. (Fig. 7A and B). It is noteworthy that all 10 strains had identical sequences in both the 6P1 and 7P1 target sites. Thus, a minor sequence modification of PPMO targeting these regions may lead to improved efficacy.",
