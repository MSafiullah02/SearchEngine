It refers to a non\u2010specific and complex phenomenon that occurs in the early stages of inflammation, preceding the development of the acquired immune response (Baumann & Gauldie 1994, Ceron et al. 2005). The APR is a consequence of the production and release of several cytokines, of which interleukin (IL)\u20101, IL\u20106 and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)\u2010\u03b1 are the most relevant (Mart\u00ednez\u2010Subiela et al. 2001, Paltrinieri 2008). These mediators induce various changes in the body including fever, leucocytosis and a modulation of protein synthesis by hepatocytes (Baumann & Gauldie 1994, Ceciliani et al. 2002).",

The most relevant and well described positive APPs in cats are \u03b1\u20101\u2010glycoprotein (AGP) and serum amyloid\u2010A (SAA) (Petersen et al. 2004, Ceron et al. 2005, Paltrinieri 2008, Eckersall & Bell 2010).",

Its increase in different cat infectious diseases has been described (Duthie et al. 1997, Paltrinieri et al. 2004, Paltrinieri et al. 2007a,2007b). In retroviral infected cats, while a previous study reported its increase (Duthie et al. 1997), a more recent one found that FIV positive cats have lower concentrations of AGP than healthy ones (Korman et al. 2012).",

Among the major functions in the immune system, CRP is involved in the activation of the classical complement pathway, the enhancement of phagocytosis or even the modulation of polymorphonuclear cells (Schultz & Arnold 1990). Because CRP does not appear to be involved in the feline acute phase reaction, it has not been very well studied or documented in the cat (Ceron et al. 2005). In human medicine, several studies describe its increase in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive patients (Jahoor et al. 1999, Treitinger et al. 2001), even after immunomodulation therapy with exogenous IL\u20102 (Barbai et al. 2010). Despite the similarity between HIV and FIV (Hosie et al. 2009, Hartmann 2011), the CRP behaviour in FIV positive cats undergoing immunomodulating therapy remains unknown.",

A single\u2010arm study was considered and performed as this is likely to be the most reliable approach when studying naturally infected \u2010animals, for which time of infection and sub\u2010types of the virus are uncertain. In this study, rFeIFN\u2010\u03c9 was used according to a licensed protocol, approved for veterinary use in feline retrovirus infections. Although only a few studies have been published, clinical improvement of cats undergoing rFeIFN\u03c9 therapy has been well documented in double arm trials (de Mari et al. 2004, Domenech et al. 2011). This study provides further information regarding parameters complementary to the main clinical signs and concurrent viral excretion data previously published (Gil et al. 2013), clarifying the pathophysiological phenomena behind immune stimulation.",

As such measurement of these parameters for monitoring inflammation stimulus is not without difficulty. Using each individual animal as its own reference was considered to be a practical and reasonable approach to bypass this problem (Ceron et al. 2005). Therefore, as in previous human studies that evaluated APPs (Wasunna et al. 1995, Barbai et al. 2010), animals acted as their own controls and the time point before therapy (D0) was considered the baseline value for each cat. Subsequently, it was possible to study the individual trends during therapy.",

Groups were not statistically different with the exception of AGP on D30. This particular variation is secondary to the fact that the FIV group demonstrated lower AGP values compared to FeLV and co\u2010infected cats. Despite the low number of animals a possible explanation may be sub\u2010clinical diseases leading to a particular alteration at this time point. However, considering that the statistical difference was only evident at this particular time point, this finding was not considered biologically significant. According to previous studies which reported that AGP and SAA are good predictors of immunomodulation (Kajikawa et al. 1999, Hochepied et al. 2003), these results support the hypothesis that rFeIFN\u2010\u03c9 therapy may modulate pro\u2010inflammatory innate mechanisms.

As for AGP at D30, this may have been due to various causes such as sub\u2010clinical uncontrolled infections in the shelter or even a natural progression of retroviral disease. From the beginning (D0) until the end of the treatment (D65) a significant increase of CRP concentrations was noted. Although CRP has not been considered as a useful biomarker of inflammation in cats, this study shows that this APP behaves similarly to SAA and AGP. Therefore, in contrast with previous studies, CRP may also have value as a biomarker of feline inflammation, being increased in a similar magnitude to the other APPs measured.",

This study revealed that \u2010pre\u2010existing FIV infection did not significantly affect the APR to mycoplasma. Despite remaining within the RI, FIV positive cats demonstrated lower concentrations of AGP than non\u2010FIV cats. This contrasted with previous studies suggesting that AGP was increased in FIV cats (Duthie et al. 1997). Taking all these into account, it seems reasonable to consider that FIV cats are able to develop an efficient acute phase, which may lead to a rise of APPs. Regarding the more conventional assessments of the immune system in retroviral infected cats, a previous study concluded that the hyperglobulinaemia commonly observed in FIV cats may be due to hyperactivation of B\u2010cells which is more evident when the disease progresses (Gleich & Hartmann 2009). In contrast, and due to a progressive defect of helper T\u2010cells, FeLV cats do not usually present with hyperglobulinaemia being more prone to have severe cytopenias (Gleich & Hartmann 2009). According to this study, the increase of APPs was similar in FIV and FeLV, suggesting that the innate\u2010immune stimulation must have the same basis in these two groups. No studies were performed to correlate \u03b3\u2010globulins with APPs in retroviral infected cats, and whether rFeIFN\u2010\u03c9 interferes with serum protein electrophoresis profiles remains unclear.",

Clinical signs, evaluated by a score\u2010scale, decreased in the three groups (FIV, FeLV and co\u2010infected) meaning an overall improvement of symptomatic cats. In total, 10 of 16 improved their clinical signs while 6 of 16 remained stable. Furthermore, a significant decrease in excretion of other viruses was also observed concomitantly (Gil et al. 2013). Correlating the APP profile with these previous results, it was observed that APP concentrations increased in cats with concurrently improved clinical signs and reduced viral excretion. This finding was consistent even in cats with low clinical scores and in those where scores remained stable with therapy. Recognising that APPs may be increased in different situations such as chronic infections and severe inflammation (Ceron et al. 2005, Paltrinieri 2008), this concurrent clinical improvement and the decrease in the loads of other viruses reinforce and sustain the hypothesis that rFeIFN\u2010\u03c9 therapy potentiates the immune response and may involve a beneficial APP increase in treated animals.",

In humans, it has been described that the administration of IL\u20102 in HIV patients induced an increase of CRP, which was positively correlated to an increase of CD4+ cell count (Barbai et al. 2010). These findings reported a possible involvement of CRP in the IL2\u2010induced immune stimulation (Barbai et al. 2010). Conversely, it was previously described that CD4/CD8 ratios do not change in cats under rFeIFN\u2010\u03c9 (Domenech et al. 2011). Therefore, the true mechanism by which rFeIFN\u2010\u03c9 induces an increase in APP remains unclear. To further characterise the immune response during rFeIFN\u2010\u03c9 therapy, further studies are required to correlate these findings with other parameters such as the cytokine profile. For now, the results of this study suggest that APPs may be promising predictors of innate\u2010immune stimulation in naturally retroviral infected cats undergoing rFeIFN\u2010\u03c9 therapy. In the future, they could be combined together in an APP\u2010panel that may help with the individual monitoring and assessment of rFeIFN\u2010\u03c9 therapy.",
