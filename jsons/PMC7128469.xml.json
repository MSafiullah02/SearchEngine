            "text": "Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination is an essential part of the diagnostic work-up of patients with suspected central nervous system (CNS) viral infections. It is often the means to achieve an etiological diagnosis, either by the direct identification of the responsible virus, or by the demonstration of an intrathecal specific immune response. Traditional direct virological techniques, including virus isolation, antigen detection and microscopy examination, usually have low sensitivity. Only virus isolation in cell culture may be of some value for diagnosis of aseptic meningitis, with enteroviruses found in almost half of the cases. Virus isolation, however, is insensitive for other viruses, such as herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) and most arboviruses. Virus antigen detection techniques and light or electron microscopy are of limited value, as they require a high number of CSF-infected cells for virus identification (Rubin, 1983). On the other hand, indirect diagnosis by detection of intrathecally produced antibodies generally has poor sensitivity during the early stages of the disease.",

Their advantages, accounting for their success in diagnostic neurovirology, have been the extraordinary sensitivity and rapidity. These techniques were first applied to CSF in the early 90s, for the diagnosis of herpes simplex encephalitis (HSE), and enteroviral meningitis (Puchhammer-St\u00f6ckl et al., 1990, Rotbart, 1990). Since then, the number of scientific reports in this field has rapidly increased and NA amplification-based assays are now routinely performed in most diagnostic laboratories.",

Furthermore, they have been useful to establish a viral etiology in neurological syndromes of dubious origin, e.g., Mollaret's meningitis (Tedder et al., 1994), or to help recognise unusual or poorly characterised CNS diseases, such as mild forms of herpes encephalitis (Schlesinger et al., 1995a, DeVincenzo and Thorne, 1994, Domingues et al., 1997, Fodor et al., 1998) or cytomegalovirus (CMV) ventriculoencephalitis in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients (Arribas et al., 1996). Molecular methods have made it possible to identify viruses in CSF normally causing extracerebral infections, such as rotavirus, parvovirus B19, CMV or human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6), thus supporting their etiological role in inducing CNS disease (Kondo et al., 1993, Suga et al., 1993, Cassinotti et al., 1993, Ushijima et al., 1994, Studahl et al., 1995, McCullers et al., 1995, Barah et al., 2001).

However, the relatively simple CSF composition may obviate, at least for DNA viruses, the need for NA purification. The simplest approaches include heating to high temperatures or repeated freeze-thawing of the specimens, procedures that facilitate cell membrane disruption and release of DNA (Table 1\n). These procedures have the advantage of being rapid, requiring small CSF volumes, and reducing the risk of sample contamination during NA purification steps. However, the lack of removal of inhibiting molecules might interfere with the enzymes used for amplification. NAs may also be concentrated and/or purified from CSF, by a number of in-house procedures or commercial kits (Table 1). Although some extraction methods seem to perform better than others in comparative studies (Casas et al., 1995, Fahle and Fischer, 2000), none of the known protocols has been shown to be clearly superior. Practically, the choice of one CSF preparation method is supported by a number of considerations, including the type of NA target and the amplification protocol employed, as well as the individual laboratory experience.",

The simplest technique is based on the visualisation of DNA bands of the expected size by agarose gel electrophoresis after staining with ethidium-bromide. Alternative or supportive methods include hybridisation with DNA probes complementary to the target DNA, following DNA transfer to a filter, tubes, or microplates. Probes are labelled with enzymes or other molecules that lead to signal detection on appropriate stimulation. Colorimetric enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA), in which the amplified products is captured by a probe coated to a microplate, have proved to be very practical. For this reason colorimetric ELISAs have largely been adapted to commercial kits and used for CSF analysis for a number of viruses (Rotbart et al., 1994, Ellis et al., 1997, Bestetti et al., 2001).",

An important requirement of this approach is that the amplification conditions, i.e. reagent mixture composition and thermocycling profile, are similar for all the primer pairs, in order not to compromise amplification efficiency for each primer pair. Developments of multiplex PCR might lead to universal diagnostic protocols, based on the use of several primer pairs with fixed thermocycle programs and reagent composition (Kuno, 1998). Multiplex PCR assays are largely employed in diagnostic neurovirology, e.g. for simultaneous detection of HSV-1 and HSV-2 (Kimura et al., 1990, Cassinotti et al., 1996, Cinque et al., 1998a), or of a larger number of herpesviruses (Tenorio et al., 1993, Baron et al., 1996, Pozo and Tenorio, 1999, Quereda et al., 2000, Markoulatos et al., 2001). Protocols have also been designed for simultaneous amplification of viruses causing similar clinical pictures. These include assays for herpesvirus and enterovirus (Read and Kurtz, 1999, Casas et al., 1999), for measles, rubella and parvovirus B19 (del Mar Mosquera et al., 2002) or for different combinations of mosquito-transmitted viruses (Lee et al., 2002). A duplex PCR protocol for the amplification of Epstein\u2013Barr virus (EBV) and Toxoplasma gondii has also been proposed in AIDS patients to help distinguish CNS lymphoma from toxoplasmosis (Roberts and Storch, 1997).",

Following amplification, the product may be identified by DNA sequencing, by hybridisation with specific probes or by restriction-enzyme analysis (Fig. 2\n), or, when possible, by visualisation of bands of different size on agarose gel. This strategy has widely and successfully been used with herpesviruses: to amplify simultaneously HSV-1, HSV-2, CMV and EBV by means of primers targeting conserved region of the herpesvirus DNA polymerase gene (Rozenberg and Lebon, 1991), to detect all the known human herpesviruses in two PCR assays (Johnson et al., 2000) or most of them in a single reaction through the use of \u2018stair primers\u2019 (Minjolle et al., 1999, Bouquillon et al., 2000).

Clinical specimens or products of previous amplifications (carry-over) are the most common source of contamination. In order to minimize this risk, it is recommended to maintain CSF sterility in all the pre-laboratory and laboratory steps and to carry out the different laboratory steps in separate areas (Persing, 1991). In addition, some laboratories use the enzyme uracil N-glycosilase (UNG), which degrades products from previous amplifications but not native NA templates, to prevent carry-over of amplification products. This is accomplished by substituting dUTP for dTTP in the amplification mixture, and pretreating all subsequent mixtures with UNG prior to amplification (Longo et al., 1990). More in general, the use of negative controls, usually water or known negative samples tested in parallel with the CSF specimens throughout the whole procedure, and analysis of samples in duplicate, are useful to recognise false positive results.",

However, recovery of enterovirus RNA in CSF seems not to be reduced by storage at 4 \u00b0C or room temperature for 96 h after sampling (Rotbart et al., 1985). Similarly, no significant decay of HIV-1 RNA load was observed after up to 96 h of storage at 4 \u00b0C (Ahmad et al., 1999).

This approach has now largely replaced the identification of HSV in brain tissue biopsies as the method of choice for the etiological diagnosis of HSE (Linde et al., 1997, Tang et al., 1999). A number of retrospective and prospective studies have demonstrated the reliability of PCR methods, reporting a sensitivity higher than 90% and a virtually 100% specificity (Aurelius et al., 1991, Lakeman and Whitley, 1995, Linde et al., 1997). Furthermore, NA amplification techniques enable the diagnosis of uncommon forms of HSV CNS infection that might otherwise go unrecognised (Schlesinger et al., 1995b, DeVincenzo and Thorne, 1994, Domingues et al., 1997, Fodor et al., 1998). Most importantly, CSF analysis by these techniques is rapid, making the laboratory diagnosis useful for management decisions. However, it is important that the PCR results are interpreted cautiously in relation to the clinical presentation and the duration of antiviral therapy. Initially negative PCR results have been observed very early after onset of HSE symptoms, likely to reflect a still limited virus replication (Rozenberg and Lebon, 1991, Puchhammer-St\u00f6ckl et al., 2001). On the other hand, the likelihood of finding a positive CSF PCR result is reduced following a few days of acyclovir treatment, as well as in untreated patients from whom CSF is obtained late after onset of neurological symptoms (Rozenberg and Lebon, 1991, Aurelius et al., 1991, Lakeman and Whitley, 1995).",

Protocols have been designed with primers that recognise almost all of the enterovius serotypes, including those that can not be isolated in cell systems. Exceptions are Echo viruses 22 and 23 that diverge extremely from the other serotypes (Oberste et al., 1998). Because of the enhanced sensitivity of NA amplification methods, the virus can also be detected in CSF samples obtained a few days after onset of symptoms, where isolation of virus is usually infrequent (Yerly et al., 1996). Furthermore, the use of these techniques has reduced the time for diagnosis from 4\u201310 days to 1 day. The diagnostic reliability of both in-house and commercial NA amplification assays has been extensively evaluated, showing a >90% sensitivity and 48\u201389% specificity when compared to viral isolation. The low specificity probably reflects enterovirus detection in culture-negative CSF samples from patients with true enterovirus meningitis (Glimaker et al., 1993, Lina et al., 1996, Yerly et al., 1996, Muir and van Loon, 1997, Romero, 1999).",

            "text": "Although highly sensitive methods have been developed for detection of viral genomes in patient samples for most of the important arbo- and rodent-borne viruses, these methods are in many cases of limited value in the routine diagnostics. The major reason is that the time period for the viremia is often very short, i.e. the virus is usually no longer detectable at the onset of systemic or CNS disease. A typical example is tick-borne encephalitis (TBE), where attempts to use RT-PCR to tract TBE virus RNA in acute phase CSF or serum have to large extent been unsuccessful, with only a few samples having been found positive in the sero-negative, or in the IgM-positive but IgG-negative, phases (G\u00fcnther, 1997, Puchhammer-St\u00f6ckl et al., 1995; Lundkvist et al., unpublished observation). Other examples where detection of viral genomes is of limited use, and the diagnostics have to be based, or at least supplemented, by serology, are Japanese encephalitis (Igarachi et al., 1994), encephalitis caused by the Western, Eastern and Venezuelan equine encephalitis, and the Dengue viruses. On the other hand, the use of RT-PCR in CSF has rendered more positive results for other flaviviruses, such as West Nile virus, or Bunyaviruses, e.g. La Crosse, Jamestown Canyon or Toscana viruses. Real-time PCR analysis of CSF samples collected from patients with serologically confirmed West Nile encephalitis during the 1999 epidemics in the New York area, revealed a 57% sensitivity and 100% specificity, respectively (Lanciotti et al., 2000). Although a correlation was observed between positivity rate and survival, this observation remains to be confirmed (Briese et al., 2000). Toscana virus, a phlebotomus-transmitted virus causing an endemic infection in the Tuscany area of Italy is the responsible of benign forms of meningitis. By RT-PCR, Toscana virus sequences have been identified in CSF from as many as in 30% of patients with acute meningitis who were hospitalised in this geographic area. These findings not only indicate NA amplification analysis as a valid diagnostic support, but also as a means for estimating the relevance of this disease in the population (Valassina et al., 2000).",

            "text": "Neurological complications is one of the major problems in patients with HIV infection. Although their frequency has significantly declined in the developed world following the advent of highly active anti-retroviral therapies (HAART), they still represent a major diagnostic and therapeutic challenge. CNS diseases caused by viruses include encephalitis, meningitis, myelitis or mixed pictures caused by herpesviruses, and progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), associated with JCV infection of the CNS. In this field, the impact of diagnostic molecular techniques has been remarkable (Cinque et al., 1997a). Detection of CMV DNA in CSF has shown to be highly sensitive and specific for the diagnosis of CMV encephalitis, a disease reported in as many as one third of AIDS patients (Cinque et al., 1992, Gozlan et al., 1992, Wolf and Spector, 1992, Clifford et al., 1993, Fox et al., 1995, Cinque et al., 1998b). The identification of HSV-1, HSV-2 and varicella-zoster virus DNA in CSF has largely contributed to identify and clinically characterise the CNS complications induced by these viruses, and also provided a useful tool for their diagnosis and clinical management (Tan et al., 1993, Miller et al., 1995, Burke et al., 1997, Cinque et al., 1997a, Cinque et al., 1998a, Iten et al., 1999). CSF PCR for JCV has partly replaced the practice of brain biopsy as diagnostic method of choice for PML, though JCV sequences are demonstrated by PCR in only two thirds of the patients, with higher rates of detection in the more advanced stages of disease (Weber et al., 1994, Fong et al., 1995, McGuire et al., 1995, Cinque et al., 1996a, de Luca et al., 1996). Furthermore, clearance of JCV DNA from CSF has frequently been observed in patients receiving HAART, in association with PML stabilisation (Miralles et al., 1998, Giudici et al., 2000), suggesting that the rate of JCV DNA detection among PML patients might further decrease as a consequence of anti-HIV therapy. Another virus-related CNS disease in HIV-infected patients is primary CNS lymphoma (PCNSL), which is almost always associated with the presence of EBV in the tumour cells (MacMahon et al., 1991). Studies in patients with histologically proven PCNSL or CNS localization of systemic non-Hodgkin lymphomas have reported a striking association between the presence of these complications and EBV DNA detection in CSF. In some patients, EBV-DNA could even be detected days or months before the lymphoma manifested itself clinically (Cinque et al., 1993, Arribas et al., 1995a, de Luca et al., 1995, Cinque et al., 1996b, Cingolani et al., 2000).",

Both PCR and other NA amplification techniques have been proven to be reliable for this purpose, and a variety of semi-quantitative and quantitative PCR methods are described (Clementi et al., 1996, Hodinka, 1998, Preiser et al., 2000). Semi-quantitative techniques include methods based on limiting dilution of samples before amplification, or comparison of the extent of amplification between samples and \u2018external\u2019 standards at known NA concentration. The main disadvantage of these procedures is that they do not take into account the possible differences in amplification efficiency between the different samples and/or standards. Quantitative techniques allow a more accurate estimate of the NA levels, through co-amplification in the same tube of target NA and an \u2018internal\u2019 standard at a known concentration, which enables control of the amplification efficiency.",

            "text": "New automated procedures based on real-time detection of NAs are becoming popular in diagnostic neurovirology. The real-time PCR is based on detection and quantification of a fluorescent reporter. Fluorescence emission is recorded at each cycle making it possible to monitor the PCR reaction during its exponential phase, where the amount of PCR product correlates to the initial quantity of template. Compared to classical methods where the amounts of DNA are measured at the end of amplification, when the amplification efficiency is reduced, real-time PCR is more accurate and expands the dynamic range of quantification. It also eliminates post-PCR processing of amplification products, resulting in reduced risk of contamination and increased speed (Bustin, 2000). There are two general methods for NA quantitation by real-time PCR: those based on the use of DNA-binding dyes, e.g. syber green, or of fluorescence-labelled probes. The latter are employed in the TaqMan (Fig. 3\n) (Holland et al., 1991, Higuchi et al., 1993, Heid et al., 1996) and LightCycler (Wittwer et al., 1997a, Wittwer et al., 1997b) technology, that have both been described for quantitation of viral DNA in CSF (Kessler et al., 2000, Verstrepen et al., 2001, Gunther et al., 2001, Nagai et al., 2001, Read et al., 2001, Gautheret-Dejean et al., 2002, Aberle and Puchhammer-St\u00f6ckl, 2002) (Table 4\n).

In addition, genotyping of viruses in CSF may be used to recognise unusual viral strains or to characterise new viral pathogens involved in CNS disease. There are a number of post-amplification methods described, recently reviewed elsewhere (Arens, 1999). Among these, DNA sequencing, restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) and hybridisation-based techniques have all been used in neurovirology.",

Automated procedures have been developed during recent years, making sequencing relatively easy to perform (Fig. 4\n). By RFLP, restriction enzymes are used to digest NAs into fragments of different size, which can be visualised by gel electrophoresis. This technique can be used after CSF PCR with consensus primers to distinguish individual viruses or viral strains (Fig. 2) (Rozenberg and Lebon, 1991, Arthur et al., 1989). Hybridisation-based techniques include classical procedures, such as the Southern Blot, as well as modern high stringency hybridisation. The latter identifies minimal variations in the genome composition, such as single mutations. An example is the reverse hybridisation technique, incorporated into the commercial Line Probe Assay (LIPA), that has been used to detect HIV resistance mutations in CSF and plasma pairs (Cunningham et al., 2000). DNA microarrays, or \u2018DNA chip\u2019 technology might become an additional tool for the identification and genomic analysis of virus sequences amplified in the CSF (Pease et al., 1994, Lockhart and Winzeler, 2000, McGlennen, 2001). Despite high costs and current limited availability of technology and instrumentation, the DNA chip technology is in rapid development in virology, especially in the field of research, e.g. for measuring viral gene expression (Chambers et al., 1999, Jenner et al., 2001). Sequences from plasma or other clinical samples have initially been tested for epidemiological or diagnostic purposes, such as screening for multiple HIV-1 drug resistance mutations (Wilson et al., 2000).",

Similarly, a newly described B adenovirus was unexpectedly identified by molecular techniques during the 1997 epidemic of enterovirus 71-associated encephalitis in Malaysia (Cardosa et al., 1999).",

An example is the detection of EBV in CSF of patients diagnosed with other CNS infections, such as HSE or HIV-related opportunistic infections (Cinque et al., 1996b, Tang et al., 1997, Studahl et al., 1998, Portolani et al., 1998). Theoretically, this finding might result from sliding of virus or latently infected lymphocytes through an impaired blood-CSF barrier, but also from reactivation of EBV infection in the CNS (Bossolasco et al., 2002). Viral genomes have also been found in the CSF of patients with non-infectious CNS diseases. For instance, both JCV and HHV-6 genomes have been demonstrated in patients with multiple sclerosis, though their etiologic role in this disease has never been confirmed (Ferrante et al., 1998, Liedtke et al., 1995).",

            "text": "Elevated cost is a potential disadvantage of CSF examination by NA amplification techniques. Taking into account only expenses for technical equipment, reagents, and disposables, the cost per sample of a basic PCR usually varies between approximately 20 and 200 US$ or \u20ac. In-house developed assays are the cheapest to perform and costs can be further reduced by avoiding, when possible, expensive procedures for CSF preparation and NA detection, or by using assays for simultaneous examination of multiple viruses. Commercial assays have some advantages, including standardisation and, sometimes, automation (Jungkind, 2001), but are much more expensive. In general, the savings of establishing a rapid diagnosis often overcome the costs of NA amplification techniques (Ross, 1999). In the diagnosis of HSE, the CSF PCR approach is evidently much cheaper than brain biopsy, but it seems cost-effective also when compared to empirical initiation of antiviral therapy. Using a decision analysis model, the use of CSF PCR was associated with better outcome, and, on the other hand, with significant savings of acyclovir, resulting from higher rate of correct drug discontinuation in PCR-negative patients (Tebas et al., 1998). In aseptic meningitis, cost savings seem to be increased by adopting a PCR testing procedure, as compared to standard practice, especially during the year season characterised by higher enterovirus infection prevalence. Early demonstration of an enterovirus as causative agent is associated with reduced requests for other diagnostic examinations, duration of empirical antibiotic treatments and periods of hospitalisation (Swingler et al., 1994, Rice et al., 1995, Marshall et al., 1997, Ramers et al., 2000).",

Different protocols are in use for each virus in the different laboratories and reference standards for the evaluation of assay sensitivity are often lacking, making it difficult to compare results among laboratories (Saldanha, 2001). Furthermore, testing of CSF might be subjected to laboratory errors, due to inaccurate test validation, quality of reagents and equipment or staff training (Garrett, 2001). To help obviate these problems, quality control (QC) programmes are being carried out for viruses and other infectious agents. QC assessments for viruses responsible of CNS infections, including enteroviruses, HSV-1, HSV-2 and JCV, have been performed as a part of European Union sponsored QC in virology programmes (van Vliet et al., 1998, Muir et al., 1999, van Loon et al., 1999, Weber et al., 1997, Schloss et al., 2001). These are based on the use of panels consisting of coded samples containing known amounts of NA molecules and control samples, which are distributed to participant laboratories and therein tested blindly. Analysis of reported results has commonly revealed substantial different reports between laboratories, especially with samples containing low amounts of NA. Furthermore, a significant rate of false positive results has been observed (Muir et al., 1999, Schloss et al., 2001). On the other hand, little or no relationship is generally found between performance and the use of in-house rather than commercial techniques.",

Over the last 10 years, the spectrum of clinical conditions that can be recognised has largely expanded and diagnostic reliability significantly improved. Quantitative methods have provided a valuable additional tool for clinical management of these diseases, whereas post-amplification techniques have enabled precise characterisation of viral genomes following their recovery in the CSF. Current efforts are aiming at improvement of the diagnostic efficiency of molecular techniques, in both frequent and less common infections. They also will increase the diagnostic speed and standardisation.",

The amplified DNA is purified from unincorporated primers and nucleotides and added to the sequencing reaction mixture. The products of the sequencing reaction are subected to automated electrophoresis and recognized by a laser scanner. A four-color electropherogram is produced, which is translated into a linear nucleotide sequence by a computer software. The final sequence is compared to reference sequences, e.g., HXB2 for HIV-1. Three nucleotide mutations, resulting in two aminoacid substitutions at codons 215 (treonin\u2192phenylalanin) and 219 (lysin\u2192glutamin) are found in plasma but not in SCF (arrows). Such mutations are associated with resistance to the RT inhibitor drug zidovudine.",
