Rituximab has been associated with serious infections, including Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP) and the reactivation of hepatitis B virus (HBV) and tuberculosis (TB). The risk of infection appears to be the result of a variety of mechanisms, including prolonged B cell depletion, B-cell-Tcell crosstalk, panhypogammaglobulinemia, lateonset neutropenia, and blunting of the immune response after vaccination. Particular attention should be given to strategies to minimize the risk of infectious complications, including vaccinating against bacterial and viral pathogens, monitoring white cell count and immunoglobulin levels, prophylaxis against PJP, and screening for HBV and TB [2] .",

[9] analyzed the risk of HBV reactivation in hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-negative/hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc)-positive kidney transplant patients receiving rituximab desensitization. Patients were divided into rituximab (n = 49) or control (n = 123) groups. All patients were observed for HBV reactivation, which was defined as the reappearance of hepatitis B surface antigen or HBV DNA. During the follow-up period (median, 58 months; range, 4-95 months), five patients (10.2%) in the rituximab group and two patients (1.6%) in the control group experienced HBV reactivation (P = 0.003). In the rituximab group, two patients experienced HBV-related severe hepatitis, and one patient died due to hepatic failure. The median time from rituximab desensitization to HBV reactivation was 11 months (range, 5-22 months). By contrast, no patients in the control group experienced severe hepatitis. The status of hepatitis B surface antibody was similar between groups. Rituximab desensitization [hazard ratio (HR), 9.18 ; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1. 74-48.86 ; P = 0.009] and hepatitis B surface antibody status (HR 4.74; 95% CI 1.05-21.23, P = 0.04) were significant risk factors for HBV reactivation. Rituximab desensitization for incompatible kidney transplantation significantly increased the risk of HBV reactivation in HBsAgnegative/anti-HBc-positive patients. Therefore, close monitoring of HBV DNA is required in these patients.",

The mean time of onset, from the last RTX infusion until symptom development or relevant abnormal radiological change was 30 days (range 0-158 days). Abnormal radiological findings were similar in all patients, with diffuse bilateral lung infiltrates apparent on chest radiographs and/or thoracic CT. Hypoxemia was seen in all cases and pulmonary function tests were uniformly abnormal with a characteristic diffusion capacity deficit and restrictive ventilatory pattern. RTX-ILD was fatal in 18 cases.",

Patient was preloaded with dual anti-platelets. Coronary angiogram showed 100% occlusion of proximal RCA. Thrombosuction of this culprit right coronary artery revealed underlying 90% stenosis. After that, balloon angioplasty of RCA was done. The procedure was terminated in the view of successful balloon angioplasty with good flow. He was kept on dual antiplatelet therapy for 1 month with regular platelet monitoring. With the grow-ing increasing global use of rituximab for various oncological and immunological diseases, this complication of myocardial infarction should be kept in mind. They recommend that patients with known cardiovascular risk factors should be assessed for ischemic heart disease before treatment and be carefully monitored during and after treatment especially during first infusion when tumor burden is highest with a slow initial infusion rate, followed by increasing the rate in 30-min increments as tolerated. This lifethreatening cardiovascular complication should also be kept in mind while using rituximab in patients without cardiovascular risk factors. The mechanism by which rituximab elicits infusion reactions remains unclear, although the symptoms associated with the reactions are thought to be related to the release of inflammatory cytokines. The incidence of infusion reactions was highest during the first infusion (77%) and decreased with each subsequent infusion. Adverse events can include urticaria, hypotension, angioedema, hypoxia, pulmonary infiltrates, acute respiratory distress syndrome, myocardial infarction, ventricular fibrillation, or cardiogenic shock.

The 26S proteasome specifically degrades ubiquitinated proteins and eliminates unnecessary, misfolded, and malfunctioning proteins, in addition to proteins involved in cell cycle regulation and oncogenesis. Bortezomib, a modified dipeptidyl boronic acid, is a reversible inhibitor of the 26S proteasome. Its ability to trigger apoptosis of bone marrowderived plasma cells has led to its approved and widespread use in multiple myeloma. Bortezomib also shows several additional immunological effects that have resulted in its increasing utility in AMR and desensitization protocols. Bortezomib mediates apoptosis of activated T ells by preventing degradation of IkB and blocking nuclear factor-kB and subsequent transcription of interleukin-1, interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor-a. Specifically, bortezomib induces the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, which translocates proapoptotic proteins and enhances caspase activities. Bortezomib suppresses the maturation of dendritic cells, which present antigens to T cells including the HLA antigens. Bortezomib inhibits angiogenesis by reducing VEGF and interleukin-release by tumor cells and prevents adaptation to hypoxia. In chronic allograft injury, a lymphangiogenesis process is involved so this inhibition could further disrupt rejection from taking place [35] .

These data suggest that bortezomib-induced plasma cell depletion triggers humoral compensation. On the basis of the effect of bortezomib on PC and in vivo compensation, they suggest that bortezomib should not be used alone for desensitization, because bortezomib depletion of PCs will lead to a compensatory response, which is likely to be deleterious to an allograft. They suggest that desensitization regimens incorporating the unique effect of bortezomib should be designed on the basis of its mechanistic effects and limitations and that adjuvant B cell depletion, blocking of GC initiation, or strategies to prevent GC compensation should be considered.",

Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) is used for the treatment of a number of inflammatory conditions. Hemolysis due to passive transfer of blood group antibodies is a well-recognized complication of IVIg therapy. Therapy is largely supportive and consists of blood product support and hemodialysis. Welsh [49] report the use of therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) as adjunct therapy for three patients with complications attributed to IVIg. Two patients had hemolysis attributed to IVIg; one patient was blood group A and the other blood group O.",

Thirty minutes following the start of the IVIG infusion, the patient developed crushing retrosternal chest pain and shortness of breath. The pain improved upon discontinuation of IVIG infusion but recurred when IVIG was restarted. The troponin level reached 140 microg/L, and a persantine sestamibi stress test (MIBI) indicated anterolateral ischemia. The patient was diagnosed with non-ST-elevation MI. Although an association between IVIG administration and MI has not been demonstrated in clinical trials, accumulating clinical experience suggests that a relationship between IVIG and myocardial ischemia exists. Twenty published case reports were identified. Risk of acute MI seems to be increased with use of high-dose IVIG and in older individuals, especially those with at least one cardiovascular risk factor, such as ischemic heart disease or hypertension.",

After IdeS infusion (0.12 mg/kg \u00d7 2) and when the HLA-incompatible donor (HLA-B7 + ) kidney was offered, the HLA antibody profile was negative. The kidney was transplanted successfully. The percentage of both T cell and B cell PRAs was reduced in all patients within 1 h after IdeS treatment.",

Emerging data from patients with autoimmune diseases treated with TCZ suggest a potent reduction in disease targeted autoantibodies and memory B cells. In addition, recent data also suggest TCZ reduces Th17 cells and deviates naive T cells to Tregs. Reports have shown that tocilizumab also reduces antibody-producing cells, diminishes inflammatory markers, and improves clinical symptomatology in a number of other autoimmune diseases. Anti-IL-6R monoclonal antibody results in significant reductions of alloantibodies, antibody production by splenic and bone marrow plasma cells, direct inhibition of plasma cell anti-HLA antibody production, and induction of T regulatory cells (Tregs) with inhibition of T follicular helper cells (Tfh).",

One patient each had a pulmonary hemorrhage and a subcutaneous hemorrhage during treatment, but there were no other serious complications. At the end of follow-up, patient survival and renal survival were similar in the DFPP and IA groups. DFPP plus immunosuppressive therapy efficiently and safely removed anti-GBM antibodies. The fewer plasma-associated side effects and reduced loss of IgG suggest that DFPP may be a better treatment choice for anti-GBM disease, especially in patients with insufficient plasma. Q: 1. What kind of side effect does plasmapheresis have? 2. Are the complication from plasmapheresis preventable?",
