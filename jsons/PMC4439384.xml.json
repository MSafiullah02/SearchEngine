            "text": "Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is a newly emerged infectious disease caused by a novel \u03b2-coronavirus (\u03b2-CoV), MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV). MERS-CoV was first identified in humans in Saudi Arabia on June 12, 2012 (Zaki et al., 2012). Although the spread of MERS-CoV among humans has been limited, MERS-CoV infection has been linked to several family clusters and healthcare workers (Assiri et al., 2013, Memish et al., 2013b, Memish et al., 2013c), providing evidence for human-to-human transmissibility of the virus. MERS-CoV has demonstrated an increasing trend of infection since its first identification. Sporadic MERS cases have been reported in at least 21 countries in the Middle East, Africa, Europe, Asia and North America. As of November 7, 2014, a total of 909 laboratory-confirmed cases including 331 deaths (mortality rate \u223c36%) were reported (http://www.who.int/csr/don/07-november-2014-mers/en/). The geographic spread and rapid increase of MERS cases during the past several months have raised concerns of pandemic potential, even though the consequences of such pandemic might be less severe than those caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), another \u03b2-CoV which led to a worldwide outbreak in 2003 (Peiris et al., 2003). As a practical control strategy against the potential outbreak of MERS-CoV-caused emerging infectious disease, development of effective vaccines has become a high priority.",

            "text": "A number of studies have pointed out the transmission hosts for MERS-CoV. It is reported that bat-derived coronaviruses, particularly bat coronavirus HKU4, have close phylogenetic relationship with MERS-CoV and that dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), the receptor for MERS-CoV, is also the receptor for HKU4. While HKU4 prefers bat DPP4 over human DPP4, MERS-CoV has adapted to use human DPP4, in addition to bind bat DPP4, suggesting that (1) bats are potential natural reservoirs for MERS-CoV; and (2) bat coronaviruses remain a threat to human health because of their potential for cross-species transmission (Annan et al., 2013, Cui et al., 2013, Ithete et al., 2013, Memish et al., 2013a, Yang et al., 2014). In addition to bats, camels have recently become a focus for the study of MERS-CoV transmission since MERS-CoV neutralizing antibodies and MERS-CoV gene fragments have been identified in dromedary camels, and infectious MERS-CoV has been recovered from infected camels (Briese et al., 2014, Chu et al., 2014, Drosten et al., 2014, Haagmans et al., 2014, Meyer et al., 2014, Nowotny and Kolodziejek, 2014, Reusken et al., 2013). The fact that humans were infected with MERS-CoV after exposure to infected camels suggests that camels are the most likely intermediate transmission hosts of MERS-CoV (Memish et al., 2014). Most recently, MERS-CoV RNA fragments were detected in an air sample collected from the barn that sheltered MERS-CoV-infected camels (Azhar et al., 2014), indicating possible airborne transmission of MERS-CoV between animals and humans. Although the spread of MERS-CoV among humans is limited and inefficient (Drosten et al., 2014), the increased infection rate among healthcare workers during the month of April 2014 (http://www.who.int/csr/disease/coronavirus_infections/archive_updates/en/) has raised concerns of future epidemic potential, which call for the development of effective and safe vaccines to prevent and control MERS (Hotez et al., 2014).",

Second, the HR1/HR2 complex in the S2 subunit forms a fusion core, leading to cell-virus membrane fusion, thereby mediating MERS-CoV entry into the target cells (Gao et al., 2013, Lu et al., 2014). Therefore, like SARS-CoV S protein, the S protein of MERS-CoV plays an essential role in receptor binding, membrane fusion and cell entry. We have previously demonstrated that the S protein, or, more specifically, the RBD, of SARS-CoV played an essential role in developing SARS vaccines (Du et al., 2009a, Jiang et al., 2012b). It is thus expected that the RBD of MERS-CoV S protein will be an important target for developing vaccines against MERS (Lu et al., 2013b, Ma et al., 2014b).",

In addition, full-length infectious cDNA clones of MERS-CoV have been constructed using reverse genetics systems, and relevant infectious viruses could be rescued and propagated in Vero A66 and Huh-7 (human liver) cells (Almaz\u00e1n et al., 2013, Scobey et al., 2013).

The above studies indicate the potential for developing live-attenuated viruses as MERS vaccine candidates.

We have also shown that a truncated 212-amino acid fragment spanning S protein residues 377\u2013588 of MERS-CoV served as a RBD of MERS-CoV (Du et al., 2013a). To identify a critical neutralizing domain in the MERS-CoV RBD as an ideal MERS vaccine candidate, we compared these identified RBD fragments in terms of their antigenicity, DPP4 receptor binding, immunogenicity and neutralizing activity. In order for the recombinant proteins to form suitable conformational structures and maintain sufficient bioactivity, we fused each of these MERS-CoV RBD fragments to the Fc of human IgG and expressed the proteins in a mammalian cell expression system (Fig. 4A). Previously, this same strategy was implemented and proved to be successful in expressing RBD proteins of SARS-CoV and influenza virus (Du et al., 2011, Du et al., 2013d, Li et al., 2013).",

Although all proteins bound efficiently to sDPP4- and DPP4-expressing Huh-7 cells, their binding affinities were notably different, with S377-588-Fc as one of the proteins having the highest DPP4-binding activity (Fig. 4C). Notably, S377-588-Fc also maintained stronger immunogenicity than the other proteins tested, inducing significantly higher IgG antibody responses in immunized mice (Fig. 4D), as well as IgG1 (Th2) and IgG2a (Th1) subtypes. Importantly, S377-588-Fc protein was shown to elicit the highest neutralizing antibody titers against infections from MERS-CoV (Fig. 4E) (Ma et al., 2014b).",

MERS-CoV has been shown to cause transient lower respiratory tract infection in rhesus macaques, and infected monkeys demonstrated clinical signs of diseases, virus replication, histological lesions and neutralizing antibody generation (de Wit et al., 2013b, Yao et al., 2014), demonstrating that monkeys can be used for testing the efficacy of MERS candidate vaccines. However, this MERS-CoV animal model is not affordable for most researchers based on the high cost for purchasing and maintaining monkeys, making it particularly urgent to develop small animal models of MERS-CoV infection (Zhang et al., 2014). Studies have shown that MERS-CoV is susceptible to human and nonhuman primate cell types, including Huh-7, A549, Calu-3, Caco-2 (human) and Vero (African green monkey), but it is not susceptible to BHK (hamster), MEFC57B16 and 3T3 (mouse), or ferret primary kidney cells (Chan et al., 2013a, Tao et al., 2013, van Doremalen et al., 2014). These findings correspond to the observation that MERS-CoV infects human and nonhuman primates, but it does not replicate in small animals, such as Syrian hamsters, mice and ferrets (Coleman et al., 2014b, de Wit et al., 2013a, Devitt, 2013, Raj et al., 2014, van Doremalen et al., 2014).",

In particular, it has been shown that mice are susceptible to MERS-CoV infection after prior transduction with an adenoviral vector expressing the receptor of MERS-CoV, human DPP4, with infected mice developing pneumonia accompanied by inflammatory cell infiltration and histopathological changes (Zhao et al., 2014). Thus, such small animal models can provide a practical platform and an affordable means for evaluating the efficacy of current MERS-CoV vaccines. Accordingly, transgenic DPP4 mouse models that integrate human DPP4 genes into the mouse genome are being established in several laboratories (http://www.nature.com/news/biologists-make-first-mouse-model-for-mers-1.14634) and are expected to be tested for vaccine efficacy in the near future.",

While viral vector-based and live-attenuated virus-based vaccines have potential for providing effective immunity, subunit vaccines will offer the safest means for prevention. Although subunit-based vaccines might induce less immunogenicity than the other vaccine types, their efficacy can be significantly improved by rational design based on the structural analysis of RBD of MERS-CoV S protein and by identification of the most stable and critical neutralizing fragment of RBD, while eliminating non-neutralizing epitopes through immunofocusing (Ma et al., 2014b). Overall, our strategies in the development of MERS-CoV RBD-based subunit vaccines will provide useful information for the design of effective vaccines against MERS-CoV and any other emerging coronaviruses that might cause future pandemics. It is expected that such developed MERS candidate vaccines will be tested for efficacy in preventing MERS-CoV infections in vivo once affordable small animal models for MERS-CoV have become available. Because serologic and neutralization responses against S proteins of MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV and other coronaviruses share no, to low, levels of cross-reactivity within and/or across subgroups, it is advisable that MERS-CoV and other coronavirus vaccines be designed by considering construction of chimeric S protein containing neutralizing epitopes from variant virus strains (Agnihothram et al., 2014).",
