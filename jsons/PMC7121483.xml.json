            "text": "HCoV were first isolated in the mid-1960s from patients with upper respiratory tract disease (1\u20133). As described by McIntosh (4), the identification of coronaviruses in clinical samples was a very difficult task until the 1970s, as HCoV induced subtle or nonexistent cytopathic effects, and many cells types were not susceptible to the virus. Commonly, HCoV-OC43 (ATCC: VR-759) was grown and maintained on BS-C-1 (ATCC: CCL-26), RD (ATCC: CCL-136) or HRT-18 (also called HCT-8; ATCC: CCL-224) cell lines. On the other hand, HCoV-229E (ATCC: VR-740) was grown and maintained on WI-38 (ATCC: CCL-75), MRC-5 (ATCC: CCL-171) or L-132 (ATCC: CCL-5) cell lines. Interestingly, cells from the central nervous system (CNS) were reported to be highly susceptible to HCoV replication. The SK-N-SH (ATCC: HTB-11) neuroblastoma and H4 (ATCC: HTB-148) neuroglioma cell lines were highly susceptible to infection, as well as astrocytoma cell lines U-87 MG (ATCC: HTB-14), U-373 MG, and GL-15 (5\u20138). Even though it was reported that HCoV-229E infectious titers could be determined by plaque assay on specific cell lines, such as MRC-5 or L-132 (6), this proved not to be a reliable assay and, as for HCoV-OC43, an alternative assay was required: an indirect immunoperoxidase assay (IPA) on coronavirus-susceptible cells to quantify infectious virus in biological samples.",

The principle of the IPA technique is that a specific antibody recognizes and binds to its specific antigen to yield an antibody-antigen complex. For detection of these complexes, the primary antibody is either directly labeled with HRP or remains unlabeled, with detection achieved by a labeled secondary antibody. If a secondary antibody is used, it must be generated against the immunoglobulins of the animal species in which the primary antibody was produced. The enzyme substrate, 3,3'-diaminobenzidine (DAB) is then converted by HRP to a precipitating brown end-product.",
