Current epidemiological data shows that person-to-person transmission of coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is more likely to be occurring [1], [2], [3], [4]. As of March 22, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported 267,013 confirmed cases, including 11,201 deaths, in 184 countries and regions. The virus spreads mainly between people who are in close contact (6 feet) with an infected person through respiratory pathways, though it can also be transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces or objects. In this case, every individual is potentially susceptible to the virus as no vaccine is currently available. Data from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention indicates that leading up to February 11, 2020, a total of 1716 healthcare workers became infected and five had died (0.3%) [5]. In addition, according to a more recent report from the Italian Institute of Higher Health and National Federation of surgeons and Dentists, from 1st to 23rd March 2020, 4826 healthcare workers were infected with COVID-19 (9% of confirmed cases) and 18 had died.",

Because of the 14-day latency, it was speculated that they were infected with the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 between late December 2019 and early January 2020. Notably, at that time, many important questions involving the SARS-CoV-2 infections remained unanswered, including its ability and duration of transmission in humans and clinical consequences of human infections. Unfortunately, a substantial number of healthcare workers were infected in healthcare settings before the end of January 2020. Although SARS-CoV-2 itself is significantly infectious, it should not be held fully responsible for the extensive spread of the infection. In fact, the main reasons for earlier virus transmission to healthcare workers were due to lack of awareness of adequate protection of healthcare workers and leaders in health-care settings, and later transmissions were as a result of insufficient supply of protective devices (Fig. 2). Moreover, to date, there is zero infection among the 42, 322 medical staff from across China who voluntarily came to Wuhan to support local medical healthcare professionals from 25th January to 26th March 2020. This suggests that high-grade protection and social distancing are crucial strategies to prevent transmission in hospitals.",

Specifically, we need to be wary of the current COVID-19 outbreak turning into a sustained epidemic or even a pandemic associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. Though SARS-CoV-2 put all health organizations in China on high alert [9], mounting evidence shows that the viral shedding of asymptomatic or mild cases of SARS-CoV-2 spread to infect others [10-13]. This may explain why the virus SARS-CoV-2 spread so quickly in Europe and is now swiftly circulating around the world. Before the WHO declared COVID-19 a pandemic on March 11, 2020, the Italian government did not implement strong measures through public health interventions, including case detection, wearing protective masks, closing public spaces, cancelling public gatherings, and self-isolation at home. Moreover, insufficient protective supplies fueled the infection of healthcare workers in hospitals. All these factors contributed to the current pandemic in Italy and other hardest hit countries such as Spain, France, Iran, United Kingdom and the United States of America.",
