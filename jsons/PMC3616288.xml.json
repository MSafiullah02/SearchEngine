Variants of the dilysine motif have been characterized, in particular a KxHxx retrieval motif in the tail of the spike protein of group I coronaviruses (Lontok et al, 2004), and the RKxx motif present in the Golgi-localized Scyl1 protein (Burman et al, 2008). The dilysine motif is recognized by coatomer subunits (Cosson and Letourneur, 1994), and dilysine-tagged transmembrane cargo is thereby packaged into COPI(coatomer)-coated vesicles for retrograde transport to the ER (Letourneur et al, 1994).",

These were mapped initially to the \u03b1\u03b2\u2032\u025b-COP subcomplex of coatomer (Cosson and Letourneur, 1994; Lowe and Kreis, 1995; Fiedler et al, 1996; Schr\u00f6der-K\u00f6hne et al, 1998). Subsequent yeast genetic studies implicated the N-terminal \u03b2-propeller domains of \u03b1-COP and \u03b2\u2032-COP, the sequence-related large subunits of \u03b1\u03b2\u2032\u025b-COP (Eugster et al, 2004). A recent structural analysis of the \u03b2\u2032-COP N-terminal domain crystallized with a KxKxx peptide pinpointed the binding site near to the \u2018pore' of the \u03b2-propeller protein, and a corresponding binding site was mapped via functional tests to the pore region of \u03b1-COP (Jackson et al, 2012). However, the mode of KxKxx motif recognition by coatomer was not resolved in this study because the dilysine-binding site on \u03b2\u2032-COP was partially occluded by a crystal contact (Jackson et al, 2012).",

We show that the recognition modes of KKxx and KxKxx motifs are distinct, a non-intuitive observation that helps to rationalize the binding mode of the RKxx motif. We demonstrate that \u03b1-COP and \u03b2\u2032-COP subunits have comparable specificity towards KKxx and KxKxx motifs, contrary to previous reports.

First, the problem of poor solubility of yeast and mammalian \u03b1-COP proteins that hampered previous studies (Lee and Goldberg, 2010) was solved by using the Schizosaccharomyces pombe N-terminal \u03b2-propeller domain, engineered to improve its solubility by mutating five hydrophobic residues to lysine in a flexible loop\u2014L181K, L185K, I192K, L196K and F197K. Second, a fraction of the crystals we obtained had intimate crystal contacts in the vicinity of the dilysine-binding site that occlude all or part of the site. Six crystal structures were discarded for this reason, yielding a final set of eleven structures: eight S. cerevisiae \u03b2\u2032-COP/peptide complexes, two S. pombe \u03b1-COP/peptide complexes and one structure of S. pombe \u03b1-COP with a vacant binding site.

These are the first views of dilysine motifs bound to coatomer unobstructed by crystal contacts, and they define the three \u2018primary' points of interaction between the retrieval motif and coatomer subunit: the C-terminal carboxylate group of the KxKxx peptide binds to a basic patch involving residues Arg15, Lys17 and Arg59 (S. cerevisiae \u03b2\u2032-COP numbering), and the two lysine side chains interact with two acidic patches. These primary interactions can be seen more clearly in Figures 3B and D, which show the crystal structure of \u03b2\u2032-COP bound to the KxKxx motif of human Wbp1 (hWbp1 in Table I; also called OST48). We refer to the acidic patches as patch 1, involving \u03b2\u2032-COP residue Asp206 that binds to the \u22123 lysine side chain, and acidic patch 2, involving residues Asp98 and Asp117 binding to lysine \u22125 of the peptide (labelled accordingly in Figure 3B). In the crystal structure of S. cerevisiae \u03b2\u2032-COP reported by Jackson et al (2012; PDB identifier 2YNN), a KxKxx peptide with sequence CTFKTKTN interacts with the basic patch and with patch 1 via the \u22123 lysine, but patch 2 is occluded by a crystal contact and the \u22125 lysine side chain of the motif projects away from the binding site as a result.",

How certain can we are that this represents the bona fide binding mode for KKxx motifs? First, a comparison of the peptide conformations in the \u03b2\u2032-COP/p25, \u03b1-COP/E19 (Figures 2 and 3) and \u03b2\u2032-COP/yWbp1 (Supplementary Figure S1) complexes shows highly similar conformations and sets of contacts at the binding sites. This involves a total of five distinct crystallographic observations of KKxx peptides, as both the \u03b1-COP/E19 and \u03b2\u2032-COP/yWbp1 crystals contain two complexes in the asymmetric unit (Table I). Second, the peptide conformations were defined by difference Fourier analysis of 1.45 \u00c5 (p25), 1.9 \u00c5 (E19) and 1.5 \u00c5 (yWbp1) resolution X-ray data sets. Third, the KKxx binding mode is common to the \u03b1-COP and \u03b2\u2032-COP binding sites. Fourth, the binding mode is independent of the sequence context, unaffected by a preponderance of hydrophobic (p25; KKLV), hydrophilic (yWbp1; KKTN) or terminal proline (E19; KKMP) residues. On this basis, we conclude that the two dominant classes of dilysine motifs, KKxx and KxKxx, bind to a common site on \u03b1-COP and \u03b2\u2032-COP proteins, as shown previously (Eugster et al, 2004; Jackson et al, 2012), but adopt distinct modes of interaction.",

As expected, both \u03b1-COP and \u03b2\u2032-COP bind to the p25 and adenoviral E19 sequences, in accord with the results of the pull-down experiments, but there is somewhat more variation in the specificity of the two COPs (compared with their highly similar affinities towards KxKxx motifs). The proline-containing E19 motif, KKMP, binds with comparable affinity to \u03b1-COP (Kd=64.5 \u03bcM) and \u03b2\u2032-COP (Kd=49.0 \u03bcM), while the more conventional KKLV sequence of p25 binds somewhat more tightly to \u03b1-COP (Kd=11.3 \u03bcM) than to \u03b2\u2032-COP (Kd=27.7 \u03bcM). The results reinforce the view that \u03b2\u2032-COP does not disfavour KKxx motifs in general. The outlier in this analysis is the dilysine motif of yeast Wbp1 (yWbp1; KKTN), which binds with significantly lower affinity to \u03b2\u2032-COP (Kd=170.9 \u03bcM) than to \u03b1-COP (Kd=36.6 \u03bcM). These measurements are consistent with a previous study showing a 10-fold lower affinity of the KKTN sequence for \u03b2\u2032-COP compared to KxKxx motifs (Jackson et al, 2012). And they offer a possible explanation for the results of trafficking experiments that revealed a selective retrieval defect in coatomer mutants lacking a functional \u03b1-COP dilysine-binding site that presumably are reliant on the \u03b2\u2032-COP subunit for dilysine retrieval. Specifically, the \u03b1-COP mutants were unable to retain a KKTN-tagged reporter molecule in the ER, but were able to maintain the localization of Emp47p, dependent on its KTKLL motif (Schr\u00f6der-K\u00f6hne et al, 1998; Eugster et al, 2004).",

            "text": "In the final stage of our analysis of KKxx motifs, we sought a molecular explanation for this, the difference in specificity of \u03b1-COP and \u03b2\u2032-COP towards the yWbp1 KKTN signal. Presumably, an explanation will be found in the interplay between the terminal residues of the motif KKTN (but not the upstream residues, TFKKTN, since these lie outside the binding site) and specific residue differences between the \u03b1-COP and \u03b2\u2032-COP binding sites. As described previously, the binding sites differ at only two positions, and only one of the two is in the vicinity of the terminal KKTN side chains: namely Tyr33 (\u03b2\u2032-COP) and its equivalent His31 (\u03b1-COP). Supplementary Figure S1A shows the structure of the \u03b2\u2032-COP/yWbp1 complex (the millimolar concentrations of peptide and \u03b2\u2032-COP protein used for crystallization are more than sufficient to saturate the binding site; Kd=170.9 \u03bcM). In the picture, we have overlapped the His31 side chain of \u03b1-COP with Tyr33 of \u03b2\u2032-COP. The juxtaposition of the Tyr33/His31 side chains and the threonine residue of the KKTN motif lead us to propose that an unfavourably close approach of the Tyr33 hydroxyl group impinges on the \u03b2-branched threonine residue (and hinders a favoured side-chain rotamer) and is responsible for lowering the affinity of the \u03b2\u2032-COP/KKTN complex. This invokes a rather subtle interplay, such that the shorter His33 side chain of \u03b1-COP is more compatible with a \u03b2-branched residue at the \u22122 position, all the more so because position 33 is conserved in \u03b1-COP as either a histidine or phenylalanine residue across species (and is a Phe in S. cerevisiae \u03b1-COP). Nevertheless, a peptide in which the threonine residue is replaced with serine, TFKKTN to TFKKSN, was tested for its affinity to \u03b1-COP and \u03b2\u2032-COP by ITC (Supplementary Figure S1B). Strikingly, the KKSN peptide binds more tightly than KKTN to \u03b2\u2032-COP by a factor of 1.8-fold, and a comparison of the (ratio of) affinities of \u03b1-COP and \u03b2\u2032-COP for KKxx motifs shows that the KKTN motif of yWbp1 favours \u03b1-COP by a factor of 4.7, the KKSN motif favours \u03b1-COP by a factor of 2.2, and the KKLV motif of p25 favours \u03b1-COP by a factor of 2.5. The results confirm the interplay between the Tyr33/His31 residue at the binding site and the \u22122 position of the dilysine motif, and they reveal that threonine is disfavoured by \u03b2\u2032-COP at the \u22122 position, hence the reliance of the yWbp1 retrieval motif on a functional \u03b1-COP subunit for trafficking in vivo (Eugster et al, 2004). In our subsequent analysis of the variant KxHxx motif, we found that \u03b2\u2032-COP binds with far lower affinity than \u03b1-COP to the KVHVQ sequence (Figure 4C; peptide PEDVspike in Table I), and the crystal structure of the \u03b2\u2032-COP/KVHVQ complex (Figure 4B) shows the close approach of the \u22122 valine residue to Tyr33. Collectively, these observations are consistent with the proposal that \u03b2\u2032-COP disfavours dilysine motifs that contain a \u03b2-branched residue (I, T, or V) at the \u22122 position.",

For this purpose, we identified conserved KxHxx sequences in the cytoplasmic C termini of the Insig-1 (KPHSD) and Insig-2 (KSHQE) proteins. The Insig proteins are ER localized and facilitate the retention of SCAP/sterol/SREBP complexes in the ER (Yang et al, 2002), but a role for the Insig C terminus in active retrieval of the protein from post-ER membranes has not been considered; we leave this as an open question. ITC measurements showed that the KxHxx motifs of the Insig proteins bind to \u03b1-COP and \u03b2\u2032-COP (Figure 4C). Structures of \u03b2\u2032-COP bound to the Insig-1 and Insig-2 sequences reveal a highly similar binding mode to the KxHxx motif of PEDVspike (Figure 4; Table I). Importantly, the position of the histidine residue is conserved in the three complexes.

Surprisingly, the conformation of the RKxx motif does not mimic KKxx, and we suggest that an arginine residue is slightly too long for optimal binding to acidic patch 1 in the KKxx mode of interaction. Instead, the RKxx motif mimics the KxKxx binding mode from position \u22124 to the C terminus (Figure 5A). The arginine side chain adopts a unique binding position, outside the circumscribed dilysine-binding site (shown schematically in Figure 6). Figure 5B illustrates how the arginine residue is extended to form bonds via its guanidinium group to the backbone carbonyl oxygen atom of \u03b2\u2032-COP residue Arg185. Interestingly, the corresponding carbonyl oxygen atom is not available to form this bond in \u03b1-COP; instead, in all the \u03b1-COP crystal structures the carbonyl group of Arg213 points away from the binding site (\u03c8 angle of Arg213 is rotated \u223c165\u00b0 relative to the conformation in \u03b2\u2032-COP; Figure 5B).",

Binding of the RKxx motif relies on the orientation of the carbonyl group of Arg185 (S. cerevisiae \u03b2\u2032-COP numbering), and this backbone orientation is imposed in turn by the salt bridge between residues Glu184 and Arg163 (Figure 5B). The salt-bridge pairing is highly conserved in \u03b2\u2032-COP sequences: Glu184 is conserved as a glutamic acid, and Arg163 as an arginine, or as lysine in Caenorhabditis species. By contrast, the salt bridge is lost in \u03b1-COP sequences: the position corresponding to \u03b2\u2032-COP Glu184 is highly conserved as an aspartic acid (or threonine in Saccharomyces spp. \u03b1-COP); however, as shown in Figure 5D, the position corresponding to \u03b2\u2032-COP Arg163 changes in \u03b1-COP to a conserved glutamine or glutamic acid residue.",

Additionally, we speculate that aspartic and glutamic acid residues may be favoured at the \u22121 position, to facilitate a charge interaction with Arg272 (\u03b2\u2032-COP numbering), perhaps explaining the tight binding of the hWbp1 KEKSD motif (Figure 3D; Kd[\u03b2\u2032-COP]=3.4 \u03bcM).

The results showed that certain dilysine-containing sequences strongly enforced ER localization (e.g., KKYL and KKTN), whereas others did not (e.g., KKYY, KKTA and KKSP). With hindsight, it seems likely that many of the K(x)Kxx sequences generated in the combinatorial library encode additional trafficking information, such as the C-terminal (di)hydrophobic signal that links to the COPII coat machinery (Nufer et al, 2002; Miller et al, 2003). For example, the screen of Zerangue et al (2001) reported that proline at position \u22121 is strongly disfavoured in a functional retrieval motif, yet the adenoviral E19 KKMP sequence is a bona fide retrieval signal. We tested the affinity of two additional sequences described by Zerangue et al (2001): the KKYL sequence reported as an especially potent retrieval signal binds to both \u03b1-COP and \u03b2\u2032-COP, with comparable affinity to other K(x)Kxx sequences; however, the KKAA motif reported not to function as a retrieval signal does also bind to both COP subunits in our ITC assay (Figure 7B).",

Favouritism towards lysine is also due to the binding modes of the motifs (enforced by interactions with peptide backbone carbonyl groups), which position arginine and histidine side chains suboptimally at the acidic patches. This effect seems to be the most pronounced for KKxx-family motifs, as reporter-based analysis shows that KRxx, KHxx and HKxx motifs are not functional retrieval signals (Jackson et al, 1990); only KKxx and RKxx motifs function as such, and as we have demonstrated RKxx does so by adopting a KxKxx-like binding mode and positioning its arginine side chain beyond the acidic patches.",

            "text": "The major unresolved issue in this context is the functional organization of \u03b1-COP and \u03b2\u2032-COP in the polymerized COPI coat. Our previous structural analysis of \u03b1\u03b2\u2032-COP implicated a triskelion vertex formed by \u03b2-propeller contacts that are highly similar to those in the COPII cage (Stagg et al, 2006; Fath et al, 2007; Lee and Goldberg, 2010). However, as we emphasize in Supplementary Figure S2A, the \u03b1\u03b2\u2032-COP crystal structure included only a fragment of \u03b1-COP so that the location of the \u03b2-propeller domain of \u03b1-COP remains unclear. A direct attack on this problem will require electron microscopy, and a recent study of reconstituted COPI-coated vesicles using cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) has pointed the way forward (Faini et al, 2012). This study identified a three-fold symmetry centre in the density distribution for the COPI cage, consistent with the \u03b1\u03b2\u2032-COP triskelion nucleus. However, fitting of additional solenoid regions of \u03b1\u03b2\u2032-COP and of the AP2 crystal structure (as a model for the \u03b2\u03b4/\u03b3\u03b6-COP subcomplex) was unsatisfactory, and clearer insights into the COPI architecture await an advance in the resolution of the cryo-ET analysis. A key insight from the cryo-ET study is that protein features near to the three-fold symmetry centre reside close to the membrane surface (Faini et al, 2012). This is important, because most dilysine motifs are presented on cytoplasmic tail sequences that are intriguingly short. To assess this issue, we modelled the binding of a dilysine motif to \u03b2\u2032-COP in the \u03b1\u03b2\u2032-COP triskelion on a membrane surface. As Supplementary Figure S2 illustrates, the dilysine motif binds very close to the contact surfaces at the triskelion centre: the KKxx motif fits snugly between adjacent \u03b2\u2032-COP surfaces, whereas the KxKxx motif clashes somewhat with a neighbouring surface (however, we did not evaluate these contacts in detail because the triskelion interface is distorted from proper three-fold symmetry by crystal packing interactions). Importantly, the first lysine residue of the KKxx motif resides \u223c25 \u00c5 from the membrane surface, according to this model (Supplementary Figure S2C). This is just compatible with the lengths of cargo cytoplasmic tails: for example, the number of residues between the membrane surface and the first lysine residue is 13 in yWbp1, 10 in p25 and 12 in adenoviral E19.
