Possible responses can help countries where the infection is still in its infancy not to make the same mistakes.",

Even knowing the world evolution of the pandemic, mobility in Spain remained unchanged until the declaration of the State of Alarm and the entry of citizens from countries severely affected by the pandemic, especially from Italy, was allowed without any restrictions. In addition, the celebration of numerous mass demonstrations was authorized on March 8, on the occasion of Women\u2019s Day, mainly in the city of Madrid, as well as many mass celebrations in the Fallas of Valencia and sports celebrations, which may partially explain the enormous impact that the infection is having in the Capital of Spain, whose figures far exceed those of other cities 14 days after these celebrations (the incubation time for the virus).",

The sad experience suffered in Spain encourages us to communicate this to the rest of the world, so that, as far as possible, they can take measures sufficiently in advance to avoid rapid territorial expansion.",
