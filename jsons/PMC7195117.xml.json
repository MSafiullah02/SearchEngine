The radiological manifestations in disease progression they got were that radiological aggravation of initial image was observed in 65.7% (163/248) of patients on day 7 after onset of symptoms, 94.5% (154/163) of patients showed radiological improvement on day 141, which means that the patients had a typical transition from early stage to advanced stage, and then from advanced stage to dissipating stage. We would like to share the progression of computed tomographic (CT) images in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia in our hospital after hospital discharge. Actually, pulmonary fibrosis may develop early in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia after hospital discharge. However, the older patients with severe illness were more prone to develop fibrosis during treatment.",

Previous study had suggested that the CT findings were various at different stages of COVID-19 infection4\n,\n5. Particularly, more ground-glass opacities and less consolidation were the principal manifestation in the CT images (CT scans before onset of symptoms or CT scans done \u2264 1 week after onset of symptom). Ground-glass opacities were decreased with increasing the stages of COVID-19 pneumonia. However, the consolidation or ground-glass opacities mixed consolidation increased, and reticular was demonstrated in the later stages (scan > 1 week after symptom onset)5. In our present study, the evolution of CT manifestations was familiar to the previous literature.",
