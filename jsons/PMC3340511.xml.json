At the St Louis site, a small number of children without an allergic parent (n = 5) were also recruited for comparison. After enrollment, all subjects were monitored for any episodes of acute respiratory tract illness over the next year along with quarterly assessments of respiratory (and nonrespiratory) tract illness and wheezing by questionnaire. Nasal lavage samples were obtained when a caregiver reported an acute respiratory tract illness and at the time of a 1-year follow-up visit.

Nonadherent cells were removed after 24 hours, and adherent cells were cultured for 5 days with media changes on days 1, 2, and 4 and removal of additional nonadherent cells. At the end of the cell-culture period, the adherent cells were greater than 95% positive for CD68 immunostaining as a marker of monocytic lineage and therefore designated as cord blood monocyte cultures. The approach avoided purification methods (eg, magnetic bead selection or fluorescence-activated cell sorting) that modify the cell membrane or cell-culture methods (eg, growth factor supplementation) that promote full differentiation and polarization and thereby aimed to obtain cells of the monocyte lineage that were representative of naive lung tissue monocytes and macrophages (the target for viral respiratory tract infection in vivo).",

We evaluated whether any of these variables were associated with the outcomes under analysis, and we found only that maternal smoking during the first year of life was related to the pneumonia outcome and the sum of bedroom allergen exposures was related to sinus infections. However, in logistic models controlling for these variables, the odds ratios changed by less than 5% when adjusted, and therefore we present unadjusted relationships here.

In support of this relationship between antiviral response and respiratory tract infection, we show that (1) RSV-driven induction of IFNG mRNA production in cord blood monocytes is variable among infants at birth; (2) decreased levels of RSV-induced IFNG mRNA in cord blood monocytes are associated with a significant increase in the frequency of upper respiratory tract infections, as well as the prevalence of ear infections, sinus infections, pneumonias, and respiratory tract illnesses requiring hospitalization; (3) levels of RSV-induced CCL5 mRNA expression (another highly inducible antiviral system) and interferon-driven activation of STAT1 (the downstream target of the interferon receptors) are not associated with this phenotype for subsequent illness; (4) symptomatic respiratory tract illnesses were frequently associated with detectable levels of respiratory viral pathogens; and (5) levels of RSV-induced IFNG mRNA were not linked to other types of infections, such as croup or stomach flu, which are caused by other types of pathogens. Together, these findings provide for a close relationship between RSV-driven IFNG mRNA production and the development of viral respiratory tract illness and in turn suggest the possibility that a decrease in this type of response might lead to an increase in this type of illness.",

For example, others found that PHA- and allergen-stimulated IFN-\u03b3 production in CBMCs was inversely correlated with the frequency of viral respiratory tract infection in the first year of life.10, 11 However, these studies likely measured the responsiveness of T cells because nonadherent cells were not eliminated and T-cell mitogen and antigen were used for stimulation. Moreover, the effect of viral infection itself was not assessed in these studies. Other studies examined the capacity of PBMCs to produce IFN-\u03b3 during RSV-induced illness in children, but in this case cells were activated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate\u2013ionomycin and cross-linking antibodies to T-cell costimulatory receptors, and the response was localized to CD3+ T cells.20 Similarly, others again made no attempt to purify cells and then stimulated cells with T-cell mitogen and did not separately quantify IFNG mRNA levels.21 The same approach was taken in previous reports of an association between decreased IFN-\u03b3 production from CBMCs and an increased risk of allergic sensitization and recurrent wheezing.12, 22, 23 Here again, this might reflect the focus on T-cell production of IFN-\u03b3 and the proposed role of TH1 versus TH2 cytokines in the development of atopy and asthma.",

Indeed, studies of atopic disease in infancy often focus exclusively on T-cell production of IFN-\u03b3.31 This circumstance is also likely due to the lower levels of IFN-\u03b3 produced by monocytes and macrophages under conditions used in previous studies. Here we are able to measure IFN-\u03b3 production by using a sensitive assay for the corresponding mRNA. Whether this level of interferon production has functional consequences is uncertain, but its utility as a biomarker for susceptibility to viral infection proved quite useful. In contrast, it appears that the monocyte-macrophage lineage is critical for host defense against respiratory tract viruses (including RSV). In particular, lung macrophages are charged with clearance of infected cells without dying themselves, and this protection derives from an antiapoptotic survival function of the chemokine CCL5.25 If this function is lost (eg, in mice that are CCL5 deficient), the host is more susceptible to viral respiratory tract infection. Other work suggests that CCL5 is also needed to direct dendritic cell traffic in the face of viral infection.32 Each of these observations are consistent with those linking CCL5 promoter gene polymorphisms to susceptibility to severe RSV-induced bronchiolitis.33 Nonetheless, we did not find that RSV induction of CCL5 gene expression was significantly associated with viral respiratory tract infection rates in the first year of life. It is still possible, however, that CCL5 production at the level of the lung macrophage would be predictive of susceptibility to infection, especially given the heterogeneity of monocyte-macrophage populations in the circulation and the lung.",

Instead, IFNG gene expression is subject to a distinct type of positive and negative regulation at pretranscriptional, transcriptional, and posttranscriptional levels, at least in the case of lymphoid (NK, NKT, and T) cells.30 However, these regulatory mechanisms have not been studied in monocytes or in response to RSV in any cell type.

Our effort uncovered evidence that the IFNG mRNA monocyte response to virus rather than T-cell response to mitogen/allergen might be linked to the development of viral infections and eventually postviral asthma. We were able to define this relationship despite a relatively small sample size. Sample availability for complex immunologic analysis served to limit the number of URECA participants that could be studied. However, the demographic characteristics of our cohort were no different from those of the overall group, suggesting that we studied a representative sample of subjects. In addition, our study included mostly African American children, and therefore the result might not be generalized to children with other racial backgrounds. Interestingly, others have recently found that interferon-stimulated genes (eg, PYHIN1) are also linked to the development of asthma, particularly in subjects of African descent.36 Our findings are also consistent with observations of decreased IFN-\u03b3 production in response to RSV in PBMCs from older children and adults with allergic asthma.37, 38 Thus these early events in infancy might carry over to a similar deficit in antiviral defense in later life. Together, the findings suggest that a full analysis of interferon production pathways might provide key insights into the susceptibility to viral respiratory tract infection and subsequent chronic obstructive lung diseases, such as asthma.Clinical implicationsIndividual variations in the immune response to respiratory tract viruses are detectable at birth, and these differences predict the susceptibility to acute respiratory tract illness during first year of life.\n",
