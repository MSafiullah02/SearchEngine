EBOV was identified as a human pathogen in 1976 (Bowen et al., 1977, Johnson et al., 1977, Pattyn et al., 1977). The high case-fatality rate and self-limited nature of EVD outbreaks suggest that EVD is a zoonosis (Bausch and Schwarz, 2014, Feldmann and Geisbert, 2011). Detection of anti-EBOV antibodies and EBOV RNA in several fruit bat species from central Africa makes them leading candidates for the animal reservoir (Hayman et al., 2012, Leroy et al., 2005, Ng et al., 2015, Pourrut et al., 2007, Pourrut et al., 2009). Historically, Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreaks have been geographically limited and resolved after at most a few hundred cases (CDC, 2016). In contrast, the epidemic caused by the EBOV Makona variant was much larger: it began in Guinea in 2013 (Baize et al., 2014), spread to Sierra Leone and Liberia in 2014, and infected more than 28,000 people before it was controlled in 2016 (WHO, 2016).",

To date, experiments with EBOV Makona have not detected evidence for increased replication phenotypes. Studies in primates and in immunodeficient mice, for example, failed to detect increased virulence with EBOV Makona compared to EBOV Mayinga, the 1976 reference isolate (Marzi et al., 2015, Smither et al., 2016). Likewise, the EBOV Makona immunomodulatory proteins VP35 and VP24 inhibited interferon signaling to the same extent as the analogous proteins encoded by EBOV from previous outbreaks (Dunham et al., 2015). These studies, however, examined only the early reference EBOV Makona isolate from Kissidougou, Guinea (C-15), and did not address possible changes in the virus over the course of the epidemic.",

As expected for an RNA virus, monitoring over the course of the EVD epidemic revealed mutations throughout the genome of EBOV Makona (Carroll et al., 2015, Gire et al., 2014, Simon-Loriere et al., 2015). However, except for the mucin-like domain in the glycoprotein (GP), which is under diversifying selection by the host humoral immune system, most of the EBOV genome exhibited purifying selection (Park et al., 2015). Although most nonsynonymous mutations detected during the epidemic probably had little effect on viral fitness, it is possible that some of these mutations proliferated because they conferred an advantage to the virus. One such candidate is the clade-defining A82V substitution in EBOV Makona GP, which emerged at a time in the epidemic just before the number of EVD cases increased exponentially. This mutation is particularly intriguing because it is located in the receptor-binding domain of EBOV GP. Here we describe our efforts to determine whether GP-A82V conferred a replication advantage to the virus.",

The second lineage formed a monophyletic clade comprised of 1,403 genomes sampled between March 2014 and August 2015. The second lineage included EBOV from all countries affected by the epidemic and was largely defined by two mutations: a non-synonymous C-to-T substitution at nucleotide 6,283, resulting in the GP-A82V substitution, and a synonymous T-to-C substitution at nucleotide 1,849, which encodes amino acid D460 of the viral NP. In addition to being present in the vast majority of EBOV infections during the 2013\u20132016 epidemic, the GP-A82V mutant was of interest because residue 82 is located at the receptor binding interface (Gong et al., 2016, Wang et al., 2016).",

EBOV GP-pseudotyped lentiviruses were enriched by acceleration through a 25% sucrose cushion, and virion-associated proteins were analyzed by western blotting, using polyclonal antiserum against a V5 epitope tag that was appended to the carboxyl terminus of the GP. GP is cleaved by furin into two components, GP1 and GP2, and our western blot showed two distinct bands. One band was 70 kDa, consistent in size with full-length GP, either uncleaved by furin or GP1+GP2 covalently bound by disulfide linkages (Figure 2D). The second band was 25 kDa, consistent with the furin-processed GP2 product. GP1 + GP2 band intensity was compared to the intensity of the lentivirion capsid core (p24). All GPs showed equivalent levels of incorporation into particles, indicating that the enhanced infectivity observed in human cells with the GP-A82V-containing EBOV GPs was not due to differences in protein synthesis, processing, or GP incorporation into lentiviral particles.",

VP40 is also sufficient for incorporation of EBOV GP into the virion membrane, such that the resulting particles are capable of bona fide receptor-mediated entry into target cell cytoplasm. To facilitate quantitation of EBOV GP-mediated entry, EBOV VP40 fused to \u03b2-lactamase was used to generate VLPs. These VLPs were used to infect target cells, and subsequently target cells were loaded with a fluorogenic substrate that is trapped within the target cell cytoplasm. The substrate can be cleaved only if the GP successfully attaches, binds, and triggers fusion, releasing \u03b2-lactamase-VP40 into the cytoplasm (Manicassamy and Rong, 2009, Tscherne et al., 2010). This experimental system does not require transcription of reporter genes, and therefore more directly tests whether the EBOV GP mutants increase the ability of EBOV VP40 cores to enter into the target cell cytoplasm. \u03b2-lactamase-containing VLPs bearing ancestral or mutant EBOV GPs were incubated with U2OS target cells, and then cells were loaded with the fluorogenic substrate. GP-A82V- or GP-A82V/T230A-bearing particles exhibited a significant increase in entry as compared with the ancestral EBOV GP (Figure 3\n).

Several species harbor amino acid changes in residue 502. Previous studies have shown that a D-to-F substitution at residue 502 disrupts interaction between EBOV GP and NPC1 in straw colored fruit bats (Eidolon helvum) (Ng et al., 2015), and it is likely that similar substitutions would prevent EBOV infection in killer whales (Orcinus orca), pigs (Sus scrofa), Jamaican fruit bats (Artibeus jamaicensis), and possibly the common vampire bat (Desmodus rotundus).",

To test this prediction, we transduced cells from several primate species, as well as carnivores and rodents, with GFP-expressing lentiviral vectors pseudotyped with the EBOV GPs. Indeed, cells from non-human primates were more susceptible to infection by GP-A82V (Figure 4C). In contrast, cells from rodents and carnivores showed no difference in infectivity between the ancestral EBOV GP and GP-A82V. These results demonstrate that GP-A82V provides primate-specific enhancement of infectivity.",

The EBOV GP-A82V mutation is located on the \u03b11 helix that directly interacts with NPC1 loop 2 (Figure 5A), though residue 82 is located on the back side of the helix. In terms of how V82 is likely to affect the viral GP, our modeling suggests that the GP-A82V mutation will have little impact on the \u03b11 helix backbone itself. Rather, the additional alkane branches in the side chain of valine compared to alanine may differentially impact neighboring amino acids such as the arginine at residue 85 (Figures 5B and 5C). R85 extends into a charged pocket present on the opposite side of the \u03b11 helix to where NPC1 interaction occurs and the nitrogens of the terminal guanidinium group are likely to form ionic interactions with the sidechains of E178, Y109, and the backbone hydroxyl group of A76. On the host side, several amino acid differences in the NPC1 loop 2 domain among mammals are likely to impact filovirus susceptibility in a species-specific manner (Wang et al., 2016, Zhao et al., 2016). Specifically, a lysine is found at residue 499 in primates while all other species examined possess a non-polar residue here and several species, including mouse and dog, possess a tyrosine at 504 in place of phenylalanine (Figures 5D and 5E).",

When we added multiple potential confounding factors, including geographic variation in base fatality rate and access to health care, to the model, they had little effect on the conclusion. We found only modest evidence of geographic variation (Figure S1\n), while including the cumulative number of EVD cases per region (a proxy for EVD-associated burdens on the health care infrastructure) failed to improve model fit (Figure S1).

The A82V mutation in EBOV Makona GP arose early during the outbreak, nearly replacing the ancestral genotype, and was present in the viruses responsible for the majority of EVD cases during the epidemic (Figure 1). Our data show that GP-A82V enhances infectivity in human and other primate cells but not in cells of other mammalian species (Figures 2 and4). Given that GP-A82V is located at the NPC1 binding interface, we are left with a strong suspicion that GP-A82V represents an EBOV adaptation to the human host. Human population data reveal a modest trend toward higher viremia with GP-A82V and a significant association with increased mortality (Figure 6), raising the intriguing possibility that these phenotypes result from this mutation.",

Complementary to our findings, they showed that GP-A82V has decreased infectivity for a variety of bat cell lines, species with amino acid substitutions in NPC1 binding loop 2 that are similar to those in the non-primate species tested here (Figures 4 and5).

Emergence of human viral disease from a reservoir host is a major route of virus transmission, as has been documented for human immunodeficiency viruses type 1 and 2 (HIV-1 and HIV-2), severe acute respiratory virus coronavirus (SARS-CoV), influenza virus, dengue virus, Nipah virus, Hendra virus, and Marburg virus (Parrish et al., 2008). Because of shared co-evolutionary history, zoonotic viruses are thought to replicate and transmit more efficiently in their reservoir hosts than in humans. In a new host, although productive infection may occur, differences in key host factors between cells of the reservoir versus those of the new host can impair important events such as receptor binding and entry, replication of the viral genome, virion assembly and release, and avoidance of the host innate or adaptive immune response. More efficient receptor utilization in the new host is a common route of adaptation and has been described for SARS CoV (Li et al., 2005) and numerous influenza strains (Herfst et al., 2012, Imai et al., 2012, Matrosovich et al., 2000, Stevens et al., 2006a, Stevens et al., 2006b, Xu et al., 2010). These experimental findings involving influenza have allowed for more informed surveillance of the animal reservoirs as well as providing a better understanding of the ongoing viral evolution in humans (Dugan et al., 2008, Holmes et al., 2005, Nelson et al., 2008, Obenauer et al., 2006, Rambaut et al., 2008, Russell et al., 2012). The knowledge that EBOV GP mutations that modulate fusion to host cells may be a route for human adaptation, and which GP residues mediate this adaptation is potentially valuable knowledge for surveillance activities during future EBOV epidemics.",

            "text": "The GP-A82V mutation is on the backside of the \u03b11 helix that interacts with NPC1 and is therefore predicted to have little direct impact on binding to NPC1. However, there are likely to be differences in how the alanine and valine side chains pack against neighboring amino acids. Valine contains more alkane branches than alanine, which would place the side chain in closer proximity to GP-R85 and -W86. Steric hindrance between V82 and R85 may alter a predicted salt bridge between R85 and E178 (\u223c2.7 \u00c5 apart, Figure 5). In addition, the added \u201cbulk\u201d of the GP-A82V mutation may alter the \u03b11 helix conformation, to provide better access for proximal resides, such as GP-V79, -P80, -T83, and -W86, to interact with NPC1 (Wang et al., 2016). Compared to the human NPC1 loop 2 domain, the inclusion of hydrophobic side chains at site 499 (valine or isoleucine) in other mammals (non-primates) probably adds more bulk near the backbone, potentially restricting how the loop can adapt to new conformations. Primates also possess a phenylalanine at amino acid 504, while several other species have a tyrosine. Changes between phenylalanine and tyrosine are common, differing only by an ortho hydrogen (phenylalanine) or hydroxyl group (tyrosine) on the benzene ring, and both are generally non-reactive and rarely involved in protein function. F504, however, is predicted to make contact with up to eight residues on EBOV GP (measured by a distance of <4.5 \u00c5 [Wang et al., 2016]) and is potentially a critical site for filovirus susceptibility (Zhao et al., 2016). In addition to the effects the A82V substitution could impart to NPC1/GP interactions, it may also alter the propensity for EBOV GP to undergo \u201ctriggering\u201d upon interaction with NPC1. In this context, the triggering process refers to the dramatic conformational changes undertaken by the EBOV GP resulting in the exposure of the viral fusion peptide on GP2, which is normally sequestered by GP1.",

The GP-A82V mutation was first sampled on March 31, 2014 (Data S1), after only approximately 110 EVD cases (CDC, 2016). Our data show that GP-A82V increases infectivity of EBOV for a variety of human cells in tissue culture and is associated with increased mortality in humans. Although significant questions remain, our findings raise the possibility that this mutation contributed directly to greater transmission and thus to the severity of the outbreak. It is difficult to draw any conclusion about this hypothesis, though, since the frequency increase can also be attributed to stochastic effects, including founder effects as EBOV moved from Guinea into Sierra Leone and multiple re-introductions of GP-A82V back into Guinea. In any case, the early emergence of GP-A82V highlights the need for vigorous surveillance and rapid public health intervention after identification of EVD and other emerging infectious diseases, in order to limit the possibility of viral adaptation to humans. Finally, studies such as this are necessary, as they provide vital biological information crucial for the interpretation of viral sequence evolution. Having this connection between viral genotype and phenotype maximizes the utility of viral sequencing efforts during outbreaks, allowing more efficient targeting of intervention strategies.",

The V5-tagged constructs did indeed have the same phenotype as the untagged constructs (data not shown). 48 hr after media change, viral supernatant was harvested, passed through a 0.45\u03bcm filter, and layered over a 25% sucrose cushion. Virus was pelleted through the sucrose cushion by spinning at 125,000 x g using SW55Ti buckets in an Optima XE-90 ultracentrifuge (Beckman Coulter, Indianapolis, IN). Supernatant was removed and viral pellets were gently washed with 1 mL ice cold PBS. Virus was then lysed in Hypotonic Lysis Buffer: 20 mM TRIS-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM EDTA, 0.5% NP-40, 0.1% Triton X-100, and cOmplete mini protease inhibitor (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). Concomitantly, transfected cells were washed once with ice cold PBS and lysed in Hypotonic Lysis Buffer for 20 min on ice and clarified by centrifugation at 16,000 x g for 20 min at 4\u00b0C. Cell lysate supernatant was transferred to new tubes and insoluble pellets were discarded. In preparation for SDS-PAGE fractionation, viral and cellular lysates were mixed 1:1 with 2x Laemmli buffer containing 355 mM 2-mercaptoethanol and boiled for 5 min.",
