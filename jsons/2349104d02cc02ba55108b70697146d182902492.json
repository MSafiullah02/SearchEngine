In the studies that investigated physical activity or BMI as outcomes, 40 exposures included participants' assessments of built environmental features such as traffic, 41 presence of sidewalks, street lighting at night, distance to destinations and perceived safety. 42 Several studies in the review found light traffic, sidewalks and safety from crime were associated 43 with physical activity. One study found higher BMI among individuals who reported barriers to attributes associated with physical activity, measured using self-report and objective data 67 (accelerometry). Physical activity was associated with self-efficacy but not with subjective associated with travel time to the utilized grocery store. Bypassing grocery stores nearer to home 75 resulted in longer travel time or distance, both of which were associated with higher BMI. ( The inter-rater reliability (IRR) estimates are presented in Table 2 . Estimates were highest for 307 street type, pedestrian and bicycle street features, walkability, amenities, and transit features, and 308 were lowest for public communal/recreation space and PA venue. Results of the linear regressions predicting BMI, walking and MVPA are presented in Table 4 .",

Recently, Smith (2017) reviewed studies of the built 25 environment and self-reported or objectively measured physical activity (PA), finding 26 associations between activity and features such as walkability, presence of parks and 27 infrastructure supportive of active transport. Few of the studies reviewed considered 28 socioeconomic status or race-ethnicity, though two such studies found some evidence that 29 disadvantaged individuals were less likely to use improved parks and new walking and cycling 30 paths (Smith et al. 2017). Lovasi (2009) reviewed studies of the built environment, obesity, and 31 obesity-related health behaviors among individuals of low socioeconomic status, black race, or 32 Hispanic ethnicity. In the studies reviewed, subjective and objective assessments of the built 33 environment included features such as presence of fast food restaurants, walkability, and 34 environmental disorder. Findings across studies were somewhat inconsistent, though several 35 environmental characteristics appear more likely to improve obesity among disadvantaged 36 populations, namely, access to healthy foods and places to exercise, and perceived safety. 37 (Lovasi et al. 2009) Casagrande et al.

(Casagrande et al. 2009) Several recent natural experiments have examined how changes to the built environment 46 influence health focusing specifically on African American adults and low-income racial and ethnic minorities. A longitudinal assessment of the built environment, physical activity, BMI and 48 neighborhood satisfaction was conducted in two low-income, African American communities in 49 Pittsburgh, PA, USA, which are the primary focus of this study (Dubowitz et al. 2019). A natural 50 experimental design was used to track participants' activity, BMI, and neighborhood satisfaction 51 before and after one of the neighborhoods received investments that improved the built 52 environment, such as new residential buildings, sidewalks, and street crossings. However, 53 physical activity and BMI were not found to be significantly different between participants living 54 in the intervention and comparison neighborhoods. Gustat (2012) conducted a natural experiment 55 in a low-income, African American neighborhood in New Orleans, Louisiana, USA. A walking 56 path and a new school playground designed to increase physical activity were installed in one 57 neighborhood. Before and after the installation, self-reported physical activity of adult household 58 members and observed physical activity were collected in the intervention neighborhood and two 59 comparison neighborhoods. Observed activity increased in the intervention neighborhood and 60 decreased in the comparison neighborhoods after the improvements were made. This finding was 61 consistent with the theory that improvements in the built environment in a specific location 62 would impact activity in the neighborhood overall. (Gustat et al. 2012) 63 Two recent observational studies evaluated multiple measures of the built and social 64 environment in disadvantaged urban neighborhoods. A study of African American adults and 65 older adults living in urban areas of Detroit, MI, (Gothe 2018) investigated social and physical66",

(Dubowitz et al. 183 2019; Dubowitz et al. 2015) This study utilizes data collected in 2013 and 2016, when 184 accelerometer data were collected. Participants included in this study had baseline (2013) and 185 follow-up (2016) interview data, were living in the Hill District or Homewood neighborhood in 186 2016, and had valid GigaPan\u00ae image data for street segments near their homes (environment sample consisted of a random sample of 614 street segments, identified 191 from ESRI and local government shapefiles, representing 25% of the street segments in the Hill 192 District and Homewood neighborhoods. A street segment was defined as a block-face, from 193 intersection to intersection. Street-level observations were conducted during the fall season in 194 2015 with GigaPan\u00ae technology. Trained observers in Pittsburgh obtained images of street 195 environments using a protocol that involved setting up the GigaPan\u00ae apparatus on a tripod, 196 aiming the camera to select the corners of the panoramic photo and initiating the GigaPan\u00ae to 197 take the photographs. Photos were taken at the midpoint of each street block. Street segment data 198 were collected prior to the follow-up in-home participant survey. Trained staff in Pittsburgh used 199 software provided by GigaPan\u00ae to electronically stitch individual images together to create 200 high-resolution panoramic images of the street environments. Many of the data collectors and some members of the study team in Pittsburgh were residents of the neighborhoods studied 202 (Dubowitz et al. 2015). GigaPan\u00ae images were obtained for 590 of the street segments. 203 The stitched images were transferred via a secure server to our remote research team for 204 auditing. Trained coders audited the images for environmental attributes including land use, 205 traffic and pedestrian features, amenities and litter using a modified version of the Bridging the 206 Gap (BTG) Street Segment Observation Form (Zenk 2015). Coders' training included reading a 207 manual with detailed information on the audit form, participating in group discussions, and 208 receiving instruction in navigating GigaPan\u00ae imagery and using a digital version of the BTG 209 form. All coders achieved at least 80% reliability on a test sample of street segments. (Twardzik 210 et al. 2018) A total of 109 GigaPan\u00ae images were excluded from this study due to problems 211 such as a mismatch between the GigaPan\u00ae image and GSV image, poor image quality, or 212 problems with the image file, resulting in an analysis sample of 481 street segments (Hill District 213 n=177, Homewood n=304). A random sample 24% of the GigaPan\u00ae audits (n=115) were double 214 coded to create a set of data appropriate for estimating inter-rater reliability. Participant characteristics, BMI, walking and MVPA 219 Participant characteristics including age, sex, race, and residential neighborhood were collected 220 during in-person interviews conducted by trained staff in Pittsburgh. Signed informed consent 221 was obtained by the interviewer at the time of the interview. Race was recoded as Black or Other 222 (Other includes Asian, multi-racial, White and other race). Data on body mass index (BMI), Objectively measured BMI was estimated from interviewer-measured height and weight 225 collected by trained staff during the baseline and follow-up interviews. Walking was determined 226 from a survey item that asked participants, \"In the past month, how often did you walk to places 227 in the neighborhood?\" with responses coded on a six-point ordinal scale ranging from 0 (never) 228 to 5 (at least once a day). MVPA was obtained from tri-axial Actigraph GT3X+ accelerometers 229 worn on the non-dominant wrist for seven consecutive days (24 hours per day). The data were 230 transferred from GT3X format to raw CSV format and were processed during 2016 and 2017 231 using the GGIR v. 1.5-2 package in R v. 3.3.3 to obtain MVPA in minutes per day (Richardson 232 et al. 2017; van Hees et al. 2019; van Hees et al. 2014; van Hees et al. 2015). The average 233 MVPA per day was estimated from daily MVPA for participants with at least four days of valid 234 wear time (accelerometer was worn for at least ten hours per day). conducting environmental audits evaluated 54 environmental attributes for each 238 street segment sampled in the neighborhood on topics including land use type, traffic and 239 pedestrian features, safety signs, amenities, and litter. Some attributes, such as light rail, did not 240 appear in any of the audited images and were excluded. Conceptually similar items were 241 combined by averaging or summing to create 12 summary measures. Two environmental 242 features -street type and slope -were retained as individual items, resulting in a total of 14 243 street segment measures. Details on the coding and construction of these measures are provided 244 in Appendix Table 1. For each participant, a 0.4 kilometer (0.25 mile) road network buffer was 245 created using the participant address as the centroid of the buffer (Richardson et al. 2017). The 246 use of a 0.4 km radial buffer around the residential address is supported by prior research. Specifically, McMillan (2010) tested street segment sampling protocols in low income urban 248 areas with relatively higher minority populations finding that sampling 25% of street segments in 249 a 0.4 km radial buffer provided an adequate representation of the residential walking 250 environment (McMillan et al. 2010). In addition, a recent review of studies of the built 251 environment and physical activity found that 0.4 to 0.5 km radial buffers were most commonly 252 used (Barnett et al. 2017). 253 Each of the 14 street segment measures described above were summarized at the 254 participant level to create 14 environmental exposure variables for use in further analysis, as 255 follows. For each street segment within a participant buffer, each of the 14 street segment 256 measures was weighted by the length of the segment divided by the total length of all street 257 segments in the buffer. The 14 weighted measures were averaged across all segments in a buffer 258 to construct 14 participant-level measures of environmental exposures. Thus, for each exposure 259 (e.g., presence of a traffic light), the values for all sampled streets within a participant's buffer 260 were combined into a single value for the participant. Factor analysis was then used to reduce the 261 14 environmental exposures to three variables which were defined, based on item content, as 262 factor 1, pedestrian-bicycle-amenities; factor 2, hilly-vacant-boarded; factor 3, PA-recreation 263 (full details in result section). 264 The factor analysis was conducted using all available data for the sample of participants 265 who were living in the Hill District or Homewood neighborhood in 2016 and who had GigaPan\u00ae 266 audit data for street segments in their residential buffer (n = 731). Participants with GigaPan\u00ae 267 audit data for less than 10% of the total street length in the buffer were excluded (n=41), 268 resulting in an analysis sample of 690 participants (Hill District n = 476, Homewood n = 214).269 The average proportion of GigaPan\u00ae audited street length ranged from 0.in the inter-rater reliability (IRR) analysis were obtained for a random sample of 277 115 double-coded street segments audited by two raters. Inter-rater reliability was estimated for 278 the 14 street segment level measures (12 summary measures and two individual items). Inter-279 rater reliability was estimated for continuous measures using intra-class correlations (ICCs) from 280 two-way analysis of variance with mixed effects (Shrout and Fleiss 1979). Cohen's kappa (\u03ba) 281 was used to estimate inter-rater reliability for categorical items (Landis and Koch 1977).282 283 2.3.2. Participant level environmental exposures: factor analysis 284 The 14 participant-level environmental exposures were included in an exploratory factor analysis 285 as a data reduction step. Factor analysis provides a way to summarize environmental exposures 286 across a set of correlated measures and produces a smaller number of variables representing 287 interrelated items. The principal factor method and orthogonal rotation were used. Predicted 288 scores for factors with eigenvalues greater than one were estimated to obtain participant-level 289 environmental exposure factors for use in regression analysis.",

The pedestrian-bicycle-amenities factor captured features such as 370 sidewalks, curbs, marked crossings, stop signs at pedestrian crossings, and amenities such as 371 benches at transit stops. In comparison, prior studies of disadvantaged neighborhoods found 372 perceived barriers to physical activity associated with higher BMI (Casagrande et al. 2009), as 373well as no association between infrastructure supportive of activity and BMI(Tung et al. 2016).374    Those studies reported associations between subjective assessments or macro-scale data on 375 distance to a nearby resource, whereas our study used micro-scale audits of environmental376 features. Dubowitz (2019) found no significant difference in BMI between residents in the Hill 377 and Homewood neighborhoods, though unlike our study that analysis did not include micro-scale 378 data on the environment (Dubowitz et al. 2019). 379 Participants in this study who value healthy lifestyles may have chosen to live in areas 380 that support their desire to live a healthy lifestyle, which could explain in part the finding of 381 lower BMI. Numerous studies have discussed and examined whether self-selection bias drives 382 the relationship between the built environment, health and health-related behavior, such as BMI 383 and physical activity (Cao et al. 2009; Diez Roux 2004; McCormack and Shiell 2011). This spurious association could arise when people who value healthy lifestyles chose to live in areas 385 with environments supportive of such lifestyle. Studies that have examined the degree to which 386 self-selection explains the association between the built environment and behavior have had 387 mixed results, though most studies find little to modest effects of self-selection (Cao et al. 2009; 388 Frank et al. 2007; Sallis et al. 2009). A review of studies that utilized designs that help address 389 self-selection suggested a mix of associations in the expected direction and null associations 390 (McCormack and Shiell 2011). Our study utilized a longitudinal design to examine the 391 association of the built environment on change in physical activity and BMI over time, which is 392 an advance over the large body of cross-sectional studies exploring this relationship in the 393 literature (Haselwandter et al. 2015; Papas et al. 2007). Furthermore, our population was 394 sampled from two low-income communities. It is speculated that self-selection bias could be less 395 in low-income communities where people may not have the luxury of choosing neighborhoods 396 specifically for environments supportive of healthy lifestyles (Wang and Cao 2017; Zang et al. 397 2019). However, self-selection can still result in bias in this case. This can occur if low-income 398 persons choose neighborhoods based on specific characteristics that are associated with 399 environments not supportive of health, such as low housing costs, and if low-income is 400 associated with the outcome of interest (Boone-Heinonen et al. 2011). Thus, while our 401 longitudinal design and study population make it less likely that the results are due to self-402 selection bias, this possibility cannot be ruled out. 403 A model predicting walking as a continuous variable did not show significant 404 associations with the environmental exposure factors. Dubowitz (2019) also found no difference 405 in walking behavior between the Hill and Homewood populations though, as noted earlier, that 406 analysis did not include micro-scale built environment data (Dubowitz et al. 2019). In a complementary analysis, we found that a dichotomous measure of frequent walking was 408 negatively associated with the PA-recreation factor. This finding conflicts with recent studies 409 that have shown positive effects of recreational facilities on all types of walking. For instance, 410 self-reported presence of recreational facilities was associated with self-reported walking in a 411 sample of adults (Nehme et al. 2016), walking was associated with green and open recreation 412 space in a study of older adults (Li et al. 2005), and observed activity increased in a low-income 413 neighborhood after a school playground and walking path were installed though it is not clear 414 from that study whether the activity was primarily walking or included other types of physical 415 activity (Gustat et al. 2012). In contrast, a recent review study found mixed results for 416 associations between walking, recreation facilities, parks and green space (Yun 2019). The PA-417 recreation factor in this study reflected areas with more physical activity venues (parks, playing 418 courts, school grounds, community centers, fitness facilities) and fewer types and lower density 419 of housing, and the study participants lived in disadvantaged neighborhoods, which could 420 explain in part differences in findings. Notably, the street segments sampled for this study had 421 very few physical activity and recreation land uses, and the PA-recreation factor had low inter-422 rater reliability possibly due to the low density of these land use types. The low density of these 423 features in the two neighborhoods and low reliability of the measure may have resulted in a 424 spurious finding. In addition, walking in the Hill District and Homewood neighborhoods may not 425 be associated with recreation facilities, especially if residents walk for transportation rather than 426 fitness or recreation (Spinney et al. 2012). The question utilized in this study did not differentiate 427 walking for transport and walking for leisure. Walking for transportation would be likely to 428 occur in areas with more housing (Sallis et al. 2009). Yet the PA-recreation factor had a negative loading on type and density of housing, indicating a lack of housing in areas with more public, 430 open, and recreational land uses, and this could have affected the association. 431 The environmental exposures were not significant in models predicting continuous or 432 dichotomized MVPA. This result may be explained in part by the very low level of MVPA 433 observed in this sample both at baseline and follow-up (Dubowitz et al. 2019). The MVPA 434 measure may not have captured the type of physical activity that would likely occur within the 435 0.4 km network residential buffer near the home. Prior studies of residents of the Hill District 436 and Homewood neighborhoods found no difference in MVPA in a comparison of the 437 neighborhoods (Dubowitz et al. 2019), and no association between MVPA and walkability from 438 in-person audit data, GIS-based green space and MVPA, though an association was found 439 between walkability and MVPA in an analysis of women only (Richardson et al. 2017). 440 The environmental exposure related to the hilliness of the area, presence of vacant lots 441 and vacant/boarded buildings was not associated with any of the health outcomes. Although the 442 presence of vacant lots and vacant/boarded buildings might be associated with perceived safety 443 or crime, we did not include crime and safety in this study. Other studies have found associations 444 between physical activity, perceived safety and crime (Casagrande et al. 2009; Gothe 2018; 445 Lovasi et al. 2009). More research is needed to investigate possible associations between the 446 presence of vacant lots and vacant/boarded buildings captured in micro-scale environmental 447 audits, perceptions of safety, crime, and health outcomes.448 Prior studies established the reliability and validity of built environment measures from 449 GigaPan\u00ae images in comparison with GSV and direct observation (Nelson et al. 2019; Twardzik 450 et al. 2018). This study further validates the use of GigaPan\u00ae in studies of the built environment 451 and health by establishing predictive validity from the association between BMI and exposure to features in the environment that support walking and cycling, GigaPan\u00ae images can be retained 453 and used for comparison with the same environments studied at a later point in time, thus 454 GigaPan\u00ae technology may be useful for urban planning and policy making purposes, especially 455 when micro-scale, time-sensitive data on the built environment are desired. 456 Limitations and strengths 457 Strengths of this study include a strong recruitment process and high recruitment rate for 458 a population-based study in a low-income neighborhood (Dubowitz et al. 2015). Recruitment 459 was likely facilitated by utilizing community members as part of the study team. Furthermore, 460 those enrolled were generally demographically representative of the community. For example, 461 based on Census data, the percentage of residents in the community who self-defined as black 462",

Further, although the recruitment was high and the sample generally 470 demographically representative of the community, the sample was slightly older than the 471 community population, more likely to be female and less likely to have children. This is likely 472 due to several reasons. The primary food shopper was selected for inclusion in the main study, 473 likely resulting in a sample of mostly female, older respondents (Dubowitz et al. 2015). Another 474 limitation is that this study sampled adults and street segments in two low-income neighborhoods in the same city. Other studies of the built environment and health in disadvantaged individuals 476 in the U.S. have included more diverse samples from several cities (Casagrande et al. 2009; 477 Lovasi et al. 2009). Finally, although the audit tool was both detailed and comprehensive, some 478 social environment exposures were not included, such as crime and perceived safety, which have 479 been shown to negatively influence physical activity (Casagrande et al. 2009; Lovasi et al. was demonstrated for an environmental exposure measure derived from 484 GigaPan\u00ae imagery that captured features supportive of walking and cycling in a longitudinal 485 model predicting BMI.

            "text": "Tung et al. 2016)Across these studies that focused on disadvantaged populations, patterns of associations between physical activity, BMI and the built environment emerge, though findings are inconsistent in part because the studies used different study designs and approaches to measure the built environment. The studies identify benefits of health promoting neighborhood features on health and provide information about how residents of disadvantaged neighborhoods use and interact with their environments in ways that can affect health. Overall, the presence of infrastructure supportive of active transport, places to exercise and perceived safety were associated with physical activity while perceived barriers to activity and longer distances or travel time to access healthy food were associated with higher BMI.Measuring the Built EnvironmentStudies of the built environment have used various methods to obtain data on physical features and attributes that are linked to health-related behaviors and health outcomes. Microscale audits of the street environment have been conducted using Google Street View (GSV) and direct observation to collect data on the presence of sidewalks, aesthetic features such as gardens, and signs of neighborhood disorder (Bader et al. 2015; Badland et al. 2010; Rzotkiewicz et al. 2018). Spatial databases with macro-scale data such as land use, often manipulated within a geographic information system (GIS), are another common and important source of built environment data (Brownson et al. 2009). Subjective assessments of environmental conditions by study participants have also been used, for instance to capture features related to perceived walkability (Hajna et al. 2013; Nehme et al. 2016). Each audit method has advantages and disadvantages. Google Street View (GSV) is a publicly-available source of environmental data that includes micro-scale features (Steinmetz-Wood et al. 2019). GSV is popular in studies of the built environment (Nguyen et al. 2019) and 100 has established reliability and validity (Badland et al. 2010; Griew et al. 2013). Yet GSV images 101 may not be time-sensitive, image quality can vary across locations (Rzotkiewicz et al. 2018), and 102 imagery from different dates may be combined in GSV representations of places (Curtis et al. 2013). Direct observation provides objective assessments of neighborhood environments but requires coding environmental features in person at the time of observation which is costly 105 (Bader et al. 2015). And inter-rater reliability for direct observation requires that two or more individuals evaluate the same environments contemporaneously. Macro-scale data such as from This study used GigaPan\u00ae technology to obtain images of the built environment. GigaPan\u00ae is a robotic system that stitches together numerous high-resolution images derived 116 from a camera housed within the GigaPan\u00ae apparatus to create highly detailed, navigable, panoramic images (http://gigapan.com). GigaPan\u00ae offers several advantages as compared to other audit methods. The contextual information and high-resolution detail captured with GigaPan\u00ae technology are relevant in studies of the built environment. Images can be coded, and inter-rater reliability can be estimated as time permits, providing flexibility to collect timesensitive data. Although GigaPan\u00ae technology requires taking photographs in the study setting, it provides an alternative to direct observation and GSV for capturing high-resolution, timesensitive environmental imagery. Research to validate new audit technologies such as GigaPan\u00ae 124 for use in studies of the built environment is needed (Badland et al. 2010).The purpose of this study was to determine whether neighborhood environmental 126 exposures were associated with physical activity and BMI in a longitudinal sample of disadvantaged, mostly African American adults in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA.
