Furthermore, the rapid transmission of SARS CoV2 resulted in implementation of methods to assess, mitigate and contain the resulting COVID-19 disease that were based on limited knowledge of its epidemiology. Given potentially insufficient testing supplies, but the need to rapidly identify cases, access to testing was based on symptoms typical of an acute respiratory infection, such as cough, fever, and shortness of breath, as has been reported to be emblematic of COVID-19 infection. 1 A previous report noted that use of cough, fever, shortness of breath and sore throat as the sole screening criteria for COVID-19 infection among health care personnel might have missed 17% of symptomatic cases. 2 Gastrointestinal and non-acute respiratory illness-typical symptoms have been noted. 1 Outpatient symptom complexes may differ from the better-known inpatient set. A data-driven set of clinical indicators for COVID-19 would help to identify outpatient symptoms and those who most benefit from limited testing availability.",
