Potential pathogenic microbial flora of the respiratory tract and of the vestibulum nasi, such as methicillin-sensible (MSSA) or resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), is correlated with a higher risk of contamination of surrounding surfaces through direct or indirect contact with hands [81] . Intestinal infections caused i.e. by Clostridium difficile and Norovirus, or enteral colonization with nosocomial pathogens such as vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) may also be associated with a risk of widespread environmental contamination [30] . Compared with the large number of published literature on environmental contamination with MRSA, VRE, and C. difficile, there are relatively few published studies on environmental contamination by Gram-negative bacteria [64, 65] . Aside of a possible publication bias in the past, one reason for this is the different ability of Grampositive and Gram-negative bacteria to survive in the inanimate environment. The level of microbial bio-burden on surface in healthcare settings is low compared to the numbers on patients' skin or in faeces. However, even at low particle numbers there is a risk of transmission (Table 2 .1). In immuno-compromised patients, the required numbers of microorganisms for causing infectious diseases is even lower, increasing the risk of HAI in these populations. Inanimate surfaces have been described as source for HAI-outbreaks. Hayden et al. [49] demonstrated that touching the environment contaminated with relatively low pathogen concentrations in a room occupied by a patient colonized with VRE is associated with approximately the same risk of VRE acquisition on hands as touching an affected patient directly. Evidence of the importance of environmental transmission is further provided by studies showing an increased risk of infection in patients admitted to the same rooms previously occupied by other infected/colonised cases. This has been shown for C. difficile [101] , VRE and MRSA ( [54, 55] , and also own observations).

Adhesion triggers the expression of a sigma factor that depresses a large number of genes so that bacteria within the biofilm are at least 500 times more tolerable against antimicrobial agents [23] as well as against physical cold plasma [71, 72] . The reason for the unspecific increased tolerance is the production of extracellular substances like polysaccharides, proteins and DNA after attachment to surfaces. A precondition for biofilm formation is the presence of certain amounts of humidity. The biofilm matrix restrains water and nutrients and protects the microorganisms against environmental influences [28, 39] . Because of that, once formed biofilms are an important factor of persistence of microorganisms on surfaces in nature as well as in industrial or medical areas [22, 29, 12] . The persistence on inanimate surfaces is prolonged and depends of the environmental conditions, especially the humidity. Also on hospital surfaces biofilms were demonstrated on a number of objects and surfaces, such as sterile supply buckets, opaque plastic doors, venetian blind cords, and sink rubbers, and it was possible to cultivate viable bacteria. Currently, there is not enough research to elucidate whether presence or absence of biofilm affect the risk of transmission or possibility for crosstransmission. However, multi-drug resistant bacteria may not only be protected within biofilms, which may be the mechanism why they persist within the hospital environment [114] , but may also exchange virulence factors among their own species or to other species present in biofilms as well [29, 43, 109 ].", "cite_spans": [{"start": 288, "end": 292, "text": "[23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 333, "end": 337, "text": "[71,", "ref_id": "BIBREF70"}, {"start": 338, "end": 341, "text": "72]", "ref_id": "BIBREF71"}, {"start": 708, "end": 712, "text": "[28,", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 713, "end": 716, "text": "39]", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 878, "end": 882, "text": "[22,", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 883, "end": 886, "text": "29,", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 887, "end": 890, "text": "12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1568, "end": 1573, "text": "[114]", "ref_id": "BIBREF113"}, {"start": 1688, "end": 1692, "text": "[29,", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 1693, "end": 1696, "text": "43,", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 1697, "end": 1700, "text": "109", "ref_id": "BIBREF108"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Biofilm"}, {"text": "A number of other factors may influence the survival of microorganisms on surfaces.

Due to the overwhelming evidence of low compliance of hand disinfection, the risk from contaminated surfaces cannot be overlooked and must not be down played by hospital administrations. During outbreaks, the role of the patients' environment is particularly evident, as suggested by observed evidence for Acinetobacter baumannii, C. difficile, MRSA, P. aeruginosa, VRE, Adenovirus, SARS virus, Rotavirus, and Norovirus [64, 65, 54, 55, 99, 9, 123, 83, 58] . The role of contaminated surfaces is also underlined by the observation that after environmental disinfection, significant decrease of transmissions and HAI have been shown, i.e. for C. difficile [73, 126] , for VRE [50] , for MRSA [32] , for multidrug-resistant A. baumanii [84] , for S. marcescens [3] , and for other multidrug-resistant Gram-negative rods [86] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 155, "end": 159, "text": "[91]", "ref_id": "BIBREF90"}, {"start": 270, "end": 274, "text": "[94]", "ref_id": "BIBREF93"}, {"start": 844, "end": 848, "text": "[64,", "ref_id": "BIBREF63"}, {"start": 849, "end": 852, "text": "65,", "ref_id": "BIBREF64"}, {"start": 853, "end": 856, "text": "54,", "ref_id": "BIBREF53"}, {"start": 857, "end": 860, "text": "55,", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}, {"start": 861, "end": 864, "text": "99,", "ref_id": "BIBREF98"}, {"start": 865, "end": 867, "text": "9,", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 868, "end": 872, "text": "123,", "ref_id": "BIBREF122"}, {"start": 873, "end": 876, "text": "83,", "ref_id": "BIBREF82"}, {"start": 877, "end": 880, "text": "58]", "ref_id": "BIBREF57"}, {"start": 1079, "end": 1083, "text": "[73,", "ref_id": "BIBREF72"}, {"start": 1084, "end": 1088, "text": "126]", "ref_id": "BIBREF125"}, {"start": 1099, "end": 1103, "text": "[50]", "ref_id": "BIBREF49"}, {"start": 1115, "end": 1119, "text": "[32]", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 1158, "end": 1162, "text": "[84]", "ref_id": "BIBREF83"}, {"start": 1183, "end": 1186, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1242, "end": 1246, "text": "[86]", "ref_id": "BIBREF85"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Mechanisms of Transmission from Inanimate Surfaces to Susceptible Patients and Consequences Thereof"}, {"text": "If performed correctly, also the burden of microbial airborne transmission can be significantly decreased by surface disinfection.
