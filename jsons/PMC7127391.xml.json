            "text": "A number of spectral methods have been developed for quantification of total flavonoids and DMY. The complexation of flavonoids with Al(III) is the principle of spectrophotometric assays used for quantification of total flavonoids (Naczk & Shahidi, 2006). Simple flavonoids normally have maximal absorption between 220 and 300 nm (Owades, Rubin, & Brenner, 1958). The maximal absorption of DMY was observed at ~290 nm. The role of its C2\u2013C3 double bond, whose presence was responsible for the absorption bands in the ultraviolet (UV) regions (Biler, Biedermann, Valentova, Kren, & Kubala, 2017). The UV absorption was also affected by the nature of solvent employed and the pH of the solution. High pH (above 11 for DMY) induced the formation of a long-wavelength peak arising from double and/or triple deprotonation (Biler et al., 2017). Moreover, there was a possibility of interference by UV-absorbing substances such as proteins, nucleic acids and amino acids. Another spectral method Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) has been used for structural elucidation of complex flavonoids isolated from natural resources (Jeon, Chun, Choi, & Kwon, 2008; Wang, Xiong, & Perumalla, 2016). FT-IR has been applied to analyze the isolated compound DMY from the bark of Salix hulteni. In a recent paper reported by Wang, Xiong, and Perumalla (2016), FT-IR has been used for quickly distinguishing homochiral (+)DMY from racemic (+/\u2212)DMY extracted from A. grossedentata leaves. The physicochemical properties of the two phases were also assessed using FT-IR. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and mass spectrometry (MS) are also used for elucidating the chemical structures of flavonoids. Standard 1H, 13C NMR spectra can give a wealth of chemical information for identifying flavonoids. MS analysis is based on ionizing chemical species and sorting the ions based on their mass-to-charge ratios (Ignat et al., 2011). By using 1H and 13C NMR and MS, purity and steric integrity of DMY were assessed (Outtrup, Schaumburg, & Madsen, 1985). Recently, the active compound was identified as 2R, 3R-dihydromyricetin from pine needles of Cedrus deodara based on MS and NMR data (Liang, Wu, Qiu, Zhong, & Gao, 2014).",

HSCCC is an all-liquid chromatographic technique very suitable for preparative isolation of pure compounds (Ignat et al., 2011). Recently, HSCCC was successfully used for rapid and efficient separation of antioxidants including DMY from vine tea (A. grossedentata) (Gao et al., 2017; Ma et al., 2017). Furthermore, Purification of (+)-DMY from an extract of A. grossedentata leaves was performed using a triple-column HSCCC. With a solvent system composed of n-hexane-ethyl acetate-methanol-water (1:3:2:4, v/v) 11.3 g of (+)-DMY was obtained at a high purity of over 99% (Du et al., 2002). HPCCC is based on a support-free liquid\u2013liquid centrifugal partition chromatography, which could be applied to the fast fractionation and recovery of flavonoid from plant extract. A developed HPCCC protocol was successfully used to isolate the main flavonoids including DMY from the crude extract of Impatiens glandulifera Royles (Vieira, Winterhalter, & Jerz, 2016).",

Oxidative damage induced by these free radicals can create deleterious effects on cells and tissues and may cause several biochemical problems including protein aggregation, DNA degradation, and oxidation of membrane lipids (Park, Chong, & Mi, 2016). Flavonoids are one of the most powerful scavengers of harmful free radicals (Burda & Oleszek, 2001). DMY has been shown to be a strong antioxidant agent both in vitro and in vivo (Table 1\n). DMY inhibited the increase of lipid peroxidation (LPO) in a concentration dependent manner in linoleic acid system (Zhang, Ning, Yang, & Wu, 2003). Gao, Liu, and Ning (2009) observed that antioxidant activity of flavonoid-rich extracts (DMY) from A. grossedentata leaves were comparable with that of tertiary butylhydroquinone (TBHQ) in a linoleic acid system. The antioxidant activity of DMY was also confirmed in lard oil (Zhao et al., 2009), soybean oil (Ye, Wang, Duncan, Eigel, & O\u2019Keefe, 2015), sausage (Wang, Qin, Yang, Lu, & Qin, 2017) and cooked ground beef (Ye et al., 2015). The possible reason for its high antioxidant activity was due to the free hydroxyl in the C-3 position in C-ring and o-dihydroxy system (hydroxyl in the C-3\u2032 and 4\u2019 position) in the B-ring, which has been shown strong effect against free radicals (Burda & Oleszek, 2001).",

Liu et al. (2016) confirmed the inhibitory effect of DMY on Gram-negative food pathogen V. parahaemolyticus. The inhibitory effect increased with the increase of DMY concentration, the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of DMY against V. parahaemolyticus was observed at 0.625 mg/mL. Membrane damage was assumed to be the main antibacterial mechanism of DMY. In addition, it was observed that DMY could bind to proline dehydrogenase (PDH), a key regulatory and rate-limiting enzyme in the metabolism of proline. DMY interacted with primary amino acid residues (Glu 292, Arg 288, Tyr285, Gly 64) located within the active hydrophobic pockets of PDH (Fig. 1\na), leading to the decrease of PDH activity. The interference of normal proline metabolism by DMY was another possible reason for V. parahaemolyticus cell death (Ding, Xiao, Liu, & Pang, 2017).",

DMY achieved bactericidal activity by dual effects of cell membrane damage and DNA binding (Wu, Bai, Zhong, Huang, & Gao, 2017). However, in the study of Huang, Huang, Chen, Yang, and Huang (2015), the effect of DMY on the inhibition of S. aureus PriA (SaPriA), an essential helicase for DNA replication restart, was not so significant. Furthermore, Huang (2015) investigated the inhibitory effect of DMY on dihydropyrimidinase, a key member in the chain of pyrimidine catabolism and metabolism of DNA base in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. DMY significantly inhibited dihydropyrimidinase with IC50 values of 48 \u03bcM. DMY was docked in the active site pocket of dihydropyrimidinase and formed a stable complex with dihydropyrimidinase (Fig. 1b).

About 70% HIV-1 CXC-chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) was reduced by DMY at 1 mg/mL. The anti-HIV-1 effect of DMY was partly due to down-regulation of CXCR4 on the surface of target cells. Grand, Garofalo and Neamati (2008) also confirmed CXCR4 was the major HIV co-receptors and promising targets for anti-HIV drugs. Moreover, Ren and Song (2005) observed that the combined use of myricitrin and DMY has shown great promise in resisting different kinds of virus such as hepatitis B virus, influenza virus and/or coronavirus.",

Moreover, DMY could also suppress lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammatory cytokine production in cells. For example, DMY inhibited nitric oxide secretion, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) production and p65 phosphorylation in LPS-stimulated macrophages and reduced carrageenan-induced acute inflammation in vivo (Wang, Pi, et al., 2016).",

DMY has been shown to restore and promote the apoptotic mode of cell death in many types of cancer cells. DMY was proved to promote ROS generation and activation of mitochondria-dependent apoptosis in human hepatocarcinoma HepG2 cells (Lin et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2017) and human non-small cell lung cancer (Kao et al., 2017). Moreover, DMY induced apoptosis in human gastric cancer cells (Ji et al., 2015), mouse hepatoma Hepal-6 cell (Liu et al., 2015) and hepatocellular carcinoma hepG2 cells (Huang et al., 2017). Recently, it was found that DMY can induce not only apoptosis but also autophagy in HepG2 cell lines (Xia et al., 2014) and human melanoma cells (Zhou et al., 2017). In head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, DMY induced the upregulation of autophagic markers such as Beclin1, LC3, and p62 and promoted carcinoma cells apoptosis (Fan et al., 2016).",

According to the published results, there is a controversy about the toxicity of plant flavonoids. On one hand, the use of plant flavonoids was regarded as non-toxic in some researches (Elliott Middleton et al., 2000; Middleton & Kandaswami, 1994). One the other hand, plant flavonoids was considered to act as pro-oxidants (Sahu & Gray, 1996) and mutagenic agents in bacteria and mammalian test systems (Dzoyem, Hamamoto, Ngameni, Ngadjui, & Sekimizu, 2013; Skibola & Smith, 2000).",

Furthermore, Zhong, Zhou, and Chen (2003) and Zhao et al. (2009) studied chronic toxicity of the total flavone of A. grossedentata. Continuous administration for a long time had no negative effect on the development and the indexes of hematology, biochemistry and pathology. They concluded that the evaluated total flavone (DMY) of A. grossedentata was toxicologically safe.

            "text": "Understanding the mechanism of DMY absorption, metabolism and elimination is essential for evaluating its bioavailability efficacy and level of drug intake (Manach, Scalbert, Morand, Remesy, & Jimenez, 2004). However, little information is available on DMY's absorption profiles, distribution, metabolism, and excretion in animal models and in human body. In a recent study (Xiang et al., 2018), a human intestinal Caco-2 cell model was used to investigate the uptake and transport mechanism of DMY. The effect of time, concentration, pH, temperature and efflux transporters on its uptake and transport were systematically evaluated. The results showed that DMY was poorly absorbed by a passive diffusion mechanism. The uptake and transport of DMY were time and concentration dependent. Decreasing the pH from 8.0 to 6.0 markedly enhanced the DMY uptake, but didn't significantly affect its bidirectional transport. DMY's poor absorptions into blood and instability under the intestinal environment were also observed in a pharmacokinetic study conducted by Tong et al. (2015), which suggesting that DMY might be metabolized and eliminated in the intestinal tract. In addition, the gastrointestinal stability of DMY in vitro was investigated as well (Xiang et al., 2017). DMY was stable in simulated gastric fluids and buffer solutions (pH 1.2), but encountered a pseudo-first-order kinetic degradation in simulated intestinal fluids and buffer solutions (pH 6.8), which indicated gastrointestinal pH is an important factor that strongly influenced the stability, absorption and bioavailability of DMY (Abuhelwa, Foster, & Upton, 2016). The efflux transporters present in the human intestinal tract are assumed to be another factor that influenc the processes of drug absorption and distribution (Couture, Nash, & Turgeon, 2006). Multidrug resistance protein 2 (MRP2) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) were proved to be involved in the uptake and transport of DMY, which hindered absorption of DMY in the intestinal tract (Xiang et al., 2018). Previous reports revealed that the transport of flavonoids such as kaempferol (Zheng et al., 2016) and baicalein (Kalapos-Kovacs et al., 2015) was also modulated by these 2 efflux transporters in Caco-2 cells.",

The results showed that unconverted DMY could be distributed rapidly in various tissues especially in the gastrointestinal tract and was able to cross the blood\u2212brain barrier. The elimination of DMY was rapid as well, which could almost be completed within 12 h. Most of eliminated DMY (unconverted) were found in feces rather than urine. DMY metabolites were detected and identified in urine and feces. This is possibility due to the different excretion pathways. Normally, metabolites of flavonoids may follow 2 pathways of excretion, i.e., via the biliary or the urinary route. Large conjugated metabolites are more likely to be eliminated in the bile, whereas small conjugates are preferentially excreted in urine (Manach et al., 2004). The relative magnitude of urinary and biliary excretion varies from one flavonoid to another in animals (Crespy et al., 2003). Besides, metabolite structures and metabolic pathways were also identified by Fan et al. (2017). A total of eight metabolites were detected and five metabolic pathways consisting of reduction, dehydroxylation, methylation, glucuronidation, and sulfation were proposed, which was agree with the previously reported results (Zhang et al., 2007).",

Solid dispersion is an effective strategy to improve the bioavailability of poorly water soluble drugs (Fig. 3a). Hydrophilic polymers polyethylene glycol (PEG) or polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) were used as polymeric carriers to form solid dispersions by Ruan et al. (2005) to increase DMY solubility and dissolution rate. DMY concentration in water increased as a function of PEG and PVP concentration at 25 \u00b0C and 37 \u00b0C. The improvement of the solubility might be attributed to improved wettability and dispersibility of DMY by forming intermolecular hydrogen bonding between DMY and PVP or PEG. DMY was dissolved or suspended in the carrier (PVP or PEG), resulting in a really true solution (Leuner & Dressman, 2000). Solid dispersions, although effective for improving the biopharmaceutical performance of poorly soluble compounds, are faced with the problems of physical instability, recrystallization tendency and poor scale-up (Vasconcelos et al., 2007).",

Nanocapsules are polymeric nanoparticles composed of an oily core surrounded by a polymeric wall stabilized by surfactants at the particle/water interface (Fig. 3b). Dalcin et al.

DMY-loaded nanocapsules not only demonstrated improved physicochemical properties (bioavailability) but also effective antimicrobial and anti-biofilm activity on urinary catheters infected by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. DMY-loaded nanocapsules reduced 67% of the biofilm population in urinary catheters in 96 h of treatment, while free DMY only eliminated 41%. Furthermore, a sustained release of DMY-loaded nanocapsule was observed as compared to free DMY. However, poor scalability, poor stability against aggregation and use of organic solvents are the major problems encountered during nanoencapsulation.",

DMY microemulsion showed higher drug release (72.34%) as compared to plain drug suspension (36.28%) and the commercially available tablet (46.91%), due to solubility-enhancing component of surfactant and cosurfactant. Despite the improvement in drug solubility and enhancement of bioavailability, micromulsions are not so effective in improving absorption because they have lower membrane permeability (Lawrence & Rees, 2012).",

Cyclodextrins as pharmaceutical excipients are mainly used as solubilizing and stabilizing agents for lipophilic substances in aqueous preparations (Astray, Gonzalez-Barreiro, Mejuto, Rial-Otero, & Simal-G\u00e1ndara, 2009; Suvarna, Gujar, & Murahari, 2017). DMY has been encapsulated in different substituents of cyclodextrin to increase the solubility and dissolution rate (Fig. 3d). Solubility enhancement for DMY was 14.1-fold at 25 \u00b0C and 10.7-fold at 37 \u00b0C by forming inclusion complexes with \u03b2-cyclodextrin (\u03b2-CD) (Ruan et al., 2005). In another study of Liu, Li, et al. (2012) and Liu, Ma, et al. (2012), DMY was completely dispersed in the hydroxypropyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin (HP-\u03b2-CD) matrix, the solubility of DMY in water increased from 0.74 to 53.64 mg/mL. The stability and antioxidant activity of DMY was greatly enhanced. Furthermore, Yang et al. (2011) also confirmed the solubility and stability enhancement of DMY in water by HP-\u03b2-CD; the inclusion complex not only affected the progress of the Human Hep G2 cell cycle but also induced cells to enter into apoptosis. Recently, a systemic investigation of the inclusion complexation between different HP\u2013CDs and \u03b2-CD with DMY was conducted by Liu, Li, Nguyen, and Zhao (2012). The stability of their inclusion complexes formed with different CDs followed the rank order: HP-\u03b2-CD (MW 1540) > HP-\u03b2-CD (MW 1460) > HP-\u03b2-CD (MW 1380) >\u03b2-CD > HP-\u03b3-CD > HP-\u03b1-CD. Steric effect and hydrophobicity of the DMY was the major cause for the stability of the formed inclusion complex. The B ring of the DMY was most likely involved in hydrogen bonding with the side groups in the cavity of the CDs, through which the inclusion complex was stabilized. Although being as a good solubilizing and stabilizing agents, cyclodextrins are prone to disruption and are coupled with lower apparent permeability.",

Cocrystals are structurally homogeneous crystalline materials containing two or more components with one component as active pharmaceutical ingredient (API), the other component as coformers (Bavishi & Borkhataria, 2016) (Fig. 3e). In cocrystals, the molecular components are held together essentially via \u2018nonbinding\u2019 interactions (H-bonds, van der Waals forces, hydrophobic interactions, etc.) without altering the covalent bond structure of the APIs (Dalpiaz, Pavan, & Ferretti, 2017), thus retaining their pharmacological activity properties. The physical properties, such as solubility, dissolution rate, permeability, stability, and compaction behavior can be improved by co-crystallization process. Wang, Tong, et al. (2016) prepared two novel soluble cocrystals of DMY with caffeine and urea and evaluated their physicochemical properties. The maximum solution concentrations were reached within 20 min for two cocrystals (1.061 and 0.625 mg/mL for DMY-caffeine and DMY-urea, respectively). Both cocrystal powders could generate solutions of higher concentrations than DMY and maintained some degree of supersaturation for at least 3 days. The enhanced solubility of DMY in co-crystals was achieved mainly due to a decrease in lattice energy and an increase in solvent affinity. The co-crystallization process faces with the problems of complex preparation and the premature precipitation of poorly soluble drug.",

Phospholipids act as an amphipathic molecules showing considerable solubility in both aqueous and lipid media (Fig. 3f). Besides, phospholipids are one of the major components of the cell membrane, which facilities the permeation of the drug across the lipid-rich membrane without disturbing the cellular lipid bilayer, hence increasing its bioavailability (Khan, Alexander, Ajazuddin, Saraf, & Saraf, 2013; Zhang et al., 2016). Liu, Du, Jie, Chen, and Niu (2009) developed DMY-lecithin complex in order to improve the hydrophobicity of DMY.The solubility of DMY in n-octanol rose from 9.63 to 22.38 mg/mL. The lipophilic property of DMY was significantly improved due to DMY combination with lecithin by a non-covalent bond. Furthermore, the antioxidant performance of DMY was improved after being complexed with the lecithin. Phospholipid complex may be considered as a promising drug delivery system for improving the overall absorption and bioavailability of the plant flavonoid.

            "text": "In order to increase the solubility and stability of DMY in fatty phase, acylation of DMY (Fig. 3g) makes them more hydrophobic by fatty acid linkage, as reported in several studies (Guo et al., 2013; Li, Zheng, & Ning, 2005; Matsumoto & Tahara, 2001). Li et al. (2005) esterified DMY with lauroyl chloride, and the antioxidant activity of the obtained product (DMY-laurate) in lard oil was superior to that of DMY. Furthermore, the solubility and antioxidant activity of synthesized single-and multi-acylated DMY in peanut oil phase increased compared with DMY (Guo et al., 2013). However, chemical acylation is not regioselective and leads to an unwanted functionalization of phenolic hydroxyl groups. On the contrary, the enzymatic acylation of DMY has gained increasing attention due to its high efficiency, green process, mild reaction conditions and high regioselectivity. As for instance, enzymatic acylation of DMY was achieved by several lipases with fast reaction rate and high conversion yield (Li et al., 2015). Furthermore, Deng et al. (2016) designed a polydopamine-coated magnetic iron oxide nanoparticle (PD-MNPs) to immobilize Aspergillus niger lipase (ANL) to increase stability, reusability and catalytic performances of the lipase. The ANL@PD-MNPs was applied as a biocatalyst for the regioselective acylation of DMY in DMSO and gave a conversion of 79.3%, which was higher than that of previous reports (Li et al., 2015). Recently, Cao et al. (2017) used a novel deep eutectic solvent (DES)\u2212DMSO cosolvent system as the reaction medium for enzymatic acylation of DMY catalyzed by ANL@PD-MNPs. The conversion of DMY was 91.6%. The lipid-solubility of DMY-16-acetate was 10 times higher than that of DMY. The lipase-catalyzed derivatives exhibited relatively strong radical scavenging abilities.",

Oxidation was reported as the main cause of changes in DMY, Avoiding metal ions, high temperature and alkaline conditions during processing and storage is important to minimize the degradation of DMY. DMY also faces with the problem of poor bioavailability, which limited its pharmacological effects and clinical application. To overcome this barrier, researchers have tried to use different strategies to enhance DMY solubility and bioavailability in both aqueous or lipid phase. Formulations based on solid dispersion, nanocapsule, microemuslion, cyclodextrin inclusion complexes, co-crystallization, phospholipid complexes, and chemical or enzymatic acylation have been proposed to increase lipid solubility. Understanding the mechanism of DMY absorption, metabolism and elimination is essential for evaluating its in vivo bioavailability efficacy. DMY digested in laboratory animals undergoes reduction, dehydroxylation, methylation, glucuronidation, and sulfation. On the basis of the current review, the future research needs for DMY should focus on the following three aspects: (i) development of new delivery systems for DMY to obtain higher encapsulation, overall absorption and bioavailability efficiencies; (ii) pharmacokinetic studies of encapsulated DMY such as absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion in an in vivo setting on higher animals and humans; (iii) transformation of these encapsulated DMY into safe products providing health benefits for the consumer.",
