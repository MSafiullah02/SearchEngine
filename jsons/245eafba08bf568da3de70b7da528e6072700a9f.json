It is paramount, in such critical situations, to implement swift mechanisms, and various agencies work in coordination to limit the spread of the disease. It is expected that broad range of situational intelligence and automated targeted response is needed throughout the community to ensure the safety of people and assets, with an aim to lower the fatalities and minimize impact on the economy. However, even in the cities where strict social distancing guidelines were issued to limited movement, it has been noticed the technology can play a role in enforcing such restrictions. In the United States [2] , New York, San Francisco, New Orleans, and Philadelphia ranked as the most vulnerable specifically in terms of health risks. These large cities are vulnerable due to high population density and higher use of public transportation, according to the report. Also, about 61% percent of New York City residents commute using public transportation compared to less than 0.1% of residents from Amarillo, TX, which ranked as one of the least vulnerable cities in the United States.",

The flexibility of the architecture to adapt to various use-case requirements can be achieved by having a hybrid edge cloud supported model which enable dynamic real time needs, and at the same time offer infinite computation on data captured using central cloud infrastructures. Basic Safety Messages (BSMs) can also be used to enable V2X communication with information pertaining to an event, location or even severity. It is also viable to create digital twins for various smart devices to offer a virtual counterpart for each physical object. These twins, based on the data collected in the real environment, can provide insights to improve the operations, increase efficiency and discover issues.",

At the same time, automatic disinfectant and fogging can be deployed in certain locations based number of existing cases, vulnerability or large gatherings. Parking availability can be shared in real time with the cloud services and registered individuals can be allotted a time to ensure minimal human interface.

For example, state police in Western Australia, Derbyshire police in England, the local police in Italy, and local police in New Jersey [8] plan to utilize drones to enforce social distancing. The drones can be used to monitor areas like, recreational parks, beaches, and public transits, ensuring people comply with the most recent forged gathering rules. Based on the severity of infection in a particular place, more or less stringent rules can be used. This can be done by using body heat temperature sensors to detect the number of people present at one particular place. Upon detecting a higher than the allowed number, drones can instruct the people to evacuate the place due to a higher chance of getting infected. It can also be used to detect proximity of people to enforce distancing rules. If a particular area is known to be a hot infectious spot, a complete lock down can be enforced.",

Using such information, different restrictions can be added on the number of vehicles parked at a particular location. For example, a parking space at a grocery store might allow more cars to be parked at one particular time than a senior home which is more critical due to the occupancy of elderly people who are more prone to COVID-19. Changing the parking rules at different locations, each with its own parking rules to alleviate gathering, can be challenging.

Formal policies for social distancing privacy are necessary and must address several issues including secure data collection, video surveillance, users/residents consent, and trusted third-parties involved, to say the least.

For instance, attaching devices to electric public lighting not only needs municipality collaboration but also isolation from other critical systems which poses a burden on time and effort and, in turn, increases the costs. Another example, battery powered devices (e.g., drones) are limited in the amount of time they operate and the information they can transmit by the battery lifetime. Not to mention, regular maintenance of such devices can be very costly, given they are usually deployed in large numbers. Costs also include operating costs. For instance, NYC operated an Automated Speed Enforcement program in 140 school zones with 180 speed cameras for over two years at a cost of $69,460,446 [14] . It is worth mentioning that enforcing social distancing may add on to those aforementioned costs due to the need of particular devices and sensors (e.g., drones equipped with body heat sensors for crowd detection).",

Additionally, enforcing social distancing in and by itself reduces costs. During the COVID-19 outbreak cutting down the number of patients will substantially reduce the healthcare sector costs.

These, including aforementioned scenarios, are examples where enforcing social distancing helps in saving money.
