Since their discovery in 1980, the TLR molecules have been described in numerous cell types throughout the body [3] . Currently, the human TLR family comprises ten TLRs and each is distinguished by their ligand specificity [3] . Also, each TLR has a unique location and expression pattern within the cell. For example, TLR3, 7 and 9 are located manly within the cellular endosome while the remaining TLRs (TLR2, 4, 5, 6) are found on the cell membrane.

Moreover, TGF-\u03b2 can act upon RPE cell causing the release of VEGF, PDGF and hemooxygenase [20, 54, 55] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 111, "end": 115, "text": "[53]", "ref_id": "BIBREF51"}, {"start": 606, "end": 610, "text": "[20,", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 611, "end": 614, "text": "54,", "ref_id": "BIBREF52"}, {"start": 615, "end": 618, "text": "55]", "ref_id": "BIBREF53"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "RPE Cell Participation in Immunoregulation"}, {"text": "The manner by which RPE cellular receptor for complement and PD-L1 regulate the immune response have been described and are outlined in Fig. 6.4 .

The adaptive immune response involves antibody-mediated and cell-mediated immune responses (Table 6 .2). Antigen processing and presentation represent the hallmark of the adaptive immune response. An overview of all the components and their interactions during the adaptive immune response is not possible here however, early experiments establishing the RPE as an APC will be briefly mentioned. We direct the reader to the following review, [56] . Major Histocompatibility Complex, MHC, class I and II molecules, which serve as the recognition system capable of distinguishing self Since antigen presentation is the central component of adaptive immunity, our laboratories explored the expression and function of MHC molecules within the retina. When one evaluates the normal retina, MHC class I and II molecules are not expressed. We noted that when retinal tissue obtained from patients with uveitis, retinitis pigmentosa or Sympathic Ophthalmia were evaluated, the RPE cell expressed MHC class I and II molecules and the infiltrating T cells contained IL-2 and IFN-\u03b3 [57] [58] [59] . Next, our in vitro studies demonstrated that IFN-\u03b3 treatment up-regulated both class I and class II molecules on normal RPE cells and hence equipped the cell to participate as a resident APC in the retina [60, 61] . In a series of in vitro studies we demonstrated that both retinal and non-retinal (BCG) antigens can be pro-cessed and presented by the activated RPE cell [60] . These finding were an essential first step underscoring the important role of the RPE cell in inflammatory, infectious and degenerative disorders.

One of the first animal models to explore retinal inflammation was experimental autoimmune uveitis, EAU, which is a T cellmediated disease that mimics human uveitis [62] . Using this model system, our laboratory tracked the expression of the MHC class II molecules on RPE cells and recorded the entry of inflammatory cells into the retina [63] . Moreover, following the administration of anti-MHC class II antibody prior to EAU induction, we observed that this treatment limited the expression of MHC class II molecules on RPE cells, reduced the severity of disease and significantly delayed the onset of EAU. Collectively, these studies helped to establish the critical role of the RPE cells in ocular autoimmunity and inflammation. Another animal model system used to clarify basic mechanisms involved in retinal degenerations was experimental coronavirus retinopathy (ECOR) [1] . This is the first retinal model to demonstrate a virus-induced degeneration, viral persistence, a genetic predisposition to virusinduced tissue damage and a virus triggered autoimmune response. ECOR is a retinal degenerative disease that is composed of three basic components; a virus component, a genetic component and an immunologic component [64] [65] [66] . Our early studies showed that inoculation of the neurotrophic JHM strain of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) into the vitreous or anterior chamber of BALB/c mice resulted in two distinct patterns of retinal pathology. The early phase of the disease, day 1-8, was characterized by retinal vasculitis and perivasculitis. The late phase of the disease, after day 10, was characterized by retinal degenerative changes. The retinal layers revealed disorganization with large areas of outer and inner segment loss. In addition, the RPE cells were morphologically abnormal with foci of RPE cell swelling, proliferation and cell atrophy [67, 68] . During this infection, we also noted that the RPE cell was the first cell infected by the virus [64, 65, 69, 70] . This was not unexpected since the RPE cell serves as an excellent reservoir for numerous pathogens. Analysis of retinal gene expression and protein expression identified the early upregulation of cytokines and chemokines, including, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, IFNs, CXCL9, CXCL10 and ICAM-1 [26, 71] . The presence of IFN-\u03b3 was also detected in the serum and served as the rational for the enhanced expression of MHC class I and II molecules on the RPE cell.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 272, "end": 276, "text": "[62]", "ref_id": "BIBREF60"}, {"start": 446, "end": 450, "text": "[63]", "ref_id": "BIBREF61"}, {"start": 984, "end": 987, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 1335, "end": 1339, "text": "[64]", "ref_id": "BIBREF62"}, {"start": 1340, "end": 1344, "text": "[65]", "ref_id": "BIBREF63"}, {"start": 1345, "end": 1349, "text": "[66]", "ref_id": "BIBREF64"}, {"start": 1976, "end": 1980, "text": "[67,", "ref_id": "BIBREF65"}, {"start": 1981, "end": 1984, "text": "68]", "ref_id": "BIBREF66"}, {"start": 2083, "end": 2087, "text": "[64,", "ref_id": "BIBREF62"}, {"start": 2088, "end": 2091, "text": "65,", "ref_id": "BIBREF63"}, {"start": 2092, "end": 2095, "text": "69,", "ref_id": "BIBREF67"}, {"start": 2096, "end": 2099, "text": "70]", "ref_id": "BIBREF68"}, {"start": 2379, "end": 2383, "text": "[26,", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 2384, "end": 2387, "text": "71]", "ref_id": "BIBREF69"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Decrease Complement mediated cytotoxicity Checkpoint Inhibitors Suppress T cells Complement Inhibitory Receptors"}, {"text": "The genetic constitution of the host can be a critical factor in determining the outcome of a viral infection and this was also observed in ECOR [72] . The susceptible strain of mice, BALB/c, were not the only rodent strain examined. CD-1 mice were extensively studied after coronavirus infection. During the early phase of the disease (day 1-8) both strains of mice showed that the virus infected and replicated within the retina and this was associated with a typical retinal vasculitis. However, on day 10-140, only the BALB/c mice experienced the late phase of the disease marked by retinal degeneration. In contrast, in the resistant strain, CD-1 mice, the retina reverted to a normal architecture. We have identified two key differences between the mouse strains that contributed to this retinal degeneration. First, a distinct difference in the intensity of the innate immune response was observed in these mice that developed a retinopathy compared to the mice without late retinal disease. At day 2 and 3 the BALB/c mice had extremely high levels of IFN-\u03b3, CXCL9 and CXCL10 which was measured by retinal gene expression. These same elevated levels of cytokines were found in the serum [26] . When CXCL9 and CXCL10 interact with its receptor, CXCR3 on T cells and NK cells, immune cells migrate to specific targets, in this case to the retina. The second distinct difference was the observation that the retinal degenerative process in BALB/c mice was associated with the presence of antiretinal autoantibodies. These antibodies were directed against the neural retina and the RPE cell. In contrast, these autoantibodies were not detected in the sera from normal or mock injected BALB/c mice. Likewise, none of the CD-1 mice developed antiretinal antibodies [66] . These mice also produced significantly lower levels of CXCL9 and CXCL10. Therefore, the mice that failed to develop antiretinal antibodies also failed to develop a retinal degeneration. These findings suggest a role for autoimmunity in the pathogenesis of ECOR and illustrate how a robust innate immune response may contribute to a heightened adaptive immune response that leads to a retinal degeneration. This model recapitulates key elements of human retinal degenerative diseases and serves as a template for exploring basic mechanisms of this degenerative process.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 145, "end": 149, "text": "[72]", "ref_id": "BIBREF70"}, {"start": 1194, "end": 1198, "text": "[26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 1766, "end": 1770, "text": "[66]", "ref_id": "BIBREF64"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Decrease Complement mediated cytotoxicity Checkpoint Inhibitors Suppress T cells Complement Inhibitory Receptors"}, {"text": "Development of new powerful technologies to support translational studies in human immunology have led to significant findings in basic and clinical immunology as well as in visual science.
