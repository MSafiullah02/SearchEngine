            "text": "In its natural host, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) has been reported to have a restricted tropism for cells of the monocyte/macrophage lineage. To date, cloned monkey kidney cell lines, such as MARC-145 and CL2621 cells which have been established from MA-104 cells, are the only non-porcine cells known to support PRRSV replication. In the present study, a binding assay was set up to follow by flow cytometry the attachment of PRRSV on the surface of porcine and non-porcine cells. PRRSV was found to be able to bind permissive cells like porcine alveolar macrophages and MARC-145. Further binding assays with porcine peripheral blood leukocytes showed that only monocytes can attach the virus. By their lack of binding factor, lymphocytes appeared to be refractory to PRRSV infection. Pre-incubation of MARC-145 cells with chymotrypsin and pronase E, but not neuraminidase, blocked their binding activity for PRRSV. The binding activity of the protease-treated cells was regenerated 8 hours after treatment, but cells remained unable to bind PRRSV if maintained in the presence of cycloheximide, thus confirming the proteinic nature of the specific binding factor(s). Experiments conduced with cells that have been previously characterized as non-permissive to PRRSV infection showed that many of them were able to bind the virus. Data obtained suggest that interaction of PRRSV with a specific binding factor on the surface of some cells is not sufficient to lead to a productive infection, and that a second putative receptor or other phenomena are probably required to pursue later events.",

            "text": "Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is the causative agent of a new disease in swine, that has spread rapidly in most of the pig producing countries. The disease is characterized by severe reproductive failure in sows and gilts, and respiratory problems in pigs of all ages [13] . PRRSV belongs to the recently recognized Arteriviridae family within the genus Arterivirus, order Nidovirales, along with equine arteritis virus (EAV), lactate deshydrogenase-elevating virus (LDV) and simian hemorrhagic fever virus (SHFV) [3, 4, 8] . These viruses share morphological and genomic similarities, can establish persistent infection in their natural host, and have a predilection for cells of the monocyte/macrophage lineage [38] . Mature PRRS virions are enveloped, approximately 60 to 70 nm in diameter, and possess an icosahedral capsid [2, 5] . The genome of the PRRSV is a positive single-stranded RNA molecule of approximately 15 kb in length, containing nine open reading frames (ORFs) that are transcribed in the infected cells as a nested set of subgenomic mRNAs [29, 40] . The ORF1a and ORF1b, located at the 5 end of the genome, represent nearly 75% of the viral genome and encode proteins with apparent replicase and polymerase activities [29, 38] . The ORFs 2 to 7, located at the 3 end of the genome, encode for major and minor structural proteins, except ORF3 of North American isolates which has been reported to encode a non-structural, but antigenic glycosylated protein, and the ORF2b which still need to be characterize as a structural protein in case of PRRSV [12, 25, 30, 40] . The three major structural proteins consist in a glycosylated envelope protein of 25 kDa (GP 5 ), an unglycosylated membrane (M) protein of 19 kDa, and a 14 kDa nucleocapsid (N) protein, encoded by ORFs 5, 6 and 7, respectively [25, 26, 30] . Three other putative minor membrane-associated proteins, GP 2 (30 kDa), GP 4 (31 kDa) and E (ORF2b product, 7,4 kDa) have been also identified [31, 40, 43] .",

The virus was first isolated on primary cultures of porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs) and so far, these cells as well as blood monocytes, remain the only porcine cells that can effectively be used for viral propagation ex-vivo [44, 45] . In situ hybridization studies have established that the virus also infects macrophages in the spleen, liver, Peyer's patches, thymus, as well as microglial cells, but peritoneal macrophages and progenitor cells in the bone marrow are refractory [22, 41] . The testicular germ cells (spermatids) have been also shown to allow PRRSV replication [42] . This was the first report showing that PRRSV can also infect non-macrophage cells in its natural host. Two non-porcine permissive cell subclones, MARC-145 and CL2621 cells, both derived from the MA104 monkey kidney cell line are also routinely used for in vitro propagation of field and vaccine strains [1, 19] . It is difficult to extrapolate findings on the cellular susceptibility of PRRSV isolates from the European and North American continents, but data from routine diagnosis investigations, as well as several experimental studies, indicated that European strains of PRRSV are most successfully isolated in PAMs, whereas the great majority of North American strains can be initially isolated in the established monkey cell subpopulations [1, 27, 28] . The characteristics shared by these cell lines and PAMs allowing the infection by PRRSV are still unknown.",

            "text": "Factors implicated in the first stage of infection, which dictate the cell tropism, such as viral attachment protein(s) (VAP) and cellular receptor(s), have not been yet identified for arteriviruses. Although monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) directed against GP 4 and GP 5 of PRRSV have been reported to neutralize virus infection, the mechanism of neutralization has not been elucidated, as well as whether it occurs prior or after viral attachment [32, 37] . Recently, it has been demonstrated that absence of PRRSV binding to cells might be one major determinant of PRRSV cell tropism [21] . It has been also reported that PRRSV enters in PAMs and in MARC-145 cells through a mechanism of receptor-mediated endocytosis, suggesting that specific yet unidentified receptors for PRRSV may be the key factors for the restricted tropism [20, 35] . Recently, two monoclonal antibodies directed against a 210 kDa protein have been produced which are able to block partially virus attachment to the plasma membrane of porcine alveolar macrophages and to inhibit infection [10] . Since a clear colocalization exists between attached virus and aggregates of this protein on the plasma membrane, it was concluded that these MAbs recognize either specifically the PRRSV receptor or a protein which is in close contact with it [10, 36] . Further research is needed to confirm the role of this protein as a specific receptor or a co-receptor for PRRSV. Other investigators have demonstrated a previously non-reported hemagglutinating activity (HA) for PRRSV, as it is also the case for EAV [16, 39] . They also reported that this HA activity, as well as the propagation of the virus, could be inhibited by heparin and suggest that a heparin-like molecule on the surface of susceptible cells could also play the role of cellular receptor for PRRSV [17] . The present study was designed to further characterize the mechanism that restricts PRRSV replication in a variety of porcine and non-porcine cell lines. A flow cytometry method was adapted to follow the binding of PRRSV to the surface of cells and to determine the phenotype of peripheral blood cells susceptible to PRRSV. The use of different enzymatic treatments was also investigated to characterize the biochemical properties of the specific binding factor(s) for PRRSV.",

Peripheral blood cells (PBLs) were collected from 4-to 9-week-old pigs serologically negative for PRRSV, transmissible gastroenteritis virus, swine influenza virus, porcine parvovirus, Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae and Mycoplasma hyorhinis. Blood was diluted with one volume of Eagle's minimum essential medium (MEM) and centrifuged onto Ficoll-hypaque gradient (Pharmacia, Biotech, Baie d'Urf\u00e9, PQ, Canada). Leukocytes were removed from the buffy coat, and cultured in Dulbecco's-MEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 10 mM HEPES, 2 mM L-glutamine, 0,1 mM non-essential amino acids, 50 U/ml penicillin-streptomycin, 60 g/ml tylosin, 2,5 g/ml amphotoricin B, and 25 g/ml gentamycin sulfate. Porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs) were obtained by bronchoalveolar lavages and cultured, as previously described [45] . The MARC-145 cells were kindly provided to us by J. Kwang (U.S. Meat Animal Research Center, Clay Center, NE) and were grown as monolayers in MEM supplemented with 8% FBS, 10 mM HEPES, 2 mM L-glutamine and antibiotics. Continuous cell lines of African green monkey kidney (MA-104) cells, rabbit kidney cells (RK-13) and human carcinoma cells (293A) were cultured in DMEM containing 10% FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine, and antibiotics. Baby hamster kidney (BHK-21) cells were cultured in DMEM containing 10% FBS, 10% tryptose broth, 2 mM L-glutamine, and antibiotics. Porcine testicular cells (PT) and porcine kidney cells (PK-15) were cultured in MEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 2 mM L-glutamine, and antibiotics, whereas U937 cells, a human monocyte/macrophage cell line, were cultured in RPMI medium with 10% FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine, and antibiotics. The cell cultures were infected at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0,1 to 10 TCID 50 of virus per cell. Following an adsorption period of 90 min at room temperature, cells were washed twice in PBS and incubated with fresh medium for 48 h at 37 \u2022 C in an atmosphere of 5% CO 2 .",

Using a pool of neutralizing anti-GP 5 MAbs, only weak shifts of fluorescence could be revealed with both enriched PAMs and MARC-145 cells range was used as a parameter to follow fluorescence shift (data not shown) which could be attributed to the fact that these MAbs were all directed against linear antigenic determinants of the GP 5 [37] , in addition to the intensity of the background that was observed with some cell types. On the other hand, more significant results were obtained using IAF-K8 MAb directed against the N protein, which is a sticky and basic protein [7] , and this even if no special treatments were done to permeabilize the viral envelope. To assure that the shift of fluorescence observed in Fig. 1A and 1B was not due to the attachment of empty capsids, the binding assay was conduced with concentrated virus preparation that have been treated with chloroform or 1,1,2-Trichlorotrifluoroethane (Freon) prior to the binding assay. Chloroform was used as a lipidic solvent to solubilize the lipid bilayer surrounding the viral icosahedric nucleocapsid, whereas Freon was used to extract residual cellular or viral lipoproteins [11, 15] . As illustrated in Fig. 2A and 2B, following both treatments, virus binding on PAMs was almost completely abrogated to the level of the controls without virus, no shift in the fluorescence signals being observed. The presence of free empty capsids in the treated viral preparations was confirmed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis. As depicted in Fig. 2C , treatment with chloroform resulted in the lost of the membrane-associated proteins, especially the GP 5 and the M proteins with estimated M r of 25 and 19 kDa, in comparison to untreated purified virus. However, the N protein (15 kDa) remained present in amounts comparable to that observed with the untreated viral preparation, as well as the presence of a putative N dimer with estimated M r of approximately 30 kDa. On the other hand, the M and GP 5 envelope proteins could still be revealed following treatment with Freon, suggesting that the virus had lost its binding ability despite the conservation of its envelope components.

Similar flow cytometric patterns were obtained following pre-incubation of cells in the presence of 10 U/ml of pronase E (Table 1) . Fluorescence microscopy also showed that only a few scattered cells within confluent monolayers of the protease-treated MARC-145 cells could be detected by immunofluorescence with anti-N MAb after 48 h PI at a MOI of 10 (data not shown). Data suggested that few number of cells were probably infected by residual virus, remaining after the washing steps that followed the adsorption period, when newly binding molecules were regenerated at their surface. In further experiments, it was possible to demonstrate that MARC-145 can regenerate all of their binding activity 8 h after being treated with the above proteases (data not shown). However, reestablishment of the binding capacity of MARC-145 cells could not be recovered in the presence of cycloheximide, a specific inhibitor of the protein synthesis (Table 1) , thus confirming the proteinic nature of the specific binding factor(s). On the other hand, pre-incubation of MARC-145 cells in the presence of 10 U/mL of neuraminidase (RDE) did not seem to affect their binding capacity for PRRSV ( Table 1) .",

When granularity and expression of CD14 were considered in a plot graphic (Fig. 4C) , PBLs segregated in two distinct populations: one representing CD14 \u2212 cells (R1) and the other defined by the CD14 + cells (R2) (including CD14 low and CD14 hight ).

Region R3 was shown to contain CD4 + and CD8 + cells, and these cells were CD14 \u2212 , as defined above. On the other hand, region R4 contained cells that did not express CD4 or CD8 markers, but were SWC3 + and CD14 + .

Several studies confirmed that PRRSV has a strongly restricted tropism for cells of the monocyte/macrophage lineage both in vivo and in vitro [1, 5, 10, 22, 35, 44] . To further investigate on the cellular factors that determined the tropism of PRRSV, a specific binding assay was designed to follow the attachment of PRRSV on susceptible (that permit virus attachment) and permissive (that permit virus replication) cells. As expected, both MARC-145 cells and PAMs, were found to attach with high efficiency PRRSV on their surface and to allow completion of its replication cycle. Further experiments were made to confirm the specificity of the binding assay. The first objective was to eliminate the possibility that shift of fluorescence observed with PAMs and MARC-145 cells was due to the attachment of empty capsids reacting with the anti-N MAb IAF-K8 used to label viral particles attached at the surface of the cells. The second objective was to demonstrate that bound viral particles detected by flow cytometry analysis were still infectious. Treatment with chloroform and freon removed or interfered with the chemical nature of viral components that appeared to be necessary for attachment on the surface of susceptible cells. The data obtained following treatment with chloroform confirmed that free N protein or empty capsids did not have the ability to bind per se on the surface of both permissive cell types and that the viral envelope was most probably permeable or sufficiently damaged to allow interaction of the IAF-K8 MAb with virusassociated N protein. However, GP 5 and M proteins were still present following treatment of the PRRSV virion with freon. It may be possible that the latter treatment has affected the envelope integrity or has resulted in conformational changes somehow to interfere with attachment or interaction of virus binding protein (s) with a putative specific cellular receptor. Another possibility is that GP 5 and M are not the major components involved in the attachment of PRRSV on the surface of targeted cells. Minor envelope proteins, GP 4 , GP 2 and E, which are also exposed at the surface of the virion, could also be implicated in the interactions with a specific binding protein for PRRSV on the surface of susceptible cells.",

Since virus binding was not blocked following pre-treatment of cells with neuraminidase, sialic acid or NAMA is apparently not involved in PRRSV attachment to permissive cells. This study did not, however, allow to conclude whether the PRRSV-specific binding factor on PAMs and MARC-145 cells is the same. The MA104 cell line has been established from epithelial monkey kidney cells [19] , so their physiological functions in vivo are quite different from those of PAMs. Consequently, one can speculate that the entry of PRRSV in MARC-145 cells is probably mediated by a different mechanism: through an evolutionnary common ancestor receptor or a non-tissue-specific cell surface molecule. Since EAV and SHFV, but not LDV, have previously demonstrated their ability to infect MA-104 cells, from which MARC-145 cells have been established, one can speculate that PRRSV, EAV and SHFV enter by the same pathway in these epithelial cells via a common receptor [38] . However, the receptor on macrophages should be different since PAMs are not susceptible to EAV and LDV. Recently, a 210 kDa protein has been identified has a putative cellular receptor for PRRSV on PAMs, the latter being recognized by a specific MAb that blocks the infection [10] . Since this MAb does not recognise epitopes on the surface of porcine monocytes and also on MARC-145 cells, it seems that the pathway used by PRRSV in these cells is different than the one involved with PAMs [10] . In this regard, the hypothesis of a common binding factor and the possibility of a second receptor (such as the 210 kDa protein of PAMs) that would dictate specific tissue tropism is plausible.",

Thus binding of PRRSV on the host cells does not necessary lead to a productive infection, the basis for the restricted replication of PRRSV in certain cell types being found in the different subsequent steps that have to be passed through successfully before new viral particles are produced: internalization, release of the viral genome, transcription, translation and assembly [36] .",

The discrepancy obtained on the binding capacity of these two cell lines can be attributed to the technical approaches that have been used, the flow cytometry method being most probably more sensitive for the detection of bound viral particles at the surface of the cells than the recovery of biotinylated viral proteins by SDS-PAGE analysis of lysates of PRRSV-infected cells [21] . Interestingly, the production of infectious virus has been previously observed in Vero cells following polyethylene glycol-mediated fusion of virus and in BHK-21 and vero cells following transfection experiments with full-length infectious cDNA clones or infectious genomic RNA [21, 33] . In both cases, the cell membrane barrier was bypassed, therefore minimizing the importance of a specific surface cellular receptor for PRRSV. Thus, the restricted cell tropism in the case of PRRSV apparently also involved phenomena that occur following binding to the cell surface and releasing of the infectious RNA genome. The data previously obtained by others with Vero cells raise again the possibility that more than one cellular receptors is required for the internalization of PRRSV [21] .",

In this study, PRRSV infection was found to be restricted to CD14 + cells, indicating that lymphocytes cannot be infected in vitro by PRRSV because they probably lack a specific binding factor on their surface. In contrast, monocytes were found to be able to bind the virus and support the virus growth, as previously reported by others [34, 44] . Recently, it has been demonstrated that PRRSV has a restricted tropism for only some sub-populations of porcine monocytes/macrophages and that some specific states of differentiation and activation of monocytes/macrophages considerably affect their susceptibility, bone marrow cells being not susceptible to PRRSV as an example of immature cells of the monocyte/macrophage lineage [34] . Such a restricted tropism for only some sub-populations of monocytes/macrophages is also observed for LDV, since in young mice only differentiated peritoneal macrophages can be infected by this murine arterivirus [38] .",

The factors implied in this temporary immunodeficiency has not yet been identified. Data from experimental infection studies suggested that infection of the monocytes and macrophages at the early stages of the infection, compromises the first defense barrier of the upper respiratory tract and probably affects the presentation of antigens to cells of the lymph nodes, a step which is required to initiate a specific and effective immune response. The infection, and destruction of these cells, may perturb the regulatory mechanisms of synthesis or secretion of cytokines and chemokines, which are important for an effective immune response.",

The absence of such proteinic binding factor(s) at the surface of lymphocytes explains why they are refractory to PRRSV infection. Infection of PAMs and monocytes during the early stages of PRRSV infection certainly favours the establishment of secondary bacterial infections. The understanding of the restricted cellular tropism of PRRSV and that of other members of the Arteriviridae family, mainly the characterization of their specific cellular receptors, will be very helpful for better comprehension of their pathogenesis.",

At this incubation temperature, internalization of PRRSV was prevented. Similar results were obtained with MARC-145 cells(Fig. 1B). The flow cytometric patterns of fluorescence observed with both cell cultures indicated that most of the cells possess a specific binding factor for PRRSV.
