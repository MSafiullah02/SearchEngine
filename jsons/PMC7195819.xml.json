Some of these ongoing and emergent issues include immune and gastrointestinal disorders, reduction in bone density, sleep disorders, sensory sensitivities, weight management as well as challenges in executive and cognitive function.",

Over the years, diagnostic and clinical assessment criteria have undergone multiple iterations and adaptations (Kanner 1943; Verhoeff 2013; Wolff 2004). Autistic individuals also share commonalities including challenges in communication, social reciprocity, and behavior. Such challenges have not sufficiently been assessed throughout the life span, and little is known about how the aging process interacts with these challenges nor how autistic adults navigate and/or cope or struggle with the aging process. Such challenges likely impact overall impact experience, well-being, autonomy, life skills, and much more. Further, many autistic individuals grapple with co-occurring medical and behavioral health conditions (Ghaziuddin et al. 2002; Schiff and Asato 2015; Underwood et al. 2019); thus, inviting further focused study on autism and aging.",

Although our understanding of autistic adolescents and adults is growing, relatively little is known about autistic mid- and later-life (Wright et al. 2013). In contrast, for the general population, the fields of gerontology and geriatrics have received substantial attention, with studies and initiatives underway that may shed insight onto the aging process from the biologic, neuroscience, social science, and health service prospective (Freitas et al. 2002). Similar efforts focused on individuals on the autism spectrum will likely provide insights into providing life-long support as well as offering guidance for public policy. To that end, there is a need to review what is currently known about aging in the general population and in the autism community in order to ascertain priorities in both research and clinical and practice.",

Medical conditions may also be associated with behaviors of concern, such as head banging due to migraine headaches or ear infections. Disruptive and aggressive behaviors can also be associated with pain, most especially in those who are non-verbal or hypo-verbal and who cannot express or physically indicate the presence and location of their discomfort (e.g., De Lissovoy 1962, Durand and Moskowitz 2016, Mahler 2017). Other behaviors such as eye poking has been reported to be associated with calcium deficiency (Coleman 1994). Further complicating the diagnosis of associated medical conditions is the fact that individuals may not present with symptoms typically recognized by health care providers or specialists, and may therefore be missed. More research is needed regarding the role of co-occurring medical conditions in autism, including their symptomatic presentations and behavioral manifestations, how these medical conditions and symptomatic features may change with age, and how they can be accurately identified and effectively treated. We also need to learn more about specific health conditions associated with aging, such as arthritis, cancer, hypertension, diabetes, obesity, stroke, and dementia; and how these conditions manifest in autistic individuals. In addition, we need to know how autistic individuals respond to standard therapies commonly used to treat these conditions and if different, what therapeutic approaches would prove most effective in this population.",

Identified examples of promising programs/incentives were outlined, as follows:The Ontario (Canada) Working Group on Mental Health with ASD (https://www.porticonetwork.ca/web/adult-asd) has developed strategic plans to increase awareness about mental health needs of autistic adults among physicians.The Redpath Centre in Canada (https://redpathcentre.ca/) provides various services for autistic individuals and other neurodevelopmental conditions throughout the lifespan. They also conduct research, educate stakeholders and advocate for system change.First Place Arizona (USA) (https://www.firstplaceaz.org/) offers supportive housing which includes a residential transition program.Community-based Microboard systems (https://www.velacanada.org/vela-microboards) direct support and manage funding at the individual level.

In moving toward that end, cautions were strongly endorsed regarding core terminology, philosophical and practical understandings as well as theoretical underpinnings in practice, research and policy development. It was concluded that common practices in research, community services, policy, and societal discourses have variably and often insufficiently rendered autistic adults as central in commentary and planning about aspects pertaining to their own lives, including how autistic individuals are viewed and supported. In response, it was argued that \u2018engagement as central\u2019 needs to underpin adult and aging-based research in autism.",

Methodological advancement in building a strong aging autism research base has been emphatically advocated with particular attention needed in methods of recruitment, study design and data analysis. It is hoped that increased research in autism and aging will better support the autism community relative to supports and services specifically directed to autistic seniors. Applying current challenges, concerns and risks to seniors in congregate living facilities as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic warrant careful study about the unique risks and challenges faced by elderly and/or frail autistic persons in such settings and circumstances.",
