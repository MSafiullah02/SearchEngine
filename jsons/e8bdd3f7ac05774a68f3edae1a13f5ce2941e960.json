While existing disease-symptom relationship extraction methods are used as the foundation in the various medical tasks, no collection is available to systematically evaluate the performance of such methods. In this paper, we introduce the Disease-S ymptom Relation Collection (dsr-collection), created by five physicians as expert annotators. We provide graded symptom judgments for diseases by differentiating between relevant symptoms and primary symptoms. Further, we provide several strong baselines, based on the methods used in previous studies. The first method is based on word embeddings, and the second on co-occurrences of MeSH-keywords of medical articles. For the co-occurrence method, we propose an adaption in which not only keywords are considered, but also the full text of medical articles. The evaluation on the dsr-collection shows the effectiveness of the proposed adaption in terms of nDCG, precision, and recall.",

For example, abdominal pain and nausea are both symptoms of an appendicitis, but while abdominal pain is a key differentiating factor, nausea does only little to distinguish appendicitis from other diseases of the digestive system. While several disease-symptom extraction methods have been proposed that retrieve a ranked list of symptoms for a disease [7, 10, 13, 14] , no collection is available to systematically evaluate the performance of such methods [11] .

Notice that the diseases are selected from different medical disciplines: mental (e.g. Depression), dental (e.g. Periodontitis), digestive (e.g. Appendicitis), and respiration (e.g. Asthma). We calculate the inter-annotator agreement using Fleiss' kappa [2] , a statistical measure to compute the agreement for three or more annotators. For the annotation of the primary symptoms, we measure a kappa value of \u03ba = 0.61, which indicates a substantial agreement between the three annotators [6] . Individual \u03ba-values per disease are reported in Table 1 .

The raw co-occurrence of the disease x and symptom s, is denoted by co(x, s). The raw co-occurrence does not consider the overall appearance of each symptom across diseases. For instance, symptoms like pain or obesity tend to co-occur with many diseases, and are therefore less informative. Hence, the raw co-occurrence is normalized by an Inverse Symptom Frequency (ISF) measure, defined as ISF(s) = |X| ns , where |X| is the total number of diseases and n s is the number of diseases that co-occur with s at least in one of the articles. Finally, the disease-symptom relation is defined as \u03bb(x, s) = co(x, s) \u00d7 ISF(s). We compute three variants of the CoOccur method:",

While they did not evaluate the effectiveness of their diseasesymptom relation extraction method, they published their relation scores which we will evaluate in this paper. -FullText: Applying the CoOccur method only on MeSH-keywords has two disadvantages: First, keywords are not available for all articles (e.g. only 30% of the \u22481.5 million PMC articles have keywords) and second, usually only the core topics of an article occur as keywords. We address these limitations by proposing an adaption of the CoOccur method, in which we use the full text, the title, and the keywords of the \u22481.5 million PMC articles. Specifically, we adapt the computation of the co-occurrence co(x, s), as follows: We first retrieve a set of relevant articles to a disease x, where an article is relevant if the disease exists in either the keyword, or the title section of the article. Given these relevant articles and a symptom s, we compute the adapted co-occurrence co(x, s), which is the number of relevant articles in that the symptom occurs in the full text. The identification of the diseases in the title and symptoms in the full text is done using the MetaMap tool [1] .",

The FullText-variant of the CoOccur method outperforms the other baselines on all evaluation metrics. This demonstrates the high effectiveness of our proposed adaption to the CoOccur method. Further, we see a clear advantage of the CoOccur-method with MeSHkeywords from \u224830 million PubMed articles as the resource (KwdLarge) -in comparison to the same method with keywords from approximately 1.5 million PMC articles (Kwd). This highlights the importance of the number of input samples to the method. Error Analysis: A common error source is a result of the fine granularity of the symptoms in the medical vocabularies. For example, the utilized MeSH vocabulary contains the symptoms abdominal pain and abdomen, acute 4 . Both symptoms can be found in the top ranks of the evaluated methods for the disease appendicitis (see Table 3 ). However, since the corpus is not labeled on such a fine-grained level, the symptom abdomen, acute is counted as a false positive. Another error source is a result of the bias in medical articles towards specific disease-symptom relationships. For instance, between the symptom obesity and periodontitis 5 a special relationship exists, which is the topic of various publications. Despite obesity not being a characteristic symptom of a periodontitis, all methods return the symptom in the top-3 ranks. A promising research direction is the selective extraction of symptoms from biomedical literature by also considering the context (e.g. in a sentence) in that a disease/symptom appears.",
