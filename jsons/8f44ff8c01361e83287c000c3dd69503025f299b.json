Current pandemic is also characterized by surge in hospitalizations which has overwhelmed even the most resilient health systems. Therefore, it is imperative to assess supply side preparedness in tandem with demand projections for comprehensive outlook. OBJECTIVE: Hence, we attempted this study to forecast the demand of hospital resources for one year period and correspondingly assessed capacity and tipping points of Indian health system to absorb surges in demand due to COVID-19. METHODS: We employed age-structured deterministic SEIR model and modified it to allow for testing and isolation capacity to forecast the demand under varying scenarios. Projections for documented cases were made for varying degree of mitigation strategies of a) No-lockdown b) Moderate-lockdown c) Fulllockdown. Correspondingly, data on a) General beds b) ICU beds and c) Ventilators was collated from various government records. Further, we computed the daily turnover of each of these resources which was then adjusted for proportion of cases requiring mild, severe and critical care to arrive at maximum number of COVID-19 cases manageable by health care system of India. FINDINGS: Our results revealed pervasive deficits in the capacity of public health system to absorb surge in demand during peak of epidemic. Also, continuing strict lockdown measures was found to be ineffective in suppressing total infections significantly, rather would only push the peak by a month. However, augmented testing of 500,000 tests per day during peak (mid-July) under moderate lockdown scenario would lead to more reported cases (5,500,000-6,000,000), leading to surge in demand for hospital resources. A minimum allocation of 10% public resources and 30% private resources would be required to commensurate with demand under that scenario. However, if the testing capacity is limited to 200,000 tests per day under same scenario, documented cases would plummet by half.",

Since then, the number of cases have surged to 69,149 with 2,249 deaths as on May11, 2020. As part of the pandemic preparedness, in the absence of vaccines or antivirals, India adapted gamut of nonpharmaceutical interventions such as lockdown, quarantining and tracing and testing concomitantly to alter the trajectory of pandemic. These interventions encompassed two types of strategies a) Suppression, which aims to reverse epidemic growth, by minimizing the effective reproduction number (average number of secondary cases each case generates), R, to below 1 and thus, reduce case numbers to low levels and maintaining that indefinitely b) Mitigation, which aims to slow the spread of epidemic with the rationale of preventing significant overload on health system and gradually allowing the population to develop herd immunity (4) .",

In 2018, although India's SPAR composite score (0.75) was above the international average (0.61), albeit, the scores for indicators pertaining to health service provisioning and laboratory capacity were incongruous as India had only half the average readiness in these indicators as compared to international scores.

Disease progression is characterized by myriad of uncertainties and the trajectory of an epidemic is defined by some key factors and parameters. Specifically, for a novel infection whose disease dynamics are still unclear, mathematical models are thus, pertinent to understand the mechanics of transmission. Deterministic compartmental models such as Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious and Recovered (SEIR) are widely used to provide insight into disease progression and can be chosen over complex models due to minimum number of assumptions. Yet, there is a caveat in using the baseline SEIR model as it doesn't incorporate the testing capacity in the model which punctuates the dynamics in two ways. Firstly, in basic model, the undetected yet infectious individuals are not accounted in determining probability of infection and potential transmissibility and secondly, there's reduced transmissibility from confirmed positive cases which no longer transmit the disease once they are tested and isolated. Modelling exercises allowing for testing and isolation capacity and undetected cases are rather scarce. Further, COVID-19 has differential impact on different age groups and additionally, heterogeneities in contact networks have a major effect in determining whether pathogen can become epidemic or persist at endemic levels. Consequently, mathematical models of disease transmission incorporating age and social contact structures are more congruous to the reality. Therefore, in this study we have attempted the short and long term prediction of transmission of COVID-19 using age-structured compartment based model allowing heterogeneities in contact networks and simulating for varying assumptions and scenarios around containment and mitigation strategies. Drawing from international experience and literature on COVID-19, we determined the proportion of high-risk population with underlying conditions in India who are more vulnerable to progress into severe condition upon infection that can guide triage and targeted intervention decisions. Further, we assessed the capacity and tipping points of Indian health system to absorb surges in the number of people that will need hospitalization and critical care because of COVID-19 based on varying scenarios.",

            "text": "The spread of any virus is incumbent upon the infectivity of pathogen and the pool of susceptible population. We formulated the transmission dynamics model for the outbreak of COVID-19 in a heterogeneously mixing population. Compartmental disease models divide population into groups (or compartments) based on each individual's infection status and track the corresponding population sizes through time. SEIR model in which the population was divided according to infection status into Susceptible(S), Exposed (E), Infected (I) and Removed(R) was employed in the study. Susceptible individuals become infected at a given rate when they interact/contact with an infectious person and enter the exposed state. These exposed pool transition to infectious state after a latency period and later either recover or die. However, it is crucial to consider host age structure to enable realistic modelling for disease prevention policy. Also, the spread of an infectious disease is sensitive to the contact patterns in the population as person-to-person transmission is largely driven by who interacts with whom. The agespecific mixing patterns of individuals in age group i alter their likelihood of being exposed to the virus given the extent of infections in the group. The assumption of homogenously mixing population can lead to an overestimation of the final epidemic size and magnitude of interventions needed to stop an epidemic (5) . Contrarily, including contact patterns that vary across age and locations (e.g. home, work, and schools) as predictors in transmission dynamic model improves the model's realism. Thus, we investigated the impact that different mixing assumptions have on the spread of COVID-19 in an age structured SEIR model with infectivity in both latent and infectious period described by a system of ordinary differential equations.",

Further, age-distributed data from U.S. was used to estimate the epidemiological parameters in the study. As reported in Table 2 , age wise fractions of transition from one state to another and case fatality ratio (CFR) was calculated from the report published by U.S. Center for Disease Control (9), as currently in India (as of 2 nd May), CFR is analogous to that of USA when CDC carried out the study. Also, we collated the data on confirmed positive cases, hospitalizations, recovery and deaths from publicly available time series data of USA published by U.S. CDC (10) to estimate the probability of infection \u03b2'. Remaining model parameters such as latency rate, testing rate and rate of recovery/death were estimated using crowdsourced Indian data (11) from 10 th March 2020 till 2 nd May, 2020 while incorporating mitigation strategies of lockdown starting from 24 th March to 3 rd May and current social distancing guidelines based on the zones which is issued by Indian government starting from 3 rd May to 17 th May. Three scenarios of mitigation measures were modeled -(a) Full lockdown (assuming closure of schools, workplace and community spaces and doubling of contacts in households) (b) Social distancing measures and moderate lockdown (assuming closure of schools, staggered opening of workplace and community spaces with half strength and social distancing of vulnerable population including aged above 70 years and people with at-least one underlying high risk chronic condition with 75% compliance) post 17 th May, 2020 and (c) No lockdown (assuming 100% contacts in schools, workplace, community spaces and households).

Therefore, analyzing the prevalence of highrisk underlying condition associated with COVID-19 is germane to understand the progression of cases from mild to severe/critical stage and identify the vulnerable population to design more effective interventions. Hence, we used the information on burden of chronic diseases from a study conducted by London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (14) Therefore, we used the information on prevalence of these underlying conditions in India (Table 3 ) by culling out information from above-mentioned study to estimate proportion of population with at-least one underlying condition.",

This tool enables the modelling of steady state patient flow dynamics that can guide the tipping point of health care system in terms of the availability of hospital beds, ICU beds and mechanical ventilators. Entire dynamics of supply side readiness is explained in Figure 4 . The left-hand panel in the figure is representative of the current health capacity with total number of hospital beds, ICU beds and ventilators. Average length of stay determining the daily turnover rates for mild, severe and critical cases were set as 11.76 days, 17.76 days and 17.76 days respectively (parameter values from model). Using population-weighted age-stratified probabilities, number of cases requiring hospital beds, ICU beds and ventilators was estimated. Further, the daily turnover of each of these resources was measured by dividing the number of available resources with average length of stay for that resource. Thereafter, the daily turnover rates were divided by the proportion of cases requiring mild, severe and critical care to arrive at the maximum number of COVID cases manageable by health care system of India. Three distinct cases based on the allocation of resources were made to discern the surge capacity for each of these cases. In all three cases, we assumed that public health facilities dedicate fixed 10% of their hospital beds, ICU beds and ventilators for COVID-19 patients since existing bed occupancy rate of public hospitals in India is around 94% (19) . However, for private sector hospitals, varied assumptions pertaining to allocation was made. Under case 1, the provision of private infrastructure was assumed to be 0. Whereas, the allocation of hospital beds, ICU beds and ventilators in private hospitals was 10% under case 2 and further expanded to 30% under case-3",

India has a total (public +private) bed capacity of 2,363,296 which can be allocated for COVID-19 infections according to existing bed occupancy rate and government guidelines. The availability of health care infrastructure which is collected from multiple sources is presented in Table 4 . According to Case-1 where no allocation is made by private sector and only 10% resources are dedicated in public infrastructure, actual availability of hospital beds, ICU beds and ventilators is 101,131, 5,322 and 2,661 respectively. The estimated inflow/outflow of mild, severe and critical cases per day are 9193, 266 and 133. Under this scenario, India has the capacity to accommodate only 33,870 mild cases, 1,067 severe and critical new COVID cases every day. However, leveraging upon expansive private health care system in India can bolster the capacity. The tipping point for beds and ventilators increases significantly when 10% (case 2) and 30% (case 3) private health care resources were assumed to earmarked to accommodate COVID-19 patients. For example, under case-2, we found that the surge capacity of health system for mild, severe and critical care is distinctly higher than case 1 as can be seen in Figure 3 and Figure 4 .

Green coloured boxes are indicative of the availability of infrastructure during peak time in respective scenarios, whereas non-green coloured boxes suggest the extent of health infrastructure that has to be upgraded to meet the real demand during peak time.

However, increasing the testing even further to 500,000, number of ICU beds must double, and supply of ventilators must be increased by 33.7% before 17 th July. Therefore, necessary steps must be made to include private-sector hospitals in the treatment of COVID-19 patients in order to be prepared for the widespread community transmission and increase in detected cases due to aggressive testing.

            "text": "One of the important finding of our analysis is relative ineffectiveness of further extending the strict lockdown measures, as full lockdown is likely to push the surge in demand for hospital resources by a month without suppressing the total number of cases significantly. India was amongst the countries to implement lockdown early with highest stringency in the world which is also indicated by the stringency index of lockdown (100% for India) prepared by University of Oxford (20) . Due to the high costs of lockdowns, there's a policy conundrum if the countries should quarantine everyone at a large social cost or test everyone and apply quarantine in a more directed fashion. The increase in documented cases with augmented testing in our study suggests that lockdown should be replaced gradually with more thrust on public health intervention of testing, tracing and isolating in conjunction with surveillance and real time data. More targeted sequestering of infected case(both symptomatic and asymptomatic) aided with increased random testing, along-with the social distancing measures for containment zones with higher incidence of cases and isolating vulnerable with underlying conditions and aged population is recommended rather than stringent lockdown in order to prevent the negative shock from deepening further.",

There is some capacity available for mild cases, provided documented cases are constrained by testing capacity, albeit, in an event of expanded testing and community transmission, mild cases will also be subjected to deficit of beds. The shortage of beds for even mild and asymptomatic cases can be corroborated with the recent reports from Indian cities of Chennai (21) and Mumbai (22) where government hospitals are running out of beds due to explosion of cases. Many countries are resorting to home isolation of mild and asymptomatic cases, a measure which Union Health Ministry of Indian government has also announced recently. However, we recommend to ramp up institutional capacity to isolate infected cases under institutional care as India's congested housing conditions are not conducive to quarantining at home. The National Sample Survey Office data (23) reveals that for 60% Indians, per capita space available is less than a single room leading to unprecedented challenges for effective home isolation.",

Age-distributed data on severe, critical and recovered cases is rather sparse in India, therefore, we adapted/estimated some parameters from detailed data released by other countries. Modelling is rather a necessary input to guide policy decisions, however, a more comprehensive approach incorporating stakeholder's analysis, case studies and triangulating information across multitude of sources should be adapted for nuanced decision making. The study can be further extended to map the geographical accessibility of facilities providing COVID-19 care, specifically spatial accessibility for critical care needs to be explored. Also, rapid health facility assessments for COVID-19 preparedness unravelling mean availability of tracer items for emergency response should be conducted for targeted interventions at hospital level. Finally, study can be extended at more granular level to inform demand-supply gap so that resources can be mobilized in commensuration with demand at more local level, thereby enabling local government systems to combat COVID-19 in India.",
