Pulmonary diseases are mainly caused by trauma, air pollution, smoking, and various pathogens and exert a devastating effect on quality of life [1]. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), recognized as the most severe form of acute lung injury (ALI), is a life-threatening condition featuring acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, bilateral consolidation on chest radiograph, and absence of left atrial hypertension [2, 3]. ARDS most commonly occurs due to sepsis, smoke inhalation injury, near-drowning, severe pneumonia, or pulmonary contusion [3\u20136]. Mechanistic studies reveal that dysregulated inflammatory/immune responses, uncontrolled activation of coagulation pathways, and increased permeability of alveolar endothelial/epithelial barrier play pivotal roles in the pathogenesis of ARDS [3]. ARDS continues to be associated with a mortality rate of 30% to 40% despite advances in modern supportive care [2, 4, 7\u20139].",

Among the various types of stem cells, the therapeutic potential of mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) has been extensively demonstrated in several animal models of pulmonary disorders [10\u201315], and is now being evaluated in phase II clinical trials for ARDS [16]. It is well established that MSCs impart their therapeutic effect via secretion of bioactive products, namely the secretome [17, 18]. Although not fully defined, the MSC secretome is comprised of an extended array of bioactive molecules that include cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, angiogenic factors, and extracellular vesicles (EVs), thus potentially contributing to the therapeutic benefits of the cells as evident from preclinical studies [19\u201323]. MSC secretome is readily available in the conditioned media (CM) of MSC cultures (MSC-CM) and, subsequently, MSC-derived EVs are isolated from the CM. The major advantage of MSC-derived secretome therapy over live-cell transplantation approach can be attributed to the inherent risks associated with live-cell transplants. Consequently, the MSC secretome is emerging as a viable option to replace the cells for the treatment of several lung disorders.",

            "text": "In 1968, Friedenstein and colleagues first discovered MSCs as a component of bone-marrow stromal tissue [24]. Subsequently, MSCs have been isolated from various tissues, such as adipose tissue, umbilical cord (UC) blood/tissue, placental tissue, and exfoliated deciduous teeth [25\u201329]. Since no unique surface marker(s) can exclusively identify these cells, in 2006, the Mesenchymal and Tissue Stem Cell Committee of the International Society for Cellular Therapy proposed the following criteria as minimal criteria to be satisfied for defining human MSCs. First, the cells must be plastic-adherent when maintained in standard culture conditions. Second, MSCs must express surface antigens such as CD105, CD73, and CD90 but should lack the expression of the following hematopoietic antigens: CD45, CD34, CD14 or CD11b, CD79a or CD19, and human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DR. Third, MSCs must be capable of differentiating into osteoblasts, adipocytes, and chondroblasts in vitro [30]. That MSCs are easy to isolate and expand in culture is a major advantage from a logistical/feasibility standpoint. More importantly, MSCs have evolved as one of the mainstream cell-based therapeutic tools for regenerative medicine because of their inherent low immunogenicity and limited risk of tumorigenicity [29, 31, 32].",

            "text": "Structurally, EVs are nano- to micro-sized particles surrounded by a phospholipid bilayer. Most eukaryotes and prokaryotes have been shown to secrete a heterogeneous population of EVs. The presence of these vesicles can be detected in physiological fluids, such as plasma, urine, cerebrospinal fluid, milk as well as in the supernatant of cell cultures in vitro [53\u201355]. Of note, EVs were considered as cell debris [53, 55\u201357] till 1996 when Raposo et al. [58] presented evidence of their biological function. They demonstrated that EVs secreted by B lymphocytes can induce antigen-specific T lymphocyte responses in vitro. The pioneering observation by these authors prompted elaborate studies to establish the role of EVs as critical mediators in cell-to-cell communication [53, 57, 59\u201361]. Cumulative studies in the field reveal that upon their release into the extracellular milieu, EVs can interact with recipient cells by ligand-receptor interaction or by internalization via endocytosis, phagocytosis, and direct membrane fusion (Fig. 1). Targeted delivery of EVs to specific cells/tissues is facilitated by several types of membrane molecules that are embedded in the lipid bilayers. Interestingly, several studies reported the ability of EVs to regulate a variety of biological responses in recipient cells via transfer of an array of bioactive factors that include proteins, lipids, nucleic acids (mRNA, microRNA, transfer RNA, and double-stranded DNAs), as well as cellular organelles [41, 53, 57]. At present, based on their cellular origin, secretory mechanism, size, and surface markers, EVs are classified into 3 main categories 1) exosomes; 2) microvesicles; and 3) apoptotic bodies.",

Similarly, both ubiquitous and MSC-specific proteins and nucleic acids are enveloped in these EVs (Fig. 1). Interestingly, certain proteins and nucleic acids are selectively enriched in EVs compared to their parental cells. For instance, Collino and colleagues [2010] identified that while microvesicles derived from bone marrow MSCs contain their parental cell-specific microRNAs (miR), the expression level of some was significantly higher in microvesicles compared to MSCs (miR-223, miR-451, and miR-564) [68]. It has also been shown that horizontal transfer of functional RNAs and proteins is involved in general cell functions, such as cell development, proliferation, survival, and differentiation, as well as regulation of the immune system [18], angiogenesis [69], and ATP generation [70]. Unequivocally, interest in exploring the therapeutic potential of MSC-EVs has evolved; however, at this stage, further investigation is warranted in regards to the unveiling of the composite profile of the contents of these vesicles and the elucidation of the potential therapeutic efficacy of these components.",

            "text": "MSC-CM is considered the least processed cell-free product from MSCs. Based on the source of MSCs, culture condition, culture duration, and collection method, different quantities of secreted factors may be detected in the CM [50]. Generally, MSCs are cultured in their growth media as monolayers or aggregates. Once cells reach approximately 80% confluence, serum-containing growth media are replaced with fresh media [36, 47, 49, 50, 71]. In order to decrease contamination of the CM by extrinsic sources, such as fetal bovine serum, serum-free media are commonly used at this step [57]. On the other hand, chemically defined media or EV-depleted serum containing media are suggested to reduce the effect of nutrition starvation on MSCs [72]. As previously mentioned, environmental signals influence the paracrine activity of MSCs; therefore, the cells can be exposed to different stimuli, including hypoxia or pro-inflammatory cytokines to promote the secretion of certain therapeutic molecules in vitro. At the end of the incubation period (commonly 24\u201348 h), the supernatant is collected from the MSC cultures. The cellular component is subsequently removed by density-gradient centrifugation or filtration. At this step, the cell-free product is considered MSC-CM. It is optional to concentrate MSC-CM before in vitro and in vivo applications. Following preparation, the CM can be stored at \u2212 80 \u00b0C or subsequently processed for EV isolation.",

            "text": "There are several approaches to determine the yield of the MSC-CM. One of the most common approaches is based on the number of MSCs from which the CM was derived [47, 71, 73\u201376]. Other parameters, including total proteins and the concentration of certain soluble bioactive mediators, have also been considered for characterization and dosage determination of MSC-CM [46, 49, 50, 77]. A variety of techniques may be used to isolate and concentrate different fractions (e.g., exosomes or microvesicles) of EVs from CM; these include ultracentrifugation, filtration and chromatography, precipitation, and immuno-affinity [78]. Each method provides different degrees of purity and enrichment; however, none of the available methods can completely separate the different types of EVs from each other or from non-EV fractions (e.g. soluble proteins, cell-free nucleic acids, and membrane fractions). Combinations of two or more methods may be used to improve the purity of certain fractions of EVs. Assessment of isolated EVs is mainly done by determination of concentration and size distributions using different methods, such as nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA), transmission electron microscopy, and flow cytometry. In addition, the amount of total proteins in EVs is commonly assessed and used to select EV dosage for in vitro and in vivo studies. Similar to CM, the concentration of EVs or their total protein can be normalized to the number of MSCs from which they are derived. The final product can further be concentrated and stored for short periods at 4 \u00b0C. For longer storage, EVs can be placed in \u2264 \u2212 20 \u00b0C without the need of cryopreservatives.",

MSC-CM also reduced the adhesion of leukocytes to endothelial cells, thus suggesting that MSC-CM can moderate the inflammatory response of the injured endothelium by preserving vascular barrier integrity and preventing inflammatory cell binding to endothelial cells [79]. In another in vitro study, Ortiz et al. demonstrated the capability of MSC-CM to reduce the secretion of TNF-\u03b1 by macrophages.

The idea of such experimental studies stemmed from the notion that impaired alveolar fluid clearance is associated with higher mortality in ARDS patients. In this study, the therapeutic benefits of MSCs and MSC-CM were evaluated by the extent of their ability to restore alveolar fluid clearance in ALI. The experimental design consisted of delivery of Escherichia coli (E. coli) endotoxin intra-bronchially to perfused lungs, followed by the administration of MSCs or MSC-CM one hour following induction of injury. Both treatments improved lung endothelial barrier integrity and the rate of alveolar fluid transport. This study also revealed the essential role of keratinocyte growth factor (KGF), a MSC component, in alveolar fluid transport. MSC pretreatment with KGF small-interference RNA (siRNA) decreased the effect of MSC-CM on alveolar fluid clearance. Conversely, this effect was restored by the addition of recombinant KGF protein to the CM [80].",

In this pursuit, Ionescu et al. showed that intratracheal (IT) administration of MSCs or MSC-CM reduced the total number of infiltrated neutrophils in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) in mice with endotoxin-induced ALI. Of note, the administration of fibroblasts or fibroblast-CM did not reproduce the same effect thus demonstrating MSC specificity. Concurrently, the flow-cytometric analysis revealed that MSC and MSC-CM administration increased the percentage of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS)-Ym1+ alveolar macrophages in BALF, resembling the phenotype associated with alternatively activated macrophages (M2). Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) was detected in MSC-CM, suggesting its role in polarization of alveolar macrophages to the M2 phenotype and protection of lungs from endotoxin-induced injury [74]. In another study, Devaney and colleagues reported that intravenous (IV) and IT administration of MSCs reduced the infiltration of neutrophils, IL-6, and the total amount of protein in BALF in a rat model of E. coli-induced pneumonia. MSCs also improved survival and bacterial clearance and preserved lung function. In contrast, MSC-CM improved animal survival without any significant mitigation of the severity of lung injury or inflammation [81]. Experimental evidence on the studies addressing the anti-inflammatory potential of MSC-CM revealed that MSC-CM pretreatment significantly reduced the amount of pro-inflammatory cytokines and the number of infiltrated neutrophils in BALF in a rat model of ischemia-reperfusion lung injury. In addition, the number of M2-like macrophages and T-regulatory lymphocytes in BALF fluid was increased in MSC-CM pretreated rats [82].",

            "text": "Additionally, the beneficial role of MSC-CM in protecting lung tissue from hyperoxia was studied in several small animal models of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). BPD and consequent pulmonary hypertension are serious complications in premature infants caused by mechanical ventilation and oxygen toxicity. As reported by Aslam and colleagues hyperoxia-induced BPD in neonatal mice can be prevented by IV administration of concentrated mouse MSC-CM similar to MSC treatment. This study also revealed that early administration of MSC-CM significantly decreased right ventricular hypertrophy and muscularization of intrapulmonary arterioles as well as preserved the number of alveoli with normal morphology in neonatal mice exposed to hyperoxia. In parallel, MSC-CM treatment was shown to dramatically reduce the number of inflammatory cells and cytokine levels in BALF of injured mice. Another important finding was reflected in the identification of two immunomodulatory molecules, osteopontin (Spp1 or Opn) and macrophage-colony-stimulating factor 1 (M-CSF or Csf1), exclusively present in higher extent in the MSC-CM. This suggests their plausible role in the therapeutic benefits of MSC-CM [71]. In a separate study from the same group, Hansmann observed that MSC-CM could also reverse the adverse effects of long-term exposure to hyperoxia on lung morphology and function [84]. With a view to identifying the mechanisms by which MSC-CM function, Tropea et al. observed that systemic administration of MSCs and their CM increased the number of bronchoalveolar stem cells (BASCs) in terminal bronchioles of lungs of neonatal mice 10 days post administration. Similarly, MSC-CM enhanced BASC colony growth in vitro; however, supplementation of BASC cultures with growth factors known to be present in MSC-CM (VEGF, HGF, KGF, or basic FGF) did not show a similar effect, thus ruling out the association of these MSC components in enhanced BASC colony growth [85]. It is noteworthy that the effect of daily administration of human MSC-CM, intraperitoneally, was observed to be comparable with a single administration of MSCs in protecting neonatal rats from BPD and pulmonary hypertension [86]. Since culture conditions can influence the secretion pattern of MSCs, Waszak and colleagues examined the effect of hyperoxia on the therapeutic potential of preconditioned MSC-CM in a rat model of BPD. Preconditioning MSCs under 95% O2 improved therapeutic benefits of the CM compared with control MSC-CM or lung fibroblast-CM. Correlatively, the preconditioned MSC-CM was also shown to contain a higher amount of STC-1 [87], which is a pleiotropic protein with antioxidant, anti-apoptotic, and anti-inflammatory potential [37, 88\u201390].",

The MSC-EVs mediated an anti-inflammatory effect by reducing the influx of lung macrophages and early inflammatory mediators. MSC-EV treatment also abrogated the hypoxia-induced phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT-3), which plays a critical role in the response of pulmonary vasculature to hypoxia [20].

MSC-EVs were as effective as their parent cells in preventing pulmonary hypertension [98]. Similarly, IV administration of either mouse or human MSC-EVs was shown to reduce right ventricular hypertrophy and pulmonary vascular remodeling in monocrotaline-treated mice. Administration of the exosome fraction of MSC-EVs exerted higher therapeutic response compared to the microvesicle fraction.

The use of CM or EVs may circumvent many of the safety concerns associated with the use of live cells, such as thrombogenicity. Also, unlike cells, CM and EVs are not able to proliferate or reprogram after administration, which decreases the risk of tumorigenicity [106\u2013108]. From a therapeutic standpoint, MSC-EVs and other bioactive mediators are smaller than their parent cells, and thus might be distributed more efficiently into the lungs and other organs.",

Based on this concept, MSC-EVs are considered efficient vehicles for transporting delicate bioactive mediators to the distal airways. It is also thought that MSC-EVs can be used to deliver specific drugs to target organs. Such drugs can be delivered to EVs via MSCs that overexpress those factors, or can be loaded directly to the EVs after they have been released by the cells. Examples of different types of therapeutic cargo include siRNAs for silencing target genes and chemotherapeutic drugs, such as doxorubicin [109, 110].",

Another great advantage is that CM and EVs can also be stored for several months at \u2212 20 \u00b0C to \u2212 80 \u00b0C without the need for cryopreservatives, unlike their parent cells [111]. Notably, cryopreservatives, such as dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), can be cytotoxic and have been reported to lyse EVs [112].

A growing number of studies have identified some of the key mediators in MSC-CM and EVs; however, there is a variability in the content of the secretome due to several factors. These include donor\u2019s condition (age, sex, and health status), the type of MSCs (e.g. bone marrow, adipose, or UC), the type of culture (flask or bioreactor), the type of media and supplements (e.g., fetal bovine serum, xeno-free, or chemically-defined media), and the microenvironment (e.g. oxygen tension and presence or absence of stress signals) [16, 104, 111]. Also, post-processing of CM and EVs (e.g. CM concentration and EV enrichment) as well as handling and storage can influence their quality [111]. Furthermore, various factors (e.g. methods of EV enrichment and storage) could influence the quantity of EVs present in the final product [104], making it difficult to estimate EV yield per MSC. In light of these limitations, it is essential to develop a series of potency assays for cell-free products in order to control their quality and quantity, and to predict their efficacy in vivo.",

In order to produce sufficient pools of MSCs, the cells need to be expanded in vitro for several population doublings. Although MSCs have been shown to be safe for up to 40 population doublings [16], it is important to frequently inspect them for cell senescence and chromosome instability, and eliminate defective cells. To overcome the low yield of MSCs and their products from primary cultures, genetic modification, such as immortalization, can be considered [113]. In addition, the technology to obtain CM and EVs from MSCs derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC-MSCs) might be beneficial [111, 114]. iPSC-MSCs have robust proliferation and differentiation capacities and can be generated either from allogeneic sources or patients [114]. These alternative approaches could also facilitate establishing universal donors to minimize donor-to-donor variability and produce large-scales of CM and EVs with consistent quality. The use of autologous MSCs and their products may be considered when allogeneic products are not available, especially in remote and austere conditions. However, since the effect of different disorders on endogenous stem cells and their products is not completely understood [16, 111], the application of autologous-based products needs to be carefully assessed.",
