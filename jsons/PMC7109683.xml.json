We recruited adults with and without asthma by advertising on a community Web site (craigslist; http://sfbay.craigslist.org/), by posting flyers on campus, and by sending e-mail messages to subjects who had responded to previous advertisements for research studies. Participant recruitment started in the fall of 2001 and extended through the end of December 2004. The announcements requested that subjects contact us within 48 h of the onset of \u201ccold\u201d symptoms. We evaluated subjects first within 1\u20133 days of cold onset (visit 1), then again between days 4 and 7 of cold symptoms (visit 2), and at 6 weeks or longer thereafter to assess baseline status (visit 3). Eighty-three subjects were enrolled; 53 had asthma, and 30 did not. Asthma was defined as a history of asthma symptoms (recurrent dyspnea, wheezing, and chest tightness) associated with a positive methacholine test result [8]. Subjects without asthma had neither a history of asthma symptoms nor a positive methacholine test result. All were informed of the purposes, procedures, and risks of participating, and all signed informed-consent forms approved by the University of California, San Francisco, Committee of Human Research.",

Spirometry measurements (forced expired volume in 1 s [FEV1] and forced vital capacity [FVC]) were obtained, and the percentage predicted was calculated using Crapo equations. Nasal lavage (NL) was then performed by instilling 5 mL of warmed normal saline into each nostril and, after a 20-s dwell time, having the subject expel the nasal contents into a plastic cup. Subjects with asthma recorded symptom severity and a.m. and p.m. peak flow measurements (AirWatch; iMetrikus) in a diary twice daily for 7 days after visit 1 and 7 days before visit 3. The visit procedures were repeated at day 5\u20137 and at baseline (6 weeks or longer) after the onset of cold symptoms.",

A.K., who was blinded to the viral culture isolation and HRV PCR results, interpreted the hybridization signatures. Epredict, a computational tool developed for the Virochip array hybridization signature, was used to determine the Virochip results, with the P value cutoff for positivity set at .05, as described elsewhere [25]. Samples for which multiple viruses met this threshold were further evaluated by hierarchical cluster analysis of sum-normalized background-subtracted array hybridization intensities from all NL specimens, by use of Cluster software (version 3) [26]. Co-occurrence of samples within clusters was used to make calls for specimens that either had multiple significant Epredict scores or had no significant Epredict scores.

Moreover, pairwise sequence identity between the HRV\u2018X\u2019 genomes was much lower than that detected among the fully sequenced HRVA or HRVB subgroup genomes (data not shown). Taken together, these data demonstrate that these HRV\u2018X\u2019 isolates correspond to a novel divergent subgroup of HRV and suggest that this divergent branch of HRV\u2018X\u2019 isolates may possess a higher level of genetic diversity than seen previously in the HRVA and HRVB subgroups.",

We find that, like PCR, the Virochip technology is superior to standard culture isolation methods for detection of viral pathogens. Moreover, the Virochip exhibits comparable sensitivity and specificity to pathogen-specific PCR. On the whole, the distribution and proportion of distinct viral pathogens detected by the Virochip agrees with previous PCR-based analyses of viral pathogens associated with upper RTIs and those accompanied by exacerbation of asthma symptoms [3, 38]. However, Virochip analysis has allowed us to uncover a remarkable amount of diversity among the viral pathogens in this relatively small study population. This diversity indicates that future studies that seek to link a particular virus or set of viruses to a discrete clinical outcome, such as exacerbation of asthma symptoms, will need to include large numbers of subjects and use pan-viral detection methods (such as the Virochip) that can differentiate among such isolates.",

First, the diversity and distribution of HCoVs detected in the present study were surprising. The 2 more recently described HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 were the predominant HCoVs rather than HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-229E, which have been traditionally implicated in up to 15% of common colds in the US adult population [32]. Here, instead we see HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 making up approximately that same proportion of colds detected in our study population. Given that HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 have not been implicated previously as significant players in outpatient respiratory tract illnesses among immunocompetent adults in the United States [39, 40], these results were unexpected. No HCoV-229E isolates and only a single HCoV-OC43 isolate were detected in this study group, despite the fact that independent studies with the Virochip have demonstrated that, when present, both HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-229E are readily detectable (C. Y. Chiu, A. Urisman, T. L. Greenhow, submitted). Further analysis will be required to determine whether the patterns of HCoVs detected here reflect an increased susceptibility of adults with asthma to contract these HCoVs, the arrival of a local outbreak of these HCoV types, or an actual shift in the prevalence of the distinct HCoVs circulating in the US adult population.",

[43]. However, the VP4 sequences in the other 4 HRV\u2018X\u2019 strains identified here possess <85% nucleotide sequence identity with the set of divergent HRVs identified by Lamson et al. [43]. The identification of 2 distinct sets of genetically divergent HRV clinical isolates indicates that the set of previously unrecognized HRVs currently circulating in the United States may be quite large. A deeper knowledge of the extent of the current HRV diversity should informfuture studies of the role played by HRV strains in asthma exacerbations, given that a high proportion of such events are attributable to infection by these agents.",
