They need time out of the cage for exercise and mental stimulation. Ferrets should be allowed to play in a ferret-proof area for several hours daily, and this time can be divided throughout the day. In their cage, ferrets should have a retreat for sleeping, in the form of a cloth tube, hammock, or tent. Ferrets can be trained to use a litter box\u2014a corner box works well because they like to back up into corners to defecate. Litter boxes should be close and easily accessed, as ferrets have a short gastrointestinal transit time and may not make it to a litter box in another room or area of the house.",

For some elderly ferrets affected by multiple diseases, a smaller one-story cage may be safer.",

            "text": "Ferrets are strict carnivores. They have a short gastrointestinal tract that empties in 3 to 4 hours. Due to diminished gastrointestinal flora and few brush border enzymes, they do not metabolize carbohydrates well.1 They also have difficulty digesting fiber. They require diets high in good-quality animal protein and fat with minimal carbohydrates and fiber. Excess carbohydrates may lead to pancreatic disease, such as insulinoma. Treats that are acceptable include pieces of chicken, eggs, and other high-protein snacks. Ferrets develop their dietary preferences in the first few months of age, so it is important that they be started on an appropriate diet early.1 Changing an adult or older ferret's diet can be challenging. A whole prey diet has been advocated by many authorities and is fed in some areas of the world. In the United States, a good-quality dry ferret or kitten diet is recommended to aid in prevention of dental disease. As ferrets age, a switch to a senior ferret diet should be considered. Several geriatric diets are available. Weight loss, emaciation, and muscle wasting can occur in older ferrets. Long-term anorexia can lead to hepatic lipidosis. More frequent feedings and assisted feedings may be necessary in sick or senior ferrets (Fig. 1\n).",

Many ferrets can be restrained for venipuncture without sedation or anesthesia. For jugular venipuncture, the technique used in cats, with head tilted back and forelegs pulled forward over the edge of a table, works well. The jugular vein in ferrets is slightly more lateral than in cats or dogs. For the cranial vena cava approach, a ferret is held on its back with its front legs pulled caudally and the head and neck extended. A 25-gauge needle is inserted into the thoracic cavity between the manubrium and first rib at a 45\u00b0 angle, pointing the needle toward the opposite rear leg. The needle is inserted to its hub, then slowly withdrawn while gently applying suction until blood begins to fill the syringe. For difficult or fractious ferrets, the author routinely masks them down with isoflurane or sevoflurane briefly to obtain the sample. Isoflurane anesthesia can reduce the hematocrit level, red blood cell count, and hemoglobin concentrations so be sure to note that the sample is taken with the ferret under anesthesia in the evaluation of the blood sample.4\n",

These findings suggest that cobalamin malabsorption is common in ferrets with chronic diarrhea and that it can be severe enough to cause increases in serum methylmalonic acid concentrations indicating tissue depletion of cobalamin. Although only a few ferrets have been followed after cobalamin therapy, the preliminary results suggest that cobalamin therapy is helpful in treatment of chronic diarrhea in ferrets.14 The author's current recommendations are extrapolated from cobalamin therapy in cats: cobalamin (250 \u03bcg subcutaneously per ferret weekly for 6 weeks, then 250 \u03bcg every 2 weeks for 6 weeks, then monthly). Cobalamin levels should be re-evaluated 1 month after the last administration. Monthly injections may be necessary in chronic intestinal disease.14\n",

In the United States, ferrets are neutered at a few weeks of age, are housed indoors, and are on formulated diets. European ferrets are neutered later, often housed outdoors, and are fed a whole prey diet. A recent article revealed that when ferrets are neutered at a later age in Europe they too develop adrenal disease, indicating that it does not appear to be the age of neutering but the act of neutering that results in disease.16\n",

With progression of the disease, increasing doses of prednisone are needed. Diazoxide is a benzothiadiazide diuretic that inhibits release of insulin from the beta cells, promotes gluconeogenesis, and decreases cellular uptake of glucose. Diazoxide should be added to the medical protocol when prednisone alone is no longer effective. The dosage for diazoxide is 10 to 30 mg/kg every 12 hours, beginning at the low end of the range and increasing the dose as needed.9 Often the dose of prednisone can be reduced with the addition of diazoxide. Diazoxide is expensive and cost prohibitive for some owners.",

The cause is unknown, although genetics and dietary factors have been discussed as potential etiologies.32 They can occasionally occur in young ferrets but more commonly occur in older ferrets. Because they progress slowly, ferrets adapt to diminished vision and owners may not readily notice anything and may even believe that acute blindness has occurred after a sudden change in a ferret's environment. Ferrets adapt well to cataract-induced blindness and manage well in home environments. Cataract surgery is an option, and phacoemulsification and extracapsular extraction have been performed successfully.46\n",

There are several potential causes of splenomegaly, including neoplasia, hypersplenism, heart disease, and extramedullary hematopoiesis, the latter being the most common cause of splenomegaly in ferrets.31 With extramedullary hematopoiesis, the spleen appears large but smooth in texture. Splenomegaly associated with lymphoma or other neoplastic processes is often nodular and white or tan nodules may be present.47 Splenomegaly is often an incidental finding on physical examination, during ultrasound, or at surgery or necropsy. Often the spleen is large and easily palpated. If pathology is suspected, ultrasound-guided aspiration or aspiration through the abdominal wall can be performed relatively safely. Splenectomy should not be performed unless there is documented pathology or the spleen has become so large it is impairing mobility of a ferret (Fig. 8\n).47\n",

Clients have often spent many hours caring for their elderly pet, strengthening this bond even further. This can make euthanasia a difficult decision for owners. Determining when the time is right to euthanize can be challenging. Discussing the quality of life of ferrets is important in helping owners determine if that time has come. Is the pet able to get around on its own? Is it eating? Is the pet playful or able to enjoy interactions with the client? Are there more good days than bad? Often owners ask if it is better to allow a pet to die at home or be humanely euthanized. If the animal is not in pain or suffering and has an adequate quality of life, keeping the pet home and allowing it to die of \u201cold age\u201d may be an option. But often these animals have debilitating disease and may have multiple diseases present that are uncomfortable if not painful to the animal. It is veterinarians' responsibility to discuss with clients the option of euthanasia as an alternative to days or weeks of suffering. Euthanasia can be a painless, gentle end to a long, happy life for many pets. Owners can be allowed to be present with their pet. Presedation may be necessary in some pets, and placement of an intravenous catheter reduces stress for the client and the pet. If euthanasia is chosen, offering burial or cremation services is often appreciated by grieving owners, as are remembrance items, such as clay paws and locks of hair.",
