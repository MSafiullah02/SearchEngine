            "text": "One of the most common causes of illness in the human population by far arises from respiratory tract infections [1]. Ventilator-associated pneumonia is the most frequent nosocomial infection in intensive care units. Due to millions of physician visits, hospitalizations and lost work hours, the economic cost of respiratory infections runs into hundreds of billions each year [1], [2], [3]. For influenza epidemics alone in the USA, the total annual economic burden using projected statistical life values is approximately $87.1 billion [4]. Important human pathogenic organisms responsible for respiratory infections include bacteria (e.g. Pseudomonas aeruginosa), fungi (e.g. Aspergillus spp.), and viruses (e.g. respiratory syncytial virus, and influenza virus), all of which have a high cumulative burden of morbidity and economic losses [5]. Inhaled anti-infective drugs play a pivotal role in the prophylaxis and treatment of these common respiratory infections. The most effective treatment involves aerosolized drug administration that delivers the anti-infective agent directly to the respiratory tract, thereby achieving drug concentrations sufficient to eradicate the pathogenic organisms at the site of infection. Importantly, aerosolized administration greatly reduces potential toxicity associated with systemic exposure. The primary mode for aerosolized pulmonary delivery of anti-infective agents is via nebulization, using jet systems, ultrasonic systems, and other systems that use a vibrating mesh/aperture plate [6].",

Tobramycin is mainly indicated for treatment of serious infections caused by Gram-negative bacteria and is often reserved for serious infections that are resistant to other antibacterials [14]. From the SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program, the incidence of aminoglycoside resistance in clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa for tobramycin was 31.6% in Europe and 7.8% in the United States [15].",

The recommended dose for adults and children above 6 years old is 300 mg twice daily for 28 days, stop for 28 days, then repeat the cycle [18], [19]. The nebulization procedure usually takes about 10\u201315 min. The major adverse effects (Table 1) that have been reported with nebulization of tobramycin include bronchospasm, voice alteration and transient tinnitus (without hearing loss) [17]. Tobramycin solution for inhalation (300 mg in 5 mL twice a day) was shown to give a mean peak sputum concentration of 1237 \u03bcg/g at 10 min after inhalation of the first and last dose in a 20-week study period, with a mean serum concentration of 0.95 \u03bcg/mL [20]. There was no accumulation of tobramycin in the sputum or serum over the course of the study. Interestingly, the estimated systemic bioavailability after nebulization was only 11.7% [20]. Hence, nebulized tobramycin substantially increased the therapeutic ratio over that of parenteral administration; the latter can cause nephrotoxicity (up to 10\u201325% [21]) and ototoxicity (2\u201345% in adults and up to 2% in infants [22]) in patients. A recent study which carried out a retrospective analysis of the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Patient Registry (CFFPR) (1996\u20132008) reported that after regression adjustment, the use of tobramycin inhalation solution was associated with 21% reduction in the odds of subsequent year mortality in patients with CF [23].",

A recent study examined the difference in pharmacokinetic and tolerability profiles when tobramycin solution (300 mg in 4 mL) was administered by PARI eFLOW\u00ae rapid, as compared to those with a PARI LC\u00ae PLUS nebulizer. The maximum sputum concentration of tobramycin for the eFLOW (518.6 \u03bcg/g) was higher than for the LC\u00ae PLUS (381.9 \u03bcg/g) on day 28. Furthermore, administration time was reduced from 13 min to only 5 min with the eFLOW\u00ae\n[26]. This is important in order to address poor compliance and total treatment burden.",

This may affect patient compliance and strategies to overcome non-adherence need to be addressed. Recently, a dry powder inhalation (DPI) form of tobramycin was developed and approved (TOBI\u00ae Podhaler\u00ae) [28]. DPIs are convenient as the devices are much smaller and portable. They also take less time to use and do not require special cleaning. However, unlike nebulizers, inspiratory effort of patients generally affects the delivery of the dose from DPIs [27]. TOBI Podhaler\u00ae was developed using the PulmoSphere\u2122 technology [29]. Tobramycin dry powder is placed in capsules (28 mg tobramycin per capsule) and used via the TOBI Podhaler\u00ae inhaler device [28]. The recommended dose for patients aged 6 years and older is 4 capsules (112 mg tobramycin) twice a day for 28 days, stopping for 28 days followed by a new treatment cycle [28]. A study in CF patients showed that similar pharmacokinetics was observed between 300 mg tobramycin inhalation solution used with the PARI LC\u00ae PLUS nebulizer and 4 capsules of tobramycin DPI (total of 112 mg) using the TOBI\u00ae Podhaler\u00ae\n[30]. In sputum both formulations achieved the maximum concentration (Cmax) at 0.5 h after the inhalation [30]. The DPI formulation is delivered much more efficiently than with nebulized inhalation solutions [30].",

There was also a decrease in the density of P. aeruginosa cells in their sputum, fewer hospitalizations related to respiratory events, and used fewer concomitant anti-pseudomonal antibiotics than their peers receiving placebo even in the first treatment period [31]. Another recent Phase-III study demonstrated that in terms of efficacy, tobramycin inhalation powder was not inferior to tobramycin inhalation solution with respect to lung function benefit [32]. The safety profiles of both formulations were also similar [32]. There was, however, a higher incidence of cough reported in patients receiving tobramycin inhalation powder as compared to nebulized tobramycin (48% compared to 31%) [33]. In terms of intensity, most cough events were mild or moderate in both groups. Dysphonia and dysgeusia also occurred at a higher frequency in the tobramycin inhalation powder group compared to the nebulized tobramycin group [32].",

CMS nebulizer solution has been approved in Europe, including the United Kingdom, since 2003 for treatment of respiratory infections caused by P. aeruginosa in CF patients [68], and is included in the European guideline on inhaled medications in CF [69]. In fact, nebulized CMS (for 3 weeks with oral ciprofloxacin) has been widely used in CF patients since the 1990s as an early aggressive chemotherapy when P. aeruginosa is detected in the sputum [70].

A Phase-III study compared the DPI formulation of CMS with tobramycin solution for inhalation (300 mg in 5 mL) over 24 weeks [83]. The results demonstrated that Colobreathe\u00ae was effective and non-inferior to nebulized tobramycin. The adjusted mean difference between Colobreathe\u00ae and tobramycin inhalation solution in FEV1% predicted at week 24 was \u2212 0.98% (95% CI \u2212 2.74%, 0.866%) in the intention-to-treat population (n = 373). Susceptibility testing was carried out and concentrations of colistin in sputum were approximately 20 times the MICs of the causative pathogens.

It has been reported that liposomes can infiltrate biofilm thereby maximizing bacterial killing and minimizing any potential emergence of resistance [94]. Furthermore, the liposome formulation slows the release of drugs which may reduce the dosing frequency and provide PK/PD benefits. A Phase-II study showed that a 560 mg once daily dose improved lung function and decreased the sputum density of P. aeruginosa\n[93]. Amikacin is also used to treat non-tuberculosis mycobacteria (NTM) in CF patients [95]. Non-liposomal amikacin has been studied as an adjunct therapy in patients with treatment-refractory pulmonary NTM disease, showing an improvement in clinical symptoms and microbiological outcomes [96]. Unfortunately, it was not well tolerated; out of the 20 patients, 35% stopped due to adverse effects such as ototoxicity, hemoptysis, nephrotoxicity, persistent dysphonia, and vertigo [96]. A nebulized liposomal formulation is currently undergoing a Phase-II study against Mycobacterium avium and M. abscessus\n[97]. A Phase-II, placebo controlled, randomized study investigated nebulized liposomal amikacin in non-CF bronchiectasis patients [98]. The study showed that inhalation of liposomal amikacin once daily was safe and well tolerated [98]. Patients receiving the higher dose (560 mg) did have a slightly higher frequency of dry cough as compared to patients receiving 280 mg, however, no cases of nephrotoxicity or ototoxicity were reported [98]. A randomized controlled trial showed similar efficacy of nebulized amikacin and intravenous ceftazidime for treatment of VAP caused by P. aeruginosa and that nebulized amikacin is effective even against intermediate strains [99].",

Oropharyngeal irritation depends on the specific chemical nature and the mass of drug deposited on the oropharynx, and may be alleviated by reducing oropharyngeal deposition of drug through particle engineering and design of more efficient devices [8]. In vitro characterization of throat deposition becomes more critical for the high-dose antibiotics than the traditional asthma and COPD medications. Throat deposition of aerosols may be more accurately measured with the Alberta throat than the traditional USP induction port [108].

Rapid inhalation of highly concentrated solution or dry powder may cause irritation by changing the osmotic environment in airways. A preliminary clinical study in 21 healthy subjects has shown that lower outputs and flow rates of the Orbital inhaler may reduce the events of cough when the subjects inhaled dry powder of mannitol [110]. Table 2\nsummarizes the data obtained from a number of clinical studies. The incidence of cough events varied largely in different clinical trials due to the chemical nature of the drug, different subject conditions (healthy or with CF), drug doses and evaluation methods. Amongst all factors, the chemical nature of the drug appears to be most influential. For example, CF patients experienced lower incidences of cough (25.4% vs 20.3% for control, n = 117) after the inhalation of 400 mg of mannitol powder [111], as compared to a significantly higher incidence of cough (75.4% of CF patients, n = 186) after inhalation of colistin methanesulfonate dry powder [83]. In addition, two studies examined different inhalers, Osmohaler\u2122 for mannitol and Turbospin\u00ae for CMS, and demonstrated that the effect of inhaler design cannot be diminished. Therefore, there remains a paucity of information comparing the common adverse effects of cough and oropharyngeal irritation after inhalation of antibiotics, and future studies are warranted.",

This is particular true if doses of the drug are high or excipients that deposit in the lung are used in large quantities. As the doses for antibiotics that need to be delivered to the lung by inhalation are usually large, much higher doses than the inhaled asthma and COPD drugs are required and can cause problems on tolerability and safety. For example, large amounts of drug powder can be irritating and repeated irritation may lead to inflammation. In addition, instantaneously increased osmolarity of fluids in the respiratory tract after inhalation can cause irritation leading to cough, bronchoconstriction and ultimately inflammatory reaction.

Usually, the highest tolerable dose is proposed in clinical trials in order to achieve clinical efficacy and accelerate the approval; however, adverse effects can occur even for the approved inhaled antibiotics due to the inhalation of high-dose antibiotics. Hence, dosing strategies should be optimized using antimicrobial PK/PD for superior clinical outcomes and minimal adverse effects [112]. With no doubt, PK/PD studies of inhaled antibiotics are very challenging in human subjects, because plasma PK may not be correlated with the clinical efficacy of inhaled treatment for respiratory infections. Bronchoalveolar lavage is highly invasive in patients and sputum antibiotic concentration is usually a poor surrogate of drug exposure in the lung. Preclinical PK/PD evaluation in animals is more practical [113] and has been widely employed for oral and parenteral administration of antibiotics [114]. However, there is very limited PK/PD information on inhaled antibiotics using animal models. The choice of animal models for PK/PD studies after antibiotic inhalation is usually based upon practical considerations; rodents, rabbits and guinea pigs are most commonly used [115], [116], [117]. For larger animal species, factors including welfare and large inhalation chambers should be considered [118]. In addition to safety issues, overuse of inhalation of high-dose antibiotics can also promote resistance. In summary, to minimize the risk in moving a new product into expensive clinical trials, reliable animal models are required for determination of the most predictive PK/PD parameters of inhaled antibiotics.",

Ribavirin is a prodrug that is metabolized to its active 5\u2032-monophosphate form that resembles the purine guanosine nucleotide. Due to the structural similarity to guanosine, ribavirin interferes with viral replication by incorporating into viral transcripts leading to \u2018error-prone\u2019 replication in RNA viruses [124], [125], [126], [127]. Ribavirin also interferes with guanosine synthesis and viral mRNA capping [124], [125], [126], [127].",

Because of the expense of ribavirin delivery by aerosol for 12 to 18 h daily and the inconvenience, aerosolized ribavirin therapy is largely restricted to high-risk patients including premature births, organ transplant recipients, chronic lung disease, congenital heart disease, and immunodeficiency disease [2], [119], [120], [121], [122], [131], [132], [133], [134], [136], [137], [138], [139], [140], [141]. Inhaled ribavirin therapy has also been successfully used for the treatment of parainfluenza 3 virus respiratory tract infection in infants with severe immunodeficiency [142]. Notably, inhaled ribavirin in combination with intravenous immunoglobulin E showed good efficacy for the treatment of adult blood and marrow transplant recipients [143], [144], [145], [146], [147], [148]. Aerosolized ribavirin is well tolerated in both infants and adults, and the adverse effects are minimal as it is too poorly absorbed systemically to cause the hemolytic anemia that is observed after oral administration. Pediatric patients receiving ribavirin administered by face mask for 2.5 h/day for 3 days had plasma concentrations ranging from 0.44 to 1.55 \u03bcM (mean concentration of 0.76 \u03bcM) with a plasma half-life of 9.5 h [149]. Infrequent bronchospasm and sudden deterioration of respiratory function has been reported in infants receiving aerosolized ribavirin; accordingly respiratory function must be closely monitored and therapy should be terminated immediately at the first signs of respiratory distress [133], [150]. In view that ribavirin is embryotoxic and teratogenic in several animal species, precautions should be taken to avoid drug exposure of pregnant healthcare workers tending patients receiving aerosolized ribavirin therapy [120], [151].",

In controlled human clinical trials, the administration of aerosolized ribavirin therapy within 24 h of the onset of illness produced a significant reduction in the severity of illness compared to the placebo groups [162], [163], [164], [165], [166], [167], [168], [169], [170]. Irrespective of these preliminary results, ribavirin has not been approved for the treatment of influenza infections in patients. The major safety concerns for its application for influenza therapy include hemolytic anemia (Table 1) and teratogenicity, which are more commonly associated with the intravenous administration of ribavirin [149], [171]. Clearly, further clinical trials are warranted to assess the safety and efficacy of aerosolized ribavirin for influenza therapy. Ribavirin has also been trialed as treatment for Hantavirus infections that cause hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome in humans; mixed findings were reported and further clinical evaluation is needed [172], [173], [174].",

It blocks the release of progeny virus particles from the infected cells, thereby halting the replication cycle [175], [176]. The high degree of homology among the neuraminidase active sites of most influenza A and B strains endows these compounds with a broad spectrum of activity against currently circulating influenza strains [177], [178]. Mutations in the neuraminidase gene and/or the hemagglutinin gene of influenza viruses are associated with resistance to neuraminidase inhibitors. A World Health Organization (WHO) collaborating center surveillance study detected zanamivir resistance in only 2.3% of seasonal influenza H1N1 isolates [179]. The neuraminidase His275Y mutation is one of the most common resistance phenotypes observed across influenza A viruses of the N1 subtype [180]. This mutation is associated with a high level of viral resistance to oseltamivir, whereas zanamivir and laninamivir octanoate (see Section 3.3) remain active. Viral resistance to zanamivir has been found to correlate with a Gln136Lys mutation in the neuraminidase [179].",

Zanamivir is delivered as dry powder by a Diskhaler inhalation device, with one blister for each inhalation. Treatment should begin within 48 h after onset of symptoms. The recommended dose for treatment of influenza infection in children from the age of 5 years and adults is two inhalations (2 \u00d7 5 mg) twice daily for five days (total daily inhaled dose 20 mg). The recommended dose for post-exposure prophylaxis, within 36 h of exposure to an infected individual, is two inhalations (2 \u00d7 5 mg) once daily for 10 days. The recommended dose for seasonal prophylaxis during a community outbreak is two inhalations (2 \u00d7 5 mg) once daily for up to 28 days [178]. After inhalation, approximately 15% of the dry powder is deposited in the lower respiratory tract, with the remainder in the oropharynx where it remains for up to 24 h [182]. Treatment should be initiated as soon as possible following symptom onset, ideally within 48 h [178], [183]. Clinical trials have shown that adherence to these treatment windows significantly reduces the duration of illness, symptom severity and the rate of influenza associated complications [181], [183], [184], [185], [186]. In a comparative study, it was shown that treatment with inhaled zanamivir was more effective than oral oseltamivir in reducing symptom severity in patients infected with either influenza A or B viruses [187]. Randomized, placebo-controlled studies have also convincingly demonstrated that zanamivir is efficacious when used for the prophylaxis; however, it is not yet approved for this indication. The combined use of oral oseltamivir with inhaled zanamivir antiviral treatment has not been proven useful for the prevention of influenza-related complications in ventilator and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO)-treated critically ill patients infected with pandemic influenza A (H1N1) [188].",

In fact, the death caused by off-label use of Relenza (i.e. the powder formulation was reconstituted in liquid for nebulization) was due to blockage of the expiratory filter, presumably by lactose in the formulation [190]. This incident might have been avoided if Relenza was used via the Diskhaler DPI, which is feasible for intubated patients using an Ambu-bag delivery system [192]. Nevertheless, the use of zanamivir is prohibited in patients with compromised respiratory function [190], [191].",

            "text": "Laninamivir (Fig. 2) is a long-acting version of Zanamivir. Laninamivir octanoate (Inavirl\u00ae, Daiichi Sankyo, Japan) is an inhaled neuraminidase inhibitor that is only approved in Japan for the treatment and prophylaxis of influenza A and B virus infections in both adults and children [193], [194], [195], [196]. Laninamivir octanoate is an octanoyl ester prodrug that is transformed via conversion to the active form laninamivir by intracellular esterases following uptake into the epithelial cells lining the airway. The active laninamivir is retained in the airway at concentrations higher than the IC50 against most influenza neuraminidases for over 10 days following a single inhalation dose of 20 or 40 mg. Although the efficiency and safety of laninamivir octanoate is comparable to zanamivir, the once-daily dose of 40 mg (adults) or 20 mg (children under 10 years of age) dry powder inhalation makes laninamivir octanoate therapy more convenient [197]. The prolonged and high exposure of laninamivir in respiratory tissue is believed to be due to its limited efflux from epithelial cells. Laninamivir displays comparable activity to oseltamivir against currently circulating influenza A and B viruses, including H1N1 viruses carrying the His275Tyr neuraminidase mutation [194], [195]. Inhaled laninamivir octanoate is well tolerated; notably comparable rates of nausea and vomiting were observed in patients treated with laninamivir octanoate (Table 1) with those treated with oseltamivir [194], [195]. Recently a Phase-II clinical trial (referred to as IGLOO) was conducted by Biota Pharmaceuticals comparing the safety and efficacy of a 40 mg and 80 mg dose of laninamivir octanoate (\u201cLANI\u201d) delivered by the TwinCaps\u00ae inhaler. Disappointingly, it did not alleviate patient-reported influenza symptoms compared to placebo, although a statistically significant reduction in viral shedding was shown for the patients at both doses on Day 3 [198].",

            "text": "Intranasal interferon is very effective in preventing rhinovirus colds via post-exposure prophylaxis of family contacts; however, it has not proven to be effective for the treatment of established infections [199], [200], [201], [202], [203], [204], [205], [206]. Intranasal IFN-\u03b12 at a dose of 1 \u00d7 106 international units (IU) twice daily for 4 weeks provided approximately 75\u201387% protection against rhinovirus respiratory infections (responsible for ~ 50% of common colds) [199], [200], [201], [208], [209], [210]. The degree of protection is dependent upon the interferon dose and duration of use prior to virus exposure [210]. High doses of ~ 22\u201344 \u00d7 106\n IU per day prevented infection [204], [210], [211], [212], [213], [214], [215], [216], [217], [218], whereas infection was observed with lower doses of ~ 1 \u00d7 106\n IU per day [204], [210], [211], [212], [213], [214]. Notably, prophylactic low doses of IFN-\u03b12 of approximately 2 \u00d7 106\n IU per day have been shown to be effective in preventing infection when begun 1 week prior to virus exposure [204], [210], [211], [212], [213], [214]. Protection has also been demonstrated against infections caused by coronavirus, the second most common etiology of colds and partial protection has been demonstrated against experimental influenza A virus infection [203], [219]. The utility for the treatment of respiratory infections in high-risk patients has yet to be comprehensively investigated.",

The severity of these symptoms is dependent upon both the dose and duration of treatment [220], [221], [222]. Approximately 10\u201315% of volunteers receiving 3\u20135 \u00d7 106\n IU per intranasal interferon daily reported experiencing these symptoms [220], [221], [222]. Systemic toxicity such as transient leukopenia has been noted with very large doses (> 10 \u00d7 106\n IU/day) of interferon nasal spray after 3 week use [212], [213], [222], [224].",

RFI-641 showed good efficacy following intranasal administration in mouse and African green monkey models of RSV infection at doses as low as 0.04 mg/kg [230], [231], [232]. VP-14637 (Fig. 2; syn. MDT-637) is an experimental RSV fusion inhibitor that was licensed by ViroPharma to MicroDose Therapeutx who develops a dry powder formulation for inhaled delivery [233], [234]. It was reported that Johnson & Johnson developed an inhaled RSV fusion inhibitor, JNJ 2408068 [235]. The compound showed good anti-RSV efficacy and safety in a rat RSV infection model (efficacious dose 10 \u00d7 0.39 mg/kg for 4 days) [235]. TMC353121 (Fig. 2) is another small molecule RSV fusion inhibitor that was developed by Johnson & Johnson. Intravenous administration of TMC353121 (0.25\u201310 mg/kg) in rats displayed prophylactic protection and effective treatment against RSV challenge (within a 48-hour time window) [236], [237]. Bristol-Myers Squibb developed BMS-433771, an advanced lead RSV fusion inhibitor which showed good oral availability, low cytotoxicity (EC50\n \u2265 218 \u03bcM) and high anti-RSV activity (EC50\n = 12 nM) [238], [239].",

Poly ICLC elicits an antiviral immune response via activation of the Toll-like receptor-3 which induces the production of IFN-\u03b1, -\u03b2 and -\u03b3 [240], [241], [242], that in turn leads to the stimulation of both the innate and adaptive immune responses, including the activation of natural killer cells.

The development of an inhaled anti-viral treatment is certainly a viable development strategy considering the transmission of smallpox virus occurs through inhalation of airborne virus. The development of an inhaled cidofovir therapeutic will also provide prophylaxis of individuals in which the currently approved smallpox vaccination is contraindicated, such as those suffering from severe exfoliative skin diseases, the immunocompromised, and pregnancy. The successful completion of this exciting program will yield a practical and cost-effective treatment solution for this deadly Category A bioterrorism agent.",

Inhalation of antivirals provides significant pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics benefit that is essential for maximizing efficacy while minimizing any potential systemic toxicity and emergence of resistance. Currently there are only a handful of approved inhaled antiviral drugs. The increasing incidence of resistance and the emergence of new respiratory viruses are concerning. The use of inhaled antiviral agents with different modes of action in combination may be one of the best means whereby the emergence of resistance can be avoided. Another barrier for the optimal use of inhaled antivirals is the delay in viral diagnosis. As new and improved inhaled antiviral agents are approved, rapid viral diagnosis will play a major role in their optimal use for chemoprophylaxis and treatment of respiratory viral infections.",

Inhaled pentamidine (Fig. 3; NebuPent\u00ae) is an antifungal approved for prophylaxis of PCP caused by Pneumocystis jirovecii (formerly known as P. carinii) [244]. A number of studies have shown inhaled pentamidine therapy is effective for this indication, albeit its application is reserved for patients who cannot tolerate the first-line therapies such as trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and dapsone [245], [246], [247], [248], [249], [250]. The recommended dose of aerosolized pentamidine (isethionate) for adults is 300 mg every 4 weeks using a Respirgard II\u00ae nebulizer for delivery over 30\u201345 min [18]. Side-effects (Table 1) include cough, throat irritation, bronchospasm, fatigue and dizziness [247], [249], [250], [251], [252]. A major concern with pentamidine inhalation therapy is that secondary infections may arise due to herpes zoster, oral Candida and influenza [244].",

Amphotericin B is available in two different forms, deoxycholate or liposomal form. The type of delivery device together with variable particle size of each aerosolized amphotericin B formulation has been shown to impact upon the half-life and pulmonary distribution [254], [255], [256], [257], [258]. After a single dose, nebulized liposomal amphotericin B displays a prolonged antifungal activity with longer half-lives in rodents and patients, compared to the deoxycholate formulation [257], [258], [259]. In terms of prophylaxis efficacy, a clinical trial of aerosolized liposomal amphotericin B in lung transplant recipients showed that administration every 2 weeks may be sufficient to prevent aspergillosis infection, without adverse effects [260]. Although several studies in patients with lung transplants and hematological malignancies reported promising results, due to the mixed findings and small patient numbers involved, the use of inhaled amphotericin B for the prophylaxis of Aspergillus infections is currently not recommended [261], [262], [263], [264], [265], [266]. Inhaled amphotericin B in combination with IFN-\u03b3 has also been successfully trialed for the treatment of post-influenza pseudomembranous necrotising bronchial aspergillosis infection [267]. A number of studies have evaluated the intrapulmonary pharmacokinetics of various formulations of amphotericin B using different nebulizers [254], [258], [268], [269]. The nebulization of amphotericin B deoxycholate using the Respirgard II\u00ae and PariBoy\u00ae devices generates particles that can deposit in both the upper and lower respiratory tract [254], [258], [268], [269], [270]. Side-effects associated with aerosolized amphotericin B include cough, tongue numbness, taste disturbances, chest tightness, nausea and vomiting (Table 1) [253], [270], [271], [272].",

Aerosolizing this intravenous formulation has been demonstrated to be effective for the targeted airway delivery of pulmonary aspergillosis caused by A. fumigates in animal infection models and patients [273], [274]. Notably, inhaled voriconazole substantially concentrated in the lung and showed good safety in a rodent infection model [275], [276]. Taken together, these encouraging preliminary findings advocate the need for clinical studies with this effective antifungal agent. L-693989 (Fig. 3; Merck) is a water soluble lipopeptide that has been shown to be a very effective antipneumocystis agent in a rat model for P. jirovecii pneumonia [277]. In the infected rats aerosolized l-693989 administered at a daily dose of 0.7 \u03bcg/lung was effective in preventing the development of cysts and pneumonia [277]. Ideally L-693989 can be developed as an aerosol prophylactic for P. jirovecii pneumonia. Aerosolized nanostructured intraconazole is effective for prophylaxis against invasive pulmonary aspergillosis in mouse infection models [278], [279]. Aerosolized caspofungin has also been shown to decrease the mortality of pulmonary aspergillosis in rats when administered prophylactically [280].",

In vivo studies are urgently required to elucidate the role of inhaled antifungal agents for the treatment of pulmonary fungal infection over a wider variety of disease states. The available inhaled antifungals are simply aerosolized forms of the intravenous formulations of these drugs. Antifungal drugs specifically designed and formulated (including dry powder inhalation products) are severely lacking. Although a few promising antifungal compounds that are specifically formulated for aerosolization are in the pipeline, the pharmaceutical sector needs to invest more heavily in this neglected area.",

This review underscores the importance of the inhaled delivery of anti-infectives to combat human respiratory infections that are responsible for millions of deaths each year, notwithstanding the associated economic burdens [1], [2], [3]. The main advantage of the inhalation use of anti-infectives is that it affords high drug exposure at the primary site of infection, while minimizing the risks of potential systemic toxicity or avoiding unfavorable PK/PD associated with systemic use. The therapeutic value of an inhaled anti-infective agent is dependent upon the severity and frequency of infection, and the safety and PK/PD of the anti-infective agent, particularly in critically-ill patients who are at the highest risk of complications. All new products to be administered by the inhalation route must be safe with acceptable tolerability [281]. As detailed herein, there are a number of promising inhaled anti-infective drug candidates currently in the developmental pipeline, and if found to be safe, they will represent valuable therapeutic options for clinicians to improve the outcomes and survival rates of patients with difficult-to-treat respiratory infections.",
