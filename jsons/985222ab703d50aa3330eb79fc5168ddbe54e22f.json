On admission to PICU, she was drowsy, tachycardic, tachypneic, with rashes, and hepatosplenomegaly. Lab findings showed thrombocytopenia, leucopenia, low ESR, normal CRP, elevated liver enzymes, high ferritin, LDH, and triglycerides suggestive of macrophage activation syndrome (MAS). Chest X-ray showed left basal pneumonia and DNA PCR of throat swab revealed adenovirus. She was diagnosed as adenovirus-triggered MAS and was initiated on pulse methylprednisolone (6 mg/kg). Because of suboptimal response after 2 doses, manifested by increasing drowsiness, further fall in platelets and rising ferritin, methylprednisolone dosage was increased to 30 mg/kg/day with the addition of oral cyclosporine (4 mg/kg/day). In view of worsening of the chest X-ray and increasing oxygen requirement, Cidofovir infusion (1 mg/kg thrice weekly) was also started simultaneously considering increased activity of the adenoviral infection concurrent to immunosuppression. Within 48 h, the child showed signs of recovery with improved consciousness, lower oxygen requirements, and improving lab parameters. She was discharged after 3 weeks of IV Cidofovir, on oral prednisolone and cyclosporine. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported use of Cidofovir in adenovirus-induced MAS.",

However, even after adequate fluid boluses and 2 doses of methylprednisolone, she remained acidotic (metabolic), drowsy with increasing work of breathing and increasing oxygen requirements. Repeat investigations after 24 h showed falling platelets 76,000/mm3, falling hemoglobin 7.9 g%, and rising ferritin 61,134 ng/mL with worsening chest X-ray ( Fig. 1 ). Hence, a decision was taken to initiate Cidofovir with intensified immunosuppression (IV methylprednisolone pulse 30 mg/kg plus oral cyclosporine 4 mg/kg/day). Cidofovir was started at 1 mg/kg on alternate day, considering its nephrotoxic potential and concurrent use of cyclosporine. Within 48 h of the intensified treatment, the child was afebrile, with improved consciousness and decreasing oxygen requirement. Labs also improved, total count increased to 7200/mm3 with decreased transaminases, and ferritin drastically came down to 9034 ng/mL, but platelet was 57,000/mm3. After 3 pulses of 30 mg/kg, IV methylprednisolone was reduced to 6 mg/kg/ dose for 2 days and on day 7 switched over to oral prednisolone (2 mg/kg/day). Her chest X-ray showed resolution of the pneumonia by day 7 (Fig. 2) . However, considering the concurrent immunosuppression and the slow progressive potential of adenovirus, she was administered Cidofovir for 3 weeks with regular monitoring of renal functions. At discharge, she had hemoglobin 11.2 g%, TLC 9000/mm3, platelet 2.5lac/mm3, and ferritin 2069 ng/mL. She remains well 6 months after follow-up.",

Though mostly self-limiting, they can be fatal in the immunocompromised and occasionally in healthy individuals.

Multiplex PCR assays for detecting multiple Clin Rheumatol respiratory pathogens using nasopharyngeal secretions provide rapid diagnosis especially in hospitalized children for suspected pneumonia. Since detection of specific viruses by this method may represent colonization or shedding rather than infection, results need to be interpreted in the context of the clinical setting. Considering the clinical presentation of a febrile lower respiratory tract infection with worsening X-rays and adenovirus on nasopharyngeal swab, the child was diagnosed as adenoviral pneumonia.",

Significant features of MAS included fever (96%, often persistent rather than quotidian patterns), hepatomegaly (70%), splenomegaly (58%), and lymphadenopathy (51%). Central nervous system dysfunction ranging from seizures, lethargy, irritability, confusion, headache, and coma occurred in 35%. Twenty-six percent of patients had cardiac involvement with pericardial involvement being the most common. Pulmonary involvement with pleural effusions occurred in 22% of patients. Bleeding manifestations ranged from petechiae, purpura, mucosal, or gastrointestinal bleeding in 20% and disseminated intravascular coagulation in 1%. Renal involvement ranging from renal failure, hematuria, and proteinuria was seen in 15%. It is prudent to note that MAS was present in almost 40% of patients who did not demonstrate tissue hemophagocytosis. Laboratory features of MAS include a drop in ESR, WBC, platelet counts, and fibrinogen levels with extremely elevated ferritin levels, elevated CRP and liver enzymes, lactate dehydrogenase, triglycerides, D-dimer, and prolonged prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time. Soluble IL-2 receptor and soluble CD163 are also elevated in active MAS [7] . The low CRP of the patient at admission in the setting of a MAS was attributed to the recent Tocilizumab administration [8] , rise in CRP being IL6 mediated.",

Though rigorously used clinically in AIDS patients for CMV retinitis treatment, it was subsequently found to be more active than other antivirals for treating adenoviral infections and has been used for treatment of invasive adenoviral infections in immunecompromised patients. However, published data on the efficacy of CDV for adenovirus infection are limited to case reports and small nonrandomized series [9, 10] . In hematopoietic stem cell and lung transplant recipients, early administration of CDV has been associated with decreased viral load, clinical improvement, and increased survival [10] [11] [12] [13] .

The optimum duration of Cidofovir therapy is not standardized but has to be individualized depending on therapeutic response. Since our patient was on long-term immunosuppressives and was planned discharge on oral Prednisolone and cyclosporine, we decided to administer Cidofovir for a total of 3 weeks duration.",

Adenovirus is also emerging as an important respiratory pathogen that can lead to serious morbidity in immune competent and mortality in the immunocompromised. Early identification of the pathogen and timely initiation of Cidofovir in select individuals have been shown to improve consequences, though currently use of the drug is limited to hemato-oncologists in transplant patients. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported usage of Cidofovir as an antiviral in MAS induced by an adenoviral infection.",
