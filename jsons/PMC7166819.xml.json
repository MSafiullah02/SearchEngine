It now appears that much early misplaced optimism can be attributed to the fruits of the pre\u2010molecular era (1955\u20101990) and should have been tempered by a realization that, for reasons still largely unknown, immune responses to animal lentivirus infections very rarely result in long\u2010term reductions in viral load and accompanying pathogenesis.9 The same is true of several members of the genera Hepacivirus and Pestivirus of the family Flaviviridae, as represented by HCV and several veterinary viruses that produce chronic infections. The absence of much\u2010needed vaccines against herpes simplex virus types \u20101 and \u20102 (HSV\u20101, \u20102), respiratory syncytial viruses (RSV), most other respiratory and arthropod\u2010borne viruses (except Japanese encephalitis and, until very recently, dengue viruses) and genetically stable live\u2010attenuated oral poliovirus vaccines (OPVs) is attributable to the properties of individual viruses and to the deficiencies of currently used animal models of human pathogenesis, notably mice.10 It is also partly due to a continuing and inevitable disconnect with veterinary virology where the relevance of animal models is rarely an issue. These factors, together with the difficulties and prohibitive costs of conducting Phase III clinical trials on vaccines against newly emergent pathogens,11 have made modern human vaccine development and manufacture in many countries a marginally profitable enterprise that can only be sustained with major inputs from government. Regulatory concerns expressed, sometimes years after the initial registration, are especially a problem and specific examples are given below. The predictable consequences, at least in Western countries, are a declining skill base in older technologies, such as the development and the large\u2010scale application of diploid and continuous cell lines for use in the preparation of vaccine viruses and antigens, and a concomitant increase in risk aversion.",

Associated developments in the late 1970s early 1980s were the accreditation of human diploid fibroblast cell lines and continuous epithelial lines (most notably the Vero and MDCK lines) as substrates for the growth of vaccine viruses. Accreditation of both types of cell culture signified a major shift in thinking by regulators as to their oncogenic potential.12 Until then, continuous cell lines had been used for the preparation of veterinary viral vaccines and shown to be safe and efficacious for animals but disallowed for use in the preparation of human vaccines. Without these changes, it is doubtful whether many highly successful vaccines against poliovirus, measles, mumps, and rubella would still be available today. This is especially true for OPVs prepared from primary monkey kidney epithelial (MK) cultures until the early 1980s. MK cultures allow high poliovirus yields but had long been recognized as problematic for use in vaccine manufacture for reasons of cost, the diminishing availability of primates and the ubiquitous presence in cultures of contaminating simian viruses. Targeted vaccination programs have largely eliminated poliomyelitis, a commonplace childhood disease in developed countries until the late 50s. Despite some unforeseen difficulties with their expanded use in developing countries and molecular evidence of genetic instability following human passage, OPVs continue to have a critical role in the prevention of poliomyelitis.13\n",

Their development during the 1950 60 seconds took place in the almost complete absence of molecular data as to the genetic stability of individual vaccine viruses. The subsequent application of contemporary molecular technologies has shown that, for OPVs, genetic instability associated with neurovirulence occurs following human passage.14 The neurovirulence risk can be overcome by the replacement of OPVs with IPVs in vaccination programs. However, IPVs require higher antigen doses and the costs of manufacture are higher because of the need for increased safety testing. The introduction of IPVs throughout the developing world is likely to be gradual and, because type II nonvaccine viruses have not been detected in susceptible populations for several years, recent OPVs have been modified to exclude Type II vaccine viruses as an additional safety measure.",

If SSPE had then been widely recognized at the time, the developers of live measles vaccines could have faced potentially insurmountable hurdles to prove that mass administration would not be associated with increases in the incidence of SSPE. Given that satisfactory in vitro markers for SSPE still do not exist, such a requirement would have placed a near\u2010impossible burden upon manufacturers, despite extensive evidence of safety in clinical trials. These vaccines have been responsible for the virtual elimination of measles in developed countries and have made enormous inroads into its control in developing countries.15 Unlike inactivated polio vaccines, inactivated vaccines designed to protect against measles, mumps and rubella viruses are ineffective and, alarmingly in the case of measles, vaccination followed by the natural challenge is associated with immunopathologic disease.16\n",

They include replacement with strains that are more immunogenic and/or are associated with fewer adverse reactions. Over 40 years licensed US measles vaccines have been prepared from the original Edmonston to the currently used Moraten (previously known as the Edmonston\u2010Enders) strain.27 These changes, unfortunately, have not extended to the replacement of OPVs. Such issues that figure high in today's highly regulated vaccine market have in the recent past been a severe economic disincentive to any of the few remaining poliovirus vaccine manufacturers in developed countries even mildly interested in OPV strain replacement. However, the situation may change with the development of codon\u2010pair bias de\u2010optimization methodologies that allow the possible use of redundant underrepresented codon pairs without introducing changes to the amino acid sequences of virion proteins of OPVs or other live vaccine viruses.28 The key question is whether the introduced mutations result in changes to viral immunogenicity, which can only be determined from large, expensive clinical trials. Great improvements in disease control have resulted from improved vaccination regimes and the use of trivalent measles\u2010mumps\u2010rubella (MMR) and quadrivalent measles\u2010mumps\u2010rubella\u2010varicella (MMRV) vaccines. However, it should be noted that high levels of maternal antibodies arising from natural infection compromise the efficiency of vaccination in infants. In developed countries, the universal use of MMR/MMRV vaccines for infants was only possible after the virtual elimination of endemic measles by vaccination. Before that, vaccination was undertaken at 15 to 18 months when levels of the maternal antibody had declined, and several months after the administration of the first dose of other pediatric viral vaccines. Conversely, in the developing world protection afforded by measles vaccines is lower in populations where the levels of maternal antibody are high.29\n",

The Oka strain was further attenuated by Merck, and the renamed Oka\u2010Merck strain has been used in the United States and other countries to prepare varicella vaccine (Varivax) after further adaptation to growth in cells of the WI\u201038 and MRC\u20105 human diploid lines. A 10\u2010year review revealed that the vaccine is generally safe and well\u2010tolerated.40 Pediatric vaccines are administered in two doses, commencing at 18 months, with a further booster at the commencement of high school (12\u201013 years). For adolescents and adults who have not experienced childhood varicella infections, administration of two doses at an interval of 2 months is widely recommended. Recrudescent infections of childhood varicella infections (herpes zoster), constitute a significant disease burden for the elderly and, because of early priming experiences and the declining capacity of the elderly to mount protective immune responses, doses that are 14\u2010fold higher than those used for the prevention of varicella in children are required.41 The adult vaccine, now licensed as Zostavax is well tolerated and provides immunity against infection by herpes zoster virus and amelioration of the symptoms of postherpetic neuralgia.42\n",

Lability can be overcome by sonic disruption of infected cells, followed by lyophilization and cold\u2010storage. However, the reconstituted vaccine must be used within a relatively short time, which restricts its use in tropical countries. By comparison, polioviruses used in either OPVs or IPVs are highly stable, do not require lyophilization and can be stored at 4 to 6\u00b0C for long periods. They also produce yields of infectious virus in cell culture ~100\u00d7 higher than VZV. Because of these constraints, much effort has been expended in recent years by GlaxoSmithKline to develop an adjuvanted, inactivated herpes zoster vaccine (Shingrix) with expressed surface glycoprotein E as the protective antigen. Early large clinical trials to determine protection have been encouraging.44 While the potential advantages of such an approach are clear, earlier studies with the live Oka\u2010Merck vaccine have indicated that cell\u2010mediated immunity (CMI) is the prime determinant of protection against VZV45 and the results of large clinical trials to determine CMI or other surrogate immunologic responses to the Shingrix vaccine are eagerly awaited.",

            "text": "Recently imposed regulatory issues arising from greater insights into viral replication and pathogenesis have impacted significantly on viral vaccine manufacture in the developed world. Particular issues of concern are:\nDeficiencies in many animal models used for assessment of protection against human viral infections. In their absence, new vaccines, especially those designed for use in infants, face formidable regulatory obstacles.Use of inappropriate viruses to obtain predictive data in animal models (eg, mouse\u2010adapted influenza and respiratory syncytial viruses; other viruses of uncertain passage history).Lack of recognition that, despite legitimate concerns as to the possibility of reversion to virulence, immunity to most human viral diseases is best achieved by live attenuated viruses (eg, herpes and enteric viruses; RSV and respiratory viruses, including influenza; other viruses whose pathogenesis is complex and dependent on amplification in more than one target organ, such as measles and yellow fever viruses.The possibility that some live herpesvirus vaccine viruses will undergo latency during replication, followed by recrudescence and subsequent infection by pathogenic viral progeny (eg, HSV\u20101 and \u20102). However, for live veterinary herpesvirus vaccines, reported problems from recrudescence have been few, the best example being the herpesvirus of turkeys (HVT) that has been used for over 40 years for control of Marek's disease virus (MDV), an oncogenic avian herpesvirus and a cause of great economic loss in intensively raised chickens.47 Until the mid\u20101990s, HVT was the first and only example of an effective vaccine in either animals or humans that could be used for the prevention of neoplastic viral disease. The genome of HVT has 70% to 80% nucleotide homology with pathogenic MDVs but is completely innocuous for chickens. The effectiveness of live human VSV and MDV and other veterinary vaccines suggests that it may be worth revisiting the development of live vaccines using more readily cultivable human herpesviruses.The inability of many human viruses to either grow in cell cultures (eg, HBV, human noroviruses) or produce yields of infectious progeny sufficiently high for use in vaccines (HIV, HCV; other herpesviruses). However, a recent report describes the propagation of human noroviruses in stem cells derived from human intestinal enteroid cultures,48 which may have great significance for the development of effective vaccines.Poor antigenic responses to glycosylated surface antigens expressed in Escherichia coli, Salmonellae, or yeasts, all of which were first proposed in the early 1980s as alternatives to embryonated eggs in inactivated influenza vaccine manufacture.49\nPoor immunogenicity of peptide epitope vaccines based on defined regions associated with protection. Although their use in vaccines is attractive from the standpoint of standardization, peptides suffer from two major disadvantages. First, the B\u2010cell antigenic sites of many proteins are conformational epitopes, consisting of discontinuous sequences of amino acids, and such conformations are difficult to recapitulate synthetically. Second, the immune responses of inbred mice, used in most studies, are genetically restricted according to the haplotype of the mouse.50 The MHC diversity between individual mouse strains is limited and therefore immune responses in inbred mice are likely to be even more restricted than in an outbred human population. The greater MHC diversity in a human outbred population would probably result in a high proportion of nonresponders to individual peptides and necessitate the need for a large number of epitopes to the major histocompatibility complex. Furthermore, responses to peptides from influenza A virus matrix protein 2 (MP2), that has been proposed as a universal protective antigen or to peptides from the protective hemagglutinin antigen, have been shown to be very weak unless coupled to carriers, such as multiple antigenic peptide constructs (MAPs) or KLH, whose likely approval for large\u2010scale human use is open to question.DNA vaccines prepared from genomic DNA or cDNA from RNA viruses and administered by the IM or SC routes, widely touted in the 1990s as measures for the ultimate control of viral diseases, especially influenza, hepatitis B and HIV. Unfortunately, the results from many early clinical trials were disappointing, with most DNA vaccines being shown to be poorly immunogenic, even when used with an adjuvant.51 However, more recent reports on the protection afforded by Zika DNA vaccines in primates are encouraging.52 For influenza cDNA vaccines, further regulatory issues arise concerning immunologic recall after earlier priming with heterotypic hemagglutinin antigens (the phenomenon of original antigenic sin\n53, 54). However, up to and including 2019 no DNA vaccines have been licensed.\n",

Early clinical trials with H5N1 avian influenza vaccines have not been encouraging. Two adjuvanted doses of vaccine are required to induce HI antibody titers of 1:32 to 1:40 which are considered necessary for the protection against seasonal influenza viruses.56 However, the protective antibody level required for vaccines most avian subtypes is unknown. Because of these limitations, much effort has been directed in recent years towards the development of so\u2010called universal vaccines, the ultimate goal being the induction of long\u2010term protection against both pandemic and nonpandemic influenza A viruses. Approaches to their development have included the use of:\nExpressed nonglycosylated M2 surface antigen or an M2e peptide fused with a bacterial protein. Some protection was demonstrated in mice where the response appears to be nonneutralizing and directed at target cells; early human trials were largely unsatisfactory.57 However, better results have been achieved with HA2\u2010based conformational mutants expressed in E. coli.58\nThe variable stalk region of the HA and the identification of broadly neutralizing antibodies from different regions of the stalk, using so\u2010called headless proteins as antigens.59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66 Other groups have attempted to design vaccines containing small conserved regions of the stalk. However, it is not known why antibodies are not normally made to the stalk as a consequence of infections by influenza A viruses. Good cross\u2010protection across H3N2 sub\u2010types was shown from earlier studies in mice but cross\u2010protection against H1N1 viruses was less impressive.Chimeric viruses prepared from high\u2010yielding vectors with internal group\u2010specific antigens. Vectors include vesicular stomatitis virus, adenoviruses, or poxviruses.67, 68, 69 At issue is whether the long\u2010term administration of common vector antigens inhibits specific responses to the inserted surface antigens of new pandemic viruses.Pseudotypes that do not produce infectious progeny, but induce satisfactory short\u2010term protective responses in mice after i.n. administration, including antibody to both HA and NA surface antigens, CTL and resistance to challenge.70, 71 Importantly, they have been shown to be effective in heterotypic challenge experiments in ferrets whose pathogenesis is similar to that of humans.72 Such an approach could provide short\u2010term protection in the initial stages of a pandemic.\n",
