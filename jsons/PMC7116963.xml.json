            "text": "Borna disease virus (BDV), a member of the family Bornaviridae in the order Mononegavirales, is an enveloped virus with a non-segmented, negative-strand (NNS) ribonucleic acid (RNA) genome (Ludwig et al., 1988, de la Torre, 1994, Schneemann et al., 1995). BDV infects a wide variety of mammal species (Ludwig and Bode, 2000, Hornig et al., 2003). Infected animal hosts develop a large spectrum of neuropsychiatric pathologies ranging from immune-mediated neurological disease to non-inflammatory behavioral alterations (Ludwig and Bode, 2000), which are notably reminiscent of symptoms observed in certain human neuropsychiatric disorders (Hornig et al., 2001). Therefore, several studies have attempted to conclusively associate BDV with human psychiatric illness, but the findings remain controversial (Bode et al., 1995, Iwata et al., 1998, Kim et al., 1999, Fukuda et al., 2001, Ikuta et al., 2002, Bode and Ludwig, 2003, Hornig et al., 2012). Regardless of this debate, a few human BDV strains could have been finally recovered in Germany, through laborious, long-term co-cultivation of freshly isolated white blood cells from psychiatric inpatients with a human oligodendroglial cell line (OL cells) (Bode et al., 1996). Genetic analyses could validate both the identity of BDV RNA in the original samples and the corresponding isolates, and their authenticity as human viruses, as they differ genetically from the laboratory reference BDV strain V and another lab strain termed C6BV by few but distinct and meaningful mutations in each gene (de la Torre et al., 1996). Moreover, our previous metabonomic research has demonstrated that one of these human strains, BDV Hu-H1, which had been isolated from a severely depressed, hospitalized bipolar patient\u2019s PBMCs, perturbs energy metabolites in OL cells (Huang et al., 2012). Even more interesting, our group could have found last year that BDV Hu-H1 differed remarkably from the laboratory-adapted BDV strain V. In fact, BDV Hu-H1 inhibited proliferation and promoted apoptosis in OL cells, while strain V displayed the opposite effects (Li et al., 2013). Lab strain V was originally isolated from a diseased horse in Germany in the late 1920s, underwent numerous in vivo passages in rabbits and rats followed by multiple cell culture passaging.",

            "text": "OL cells are a cell line derived from fetal human oligodendrocytes and passaged at least 100 times. Oligodendrocytes are a major cellular component of the brain white matter that plays a pivotal role in maintaining neurological function via producing myelin proteins. Another human oligodendroglial cell line (HOG) derived from surgically removed oligodendrocytes was recent shown to be able to develop myelin-like sheaths (Bello-Morales et al., 2011). OL cells had successfully served as target cells for several neurotropic NNS RNA viruses, e.g. canine distemper virus (Muller et al., 1995), measles virus (Baczko et al., 1988), and BDV (Ibrahim et al., 2002, Qian et al., 2010). Although neurons are the major targets of BDV, the cell spectrum in the brain includes astroglia and oligodendroglia, as well (Carbone et al., 1993). Various cell types and viral strains have been shown to differentially affect BDV\u2019s influence on the host (Williams et al., 2008, Poenisch et al., 2009, Wu et al., 2013), including our above-mentioned study (Li et al., 2013). However, a better insight into the mechanism, how BDV and the human strain in particular the human BDV strain manipulates its host cells in vitro, should support our understanding of BDV\u2019s neuropathogenesis in vivo.",

            "text": "Up to now, mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics have been successfully applied to study the effects of viral infections on the host cell proteome (Zheng et al., 2011). For instance, proteomic profiling methods have revealed considerable pathophysiological changes in neurons infected with BDV laboratory strain He/80 (BDV He/80) (Suberbielle et al., 2008). However, no proteomic study has yet assessed a wild-type BDV strain, like the human virus BDV Hu-H1 and how infection impacts on the differential protein expression of host cells, like the human oligodendroglial cell line (OL cells). Therefore, in this study, we comparatively analyzed BDV Hu-H1- and non-infected OL cells by two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) followed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight-tandem mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS/MS) and further bioinformatics- and biochemistry-based methods. The study is focused on the identification of energy metabolites and mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling proteins.",

Metabolic flux studies have revealed that large DNA viruses like herpes viruses are able to actively redirect energy metabolism in the host cell rather than passively relying on basal host cell metabolic activity (Vastag et al., 2011). Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) and HSV-1 infection significantly perturb glycolysis, TCA cycle, and pentose phosphate pathway intermediates in host cells. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) has been shown to significantly upregulate host cell glycolysis (Diamond et al., 2010).

Therefore, five key Raf/MEK/ERK signaling proteins (i.e., p-Raf, p-MEK, p-ERK1/2, p-RSK, and p-MSK) were selected for Western blotting validation (Fig. 4a). P-ERK1/2 and p-RSK were found to be significantly up-regulated, and p-MSK was found to be significantly down-regulated, in OL/Hu-H1 cells compared to control cells; however, there was no significant dysregulation observed in p-Raf or p-MEK (Fig. 4b). These combined findings indicate that BDV Hu-H1 activates the downstream ERK\u2013RSK complex of the Raf/MEK/ERK signaling cascade in human OL cells (Fig. 4c). RSK, a substrate of ERK and a mediator of ERK signal transduction, is composed of two functional kinase domains that are activated in a sequential manner by a series of phosphorylations; MSK is a RSK-related kinase activated by ERK as well as p38 MAPK (Frodin and Gammeltoft, 1999). The activated ERK\u2013RSK complex observed here has several proposed functions, including: (i) regulation of gene expression through phosphorylation of transcriptional regulators, such as NF\u03baB/I\u03baB\u03b1, cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB), and CREB-binding protein; (ii) regulation of protein synthesis by phosphorylation of polyribosomal proteins and glycogen synthase kinase-3; and (iii) phosphorylation of the Ras GTP/GDP-exchange factor, Sos, leading to feedback inhibition of the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway (Frodin and Gammeltoft, 1999).",

            "text": "Many viruses manipulate the contributing kinases but differently in accord to their life cycles (Leong and Chow, 2006, Predmore, 2011, Vastag et al., 2011). Notably, BDV He/80 has also been shown to activate the Raf/MEK/ERK signaling cascade in several persistently-infected mammalian cell lines (Planz et al., 2001). In this study, BDV Hu-H1 was found to activate the ERK1/2 pathway, as well. As up-regulated pERK should increase the proliferation of cells (Seger and Krebs, 1995, Pearson et al., 2001), the CCK-8 experiment was conducted (Fig. 5) to detect proliferation and growth. In contrast to the higher ERK1/2 expression of BDV Hu-H1-infected OL cells, we found down-regulation of proliferation which was stronger than in uninfected control OL cells treated with ERK inhibitor U0126 which is apparently contradictory. However, a similar finding have been reported by Hans et al., namely that BDV activated the ERK1/2 pathway in a persistently-infected neural crest-derived cell line (PC12), but at the same time decreased the differentiation in PC cells, due to impaired translocation of ERK1/2 to the nucleus (Hans et al., 2001). We were able to show the same effects in pERK co-localization immunofluorescence assays, comparing OL/Hu-H1 cells and control OL cells (Fig. 6). Impaired translocation of key signal transduction kinases might be associated with the trafficking of viral proteins from the nucleus to the cytoplasm and vice versa, involved in nuclear replication, a unique feature of the family Bornaviridae among the order Mononegavirales (de la Torre, 1994).",

In addition, Western blotting validation demonstrated significant perturbation of the host\u2019s Raf/MEK/ERK signaling cascade: specifically, the downstream ERK\u2013RSK complex of the Raf/MEK/ERK signaling cascade was found to be activated by BDV Hu-H1 infection. Although BDV Hu-H1 produces constitutive activation of the ERK1/2 pathway, pERK\u2019s nuclear translocation was impaired.
