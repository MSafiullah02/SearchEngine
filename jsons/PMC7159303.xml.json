The eight goals address targets to increase incomes; reduce hunger; achieve universal primary education; eliminate gender inequality; reduce maternal and child mortality; reverse the spread of HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria; reverse the loss of natural resources and biodiversity; improve access to water, sanitation, and good housing; and establish effective global partnerships. Progress in some goals has been impressive; however, global targets will not be met in some regions, particularly sub-Saharan Africa and south Asia. As we approach the 2015 target date, there is considerable interest in assessment of the present goals and in consideration of the future of development goals after 2015.",

This interdisciplinary approach differs from previous MDG studies that have either examined individual goals or made broad sociopolitical assessments of the MDGs as a development mechanism. We used our analysis of cross-cutting challenges as the basis to identify a set of principles for future goal development, after 2015. We emphasise that this report is not an assessment of the MDGs; we focus deliberately on challenges with the implementation of the MDGs so as to inform future goal setting.",

They were not derived from an inclusive analysis and prioritisation of development needs, and this is reflected in the absence from them of a range of key development issues. The variable progress recorded with goals and targets partly indicates a tendency over time to focus on a subset of targets that have proven easier to implement and monitor, or which have stronger ownership by international or national institutions, or both. Complexity and lack of ownership have been particular problems for new targets added later in the MDG process. We provide short analyses of each MDG for those seeking more depth and to set out the evidence for a cross-MDG analysis (webappendix).",

However, MDGs have also encountered a range of common challenges. Challenges with the conceptualisation and execution of the MDGs arise at the three discrete levels on which they are constructed: goals, targets, and indicators. The very specific nature of many goals, reflecting their diverse, independent origins, leaves considerable gaps in coverage and fails to realise synergies that could arise across their implementation; we draw attention to particular synergies between education, health, poverty, and gender. In some cases, targets present a measure of goal achievement that is too narrow, or might not identify a clear means of delivery. Other challenges encountered by several MDGs include a lack of clear ownership and leadership internationally and nationally, and a problem with equity in particular. Issues of equity arise because many goals target attainment of a specific minimum standard\u2014eg, of income, education, or maternal or child survival. To bring people above this threshold might mean a focus on those for whom least effort is required, neglecting groups that, for geographical, ethnic, or other reasons, are more difficult to reach, thereby increasing inequity.",

By means of example, we conceptualise development as a dynamic process involving sustainable and equitable access to improved wellbeing, which is achieved by expansion of access to services that deliver the different elements of wellbeing. These elements can be defined in many ways, and would include those addressed in the MDGs. Instead of proposing a set of elements, and hence a new set of MDGs, we suggest a set of five principles by which development should be achieved. A holistic approach is needed to avoid gaps in the development agenda and ensure synergy between its interlinked components, each of which should address elements of human, social, and environmental development. Elements of wellbeing should be delivered to ensure equity of opportunity and outcome, recognising its complex and local nature, and addressing all communities while taking a deliberately pro-poor approach. This equity is a key feature of sustainability, as is a clear commitment to focusing productivity growth where it is needed. A broad development agenda arising from this process should be agreed internationally, but developed locally, to ensure ownership of goals and their monitoring across society nationally, regionally, and globally. This agenda should be based on a strong global obligation supported by effective international institutional frameworks.",

These goals have substantially shaped development dialogue and investment; some development agencies judge all their activities on the contribution to achievement of the MDGs.2\n",

Whereas MDG 1 (eradication of extreme poverty and hunger) is on course to be achieved and \u201cremarkable improvements\u201d have been made regarding aspects of MDG 6 (combating of HIV/AIDS, malaria, and other diseases), insufficient progress has been made towards achievement of MDG 2 (provision of universal primary education), MDG 4 (reduction of child mortality), and MDG 5 (reduction of maternal mortality).4, 5 Steps towards MDG 3 (promotion of gender equality and empowerment of women) have been labelled \u201csluggish\u201d; \u201calarmingly high\u201d rates of deforestation are hampering MDG 7 (ensuring of environmental sustainability); and Africa is \u201cshort-changed\u201d by the aid flows included under MDG 8 (development of a global partnership for development).4 Moreover, the global economic crisis has accentuated the urgency of the discussion, and progress is being jeopardised because of new financial constraints.6\n",

So far, analysis of the MDGs as models for international development has taken two forms. The first involves sector-specific assessment of progress towards individual MDGs, largely by sectoral experts.7, 8, 9, 10, 11 The second involves broader analysis of the MDGs as instruments of development, largely by international development specialists.3, 12, 13 We believe that an understanding of the MDGs and future improvements in goal setting benefits from consideration of all goals together, because they are so interconnected and because their individual implementation has identified many common issues. The purpose of this report is to identify challenges that have emerged in delivery of the MDGs that are common to different goals and to suggest how future goal setting can be improved to avoid these difficulties. We do not undertake to present a verdict on the MDGs, or a balanced assessment weighing advantages and disadvantages. We focus deliberately on problems with the MDGs to identify better future approaches. We will not propose specific changes in MDGs after 2015, but will suggest a set of principles that might guide future goal development. This Commission is intended for a broad readership interested in all MDGs and for a more health-focused readership, who we hope will gain an improved understanding of the important relations between health and other MDG targets.",

LIDC is dedicated to novel, intersectoral, and interdisciplinary approaches to international development. The Commission was co-designed with The Lancet, coordinated by LIDC, and prepared by experts in three LIDC member institutions: the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, Institute of Education, and School of Oriental and African Studies, and their research partners in South Africa, Zambia, Malawi, India, and Thailand. This team brought specific, individual expertise with MDGs 1\u20137, from different development perspectives and backgrounds. To build a team approach, each expert was asked with her or his partners to write a critique of their MDG and to contribute ideas arising from this analysis towards the design of future development goals. All participants read these papers as preparation for a 2-day facilitated workshop that identified issues and challenges that cut across the MDGs and built a consensus about future development goal setting. During four subsequent, smaller workshops, this consensus was developed into a final document. Although overseas partners could participate only in the first main workshop, all contributed towards subsequent development and have made contributions to the final version, including specific case studies. Analyses of individual MDGs are provided (webappendix) for readers interested in more detail. They provide the evidence base for the cross-cutting analysis.",

            "text": "The immediate antecedent of the MDGs was the Millennium Declaration, presented in 2000 at the UN Millennium Summit.15 The Millennium Declaration presented six values that were considered to be fundamental to international relations in the 21st century: freedom, equality, solidarity, tolerance, respect for nature, and shared responsibility. Seven key objectives were identified to translate these shared values into actions: peace, security, and disarmament; development and poverty eradication; protection of our common environment; human rights, democracy, and good governance; protection of vulnerable people; meeting of the special needs of Africa; and strengthening of the UN. The second objective, development and poverty eradication, was translated into eleven resolutions, presented as development targets. Many of these targets had legacies that predated the Millennium Declaration and had arisen from sector-specific UN-sponsored and other world conferences and summits during the previous decades. Most had appeared as international development targets in the report of the Development Assistance Committee (DAC) of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Shaping the 21st century: the contribution of development cooperation.16 The OECD's international development targets were particularly influential in the determination of the relevant text of the Millennium Declaration. With the addition of a few more targets, particularly for environmental sustainability, these became the MDGs. In turn these targets were linked post hoc with indicators, for the purposes of measurement, and with goals, for the purpose of conceptual simplicity. By 2001 the MDG framework comprised eight goals, 18 targets, and 48 indicators.17 A few more targets and indicators were added later, creating the set presented in panel 1\n.Panel 1The Millennium

Several recent analyses have provided a useful insight into how the MDGs represent an integration of different international development strategies and initiatives emerging over recent decades. Hulme,19 for instance, suggests that the MDGs developed through an interaction between, on the one hand, a US-led, neo-liberal ideology (one that promotes economic growth based on free trade and markets) linked to results-based management and, on the other hand, a development approach of some other wealthy countries, multilaterals, and non-governmental organisation (NGOs) that focused on multidimensional human development\u2014eg, health, education, and gender equity, treating these as both development goals and development means. The emerging goals are biased towards a human development approach\u2014\u201cfive and a half of the eight MDGs are about enhancing human capabilities\u201d19\u2014and there is a strong emphasis on basic needs. However, they also incorporate neo-liberal thinking about economic growth into their important poverty goal (MDG 1), and their overall results-based framework focused greatly on international development partnerships. Manning3 observes how the early neo-liberal leanings of the goals were tempered by recognition of the need for buy-in by developing countries and by NGOs, leading to the inclusion of goals more focused on human welfare and development, such as health and education.",

The former involves \u201can association of States joined together through their common respect for a set of rules, norms and standard practices which govern the relationships between them\u201d whereas the latter involves \u201can association of States joined together in a cooperative venture to promote common ends\u201d.13 With this target focus came an important shift from maximalist views of development (in which development involves poorer countries achieving aspirations of equality with richer countries) to minimalist standards (of proportions of people crossing poverty thresholds or accessing particular services or avoiding mortality or morbidity); and from societal and national change to changes for individuals within nation states. The emphasis on specific and minimalist targets, and the way in which it narrowed the development agenda and placed particular responsibilities on developing country governments, has generated many of the challenges facing implementation of the MDGs.",

Their targets are often so narrow as to neglect important development issues in the same sector\u2014eg, tertiary education, reproductive health, and a range of gender issues.

The elements taken into the MDGs were in fact the specific targets associated with only one objective of the Declaration, that of development and poverty eradication. Some of these goals, being themselves derived from specific targets, were very narrow in conception: education goals focused mainly on primary education, whereas health goals focused only on three aspects of health associated with maternal mortality, child mortality, and specific diseases. For goals that were more broadly defined, such as poverty reduction, gender, or environmental sustainability, the few targets assigned to them did not capture their breadth. The consequences of building goals around targets were two-fold. First, very substantial gaps existed in the coverage of goals, with targets failing to address important development needs for that sector.

Did this leave us unprepared for the food price crisis of 2007 and the need to make food security a global agenda? The focus of MDG 2 on primary education and enrolment has led in some countries to a so-called policy myopia, and a neglect of both learning level achievement and of secondary and post-secondary education, with important implications for economic growth. MDG 3's very narrow scope failed to capture several intrinsic women's rights issues such as freedom from violence and adult literacy, which are two areas of extreme inequality.

Although investment in vertical health programmes could bring resources, such as new health centres, that benefit health systems overall, their focus on particular diseases means that other national needs might be unsupported. For example, a study in Mali found that a campaign to treat neglected tropical diseases disrupted basic health services at health centres because of staff absences; and in 14 of 16 health centres staff were overburdened by the additional requirements of the campaign.35 Similarly, vertical programmes bring investment in accounting and procurement services that could strengthen national health systems generally, but which could in practice be limited to servicing specific disease programmes, running in parallel to weak national systems. In countries where human resources are scarce, such as most low-income countries, staff move to where salaries, incentives, and working conditions are best. Thus although allocation for disease-specific funding might increase human resources in health systems, human resources might be drawn into specific programmes, neglecting other parts of the health system.",

But education's relations with poverty, health, and gender are reciprocal. Children from poorer households enrol in fewer years of education, and in many systems poor girls enrol in fewer years than do poor boys.9 Better child health and nutrition improve educational outcomes.40, 41 These gender interactions are typical of those across the MDGs.

This convergence is made less likely by the reality that goals are compartmentalised into responsibilities of different line ministries nationally, subnationally, and locally, which means that the potential for simultaneous actions in the same location, working with the same communities and households, is unlikely. However, precedents for such synergy can arise from targeted interventions in the same communities. For example, the Mid-day Meal programme reaches 120 million primary school children every school day in India and provides a cooked meal. The introduction of this nutrition programme has greatly raised school attendance43 and, in conjunction with agricultural services, can stimulate farm input and output markets and agricultural development.",

            "text": "MDG 2 provides a particularly clear example of how specific targets can be met without achieving their full intent. For this goal, the measurable target identified for achievement of universal primary education is to ensure that, by 2015, all boys and girls are able to complete a full course of primary schooling. This target is accompanied by three indicators, of which only the first, the net enrolment ratio, has been consistently measured, because the others are more difficult to assess. Hence progress on MDG 2 has been represented by changes in this ratio. However, this measure entails a very narrow view of primary education. In some contexts, enrolment in education, even in the last grade of primary, can mean little more than having one's name recorded in an enrolment register. The ratio does not indicate regular attendance, participation in learning opportunities, or the achievement of learning outcomes that are useful, relevant, or enduring as the child develops into adolescence and adulthood. Nor do measures or indicators of targets indicate what types of actions might have been, or could be, taken to increase performance, such as teacher supply, teacher education, language policy reform, curriculum reform, or provision of learning materials. Panel 2\nshows some of these challenges, with a particular example from India.Panel 2difficulties with targets for MDG 2 in IndiaThe target for MDG 2 aims to have all children completing a full course of primary schooling. For India, estimates suggest that close to 95% of children aged 6\u201314 years are enrolled in school.45 The Indian Government has a policy of automatic promotion from one grade to the next each year, which implies that it is not difficult for enrolled children to move from grade 1 to grade 5.But is enrolment a good measure for understanding who is in school regularly? Several studies have shown that despite very high enrolment, regular attendance in school is an issue of major concern in some states. Government data from 2006 show that in 11 of the 20 major states, average attendance in primary school was less than 80%.46 When measured very carefully, findings from the SchoolTELLS study showed that for the school year 2007\u201308, in the schools sampled for the study, only 25% of enrolled children in Bihar and 44% in Uttar Pradesh attended school regularly.47 The visit of researchers from Assessment Survey Evaluation Research (ASER) in 2009 to a school on a random day indicated that attendance was lower than 80% in ten of 20 major states, with numbers below 60% being recorded in populous and educationally underperforming states such as Uttar Pradesh and Bihar.45 In poor regions, despite incentives such as free school meals, uniforms, scholarships, and textbooks, children are not regularly in school. Stable and regular attendance patterns are an essential condition for effective teaching and learning. Closer tracking of attendance needs to be a high priority for state governments in India.No national longitudinal study has been done in India that follows successive cohorts of children from the first year until the last year of primary school or beyond, so the primary school completion target is difficult to measure accurately. With the assumption that a large majority of children actually do complete primary schooling, assessment of what benefits the achievement of this target would represent is crucial, given that the MDG goal does not include a universal learning target. For the past 5 years the ASER survey has been measuring basic reading levels across India. ASER 2009 reports that only 52\u00b78% of rural children in India in standard five can fluently read text at standard two level.45 The situation for mathematics is even more dismal. Less than 40% of children in standard five can do a numerical division problem (three digit by one digit division) correctly. Most states in India expect children to reach this level by the end of standard three or four. Therefore by the time that an average rural Indian child completes the primary stage she or he is at least 2\u20133 years academically behind where she or he is expected to be. At least half of all children in India are leaving primary school not being able to read fluently or do basic arithmetic operations. Where does this evidence point us? What needs to be done to ensure a meaningful completion of primary school? Criteria for measurement of progress towards the completion goal have to include methods and mechanisms to assess children's and teachers' attendance in schools regularly. Next, clear learning goals need to be articulated. It is against these benchmarks of enrolment, attendance, survival, and learning that the MDG 2 goal of completion needs to be measured.",

            "text": "Once targets are seen to be achieved, attention may be directed elsewhere. If target achievement falls short of goal achievement, then it is possible that further progress will not be made against that goal. In panel 3\n, we show this risk with an example of MDG 3 from South Africa.Panel 3Achievement of MDG 3 in South AfricaInternationally, the MDGs act as a powerful public relations exercise. While governments have their own national goals and targets developed and responsive to a national political dynamic, pressure to meet the international development goals is particularly strong because it exposes government performance in a global arena. This pressure has the advantage of holding national political leaders to account against clearly quantifiable targets, but can also lead to governments manipulating statistics or to complacency by which targets seem to be met.One problem with ticking off the indicator for a target as a success is that it may blunt initiatives to fulfil wider dimensions of the goal. A focus on quantity might aim to include as many people as possible in the benefits associated with a particular target. However, losing qualitative dimensions means that important aspects of realising the full dimensions of the goal are lost.Some aspects of this effect are illustrated in a study of South Africa's response to MDG 3. The indicators associated with the target for MDG 3\u2014to eliminate gender disparity in primary and secondary education\u2014have been met.9, 48 South Africa has achieved gender parity in primary net enrolment ratio, the proportion of boys and girls who complete 5 years of primary schooling, and in literacy rates in young adults. More young women are in secondary and tertiary education than are young men. But these achievements against the indicators provide only a small insight into the broader goal.Interviews undertaken with officials in the national Department of Education and a provincial Ministry in 2008 and 2009 as part of the Gender, Education and Global Poverty Reduction Initiatives research project indicated that South Africa was proud of having met the quantitative targets for gender parity, but that for several officials this was sufficient achievement on gender issues, and that other areas should get more priority.49 Schools are assumed to promote equity simply by having achieved parity, and so their complicity in perpetuating inequitable gender relations often goes unacknowledged. As a result, data from the Gender, Education and Global Poverty Reduction Initiatives project indicate that teachers and government officials locate the source of gender problems in the family, both in terms of blame and responsibility for finding solutions.However, several studies document how, despite policy declarations which stress the importance of gender and race equality, South African schools are sites of gender discrimination.50 This discrimination is manifest in school regimes that do not question, but in fact reproduce, norms associated with male achievement and female subordination. The difficulties for teachers in using the curriculum to question and change these assumptions are compounded by employment practices, which often make it difficult for women, who make up a large part of the teaching profession, to gain promotion.51 Although the HIV epidemic offered many opportunities for schools to engage in reflection on questions of sex and gender, and some creative engagements emerged, it was often very difficult to challenge deeply-held assumptions. Many studies identify practices of gender-based violence in schools or associated with teachers and the policy challenges that these entail.52, 53, 54 Clearly education policy concerned with promotion of greater equality needs to recognise the ways in which schooling encourages inequitable gendered relations and the ways in which policies and practices might themselves constitute gender relationships. Working with the MDG framework means that a country can have fulfilled the target, but this does not always achieve the spirit of the goal.",

MDG 7 has a similar problem in that it has targets that encourage policies which reduce the loss of biodiversity and other natural resources, as outcomes, but it has no output targets in terms of policy interventions. Targets with these problems have less chance of effective execution than do others, since they are based only on observation of outcomes.",

Panel 4\nshows how the Government of Malawi has made use of the MDGs. Other national plans that were able to be incorporated into the MDGs included Vision 2025 in Tanzania and Vision 2020 in Rwanda.22\nPanel 4National implementation of MDGs in MalawiMalawi has been orienting its development activities towards the achievement of the MDGs. This shift is evident from the development strategies that have been formulated by the government, the articulation of the development strategy in the budget process, and the commitment to monitor progress on the indicators of the MDGs.The MDGs in Malawi are implemented through a medium-term development strategy known as the Malawi Growth and Development Strategy for 2006\u201311; its overall goal is to reduce poverty through sustainable economic growth and infrastructure development. The strategy focuses on six key priority areas: agriculture and food security; irrigation and water development; transport infrastructure development; energy generation and supply; integrated rural development; and prevention and management of nutrition disorders and HIV/AIDS.57 There is a clear articulation about how the focus on these six priority areas is to contribute to the achievement of the MDGs. The budget framework is also fully aligned to the strategy, and by implication to the achievement of the MDGs, by being framed in such a way that it reflects expenditure allocations to pro-poor sectors in Malawi.Since 2006, Malawi has been monitoring its progress towards the achievement of the MDGs and assessment of the possibility of achieving the targets by 2020. The Government of Malawi, through the Ministry of Planning and Development Cooperation, publishes the Malawi MDGs report every year. The most recent 2008 Malawi MDGs report documents remarkable progress in many areas and projects that some of the goals are likely to be achieved by 2020. Progress has been registered in eradication of extreme poverty (MGD 1); reduction of child mortality (MGD 4); and combating of HIV/AIDS, malaria, and other diseases (MDG 6); while daunting challenges remain in improving maternal health, achieving universal primary education, promoting gender equality, and empowerment of women. In terms of achieving the MDGs, the recent assessment shows that Malawi is likely to meet the 2020 target for MDGs 1, 4, 6, and 7, while MDGs 3 and 5 are unlikely to be met and MDG 2 is potentially feasible.58\nThe very substantial progress that has been made in MDG 1 in reduction of the proportion of the population in extreme poverty from 53\u00b79% in 2000 to 45% in 2006 has been achieved because of several interventions\u2014eg, the implementation of the agricultural input subsidy, introduction of social support programmes for vulnerable groups, pro-poor allocation of public expenditures, and macroeconomic management leading to positive economic growth rates in the past 5 years. These interventions have been assisted by good weather and high tobacco prices, and high political will to implement pro-poor programmes. The implementation of the agricultural input subsidy has enabled the country to produce more food, with the stunting and wasting of children younger than 5 years falling from 6\u00b74% and 6\u00b78%, respectively, in 2005, to 4\u00b79% and 5\u00b78% in 2007. Poverty reduction and food security have been at the centre of the political and development agenda of the country, and MDG 1 has added impetus to the implementation of programmes aimed at reducing poverty in the country.",

            "text": "For low-income countries, however, the donor resources associated with the MDGs can be attractive to governments that are struggling to meet their own strategic targets. For example, the provision of antiretroviral treatment for HIV/AIDS\u2014an element of MDG 6\u2014has been favoured by donors such as PEPFAR, but not always as a priority in country-led health strategies. Panel 5\nshows how the national health strategy of Zambia has shifted to improve incorporation of this and other MDG targets. Although this approach could be seen as donor-driven distortion of national strategy, it also is indicative of a pragmatic national desire to develop beneficial health strategies that have a high chance of successful implementation.Panel 5The Zambian national health goals and MDGsThe Zambian Fifth National Development Plan is the means by which the government ensures progress toward the attainment of MDG goals, with progress tracked and reported by the Ministry of Finance and the UN Country Team. A review of the National Health Strategic Plan (NHSP) shows the great extent to which the MDGs have affected health planning.In 1992, Zambia began implementing Health Sector Reform, with the vision to \u201cprovide the people of Zambia with equity of access to cost-effective, quality healthcare as close to the family as possible\u201d guided by the NHSP. Although the 2001\u201305 NHSP reaffirmed the health vision, principles, and overall health goals of the Health Sector Reforms,61 the theme adopted for the 2006\u201310 NHSP was entitled \u201cTowards the Attainment of the Millennium Development Goals and National Health Priorities\u201d, indicating close alignment with the MDGs.62 This alignment is reflected in the fact that seven of the 12 national health priorities focused on public health priorities whereas five directly addressed the three health MDGs.63 However, although these priority areas were specifically singled out for special attention, the NHSP did include other health-care interventions.Zambia's strategic alignment with the MDGs has benefited from the increased donor support for HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria that was received in the first decade of the 21st century. The availability of financial and technical resources from donors such as the Global Fund, the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), and the World Bank's Zambia National Response to HIV/AIDS (ZANARA) programme, among others, underpinned to a large extent the progress that has been documented towards attainment of MDG 6 directly. Particularly striking has been the progress made towards achievement of universal access to treatment for HIV/AIDS for all those who need it. By the end of 2008, 200 435 adults were estimated to be receiving antiretroviral drugs, representing 66\u00b73% of the estimated need.63 However, although the prevalence of HIV fell slightly to 14\u00b73% in 200764 compared with 15\u00b76% in 2002,65 the results of the 2009 epidemiological synthesis study suggest continued transmission of infection, with 1\u00b76% of the adult population becoming newly infected every year.66\nThis finding implies that to get close to attainment of the 2015 targets there needs to be a renewed focus on prevention of new infections. The National Prevention Strategy articulates the key drivers of the epidemic in Zambia and will guide the prevention efforts in the next 5 years.67 Overall, the 2008 National Progress Report on the MDGs suggests that, with the exception of MDG 7, the country is likely or potentially likely to attain the MDGs by 2015.68 However, continued reliance on external donor support implies that the sector is vulnerable to the global economic climate, as has been experienced in 2009. The ability to maintain any gains in health indicators after 2015 needs planning that will target the long-term sustainable development of the economy.",

Finally, there is a phase in which much greater effort and resources are needed to make further improvements.

In many settings, wealth quintiles effectively indicate other inequities within a society. They draw attention to differences in key markers of access and outcome between those who do and do not have material assets, which provide a mechanism to examine differences between countries in terms of how these assets are distributed. Some specific measures of inequalities in wealth have been developed, such as the Gini coefficient which measures the extent to which distribution of wealth is uneven. Other measures are the ratio of the incomes of the richest 10% or 20% of the population compared with the poorest 10% or 20%.72\n",

However, wealth quintiles have been used extensively in analyses of health-related MDGs undertaken by the World Bank, UNICEF, and others,73, 74 and very recently in work into the distribution of education enrolment rates.9 But wealth, income, or consumption are not the only features of inequity. Factors such as geography and ethnic origin might be more important in identification of inequities, both in access and outcome of health interventions.75 In rural Papua New Guinea and Ethiopia, the most important determinant of access to health care, and health outcomes, may be geography. Asset indices do not always predict health outcomes. In some settings, geography, ethnic origin, or other factors might be more dominant factors.

The outcome of such an emergency, especially when children are involved, is strongly affected by the extent of women's empowerment within a community.76 Several studies in high-income countries show that inequality is often associated with other social ills. Wilkinson and Pickett78 associate inequality in income with a range of aspects of ill health, such as low life expectancy, mental health problems, and obesity, and markers of social dislocation such as violence and imprisonment. They argue that societies with large gaps between rich and poor people have adverse consequences for everyone, including those who earn well.

This inequity is the case for all targets that focus on changing the proportion of people experiencing a particular hardship\u2014eg, reducing the maternal mortality ratio or the proportion of people living on less than $1 a day. Even when these MDG targets are achieved, a proportion of the population would remain below a line of adequacy and the inequities within a society would not be resolved. Reduction of the number of people living on $1 a day or less will relieve some people from extreme poverty, but only just.

For example, in India in 2005, children achieved an average 7\u00b75 years in school, nearly completing a cycle of primary and elementary education. Children from the richest quintile, both boys and girls, completed on average 11 years of schooling, whereas boys from the poorest quintile completed 5 years of schooling, and girls completed only 3 years.9 Thus, although India was on track to meet the MDG 2 target, inequities in educational opportunities were being perpetuated between different population groups, and between the sexes. For MDG 7, improvements in access to improved sanitation are substantial, but are also strongly associated with the wealthiest quintiles of the population.4 Health interventions associated with MDGs 4, 5, and 6 are mainly applied through established health services, tending to favour the same individuals who have been covered by previous interventions. They might live near the road or the health post, have relatives who have been trained as health workers, or have access to information. Those who are both geographically and socially far away from the rest of the population do not receive the intervention. A district level study80 of child mortality in Tanzania since 1988 draws attention to the fact that in a poor African country that has made admirable progress towards child survival, there is substantial variability in the progress made, and the districts that were doing well in 1988 improved at a greater rate than did the poorer districts. Thus the improved child survival that Tanzania has recorded has been at the expense of worsening geographical inequity.80\n",

Hence we focus on what might come after the MDGs, in view of the MDG experience. This is not to belittle in any way the importance of trying to achieve the existing MDGs in the next 5 years. Our premise is that, whether or not present MDGs are continued, modified, or replaced after 2015, we should move forward having learned the lessons of the previous 15 years, and addressed any weaknesses that have become apparent in MDGs. In part 1, we examined individual MDGs and identified their specific challenges, which we used in part 2 to draw out common challenges that cut across the goals. We found that the core challenges relate to reducing gaps and fragmentation in the MDGs, enhancing their integration, improving targeting and indicators, and ensuring equity and ownership. The reasons for fragmentation, incoherence, and gaps in the existing MDGs lie in their origins; although they included goals from a range of sectors, a common, cross-sectoral vision of development was not the basis for their formulation. Rather, as we have noted in part 1, the specific goals that emerged from the MDG formulation process were largely targets established in independent, earlier sectoral initiatives, grouped together and edited for political sensitivity, to maximise broad international support. Looking forward, we consider that any project after 2015 should be built on a coherent and shared approach to development, which can guide action across different sectors including, but not confined to, addressing poverty, inequity, and environmental degradation, and improving gender equity, education, and health.",

While this approach captures a range of development perspectives, it generates a poorly aligned mixture of means, ends, and sometimes competing ideas about normative aspiration (eg, economic growth vs sustainability), which has made the MDG project less useful than it could have been, since opportunities to link the goals together coherently have been missed and a rigorous approach to assessment has been overlooked.",

Hence, we are seeking to make operational some of the ideas that Amartya Sen outlines in The Idea of Justice.95 Sen's argument is that elaboration of a vision of global justice at the present moment, when there are no appropriate institutions to deliver this vision, might be deemed an exercise in ideal theory; however, it is nonetheless important to focus on the choices that are actually on offer in a globally inter-related world, the plurality of principles and interpretations that might play a part in view of the different histories and contexts of people, and the permissibility of partial resolutions (ie, that making some things a bit better rather than waiting for the best resolution) could be an important step.

            "text": "Drawing from this method of assessment of existing human relationships, and identification of means and ends, we define development as a dynamic process involving sustainable and equitable access to improved wellbeing. This conceptualisation needs brief elaboration. There are many elements of wellbeing and increasing published work on its application and measurement.92, 96, 97 Sen views wellbeing as a combination of the aspiration that \u201chuman lives can go much better\u201d and an understanding that improvement can be brought about through a strengthening of human agency, a person's capability to pursue and realise things that he or she values and has reason to value.98 Unlike conventional economics that equate wellbeing with happiness, Sen's capability approach suggests that aspects of wellbeing have to consider the things that we really value (whether they make us happy or not) and levels of deprivation, whether or not people report they are happy despite severe want. By suggesting that wellbeing is linked with capabilities\u2014that is the freedom to enjoy various combinations of beings and doings\u2014Sen draws attention to the significance of how different people necessarily have need of and make use of resources in diverse ways.97 To consider heterogeneity as part of any evaluation of the freedom people have is therefore crucial. Social arrangements for development are thus to be assessed not in the space of resources (inputs) or of outcomes (happiness) but in relation to wellbeing, agency, and capabilities\u2014that is the freedom to promote and achieve functionings that people value. In adoption of an understanding of wellbeing that derives from Sen's ideas, we define wellbeing as the freedoms and capability to make choices and act effectively with respect to, for example, health, education, nutrition, employment, security, participation, voice, consumption, and the claiming of rights. For each of these elements of wellbeing, there are important considerations of quality and quantity of achievement, of diversity in aspirations between different communities, of equity, and in some of these aspects (most notably those concerned with material consumption) of the need to recognise satisfaction from sufficient (as opposed to maximised) achievement, as diminishing marginal returns to consumption are overtaken by increasing marginal costs (including social costs). This approach helps access to improved wellbeing to be both equitable and sustainable. In this section we will discuss the nature and implications of equity and sustainability, but note here their importance as intrinsic features of our development notion.",

The classification of services provided by the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment99 is particularly useful, since it makes a distinction between moderating (or regulating), provisioning, supportive, and cultural services. This typology has wider applicability beyond the provision of ecosystem services by natural capital (eg, forests, soils, wetlands, oceans). Thus physical capital (eg, infrastructure and equipment), human capital (eg, knowledge, skills, labour), and social capital (eg, institutions, relationships) all generate moderating (or regulatory) services that provide stability, promote resilience, and reduce systems' sensitivity to change. Similarly, these different types of capital also generate provisioning or productive services (producing goods and services for direct or indirect consumption), supporting services (supporting conditions necessary for and underpinning systems' existence and functioning), and cultural services (which provide communicative, aesthetic, recreational, or spiritual benefits). Finally, development has to be explicitly and fundamentally seen as a dynamic process of change. This view involves a plurality of perspectives with several stakeholders, who interact as individuals within and between households, organisations, communities, and nations, with differing resources and aspirations.

Further, this agreement was reached building on some of the optimistic realignments of the 1990s in the aftermath of the end of the Cold War as a centralised process led by more powerful players with a pragmatic acceptance of the lowest common set of goals and indicators, defined to allow sometimes loose and sometimes narrow interpretations. However, any future project to develop the MDGs will be located in a very different global political economy characterised by the events after Sept 11, 2001, the emergence of a new security agenda, the effects of the financial crises, the emergence of China and India as significant economic and geopolitical players, and extreme caution about what global agreements can achieve in view of the failures of the Doha round on trade agreements and the Copenhagen conference on climate change.",

This approach will not be easy, but several development issues make the MDGs' focus on a set of goals aimed at increasing the material consumption of poor people less tenable. We draw attention to, for example, a growing acceptance of the need to address population growth, to recognise and restrict the environmental effect of human activities, and to understand the limitations of growth based on capitalism and neo-liberalism as a system for delivery of sustainable development. These issues have been ones for which comprehensive agreement is difficult to obtain from states with different ideologies and political systems, but they can no longer be avoided. Unterhalter and Carpentier101 set out this challenge in terms of a so-called development tetralemma faced in the pursuit of mechanisms and systems that simultaneously promote equity, growth, democracy, and sustainability (in which a tetralemma is defined as analogous to a dilemma, but involving a set of four crucially important options for which each is necessary but not sufficient for sustainable development, and they cannot all be achieved together). Almost all present political and economic mechanisms and systems can only achieve some of these at the expense of others; hence they are compromised even in their initial achievements. Experience of the Copenhagen negotiations in December, 2009, on climate change targets and measures shows the difficulties in getting international agreements on complex and politically sensitive issues affecting international and intergenerational investments and concerned with countries' differing and evolving domestic aspirations and perceptions of rights and responsibilities.102, 103\n",

Figure 1\nshows how this tenet can be viewed in terms of three core dimensions of wellbeing. It suggests that people's wellbeing and capabilities depend on human development (change in their individual human conditions and resources), social development (change in their social relations and resources), and environmental development (change in their access to and relations with natural and environmental resources). Progress on each of these areas is crucial for people's wellbeing, but they are also closely related to and dependent on each other. A formulation of development goals should start from these individual and interlinked dimensions. We also note that achievement of human, social, and environmental development as set out in figure 1 is dependent on underpinning development of physical capital and, in view of the global challenges noted earlier, population stabilisation.

Sen has argued that aspects of equality, whether these are related to rights to hold property, vote, or earn the same level of income, are a core component of ideas about justice in the contemporary world.105 Although differences might exist with regard to what type of equality is valued or emphasised, equality in some space is a central aspiration, and the notion of equity distils the types of social relations entailed in ensuring this aim. Drawing on changing meanings of the word equity in English from the 14th century, Unterhalter106 has identified three different levels of equity comprising equity from above, which needs a fair system of institutional arrangements; equity from below, which entails processes of participation and discussion; and equity from the middle, which ensures the efficient flow of services, information, and investment.

In education, they include providing appropriately sited schools, making universal opportunities for school attendance, and access to the curriculum through an appropriate language policy and training sufficient teachers. In health, provision of these services means building sufficient health facilities, training staff, and ensuring a supply of drugs. For the environment, it means providing access to clean water and air, and harvestable natural resources resulting from the responsible management of land and water. However, the mere provision of these institutional arrangements does not go far enough if there is inadequate attention to the quality of provision, or if the needs of the most disadvantaged groups are greater than the rest.

Sustainable action should be a practice of all stakeholders who have power over the resources a system uses, and it will apply to all scales (eg, from households to nations, from fields and small stream catchments to river basins). Such sustainable action is hard to achieve, but is made easier when different services can substitute for each other to improve sustainability. For example, the sustainability of nutrition as an element of wellbeing can be supported by development of improved agricultural and environmental systems, by improved trade and the equitable distribution of foodstuffs, or by changes in personal livelihoods or behaviour that give individuals more reserves to survive periods of want.

Therefore, all stakeholders with (formal or informal) control over resources need to have the ability and incentives to support the maintenance of the system. We draw attention to two implications from this tenet. First, growth in productivity is crucial for the sustainability of many systems, but not a necessary feature of all systems, and the nature and rate of growth needed in a system will vary with the aspirations of stakeholders, changing pressures on systems, and socioeconomic structures and relations. Thus increasing population and aspirations for substantial improvements in wellbeing for poor people makes strong demands for productivity growth, but economic growth associated with increases in material consumption will not be as important for some advanced economies and their sustainability. This notion brings us back to our discussion in part 2 of this report of targets and the important, but widely misunderstood, distinction between global and national targets. Although the sustainability of the planet needs substantial reductions in productivity growth globally, the poorest countries might need to achieve high productivity growth to raise the incomes of the poorest. Second, both equity and ownership are needed in the management of systems and the returns that they offer to different stakeholders. Failure of crucial stakeholders to perceive that they or others benefit fairly from a system will lead to their withdrawal of resources from that system and its eventual collapse. The requirements of sustainability are therefore inextricably linked with our other principles of holism, equity, ownership, and global obligation.",

Therefore we advocate the use of our growing understanding of equity to focus on the most disadvantaged sections\u2014the equivalent of a pro-poor approach. Wealth quintiles have found useful application to the MDGs, particularly with respect to poverty and health targets.73, 74 Analyses based on this approach have been instrumental in drawing attention to the extent to which recent progress in many areas has been at the expense of growing inequity. However, when applied nationally, results based on wealth quintiles do not always seem to make sense. Sometimes this situation arises because the key drivers of inequity are factors other than economic poverty, so economic poverty might understate the disparities that exist. At other times they point to fundamental problems with the data itself, such as systematic under-reporting. In some African countries, reported levels of neonatal and infant mortality are substantially lower in the poorest quintiles than some of the wealthier ones.119 This effect is almost certainly due to systematic under-reporting in the poorest and most marginalised groups, who are likely to be suspicious of young data collectors coming from the cities. Adjustment for these effects would produce a more accurate, but less welcome estimate of child mortality for the affected countries.",

Economic inequity (or poverty in its narrowest definition) is the most important dimension in many settings, yet it is not always captured by analyses based on wealth. From the perspective of uptake of health services, what really matters is access to cash when it is needed to take care of an unexpected illness in the family. Furthermore, the cash must be accessible for the person taking care of the sick individual\u2014eg, a mother taking care of her child, or a woman needing ongoing treatment for a chronic disease. Too often women do not have access to cash. Thus, gender becomes an important determinant of inequity. Systematic disempowerment of women is a pervasive barrier to development in all areas, most particularly health and education. In some settings, particular ethnic groups are also disadvantaged, and unless this inequity is highlighted and understood, such groups cannot be effectively targeted.",

In other settings, geographic factors, ethnic origin, or gender can be important determinants of inequity. Simple methods are needed to enable countries to decide which factors are most important for them, and to monitor inequities in health, education, and other areas by monitoring one or more of the key determinants, as interventions are being implemented. Monitoring of inequities in both opportunities and outcomes will enable countries to understand whether existing or future programmes are reducing or indeed increasing inequity. For example, in some countries, a detailed analysis of factors associated with child mortality would likely show that, although socioeconomic factors have a role, with low risk recorded in the wealthiest quintile, a more important determinant of mortality risk is living in an area with no effective health services. On the basis of such an analysis, the government might then elect to monitor intervention coverage and mortality in a representative sample of such areas to ensure that as mortality is reduced nationally, the equity gap between the highest risk and lowest risk groups is also narrowed.

In view of present rates of economic growth and continuing population expansion, sustained development assistance for health and considerable additional domestic finance are needed if we are to move towards the collective national and international aspirations for health even over the next decades. Most health expenditure in low-income countries still comes from private, mostly out-of-pocket payments (mean of $13 per head in 2006), with domestic government budgets contributing an average of $12, and development assistance making a smaller but important contribution of $6.33 The goal of the above health intervention and system strengthening initiatives is to plan, design, and build an efficient, equitable, and responsive health system without the distorting effects and special pleading of particular interest groups. Sector-wide approaches to financing encourage all interested partners, both domestic governmental and external investors, to pool their resources so that one health plan can be implemented, monitored, and reported upon. The challenge that has arisen in some countries is that when domestic budgets are tightened, and external donors do not meet their expected contributions, there are not enough resources for all. In this situation the fixed recurrent costs, particularly salaries, still have to be met, and as a result funds for services and commodities are unavailable, leading to shortages and stock-outs even for those activities that are seen as key priorities within the plan. Thus, proponents of specific interventions\u2014such as vaccination for children, or completion of tuberculosis treatment to prevent emergence of costly drug resistance\u2014have good grounds to advocate for protected funding for a few key programmes.
