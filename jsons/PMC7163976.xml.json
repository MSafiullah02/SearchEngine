The widespread adoption of principles of sustainability, the increasing commitment of diverse nations to international protocols for achieving global environmental and humanitarian goals, and the spread of participatory democracy can all be attributed in part to the benefits of globalization. But globalization also has negative consequences, which come about, for example, through unregulated flows of capital and the ability of both countries and transnational corporations to wield power at the global scale (Eakin and Lemos 2006).",

We argue, therefore, that vulnerabilities are interdependent through the mechanisms that increase exposure or sensitivity, as well as the processes that affect capacities. These mechanisms are shown in Figure 1: first, the processes of global environmental change; second, the changing structure of economic markets; and, third, material flows of resources, people, and information.",

Due to the global nature of environmental change processes, which have accelerated during the past century in particular, the impacts of environmental change in one locality are increasingly connected to regional and global systems through human action and response. In what ecologists have termed the \u201caggregation effect\u201d (O'Neill 1988), shifts in the rate and spatial scope of environmental change, both globally and locally, have the effect of increasing the potential for local\u2010level influences on global biophysical processes.

Ecologists have noted that, in nested systems, there are critical points or thresholds at which local change is more likely to have an aggregate influence (O'Neill and King 1998). For example, there are real and increasingly recognized thresholds in the impacts of climate change, characterized as non\u2010linear changes in ecosystems and physical systems and brought about through flips in ecosystem function and process, often exacerbated by feedbacks at global and local scales (eg Scheffer et al. 2006). Physical and biological interdependencies are, we would suggest, better known and understood than those in the social realm. Nevertheless, there is growing concern that \u201cflips\u201d in the ecological system of particular places may scale up to have broader implications, not only for the regional biophysical environment, but also for the long\u2010term viability of human activities in distant places.",

The integration of global markets becomes the structure for teleconnected vulnerabilities at different levels and spatial scales, and thus also introduces new instabilities into social change. The evolving structure of global commodity chains and the movement toward greater global market integration has exacerbated the disparity between rich and poor, both within and between countries. This growing inequality and persistent poverty has profound consequences for natural resource use, conservation, and the prospects for sustainable development. It is increasingly argued that divergence in development paths among world regions has negative consequences for economic growth, human security, and environmental welfare at global scales (Sachs 2005). While it is widely recognized that commodity and financial markets serve as a structure for transferring risks and that these risks often fall on poorer regions, we argue here that the nested relationships of vulnerability mean that levels of sensitivity and capacities to cope with shock are influenced by feedbacks between local and global parts of systems.",

Nevertheless, the structure of local economic relations are increasingly nested within the broader structure of consolidated global markets, thus tying the incomes of economically marginal populations not only to local economic shocks but also to the vagaries and price fluctuations of global capital markets. Ultimately, these interdependencies increase the sensitivity of poor populations to other stresses and reduce their capacity to address these risks, thus making them more vulnerable (eg O'Brien and Leichenko 2000).",

Population movements to agricultural frontiers in Amazonia, Africa, and Asia have had negative implications for forests, biodiversity, and soils and, over the long term, have increased the sensitivity of frontier populations to environmental shocks, such as fire and drought. Rapid urbanization throughout the developing world over the past several decades has increased the capacity of individuals to manage and avoid environmental risks associated with fire, pollution, earthquakes, and other hazards. Yet the same processes simultaneously decrease the collective capacity of urban social\u2013ecological systems to manage shocks and disturbance. In southern Africa, for example, migrants become vectors of HIV/AIDS, creating geographic corridors of increased sensitivity to other stressors, such as drought, and decreased capacity to manage such shocks (Leichenko and O'Brien 2008). Informal settlements of migrant populations are often the most susceptible to impacts from hurricanes, landslides, and earthquakes (Mitchell 1999).",

Energy policy in the US has also caused a dramatic expansion of land planted with corn, as well as a redistribution of grain allocated between export and domestic consumption, with consequences for sensitivity to food security in neighboring Mexico. The consequences of the movement of materials around the world are also increasingly apparent in bio\u2010invasive species (Perrings et al. 2005), demand for land that leads to habitat conversion, over\u2010exploitation of species, and even the emergence of new diseases, as discussed in the next section.",

In this way, SARS illustrates the mechanisms that communicate human exposure to disease, as well as the nested nature of global environmental change. The economic changes associated with increasing incomes and changing consumption patterns combine with land\u2010use and environmental change to create the conditions that make populations vulnerable to emerging diseases. In the case of SARS, and for many other emerging infectious diseases, globalization of travel and economic linkages spread the vulnerability of susceptible populations across the globe. Jones et al.

These fluctuations have implications for incomes in producing nations and even for inflation in both importing and exporting countries (Thanh Ha and Shively 2008). For coffee, the income and welfare of farmers are dependent on the highly volatile international market. This volatility, in turn, is heavily influenced by climatic events affecting the world's largest coffee producers \u2013 Brazil, and now Vietnam. These global economic teleconnections affect the viability of coffee livelihoods in particular places, and are, in turn, exacerbated or mitigated by local climate impacts, institutional change, and domestic policy reform.

The aggregate price of exported coffee over the past decades is illustrated in Figure 3. In 1989, the International Coffee Agreement, which up until then regulated the world supply of coffee, collapsed, precipitating a dramatic decline in world prices. The 1990s were also a period of rapid domestic economic change for many coffee\u2010producing countries, including Vietnam and Mexico. The transformation of the Vietnamese economy from a socialist command economy to an economy based on market principles, coupled with land reforms and changes to the land registration system, gave new opportunities for diversification in livelihoods and mobility to rural households. From 1990 to 2000, as rural households transformed forest into coffee plantations, coffee production increased tenfold in Vietnam; it is now one of the world's largest producers of coffee beans.

Dak Lak is one of the major coffee producing provinces in the Central Highlands, where 95% of agricultural output is coffee. However, as a result of rapid land conversion, the province is affected by declining environmental health in the form of forest loss, soil erosion, loss of biodiversity, and the implications of these for food security, exacerbating widespread economic insecurity for the majority of farmers (DiGregorio et al. 2003).

While the aggressive expansion of coffee in Vietnam is generating erosion and deforestation, the abandonment of coffee in Mexico may, in the short term, lead to forest regeneration or, in the long term, to the expansion of less ecologically desirable land uses, such as sugarcane and pasture (Hausermann and Eakin 2008).",

The increasingly consolidated structure of global markets creates circumstances of nested vulnerability, in which shocks at the global scale cascade down to affect local livelihoods and welfare. However, our examples also illustrate the reverse process: as ongoing development pressures and environmental stress move social\u2013ecological systems nearer to thresholds of critical change, the response of even small communities to economic shocks or to new opportunities may trigger vulnerabilities elsewhere.",

Thus, it is possible, and indeed necessary, to compare vulnerabilities in different parts of the world, in terms of common drivers and outcomes. Wildlife traders and hunters in China and Vietnam, in securing their own livelihoods, may be creating vulnerabilities to disease elsewhere in the region. Economic incentives for coffee expansion in Vietnam lead to deforestation, thereby increasing vulnerability to environmental degradation locally, while contributing to livelihood insecurity in rural Mexico.",

It is increasingly clear that while local vulnerability assessments are essential, understanding interrelated vulnerabilities in different localities will be an important task of future research. The role of population mobility in both increasing exposure to and altering the capacity of economies to diversify forms of risk is poorly understood. Traditional nomadic populations have always employed strategies that spread risks geographically, and such strategies are common in rural\u2013urban cyclical migration (Adger et al. 2002; Thornton et al. 2007). But changing risks of drought or storm impact associated with climate change, for example, have much greater spatial extent, so that traditional strategies may no longer be effective. Similarly, technological change is driving specific ecological vulnerabilities. Berkes et al. (2006) demonstrate that the globalization of fisheries has decreased the resilience of marine ecosystems: exploitation of sea urchins and herbivorous reef fish species in the past three decades, in particular, makes reefs more vulnerable to recurrent disturbances such as hurricanes, and to coral bleaching and mortality due to increased sea surface temperatures.",
