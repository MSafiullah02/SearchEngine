Considerable progress has been made over the past decade in the ventilatory management of patients with ARDS. In particular, a strict limitation of tidal volume (VT) and plateau pressure (Pplat) below 30 cmH2O reduces mortality [3]. The application of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) is recognized to recruit the lung and to restore functional residual capacity [4], but its optimum level is still widely debated [5].",

            "text": "The prone position (PP) may also be part of the ventilatory strategy. This method was proposed more than 30 years ago, initially in pathophysiological studies [6,7]. Recently, Sud et al. [8] suggested, on the basis of pooled data from randomized, controlled trials, that PP may improve survival in the subgroup of patients with the most severe ARDS, that is, those with a ratio of partial pressure of arterial O2 to fraction of inspired O2 (PaO2/FiO2) < 100 mmHg. Many questions remain unresolved. In particular, response to PP is usually defined according to changes in PaO2, with responders being those in whom the PaO2/FiO2 ratio increases > 20 mmHg after one to six hours in the PP [9-11]. However, we have previously reported that PP allows recruitment of a slow compartment previously excluded from ventilation [12]. This was associated with a decrease in partial pressure of arterial CO2 (PaCO2), an indirect reflection of the reduction of the alveolar dead space (VDalv) [12]. Gattinoni et al. [10] also reported that the prognosis is improved in patients in whom PaCO2 declines after an initial PP session. Finally, VDalv appears to be an independent risk factor for mortality in patients with ARDS [13]. In a recent study, Siddiki et al. [14] proposed evaluating the physiological dead space fraction (VDphysiol/VT) by using a rearranged alveolar gas equation for PaCO2 without any expired CO2 measurement.",

            "text": "One of the objectives of our study was to describe alterations in VDalv induced by PP. ARDS is characterized by a heterogeneous lung with the existence of a slow compartment [18,20], defined as areas available for, but partially or totally excluded from, ventilation due in part to a bronchiolar collapse [12,21]. In a previous study, we reported that PP may induce recruitment of this slow compartment, as suggested by its ability to counteract intrinsic PEEP and to decrease the expiratory time constant [12]. In the same study, we also reported that PP leads to a decrease in PaCO2, suggesting diminution of VDalv (alveolar dead space) [12]. Our present study demonstrates that PP may induce a decrease in VDalv. It occurred from the third hour and was maintained throughout the PP session. VDalv may be the consequence of nonperfused or poorly perfused lung areas in ventilated anterior areas, but also of a slow compartment partially excluded from ventilation. Our results suggest that PP induces functional lung recruitment, especially since decreases in VDalv related to PP were associated with a decrease in Pplat and strongly correlated with improvement in compliance. Interestingly, in a previous study of 16 ARDS patients, Pelosi et al. [22] did not find a decrease in VDphysiol after 120 minutes in PP. One of the explanations for this discrepancy could be the different levels of PEEP in the two studies: 12.3 cmH2O in Pelosi et al.'s study and only 6 cmH2O in our study. However, Protti et al. [23], in a study of patients ventilated with a PEEP of 13 cmH2O, demonstrated a strong relation between lung recruitability and decreased PaCO2 related to PP. Pelosi et al. also did not report a decrease in Pplat in PP, as we found, but after returning patients to the supine position [22]. This could be explained by the fact that they used roll under the upper part of the chest wall, leading to a significant impairment in chest wall compliance [22], whereas we did not.",

            "text": "The most beneficial reported effect of PP is oxygenation improvement [24,25]. However, this better oxygenation can be due to (1) lung recruitment related to restoration of functional residual capacity [7] and improvement of the diaphragmatic movement in the posterior part [26-28] or (2) simply to an improvement in the ventilation/perfusion ratio due to a decreased hydrostatic gradient between the anterior and posterior parts of the lung [26,29]. Whereas the first mechanism is crucial, one can say that the second mechanism is less important. This is why the second objective of our study was to test whether the response to PP in terms of PaCO2 was physiologically more relevant than in terms of PaO2/FiO2 ratio. Gattinoni et al. [10] reported that an increase in PaO2/FiO2 ratio > 20 mmHg after six hours of PP is not predictive of the patient's prognosis, whereas a decline in PaCO2 \u22651 mmHg is. In our present study, 7 of 13 patients were PaO2 responders (increased PaO2/FiO2 ratio > 20 mmHg after 15 hours of PP). However, changes in Pplat, PaCO2 and VDalv did not differ between PaO2 responders and PaO2 nonresponders. On the other hand, 7 of 13 patients were PaCO2 responders (decreased PaCO2 > 2 mmHg after 15 hours of PP). PaCO2 responders had a significant decrease in Pplat and VDalv, as well as a significant increase in oxygenation and compliance, compared with nonresponders. Our results are in accordance with a recent study of 32 ARDS patients [23], in which the investigators reported that PaCO2 variation induced by PP, and not PaO2/FiO2 variation, is associated with lung recruitability. Interestingly, in our study, changes in VDalv were not correlated with changes in oxygenation but were strongly correlated with changes in compliance of the respiratory system.",

[30], which concluded that PP may reduce mortality in patients with severe ARDS, PP sessions lasted 20 hours/day. In a recent study, we demonstrated that PP sessions that lasted 18 hours/day were independently associated with survival [31]. In the present study, the maximum effect of PP for VDalv, PaCO2 and Pplat occurred six to nine hours after turning patients to PP. Later the effect seemed to be a decline. How this affects the effect of PP on patient prognosis remains to be elucidated.",
