However, the impact of adherence or lack of, with the guidelines of infection control was almost never reported in these studies. This is because it is very difficult to reliably measure and/or observe infection control practises amongst HCPs on a continuous basis. Yet, failure to account for infection control practises threatens the validity of our understanding of HAIs. Although a number of studies (Camins and Fraser, 2005, Won et al., 2004) examined the association between the implementation of hand hygiene promotion programmes and HAIs, infection control guidelines are far more encompassing than hand hygiene. To date, there is little evidence concerning the impact of strict enforcement of infection control guidelines on the rate of HAIs.",

The strict enforcement of, and adherence to the infection control guidelines at Canadian hospitals during the SARS outbreak presents a rare opportunity to examine the impact of such enforcement on the risk of HAIs amongst ICU patients. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to retrospectively compare the risk of developing HAIs in the ICU before and during the SARS outbreak. The intent of such comparison is to provide a surrogate measure of the influence that strict enforcement of infection control guidelines might have had on the risk of developing HAIs.",

Infection control practises/strategies during these two periods are outlined in Appendix A. This sample of 400 charts was deemed sufficient to detect an absolute risk reduction of 10% in the risk of developing HAIs during the SARS period, using an alpha of 0.05 and assuming 80% power. The inclusion criteria for the study required that patients be free from pre-existing HAIs upon ICU admission and that they had an ICU length of stay of 48 hours or greater. A patient was considered a positive HAI case if he/she had a confirmed diagnosis of infection (types are outlined in Table 1\n) that did not exist at the time of ICU admission. Diagnoses of HAI's at the time of admission of our sample were made according to the CDC criteria for the definition of HAIs as outlined in Garner et al. (1988). For the purpose of statistical adjustment for potential confounding relationships, data were also collected on other commonly reported risk factors of HAI (Table 2\n).",

Basic descriptive statistics such as general frequencies of nominal variables, and means and standard errors of continuous variables were performed on the total sample and between the two groups (i.e., HAI versus no HAI). Chi square comparisons were performed to compare HAIs between the pre-SARS and SARS periods. Chi-square and t-test comparisons were also performed to compare the demographic and prognostic factors between those who had HAIs and those who did not. Then, multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to identify the independent (i.e. adjusted) association between the period (pre-SARS versus SARS) and the risk of developing HAI, whilst adjusting for other demographic and prognostic variables. Variables were included in the regression model based on a liberal criterion (i.e., p\n \u2264 0.25) concerning the association that each of these variables had with HAIs in the univariate analysis (Hosmer and Lemshow, 2000). This liberal p value was chosen to avoid unnecessary deletion of potentially significant independent predictors from the regression model. A 95% confidence interval (95\nCI) that did not include 1.0 was set as the criterion to establish significance.",

The total number of HAIs was 47 (11.8%), which were distributed across a number of specific infections as outlined in Table 1.

Instead, it used the experience of policy enforcement that took place during the SARS outbreak as a surrogate measure of adherence with proper infection control practises. In addition, patients in the two time periods may have had different baseline characteristics and/or different exposure times. Further, our infection rates were reported based on an older version of the CDC criteria for the definition of healthcare associated infections, which however were not significantly changed in the 2008 updated criteria (Horan et al., 2008). Despite these limitations, the findings of this study carry a clinical significance with regard to the influence that strict enforcement of hand hygiene guidelines may have on the risk of developing HAIs. Finally, it is important to mention that other extreme measures such as the cancellation of all casual visitations, outpatient services and elective surgeries took place during the SARS outbreak period. Such measures may have been a contributing factor to our results. Therefore, we recommend that these results be interpreted with caution within the context of this research.",
