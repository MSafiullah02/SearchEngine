Alveolar air, under normal conditions, is at a temperature of 37 \u00b0C and alveolar gas is fully saturated with water vapor at this temperature, properly humidified and heated by the components of the upper respiratory tract walls [8]. The role of these walls is not only to allow gaseous exchange, but it provides a large contact surface with the outside, it must also ensure adequate protection, in particular from dehydration and cooling. Inhalation of cold air induces activation of the epithelium to generate proinflammatory substances and that epithelial injury, determines activation of any exposed peripheral nerves. Vasomotor control in the airways is mediated by parasympathetic and sympathetic nerves, that through the release of neuropeptides such as Substance P and Calcitonin Gene Related Peptide (CGRP) [9], which can induce powerful vasodilation. Substances used for inhalation tests such as histamine, methacholine or substances locally released such as prostaglandins, produced locally by cells such as mast cells or eosinophils act on bronchial blood flow. Vasodilatation of bronchial vessels has been shown to cause thickening of the airway mucosa and should antagonize the effects of hyperventilation, but also helps to stimulate bronchial hyperresponsiveness that can trigger asthma attacks in predisposed subjects.",

Winter athletes can be particularly affected by these environmental conditions, and an increased prevalence of airway hyperresponsiveness, asthma and chronic cough has been described in this population [14\u201318]. Bronchial biopsies of winter athletes have shown evidence of airway remodelling, possibly due to repeated cold-air and hyperventilation damage to the airways, although more research is needed on this influence on airway function [19, 20]. The mechanism of bronchoconstriction as a response to exercise-induced hyperpnoea, particularly in cold air, has been studied and appears primarily related to an increase in airway fluid osmolarity following hyperpnoea, although heat loss may be a modulator of this response, as well as a possible post-exercise \u201crewarming\u201d of the airways [21].",

Since extremes of cold and particulate pollution may coexist, for example during temperature inversion during winter, these results may have important public health implications. Cold is related to various acute or long term airways diseases. General exposure to cold exacerbates chronic bronchitis and triggers Raynaud\u2019s phenomenon of the lung (constriction of the pulmonary arteries and reduction of pulmonary blood volume in subjects with primary Raynaud phenomenon). Moreover, breathing very cold air at very high ventilation levels can led to acute pulmonary oedema or to frozen lungs [8]. It was also shown that inhalation of cold air causes vasodilation and thus increasing blood flow to the central airways in contrast to vasoconstriction in the intraparenchymal area [29]. In subjects who repeatedly hyperventilate very cold air, repeated episodes of significant variations in bronchial blood flow can lead to alterations in walls of bronchi and of pulmonary arteries, leading to faster than average decrease of lung function and increased thickness of walls of pulmonary arteries (Eskimo lung) [29]. According to a more recent classification, it is possible to classify cold- related diseases of the airways into three types: the short term responses are those that develop within minutes in response to sudden cooling of the airways, subjects with asthma or rhinitis are especially prone to these response; the long-term responses are those that develop in response to repeated and longstanding cooling and drying of the airway, usually in endurance athletes; finally, there are the physiological, reflex-mediated lower airway responses to cooling of the skin or upper airways [2].",

The only exposure to cold stimuli, can defect, turn on the cold-mediated activation of the TRPM8 channel and determine mucus hypersecretion with excessive MUC5AC secretion, and obstacle mucociliary clearance through numerical and structural anomalies of the ciliary apparatus. The inhalation of cold air, however, can only activate the TRPM8 receptor, but cannot determine the baseline overexpression of this receptor in patients with COPD. Probably cigarette smoke, that is also the main risk factor for COPD, is the etiological factor for the elevated expression of the TRPM8 channel in these patients, and so they are predisposed and hypersensitive to cold stimulus, even as air conditioning [30]. The synergistic effect between smoking and exposure to cold air was also observed in other studies, evaluating changes in impedance in the respiratory tract after exposure to cold in young smokers and nonsmokers: a broncho-constricting effect extending largely into the small peripheral airways can be demonstrated by impedance measurement in a group of asymptomatic young smokers which is not observed in normal subjects after cold-air challenge [31, 32].",

However, as the nose is serving as outermost filter for the inspired air, it is exposed to environmental hazards with consequent high frequency of morbidity. Adding to the atopic predisposition, it is likely that asthmatic subjects have concomitant rhinitis, which does not allow proper conditioning of the inspired air with negative impact on the asthmatic condition. The cross-talk and interplay between upper and lower airways has been a center point in the philosophy of the Allergic Rhinitis and its Impact on Asthma (ARIA) initiative and has been reconfirmed over the years [35, 36].",

Microclimate can affect heat exchanges between individuals and the environment and in some situations hinder the thermoregulation mechanisms. For example, high humidity values in the summer can increase the heat-related discomfort: the high presence of water vapor in the air hampers the evaporation of the water contained in the sweat, which is the fundamental process for the human body to disperse excess heat. This explains why, in the presence of sultriness, a climatic situation characterized by a high relative humidity value, the human body tolerates less heat discomfort and the perceived temperature than the actual ambient temperature. The reason why the wind can increase the discomfort associated with a cold feeling is related to the fact that it increases the rate at which the body loses heat. The so-called perceived temperature, that is, the feeling of \u201chot\u201d or \u201ccold\u201d, is therefore tied not only to the actual temperature but also to the other environmental conditions [1].",

            "text": "Regarding the pathologies more specifically associated with the use of conditioning systems, they may be related to the failure to achieve microclimatic targets or because they can be dangerous sources of biological or chemical pollution, especially if they are badly designed, in poor state of cleaning and maintenance [39]. Nasal breathing of cold air induces an engorgement of the venous sinuses in the submucosa [5, 10], which leads to congestion, sneezing and, especially, rhinorrhea both in healthy and rhinitic subjects [13]. However, these responses are greater in subjects with rhinitis than in healthy subjects [40] and greater in subjects with asthma and rhinitis than in subjects with rhinitis alone [41]. Yet in a short time, cold air hyperpnea provokes bronchoconstriction in asthmatic subjects [42], especially in children and young adults [43, 44]. The pathophysiological mechanism beyond this response has been a matter of considerable debate: studies on the effect of cooling on the airways smooth muscle have been conflicting results [45\u201348]. Certain lower airway sensory receptors can be sensitive to cold and capable of inducing bronchoconstriction in animals [49, 50]. A fundamental role is certainly played by vasoconstriction, as already described before. It does not seem to be involved in a response mediated by eosinophils [51]. Besides bronchoconstriction, cold air hyperventilation also provokes coughing in susceptible people. Coughing and bronchoconstriction seem to be independent responses since pre-treatment with salbutamol blocks cold air-provoked bronchoconstriction but has no effect on cold air provoked coughing [52].",

Indoor air can be an important vehicle for a variety of human pathogens airborne spread, already in normal conditions, as vegetative bacteria (staphylococci and legionellae), fungi (Aspergillus, Penicillium, and Cladosporium spp and Stachybotryschartarum), enteric viruses (noro- and rotaviruses), respiratory viruses (influenza and coronaviruses), mycobacteria (tuberculous and nontuberculous), and bacterial spore formers (Clostridium difficile and Bacillus anthracis) which can have pathogenic action on human health, together with exposure to other agents as noxious chemicals, particulates, pollen and other allergens [61]. Because these agents can infect a susceptible host, they must survive the prevailing environmental conditions, determined by air temperature, relative humidity (RH), turbulence, that are just a few of the factors involved, since a generalization is difficult considering the biological diversity of microorganisms. So it is obvious the role played by air conditioning, cold or warm. Various studies have shown that among the viruses, for example, rotavirus survived best at midrange RH but not at high temperature; among bacteria, staphylococci has ability to survive over a wide range of temperatures, RH, and exposure to sunlight [61].",

Fungal infections can be particularly serious in immunocompromised patients, especially airborne spores of Aspergillus spp that are blown in from natural ventilation sources. Fungal spores are aerosolized from municipal water supplies and dust and can be effectively transported over long distances by wind and air currents. The evolution of the fungal spore has enabled them to travel long distances and be more capable of withstanding environmental insults. The most important factor for fungal growth in indoor environments is humidity. In fact, results of many studies, showed that airborne fungal concentrations were not correlated to the diseases or personnel density, but were related to seasons, temperature, and relative humidity. There were similar dominant genera in all wards. They were Aspergillus spp Penicillium spp and Alternaria spp. Therefore, attention should be paid to improve the filtration efficiency of particle size of 1.1-4.7 \u03bcm for air conditioning system of wards. It also should be targeted to choose appropriate antibacterial methods and equipment for daily hygiene and air conditioning system operation management [62]. In fact, the risk of air conditioning-caused infections is increased when, to save on air cooling costs, especially with regard to the air conditioning of rooms with large volumes of air to cool (department stores, ships, airplanes, etc.), instead of cooling hot air coming from the outside, it is preferable to keep the air cooled previously cooled from the inside (recirculation function) cool. This, however, significantly reduces air exchange in the environments while increasing the concentration of pollutants (irritants, fumes, allergenic pollens, etc.) and infectious agents (viruses and bacteria) that can add to their pathogenic activity already in itself represented by the particular physical characteristics of an artificially cold and dry air. Much work is directed at the need to use air filters for the control of respiratory diseases, especially of an allergic type, by applying filtering systems that regulate the level of pollution [63].\n",
