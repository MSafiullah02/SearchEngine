Traditionally, rapid detection of RNA viruses has relied on nucleic acid-based techniques like polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using specific primers or probes, and/or serology-based techniques like enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (Aziz et al., 2017). In recent years, the development of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies has innovated methods for RNA virus detection (Capobianchi et al., 2013, Shan et al., 2011, Yu et al., 2013, Zhang et al., 2014). NGS can reveal a huge number sequences of nucleic acids (DNA or RNA) within specimens through some random modes, and can detect various kinds of RNA viruses simultaneously thereby. Virome detection has been widely applied to identification of novel RNA viruses and research of RNA viruses (Masson et al., 2014, Paez-Espino et al., 2016, Webster et al., 2015).",

Each library was sequenced separately on an Ion 318\u2122 Chip (Life Technologies, USA). Obtained short reads were deposited in the Sequence Read Archives of NCBI (accession numbers: SRR5078294, SRR5078297, SRR5078298, SRR5078299, SRR5078300, SRR5078301, SRR5078288, SRR4051861 and SRR4051862). The primers SPN8 and SP were trimmed from the reads before assembly for method 3. The reads were assembled using the CLC genomics workbench 8.5.1 (Qiagen, Germany). Assembled contigs shorter than 100 bp were removed, and the remaining contigs were compared to the non-redundant nucleotide databases using the standalone NCBI BLASTn tool (McGinnis and Madden, 2004). The E-value of 10\u22123 was used as the cutoff value for significant hits. The BLASTn results were parsed using the MetaGenome Analyzer (MEGAN vesion 5.10.5) with the default LCA parameters(Huson et al., 2007), and the taxonomic assignment was based on the first hit. Sequences placed in the roots in Megan diagrams were taken into account. All the contig hits of viruses excluding phages were verified manually through online BLAST at NCBI web station. The sequencing depth (corresponding to the number of hits obtained for a given nucleotide position) and coverage (corresponding to the percentage of the nucleotides in the genomic sequences which have been sequenced) of the three known viruses in sample 1 were analyzed as compared with the genomic sequences of the AIV strain A/chicken/Shaanxi/xa0414/2013 (H9N2) (GenBank accession numbers: KM609865, KM609825, KM609785, KM609585, KM609705, KM609665, KM609625 and KM609745), the NDV strain Du/CH/LGX/280/2013 (GenBank accession number: KM885162), and the IBV strain ck/CH/LHB/130578 (GenBank accession number: KP118890). The reads of sample 1 were mapped to the reference sequences using the software tool BLAT (v 34) (Kent, 2002). The total length of the contigs (the sum of the lengths of all the contigs) plus the sequencing coverage and depth were evaluated using the software tool soap.coverage (2.7.7) (Li et al., 2008).",

Theoretically, methods 2 and 3 can be started from viral RNA of a concentration below RNA quantification limits, while method 1 should be started from viral RNA above the RNA quantification limits. Since most clinical samples collected from a single person or animal contains viral RNA below the RNA quantification limit, method 1 is not suitable for most clinical samples, although it may be suitable for other applications, e.g., transcriptome detection.
