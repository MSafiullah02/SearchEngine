            "text": "The global COVID-19 pandemic has swept through the nations of the world with a frightening speed, and left governments struggling to cope with the situation. The initial responses have been directed towards limiting the death toll and ensuring that health services are not completely overwhelmed, as would be only too possible with an infection that can grow by a factor of one thousand in a month. As there is as yet no vaccine, no effective medication, and very imperfect understanding of the parameters of the epidemic, efforts have been directed towards containment, with decisions about return to normality being left until later. Without vaccine or effective medical treatment, the only remaining strategies would appear to be either a policy of contact tracing and quarantining, or developing herd immunity. The first of these policies appears to have been applied successfully in South Korea and Singapore, and is generally regarded as the first line of public health defence. In the current pandemic, most countries have quickly found themselves overwhelmed by the scale and speed of the outbreak, and have been unable to apply contact tracing as rigorously and universally as is needed for the method to work. When it does work, contact tracing and quarantine will allow an outbreak to be snuffed out before it spreads widely, but it will of course leave a large population of susceptibles open to a new infection, so continuing vigilance is essential. As we have seen contact tracing overwhelmed, the goal of this paper is to explore the route to herd immunity, using age-dependent release from lockdown, and a gradual relaxation of social distancing rules. In Section 2 we present the model, which is in almost all respects a straightforward variant of the standard SIR epidemic model. The equations contain terms for the controls which are available to modify the dynamics of the epidemic. The problem is a control problem, and for this we have to define the objective, which we do in Section 3. The issue is of course that we have a conflict between the obvious cost of the numbers of citizens whose lives are ended prematurely, which is a concern for the next few months; and the damage that an extended lockdown will do to the economy, which will be a concern for many years if the aftermath of the 2008 financial crash is any guide. In setting up the cost structure, some relatively arbitrary (but hopefully reasonably realistic) assumptions have to be made; these are not in any way essential to the approach, and can easily be changed by any reader prepared to play with the Jupyter notebook posted online 1 . Parameter values, or even the entire form of the costs, can be changed by anyone with a little knowledge of Python. Experts in health economics would doubtless be able to suggest values that better embody current thinking, and before any of the results of this paper can be relied on, such inputs will be necessary.",

This assumption does not fit well with observation, so we can allow for different distributions by the familiar trick of the method of stages (see, for example, [2] ), in which a infected individual passes through a number of exponentially-distributed stages. In more detail, we can suppose that there are K x stages for the symptomatic infection, and that I k j (t) is the number of symptomatic j-individuals at stage k of the infection at time t, j = 1, . . . , J, k = 1, . . . , K x .

We could similarly decompose the asymptomatic infections, and indeed by further ramifications of the method of stages we could make the distribution of infected time approximate any desired distribution. There is a good reason not to take this too far, however; in the numerics, the differential equation has to be solved many times. It is remarkable that this can be done in a reasonable amount of time, but the more complicated the model, the slower this step becomes and ultimately the computation will be too slow.

So the code has a parameter deathfactor which is used to scale SC1 for the calculations. This is only part of the story however. We need to calculate the number of deaths which will result from any particular policy, and this comes from the calculated stream of removed symptomatic infectives, coming at rate \u03c1I j (t) in age group j. Most of these will have recovered, but a percentage of these will need hospitalization, and of those a percentage will need critical care. The probabilities depend on the age of the patient, with older patients at much higher risk; estimates are given in [8] and are quoted in [3] . So we calculate the rate at which new critical care beds are required. Based on an estimate for the number of days a critical care patient needs a bed (taken to be 20 days), and knowing the total number of available critical care beds, we can keep a running count of the number of critical care beds in use, and then see how many of the incoming patients for critical care can be accommodated.

The probabilities of hospitalization and critical care need for these age groups are estimated by Verity et al. [8] . The population numbers for these age groups come from the Statista web site (https://www.statista.com/topics/755/uk/). The number of critical care beds in England at the end of 2019 was around 4100, with around 11000 more planned at the emergency Nightingale hospitals, so as an optimistic figure we took 12500 to be the number. The mean infectious period was taken to be 7 days, in line with values in [3] , but it seems this can be highly variable. Various values were tried for p, the probability of an infected person being symptomatic, but the baseline for this parameter was 0.3. Infectivity was taken to be 2.4, in line with values proposed by [3] , but again there appears to be quite a wide range of possible values, as we see from [4] . The contact matrix values m O , m H are derived from [5] ; they work with different age ranges, so some pre-processing of their data had to be done; the code for this is available from the author on request.",

The only routine which managed acceptable runtimes was SLSQP, but it turned out that for virtually all randomly-chosen starting points, the end point was the same as the start point; so this suggested the method which is used in the Jupyter notebook, which is simply to randomly generate control rules of the form discussed above, and focus on those which do best.",

The load of new cases is much more manageable, with a peak of just over 2,200 new critical care cases, and about 16,000 new cases in all. All but the two oldest age groups are out of lockdown within 100 days, but looking at Figure 4 we see that even after 800 days the epidemic is far from over; once the oldest group is let out of lockdown and social distancing has come to an end, the epidemic starts to take off again.",

This supports the proposition that some form of social distancing will have to be maintained for a very long time if no treatment or vaccine can be found. Next we see what happens if in fact the infectivity is higher than the middle case value of 2.4 suggested in [3] . This time, lockdown and social distancing costs remain at around 146bn, death costs are about 8.5bn, and the total number of deaths is 38,700. The general picture looks like the previous situation but more accentuated; there is a clear second surge after the oldest age group is released from lockdown, and some 25,000 die without the critical care they need as the hospitals are submerged with cases. This time, saturation of the critical care facilities begins around day 600 and keeps going. Even maintaining social distancing at 90% is not sufficient to hold back the epidemic in the longer run. If the probability that an infective is symptomatic is reduced to 0.2, the outcome is improved, with death costs around 4.2bn, lockdown costs little changed, and total deaths reduced to 17,500. Figure  7 shows two pronounced peaks to the infection, the second again coinciding with the final relaxation of restrictions. The critical care capacity only saturates at around day 650 this time. The epidemic is on a smaller and more manageable scale; peak admissions to critical care are just over 600, peak hospital admissions just over 4000. This is not surprising, since the proportion of those infected who are symptomatic (and therefore open to possible complications) is lower. However, there are more undetected asymptomatic infecteds going about in the population, so the number of deaths is higher than in the base case; it is clear from the pictures that towards the end the epidemic is beginning to get out of control. In this scenario, we find the costs of lockdown and social distancing to be reduced to 124bn, death costs around 5.7bn. The number of deaths is 22,700. What is most clear from Figure 10 is that from the time that the 70-79 age group is released from lockdown around day 200, the epidemic gradually gets more out of control, with critical care at full stretch from day 450 onwards, and the numbers of older patients needing critical care and dying without it growing 10,000 at the end of the run. Of course, it is only possible to display a few examples, which barely begins to explore the diversity of behaviour that will arise as parameters are varied.

The treatment of the spread of the infection in the home is an approximation, plausibly based perhaps, but still an approximation. Nevertheless, the modelling assumptions are simple and compact, and permit rapid exploration of possible responses of a non-pharmaceutical nature. The calculations require assumptions about the initial state of the epidemic which are essentially guessed. Even coming into the epidemic once it is under way, it would be hard to get reliable values for the numbers of asymptomatic, susceptible and immune people in the population, not least because there is at the time of writing no test to determine whether someone has had the infection and is now immune, and only a rather unreliable test whether an individual currently has the infection. No account is taken of parameter uncertainty. This is a natural area of enquiry, but at the moment it seems that the data that would support strong conclusions is not yet available. As it seems that the key parameters are known with very little precision, a highly detailed model, or a sophisticated story about statistical inference may help less than some rough exploration of possible parameter combinations; as the epidemic evolves around the world, we will undoubtedly learn more of its characteristics, which will allow us better to control it.",
