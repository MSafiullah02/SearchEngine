Of particular concern is the fact that these stocks have\nnever been subjected to testing for adventitious agents, whereas a new vaccine intended\nto supplement the existing stockpile has been thoroughly tested (1). Testing of these old stocks met the standards of the day.\nHowever, if these old vaccines are to be considered valid parts of our national\nstockpile we should expect not only continuing testing of potency and sterility but also\ntesting for adventitious agents with methods that reflect the standards of today.",

Equally important is the fact that for many decades preceding the\ndevelopment of standardized manufacturing methods in the 20th century, the vaccine virus\n(vaccinia virus) was propagated by serial passages in animals without precise knowledge\nof the passage history and without use of a seed lot system that stabilized passage\nlevel. This uncontrolled system could have allowed amplification of any passenger\nviruses and could have increased the possibility of untoward changes in their genetic\nmakeup. In addition, since the crude manufacturing methods (Figure) allowed direct contact of the materials harvested from\nanimals with human operators, possibilities existed for contamination of the resulting\nproduct with pathogenic human viruses. It was not uncommon practice before the\nwidespread acceptance of vaccine manufacture in animals (at the end of the 19th century)\nto passage vaccinia virus arm-to-arm between humans (2). Standardized methods for manufacture in animal skin were not initiated\nuntil 1925.",

Specific tests for adventitious infectious agents\nare conducted using various polymerase chain reaction (PCR)\u2013 and\nimmunochemical\u2013based assays. The extraordinary sensitivity of these assays has\nserved to raise the bar of expectation of test veracity, while improving practicality\nand containing costs. In many cases, these assays have been validated, that is,\nproof-tested using salted vaccine and vaccine substrate materials. Since companies exist\nthat conduct these specific tests for vaccine developers and manufacturers, such testing\non old smallpox vaccine stocks is eminently feasible. The new cell culture-based\nsmallpox vaccine has been tested by using these methods (1). However, considering more advanced PCR-based tests for unknown or\nunrecognized adventitious agents (e.g., representational difference analysis, use of\nvarious degenerate primers) would require extensive research and add substantially to\noverall costs.

Therefore, newer, more\nspecific tests are planned for the future. Second, testing for viral adventitious agents\nof animal skin vaccine should take into consideration the source country of the animals.\nGuidelines for transmissible spongiform encephalopathy testing should be followed.\nThird, the concentration of nonpathogenic bacteria and fungi in vaccines produced in\nanimal skin may be very difficult to validate, and consistent sterility of the finished\nproduct may be difficult to achieve. The use of a nonsterile final product may be\njustified since smallpox vaccine is administered by scarification rather than by\nintramuscular or intravenous inoculation, and because its use over many years did not\ncause problems. Fourth, the general method for testing a live viral vaccine strain for\ncontaminating viruses is to neutralize the vaccine virus and test for adventitious\nviruses both in vitro and in vivo. However, it is recognized that vaccinia virus is very\ndifficult to neutralize to the extent required for such studies. Additional testing such\nas nucleic acid amplification techniques for specified viruses and reverse transcriptase\nassays for retroviruses should complement nonspecific tests. Fifth, in preparing master\nseed lots, procedures should be used that help remove extraneous agents. Since removal\nor inactivation of microbial contaminants is unlikely at any downstream level, the\npresence of extraneous agents in seed lots during the production process must be\navoided. Sixth, the absence of specific human pathogens should be confirmed by\nadditional testing, e.g., bacterial and fungal cultures, virus culture, PCR testing for\nviral agents.",
