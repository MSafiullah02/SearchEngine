Mock-infected cells maintained a flattered morphology with adherence to plastic. By contrast, GDVII virus infection induced CPE within 18\u201324 h in astrocyte monolayers. Although the percentage of infected cells is almost 100% in both primary and secondary cultures, as determined by the infectious center assay, the foci were more evident in secondary trypsinized cultures reaching 70\u201380% confluence than in primary, contact-inhibited cultures (not shown). Analysis of virus production by titration of infected astrocyte supernatants on BHK-21 cells demonstrated maximal titers of 5\u201330 \u00d7 105 PFU/ml in BeAn-infected astrocytes equivalent to the production of 0.2\u20131.2 PFU/cell. Titers two orders of magnitude higher (107), or 7\u201333 PFU/cell, were found in GDVII-infected cells (Fig. 1). Nonspecific binding of virus to the plastic of culture flasks without cells was not detected and the presence of residual virus remaining from the inoculum was ruled out (Fig. 1, circles). Despite the low PFU output from BeAn-infected cells supernatants, our previous analysis by flow cytometry documented BeAn virus replication in the cytoplasm of astrocytes (Rubio and Martin-Clemente, 1999), and another recent study reported that BeAn virus is localized within the astrocytic cells, with little virus released into the supernatants (Zheng et al., 2001).",

            "text": "DNA laddering analysis has shown that BeAn virus does not induce apoptosis in astrocytes (Zheng et al., 2001). The ability of GDVII virus to induce apoptosis was assessed based on changes in caspase-3 activity, an enzyme with substrate specificity for the amino acid sequence Asp-Glu-Va1-Asp (Nicholson et al., 1995), since this enzyme is the main executioner caspase in a cascade of proteolytic cleavage events in dying cells. Astrocyte cultures infected at m.o.i.s of 1, 10, and 100 showed a significant increase in caspase-3 activity in comparison with mock-infected cultures (P < 0.05) (Fig. 2). This induction was specific since caspase-3 activity in cells infected at an m.o.i. of 10 and treated with 50 \u03bcM Z-VAD-FMK, the irreversible pan-caspase inhibitor, was not appreciably greater than that in mock-infected cultures. Caspase-3-specific activity was calculated based on a calibration curve using known amounts of chromophore p-nitroaniline (pNA), released from the sustrate upon cleavage by the enzyme. Specific activity was calculated as picomoles of pNA liberated per hour per microgram of cell lysate extracts using the formula provided with the CaspACE kit. Mean specific activities were 96.5 \u00b1 4.9 pmol/\u03bcg for GDVII-infected astrocytes and 24.3 \u00b1 1.6 pmol/\u03bcg for untreated cells. Maximal apoptosis was detected at an m.o.i. of 1. A well-defined positive control is provided by treating cultures with the strong apoptosis inducer Staurosporine (Fig. 2, +).",

None of the purified proteins induced significant caspase-3 activity (Fig. 5). The slight induction by VP2 might reflect some residual intact virus contamination in this particular preparation. Because the TMEV attachment site resides in a structure composed of both VP1 and VP3 proteins (Tyler, 1987), these two purified proteins were added together, as well as the three isolated proteins, without any appreciable induction of apoptosis (not shown). The lack of apoptosis inducing capability of the low-virulence BeAn strain in astrocytic cells is once more demonstrated (Fig. 5, BeAn).",

To determine whether GDVII virus-induced apoptosis involved signaling through TNF family members, the relative changes in expression of TNF-\u03b1 and TRAIL and their respective receptors were examined in GDVII virus-infected cultures. Flow cytometry revealed no increase in TNF-\u03b1 and TRAIL-R in infected versus mock-infected cultures (not shown). Conversely, cytoplasmic TRAIL and surface TNF-R were both upregulated in GDVII-infected cultures (Fig. 6, thick lines). Negative controls were provided by cultures mock-infected or infected with the nonneurovirulent strain BeAn (shaded profiles), or treated with control antibodies (thin lines). The increase in TRAIL and TNF-R was more evident in primary confluent astrocytes that in trypsinized, actively growing cultures (not shown).",

As determined by Scatchard analysis, the Kd of 125I-TNF binding in GDVII virus-infected astrocytes differed only slightly from that of mock-infected cells (2.75 \u00d7 10\u221210 M vs 3.0 \u00d7 10\u221210 M). Nevertheless, 6385 receptors/cell were detected in infected cultures compared to 3258 receptor sites/cell in mock-infected cultures (Fig. 7). This 196% increase in the number of binding sites is essentially similar to a 208% increase previously reported for BeAn virus-infected astrocytes (Aranguez et al., 1995).

Nevertheless, purified TMEV capsid proteins do not induce apoptosis in astrocytes consistent with the failure of TMEV VP2, unlike Coxackievirus VP2, to induce apoptosis in other cells (Henke et al., 2000). The two VP2 proteins differ in their high-variable regions located between amino acids 140 and 200 (Henke et al., 2001).",

However, TRAIL has been reported to be unable to bind TNF-R1 (Pitti et al., 1996), so that the possible interactions between the two signals in our system remain unclear. Astrocytes were the cellular source of signals since potential contamination by microglia, oligodendrocytes, neurons, or meningeal fibroblast was carefully ruled out in our cultures. Thus, astrocytes appear to generate signals for their own programmed death as reported for reovirus infection (Clarke et al., 2000).",

The rabbits were bled 10 days after the last booster and antiserum was frozen at \u221220\u00b0C until used. The specificity of the antibody response was checked by Western immunoblotting using purified TMEV virion proteins separated by SDS\u2013PAGE and showed that the antiserum contained antibodies against VP1 and VP2 capsid proteins. GDVII virus samples at different concentrations in culture medium were incubated with increasing dilution of the rabbit anti-TMEV antiserum for 30 min at 37\u00b0C. Thereafter, the above incubation mixtures were used for infection of astrocyte cultures and further determination of caspase-3 induction.",
