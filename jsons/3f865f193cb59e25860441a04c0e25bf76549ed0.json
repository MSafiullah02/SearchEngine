It is caused by the severe acute respiratory distress syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and has thus far infected >1.5 million people with >500,000 cases in the Unites States alone 1 . Physicians and scientists are working tirelessly to find a potential drug or vaccine for its treatment. Increased disease severity and mortality have been noted in those with cardiovascular disease who develop COVID-19 2 . Moreover, a decreased potassium level has also been reported in patients with COVID-19, which can cause electrocardiographic changes like prolonged QT interval and may increase the risk of adverse reactions with pharmacotherapies. Hence, understanding the cardiovascular risks of potential pharmacotherapies being investigated for COVID-19 is of utmost importance. Numerous drugs are currently under investigation, some in early phase clinical trials. The drugs of highest interest to-date include chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine (CQ/HCQ) alone or in combination with azithromycin, remdesivir, lopinavir/ritonavir and interferon alpha-2b 3 . This article reviews the potential cardiovascular risks associated with these drugs.",

High cumulative doses of CQ/HC have been shown to be associated with atrioventricular blocks and 4 cardiac arrest 5 . Sick sinus syndrome and QT prolongation have also been reported with high doses 6, 7 . In some of these cases, baseline QT interval was found to be mildly prolonged and hence QT interval is such patients should be closely monitored to prevent risk of ventricular arrhythmias. Given the fact that hypokalemia causes prolongation of QTc interval, low potassium levels in patients with severe COVID-19 may further exacerbate the arrhythmogenic potential of CQ/HCQ. CQ has been found to be more associated with conduction defects compared to HCQ. In a study of 85 patients treated with HCQ for a minimum of 1 year and who had no underlying cardiac disease, HCQ was found to be safe with only two patients developing right bundle branch block and one patient developing left bundle branch block 8 .

Favipiravir was reported to be associated with mild prolongation of QT interval in a young patient treated for ebolavirus 27 . High dose of vitamin C was found to be associated with higher cardiovascular mortality in patients with diabetes 28 . Human monoclonal antibodies that inhibit interleukin-6 (IL-6) pathway by binding and blocking IL-6 receptor are also bring currently studied for treatment of COVID-19. They have been shown to cause increases in total cholesterol and LDL levels 29 . A phase 3 trial evaluating colchicine is ongoing for treatment of patients with COVID-19 that plans to enroll 6000 participants[clinicaltrials.gov NCT04322682]; colchicine has not been linked to cardiovascular side effects but may worsen bleeding. Finally, ACE inhibitors and ARBs are also under investigation for the treatment of COVID. SAR-CoV-2 may directly interact with the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System, with the virus using the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as its host receptor on type II pneumocytes. As such, a link between angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) and COVID has been proposed. However, there is little, if any, convincing evidence to suggest discontinuation of such drugs and ARBs are currently undergoing a clinical trial as a treatment for severe COVID-19.",

Though cumulative dose effects impact toxicity, conduction defects, prolongation of QTc interval, cardiomyopathy and ischemic heart disease have been shown to occur with use of hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, azithromycin, remdesivir, interferon-alpha and lopinavir/ritonavir therapies.

Taking into account the published literature, FDA released a statement in 2013 cautioning the use of azithromycin in patients with underlying cardiovascular disease due to risk of fatal arrhythmias 15 . Again, as discussed before, hypokalemia seen in COVID-19 patients can further prolong the QTc interval and cause ventricular arrhythmias. Multiple studies have been performed to evaluate risk of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality with use of azithromycin. In a large cohort study, Ray et al found a 5-day course of azithromycin to be associated with a significantly higher risk of cardiovascular death (hazard ratio HE 2.88, 95% CI 1.79 to 4.63, p<0.001) and all-cause death (HR 1.85, 95% CI 1.25 to 2.75, p=0.002) when compared to those on no antibiotics 16 . However, other studies have found no association between azithromycin and cardiovascular disease or mortality. In a large observational study, Svanstrom et al. found increased risk of cardiovascular death with use of azithromycin when compared to no antibiotic use (rate ratio 2.85, 95% CI 1.13 to 7.24) 17 .",
