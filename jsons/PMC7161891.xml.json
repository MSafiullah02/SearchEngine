            "text": "Emerging infections are defined as infections whose incidence has increased in the past two decades or is at risk for increasing in the near future (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 1998). In recent years, several infections meeting this definition have threatened human health. In some cases, new infections resulted from genetic changes in previous pathogens (e.g., pandemic H1N1 influenza virus [Novel Swine\u2010Origin Influenza et al., 2009], H7N9 influenza virus [Uyeki and Cox, 2013], and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus [Rasmussen et al., 2016b]). In other cases, infections have emerged because of shifts in the geographic distribution of infectious pathogens (e.g., West Nile [Petersen and Roehrig, 2001] and Zika viruses [Petersen et al., 2016]). Infections can also emerge because of breakdowns in public health control measures (e.g., pertussis [Skoff et al., 2015]) or because of inappropriate antimicrobial use (e.g., Clostridium difficile [Lessa et al., 2015]).",

The infant was born without obvious clinical abnormalities and with a normal head circumference. Ophthalmologic examination showed bilateral chorioretinitis, and brain imaging showed severe bilateral white\u2010matter loss and cystic changes consistent with focal cerebral destruction (Alpert et al., 2003). Testing of infant blood and cerebrospinal fluid was positive for WNV\u2010specific immunoglobulin M (IgM), demonstrating WNV transmission from the mother to the fetus (IgM typically does not cross the placenta; thus, a finding of IgM in a newborn provides evidence of intrauterine transmission). However, whether WNV was responsible for the abnormal findings was unknown.",

Ophthalmologic examinations were normal on all infants. On developmental evaluation, the group's mean performance was at or above age level on all domains; one child had a mild delay in one domain, but this was consistent with the expected distribution of Bayley\u2010III scores in the general population.

Developmental evaluation (Bayley\u2010III assessment) showed performance at or above age level domains for the 17 children born to women with WNV infection during pregnancy.

First, as noted previously, a specific and consistent phenotype has not been observed among infants born to WNV\u2010infected mothers, precluding the use of some study designs (case\u2013control studies and birth defects surveillance systems) to investigate the issue. Studies performed thus far have not demonstrated an increased risk for adverse outcomes among infants born to WNV\u2010infected mothers; however, proving that WNV is not a teratogen is difficult. Excluding a small increase in risk requires a very large epidemiologic study, which has not been performed because the number of pregnant women infected with WNV has been relatively small. Only 77 pregnant women were reported to a national West Nile Virus Pregnancy Registry during a 2\u2010year period. Whether this is because few pregnant women were infected or because some WNV infections were missed is unknown; however, a significant proportion of WNV infections are asymptomatic (Pealer et al., 2003), and other WNV infections might not have been recognized and appropriately tested. In addition, limited data from the pregnancy registry suggest that the likelihood of intrauterine transmission of WNV is low because only a few infants have had positive IgM testing; however, the sensitivity of WNV IgM testing to detect congenital infection is unknown (O'Leary et al., 2006).",

However, some teratogens have produced other types of adverse outcomes or outcomes not apparent until later in life (e.g., autism among children and diabetes among adults who were congenitally infected with rubella [Chess, 1977; Sever et al., 1985]). Thus, studies with longer follow\u2010up and that include other adverse outcomes would be needed to state more definitively that WNV is not teratogenic.",

This registry collects information on pregnant women and infants born to women with possible laboratory evidence of Zika infection in the United States and its territories, excluding Puerto Rico, including information on infant growth and development through the first year of life. This registry has already answered several questions; for example, after a report of prolonged Zika viremia in a pregnant woman with an infected fetus (Driggers et al., 2016), early data from the U.S. Zika Pregnancy Registry examined this phenomenon among a larger group of pregnant women (Meaney\u2010Delman et al., 2016). In addition, data from the registry estimated the risk of microcephaly and other defects among women with possible Zika infection during pregnancy in the United States. Approximately 6% of fetuses or infants born to women with laboratory evidence of Zika infection during pregnancy had Zika\u2010associated defects; among those with first trimester infection, the frequency was 11%.

Several challenges to the monitoring of these defects are being addressed. For example, monitoring the prevalence of congenital microcephaly has previously been difficult because of varying methods of case ascertainment and differing case definitions, and birth prevalence estimates from birth defects surveillance systems have varied widely (Cragan et al., 2016). Use of consistent methods of ascertainment and specific case definitions for microcephaly are necessary to improve surveillance quality (Cragan et al., 2016). In addition, birth defects surveillance systems will need to have the ability to ascertain brain findings and other abnormalities beyond microcephaly to improve ascertainment of the spectrum of Zika\u2010associated defects (Trevathan, 2016). Thus, these systems will use rapid, active methods of ascertainment and consistent case definitions for defects believed to be associated with Zika virus infection to enhance the identification of Zika\u2010associated defects. These systems are planned to be complementary to the U.S. Zika Pregnancy Registry and ZAPSS; some infants will be identified by both systems, but infants who were not included in these systems, either because their mothers were not tested or for whom testing was misleading, will be identified by these birth defects surveillance systems if the infant has birth defects believed to be associated with congenital Zika infection (Gilboa et al. \u2013 this issue).",

The wide range of adverse pregnancy outcomes potentially associated with congenital infections makes determining whether a particular adverse outcome was associated with congenital Zika infection or occurred by chance difficult. For example, spontaneous abortions have occurred following prenatal Zika infection; the finding of Zika virus in the products of conception (Martines et al., 2016) suggests that Zika might be a cause of pregnancy loss, but given that pregnancy losses are relatively common, it is difficult to prove that Zika causes spontaneous abortions without collection of epidemiologic data. Although data are sufficient to conclude that Zika infection is a cause of microcephaly and other serious brain anomalies, further studies will be needed to determine the full spectrum of Zika\u2010associated defects. The possibility that more subtle findings, such as cognitive impairment or autism that might not be recognized in infancy, can occur means that even infants who appeared normal at birth might later be recognized as having effects of congenital Zika infection; thus, studies at older ages will be needed.",

This central principle of teratology was well demonstrated by the effects of congenital rubella infection (Webster, 1998). Data suggest that microcephaly and other serious brain anomalies are related to maternal Zika infection during the first or early second trimester; however, data suggest that infections even late in pregnancy might be associated with effects on the infant (Brasil et al., 2016a, 2016b; Soares de Souza et al., 2016).",

Estimates suggest that most persons infected with Zika virus are asymptomatic (Duffy et al., 2009). Early studies in Brazil depended on the presence of a rash to identify a woman as potentially infected with Zika infection (Brasil et al., 2016b; Schuler\u2010Faccini et al., 2016), leaving a significant proportion of infected mothers not identified as having Zika infection. In addition, serologic testing for Zika infection has been complicated: cross\u2010reactivity with other flaviviruses (e.g., dengue, yellow fever) has challenged definitive diagnosis (Rabe et al., 2016). The US Zika Pregnancy Registry and ZAPSS have dealt with this issue by including pregnant women with any laboratory evidence of possible Zika infection; while this approach will decrease the likelihood of women with Zika infection being excluded from the registry, it will likely affect risk estimates for adverse outcomes.",

To examine the effects of WNV during pregnancy, case reports and series, a pregnancy registry, and a prospective cohort analysis were all used. Case\u2013control studies and birth defects surveillance systems were not used to study prenatal effects of WNV, due to the lack of an established phenotype with WNV. In contrast, case\u2013control studies and birth defects surveillance systems, as well as case reports and series, pregnancy registries, and cohort analyses all have been or will be used to study the prenatal effects of Zika infection. Case reports and series were of particular importance in identifying Zika as a teratogen, given the emergence of a recognizable pattern of defects observed in infants with congenital Zika infection (Moore et al., 2016).",
