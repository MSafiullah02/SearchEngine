There is a lack of a versatile method to determine the contaminant distribution in generic buildings with recirculation air. Hiyama et al.

[19] consists of three parts, i.e. ventilated rooms, generalized air handling units (GAHUs) and air openings and ductwork connecting rooms with GAHUs (Fig. 1\n). GAHU is an air handling unit in which return air is handled with or without fresh air mixing. Openings between adjacent spaces such as doors and windows exist in actual buildings to allow the air from one airspace to another. The interacting air flow inevitably transports the contaminant from one airspace to the adjacent airspace. In this case, the interacting air flow between airspaces can be treated as a virtual AHU, as shown in Fig. 2\n. In this virtual AHU, the interacting air is treated as \u2018return air\u2019 for one airspace and the same air is treated as \u2018supply air\u2019 for the adjacent airspace. No fresh air exists in the virtual AHU. Essentially, the interacting air flow has the same feature as the ventilation system with air recirculation, so it can also be included into the generic ventilation system.",

While the iteration method will need 101 min CPU time and 12 simulations (Table 8\n). Fig. 7\nshows the computing time consumption change with case number. As the case number increases (e.g. changes of emission rate of contaminant source, concentration of direct fresh air or the ratio of fresh air), the proposed method will still only need 5 simulations to obtain the accessibility indices and consume the same 48 minutes. The following calculation of supply air concentration and final concentration distribution (by Eqs. (19), (11)) will hardly need time. But for the iteration method, the computing time will increase in proportion with the increase of case number, because it is necessary to do the CFD simulations repeatedly when boundary condition changes. Since it is inevitable to do a large number of case simulations when contaminant dispersion features are studied in a complex building, the proposed method can be much more efficient than the iteration method.",

After obtaining the supply air concentrations of all GAHUs, all the boundary conditions are known for each room, so the final contaminant distributions of all the rooms can be simulated.

In Room 1 both two sources are located in the right area, so they have relatively smaller influence on the left area. In this situation, the effect of supply air concentrations on the concentration distribution of the left area is dominant.

A primary reason for the large discrepancy is that the lumped parameter method supposes the concentrations in all return air outlets in one room are the same, but real return air concentrations are different because of the non-uniform feature in the room. The deviation in the assumption of return air concentration from the real situation will cause different calculated supply air concentrations, and further result in large discrepancy between the proposed method and lumped parameter model.
