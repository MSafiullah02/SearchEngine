Outbreaks of drugresistant pathogens are ignited by the emergence and transmission of mutant variants descended from wild-type strains circulating in the community. In this work we investigate the stochastic dynamics of the emergence of a novel disease strain, introduced into a population in which it must compete with an existing endemic strain. In analogy with past work on single-strain epidemic outbreaks, we apply a branching process approximation to calculate the probability that the new strain becomes established. As expected, a critical determinant of the survival prospects of any invading strain is the magnitude of its reproduction number relative to that of the background endemic strain. Whilst in most circumstances this ratio must exceed unity in order for invasion to be viable, we show that differential control scenarios can lead to less-fit novel strains invading populations hosting a fitter endemic one. This analysis and the accompanying findings will inform our understanding of the mechanisms that have led to past instances of successful strain invasion, and provide valuable lessons for thwarting future drug-resistant strain incursions.",

The incidence of cases exhibiting resistance to both first-and second-line antibiotic treatments continues to rise with endemic levels already witnessed in several regions [25, 19] . Exacerbating the problem is the growing misuse and overuse of antimicrobial agents which, rather than suppressing pathogen strain diversity, often acts to accelerate the spread and diversification of drug-resistant variants [4, 27] . Alarmingly, in many settings, direct transmission of these mutant pathogens is believed to have become the primary source of incident cases [23, 31] suggesting that intervention strategies targeting the transmission and treatment of drug-sensitive strains alone will likely fail. Even with recent increases in funding to combat the rise of antimicrobial resistance [29] , the ongoing arms race between pathogen evolution and the development of novel antibiotics is still being won by the former. Consequently, we are now faced with a rapidly diminishing arsenal of effective therapies -one which may soon prove inadequate [18] .",

Often furthering this challenge is the presence of a resident endemic (possibly ancestral) strain that deprives the newly-emergent mutant of susceptible hosts (e.g., through cross-immunity).

The goal of this paper is to analyze the early-time dynamics of novel strain emergence in a stochastic setting whilst accounting for the background population dynamics associated with endemic infection. In particular, we investigate the conditions under which invasion by a novel strain is possible and calculate the probability of this event occurring, depending on the relative fitness (i.e., reproductive capacity) of the two strains, and the relevant characteristics of the host population (i.e., the heterogeneity in individual reproductive capacity). We then analyze the effects of control strategies and timing on the emergence of novel strains and discuss the implications of differential control efficacy when the invading strain boasts some level of resistance to treatment. The results of this investigation will extend analogous findings in single-strain settings and elucidate the consequences of different control mechanisms/timings in multi-strain systems -particularly the impact of differential control. Moreover the analytical framework that we develop will provide a flexible and robust theoretical basis for future modelling work.",

This outcome becomes increasingly likely as R 0 increases. A significant recent contribution to this theory is the work by Lloyd-Smith et al. [22] in which the authors highlighted the importance of heterogeneity in individual infectiousness among members of the host population and its role in determining the fate of an infectious disease outbreak. By analyzing secondary case counts from several historical infectious disease outbreaks, including the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Singapore, the authors demonstrated that in order to accurately reconstruct observed epidemics, models must account for individual heterogeneity in reproductive potential. In particular, they found that observed secondary case counts follow highly skewed distributions where outbreaks are driven by a small subset of so-called 'super-spreaders': individuals that generate a disproportionately large number of secondary cases, and that the large majority of infected individuals lead to no, or few, secondary infections. As a consequence of this disparity, the probability of extinction increases and epidemics become rarer (but more explosive), as heterogeneity increases. Importantly, their findings show that previous analyses that rely solely on population mean parameters -such as the basic reproduction number R 0 -to model outbreak dynamics inadequately capture the true stochastic nature of disease spread, because the prospects of an epidemic outbreak depend critically on the distribution of infection potential within the host population.",

Second, we demonstrate that the time at which control measures are implemented has a substantial impact on the effectiveness of control for preventing the emergence of new strains, and that this varied by the chosen means of control. Third, in the case of differential control, where the invading strain shows some level of resistance to the applied control measure, we found regions of parameter space for which control was detrimental and increasing c increased the invasion probability of the new strain. Hence, when control impacts the invading strain differently to the resident, this can (in some cases) facilitate the emergence of the invading strain, relative to the control-free case.",

That is, random, polarized control provides greater protection against potential strain invasions. This is again consistent with results around invasion in na\u00efve populations [22] . This could provide an important consideration for managers choosing control strategies when concerns exist around AMR. Of course, more targeted control measures directed towards the most highly infectious members of the host population -socalled 'super-spreaders' -would outperform both the random and uniform control scenarios considered here; however, identifying such groups a priori, if possible, may be difficult in practice.",

We note that the latter case, where control exists prior to the introduction of the invading strain, is likely to be more realistic, given the desire to control existing outbreaks. The difference between these two cases is the number of susceptible individuals made available to the newly introduced invading strain. In the simultaneous case, the susceptible pool remains depleted by the presence of the resident strain such that the invading strain is inhibited by both a reduced S(t = 0) = N/R r 0 and the added burden of control. In the prior scenario, the susceptible population has been replenished by control measures applied to the resident strain, S(t = 0) = N/((1 \u2212 c)R r 0 ). In this latter case, the effects of uniform control on the invading strain are negated by the increase in available susceptibles: R i eff,c = R eff . Only once the level of control is sufficient to eradicate the resident strain, i.e., c > 1 \u2212 1/R r 0 (and the susceptible population then becomes the whole population, N ) does uniform control start to impede the invasion prospects of the invading strain. Conversely, implementing a random, polarized control strategy is always beneficial provided the control measure is equally effective against both the resident and invading strains.",

If this were not the case, the resident infection would likely impact which susceptibles are available to the invader, requiring a more complex modelling framework. For example, given that both infection potential and susceptibility are functions of the number of contacts an individual experiences, these quantities may be naturally correlated. Leventhal et al. [6] approach this problem by imposing an explicit contact-network structure on the study population, such that heterogeneity in susceptibility was directly linked to the heterogeneity in infectiousness through the (fixed) number of contacts shared by each individual. In this context, invasion events were found to be less likely because potential 'super-spreading' hosts (or hubs in the network) were often already infected with the resident strain meaning they were unable to perpetuate the spread of the invading strain, whilst simultaneously providing protection to susceptible satellite nodes. Given these findings, it would be interesting to consider more general correlation structures between susceptibility and infectiousness and their effect on strain invasion potential in a generalized branching process framework.",

While this does not influence the impacts of control qualitatively, we emphasize that under the branching process approximation it does impact how likely the invading strain is to establish. In particular, invaders are less likely to establish when individual reproductive capacities are more highly dispersed. However, we note that this heterogeneity also has a subtler effect: the error between simulated epidemic results and the branching process approximation varies in both magnitude, and direction, with k ( Figure 9 ). One clear possibility is that if a 'super-spreader' individual emerges early in an outbreak, it may allow a strain to establish itself when it otherwise would not have. In addition, since the heterogeneity also influences the resident strain, increased heterogeneity both enables the natural extinction of the resident strain (Figure 10) , and more generally variation of the initial susceptible proportion faced by the invader away from N/R r 0 . Applying a branching process approximation for the emergence of a new strain in the presence of an endemic background, rather than into a na\u00efve population, requires care. Our simulation study determined that the approximation was quite robust even for relatively small populations (e.g., N \u2265 500). However, there was some variation due to different parameter choices at smaller population sizes. In particular, accuracy varied when heterogeneity in individual reproductive capacity was high, and when parameter choices caused the endemic disease to be at risk of natural extinction (even without the influence of the invader). We also emphasize that the branching process approximation is limited in that it can only quantify the probability of initial strain extinction: there is likely some additional probability of subsequent fade-out due to depletion of susceptibles (e.g., sensu Ballard et al. [3] ). A separate analysis would be necessary to investigate this phenomenon.",

Transitions in this model are somewhat unconventional. We assume the infectious duration of each individual is constant, rather than random, with value 1/\u03b3 (and for simplicity we set \u03b3 = 1, without loss of generality). Each infected individual j (when infected) has their own individual reproductive capacity, \u03bd j , Gamma distributed with mean R s 0 and dispersion parameter k, where s is the strain they are infected with. Infection events occur according to a Poisson process, with rate S N \u22121 j\u2208infected \u03bd j , i.e., where one would normally expect a \u03b2I transmission term when infection rates are homogeneous, we instead have j\u2208infected \u03bd j . The combination of the deterministic infectious period and the Gamma-distributed individual reproductive capacity results in this situation being equivalent to that considered throughout the manuscript. Recovered individuals have waning immunity, occurring according to a Poisson process with rate \u03b7R.",
