SARS is characterised by symptoms that include a temperature over 38\u00b0C, dry cough, myalgia, and mild sore throat, which progresses to atypical pneumonia. The disease is unusual in its high morbidity and mortality rates; and it mimics and indeed rivals the 1918 influenza pandemic, which still stands as the worst pandemic in history.1 More disturbingly, SARS seems to transmit through direct contact and extreme infection-control measures are thus needed in affected areas.2\n",

In addition to identifying small clusters of inherited mutations that are lineage-specific and can be used as molecular signatures to track transmission, the results suggest a remarkable genetic conservation of the virus since the outbreak was first documented in February, 2003. Although there are a handful of mutations between isolates, they may be due to adaption in culture. Previous experience with the evolution of influenza A virus shows that such \u201cend-of-lineage\u201d changes are due to mutations selected in laboratory culture.10 In Ruan's study, most of the mutations in the SARS-CoV sequences probably represent adaption to Vero cells during propagation before sequencing. It can therefore be concluded that as the virus passes through human beings, SARS-CoV is maintaining its consensus genotype and is thus well adapted to the human host. This finding may indeed be a double-edged sword.",

Any disease property that enhances transmission to new hosts will be the subject of positive evolutionary selective pressures.11 Experimental analysis of viral evolution shows that genomic stability in a specific host is a function of viral population size-passage of large populations results in increased replicative fitness and virulence due to the competitive selection of optimising mutations.12 By contrast, passage of limiting dosages results in decreased replicative fitness and attenuation due to the adventitious trapping of deleterious mutations. The hope with SARS-CoV is that it will attenuate its properties in human beings. Sadly, Ruan and colleagues\u2019results suggest that this attenuation does not seem to be happening at a rapid rate and may indicate a worrisome epidemiological trend.",

However, coronaviruses can transduce genes from foreign genomes, recombine with other coronaviruses, and mutate to drive rapid and extreme evolution-presumably SARS-CoV is a product of such evolution. Furthermore, SARS-CoV was found in the faeces of patients,3 which indicates more than one tissue tropism. This discovery also raises the slight possibility of transmission through water in which the property of high virulence can be maintained under conditions that allow untreated sewage contamination of surface and ground waters.11 In addition, animal and human experiences with coronaviruses have illustrated a range of problems, including a lack of protective immunity, persistent infection, and immune enhancement (in which antiviral antibodies increase disease progression). This latter problem may explain in part the relatively high mortality rate. If a vaccine is possible, there is a long way to go.",

Where and how did SARS arise? A great deal of retrospective isolation and genomic sequencing of human and animal coronaviruses, especially in the virological hotbed of southern China, is required for the molecular sleuthing needed to solve this puzzle. SARS-CoV possesses a novel organisation of five open-reading frames that encode proteins with as yet unknown functions which, from experience with other viruses, may encode antagonists of innate and adaptive immunity.13 Much like the human genome, the SARS-CoV genetic code charts a detailed roadmap through unknown territories. Molecular virologists now need to interpret gene function from this genetic sequence, which will not be easy given that single aminoacid changes can dramatically affect biological function.",
