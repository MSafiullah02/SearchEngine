            "text": "Human cathelicidin LL-37 has several limitations as a therapeutic molecule. First, it is relatively long with 37 amino acids. Second, it can be rapidly degraded by proteases. Third, it can lose activity under certain conditions. The design of engineered LL-37 aimed to overcome these limitations. We have previously identified the major active region of LL-37 corresponding to residues 17-32 (Li et al., 2006 , Wang et al., 2008 . Since numerous natural peptides starts with a glycine, we added a glycine to residues 17-32 of LL-37, leading to the generation of GF-17. Based on GF-17, we designed multiple peptides and conducted a simultaneous screening of peptide activity and stability to proteases. The screening identified the GF-17d3 template, which incorporated three D-form leucine residues and was active in the presence of chymotrypsin. Three-dimensional structure analysis identified a structural defect in GF-17d3 (Li et al., 2006 , Wang et al., 2008 . To fill in the structural defect, we replaced phenylalanine at positions 17 and 27 with biphenylalanine, leading to the generation of 17BIPHE2 which is stable to multiple proteases (Wang, 2008) (referred as \"17BI\" in this manuscript). In another study, we found that GI-20 (with three amino acid-extension at the Nterminus of GF-17) had increased activity in inhibiting HIV-1 (Wang et al., 2014) . To increase GI-20 stability, we engineered GI-20 with all D-amino acids, leading to the generation of GI-20d. Further shortening of GF-17 made the peptide inactive. One of the peptides is RI-10 (Li et al., 2006 , Wang et al., 2008 which was used as a negative control in this study.",

Several antibodies were tested with each virus, and the antibodies that gave the highest signal-to-noise ratio in the IFA were used for screening purposes. Cells were washed three times with PBS, blocked in 3% bovine serum albumin/PBS, and treated with the corresponding primary antibody at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h followed by three additional washes with 1\u00d7 PBS and secondary antibody treatment. The mouse monoclonal antibodies 6D8 and 9G4 were used to detect EBOV GP, and MARV GP respectively. All antibodies to viral antigens were purified from the hybridoma stocks at USAMRIID. Cell nuclei and cytoplasm were labeled with Hoechst 33342 (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) and HCS CellMask Red or Deep Red (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA), respectively, at a 1:10,000 dilution. Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:1000; Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) were used to visualize primary antibodies.",

Peptides were added to cells 2 hrs prior to the start of virus infection. Each concentration of peptide were tested in quadruplicate. Data generated from the image analysis were plotted and analyzed using Genedata software (Basel, Switzerland) The IC50, defined as the effective concentration resulting in a 50% inhibition of viral infection, was used to evaluate peptide activity. Peptide toxicity was determined by normalizing the cell number of peptide treated + virus-infected cells with mock treated (0.5% DMSO) + virus-infected cells, which were considered as 100%. The TC50 value, defined as the compound concentration resulting in a 50% reduction in cell viability (based on normalized data) compared with mock infection, was used to evaluate cell toxicity.",
