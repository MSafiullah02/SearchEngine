A fluorescent focus reduction assay15 was used to measure virus titer before and after disinfection. For this assay, confluent monolayers of Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells were prepared in 96-well plates. Each well was inoculated with 50 \u03bcL of a virus suspension and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 45 minutes in a 5% CO2 environment. After infected cells were washed with an assay medium comprising Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Mediatech, Herndon, VA) with 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) (SeraCare, Milford, MA), the cells were incubated for 7 hours at 37\u00b0C in a 5% CO2 environment. After incubation, the cells were washed 3 times with Dulbecco's phosphate buffer saline with calcium and magnesium (DPBS++) (Hyclone Laboratories, Logan, UT) and fixed with an aqueous solution of 80% acetone for 10 minutes at 4\u00b0C. Infected MDCK cells were then labeled for 30 minutes at 4\u00b0C with 50 \u03bcL of nucleoprotein antibody solution, which was made by adding 50 \u03bcL of mouse monoclonal antibodies (catalog no. VS2366; Centers for Disease Control, Atlanta, GA) to 5 mL of Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS) (Hyclone Laboratories) containing 1% BSA, 1% heat-inactivated human serum (Mediatech), and 0.02% sodium azide. After 3 washes with DPBS, the cells were incubated with tagging solution, made by adding 50 \u03bcL of rhodamine-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG (catalog no. 115026062; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) to 5 mL of DPBS containing 1% BSA, 1% heat-inactivated human serum, and 0.02% sodium azide. The number of cells with fluorescent foci, referred to as fluorescent focus units (FFUs), was then counted using an Olympus CKX-41 inverted fluorescent microscope (Olympus, Center Valley, PA). Based on this assay, the titer of the single-use packets of influenza virus suspension after thawing was about 109 FFUs/mL.",

Because we allowed a large pool of nearly pure liquid TEG located on the floor of the well-mixed exposure chamber to reach equilibrium with the gas phase, the air was essentially saturated with TEG, and the partial pressure of TEG (pTEG) was approximately equal to its vapor pressure (PTEGo). TEG vapor pressure can be calculated from the Antoine equation,17\n(1)log10PTEGo=6.757\u22123715T\u22121.299,where vapor pressure is in bars and absolute temperature (T) is in\u00b0K. Based on eq (1), which was specified for a temperature range that did not include 25\u00b0C, the vapor pressure of TEG at 25\u00b0C is 0.00131 mm Hg, which is in nearly perfect agreement with the value of 0.00132 mm Hg at 25\u00b0C given by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).12 The TEG mole fraction (yTEG) in the gas phase can be calculated from Dalton's law,(2)yTEG=pTEGP\u2245PTEGoP=0.0013760\u00d7106=1.7ppmwhere P is ambient pressure. Actually, because liquid TEG is so hydroscopic, the pool of TEG on the chamber floor would tend to become diluted with water over time, so that the mole fraction of TEG vapor would be somewhat less than 1.7 ppm. But because of the relatively large amount of liquid TEG in the chamber, dilution would not be expected to have a very significant effect on TEG vapor concentration.",

This trend holds for all HP vapor concentrations evaluated. For example, at a HP vapor concentration of 90 ppm (the highest concentration tested), the number of log10 reductions was 3.2 after 2.5 minutes of exposure, 4.5 after 10 minutes of exposure, and 4.7 after 15 minutes of exposure.",

If the number of log10 reductions at 10 ppm HP vapor versus exposure time were linear, then 15 minutes of exposure would have resulted in sterilization (12 log10 reductions). Instead, because of the nonlinearity of the curve, only 3.6 log10 reductions were measured after 15 minutes of exposure to 10-ppm HP vapor. This is a significant reduction for such a low HP vapor concentration. The 8-hour time-weighted average threshold limit value (TLV)18 and Occupational Safety and Health Administration permissible exposure limit19 for occupational HP vapor exposure are both 1 ppm. This suggests that 10-ppm HP vapor is a relatively safe concentration over a brief period, although the TLV includes the caveat that HP vapor is a confirmed animal carcinogen with unknown relevance to humans.",

Alternatively, micrometer-size TEG droplets, which evaporate rapidly, could be injected into the supply air duct or directly into the space. The standard method for introducing TEG droplets into the air for the purpose of air disinfection is through the use of a pressurized liquid,12 although a nebulizer could be used as well. If a pandemic were to occur, both surface and air disinfection could take place simultaneously even while people occupied the space. Although an objection could be raised due to the potential health risk of using TEG vapor for air disinfection, this concern is likely unwarranted, because TEG is an odorless chemical of no known toxicity, and human exposure to TEG is already widespread. TEG vapor is used as a bacteriostat to kill odor-causing bacteria for the purpose of air sanitation and deodorization. It was first registered for use in hospitals as an air disinfectant in 1947. Present application scenarios include spraying TEG inside offices, schools, hotels, lobbies, theaters, reception rooms, sleeping rooms, bathrooms, and hospital rooms.20 In addition, products containing TEG packaged in aerosol cans and designed to be sprayed into the air inside homes to control odors (eg, Oust, Febreze) are sold in stores everywhere.",

The toxicology database is adequate to characterize the hazard of triethylene glycol, and no data gaps have been identified.

At 25\u00b0C, however, the concentration of TEG in air cannot exceed 1.7 ppm, because air is saturated at that concentration. The only way to increase concentration is to increase temperature. As shown in Table 1\n, which was calculated from eqs (1) and (2), modest increases in temperature result in significant increases in TEG vapor concentration. For example, the concentration is more than 4 times higher at 35\u00b0C (95\u00b0F) than at 25\u00b0C. Thus, further work investigating TEG vapor as a disinfecting agent is warranted. Specifically, the effectiveness of TEG vapor for surface disinfection at higher concentrations (ie, at temperatures above room temperature) should be investigated, and the influence of RH on the effectiveness of disinfection should be evaluated.",
