It assessed the difference in performance between (1) attending 1 instructor-led training session in donning and doffing PPE at 1 month prior to assessment, and (2) watching training videos for 1 month. Methods: This randomized controlled trial pilot study divided 21 medical students and junior doctors into 2 groups. Control group participants attended 1 instructor-led training session. Video group participants watched training videos demonstrating the same procedures, which they could freely watch again at home. After 1 month, a doctor performed a blind evaluation of performance using checklists. Results: Nineteen participants were assessed after 1 month. The mean donning score was 84.8/100 for the instructor-led group and 88/100 for the video group; mean effect size was 3.2 (95% CI: -7.5 to 9.5). The mean doffing score was 79.1/100 for the instructor-led group and 73.9/100 for the video group; mean effect size was 5.2 (95% CI: -7.6 to 18). Conclusion: Our study found no significant difference in donning and doffing scores between instructor-led and video lessons. Video training could be a fast and resource-efficient method of training in PPE donning and doffing in responding to the COVID-19 pandemic.",

First, it is time-consuming for both trainees and instructors. Second, gathering people together to be trained in person increases the risk of exposing staff to infection. 1 Third, the rapid growth in numbers of cases of infection and disruptions in the global supply chain of PPE presents a real risk of shortages of this equipment. 2 Therefore, alternative training methods should be considered.",

This may have helped their performance and might explain why some participants from the video group performed even better than those who had received training with the instructor 1 month previously. Just-in-time training, whereby information is provided at the time it is needed, has been proven to be effective in teaching other procedures. Jones et al. compared differences in just-intime training between video presentation and small group demonstrations for fit testing N-95 respirator face masks. Fit testing of N-95 is also a part of PPE donning. There were no differences between the groups when assessment was done immediately. 4 However, donning and doffing PPE is much more complicated because it consists of procedures that not only need to be performed correctly, but also in the right sequence, and this is of very high importance. Successful performance by video group participants may have been aided by other factors, such as repetition of the material, not only the possibility to study immediately prior to assessment.",
