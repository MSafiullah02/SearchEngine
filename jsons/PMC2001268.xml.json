The viruses are enveloped and contain a single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome that ranges in size from 27 to 31 kb. All of the viruses have at least four structural proteins. The spike (S), membrane (M) and envelope (E) proteins are anchored in the virion envelope. The nucleocapsid (N) protein encapsidates the viral genome as a helical nucleocapsid inside the virion (Davies et al., 1981, Macnaughton et al., 1978).",

Through its interactions with the viral RNA, the M protein and itself, N plays important roles in virus assembly (Escors et al., 2001, Hurst et al., 2005, Narayanan et al., 2003, Narayanan and Makino, 2001, Verma et al., 2006). The protein is also involved in viral RNA transcription and/or replication (Baric et al., 1988, Chang and Brian, 1996, Compton et al., 1987, Denison et al., 1999, van der Meer et al., 1999). Recent studies with coronavirus infectious clones provided direct evidence for a role of the N protein in replication and/or transcription (Almazan et al., 2004, Casais et al., 2001, Yount et al., 2000). The protein may also play a role in viral mRNA translation (Tahara et al., 1994). Additionally, MHV A59 and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) N proteins are type I interferon antagonists (Kopecky-Bromberg et al., 2007, Ye et al., 2007).",

The mass is representative of a doubly charged ion with a decrease in mass of 98 atomic mass units (amu), which is equal to the loss of one phosphoric acid group (H3PO4) from the precursor ion m/z\n = 703.32+. Since this peptide contained only one serine, MS3 analysis was not necessary. Other intense peaks were assigned as b- and y-series sequence ions which result from the usual fragmentation of peptides at their amide bonds (Fig. 2). These results confirmed preliminary results from earlier MALDI analysis in our lab which indicated that S389 was phosphorylated (White and Hogue, 2006).",

The earlier conclusions were made based on phosphoamino acid analysis of [32P]-labeled N peptides. Identification of the phosphorylated threonine residues in our study may reflect differences in the experimental approaches used to isolate and/or analyze the protein. Interestingly, based on comparative analysis of earlier HPLC of tryptic peptides derived from the N proteins of MHV A59 and a plaque variant of the JHM virus, it was suggested that serine at positions 161 and 162, respectively, were phosphorylated (Wilbur et al., 1986).

While our work was in progress the phosphorylated sites on the N protein were identified for two other coronaviruses. Phosphoserines at positions 9, 156, 254 and 256 were identified for the group I TGEV protein from virus infected cells, whereas only sites S156 and S256 were identified on the N protein present in purified virions (Fig. 8) (Calvo et al., 2005). The sites that are phosphorylated on the group III IBV N protein expressed with baculovirus in insect cells were found to be identical to the ones on the N protein expressed alone in Vero cells (Chen et al., 2005). Data from the study suggests that S190, S192, T378 and S379 are phosphorylated on intracellular IBV N (Fig. 8). Comparison of the sites for the three viruses illustrates that the location is not conserved, but phosphorylated sites are near either the amino or carboxy side of the serine/arginine (SR) rich domain that is conserved in all coronavirus N proteins. The SR rich domain is a distinguishing feature of the previously identified MHV RNA binding domain (Fig. 7, Fig. 8).",

            "text": "Recently structural information became available for IBV and SARS-CoV N proteins. The three-dimensional structures are based on NMR analysis of amino acids 45\u2013181 (Huang et al., 2004) and X-ray crystal structures of the amino-terminal residues of IBV 19/29-160/162 (Fan et al., 2005, Jayaram et al., 2006) and SARS-CoV 47-175 (Saikatendu et al., 2007). Crystal structures have also been determined for carboxy-terminal residues 219\u2013349 of IBV N (Jayaram et al., 2006) and residues 270\u2013370 of SARS-CoV N (Yu et al., 2006). Based solely on amino acid alignments, this corresponds to the region encompassing roughly R45-N195 in the MHV A59 N protein (Fig. 8). No structural information is yet available for MHV N, but based on the sequence alignments we can speculate about the potential positions of the phosphorylated sites on MHV N. The sites in the amino terminal region (S162, S170, T177) potentially fall within a large loop between \u03b2-strands (\u03b26 and \u03b27 of SARS amino-terminus) (Saikatendu et al., 2007). These sites are adjacent to the previously identified MHV RNA binding domain that extends from T177 to P231 (Fig. 7, Fig. 8) (Nelson et al., 2000). Localization of the phosphorylation sites near this domain could influence presentation of the RNA binding domain and in turn interaction with the RNA. Clearly, much remains to be understood about, not only the structure of the MHV N protein, but also its functional domains compared with other coronavirus nucleocapsids. RNA binding domains for IBV and SARS-CoV are located in the amino-terminal domain preceding the serine-rich domain (Fan et al., 2005, Huang et al., 2004, Saikatendu et al., 2007). Mutagenesis of a positively charged \u03b2-hairpin within the amino-terminus of IBV N identified residues involved in RNA-binding in vitro, and when introduced into an infectious clone virus replication was attenuated (Tan et al., 2006). Kinetic analysis of the amino-terminus of IBV N showed that the domain binds viral RNA, but the full length protein exhibits stronger binding, suggesting that interactions with other regions of the protein are also important (Spencer and Hiscox, 2006). The conserved SR domain has been proposed to link the amino-terminal RNA binding and carboxy-terminal multimerization domains of IBV and SAR-CoV (Fan et al., 2005, Saikatendu et al., 2007). All of the identified phosphorylation sites on the IBV N protein are located on the carboxy side of its SR domain. The presence of phosphorylated residues in close proximity to the MHV SR domain may uniquely influence how the surrounding domains interact with viral RNA. Modeling of other coronavirus N proteins based on the crystal forms of SARS-CoV and IBV amino-terminal domains indicate that the proteins are similar in the overall organization of \u03b2-strands, but since the proteins differ in their surface charge distribution patterns, it was speculated that the residues involved in RNA binding and how they interact with the RNA is different (Saikatendu et al., 2007). In the case of MHV N, the presence of phosphorylated residues between the amino-end and the SR domain may contribute to this difference.",

The results are consistent with earlier suggestions for a potential role of N phosphorylation (Laude and Masters, 1995, Nelson et al., 2000). Affinity for viral RNA could play a role in assembly or uncoating. Dephosphorylation of MHV N protein has been suggested to facilitate infection (Mohandas and Dales, 1991). Virion associated kinase activity has been reported for MHV JHM, but whether it plays any role during infection is not known (Siddell et al., 1981). Phosphorylation of N could be important in whatever role the protein plays in viral RNA transcription and/or replication. Phosphorylation may alter the structure of the N protein and in turn presentation of RNA binding domain(s) that is important for recognition of the packaging signal, transcription regulatory sequences or other signature sequences in the viral RNA(s). It was recently demonstrated that TGEV and SARS-CoV N proteins have RNA chaperone activity (Zuniga et al., 2007). We fully agree with the suggestion that phosphorylation may have a role in this activity.",

We did not detect any difference in phosphorylation of the protein from the infected cells and that in extracellular virions. It should be noted that coronaviruses assemble at intracellular membranes in the region of the endoplasmic reticulum Golgi complex (ERGIC) (Krijnse-Locker et al., 1994). The details of virus release are not fully understood, but virions are thought to transport through the constitutive secretory pathway after budding. Thus, the intracellular fraction in our study no doubt contained some assembled virions that had not been secreted, which would contribute to the profile of sites that were identified. Our identification of the same sites on both intracellular and virion N differs from the results from recent analysis of TGEV N as discussed above. Four sites were found to be phosphorylated on the protein from infected cells, while only two of these were identified on extracellular virion N (Calvo et al., 2005). What accounts for the difference is not known. It may reflect a basic difference between MHV and TGEV. Calvo et al. (2005) suggested the possibility that phosphorylation/dephosphorylation could play a role in TGEV assembly. We previously suggested that a more highly phosphorylated isoform of the N protein exists in BCoV (Hogue, 1995) and MHV infected cells (Hogue, unpublished data). We also hypothesized that nucleocapsids might undergo dephosphorylation during assembly into virions. We did not attempt to identify phosphorylation sites on different isoforms in the present study. Excised gel pieces included both forms of the protein that we previously suggested might be differentially phosphorylated based solely on phosphatase digestion results. Others have reported differences in the phosphorylation status of intracellular and virions N proteins. IBV virion N protein was reported to be more phosphorylated than the protein in virus infected cells (Jayaram et al., 2005).",
