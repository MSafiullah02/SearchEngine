Although the term COPD as commonly used encompasses a wide variety of patients with the underlying common denominator of limitation of airflow, most of these patients fall into the major categories of chronic bronchitis, asthma, and emphysema. ~1any of these patients manifest an overlap syndrome made up of several or all of the components. The term chronic bronchitis denotes a clinical syndrome characterized by chronic or recurrent bronchial hypersecretion clinically diagnosed by the presence of chronic productive cough with no other cause such as infection, neoplasm, or cardiac disease. The sputum may be mucous, purulent, or eosinophilic in character. 2. 22 The mechanisms of airflow limitation are related to generalized hypcrtrophy and hyperplasia of the mucus-secreting bronchial glands, diffuse inflammation with thickening of the tracheobronchial submucosa, and secretions in the airways. Asthma is characterized by an increased responsiveness of the tracheobronchial tree to various stimuli and is manifested by diffuse narrowing of the airways, which is reversible either spontaneously or as a result of therapy. The airflow limitation results from a combination of mucous plugging of the airways, smooth muscle hypertrophy and constriction, goblet cell hyperplasia, and diffuse mucosal edema. 2 Pulmonary emphysema is defined pathologically as an abnormal enlargement of the airspaces distal to the terminal bronchioles associated with destruction of the alveolar walls. 2 Airflow limitation results from the collapse of small airways due to loss of the elastic recoil of the lung parenchyma, which aids in maintaining the patency of the small bronchioles.",

            "text": "Hypoxemia COPD patients with severely decreasing vital capacities, decreasing timed forced expiratory volumes, increasing airway resistance, and increasing thoracic gas volumes show declining arterial P02 values. Although these patients have an increased workload of breathing due to their increased airflow resistance, they have normal oxygen consumption at rest. Initially, they are able to maintain these levels of oxygen consumption despite reduced oxyhemoglobin saturation by increasing oxygen extraction at the tissue level. They appear able to extract more oxygen, thus decreasing their mixed-venous oxygen saturation below normal levels. The difference between arterial and mixed-venous oxygen content therefore remains normal. Eventually, however, a critical level of mixed-venous oxygen is reached, reduction below which is not tolerated because of the risk of tissue damage. At this point, the body compensates by increasing the hemoglobin concentration. 17 Erythrocytosis is a common finding in patients with long-standing hypoxemia. 5 , 17, 60, 68 The average increase in hematocrit and hemoglobin in hypoxemic patients with COPD is generally moderate, being 57% and 17 g/100 ml, respectively. Hemoglobin levels greater than 20 g/lOO ml are uncommon. The increased red cell mass that these patients develop actually correlates better with the degree of arterial oxygen de saturation than do either the hematocrit or hemoglobin. 5 Another cause of erythrocytosis is smoking, which is almost universal in this group of patients. Increased levels of carboxyhemoglobin lead to decreased levels of oxyhemoglobin saturation, despite normal Po2 \u2022 The tissue hypoxia may thus contribute to the stimulus for erythrocytosis. 56 The erythrocytosis maintains an adequate blood oxygen content despite severe hypoxemia and oxyhemoglobin desaturation.",

This is explained by an increased red cell 2,3-diphosphoglycerate levei, as well as by a reduced pH. 17 An increased cardiac output does not appear to be a compensating mechanism for the hypoxemia. 17 In the normal individual, an increased cardiac output is the usual response to increased tissue oxygen needs. High pulmonary vascular resistance, however, counteracts the attempts at increasing cardiac output, resulting in normal or low cardiac output. 17, 41 Acid Base Status Arterial Peo 2 and pH provide major clues as to the acuteness or chronicity of the respiratory decompensation. Pure respiratory failure leads to an elevated Paeo2 and a reduced pH. In patients with chronic respiratory failure, renal mechanisms come into play to return the pH toward normal. COPD patients with chronic CO 2 retention present with elevated serum bicarbonate levels that are evidence of compensatory renal mechanisms. In addition, they have evidence of renal dysfunction related to chronic hypercapnia and/or hypoxemia.

When arterial P02 is > 125 Torr, renal plasma flow and glomerular filtration rates are reduced.

It has been shown that smokers have higher drug clearances and require 0.8 mg/kg/h, while patients with pneumonia or congestive heart failure have lower clearances and require doses as low as 0.2 mg/kg/h. 53 Aminophylline clearances vary markedly in critically ill patients, however, and serum levels should be monitored every 24 hours until stable and every 48 hours thereafter, with appropriate dosage changes made. 70 Maintaining serum concentrations between 15 and 20 mg/L are more effective than lower levels and are associated with greater improvement in pulmonary function and a shorter duration of the need for intravenous (IV) medication, 69 It should be kept in mind that IV aminophylline may not make any difference in patients who have only a minor asthmatic component to their disease or have already been on oral preparations. 59 Additionally, since these patients often have been on oral preparations, the usual loading dose of 6 mg/kg aminophylline may not be necessary and, in fact, can lead to toxicity.",

            "text": "Beta-adrenergic drugs are useful in combination with theophyllines since their modes of action may complement each other. Beta agonists directly stimulate the production of bronchial smooth muscle cyclic AMP, while theophyllines inhibit phosphodiesterases and block the breakdown of cyclic AMP. This leads to smooth muscle relaxation and bronchodilation. Beta agonists can be given orally, parenterally, or by inhalation, Terbutaline, isoetharine, metaproterenol, and albuterol preparations are all available for administration by one or more routes. The choice of route depends on the clinical situation, Oral or parcnteral administration theoretically will have an effect on both the large and small airways, but have the drawback of potential systemic side efFects, Inhaled medication works primarily at the larger airway level, but has the disadvantage that in some patients, bronchospasm may actually be induced by a deep inspiration with a metered dose inhaler, In critically ill patients, a nebulizer should be used to reduce the potential for paradoxic bronchospasm, In addition to the pulmonary effects, beta2-adrenergic drugs, such as terbutaline, also have positive cardiovascular effects by improving right and left ventricular performance, 9, 2, 5 In recent years, there has been a resurgence of interest in the use of anticholinergic drugs, such as atropine methonitrate and ipratropium bromide, in the management of obstructive lung disease, 24, 28, 38, 51 The mechanism of action of these drugs appears to be a blocking of the normal baseline cholinergic tone to the bronchial smooth muscle, thus resulting in bronchodilation. 24 Responsiveness to anticholinergic drugs appears greatest in chronic bronchitis and emphysema, as opposed to classic atopic asthma;2' in the former group of patients, the bronchodilating response is greater than it is to beta-agonist drugs. 24, 51 The appropriate dosage of atropine methonitrate is 0.f)25 to 0.05 mg/kg by nebulization. 5o Corticosteroids play a role in the management of the compromised COPD patient. The mechanism of action is unclear; however, a beneficial effect in the asthmatic component of the disease is well known. Patients with an atopic history, reversibility of obstruction following bronchodilators, or having blood or sputum eosinophilia are those most likely to respond. 57 Data are conflicting as to the efficacy in patients who have primarily emphysema or bronchitis. In patients without definite asthma, steroids should be tried; however, a definite endpoint must be set to determine a response. Oral doses in the range of 30 to 40 mg/d are appropriate initially during an acute flare. IV dosage should be in the range of 0.5 m/kg every 6 hours of methylprednisolone or the equivalent dose of hydrocortisone. 1 , 19 There is no evidence that therapy with higher doses of corticosteroids has any benefit in this group of patients. 66 Hypoxemia should be treated with supplemental oxygen to improve tissue oxygenation as well as to relieve hypoxic-induced pulmonary hypertension. Because of the potential for suppression of ventilation discussed above, it is important to administer oxygen in a controlled fashion, using a venturi-type mask delivering an inspired fraction of oxygen of 0.24 or 0.28. Delivering oxygen by nasal cannula does not provide a flow that is adequately quantifiable. The breathing pattern of a critically ill patient is such that, with rapid shallow respirations, the fraction of oxygen delivered to the patient at 1 to 2 Llmin by nasal cannula may actually be equivalent to greater than 0.30, which might prove to be excessive. It is unknown which patients will have ventilatory drive suppressed by supplemental oxygen; close clinical observation is required. Using an oxygen tension/carbon dioxide tension diagram, Bone and coworkers suggested that severe hypoxemia and acidosis initially are more discriminatory for CO2 retention than baseline hypercarbia. 7 Increased secretions should be treated aggressively. Eosinophilic sputum responds well to corticosteroids. Purulent secretions should be man-aged with bronchial hygiene techniques and chest physical therapy. The use of antibiotics in this setting is controversial. Since the usual infectious etiology of acute bronchitis is viral, it theoretically would not matter if antibiotics directed against bacteria were used. Studies have found both a benefit 67 and no benefit.47 Despite this data, most clinicians would treat a purulent bronchitis without evidence of an obvious pneumonia with a broad spectrum antibiotic, such as ampicillin or a cephalosporin.",

If the respiratory failure is the result of an obviously reversible process, the decision is easy and the patient should be intubated. If the cause of the failure is a gradual deterioration of the patient's underlying lung disease, the decision to intubate or not is more difficult and should take into account ethical as well as medical issues. Basic ventilatory management is well described elsewhere. 6 There are several features of ventilator management that are unique to this group of patients. The minute volume that these patients receive should be adjusted to maintain a pH between 7.35 and 7.40. One should not strive to normalize the Paco2 because this will tend to reduce the metabolic compensation by the kidney. If the acid/base status of the patient re-equilibrates at a Paco 2 lower than the patient can maintain on his own, then weaning will be much more difficult. The supplemental oxygen should be titrated to maintain an adequate Pao 2 level of at least 60 Torr, but not so much that the ventilatory drive is suppressed. Flow rates on the machine should be adjusted to assure an adequate expiratory phase. If expiration of a breath is incomplete, a phenomenon known as dynamic hyperinflation occurs. The gas remaining in the chest at the end of a tidal volume breath gradually increases, leading to an increased functional residual volume. This is a disadvantage to the patient because ventilation takes place at a less-than-optimal point on the normal compliance curve, and the work of breathing is increased. 34 This group of patients, however, may actually require a small amount of resistance to expiration to maintain patency to their airways.30 The time spent on the ventilator should be kept as short as possible. The ventilator should be used to help the patient over the acute episode. Prolonged time on the ventilator leads to problems with muscular dyscoordination, risks of barotrauma, infection, alteration in normal acid/base equilibrium, and a general decline in overall status. When the patient is ready, aggressive efforts should be made to wean the patient. Slow weaning only prolongs the time on the ventilator and leads to complications.",
