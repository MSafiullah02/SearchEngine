One of the low-pathogenicity avian influenza viruses, H9N2, does not induce severe pathology in birds or humans compared to that induced by highly pathogenic viruses; however, it has been focused on for decades because of its economic damage in the poultry industry. Since it was first identified in 1966 [1], H9N2 has become endemic worldwide, especially in Asia and Africa. Some countries, including China, Republic of Korea, and Egypt, have adopted a vaccination scheme against H9N2 in their poultry farms [2]. However, H9N2 outbreaks have been continuously reported even in farm animals immunized against avian influenza [3], implying that the current vaccination strategy is in need of advancement for improved performance. This could be due to the antigenic shift and drift of viruses, weak antigenicity of current vaccines and/or inappropriate vaccination strategy in poultry farms [4].",

A large number of field studies have shown the positive effect of probiotics on growth performance or the immune system [5, 6]. In particular, Bacillus subtilis, a gram-positive bacterium, is a non-pathogenic species that has also been used as a probiotic for both animals and humans as feed [7] or health food [8], respectively. It is indeed classified as a generally regarded as safe microorganism by the Food and Drug Administration. B. subtilis is an endospore-forming bacterium that can differentiate into a form of dormant spores under harsh environmental conditions, including nutrient starvation and extreme thermal changes [9]. Sporulation initiates when DNA segregation is completed and concurrently with the asymmetric invagination of the membrane by forming a polar septum near one pole of the cell [10, 11]. Then, the immature spore stage (i.e., the forespore) is surrounded by a double membrane of the mother cell and develops into the mature spore [10].",

B. subtilis spores not only enhance innate immunity that protects against respiratory infections [12\u201314] but also induce an increase in antigen-specific antibody and T cell responses when co-administered with a soluble antigen [15\u201317]. B. subtilis spore-induced cross-presentation in response to a co-administered antigen suggests that the spore instructs diverse antigen-specific adaptive immune responses [15, 18]. Other reports also suggested that genetically modified B. subtilis spores displaying antigens on their surface can enhance antibacterial or antiviral immunity [16, 19\u201323]. An additional advantage of B. subtilis spores as adjuvants in influenza vaccines includes the enhanced effect of the vaccine and the reduced frequency of immunization required for the optimal immune response for full protection [24, 25]. A previous study demonstrated that B. subtilis spores could be a viable vaccine adjuvant against influenza in mice [13], with a reservation for safety and efficacy issues for further empirical investigation. Thus, we explored the ability of B. subtilis spores to influence the diversity of immune responses induced by inactivated H9N2 avian influenza virus in chickens. Specifically, we attempted to elucidate the mechanism for intrinsic induction of humoral and cell-mediated immune responses in chickens immunized with inactivated H9N2 and B. subtilis spores as adjuvants.",

Among them, we first examined the role of cytokines induced by B. subtilis spores. To test the role of cytokines from innate immune cells, we collected the supernatant from splenocytes or monocytes/macrophages stimulated with B. subtilis spores in vitro. CD3+ T cells from unimmunized chickens and labelled with CTV were treated with the supernatant and examined for proliferation [28]. TCR and co-stimulatory signalling was induced by using anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies together with the supernatant, as shown in the experimental scheme (Figure 4A). Flow cytometric analyses showed a strong CD4+ T cell proliferation when T cells treated with the supernatant from the B. subtilis spore-treated group (Figures 4B and C). Similar to total splenocytes, the supernatant from KUL01+ monocytes/macrophages stimulated with spores promoted CD4+ T cell proliferation (Figures 4B and C). In addition, CD8+ T cells cultured in the supernatant from B. subtilis spore-treated total splenocytes or monocytes/macrophages also showed high proliferative capacity regardless of the presence of H9N2 (Figures 4D and E). These results demonstrated that cytokines from innate cells induced by B. subtilis spores could further enhance the proliferation of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells.",

The elucidation of the action mechanism of adjuvants has contributed greatly to the development of the appropriate adjuvants in a rational approach to modern vaccine formulation [30, 31]. Although adjuvants have diverse activities [32], the exact role of each adjuvant has not yet been well clarified, especially in chickens. Oil adjuvant, one of the most commonly used adjuvants in domestic animal vaccines, is known to have safety and robust efficacy profiles, with antigen-specific antibodies induced against influenza viruses. It has also been applied to vaccines for low-pathogenicity avian influenza H9N2 vaccines for decades [33, 34]. However, H9N2 has not been conquered worldwide, and moreover, outbreaks have been reported in animals vaccinated against H9N2 infection. It has also been reported that oil adjuvants are not appropriate for inducing T cell responses, which are essential for memory T or B cell generation [35]; therefore, novel adjuvants and formulations of vaccine adjuvants are essential. In the present study, we demonstrated that B. subtilis spores could act as potential vaccine adjuvants that synergistically provide antigen-specific immune responses against the avian influenza virus H9N2 in White Leghorn chickens.",

These cytokines play a critical role not only in controlling and eliminating invading pathogens but also in provoking the activation of adaptive immune cells such as T cells, especially Th1 and Th17 differentiation [36, 37]. It has been suggested that high expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines upon B. subtilis spore treatment is associated with improved resistance to viral infection [12]. We showed that soluble factors such as cytokines from B. subtilis spore-treated innate immune cells can enhance the proliferation of T cells, suggesting the importance of cytokines from innate cells treated with spores that subsequently enhance antigen-specific adaptive immune responses. In the present study, upregulation of gene expression of B cell-related genes such as BAFF or CD40L in total splenocytes after B. subtilis spore treatment showed a positive correlation with increased B cell numbers. We also showed that the proliferation of CD8+ and CD4+ T cells was increased by B. subtilis spores, which deserves further research to validate and identify the cross-presentation of exogenous antigens in antigen-presenting cells followed by activation of antigen-specific CD8+ T cells. On the other hand, since there is no suitable model to examine antigen-specific immune responses in chickens, we need more sophisticated in vitro and in vivo models to evaluate antigen-specific B and T cell responses. Furthermore, antigen-specific T or B cell responses should also be analysed at the protein level or single-cell level using ELISA or intracellular staining and flow cytometry in subsequent studies.",

In particular, the induction of proper memory responses should be more important in laying hens and great grandparent stocks that generally stay alive for a longer period of time. The generation of memory responses is largely dependent on the activation of T cells, especially CD4+ helper T cells. Most vaccine studies performed in chickens have focused only on humoral responses, including antigen-specific or neutralizing antibody responses; however, the evaluation of T cell quality has been less studied. Our results showed that the commercial oil adjuvant vaccine could not induce a strong T cell response compared to that induced by H9N2 with the B. subtilis spore adjuvant. This result is in line with a previous study that demonstrating the ability of B. subtilis spores to increase the level of T cell responses [35]. As B. subtilis spores induced stronger recall responses than a commercial oil adjuvant-based vaccine, they may have advantages as adjuvants in terms of the generation of antigen-specific memory responses, which should be further investigated in chickens in the industrial field.",

It is important to note that the Spore + H9N2 group had much higher levels of Th1 and Th17 responses than the commercial oil vaccine group. Th1 immune responses are considered to be essentially required against viral infection. IL-17 is known to trigger autoimmune disease or anti-bacterial immune responses [38] but is also reported to have a role in anti-viral immune responses [39]. In the same context as our results, IL-6 and IL-1\u03b2 produced from innate immune cells, such as macrophages, have been reported to be required for IL-17 production. In addition, some studies have suggested that IL-1\u03b2 can induce both Th1 and Th17 responses [40, 41]. We focused on systemic immune responses, but tissue-specific immune responses have also been considered a primary target for protection against influenza infection. According to mouse studies [13], spore adjuvants could induce lung-specific immune responses when delivered as intranasal vaccines. Therefore, further studies with B. subtilis spore adjuvants should be performed not only as a mucosal adjuvant but also with challenge studies against highly pathogenic influenza while comparing with commercially available vaccine adjuvants.",
