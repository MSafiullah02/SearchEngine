            "text": "Recently, there has been increased interest in polyphenolic compounds found in natural foods. Several of these plant foods may have beneficial effects in humans (Ferrazzano et al., 2011). Most antioxidants isolated from plants are polyphenols, which exhibit biological activities such as antibacterial, antiviral, anti-allergic, anti-inflammatory, anticancer, and immunostimulant (Scalbert, Manach, Morand, & R\u00e9m\u00e9sy, 2005). The antioxidant activity of these compounds is due to their ability to stabilize or deactivate free radicals generated by a metabolic pathway within the body tissue, thereby reducing free radical-mediated degradation of cells and tissues in an organism (Staszewski, Pilosof, & Jagus, 2011). The main sources of the natural polyphenols in the daily human diet are tea, coffee, vegetables, legumes, whole-grain cereals, and fruits (Ferrazzano et al., 2011).",

Tea is one of the most popular beverages in the world because of its attractive aroma, taste, and healthy effects (Lin, Lin, Liang, Lin-Shiau, & Juan, 1998). Depending on the manufacturing process, tea is classified into three major types: \u2018non-fermented\u2019 green tea (produced by drying and steaming the fresh leaves which inactivate the polyphenol oxidase and thus, oxidation is prevented); \u2018semi-fermented\u2019 oolong tea (produced when the fresh leaves are subjected to partial fermentation before drying); and \u2018fermented\u2019 black tea and pu-erh tea which undergo a post-harvest fermentation stage before drying and steaming. The fermentation of black tea is due to oxidation catalyzed by polyphenol oxidase while in pu-erh tea, it is attained by using microorganisms (Bancirova, 2010). The differences between the various processes of manufacture result in differences in the polyphenolic profile among green, oolong, black, and pu-erh teas.

Catechins are rapidly eliminated, and galloylated catechins were never recovered in urine due to preferential excretion of these compounds in bile (Van et al., 2001). The low bioavailability of catechins may be perhaps because of relatively low concentration of circulating catechins in relation to ingested catechins or due to rapid degradation or uptake by other tissues (Yoda, Hu, Zhao, & Shimamura, 2004).",

Black tea was extracted for 2, 8, and 18 h with absolute acetone, dimethylformamide (DMF), ethanol, methanol, and their 50% aqueous solutions. Aqueous acetone or DMF extracts displayed the highest polyphenol contents and antioxidant activity, while absolute acetone was the least efficient solvent. S. aureus was found to be the most sensitive to all tea extracts, except for the methanol extract (Turkmen, Velioglu, Sari, & Polat, 2007). Similarly, Sari, Turkmen, Polat, and Velioglu (2007) screened the extracts of black tea with different solvents (acetone, DMF, ethanol, and methanol) for polyphenol content, and antioxidant, and antibacterial activities. It was found that methanol was the least efficient solvent for polyphenol extraction from black tea. All the extracts showed antioxidant activity by 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging assay. The black tea extracts had strong antimicrobial activity against selected bacteria, except for E. coli O157:H7 while S. aureus was found to be the most sensitive to all the extracts. E. coli was the most resistant among bacterial strains. However, the instability of polyphenols is attributable to their oxidation; the authors examined the effects of antioxidants and inhibitors of polyphenol oxidation on the maintenance of polyphenol antibacterial activity towards MRSA. It was found that the antibacterial activity of EGCG was enhanced in the presence of ascorbic acid, and ascorbic acid was the most effective for retaining the concentration of stable EGCG (Hatano et al., 2008). Furthermore, Hua, Peng, Zeng, Yao, and Qian (2010) reported sub-minimum inhibitory concentrations (sub-MICs) of various types of tea and the main components of tea against MRSA.

It was observed that attachment of EGCG was significantly lower to E. coli than S. aureus (Nakayama, Shigemune, Tsugukuni, Tokuda, & Miyamoto, 2011). Likewise, Liu et al.

More recently, Matsumoto et al. (2012) synthesized a series of new fatty acid esters of EGCG by lipase-catalyzed transesterification. These derivatives exhibited several-fold higher activities than EGCG, particularly against gram-positive organisms. Among the derivatives evaluated, sub-MICs of dioctanoate 1 and palmitate 2 (Fig. 5\n) for 17 strains of S. aureus were between 4 and 32 \u03bcg/mL, although MIC of EGCG for these 17 strains was \u2265 128 \u03bcg/mL. The enhanced activity of the palmitate derivative against S. aureus was supported by its increased membrane-permeabilizing activity. The palmitate derivative showed rapid bactericidal activity against MRSA ATCC43300 at \u2265 16 \u03bcg/mL. The finding suggested that the addition of long alkyl chains significantly enhanced the activity of EGCG against several bacteria, particularly against S. aureus and MRSA.",

The authors observed responses after exposure to tea polyphenols (TPP) like changes in cell-membrane fatty acids, presence of perforations, and irregular rod forms with wrinkled surfaces. During proteomic analysis, nine upregulated proteins were identified by exposure to TPP including chaperone protein HSP 60 and proteins involved in cellular defense mechanism, such as DNA gyrase subunit A, regulator ampC, RNA polymerase sigma factor, organic solvent tolerance protein, dihydrolipoamide acetyltransferase, superoxide dismutase, transcriptional regulator, and multidrug resistance protein K, whereas the expression of eight proteins was downregulated including chaperone protein HSP70, elongation factor EF-2, acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, enolase, succinate dehydrogenase/fumarate reductase, flavoprotein subunit, glycerophosphoryl diester phosphodiesterase, glutamate/aspartate transport system permease, and aromatic-amino acid aminotransferase. The above results indicated that E. coli cells stressed by exposure to TPP invest more energy in upregulating various defense mechanisms while simultaneously downregulating various metabolic and biosynthetic proteins, and provided relevant clues for understanding the mechanism of TPP-induced stress and cytotoxicity on E. coli. Furthermore, Lee et al. (2009) studied antipathogenic properties of green tea polyphenol EGCG at concentrations below the MIC (539 \u00b1 22 \u03bcg/mL) against enterohemorrhagic E. coli O157:H7. At 25 \u03bcg/mL, the growth rate was not affected, but autoinducer 2 concentration, biofilm formation, and swarm motility decreased to 13.2, 11.8, and 50%, respectively. The black tea polyphenols reduced the expression of virulence traits of clinical isolates of Shigella dysenteriae and enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC P2 1265) strains (Kiran et al., 2010). More recently, the antibacterial property and mechanism of a novel pu-erh tea nanofibrous membrane have been studied. In this study, pu-erh tea was used as a raw material for nanomaterial preparation and as an antibacterial agent. The results showed better antibacterial activity with smaller pu-erh tea powder (PTP) particles, the nano-sized particles had the best effects, and the MIC of nano-PTP (NPTP) was 13.5 mg/mL. Pu-erh tea in nanofibrous membranes damaged the E. coli cell membranes and caused leakage of potassium and enzymes (Su, Zhang, Wang, & Li, 2012).",

The fermentation of such carbohydrates by bacterial enzymes occurring in oral cavities provokes the formation of organic acids responsible to dental caries. Ooshima (2005) studied the anti-caries activity of various types of tea and their polyphenols. The fermentation process during processing of tea results in oxidation of simple polyphenols in green tea leaves to produce more complex structures due to polymerization.

Furthermore, Hassani et al.

The extracts were able to prevent the growth of oral Streptococci. A 1 mg/mL of black tea extract completely inhibited biofilm formation while green tea extract was unable to inhibit biofilm formation at the same concentration. The dry leaves of black tea contained more tannins than green tea and had stronger antibacterial activity (Stanczyk, Skolimowska, & Wedzisz, 2008).",

Podlipnik (2009) performed docking of selected natural polyphenols to ARF (ADP-ribosylation factor) activated A1 subunit of cholera toxin (CTA1). EGCG, TF3, and 1,2,3,6-tetra-O-galloyl-d-glucose were the best binder towards the active binding site of CTA1. Tea polyphenols have been also tested as antimicrobial drugs against food-borne pathogen and food-spoilage bacteria. In a study on major food-borne pathogens, Chinese green tea extract strongly inhibited these pathogens (E. coli O157:H7, S. Typhimurium DT104, L. monocytogenes, and S. aureus). A simple and efficient reversed-phase high-speed counter-current chromatography (HSCCC) method was developed for the separation and purification of four bioactive polyphenol compounds, ECG, EGCG, EC, and caffeine (CN). Among the four compounds, ECG and EGCG were the most active, particularly EGCG against S. aureus.

Several reports available in the literature have shown that tea polyphenols have a protective effect against HIV infection. The reports showed that green tea catechin, EGCG is the most effective compound against HIV infection. Hamza and Zhan (2006) reported a mechanism of inhibition of gp120\u2013CD4 binding by EGCG. The authors performed extensive molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulations, and binding free-energy calculation studies to predict the most favorable structures of CD4\u2013EGCG, gp120\u2013CD4, and gp120\u2013CD4\u2013EGCG binding complexes in water. The results revealed that EGCG binds with CD4 in such a way that the calculated binding affinity of gp120 with the CD4\u2013EGCG complex is negligible. Therefore, a favorable binding of EGCG with CD4 can effectively block gp120\u2013CD4 binding. Similarly, Williamson, McCormick, Nance, and Shearer (2006) demonstrated binding of EGCG to the CD4 molecules at the gp120 attachment site and inhibition of gp120 binding. Molecular modeling studies suggested a binding site for EGCG in the D1 domain of CD4, the pocket that binds gp120. A 0.2 \u03bcM/L EGCG inhibited binding of gp120 to isolated human CD4 + T cells. This clearly demonstrated clear evidence of high-affinity binding of EGCG to the CD4 molecules with a Kd of approximately 10 nM and inhibition of gp120 binding to human CD4 + T cells.",

Recently, Pei, Zhang, Xu, Chen, and Chen (2011) studied the role of pu-erh tea extract (PTE) against HBV by using a stably HBV-transfected cell line HepG2 2.2.15. MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay showed that PTE and its active components (tea polyphenols, theaflavins, and theanine) had a low cytotoxicity profile against HBV. More recently, four lipophilic ester derivatives of EGCG, namely EGCG-O-tetrastearate 10, EGCG-O-tetraeicosapentaenoate 11, EGCG-O-tetradocosahexaenoate 12, and EGCG-O-octabutyrate 13 (Fig. 9) were prepared and evaluated for their in vitro antioxidant and antiviral activities. Incorporation of long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), into EGCG resulted in increased peroxyl radical scavenging activity and metal chelation capacity. The EGCG\u2013PUFA esters were found to be 1700-fold more effective in inhibiting hepatitis C virus (HCV) protease than embelin which serves as a positive control. The derivatives were also found to be \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitors, suggesting their potential role as an anti-HIV agent (Zhong, Ma, & Shahidi, 2012).",

The in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated that green tea polyphenols were active against HSV while failing to show any activity against IFV (Daikoku et al., 2011). EGCG inactivates HSV-1 and HSV-2 at pH 8.0 by 3 log10 to 4 log10 but is ineffective at pH 5.7. Recently, Isaacs et al.

Dimers with one gallate moiety had antiviral activity intermediate between the activities of EGCG and digallate dimers.

            "text": "Combination of green tea polyphenols mainly ECG/EGCG and various antibiotics exhibited synergistic antibacterial effect against MRSA. Inhibition zones of penicillin, oxacillin, ampicillin, ceftazidime, ceftezole, minocycline, and tetracycline in combination with green tea against MRSA were larger than the single antibiotics (Hua, Peng, Zeng, et al., 2010). Recently, Cho, Oh, and Oh (2011) explored the synergistic antibacterial and proteomic effects of imipenem alone and in combination with EGCG on clinical isolates of imipenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (IRKP). The MIC of imipenem and EGCG for 12 clinical isolated IRKP strains ranged from 8\u201332 \u03bcg/mL and 300\u2013650 \u03bcg/mL, respectively. Each of the 12 IRKP strains experienced a 4- to 64-fold reduction in the MIC of imipenem upon co-incubation with 0.25 \u00d7 MIC level of EGCG. Compared to imipenem alone, combination of EGCG with imipenem demonstrated enhanced bactericidal activity. Two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis identified eight down-regulated proteins including proteins involved in energy metabolism (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and pyruvate kinase), biosynthesis, biosynthesis of cofactor, protein synthesis (elongation factor Tu, acetyl-coA carboxylase, molybdenum cofactor biosynthesis protein A, and 50S ribosomal protein L9), cell envelope (outer membrane protein) and DNA metabolism (single stranded DNA binding protein), and four up-regulated proteins including molecular chaperone DnaK, chaperonin GroEL, alkyl hydroperoxide reductase, and superoxide dismutase in the IRKP strain upon exposure to 1 \u00d7 MIC of EGCG. Analysis of the outer membrane protein profiles of IRKP cultures treated with EGCG revealed unique changes in outer membrane proteins. These outcomes demonstrated that sub-MIC exposure of EGCG dramatically affected the expression of several important IRKP proteins.",

(2005) observed that a combination of catechins with fluoroquinolone antibiotic ciprofloxacin acted synergistically to alleviate chronic bacterial prostatitis in rats. Hirasawa and Takada (2004) evaluated the susceptibility of C. albicans to green tea catechin and the synergism of the combination of catechin and antimycotics. The authors found that the combined treatment with 3.12\u201312.5 mg/L EGCG and amphotericin B 0.5 mg/L (below MIC) markedly decreased the growth of amphotericin B-resistant C. albicans. Likewise, the combined use of 12.5 mg/L EGCG and fluconazole 10\u201350 mg/L (below MIC) effectively inhibited the growth of fluconazole-resistant C. albicans by 98.5%\u201399.7%. These results indicated that EGCG enhanced the antifungal effect of amphotericin B or fluconazole against antimycotic-susceptible and -resistant C. albicans. The authors also reported synergistic effect with concomitant use of teavigo and amphotericin B, fluconazole, flucytosine, itraconazole, micafungin, or miconazole (Sugai et al., 2008).",

            "text": "In this review, we have discussed various studies exploring antimicrobial profile of different types of tea and their polyphenols. These findings could be attributed to direct action against bacteria, viruses, and fungi, as well as suppression of microbial virulence factors. However, the detailed mechanism of antimicrobial activity of tea polyphenols still remains to be explored. Based on literature, EGCG was found the most potent tea polyphenol against bacteria, viruses, and fungi. Gram-positive bacteria were more susceptible towards EGCG compare to gram-negative strains. EGCG derivatives possessing hydrophobic alkyl side chain exhibited greater potency against parent molecule (EGCG) because of increased membrane-permeability. Therefore, structural modifications could improve its activity. In addition, there is growing evidence that EGCG acts synergistically with various conventional antibiotics against multidrug-resistant microorganisms. However, the in vivo efficacy of EGCG appears hindered by limited absorption, presystemic metabolism, and non-specific binding with other biological macromolecules. Recently, a successful attempt was made to improve the bioavailability by nanoemulsification of green tea extract (Kim et al., 2012). The following findings therefore suggest that future investigations should be carried out to study their in vivo activity, toxicity, and bioavailability of tea polyphenols (specially EGCG) to determine the actual relevance in the treatment of human and animal infections.",
