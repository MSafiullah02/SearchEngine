In the simian retrovirus type-1 (SRV-1) a pseudoknot together with a heptanucleotide slippery sequence are responsible for programmed ribosomal frameshifting, a translational recoding mechanism used to control expression of the Gag-Pol polyprotein from overlapping gag and pol open reading frames. Here we present the three-dimensional structure of the SRV-1 pseudoknot determined by NMR. The structure has a classical H-type fold and forms a triple helix by interactions between loop 2 and the minor groove of stem 1 involving base-base and base-sugar interactions and a ribose zipper motif, not identi\u00aeed in pseudoknots so far. Further stabilization is provided by a stack of \u00aeve adenine bases and a uracil in loop 2, enforcing a cytidine to bulge. The two stems of the pseudoknot stack upon each other, demonstrating that a pseudoknot without an intercalated base at the junction can induce ef\u00aecient frameshifting. Results of mutagenesis data are explained in context with the present three-dimensional structure. The two base-pairs at the junction of stem 1 and 2 have a helical twist of approximately 49 , allowing proper alignment and close approach of the three different strands at the junction. In addition to the overwound junction the structure is somewhat kinked between stem 1 and 2, assisting the single adenosine in spanning the major groove of stem 2. Geometrical models are presented that reveal the importance of the magnitude of the helical twist at the junction in determining the overall architecture of classical pseudoknots, in particular related to the opening of the minor groove of stem 1 and the orientation of stem 2, which determines the number of loop 1 nucleotides that span its major groove.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}, {"text": "Abbreviations used: SRV-1, simian retrovirus type-1; NOE, nuclear Overhauser effect; NOESY, NOE spectroscopy, MMTV, mouse mammary tumour virus; IBV, infections bronchitis virus; HMQC, heteronuclear multiple-quantum correlation spectroscopy; TYMV, turnip yellow mosaic virus; BWYV, beet western yellow virus.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Simian retrovirus type-1 1 uses programmed \u00c01 ribosomal frameshifting as a mechanism for regulating translation of its polycistronic mRNA. The frameshift enables the ribosome to skip the stop codon in the 0 frame and to proceed protein synthesis until the \u00aerst stop codon in the \u00c01 frame is reached. After synthesis the polyprotein is processed by proteolysis resulting in the functional proteins pro, gag and pol. Programmed ribosomal frameshifting has not only been observed for retroviruses, but also in coronaviruses, 2 plant viruses, 3 yeast, 4,5 and bacterial systems . 6, 7 Two elements in the mRNA are responsible for ef\u00aecient ribosomal frameshifting, (i) a heptanucleotide sequence and (ii) a secondary structural element six to eight nucleotides downstream of this sequence, which in almost all cases is a pseudoknot. The heptanucleotide or so-called shifty sequence has an X XXY YYZ consensus, where X can be any base, Y is A or U and Z is A, U or C. It is thought that when this sequence enters the A and P site of the ribosome, the pseudoknot structure causes pausing of the ribosome, giving time to shift to the \u00c01 reading frame. Although in most cases a pseudoknot is found to be responsible for ribosomal frameshifting, also a hairpin structure in HIV 8 and Escherichia coli dnaX 9,10 and a three-way junction in IS911 11 have been shown to be functionally active. Whether the pseudoknot structure acts as an independent unit, regulating the ribosomal frameshift by its structure or stability, or acts in concert with auxiliary proteins is still not understood. The importance of its structural identity is evident, however, since pseudoknots can for instance not be replaced by a functionally different pseudoknot 12 or replaced by a hairpin with a similar base-pair composition. 13 The pseudoknot of SRV-1 RNA is of the classical H-type, 14 \u00b1 16 with two stacked stems S1 and S2, connected by two loops L1 and L2. Mutational analysis of the pseudoknot in the overlapping region of the gag and pol genes of SRV-1 showed that the lengths of L1 and L2 and composition of the base-pairs in S1 are important for its function. 17, 18 In the SRV-1 18 and other frameshifting pseudoknots 19 changing L2 nucleotides close to the junction can have drastic effects on frameshift ef\u00aeciency.

In fact, variation of the distance between two consecutive phosphorous atoms in the same strand is only possible within small margins. In nucleic acid structures this is re\u00afected in the pre-sence of almost constant phosphorous-phosphorous distances. 44 This means that in reality the rotation axis has to be moved close to the cylinder wall. Then rotation of the upper part of the helix will leave the orientation of its helix axis unaltered with respect to the same rotation in the situation above. However, this rotation will now result in a shift of the helical centre of the upper with respect to that of the lower helix in the intersecting plane. This is illustrated in Figure 8(b) , where the effect of overwinding to a helical twist of 49 and 90 in the SRV-1 and BWYV pseudoknot, respectively, is compared with the situation in a normal A-type helix. In Figure 8 Solution Structure of the SRV-1 RNA Pseudoknot A-type helix by seven base-pairs brings, in this two-dimensional projection, the 5 H terminus of the upper stem, indicated by the little sphere attached to the upper base-pair, close to the 3 H terminus of the lower stem, indicated by the little sphere attached to the black base-pair.

In the SRV-1 pseudoknot the twist angle between the upper base-pair of the lower helix (stem S1) and the lowest base-pair in the upper helix (stem S2) amounts to 49 , giving rise to a shift of the helix centre of the upper helix, as can be seen from the shift of the upper helix with respect to that of the lower helix. Note that the rotation is around the pivot point P located at the crossing of the two circumferences, leaving the distance of the consecutive phosphorous atoms of the upper base-pair of stem S1 and the lowest base-pair of stem S2 virtually unaltered. A build up of the upper helix by six base-pairs brings its 5 H terminus as close to the 3 H terminus of the lower stem as the similar build up by seven base-pairs in the A-type helix. This clearly underscores the proposition that increasing the twist angle shortens the distance between the two termini in nice correspondence with the results depicted in Figure 7 (b). The effect is even more dramatic in the BWYV pseudoknot.

The absence of interactions between the single L1 residue A7 and the major groove of S2 strongly suggests that neither the identity of the crossing nucleotide nor the base-pair composition of S2 is important for frameshifting. This fully agrees with the various SRV-1 pseudoknots mutated in this region, that only show slight changes in frameshift ef\u00aeciencies (Figure 9 ). 18 The only known exception, i.e. a drop of 13 % upon changing two G-C pairs into A-U pairs, supports the notion that base-pair composition of S2 is not important provided that stability is maintained. The intricate interactions at the S1-S2 junction and at the L2-S1 interface suggest that in this part of the pseudoknot the nucleotide composition is much more important. Again this concurs with the various mutational studies performed. The wild-type sequence at the 3 H -side of L2, CUUA, is apparently suboptimal in terms of ef\u00aeciency, since deletion of two (CU) or three (GCU) residues from L2 was shown to increase frameshift ef\u00aeciency to a level of 34 % and 30 %, respectively. 18 This suggests that the interactions at the L2-S1 interface, i.e. base stacking, base-triples and the ribose zipper motif, are probably important elements in the mechanism of ribosomal frameshifting.

When AG, which does not show direct contacts with S1, was deleted from the loop, frameshift ef\u00aeciency was slightly less (21 %) than the wild-type level (23 %). In the case of deletion of CU, a guanosine is left between A26 and U27. Here the higher frameshift ef\u00aeciency might be due to additional stacking interactions of the guanosine between A26 and U27 and a triple interaction with one of the base-pairs in S1. Further shortening of L2 progressively diminishes frameshift ef\u00aeciency, which can be the result of disruption of the prime interactions at the junction by tension of a too short L2. When a block of three base-pairs in S1 is inverted, the frameshifting ef\u00aeciency drops to 10 %, 17 which can be attributed to the loss of two triple interactions. For our NMR studies we introduced a single base-pair inversion at G2-C18. In the NMR structure the sharp turn of L2 at the base of S1 is held by a hydrogen bond between the N1 and the amino proton of A21 and the amino proton of G18 and the O2 of C2, respectively.

Alternatively, the changes in frameshift ef\u00aeciency upon deletion or insertion of nucleotides in L2 could possibly arise from an optimization of the loop length as well as of the adenine content. A similar result has been observed in BWYV, where the insertion of an adenine residue after the \u00aerst residue in L2 (G19A19a) increased frameshift ef\u00aeciency by 70 %. 45 It would be interesting to investigate the effect on the L2 backbone conformation and frameshift ef\u00aeciency following replacement of adenine 28 by a pyrimidine.

NOE cross-peak volumes involving nonexchangeable protons from the 100 ms NOESY were converted into distance restraints using the approach as described by Barsukov and Lian, 59 which qualitatively takes care of spin diffusion, by using the H5-H6 NOEs (2.45 A \u00ca ) for short and intraresidue H1 H -H6/H8 NOEs of helical residues for longer distances (3.65 A \u00ca on average) for those cross-peaks that were only visible at longer mixing times. By this method, the distances that are derived from the 100 ms spectrum agree very well with those from longer mixing times, and the possibility of large errors exceeding the error bandwidth can be virtually excluded. Initially we made use of AE20 % error bounds for distances derived from the 100 ms NOESY experiment, because in our experience this gives a higher convergence rate, while the number of violations is kept to a minimum. Additional tests, using larger (\u00c030 %/ 40 %) error bounds resulted in structures with virtually identical overall and local folds, albeit with slightly larger overall rmsds (1.84 A \u00ca ) and number of violations. Small NOEs taken from the 300 ms 3D NOESY-HMQC were subdivided in four classes strong (1.8-3.0 A \u00ca ), medium (2.0-4.0 A \u00ca ), and weak (3.0-5.0 A \u00ca ). Small NOEs from the 200 ms NOESY were classi\u00aeed as very weak (4.0-6.0 A \u00ca ). As spin diffusion might become important for a molecule of this size, the upper bound for very weak NOEs was set to 6 A \u00ca , which is a rather conservative estimate. Distance bounds for partially overlapping peaks were set to 1.8-6.0 A \u00ca . Non-NOEs (i.e. lower bounds of 4.5-5 A \u00ca between a given proton pair) were put in at later stages of the structure calculations when the distance between a given proton pair came out smaller than 5 A \u00ca , while there was clearly no cross-peak visible in any of the NOE spectra. The given lower bound is very conservative, and had no in\u00afuence on the calculated structures, but merely helps de\u00aening the allowed conformational space during the molecular dynamics runs. Non-NOEs were only included for residues for which we established separately that they are not involved in intermediate exchange. Scalar couplings between H1 H and H2 H were determined from a DQF-COSY and a NOESY experiment, and were converted to N-or S-type sugar puckers (using dihedral restraints) in case of small (<3 Hz) or high (>7 Hz) values, respectively. The sugar puckers of A21, A22, A23, C24 and C36 were left unrestrained because intermediate scalar couplings of 4-6 Hz were measured for these residues. All residues had intra residual H1 H /H2 H /H3 H to H6/H8 NOE intensities that are indicative of an (-angle in the anti range, except for C24 and were therefore restrained 202(AE30) for the stem residues and 202(AE60) for the others.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 306, "end": 324, "text": "Barsukov and Lian,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 325, "end": 327, "text": "59", "ref_id": "BIBREF61"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Structural restraints"}, {"text": "Both stem regions adopt an A-helical conformation, evidenced by chemical shifts, sugar puckers and NOE connectivities.

Distances relating to imino protons were conservatively estimated from a 300 ms NOESY spectrum. Hydrogen bond restraints, according to Saenger 60 with error bounds of 0.1 A \u00ca , and planarity restraints were imposed for residues involved in Watson-Crick base-pairing, as evidenced by the imino proton spectra and all observed NOEs and chemical shifts. Hydrogen bond restraints for the two junctional base-pairs were loosened (i.e. error bounds were increased to 0.5 A \u00ca ) in order obtain a more unbiased result in this region of the RNA molecule.
