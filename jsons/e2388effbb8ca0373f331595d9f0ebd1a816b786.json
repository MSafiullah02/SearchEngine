Hospitals are randomized into intervention or control group. In intervention group, hospitals receive the concept of appropriate in-hospital thromboprophylaxis plus a multifaceted QI which encompasses four components: (1) an electronic alert combining computer-based clinical decision support system and electronic reminders, (2) appropriate prophylaxis based on dynamic VTE and bleeding risk assessments, (3) periodical audit and interactive feedback on performance, (4) strengthened training and patient education. In control, hospitals receive the concept of recommended prophylaxis alone without QI. Thromboprophylaxis will be at the discretion of hospitals and conducted as usual. With a final sample size of 5760 hospitalized patients in 32 hospitals on mainland China, this trial will examine the effect of QI on improvement in thromboprophylaxis and patient-centered outcomes. This is an open-label trial that patients and healthcare professionals will know group allocation after enrollment, but endpoint adjudicators and statisticians will be blinded.

If patients are at risk of VTE and have bleeding risk factors (eg, recent bleed, thrombocytopenia, active bleeding) 16 , mechanical intervention, eg. graduated compression stockings, J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 11 / 40 intermittent pneumatic compression, and venous foot pumps, is the appropriate prophylaxis approach. It is an alternative for patients contraindicative to anticoagulant prophylaxis, the use of which could lead to bleeding and safety events. If patients have low bleeding risk, pharmacological prophylaxis is preferred over mechanical ones. Overall, both thrombosis and bleeding risk assessments are recommended for an optimal decision-making in clinic practice. Thromboprophylaxis approaches may need adjustment accordingly due to patients' changing risk during hospital stay ( Figure 2 , Figure 3 ).",

The pragmatic design increases generalizability of Meanwhile, there are several inherent limitations in this study. First, this is a cluster randomization trial with hospitals being randomized as clusters. Hospital randomization occurs before patient enrollment, making allocation concealment difficult. Selection bias may arise when unblinded recruiters don't enroll patients because their hospitals are not allocated to the group they expect to be in, which may also lead to hospital withdrawal 30 . In addition, consent bias could be induced by patients who have been informed of or get known the group allocation before enrollment 28, 30 . To minimize these bias inherent in methodology, informed consent needs to be handled differently from traditional randomized trials, in which randomization and intervention are administered at individual level. We will obtain well-informed written consent from hospital directors and agree to provide QI intervention to hospitals in control group after completion of the study. In patient enrollment phase, information on group allocation will not be provided to patients until they are enrolled. A blinded recruiter unaware of hospital allocation will recruit patients independently.

Similarly, HA-VTE occurs in 0.3% Chinese inpatients 4 . Albeit the VTE risk in hospital, thromboprophylaxis was pervasively underused and less than 15% Chinese patients receive prophylactic interventions after admission. Moreover, VTE hospitalization rate among Chinese population keeps rising over recent years, which has been up to 15.8/100 000 in 2016 5 . The increasing VTE hospitalization and substantial room for improvement in thromboprophylaxis underscore the necessity of effective thromboprophylaxis to prevent VTE. Based on newly updated guidelines, existing clinical evidence and institution regulations 6-11 , China Venous Thromboembolism Study Group has issued several thromboprophylaxis guidelines 12-14 and strongly advocate appropriate in-hospital thromboprophylaxis, including VTE risk assessment for each admitted patient by the interventions. Some basic interventions are also recommended, e.g., patient education on VTE and encouragement of early mobilization. Despite this, there still exists a large gap between clinical practice and the recommended care. In the VTE prophylaxis survey among 6,986 surgical and 6,623 medical inpatients, only 14.3% received prophylaxis and 10.3% underwent appropriate prophylactic interventions 4 . The dearth of enforcement makes VTE one of high priority unsolved clinical problems.",
