Tropical sprue has been identified most readily in Asia and the Caribbean islands, and there are isolated areas of particular risk within both hemispheres. Sprue is relatively common in the indigenous populations of Puerto Rico, Haiti, the Dominican Republic, and Cuba, but it is not seen in the rest of the Caribbean islands and is no longer recognized in Barbados.3, 4 It is seen in northern South America, Venezuela, and Colombia but rarely in Central America or Mexico. It is less common than previously but remains on the Indian subcontinent, from the Himalayas to the south, and it has been recognized in Myanmar and the Philippines.5, 6, 7 Infrequent cases of tropical sprue were documented in Africa until the 1970s; cases have been recognized in Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) and South Africa, and tropical sprue has developed in expatriates living in Nigeria.8 There may be endemic foci of tropical sprue in the Middle East as well, with a spruelike illness recognized in Turkey.",

Children are thought to be relatively spared, although disease has been documented in all age groups. Very young children have not been found to have tropical sprue; this may represent a beneficial effect of breast-feeding. In studies of family outbreaks of tropical sprue in South India, even older children developed disease at a significantly lower rate than adults.9 The reason for this is not clear. Persistent diarrhea develops in children more commonly in parts of the world where the environment is contaminated more heavily with potentially disease-causing microorganisms.10 Tropical sprue may be one of the causes of prolonged diarrhea and wasting in this age group as well, but studies such as small bowel intubation and cultures or biopsy have shown conflicting results regarding the correlation of small bowel colonization with persistent diarrhea.",

A seasonal variation also has been documented in the rate of occurrence of tropical sprue in the indigenous population of Puerto Rico.4 This seasonal variation also lends credence to the possibility of an underlying infectious cause.",

Tropical sprue was originally recognized in expatriates and British colonists in India in the early 19th century and subsequently in the Dutch in Java, the French in Indochina, and Americans in the Philippines, Vietnam, and Puerto Rico. Tropical sprue or malabsorption with jejunitis (tropical enteropathy) has been described in Peace Corps volunteers and has occurred sporadically in travelers.11 Generally, tropical sprue develops in an expatriate who has lived for a prolonged time (6 months to 1 year) in an endemic area. Rare cases also have been described in short-term travelers. Tropical sprue is also recognized in immigrants who leave endemic areas, although they may not complain of gastrointestinal symptoms until they have been out of the endemic area for a prolonged period.12 These exposure data also suggest an infectious origin for tropical sprue.",

Streptococci, staphylococci, and lactobacilli are among the common isolates, and these are present in small numbers. In the distal small bowel, the cecum, and the colon, anaerobes and facultative gram-negative organisms predominate in normal persons. Small bowel cultures from travelers with tropical sprue show increased numbers of gram-negative rods, including Alcaligenes, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Hafnia spp. In small bowel cultures from persons with tropical sprue who were native to India, Haiti, or Puerto Rico, Klebsiella, Escherichia coli, and Enterobacter cloacae were the most common organisms. Carefully done studies in South Africa and India documented similar organisms in similar concentrations in the small bowel of asymptomatic control patients and in patients with tropical sprue, suggesting that environmental contamination may predispose to increased small bowel flora.11, 15, 16 In another series of patients from India, the number of organisms found in the small bowel of tropical sprue patients was the same as that found in the small bowel of healthy controls, but the type of organisms isolated varied.15 Other organisms, especially Enterobacter and Veillonella, were isolated more frequently from the small bowel of patients with tropical sprue than from healthy controls.17 Demonstration of organisms does not prove cause and effect, however.",

E. coli and Klebsiella isolated from Indian patients with tropical sprue were not found to produce heat-stable or heat-labile enterotoxins when tested.18 Some animal studies have suggested that small bowel overgrowth by colonizing nontoxigenic E. coli can produce a secretory diarrheal syndrome if the level of colonization reaches a high enough concentration within the small bowel.",

The presence of bacteria in the small bowel may potentiate the symptoms caused by the small bowel parasite Giardia lamblia, and the interaction of small bowel bacteria and parasites has been considered as a possible cause of tropical sprue.22 Infection with hookworm or Strongyloides stercoralis has also been discussed as a possible cause for tropical sprue. Reports of tropical sprue occurring in the presence of orthomyxovirus or coronavirus particles in the stool have also appeared in the literature. Cases of tropical sprue have been reported after an intestinal infection with fungus or the blue-green algae Prototheca. Although the traditional definition of tropical sprue excludes patients with diarrhea on the basis of recognized pathogens, it is possible that improvements in diagnostic techniques would permit the identification of organisms that are or have been associated with tropical sprue but previously were not able to be isolated or identified. Whether tropical sprue is distinct from tropical or environmental enteropathy has never been clear; these syndromes may exist at the ends of the spectrum of a single disease, with sprue being the more advanced and symptomatic form of the more frequently asymptomatic environmental enteropathy.1 Sequence-based microbial identification is an example of a significantly more sensitive technique that may be beneficial in elucidating intestinal microbiota as it contributes to the pathogenesis of tropical sprue and may clarify the relationship to environmental enteropathy.1, 23\n",

Similar to the permissive effect of protein ingestion in the pathogenesis of pig-bel, the intake of long-chain fatty acids has been studied as a potential causative factor for tropical sprue.29 The seasonal epidemic occurrence of tropical sprue in Puerto Rico immediately follows a traditional holiday feast of pork, which is rich in long-chain fatty acids.30 There are several mechanisms whereby these long-chain fatty acids might contribute to the production of clinical tropical sprue. Long-chain fatty acids can alter intestinal motility and delay intestinal transit time. Plasma levels of enteroglucagon and motilin are increased significantly in patients with tropical sprue; motilin slows gastric emptying, and enteroglucagon slows intestinal transit.31 Recent studies have also demonstrated abnormalities in PYY and neurotensin after infusion of fat in some patients with sprue, which may contribute to altered motility and bacterial overgrowth.32 Intubation studies have shown that intestinal infusions of fat increase plasma enteroglucagon levels and decrease intestinal motor activity. Fat within the gut lumen also inhibits the mucosal sodium-potassium fluxes and the magnesium adenosine triphosphatases, which can contribute to malabsorption of water and electrolytes in the intestine and raise the pH of the mucosal microenvironment.29, 33\n",

Enhanced magnification endoscopy (EME) has been shown to be more sensitive in detecting villus atrophy than standard endoscopy and may assist in making a noninvasive diagnosis of sprue. In a study of 15 patients diagnosed with sprue by intestinal biopsy in Caracas, Venezuela, atrophy was demonstrated in 93% of patients by EME, whereas standard endoscopy was able to detect atrophy in only 20% of patients.53 Documentation of abnormal transit time by small bowel follow-through or breath hydrogen testing, which also can imply bacterial overgrowth, suggests but is not diagnostic of tropical sprue. The differential diagnosis that must be considered in a patient with chronic diarrhea, weight loss, and malabsorption, even in a clinical setting consistent with tropical sprue, should include giardiasis, cryptosporidiosis, coccidiosis (Cystoisospora belli), capillariasis, strongyloidiasis, celiac sprue (gluten enteropathy), lymphoma, intestinal tuberculosis, blind loop syndrome, pancreatic tumors, Whipple's disease, and microsporidia-associated HIV enteropathy. If diagnosis remains obscure, biopsy is considered to be very sensitive and will allow the syndromes to be clearly differentiated. Celiac disease, or gluten enteropathy, can be more definitively diagnosed by sending antigliadin or antiendomysial antibodies.",

Even with prolonged therapy, relapses have been seen in this population, although these may have been caused by reexposure to an infecting organism and represent recurrent rather than relapsing disease.56 Reports have suggested that tropical sprue in the Caribbean is more amenable to therapy than sprue in India, but these studies are difficult to compare.57 Poorly absorbed sulfa drugs are an acceptable alternative to tetracycline in children or pregnant women.58 A favorable symptomatic response to therapy with folate and antibiotics can provide additional evidence that tropical sprue was the cause of chronic diarrhea and malabsorption in a patient; however, even this is not specific because bacterial overgrowth in a blind loop syndrome would also be expected to respond.
