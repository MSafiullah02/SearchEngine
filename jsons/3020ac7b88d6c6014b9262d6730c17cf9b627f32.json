The patient received erythromycin orally; however, the pustule increased in size and the patient developed fever and a 2 x 4 cm red and tender submandibular lymph node, which prompted admission. Initially the patient was treated with methicillin parenterally, but the pustule and lymphadenopathy worsened and an incision and drainage was performed after three days. After 72 hours of incubation on the blood agar plate, Nocardia brasiliensis was isolated from the small amount of purulent material obtained at surgery. A culture of the pustule was reported as having no growth on blood agar after 48 hours. The patient was treated with trimethoprim/ sulfamethoxazole' orally with resolution of the pustule and lymphadenopathy. Quantitative immunoglobulin values were within the normal range. Patient 2, a 5-year-old Caucasian boy, first developed an erythematous papule on his left cheek. Five days later he was given cephalexin orally after the lesion was cultured. The following day methicillin was given intramuscularly, but he developed a 3 \u2022 3 cm tender left submandibular node and fever, and was hospitalized and given methicillin intravenously. His lymphadenopathy increased despite therapy. The culture of the cheek lesion grew Noeardia brasiliensis after 72 hours of incubation on blood agar. The patient received trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole by mouth for four weeks and the submandibular lymph node enlargement resolved. The skin lesion on the cheek gradually improved after one month of therapy. Patient 3, a 3-year-old Oriental girl, developed progressive swelling in the left subrnandibular area followed by a small draining pustule on the left naris. The following day she developed fever and was treated with penicillin, Because there was no response to treatment, she was hospitalized. A Gram stain 0022-3476/81/100593 + 03500.30/0 9 1981 The C. V. t~osby Co. of material from the nasal pustule and from an aspirate from the lymph node showed beaded, gram-positive, filamentous branching rods. Both cultures grew Nocardia caviae. She was treated for three months with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole by mouth and her skin lesion and lymphadenopathy resolved.",

Common etiologies for cervical lymphadenitis in children include Staphylococcus aureus, Group A streptococci, and atypical mycobacteria. The presence of a pustule in association with cervical lymphadenitis suggests other potential etiologies as well, including tularemia, plague (Yersinia pestis), cutaneous diphtheria, cat scratch disease, cervicofacial actinomycosis, and sporotrichosis.",

N. asteroides isolates were associated with pulmonary, systemic, or primary central nervous system infections, whereas more than 50% of the N. brasiliensis isolates were from skin or soft tissue infection. N. brasiliensis can be associated with mycetomas, abscesses, pustules, and cutaneous abscesses, and over 90% of cutaneous disease with lymphatic involvement of an extremity in adults (\"sporotrichoid\" lymphocutaneous syndrome ~) has involved this species. Nocardial isolates were speciated by the Houston City Health Department? ~ N. brasiliensis was isolated from two of the three children reported here with the cervicofacial syndrome and from one of the two previously reported cases in the literature, thus supporting the observation that N. brasiliensis is the most common Nocardia sp. involving the skin, especially when lymph node involvement also is present.",

During that time 20 cases of primary cutaneous nocardiosis were identified. Three of these were in children and these were the only cases that involved the face. During the same time period only two children were seen with pulmonary nocardia infection (R. J. Wallace, Jr., M.D., personal communication). A review of cutaneous isolates of Nocardia reported to the State Health Laboratory in Austin, Texas, over a three-year period revealed 24 additional cases of primary cutaneous disease, of which three were in children. Two of these involved the extremities; the third involved the face. As had been noted with the cases from Houston, none of the adult patients had cervicofacial involvement.

Although a history of trauma was not found in our patients (as it has been with most cases reported in adults), the isolation ofNocardia sp. from both pustule and regional lymph nodes suggests that the organism was introduced into the skin from the environment and involved the regional lymph nodes via lymphatic spread. The frequent involvement of the nose and cheek as the primary site of involvement in children but not in adults is unexplained. Perhaps the playing habits of children, contamination with soil, and the blood and lymphatic supply of this area contribute to this characteristic clinical picture.",
