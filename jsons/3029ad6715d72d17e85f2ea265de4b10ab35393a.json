To this end, a Scopus search was made for papers containing the fragment \"Spanish financial crisis\" on their tittles, abstracts, or keywords, which ensued a sample of 632 studies. Findings show that the Spanish financial crisis worries the general population as well as scholars. Peaks in searches by general internet users take place in the years preceding the crisis (2004 and 2005) as well as throughout its duration (",

This led to the inflation of assets' prices, especially real state, which came to be known as the real estate bubble (Garc\u00eda 2005) .",

The instability in the construction industry led to high rates of indebtedness, which soon affected the country's whole economy. An excessive amount of money was being loaned to an industry that was no longer profitable. In this context, banks were increasingly uncertain about whether the debts would be liquidated. Moreover, productivity problems tend to lead to future economic issues. In the years preceding the crisis, Spain's GDP grew more than that of the United Kingdom and the United States (EU-KLEM 2013) . This was already a sign that something was not right, or that, at the very least, the situation was temporary and unrealistic. A significant part of this growth was caused by the construction industry, which was responsible for 25% of the country's economic growth between 2000 and 2007. As Garc\u00eda (2005) points out, this was caused by the increase in working hours and the intensive use of technological capital.",

Naturally, the health crisis currently being faced by the whole world due to the outbreak of COVID-19 is an even bigger problem, which is expected to have catastrophic consequences for many countries' economies, including Spain. In this context, it is important to observe that the present research does not consider such phenomenon, which started after the data collection and analysis period. Regarding the methodological steps carried out as part of this investigation, first the extant literature on the Spanish financial crisis was systematically reviewed, which allowed the authors to understand the factors that led to this situation. Then, to achieve this paper's objective, the interest of the general population was assessed through the analysis of Google searches on the subject throughout the selected timeframe (2007) (2008) (2009) (2010) (2011) (2012) (2013) (2014) (2015) (2016) (2017) (2018) (2019) .

This condition, however, was interrupted in 2007, when the country started facing a severe economic recession. Although the global economic crisis significantly contributed to this deceleration, domestic imbalances have also played an important role. In this context, 2007 is arguably the year when the financial crisis reached Spain, along with many other European countries.",

In other words, during this time, it was particularly easy to convert any financial asset into money with minimal loss. This is shown by the increase in monetary aggregates (Adrian and Shin 2008) noticed in this period, which led to an overcapacity of the financial system. This, in turn, led to a general state of distrust, in which neither employers nor families were willing to not take credit. The only cases in which credit was taken were those when people needed to renew their debts or cover their losses. Naturally, as capitalist economies are based on credit, such situation would necessarily have a negative impact on the country's economy.",

On the other hand, if prices remained stable, one could simply stop paying the mortgage and lose the purchase option. In this case, the deal would effectively become a regular rent.

In such a deal, if one does not liquidate the debt, they must give back the house. Nevertheless, the general belief was that there was an incredibly low chance of decrease in prices, which encouraged many families to buy houses anyway (Garc\u00eda-Montalvo 2006) . There was a whole chain of factors that encouraged this model of purchase. For example, bank workers needed to sell mortgages in order to hit sales targets and gain bonuses. Therefore, they lowered the criteria for granting this type of loan (Montalvo 2014) . Moreover, all this housing construction and urbanisation methods did not take place in an institutional void (Garc\u00eda 2010) . Part of the problem was exactly the lack of spatial planning. More precisely, as observed by Maldonado and P\u00e9rez (2008) , specific plans for urban development either did not exist or were totally disregarded.",

Qualitative content analysis is a method for analyzing text data and delve into their meaning by following systematic procedures (Schreier 2012) . The term includes a series of different techniques to analyse texts (Powers et al. 2010 ). More specifically, content analysis serves to \"identify, analyse and inform patterns within the data\" (Braun and Clarke 2006 p. 79) . It includes the codification and classification of textual units, which makes it very useful to explore big volumes of textual information and determine tendencies, patterns within the words employed, as well as relationships between their meanings (Gbrich 2007) . Qualitative analysis methods are not only a useful tool for generating knowledge, but also an effective vehicle for presenting and addressing meanings and findings (Holloway and Todres 2005; Sandelowski 2010 ). To assure these methods' validities, researchers must clearly explain how the results were achieved (Schreier 2012 ). In the case of content analysis, the preparation phase starts with the definition of the unit of analysis (Guthrie et al. 2004) , to which researches must consider what they want to analyse (Cavanagh 1997) .",

Naturally, the goal of the present study was not verifying any previously proposed hypothesis about the interest of academics in the Spanish financial crisis, but simply exploring the trends and patterns in such interest through the analysis of published researches. Therefore, within this investigation, the content analysis serves the heuristic function, as it enriches the exploratory attempt, increasing the likeliness of discovery. Moreover, within the available content analysis techniques, the one adopted in the present study was the categorical content analysis, which consists in dismembering text units, or categories, according to pre-established criteria. In this context, the chosen Total 632 studies registry of unit was the word-rather than the theme-which facilitated the systematic analysis of a big volume of texts. Moreover, the main enumeration rule for coding, as it considers that the registry unit's relevance increases with its frequency of appearance.

Results show that although the crisis took place over a decade ago, back in 2007/2008, it still attracts significant academic interest. Moreover, this interest comes from different research areas, as the mentioned authors investigate areas as distinct as the public sector, the banking sector, the construction industry, and the tourism industry. The concepts analysed within those studies include inefficiency, financial sustainability, and all the effects of the economic and financial crisis worldwide, in the euro zone, and especially in Spain.",

Therefore, the situation initiated in 2007 has led to a significant drop in productivity. The country's economic situation had a great impact on the sector. On the other hand, part of the studies analysed focus on the public sector. These studies emphasize the need for financial transparency, especially on official websites. The solvency problems, risk premiums, and bank loans brought about by the financial crisis ultimately affected local governments, which must deal with the consequent increase in levels of (public) debt. The banking sector is also one of the most affected by the economic situation. One of the biggest problems for the sector is the risk of loyalty loss and abandonment by its clients.",

Studies also examined the opposite effect, that is, how tourism development affects the crisis, specially through the sale of vacation houses, which ultimately affects the construction industry.",

These circumstances included the contrast between countries with extreme deficits in their commercial balances and those enjoying atypical surplus values. In Europe, one of the countries that suffered the most as a result of the crisis was Spain. In the years preceding the beginning of the crisis, the country experienced several favourable economic circumstances, such as a higher GDP growth than that of global leaders, i.e., the United States, which eventually proved to be an illusion. In 2007, the economic boom came to an end, following the solvency crisis in the banking system and the decrease in the demand for products and services, especially houses. In this context, the construction industry was one of the most affected, and arguably one of the main factors responsible for amplifying the crisis effects in the country (due to the real estate bubble).",
