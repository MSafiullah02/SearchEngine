A progressive transition to consolidation, together with pleural effusion, extensive small lung nodules, irregular interlobular or septal thickening, and adenopathies, characterise the more advanced phase of the disease. 8, 9 These radiological manifestations can overlap with CT findings that are often found in patients with lung cancer upon disease progression or onset of concomitant pneumonia due to overlapping opportunistic infections. Regarding clinical manifestations, the worsening of pulmonary symptoms during lung cancer progression can be similar to that typical of COVID-19, adding further complexity to the thorough assessment of the course of disease in lung cancer patients. Together, these similarities can pose a major challenge to clinicians in distinguishing lung cancer evolution from a potential COVID-19 super-infection on the basis of radiological and clinical evidence, and, importantly, these specific conditions require very different therapeutic approaches.",

            "text": "Adding further complexity to this scenario, pneumonitis can also be induced by immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy, an effective and widely used standardof-care treatment for lung cancer in various treatment lines and settings. 10 Immune checkpoint inhibitorrelated pneumonitis has been reported in about 2% of cancer patients, 11 with a seemingly higher incidence in patients with lung cancer. 12 Dr P Marazzi/SPL pain, dyspnoea, and fever. Additionally, CT assessment of immune checkpoint inhibitor-related pneumonitis shows radiological findings similar to those typical of COVID-19-induced pneumonia (figure), thus hindering discrimination between the two clinical entities. Similarly, tyrosine kinase inhibitors can induce radiological patterns of interstitial-like pneumonitis, which develops in 4% of patients with epidermal growth factor receptor-mutant lung cancer treated with osimertinib. 13 In this scenario, standard chemotherapy does not seem to represent a suitable or potentially safer alternative to immune checkpoint inhibitor therapyneither for treating physicians who want to avoid the overlapping immune checkpoint inhibitor-related and COVID-19-related radiological and clinical changes, or for patients who are unsuitable for immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy. First, combinations of chemotherapies and immunotherapies have shown the best efficacy and represent the standard of care in a large group of patients without oncogene-driven lung cancer and without high PD-L1 expression in tumour cells. Second, the development of chemotherapyassociated pneumonitis is known to occur in up to 16% of treated patients, 14 and cytotoxic chemotherapy has immunosuppressive activity. 15 Notably, administration of chemotherapy within the month preceding COVID-19 diagnosis has been shown to be associated with a higher risk of severe infection-related complications. 16 The clinical and biological aggressiveness of lung malignancies clearly does not allow for anticancer therapy to be withheld or postponed. Thus, while awaiting specific evidence-based guidelines, the comprehensive management of patients with lung cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic should involve specific and careful attention to their clinical and radiological pulmonary signs, more so than for patients with other types of tumour. From a practical viewpoint, it seems reasonable to suggest that patients with lung cancer undergo systematic testing for SARS-CoV-2 at the beginning of treatment and whenever it is deemed necessary by the treating physician in the course of therapy. This strategy might become more feasible with the increasing availability and progressive use of real-time PCR assays that can provide COVID-19 status results within an hour. 17 Furthermore, the availability of laboratory IgM or IgG testing to evaluate the exposure and immunity to SARS-CoV-2 infection will be helpful when the COVID-19 pandemic begins to decline. Allocating resources for these methodological approaches to patients with lung cancer should facilitate the most appropriate clinical management by multidisciplinary lung cancer care teams.",
