Knowledge representation refers to expressing clinical knowledge such as clinical guidelines and care pathways in SNOMED CT. Aggregation and analysis refers to the retrieval of data from CIS for the purpose of secondary analysis. For the purpose of this study, we define implementation as the design, use and maintenance of SNOMED CT in the context of a CIS. \u201cDesign\u201d refers to compiling subsets, developing data entry interfaces, programming search algorithms, selecting a data storage method, incorporating cross maps and developing data retrieval functions. \u201cUse\u201d refers to clinicians interacting with the CIS, receiving training and accepting the system. \u201cMaintenance\u201d addresses the continued updating of SNOMED CT-enabled CIS.",

While there are many publications that describe technical aspects of SNOMED CT, compare the content coverage of SNOMED CT to other term sets and report the use of SNOMED CT in research studies [10], our search for publications describing how SNOMED CT is implemented in clinical settings yielded few results. Implementation publications focused mostly on data capture (e.g., structured data entry templates [11], clinical documentation [12], [13], [14], synoptic checklists [15], questionnaires [16], indexing clinical notes [17]) and to a lesser extent data retrieval through the use of synonyms (e.g., clostridium difficile Infections [18], neuromuscular blockade [19]) and decision support (e.g., nursing interventions for pressure ulcer wounds [23], detecting adverse drug events [20]). While there was a fair amount of detail on how SNOMED CT concepts were used in clinical systems, there were fewer details on how those concepts were stored and what methods were used to facilitate retrieval and decision support.",

Second, each co-author individually reviewed the questions, added questions of interest and prioritised the questions by importance. Third, we discussed together the validity of the questions, combined duplicate questions and after another round of individual prioritisation, pared down the number of questions to 36, spread across 10 sections based on consensus. The first three sections dealt with background information, lessons learned and usability while the last seven sections centred on specific areas of design, use and maintenance.",

For example, the organisation that was using an interface terminology that was compiled and refined over several decades was already able to capture data at a granular level and facilitate decision support functionality, thus limiting the incremental value of using SNOMED CT. One of the reasons for using standardised terminologies is to enable interoperability; however, none of the organisations were communicating SNOMED CT data beyond their enterprise as part of routine operations. The benefit of using standardised terminologies can be achieved once (inter)national bodies formalise their guidelines and quality indicates based on SNOMED CT concepts.",

First, large organisations already have robust interface terminology and will see limited incremental value until information is exchanged with external organisations. As there are very few SNOMED CT implementations in clinical care settings, it is unlikely that an organisation will transmit SNOMED CT-encoded data with other organisations in the near future. Second, the organisations that have been developing their own SNOMED CT solutions have thus far focused on data entry as opposed to data retrieval and decision support functionality and therefore are unable to demonstrate improvement in areas such as the quality of care. Third, organisations that rely on off-the-shelf vendor solutions have been unable to convince vendors to add new functionality due to the limited demand for SNOMED CT and therefore use SNOMED CT in a very basic manner.",

For example, instead of including the subject relationship context in a single post-coordinated expression, the relationship is stored as a separate data element.",

There are also unresolved issues as to how to retrieve corresponding ICD codes from post-coordinated expressions. A possibility would be to test if the concept used in the mapping subsumes the post-coordinated expression but this method has been untested. Tools such as the IHTSDO Workbench and National Health Services Snofyre have the potential to simplify the retrieval process by computing complex SNOMED CT-related calculations such as the testing for equivalency and subsumption outside of a CIS, but to date there are no published studies on the effectiveness or efficiency of these tools.",

Implementing SNOMED CT is a challenging proposition but there are organisations that have navigated the pitfalls and have successfully implemented SNOMED CT in both small and large sites. While a great deal of effort has been spent on developing and refining SNOMED CT, there is still much work ahead to bring SNOMED CT into routine clinical use. The steps outlined in this paper are based on the lessons of early adopters through experimentation and refinement over time. These are necessary steps toward what we hope are eventual successful implementations.",
