In Chicago, Illinois, African Americans account for only 14.6% of the state's population; however, as of April 9, 2020, 51.5% of COVID-positive cases and 67.3% (n=132) of those who died were African American. 2 Furthermore, in Michigan, while 33% of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 as of April 9, 2020 were African American, this population only comprises approximately 14.1% of the state population. 3 Ethnic minority groups may have greater risk of infection due to comorbidities including hypertension in African American populations. 4 Moreover, African Americans are more likely to live in densely populated neighbourhoods of lower socioeconomic status, which may lead to increased exposure from closer contact between individuals, less equitable healthcare access and lower rates of COVID-19 testing. Additionally, the U.S. Bureau of Labour Statistics reported that only 19.7% of African Americans can work from home, in comparison to 29.9% of Caucasians. 5 African Americans may be more likely to work in occupations included within the essential workforce, such as transportation and food service workers. Moreover, on April 8, 2020, Oliver Brooks, the President of the National Medical Association representing African American physicians and their patients in the U.S., stated that \"Many of these jobs also do not provide healthcare coverage, so we are underinsured or uninsured during a health crisis. When adding the underlying health risk factors of heart disease, diabetes and asthma, the African American population is at the epicenter of this current health crisis.\" 4 To gain a thorough understanding of the epidemiology of COVID-19, and to ensure targeted health education and equitable allocation of health care system resources for more vulnerable populations, studies on the race-specific prevalence of COVID-19 and outcomes are crucial. We call for higher priority assessment of racial and ethnic disparities in COVID-19, which may reduce morbidity and mortality among African Americans. As Brooks stated, \"There is still time, but time is running out.\" 4 ",
