            "text": ", the disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a pandemic. Global health care now faces unprecedented challenges with widespread and rapid human-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and high morbidity and mortality with COVID-19 worldwide. Across the world, medical care is hampered by a critical shortage of not only hand sanitizers, personal protective equipment, ventilators, and hospital beds, but also impediments to the blood supply. Blood donation centers in many areas around the globe have mostly closed. Donors, practicing social distancing, some either with illness or undergoing self-quarantine, are quickly diminishing. Drastic public health initiatives have focused on containment and \"flattening the curve\" while invaluable resources are being depleted. In some countries, the point has been reached at which the demand for such resources, including donor blood, outstrips the supply. Questions as to the safety of blood persist. Although it does not appear very likely that the virus can be transmitted through allogeneic blood transfusion, this still remains to be fully determined. As options dwindle, we must enact regional and national shortage plans worldwide and more vitally disseminate the knowledge of and immediately implement patient blood management (PBM). PBM is an evidence-based bundle of care to optimize medical and surgical patient outcomes by clinically managing and preserving a patient's own blood. This multinational and diverse group of authors issue this \"Call to Action\" underscoring \"The Essential Role of Patient Blood Management in the Management of Pandemics\" and urging all stakeholders and providers to implement the practical and commonsense principles of PBM and its multiprofessional and multimodality approaches.",

            "text": "G iven the recent emergence of the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the ensuing worldwide, widespread human-to-human transmission of the related Coronavirus Disease 2019 , the World Health Organization (WHO) has declared a pandemic status for this virus and the virus-related disease. As one of the corollaries, public health authorities and blood services are concerned with decreasing blood donations, ultimately resulting in blood shortages that will unquestionably lead to difficult and controversial transfusion rationing decisions by frontline health care providers. Considering that blood is a perishable commodity with a very short expiration time, as with past pandemics, blood services are being challenged to maintain their inventory during the current COVID-19 pandemics. On the other hand, analyses after past natural and man-made disasters have demonstrated either no change or a reduction in the demand for blood and its use. 1, 2 BLOOD SUPPLY CHALLENGES DURING PANDEMICS The influenza A virus subtype H1N1 (H1N1) pandemic had a significant impact on the blood supply due to donors' fear of exposure to the virus at a hospital or a free-standing donor facility. 3, 4 Similarly, the COVID-19 pandemic has already led to significantly reduced blood supplies due to the cancellation of numerous community-based and mobile blood drives, as well as a marked reduction in donors arriving for scheduled appointments. For instance, as a result of the current pandemic and restrictions on congregating through social distancing, to date in the United States, nearly 4000 American Red Cross blood drives have been canceled across the country. Hospital-based collections have been cancelled due to institutional concerns regarding donors spreading COVID-19 to hospitalized patients or vice versa. These cancellations have resulted in some 130,000 fewer blood donations in only a few weeks. More than 80% of the blood the American Red Cross collects comes from drives held at nonpermanent collection locations. According to the Chief Executive Officer of New York Blood Center, the main blood supplier for New York City, around 75% of their incoming blood supply was interrupted during the week of March 16, 2020, when schools, businesses, and religious institutions closed due to the coronavirus outbreak. 5 Moreover, the number of eligible donors in the course of a pandemic will inevitably decrease due to an increasing number of individuals being infected or in self-quarantine after exposure to infected persons or persons under investigation. In addition, blood collection facilities have put additional screening criteria in place, declining donors with the history of travel from infection \"hot spots\" in the preceding 14 days, at a time when a large proportion of the population had travelled for school spring breaks. Finally, older persons, who often represent the most reliable donor pool, are also apparently among the most vulnerable to the COVID-19 pandemic.",

The same will likely be true for chronically transfusion-dependent patients, including those with malignancies, hematologic conditions (eg, sickle cell, thalassemia, myelodysplastic syndrome), and chemotherapy-induced anemia.

In the context of pandemics, the pressure on blood collection facilities and hospital transfusion medicine services and their staff is also increased as more and more staff members are required to self-isolate, self-quarantine, or become ill. In addition, the effort to continue standard blood donor recruitment will be diverted in part by the growing initiative to manufacture convalescent plasma from patients who have recovered from COVID-19. While this treatment option remains under investigation on a limited basis and is not currently a major source of demand for blood donations, the rapidly evolving nature of the pandemic might quickly change the landscape, creating a substantial new demand.",

Iron deficiency, with and without anemia, is common and is associated with increased mortality in cardiac surgery 81 and may be treated with oral or intravenous iron supplementation. Oral therapy is often poorly tolerated, has a slower onset of action than intravenous iron, and is insufficient to correct iron deficiency in the presence of ongoing bleeding. Intravenous iron therapy is preferred for those with intolerance to oral therapy, severe anemia (ie, hemoglobin < 10 g/dL), or planned surgical procedures or obstetrical delivery within 6 weeks.

Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) are exogenous forms of erythropoietin, including epoetin alfa, the longer-acting darbepoetin alfa, and other emerging ESAs, which may be used to stimulate erythropoiesis. While ESAs are often used in the long-term management of anemia in patients with chronic kidney disease and chemotherapy-induced bone marrow suppression, there has been increasing expansion to short-term use in those with preoperative anemia, particularly when anemia is deemed secondary to anemia of inflammation. 30 In preoperative patients and in the critically ill, ESA utilization with either 100,000 units weekly in the intensive care unit (ICU) or 600/kg in the preoperative period results in higher hemoglobin concentrations and reduced transfusion utilization. 71 Identify and Rapidly Address Coagulation/ Hemostatic Issues Perioperatively Coagulopathy, when not promptly recognized and corrected, can perpetuate a cycle of bleeding, blood utilization, and patient morbidity. 21 There are several evidence-based strategies available for appropriate management of coagulopathy. Point-of-care viscoelastic testing, including thromboelastography and rotational thromboelastometry, facilitates near real-time identification of coagulation abnormalities, thereby allowing rapid and targeted correction of the impaired pathway, rather than relying on unguided administration of plasma and platelets. 84, 85 Transfusion therapies can often be avoided altogether by the utilization of clotting factors such as prothrombin complex concentrates or fibrinogen concentrate. In addition to transfusion-sparing effects, clotting factors also decrease the risk of transfusion-related complications, such as transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI) and transfusion-associated circulatory overload (TACO), the leading causes of transfusionrelated morbidity and mortality. 86 Antifibrinolytic agents, including tranexamic acid and epsilon aminocaproic acid, are widely available, inexpensive, highly effective, and safe pharmacological agents that may be used to stabilize clot formation and prevent hyperfibrinolysis. The use of these agents has consistently been associated with bleeding reduction, transfusion reduction, and improved outcomes across numerous surgical procedures and in trauma settings. 36, 87 Use All Effective Blood Conservation Methods in Both Medical and Surgical Patients There are numerous modalities available for perioperative blood conservation. 88 These include avoiding hemodilution, restrictive transfusion strategies for all types of allogeneic blood components, [48] [49] [50] [51] 89 optimizing physiological response to anemia, early treatment of coagulopathy, and the use of topical hemostatic agents.",

ANH should thus be considered on a case-by-case basis.",

Therefore, it is essential that all patients receive serial evaluation for bleeding, including assessments of drain output, frequent monitoring for hemodynamic status, and physical examination. In patients with suspected bleeding or coagulopathy, point-of-care viscoelastic testing and hemoglobin assessments may be used for the rapid identification of bleeding and coagulation abnormalities, as well as the rapid employment of surgical and interventional radiology intervention to immediately achieve source control.",

Patients who are chronically transfused need prompt and frequent messaging to reassure them that all efforts are being deployed to maintain their access to transfusion. Difficult decisions will need to be made for patients requiring massive transfusion for traumatic injury, gastrointestinal bleeding, and cardiovascular surgery-all with a very poor chance of shortand long-term survival. Transfusing multiple units of blood components to a single patient is not only associated with high morbidity and mortality, but such massive transfusions could also compromise the transfusion support for many other patients in need. 93 ",
