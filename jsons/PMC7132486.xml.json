These patients\u2019 ailments often relapse when treatments are discontinued. Sometimes a patient exhibits a specific pattern of disease that moves from one location to another. For example, one might see a puppy for vaginitis, later otitis externa, and then subsequently for enteritis. A sudden onset of inflammation, odor, pain, and discharge might be present in this patient each time, whereas another individual might experience slow smoldering signs and lethargy whenever sick.",

            "text": "Most veterinarians are well educated in proper diagnostic methods and judicious use of medications. A cat presenting with signs of cystitis only receives antibiotics if warranted by a urinalysis. Using thorough diagnostic protocols to select appropriate medicines often leaves simpler effective treatment lacking for relatively common maladies. Relapses of a condition after discontinuing medication can be concerning. Diarrhea might respond quickly to a bland diet and kaolin and then relapse needing more extended treatment. With time, the returning condition may require strong medicines (with significant potential side effects) to achieve what 3 days of a bland diet had initially achieved. Even with proper treatment, sign severity often progresses from very mild to severe over time. We can often predict the pattern of progression without effectively averting it. The only choice seems to sequentially apply increased suppression to the signs. The temptation arises to apply the big guns to the first outbreak of mild imbalance. This practice often extends the time until the signs return. However, when they do recur, their severity may increase more rapidly.",

These techniques address all aspects of a patient\u2019s illnesses at the same time. A cat that often vomits, has a greasy coat with pruritus, is anxious with a tendency to become irritable, and presents for sterile cystitis no longer has 3 to 4 separate conditions. Improvement of each sign that is being treated is assessed but not as if separate from the others or the overall wellbeing of the patient. Signs are clues to the big picture of patient\u2019s basic imbalance or weakness. Their expression is related to one another as is their treatment. The author presents a very brief overview of modalities she uses as well as some basic treatments that may be useful for beginning holistic practitioners and conventional practitioners interested in integrating a new holistic approach into their practice.",

He wrote a standard chemistry text and translated many medical texts. While translating a text, he noted that the effectiveness of cinchona in the treatment of malaria was attributed to its bitter and astringent qualities. He questioned this assessment recognizing that other bitter and astringent substances had no effect on malaria. Curious as to its action, he took cinchona and developed symptoms similar to that of malaria, which subsided when the herb was discontinued. This experience led him to hypothesize that it was instead the fact that the herb stimulated a similar reaction as the disease that catalyzed improvement in patients with malaria.4, 5, 6 He performed extensive clinical trials administering substances to healthy individuals and recording the symptoms that were repeatedly induced. He used this information along with the known effects of the substances (ie, primary effects and side effects of medications) to select medicines. By administering medicine known to cause a particular set of symptoms to patients suffering from similar ailments, he found this form of treatment to be effective.",

The more detailed the correlation, the more likely the remedy will initiate the physiologic reactions needed to restore homeostasis. A conventional diagnosis is included, but treatment often varies as does the sign expression of individual patients with a given diagnosis. For example, a kitten with a herpes virus infection causing thick yellow oculonasal discharge and sneezing requires a different prescription than one with increased thirst, corneal ulceration, and clear oculonasal discharge that irritates the tissues it contacts. Because proper treatment selection depends on sign evaluation, homeopathy is not compatible with treatments that strongly suppress or alter patients\u2019 signs.",

Many laypersons as well as practitioners will use the term homeopathy to describe any use of substances that have been prepared homeopathically. Homeopathic preparation of substances involves extended vigorous agitation and succussion of the substance, which causes repeated molecular collisions, changing their electromagnetic dynamics. When Hahnemann coined the termed homeopathy, he meant it to describe the method of treatment using medicines that induced signs similar to the disease as described previously. Late in his career, Hahnemann developed the homeopathic preparation of substances and then focused his clinical trials on their use; his earlier clinical trials using homeopathy involved substances common to medical practice of the time, which would have been prepared conventionally. Hahnemann used the term allopathy to describe the use of medicines whose effects do not match patients\u2019 symptoms. Because of the confusion created by practitioners describing widely varying techniques as homeopathy, many people now use the term classical\nhomeopathy to denote the original definition given to homeopathy.",

Range-of-motion palpation of all joints is performed to determine the location of hypomobile and/or hypermobile joints. There are a wide variety of chiropractic techniques available to restore normal range of motion in patients. A modified Gonstead technique is likely the most commonly used in animals. This technique involves the application of a low-impact, high-velocity thrust at a specific contact point in a specific line of drive to gently increase the range of motion to hypomobile areas. In spinal areas, the restoration of range of motion has secondary effects, including improved nerve conduction, improved nutrient delivery to intervertebral disks, and increased toxin clearance from tissues.",

In kittens common viruses associated with vomiting and diarrhea are feline panleukopenia, feline infectious peritonitis, feline leukemia virus, and feline immunodeficiency virus.7, 8 As morbidity for all viral diseases is less than 100%, individuals must be susceptible to an organism to develop signs.

Thorough history taking regarding the previous health of the patient, health of the patient\u2019s mother, husbandry, health of littermates, and nursing/dietary intake will help to identify individuals at higher risk. Appropriately timed vaccination of healthy individuals will help to reduce the risk to severe life-threatening signs. It stands to reason that patients with susceptibility to a given virus would have increased susceptibility to the virus introduced in an altered form (vaccine). In these patients, acute manifestation of pathogenic infection may be avoided via vaccination; however, care should be taken to monitor for and treat any subacute signs correlated with vaccination, such as otitis, ocular discharge, skin eruptions, vomiting, or diarrhea.",
