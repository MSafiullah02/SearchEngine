Room surfaces in the vicinity of COVID-19 symptomatic patients and clinician's protection equipment were found to be contaminated [1]. The primary strategy for COVID-19 patients is supportive care, including oxygen therapy for hypoxemic patients, in which high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) was reported as effective in improving oxygenation. Among patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, HFNC was proven to avoid intubation compared to conventional oxygen device [2, 3]. However, there is an important concern that HFNC may increase bio-aerosol dispersion in the environment due to the high gas flow used. The increased dispersion might favor transmission of infectious agents (such as COVID-19) carried in aerosol droplets generated by the infected patient. This concern is reflected in the limited use of HFNC in the first clinical study reporting 21 patients with COVID-19 in Washington State, where only one patient used HFNC [4]. In contrast, a broad utilisation was observed in the study by Yang and colleagues from Wuhan, China where 33 out of 52 ICU patients were treated with HFNC [5].",

Early intubation increases the demand for ventilators, contributing to the critical shortage reported worldwide. Avoiding or delaying invasive mechanical ventilation could substantially reduce immediate demand for ventilators. Thus, we aimed to discuss the scientific evidence supporting the risk of HFNC induced bio-aerosol dispersion in the COVID-19 context.",

[6, 7] provides a direct visualisation of exhaled smoke dispersion. It appears that when using HFNC, dispersion is greater at 60 L\u00b7min\u22121 than at 10 L\u00b7min\u22121 [6]. We summarise the results from reported in-vitro with different oxygen devices by Hui and colleagues in table 1 [6, 7]. Interestingly, using the same study method and similar breathing patterns, the exhaled smoke dispersion distance from the manikin with HFNC at 60 L\u00b7min\u22121 [6] was similar to the one observed with a simple oxygen mask at 15 L\u00b7min\u22121 [7] and even smaller than with other oxygenation devices, particularly non-rebreathing and Venturi masks [7]. While the dispersion of smoke in this model is instructive, especially between interfaces, particle size of smoke (<1 \u00b5m), only represents a small fraction of the mass of bio-aerosol generated by patients naturally. As aerosol generated by patient's cough contains particles from 0.1\u2013100 \u00b5m, clinical studies are demanded to truly evaluate aerosol dispersion particularly the aerosol dynamics during physiological exhalation and cough.\n",
