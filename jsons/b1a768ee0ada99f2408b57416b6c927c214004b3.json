            "text": "In the course of sequencing telomeric chromosomal regions of the bdelloid rotifer Adineta vaga, we encountered an unusual DNA transposon. Unlike other bdelloid and, more generally, eukaryotic transposable elements (TEs), it exhibits similarity to prokaryotic insertion sequences (ISs). Phylogenetic analysis indicates that this transposon, named IS5_Av, is related to the ISL2 group of the IS5 family of bacterial IS elements. Despite the apparent intactness of the single open reading frame coding for a DDE transposase and the perfect identity of its 213-bp terminal inverted repeats (TIRs), the element is present in only one copy per diploid genome. It does not exhibit any detectable levels of transcription, so that its transposase gene appears to be silent in the bdelloid host. Although horizontal transfers of TEs between kingdoms are not known to happen in nature, it appears likely that IS5_Av underwent integration into the A. vaga genome relatively recently, but was not successful in adapting to the new host and failed to increase in copy number. Alternatively, it might be the only known member of a novel eukaryotic DNA TE superfamily which is so rare that its other members, if any, have not yet been identified in eukaryotic genomes sequenced to date. 32 P-labeled 1,637-bp fragment amplified by the TIR primer and with the 534-bp fragment amplified with the RT-F1-RT-R1 primer pair. The IS5 data set was assembled from 1) IS Finder database entries (wwwis.biotoul.fr), including at least three representatives from each subgroup of the IS5 group, and all representatives from the ISL2 group; 2) Repbase entries (www.girinst. org/repbase/index.html), including representatives of the Harbinger/PIF and IS4EU/ISL2EU superfamilies; 3) top GenBank hits from diverse archaea and bacteria identified",

            "text": "Transposable elements (TEs) are omnipresent in all three domains of life: Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya. Of the two major types of TEs, that is, retrotransposons and DNA transposons, the latter are particularly prone to horizontal transmission (see Silva et al. 2004 for review). First inferred from patchy distribution of P-elements in Drosophila spp. (Kidwell 1983; Daniels et al. 1990 ) and mariner transposons in insects (Robertson 1993) , horizontal gene transfer (HGT) was subsequently suggested to constitute the primary mode of survival for DNA transposons of this type (Robertson and Lampe 1995; Hartl et al. 1997 ). According to this scenario, a DNA TE enters a new host and proliferates within its genome, giving rise to multiple copies, which then undergo silencing, mutational decay, and eventually get erased from the host genome, so that the long-term persistence of a TE depends on the ability of a functional copy to escape into a new host. During such horizontal escapes, however, TEs do not typically cross domain boundaries: no cases of recent HGT between Bacteria (or Archaea) and Eukarya have been documented to date, and naturally occurring cases incompatible with vertical inheritance typically involve movements between taxonomically close groups (Daniels et al. 1990; Diao et al. 2006; Pace et al. 2008; reviewed in Feschotte and Pritham 2007) . Interkingdom transfers, for example, from animals into protists and bacteria, have been accomplished in the laboratory (Gueiros-Filho and Beverley 1997; Rubin et al. 1999) . In these cases, however, expression of the transposase gene involved its placement under a heterologous promoter known to be functional in the new host (e.g., Rubin et al. 1999; Zhang et al. 2000) . Fundamental differences in prokaryotic and eukaryotic gene expression, such as incompatible basal promoter elements, translation start sites, or coupling between transcription and translation, may, at least in part, account for the barriers to successful interdomain transfers.",

As telomeric regions of bdelloid genomes contain numerous foreign genes originated in bacteria, fungi, or plants, it was therefore not as surprising as it could have been in the absence of a massive HGT that a DNA transposon of apparently bacterial origin was also able to find its way into the bdelloid genome. Interestingly, however, this TE appears to have been much less successful in adapting to the new host environment than certain bacterial protein-coding genes, such as the D-Ala-D-Ala ligase gene that is transcribed, spliced, and encodes a functional protein . As described below, IS5_Av integration apparently represented a one-time event and did not result in proliferation in the new host, possibly due to the lack of compatibility with the transcriptional-translational apparatus or damage to the element. Our study indicates that in nature, given the opportunity, TEs highly similar to prokaryotic could incorporate into metazoan chromosomes. Alternatively, IS5_Av could represent the sole member of a hitherto unknown eukaryotic TE superfamily.",

Only cases with 8-bp TSD were considered, as hobo_Av is phylogenetically close to insect hobo elements and therefore should not deviate from the general rule specifying 8-bp TSDs for hobo-like TEs (Rubin et al. 2001) .

Similarly, XhoI-HpaI digest of genomic DNA yields an expected 4-kb band.

The putatively bacterial origin indicated by similarity scores is also suggested by phylogenetic analysis (fig. 3 ). It may be seen that IS5_Av from A. vaga clusters with a specific subgroup of IS5-like TEs, namely, the ISL2 group, which is characterized by 15to 40-bp TIRs, and TSD ranging between 0, 2, 3 and 7 bp, with preference for TA-or TNA-containing targets (Chandler and Mahillon 2002;  www-is.biotoul.fr). There are two known eukaryotic DNA TE superfamilies that are related to the IS5 group of bacterial TEs: Harbinger/PIF (containing Transposase_11 converted domain, CD; 3-bp TSD) and IS4EU/ISL2EU (yielding no transposase-related CD hits; 2-bp TSD) Jurka 2004, 2007; figure 3 . The A. vaga IS5-like element, however, does not fall into any of these clades and neither does it contain any additional ORFs, which represent one of the defining characteristics of Harbinger/PIF and IS4EU/ISL2EU superfamilies. Interestingly, all members of the ISL2 subgroup from the IS Finder database fall into two clades, rather than into a single ISL2 clade. We therefore designated the clade not containing ISL2 as the IS493 group, by the name of its first described representative. Several IS5-like (Transposase_11 CD-containing) ORFs from Trichomonas vaginalis and certain other protists (Entamoeba invadens, Phytophthora spp., Aphanomyces euteiches, and Hyaloperonospora parasitica), instead of grouping with other eukaryotic clades, apparently form their own clade, albeit poorly supported ( fig. 3) . One of T. vaginalis ORFs (TVAG_485520) is single copy and is not framed by TIRs, suggesting domestication of this transposase-derived gene, whereas four others represent typical DNA TEs with a single ORF and 10-20 highly similar copies per T. vaginalis genome. In the Trichomonas families containing TVAG_135750 and TVAG_517480, the transposase domain is fused to the ubiquitin hydrolase-like cysteine peptidase (clan CA, family C19), whereas in the families containing TVAG_148970 and TVAG_413280, the transposase domain is not fused to any other domains. Despite the fact that these two groups of Trichomonas IS5like families differ substantially in their amino acid sequence and their monophyly is not well supported, they share a peculiar feature: Their relatively long TIRs (180-290 bp) contain shorter imperfect hairpin regions, ultimately resulting in formation of an imperfect direct repeat embedded into each of the inverted repeats. It is conceivable that this entire group (designated ISL2PR) evolved upon invasion of the ancestral protistan genome by an IS5-like transposon. However, IS5_Av does not fall into this group either. Instead, it occupies a very basal position in the ISL2 clade, together with two IS5-derived genes from the heterolobosean Naegleria gruberi. Because this clade is not well supported, it is difficult to say whether an IS5-like element was transferred from bacteria into both A. vaga and N. gruberi or between a Naegleria-like protist and A. vaga.",

As the use of splicing or ribosomal frameshifting could in principle lead to production of a full-length transposase in the apparent absence of a correctly positioned ATG codon, we decided to examine the transcriptional activity of the element. RT-PCR analysis of A. vaga RNA ( fig. 2B ) demonstrates that the level of IS5_Av transcripts, if present, is below the detection limits of the technique, whereas the positive control, the A. vaga Ddl gene , as expected, yields a band corresponding to a transcribed and spliced message. The lack of transcriptional activity may account for IS5 inability to give rise to additional copies, perhaps due to the FIG. 3.-Phylogenetic placement of IS5_Av. Shown is a Neighbor-Joining phylogram including representatives of different groups of the IS5 megafamily, which contains six known groups of the bacterial IS5 family (IS5, IS903, ISH1, IS1031, IS427, and ISL2) and two known eukaryotic IS5like superfamilies (Harbinger/PIF and IS4EU/ISL2EU). Also shown are the newly designated groups ISL2PR (from various protists) and IS493 (members of which are assigned to ISL2 in the IS Finder database). Bootstrap support values for the major named groups, obtained by Neighbor-joining and minimum evolution methods, respectively, are as follows: ISL2, 48/58; IS493, 90/89; IS5, 100/100; IS903, 100/100; ISH1, 100/100; IS1031, 100/ 100; IS427, 100/100; ISL2PR, 34/43; IS4EU/ISL2EU, 100/100; and Harbinger/PIF, 51/47. The bacterial IS5, IS903, ISH1, IS1031, and IS427 groups can be joined into a well supported (97/87) supergroup. Support for IS5_Av/Naegleria branch is 51/64.

Alternatively, the element may have been inactivated by a deletion interfering with RNA stability. Finally, IS5_Av may have been inactivated by a frameshift due to a replication slippage in a T8 stretch at pos. 782, whereby deletion of a T would yield a 317-aa ORF, adding 7 aa to the uninterrupted 310-aa polypeptide sequence, or addition of a T would yield a 373-aa ORF. Such an extended ORF, however, does not exhibit additional similarity to the N-termini of any known elements, and there is no apparent reason for transcriptional inactivation due to a single frameshift.",

To check the likelihood of this scenario, we attempted to evaluate the possible usage of alternative initiation codons based on gene prediction models. We scanned the IS5_Av sequence with EasyGene (Larsen and Krogh 2003; Nielsen and Krogh 2005) , which uses a high-quality training set of genes coding for known conserved proteins from each ge-nome to estimate hidden Markov models (HMM) of gene prediction for that particular genome. Of the 138 species with HMM models in the database, 48 did not yield a predicted gene in the 2,020-bp IS5_Av sequence; the first ATG codon at pos. 1,040 was predicted as the optimal start site in 46 species, and as a suboptimal start site in 5 species; the TTG codon at pos. 788 (yielding a 308-aa transposase) was found to be optimal in 24 species and suboptimal in 2 species, and the GTG codon at pos. 884 (yielding a 276-aa transposase) was found to be optimal in 3 species and suboptimal in 2 species (see table 3 for a list of alternative codons, and supplementary table S1, Supplementary Material online, for a complete list of predicted start codons). Thus, for approximately one-third of all database species that yielded gene predictions, the alternative start codons were predicted to be optimal. Although we do not yet know the identity of the putative donor species, it is worth noting that the genera such as Bacteroides, Burkholderia, and Pseudomonas, all of which are represented in table 3, have already been identified as putative donors of foreign genes to bdelloids .

It is framed by perfect 213-bp TIRs and contains a single ORF coding for an IS5-like transposase. Interestingly, the host contains only a single copy of this element per diploid genome. Single-copy TEs are quite rare in eukaryotes, and whenever one TE copy per genome is reported, it is usually identified in a search of genome databases, which are far from being complete, especially when it comes to repetitive regions that are often left unassembled and are missing from most databases.

(The third possibility, i.e., indefinite maintenance of a single domesticated copy in the genome by purifying selection due to acquisition of a cellular function, usually involves loss of TIRs and is therefore highly unlikely.) At which of these two time points did we find IS5_Av? If it were about to become lost from the A. vaga genome after having peaked in copy number, it may be expected to have undergone extensive ORF-damaging mutational decay, often accompanied by secondary insertions, so that the coding region would require molecular reconstruction and the TIRs would have accumulated differences. The perfect identity of the TIRs and the absence of interruptions in the ORF make the recent entry hypothesis more plausible. The lack of expression from a single genomic copy is indicative of its pseudogene nature, and the integrity of a ;300-aa pseudogene would be typically compromised by mutational decay in a few million years (Lynch and Conery 2000, 2003) . IS5_Av resides within an ancient hobo-like element, which underwent insertions of two TEs and, in addition, carries defects in its ORF (a frameshift and an in-frame stop codon). Although the hobo itself is rather decayed, IS5_Av is most likely inserted into the 3# UTR of hobo, because the distance between the hobo stop codon and the IS5_Av insertion site is only 108 bp and does not include polyadenylation signals (which are found downstream from the IS5_Av insertion). A search for TSD-TIR for hobo revealed only one putative 8 bp-TIR-TIR-8 bp combination, fully consistent with IS5_Av insertion into the hobo 3# UTR. Thus, it appears that IS5_Av underwent integration into the A. vaga chromosome on its own and not as a component of delivery vehicles such as phages or viruses, fragments of which would have been detectable in the adjacent genomic environment (but see further discussion below).",

Although the putative donor species is yet to be identified, and there are no other IS5_Av copies in the genome that could be used to determine the level of divergence between copies so as to estimate their arrival time, this HGT event may be regarded as relatively recent for reasons discussed above. The absence of detectable transcription from IS5_Av raises questions regarding the mechanisms responsible for its transfer and successful one-time integration into the A. vaga genome. It may be thought that DNA TEs are more prone to HGT because they can be transmitted as transpososomesnucleoprotein complexes containing TE DNA and the element-encoded transposase, which are sufficient for integration into the target in vitro (in the presence of Mg 2\u00fe ) as well as in vivo. This capacity of the bacterial Tn5 transpososome, for instance, was even utilized in commercial applications (Reznikoff et al. 2004) . Perhaps HGT of IS5_Av into A. vaga occurred when the transposon entered the germ line via routes operating during HGT of other foreign genes , or possibly as a complex with the element-encoded transposase, which was able to complete the integration reaction. However, subsequent adaptation of the transcription-translation control sequences to the new host did not take place, and therefore its genomic mobility was restricted to the initial integration event, because it has never had a chance to produce transposase molecules in the new host, or perhaps yielded only misfolded and/or mislocalized molecules, even if the level of transcription (undetectable by PCR) was sufficient to produce any.",

            "text": "Could IS5_Av, displaying a very basal phylogenetic position in the ISL2 clade, represent a highly diverged member of a eukaryotic IS4/IS5-like TE superfamily, such as Harbinger/PIF, IS4EU/ISL2EU, or ISL2PR, which, however, artificially clusters with ISL2-like transposons as a result of homoplasy? It should be emphasized that members of both previously described eukaryotic IS4/ IS5-like superfamilies typically contain another ORF in addition to transposase: In the case of Harbingers, this extra ORF is characterized by a SANT/Myb/trihelix motif (Kapitonov and Jurka 2004) , whereas for IS4EU/ISL2EU, it resembles a lambda DNA exonuclease, and the transposase itself contains an N-terminal DNA-binding THAP domain (Kapitonov and Jurka 2007) . Because none of these extra ORFs (and domains) could be identified in IS5_Av, it appears likely that the element belongs to a single-ORF family, as do most other bacterial TEs related to IS4 and IS5 (www-is.biotoul.fr; Chandler and Mahillon 2002) . The newly identified protistan IS5-like elements also differ substantially from IS5_Av, both by phylogenetic placement and by the TIR structure. Neither does IS5_Av represent a domesticated single-copy TE (as is the case for many Harbinger-derived genes), because such domestication usually involves loss of TIRs, which are present in IS5_Av and extend for 213 bp without a single mismatch. Although bacterial TIRs in the ISL2 group usually fall within 10-to 40-bp range (http://www-is.biotoul.fr), exceptionally longer TIRs (up to 214 bp) are rare but not unprecedented in other bacterial IS groups (Kholodii et al. 2000) .",
