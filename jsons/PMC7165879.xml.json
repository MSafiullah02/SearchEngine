            "text": "MHC molecules, required for T cell activation and effector recognition, are not constitutively expressed on central nervous system (CNS) resident cells (Aloisi et al.,2000; Sedgwick and Hickey,1997; Xiao and Link,1998). Restrictions on T cell surveillance are further imposed by the blood brain barrier and absence of classical lymphatic drainage (Aloisi et al.,2000; Hickey,2001; Xiao and Link,1998). This quiescent state is rapidly overcome following CNS infections. During virus induced inflammation, microglia readily up\u2010regulate both class I and class II MHC molecules in the presence of IFN\u2010\u03b3 secreted by T cells (Bergmann et al.,2003). However, in vivo detection of MHC molecules on astrocytes and oligodendrocytes during inflammation has been more difficult (Horwitz et al,1999; Redwine et al.,2001; Stuve et al.,2002; Traugott et al.,1985). Whereas class I expression was detected on oligodendroglia during a neuronotropic viral infection, it was not detected on astrocytes (Redwine et al.,2001). Nevertheless, infection of cultured astrocytes with mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) induces MHC up\u2010regulation (Gilmore et al.,1994; Lavi et al.,1989; Suzumura et al.,1986). Furthermore, although IFN\u2010\u03b3 readily increases constitutive MHC class I expression and induces class II expression on cultured astrocytes derived from neonates (Fierz et al.,1985; Massa et al.,1993; Wong et al.,1985), constitutive transgenic IFN\u2010\u03b3 expression was unable to induce class I or class II expression on astrocytes in vivo (Horwitz et al.,1999). Systemic administration of IFN\u2010\u03b3 to mice also did not induce class II expression on astrocytes (Momburg et al.,1986), whereas intracerebral injection did (Wong et al.,1984). The recent unequivocal demonstration of class I expression on astrocytes in vivo following CNS adenoviral infection by confocal microscopy (Barcia et al.,2006), in addition to indirect evidence for MHC restricted CD8+ T cell function (Cabarrocas et al.,2003; Lin et al.,1997) suggests technical limits imposed by histological analysis (Lampson,1995) may have underestimated MHC expression.",

            "text": "In contrast to the CD45lo phenotype used to identify microglia, identification of astrocytes derived from the adult CNS has been hampered by the lack of a suitable surface marker. This study takes advantage of transgenic mice expressing the green fluorescent protein (GFP) under control of the astrocyte\u2010specific glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) promoter (Zhuo et al.,1997) to directly analyze surface molecule expression on GFP+ astrocytes derived from the adult inflamed CNS by flow cytometry. Encephalomyelitis was induced by infection with a neurotropic coronavirus variant designated JHMV. Infection of adult mice induces an immune\u2010mediated primary demyelination, and has served as a model for the human demyelinating disease, multiple sclerosis (Bergmann et al.,2006). JHMV infection induces encephalitis in most strains of mice, infecting ependymal cells, microglia, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes, but rarely neurons (Wang et al.,1992). Following a vigorous CNS inflammatory response, infectious virus is generally cleared by CD8+ T cells within 2 weeks of infection (Bergmann et al.,2006). Control of virus infection in microglia and astrocytes is dependent on perforin\u2010mediated cytolysis (Lin et al.,1997), implicating class I antigen presentation to virus\u2010specific CD8+ T cells. By contrast, viral clearance from oligodendrocytes appears independent of perforin\u2010mediated cytolysis, but requires IFN\u2010\u03b3 (Bergmann et al.,2003; Parra et al.,1999). Despite control of infectious virus by two anti\u2010viral effector mechanisms, viral antigen and RNA persists in the absence of detectable infectious virus (Bergmann et al.,2006). Viral persistence appears to be restricted to astrocytes (Perlman and Ries,1987) and oligodendrocytes (Lavi et al.,1984; Parra et al.,1999; Ramakrishna et al.,2003). Loss of CD8 T cell effector function as well as poor MHC expression on glial subsets potentially contributes to the inability of T cells to control viral persistence (Ramakrishna et al.,2006).",

            "text": "MHC molecule expression on astrocytes was compared with microglia during viral encephalomyelitis in adult mice using flow cytometry. Astrocytes strongly up\u2010regulated class I, albeit delayed compared with microglia. By contrast, class II remained undetectable on the majority of astrocytes, differing from the potent class II up\u2010regulation on microglia. However, once induced, MHC molecule surface expression was maintained following virus clearance and down regulation of IFN\u2010\u03b3. These novel data highlight the distinct abilities of microglia and astrocytes to up\u2010regulate expression of class I and class II molecules in response to virus\u2010induced inflammation and suggest that prolonged MHC expression may provide an opportunity for auto antigen presentation.",

To confirm susceptibility and similar pathogenesis in FVB/N (H\u20102q) mice expressing GFP in astrocytes, virus replication within the CNS and clinical symptoms were monitored until 21 days post infection (p.i.) (see Fig. 1). Virus replication in the CNS of infected transgenic FVB/N mice peaked at 5 days p.i. and then declined to undetectable levels in all mice by 21 days p.i. (Fig. 1A). These data are consistent with the kinetics of acute JHMV replication in the CNS of both H\u20102d and H\u20102b mice (Lin et al.,1997; Ramakrishna et al.,2002), with the exception of residual infectious virus at day 14 p.i., which is not observed in the latter strains. Clinical symptoms in infected FVB/N mice were observed as early as day 5 p.i., and all mice were symptomatic by day 10 p.i. (Fig. 1B). Clinical symptoms reached a plateau between days 13 and 18 p.i. and gradually declined thereafter, with the majority of mice exhibiting essentially complete clinical recovery (Fig. 1B). Although overall onset of symptoms was similar to BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice, the severity in infected FVB/N mice was reduced from an average score of \u223c2.5 (Lin et al.,1997; Parra et al.,1999; Ramakrishna et al.,2002) to \u223c1.5 in FVB/N mice. Despite the reduced clinical symptoms, JHMV infection induced a prominent inflammatory response in both brain (data not shown) and spinal cord (see Fig. 2), as well as vigorous demyelination predominantly in the spinal cord (see Fig. 2).",

Therefore, the composition and kinetics of cells entering the CNS of the infected FVB/N mice were analyzed by flow cytometry. Infiltrating CD45hi cells peaked at 7 days p.i. (Fig. 3A), declined by day 10 p.i. and persisted out to day 21 p.i. Initial infiltrates comprised mainly innate components (Fig. 3B). Although macrophages dominated, neutrophils and NK cells were also recruited into the infected CNS. Neutrophils peaked early and rapidly disappeared by day 5 p.i., while infiltration of NK cells was maximal between days 5 and 7 p.i. and gradually decreased thereafter. As the number of total infiltrates increased, the percentage of the macrophages declined and T cells became prominent (Fig. 3C). While total T cells constituted \u223c3 \u00d7 105 and 10 \u00d7 105 of the infiltrates at days 5 and 7, respectively, NK cells remained relatively constant at \u223c2.5 \u00d7 105. CD4+ T cells consistently outnumbered CD8+ T cells by at least 2:1 throughout the course of infection. The increased ratio of CD4+ T cells to CD8+ T cells distinguishes the pathogenesis in FVB/N mice from both BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice, in which CD8+ T cells prevail by day 8 p.i. Nevertheless, JHMV infection of FVB/N mice overall induces an acute encephalomyelitis closely resembling the pathogenesis in previously described mouse strains (Bergmann et al.,2006).",

Mechanical preparation of CNS derived cells, used to characterize CD45hi infiltrating cells and CD45lo microglia, did not yield appreciable GFP+ glia.

This baseline class I expression on microglia from na\u00efve mice contrasts the inability to detect surface class I on microglia from na\u00efve BALB/c or C57BL/6 mice (data not shown), but may reside in reactivity of the class I 28\u201014\u20108 mAb.

Class I expression on microglia exceeded that of the majority of infiltrating cells by day 10 p.i. These data are consistent with upregulation of MHC class I expression on microglia derived from infected BALB/c mice (Bergmann et al.,2003). No MHC class I expression was detected on astrocytes derived from uninfected adult mice (Fig. 4D). Following infection up\u2010regulation of MHC class I on astrocytes lagged compared with microglia. Although class I expression was barely detectable by day 3 p.i., (22% class I+ astrocytes vs. 63% microglia), it gradually increased thereafter.

IFN\u2010\u03b3 is a potent antiviral cytokine that also enhances MHC class I and class II expression on microglia during JHMV infection (Bergmann et al.,2003). IFN\u2010\u03b3 protein levels were thus measured at 3\u201317 days p.i. to directly gauge IFN\u2010\u03b3 secretion in the inflamed CNS. No IFN\u2010\u03b3 was detected at day 3 p.i. IFN\u2010\u03b3 peaked rapidly between days 5 and 7 p.i. and the levels declined dramatically by day 10 p.i. (see Fig. 7). Overall, IFN\u2010\u03b3 levels detected within the CNS coincided with the robust up\u2010regulation of class I on astrocytes (Fig. 4A) and class II on microglia at day 5 p.i. (Fig. 5A). The high level of IFN\u2010\u03b3 present at day 5 p.i. suggests that NK and T cells secreted abundant IFN\u2010\u03b3 per cell, as T cell numbers were comparable to NK cell numbers at day 5 p.i., but significantly lower than T cells at day 7 p.i. Although a contribution by NK cells cannot be ruled out, the high virus antigen load, in addition to robust MHC molecule surface expression at day 5 p.i., supports the concept that MHC molecule\u2010TCR interactions are responsible for IFN\u2010\u03b3 release (Slifka et al.,1999; Liu and Whitton,2005). Similarly, the abrupt decline in IFN\u2010\u03b3 at day 10 p.i., coincident with the control of virus replication, may reflect limited TCR engagement by MHC molecules presenting viral antigen, despite sustained MHC expression. Alternatively, upregulation of inhibitory ligands may block sustained IFN\u2010\u03b3 expression (Barber et al.,2006; Suvas et al.,2006).",

            "text": "The contribution of astrocytes to antigen presentation during inflammatory responses in the adult CNS is controversial. Although both MHC class I and class II molecule expression is readily induced in astrocytes cultured from neonates, MHC surface expression on astrocytes in the inflamed CNS has been difficult to confirm in adults. In the present study a neurotropic coronavirus infection was used to induce CNS inflammation in mice expressing GFP under the GFAP promoter, thus facilitating analysis of astrocytes by flow cytometry. The virus variant used replicates prominently in microglia/macrophages, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, but rarely in neurons, and induces a lymphocyte dependent sublethal demyelinating disease (Bergmann et al.,2006). Whereas MHC class I up\u2010regulation was readily demonstrable on astrocytes following infection, class II expression was tentative at best, despite strong expression on microglia. Delayed up\u2010regulation of MHC class I on astrocytes compared with microglia further suggested that expression by astrocytes is more constrained compared with microglia. Early class I up\u2010regulation on microglia following virus infection is consistent with IFN\u2010\u03b3 independent induction (Bergmann et al.,2003) and is likely mediated by virus induced type I interferons (Rempel et al.,2004; Zhou et al.,2005). The apparent delay of astrocytes to up\u2010regulate class I expression in vivo may be due to an inherent unresponsiveness to IFN\u03b1/\u03b2; however, virus infection itself and type I interferons enhance class I expression on cultured, neonatal astrocytes (Kraus et al.,1992; Massa et al.,1986). The robust up\u2010regulation of class I on astrocytes and both class I and class II on microglia coincident with maximal IFN\u2010\u03b3 detection implicates IFN\u2010\u03b3 as a driving force for antigen presentation. T cells are the most likely source of IFN\u2010\u03b3, as the absence of NK cells does not alter MHC molecule expression patterns following JHMV infection in C56BL/6 mice (Zuo et al.,2006). The increased CNS infiltration of CD4+ T cells, compared with CD8+ T cells, in response to JHMV infection is unique to infected FVB/N mice and suggests that CD4+ T cells may make a prominent contribution to IFN\u2010\u03b3 secretion in the local environment. However, neither class I or class II restricted viral epitopes have been mapped in this haplotype, preempting experimental verification.",

            "text": "Class I expression on astrocytes is consistent with a perforin mediated mechanism of viral clearance from this cell type (Bergmann et al.2003; Lin et al.,1997; Parra et al.,1999) and the capacity of astrocytes to perpetuate class I restricted CD8+ T cells (Sedgwick et al.,1991). Interactions of class I expressing astrocytes with CD8+ T cells in vivo are further supported by selective destruction of a subset of the astrocytes expressing a neo\u2010autoantigen following transfer of autoantigen specific TCR transgenic CD8+ T cells (Cabarrocas et al.,2003) and by immunological synapse formation between virally infected astrocytes and CD8+ T cells (Barcia et al.,2006). The inability to detect class I on astrocytes following infection with a related neurotropic JHMV variant, which infects both neurons and glial cells may reside in limitations imposed by histological analysis, although class I is detected on oligodendrocytes, microglia, and neurons (Redwine et al.,2001). Therefore, the difference in astrocyte responsiveness may also reflect a unique cytokine milieu induced by each virus. Neurotropic coronavirus variants induce both differential kinetics and magnitude of type I and type II IFN mRNA (Parra et al.,1997; Remple et al.,2004), which may affect class I heavy chains as well as the genes involved in antigen processing and presentation (Strehl et al.,2005). The kinetics of class I and class II up\u2010regulation on microglia in JHMV infected FVB/N mice used in this study are similar to those in BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice (Bergmann et al.,2003; Zuo et al.,2006) suggesting different genetic backgrounds do not suffice to explain these contradictory results.",

            "text": "The apparent impairment in astrocytes to express class II molecules during acute viral encephalomyelitis, despite the presence of abundant IFN\u2010\u03b3, is reminiscent of the inability to detect class II in this cell type by immunohistological analysis (Horwitz et al.,1999; Redwine et al.,2001). Similarly, class II expression was essentially absent from astrocytes in EAE lesions of wt mice (Stuve et al.,2002). CIITA is essential for class II gene transcription in astrocytes (LeibundGut\u2010Landmann et al.,2004; Waldburger et al.,2001). However, although transgene driven constitutive CIITA results in class II expression on astrocytes in non\u2010inflamed CNS tissue, only a very limited number of class II expressing astrocytes are present in EAE lesions in these mice (Stuve et al.,2002). Similarly, although class II positive astrocytes have been detected in lesions during relapsing EAE (Sakai et al.,1986), the paucity of class II up\u2010regulation on astrocytes compared with microglia, demonstrates in vivo cell type specific regulation. These data support that CIITA expression is selectively suppressed in astrocytes during acute inflammation, even in the presence of IFN\u2010\u03b3. Transcriptional silencing may be due to epigenetic regulation or active suppression (Gresser etal.,2000; Landmann etal.,2001; Massa,1993; Tooze et al.,2006). CIITA is regulated by numerous factors including IFN\u2010\u03b3, TGF\u2010\u03b2, IL\u20101, IL\u20104, and IL\u201010 (Dong and Benveniste,2001; LeibundGut\u2010Landman et al.,2004; Rohn et al.,1996). While ineffective IFN\u2010\u03b3 signaling by astrocytes cannot be excluded, prominent, yet delayed, class I expression suggests this pathway is intact. Furthermore, JHMV inflammation primarily constitutes a Th1\u2010type response, as indicated by high IFN\u2010\u03b3 protein levels and low IL\u20104 and IL\u201010 gene transcription (Parra et al.,1997) negating a role for anti\u2010inflammatory cytokines. In vitro, other mediators inhibiting class II expression on astrocytes include TGF\u2010\u03b2, IL\u20101\u03b2, IFN\u2010\u03b2, glutamate, vasoactive intestinal peptide, norepinephrine, nitric oxide, and direct contact with neurons (Dong et al.,2001). An interesting candidate may be IFN\u2010\u03b2 which is rapidly induced following JHMV infection (Zhou et al.,2005), and acts downstream of CIITA transcription to block class II expression (Lu et al.,1995).",

Although class I and class II expression correlate with IFN\u2010\u03b3 levels, maintenance of class I surface expression on astrocytes and microglia, even after clearance of infectious virus, suggest that abrogation of IFN\u2010\u03b3 secretion does not lead to immediate MHC molecule down regulation. Similarly, sustained class II expression on microglia suggests a low turnover rate of MHC molecules. Sustained MHC expression may provide an opportunity to activate autoantigen specific T cells. The expression of GFP in astrocytes enables future enrichment of this cell type for comparative gene profiling and additional insights into the regulation of antigen presentation by both distinct glial subsets and at distinct stages of inflammation.",
