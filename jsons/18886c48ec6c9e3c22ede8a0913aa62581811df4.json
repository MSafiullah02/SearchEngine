            "text": "Viral infections remain a critical issue since the year 1000 when the poxvirus spread through a wide region of China (1) . The large death report in poxvirus infection is often linked to the black death bubonic plague, which kills 75-200 million people in the European continent during the period 1347-1351 (2) . In the year 1901 yellow fever caused by Flavivirus, a filterable agent reported as the first human infected virus responsible for the death of more than 50 million people (3) . Further, in the year 1918-1920 pandemic, Spanish flu (H1N1) is considered to be the greatest medical holocaust in that period affecting millions of people across the worlswide (4) . In the ascent of the timeline different viral infections show their significant impact and responsible for millions of deaths in different countries. A recent unprecedented outbreak of Coronaviruses in Wuhan city of China is declared as a global emergency by WHO. A statistical report suggests that, out of 195 countries, coronaviruses have been spread to 178 countries with the total case of 22,68,011 coronavirus infections, and a death record of 1,55,185 have been reported (till April 18 th 2020) (5) . In a comprehensive outlook, vaccination and antiviral drug therapy are given the foremost priority fight against viral infections. In the last few decades, a large vaccination programmed has been launched to fight against viral infections like polio, smallpox, and hepatitis, etc. A vaccine is assessed by its efficacy and its effectiveness. In the case of the influenza vaccine, effectiveness is lower than the efficacy. This is because influenza often misleads with other influenza-like illnesses and secondly wide diversification in the viral genome. The effectiveness of the viral vaccine is the major concern as a metanalysis report found that effectiveness against flu shows a maximum of 67% in 2012 and thereafter it reduces as mentioned in Figure 1 (6) . Havrix a viral vaccine licensed from USFDA in 1995 for the treatment of hepatitis A. The literature survey reports that 3-20% of acute hepatitis A is observed in previously vaccinated patients. Interestingly most of the relapse cases against hepatitis A vaccine have reported within a short duration of time (less than 3 weeks) (7) .",

            "text": "In the later part of 2009, a peripheral nervous system associated side effects i.e., Guillain Barr's syndrome was observed (10) . Chris Shaw, a neuroscientist at the University of British Colombia expressed the concern that adverse effects may not necessary to appears immediately rather it may take a timeline of 5-10 years as observed in Gulf war syndrome on exposure to the Anthrax vaccine (11) . Henceforth, it is a very critical challenging aspect to access the effectiveness of the viral vaccine, especially against RNA viruses. The second priority is given to antiviral treatment to curb viral infections. There is a lot of antiviral therapeutics available in the global market to fight against viral infections. The recent outbreak of influenza in the year 2008, the two most popular neuraminidase inhibitors Oseltamivir and Zanamivir have been prescribed to control seasonal influenza worldwide. However, the treatment is most effective when prescribed as early as possible after the symptoms developed. The effectiveness of the drug markedly reduces after 48 h of administration. Looking into the antiviral potential, adverse effects such as gastrointestinal associated problems, respiratory problems musculoskeletal symptoms were compromised. After more than eight years of global dominance, the cases of drug resistance have been reported in various scientific documents. In the initial phase of the clinical trial in 2008, drug resistance and population surveillance were very low and further shows highest percentage resistance of 1.9% in the year 2013-2014 influenza season, as compared to the 2012-2013 and 2014-2015 seasons where drug resistance estimated as 0.6 and 0.5%, respectively (12) . In comparison to the other microbial infections (bacterial and fungal), developing an antiviral therapy is always remain a tough assignment to the scientific community. The primary reasons are the highly complex structural ambiguity and unable to identify the viral targets that make the process more complicated to design a selective and effective antiviral therapy (13) . Currently, the unavailability of effective antiviral drug therapy in the global market worsens the situation to a greater extent. Lacking in the concrete information regarding the mode transmission, contact precautions should be an ideal approach to reduce the risk of transmission of newly emerging COVID-19 infection. As per WHO guidelines, infection prevention and control (IPC) is a practical, evidence-based approach to prevent patients and health workers from being harmed by avoidable infections. Statistics revealed that maintaining effective IPC resulted in a >30% reduction in healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) (14) . Hence, considering the global emergency of CoVID-19 infections, preventive care is the only option left to restrict its spreadability. Infections associated with coronavirus may spread by contact, droplet, and airborne transmission. These transmissions will be minimized by taking an appropriate preventive major. The foundation of preventive major against viral infection is initiated with the routine practice of using an effective soap/hand sanitizer/rub, personal protective equipment (suitable mask, eye/face protector, and gowns). For instance, the use of antiseptic hand soaps provides a greater reduction in the number of microbes over a short period as compared with regular soaps (15) . In addition, alcohol base sanitizer restricts the viral growth by precipitating the surface proteins that break the chain of transmission of coronavirus. Moreover, the strength of alcohol is the key factor that determines the biocidal potentiality of the sanitizers/rub. Historical evidence confined the case of coronavirus existence since 1960s in the patient with common cold-like symptoms (16) . Tyrrell and Bynoe found a virus obtained in a culture media containing an infected human embryonic tracheal organ and named as B814. At for an epidemic/pandemic infections across the worldwide by the research community as mentioned in Figure 2 (17, 18) . CoVID-19 is an enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus with the largest genomic configuration of 26-32 Kb amongst all RNA viruses (19) . Coronavirus is a zoonotic virus in which the bat tends to be the most suitable primary host to transmit viral infections. The scientific report predicted that disturbing the natural habitat appears to be stressed in the animal and makes them shed even more viruses in their biofluid like saliva, urine, and feces. These biofluids and feces in our surrounding makes CoVID-19 suitable for spreading the infection through the surface (20). To curb this pandemic infection of CoVID-19, preventive care will play a significant role. The current review emphasizes the various critical aspects associated with the selection of different preventive gadgets such as surface disinfectant, hand hygiene, personal protective equipment that constrain the global spreadability of CoVID-19 infections.",

Alcohols, ethanol (78-95%) and iso-propanol (70-100%) have been used as an effective disinfectant as they show potent virucidal activity with a negligible toxic effect on human skin. All lipid enveloped virus gets inactivated within 2 min. The mechanism of action alcohol-based disinfectant is poorly understood however, surface protein precipitation may be one of the key mechanisms that are responsible for the virucidal activity. Besides this, quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs) are most widely integrated into the surface disinfectant formulation. QACs consist of central nitrogen as a cationic portion surrounded by the negatively charged halogen anion portion. QACs are classified according to the nature of alkyl groups (R groups) which includes the number of nitrogen atoms, branching of the carbon chain, and the presence of aromatic groups.",

For instance, an increase in the chain length from C 12 -C 16 show the greatest antimicrobial activity. These agents are membrane activating groups as they directly interact with the cytoplasmic membrane of bacteria and yeast (23). The presence of long nonpolar tail makes them effective against a lipid-containing virus such as CoVID-19 (i.e., phospholipid layering). The long chain of hydrocarbon act as permeability enhancer that influences the surface-active properties whereas the cationic portion binds to negatively charged nucleic acids condensed inside the capsid leads to virucidal activity (24). Other major class of disinfectant includes halogen compounds i.e., hypochlorous acid, hypochlorite ions. Sodium hypochlorite solutions can be prepared by absorbing chlorine in sodium hydroxide solution to give a mixture of hypochlorous acid (HOC1) and sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) and as mentioned below.",

            "text": "transmission in health care by 50%. Alcohol is being used as a common disinfectant/biocidal agent from the ancient era. The disinfectant property/biocidal potency of alcohol is depending upon the strength and type of alcohol being used. The antiviral activity of different alcohols can be determined by evaluating the viral infectivity index (log 10 value). Viral infectivity is the ability of a virus to penetrate the host cell and use its resources for further production of infectious viral particles(29). In the year 2017, WHO developed two preventive hand rub formulations WHO-I, II against Ebola virus, Human influenza A virus, and Modified vaccinia Ankara strain. Considering the viral infectivity index, formulation (WHO-I) composed with ethanol (85%v/v), glycerol (0.725% v/v) and hydrogen peroxide (0.125% v/v) shows better antiviral activity than the other formulation (WHO-II) composed of isopropanol (75%w/w), glycerol (0.725% v/v) and hydrogen peroxide (0.125% v/v)(30). The biocidal activity of alcohol is mediated through the coagulation of microbial surface proteins.Experimentally it is observed that alcoholic concentration below 50% shows the negligible biocidal activity (bactericidal, virucidal, or fungicidal properties). Alcoholic concentration >90% coagulates the microbial proteins instantly. Consequently, the coagulated proteins act as a shield for the rest of the microbial proteins, hence it requires a longer contact time for biocidal responses. For instance, a 50% isopropyl alcoholic strength kills Staphylococcus aureus in less than 10 s while 90% strength of isopropyl with a contact time of over two hours and seems to be ineffective. Moreover, alter in the chain length of aliphatic alcohol virucidal activity is varied. For instance, the virucidal activity of the lower aliphatic alcohols increases in the series methyl <ethyl <propyl <butyl <amyl, for lipophilic viruses, whereas reverse order is generally true for hydrophilic virus like picornaviruses(31). Further, the antiviral efficacy of alcohol-based disinfectant may potentiate by adding with some organic/inorganic acid such as citric acid, L-lactic acid, peroxyacetic acid, fumaric acid, phosphoric acid, etc.(32,33) The incomplete dissociation of organic acids into ionic species increases their lipophilic nature and their ability to penetrate the contaminated biological materials(31).Incorporating citric acid in alcohol-based disinfectant, the inactivation viral particles is observed less than 1 min(33). A 55% ethanol concentration mix with 0.7% v/v phosphoric acid shows the potent virucidal activity with a mean log10 reduction value >4 on the exposure time of 30 s. Similar type of observations were notices with 73.5% ethanol + 0.2%peracetic acid, 78.8% ethanol + 0.1% citric acid + 1% lactic acid with mean log10 reduction value >4 on exposure time of 30 s (34). A predefined concentration range for ethanol (60-70%) and isopropyl alcohol (70-72%) is preferred as an effective disinfectant/biocidal agent. Based on the above findings, the selection of disinfectant/biocidal agents for a sanitizer may play a substantial role in providing effective hand hygiene. The recent statistical analysis on the sale of hand sanitizer in the global shows a sharp hike in the last few months. Some best sell hand sanitizers are given in",

Furthermore, dehydrated skin is characterized by cracked cuticles that may offer easy accessibility pathogens to penetrate the deeper layer of the skin leads to promote microbial infection. Apart from it, the fire hazard potential of alcohol-based sanitizer is another unavoidable risk factor for the domain of public health. In contrast, washing with soap provides an advantage over alcohol-based hand sanitizer as it comes with zero fire hazard potential. Soap is a salt of fatty acid composed of solid fat (olive oil, coconut oil, palm oil, rice bran, sunflower seed oils, and lard),emollient and texture enhancer (glycerine, sorbitol), surfactant (sodium lauryl sulfate alkyl benzene sulfonate alkyl phenol ethoxylate linear alkyl sulfonate), water softener (penta sodium pentetate, tetrasodium etidronate, and tetrasodium EDTA) (36). Each soap molecule has a long tail of a hydrocarbon chain with an anionic carboxylated head. The non-polar head of the surfactant tightly binds with the phospholipid layer of the viral envelope. Intrusion during washing with water is enough to break the virus's coat that destroys the virus viability. However, the cleaning action of the soap is depending upon the nature and composition of the fat. Depending upon the applications, different types of fats are used in the preparation of soap such as olive oil for providing extra mildness, coconut oil for lather, castor oil for moisturization, etc. Further, investigation of the fatty base, explore the dynamic potentiality of the fatty acids. The cleansing property of the soap is depending upon the hydrocarbon chain length, degree of unsaturation of the fatty acid. Hydrocarbonswith shorter chain length possess good lathering profiling due to enhanced water solubility. However, hydrocarbon chain length less than 10 (<C10:0) shows poor lathering profiling with objectionable odor and skin irritation. Conversely, fatty acids with longer chain length (C16:0-C18:0) enhance the cleansing property with reduced lathering ability due to poor water solubility(37). More interestingly, fatty acids like palmitic acid, stearic acid, oleic acids, etc. provide a greater extent of protection against viruses. Induction of endoplasmic reticulum stress responses and inhibition of autophagic flux seems to be the most promising molecular mechanism that down-regulate the viral growth(38,39). A wide range of fat bases used for the preparation of soap has differed in the concentration of these antiviral fatty acids. Henceforth, the selection of suitable raw ingredients is essential to prepare an effective soap for providing the utmost care against viral infections.",

Droplet transmission occurs within a short range of 1m with someone who is diagnosed with respiratory syndromes like coughing and sneezing. The infective respiratory droplets >5-10 \u03bcm in diameter potentially adhere to the mucosae of mouth and nose and later on invade into the epithelial layer of the upper respiratory and gastrointestinal tract (41). A physical barrier at the checkpoint may reduce the spreadability of droplet mediated viral infection.For instance, the experimental evidence has shown that the use of a protective mask helped to reduce the transmission of tuberculosis by 50% as compared with the patient without a mask. Different masks such as paper mask, dust mask, face mask, surgical mask, laser mask, respirator, etc. are available in the global market. US surgeon General discouraged not to use face mask in the community with the argument that face masks will not provide effective protection against coronavirus infection. In the same context, surgical mask will not provide complete protection against the viral infection as it provides one-way protection i.e., restrict the flow of particulate/ microbes/ infected droplet from the wearer end only(42). Besides this, surgical mask dampened with saliva/biofluid/moisture not only loses its protective characteristic but also it provides a suitable environment for microbes to breed. Henceforth, the selection of suitable effective mask is a critical aspect of the prevention of coronavirus infection. An ideal mask must be built with soft smooth material with characteristic features like breathability, and protection against the microbes (especially virus) and infected droplets. The technical parameters such as bacterial filtration efficiency (%), submicron particulate filtration efficiency (%), breathing resistance /differential pressure (mm of H 2 O cm 2 ), resistance to penetration by synthetic fluid (minimum pressure in mm Hg for pass result) may play a crucial role in the selection of mask. USA center for disease control and WHO recommends N95/P100 respirators with three-level protection FFP1, FFP2, and FFP3 against COVID-19 infection as they filter out 99.9% of 0.3 micron particles.

Cufitec \u00ae surgical mask is approved by USFDA and manufactured with the revolutionary technology which claims the mask not only protects the inhalation but also inactivate 99.99% of the influenza virus on five minute contact with the surface of the mask(45). The antiviral mask consists of multilayers; Outer layer is spunbond polypropylene with a sialic acid coating that restrict the penetration of macromolecules size >0.5 micron and trap the microparticulate size <0.5 microns, Antiviral layer consist of Zinc and copper granule that will kill the trapped virus, non-active layer compose with special non-woven fiber to filter out the particulate less than 0.3 microns and the inner layer is a fluid resistance layer. The mechanism underlines the molecular mimicry as the outermost layer composed of sialic acid (natural receptors) that covalently binds the surface spike protein of coronavirus(46). Once the viruses are permanently trapped then the presence of high electropositive metal ions such as zinc and copper disrupt the membrane integrity leads to damage of DNA and essential proteins that lose the cell viability. Apart from it some of the commercial mask equipped with a layer of activated charcoal as a strong adsorbent layer. The adsorption potency of charcoal depends upon the source of charcoal obtained. The adsorption potentiality of the activated charcoal not only trapped the virus particulates but also promote the inactivation of the virus particulate by adsorbing the surrounding moisture(47). Looking into the diversified specification, the selection of an effective mask may contribute a significant landmark in the spreadability of CoVID-19 infection.Gloves. Transmission through contaminated hands share a major contribution to the spreadability of CoVID-19 infection. A report analyzed that people in the metro politician city touched their faces and common objects with an average time interval of 3.6 and 3.3 times per hour respectively(48). The use of nitrile gloves is preferred over latex gloves because they resist some chemicals, including certain disinfectants such as chlorine. The latex-based hand gloves show a high rate of allergic reactions to a major part of the population. However, the unavailability of nitrile gloves may provide the option for the use of latex gloves. Nonpowdered gloves are preferred to powdered gloves as a powder (i.e., corn starch powder, lycopodium powder, and talc) initiate the skin irritation resulted in allergic reaction on prolonged usage(49).Goggles/Face Shield. The presence of mucus in the eyes make a favorable site for virus sustainability. So, it is recommended by WHO to wear a protective transparent glass, zero power, well-fitting goggles/face shield that covers from all sides with elastic band/or adjustable holder. As per the European standard directive 86/686/EEC, EN 166/2002 and ANSI/SEA Z87.1-2010, an effective googles/facemask is manufactured from acetate, propionate, and polycarbonate that offers improved visual clarity and optical quality with the potential for less eye strain(50).Gowns. Health professionals are at the forefront of risk to CoVID-19 infection due to the possibility of frequent contact. Gowns/Coveralls are designed to protect from exposure to the virus. These gadgets typically provide 360\u00b0 protection because of their unique design that able to cover the whole body. As per the recent memo outline of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, reusable hospital gown is not recommended as they are prone to ripping and would require special sterilization processes to be safely reused. Recently, the director of Ford automobile company announced to lunch a lightweight fabric washable gown from the material used for the manufacture of airbags. The gowns are prepared from water-resistant Nylon 6,6 material with a silicone coating, that can be laundered and reused up to 50 times. Meanwhile, the company conducted internal tests to make sure that the gown will meet the standards set by the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM F3352-19) and the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (ANSI-AAMI PB70-2012).",

Moreover, hypochlorous acid is a potent oxidizing agent as compared to sodium hypochlorite. The dynamic equilibrium exists between hypochlorous acid and sodium hypochlorite is significantly affected by the pH of the medium. At alkaline pH, the equilibrium favored the formation of more stable sodium hypochlorite whereas, at acid pH, the equilibrium favored the formation of less stable hypochlorous acid. It is recommended that a 1:100 dilution of 5% sodium hypochlorite is the usual use to disinfectant by mopping the nonporous surfaces of contact time of \u226510 min whereas disinfecting the items by immersion prefer a contact time of 30 min (25,26). The other disinfectants include peroxides and peracids act by inducing the generation of free radicals such as superoxide ion, hydroxyl ion, peroxyl ion, hydrogen peroxide radicals, etc. that oxidize essential lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids that lead to virucidal activity. The peroxides and peracids based disinfectants (hydrogen peroxide vapor/aerosolized hydrogen peroxide) are best considered for the terminal disinfectant category by replacing formaldehyde as it associated with severe neuro and systemic toxicity(27,28). Further, experimental evidence suggests that various strength of disinfectants such as ethanol, iso-propanol, the combination of 45% iso-propanol with 30% n-propanol, glutardialdehyde, formaldehyde, Human to human transmission contributes a major part to make this infection pandemic. CoVID-19transmission is spread via droplets, cough, contaminated hands/surfaces, etc. However, the prevention of person to person transmission can be reduced by frequent washing with soap and water or disinfectant the hands with an alcohol-based sanitizer as recommended by WHO. The analytical surveillance of a WHO report suggests that improving hand hygiene practices may reduce pathogen",

Hand sanitization is the second pillar of supportive care to restrict the layout of this viral infection. The strength of ethanol (60-70%) and isopropyl alcohol (70-72%) is the optimum strength that is recommended for effective virucidal activity. However, the antiviral potentiality of lower alcoholic strength may be enhanced by mingled with some organic acids like 0.7% phosphoric acid, 0.2% peracetic acid, 0.1% citric acid 1% lactic acid. PPE is considered as the third pillar that strengthens the foundation of preventive care. N95 mask/respirators or equivalent FFP2 respirators prepared from polycarbonate material with a high value of BFE and low differential pressure (breathability) is the best suitable gadget for maximum protection with better comfortability.However, stability and toxicity associated with surface disinfectants, unavailability of suitable sterilization protocol for reuse of PPE are the critical challenges that need to be further investigated.Declaration of Competing InterestThe authors have no relevant affiliations or financial involvement with any organization or entitywith a financial interest in or financial conflict with the subject matter or materials discussed in the manuscript.
