            "text": "The neonatal diarrhoea complex (NDC) is one of the main causes of calf morbidity and mortality causing major economic losses in many dairy and beef herds. Several infectious or nutritional factors may occur either alone or in synergy and among the different infectious agents, Escherichia coli K99, rotavirus, coronavirus, Cryptosporidium, Salmonella, can be implicated as aetiological agents of the disease (Morin et al., 1976, Moore and Zeman, 1991). Enteric infection with these microbial agents is associated with villous atrophy, hypercellularity of the lamina propria, decreased activity of mucosal intracellular enzymes causing nutrient malabsorption, diarrhoea and debilitation. Any pathognomonic symptom does not allow to differentiate them clinically. These different aetiologies without specific symptomatology make the diagnosis and consequently the appropriate prevention or treatment difficult for veterinarians. In practice, a rapid diagnosis is quasi impossible and veterinarians prescribes usually an antibiotherapy and rehydration. A better knowledge of the frequency of the pathogens occurring in livestock farms would allow to the praticians a better guidance in their treatments and would avoid numerous failures in the treatment of neonatal diarrhoea, and the appearance of antibioresistance problems linked to intensive and sometimes abusive use of antibiotics. In fact, despite the cow vaccinations before calving against E. coli, rotavirus and coronavirus, the neonatal diarrhoea persists, and often Cryptosporidium parvum, a protozoan parasite is found responsible of these persistent and treatment-resistant diarrhoea. Reported worldwide, usually regarded as opportunist, it is now recognized as contributing to diarrhoea in various animal species including man (Fayer and Ungar, 1986, Moore and Zeman, 1991, O\u2019Donoghue, 1995). This parasite seems ubiquitous because it has a broad host range, and its survival in the environment for long periods of time due to strong resistance of the oocysts. The organism was first reported in association with calf diarrhoea in 1971 (Panciera et al., 1971). In studies conducted in USA, prevalence rates in the calf population were 6\u201381% (Moore et al., 1988, McCluskey, 1992, Garber et al., 1994). A recent study in Spain reports that Cryptosporidium was detected alone enteropathogen in 52.6% of the diarrhoeic dairy calves (De la Fuente et al., 1999). All the reports from different countries (Angus, 1990), in which only one or two faecal specimens were examined per calf, likely underestimate the actual prevalence of bovine cryptosporidiosis (Fayer et al., 1998).",

Previously, we had reported the importance of cryptosporidia in the French Charolais or Limousin and Belgian Blue-White diarrhoeic calves (Peeters et al., 1992). Reynolds et al. (1986) reported that C. parvum was the second most commonly detected pathogen in diarrhoeic calves in beef suckler herds. Today, it seems that the rotavirus is not the most prevalent agent in diarrhoeic neonatal suckling calves since the enteropathogen the most often detected and statistically associated with diarrhoea is C. parvum. The parasite is associated with a significant high probability of diarrhoea, in suckling calves aged 4 to 10 days confirming the findings by earlier researchers that Cryptosporidium infection in calves is mostly a neonatal problem (Anderson, 1981, Pavlasek, 1982, Stein et al., 1983, Henriksen and Grogh, 1985, Schulz, 1986, Blewett, 1989, Xiao and Herd, 1994; Quilez et al., 1996a, Quilez et al., 1996b). The diarrhoea and oocyst shedding may appear as soon as 4 days of age with a peak at the age of 8 to 10 days where 90% to 95% of the calves are infected in accordance with the results of previous workers (Anderson, 1981, Stein et al., 1983, Schulz, 1986, Blewett, 1989).",

Given the duration of the parasite cycle, which is around 4 days as we had showed in experimentally infected calves (Naciri et al., 1993), we may consider as a first approximation that the percentage of 4-day-old calves on D0 contaminated by the parasite is roughly 70% to 80%; i.e. equivalent to the percentage of 7-day-old calves excreting oocysts. For the calves of 5 days of age and older, this percentage is already at a maximum (90% to 95%). Due to the age structure on D0 of the calves in the study, we may estimate that 90% of the animals were already infected at the time of their inclusion confirming their early contamination soon after birth. The calves permanently with their dams may easily get infected by sucking udders or by contact with contaminated litters. C. parvum has been found in the faeces of adult cattle (Chermette et al., 1984, Mann et al., 1986, Villacorta et al., 1991, Lorenzo-Lorenzo et al., 1993, Scott et al., 1994). According to Scott et al. (1994) cows apparently healthy may excrete between 750 000 and 720 million oocysts daily, thus contributing to the contamination of the newborn calf\u2019s environment. The authors conclude that they are a significant factor in the epidemiology of cryptosporidiosis as asymptomatic carriers that intermittently shed oocysts and are responsible for the diarrhoea in calves born during early calvings. Contamination is then amplified by the infection of first new-born calves (Aurich et al., 1990). On the other hand, Bukhari and Smith (1997) reported that half of oocysts excreted with faeces are non-viable. Nevertheless, even if the number of potentially infecting viable oocysts is smaller than previously suspected it remains sufficient to infect the calves since healthy volunteers become infected with the median infective dose of 132 oocysts (Du Pont et al., 1995).",

The oocyst excretions lead us to raise questions concerning the origin of the contamination of animals during the course of the study. Indeed, given the breeding conditions (no contact with dams, commercial milk), calves isolated in stalls, which had been previously disinfected with steam water and quaternary ammonium, one may wonder how contagion took place. The calves were only allowed nose-to-nose contact. This contamination is far from negligible as the percentage of animals excreting oocysts goes from 16.1% on D0 to 51.9% on D7. On D0, some calves are contaminated. If we consider the prepatent period is about 4 days, contamination on D0 would be revealed on D3 only for some animals (those excreting oocysts the earliest). On the other hand, by D7, all the contaminated animals have become excreting animals. If we suppose that the majority of the 16.1% of the animals excreting oocysts on D0 is no longer excreting on D7, having naturally got rid of their infection, an attentive analysis of individual results shows that 21 out of 31 calves excreting on D0 have a null score on D7; therefore, it may be estimated that around 50% to 55% of the calves not excreting oocysts on D0 were contaminated. These results are similar to those reported by Otto et al. (1995) and De la Fuente et al. (1998,1999). These dairy calves were less contaminated than suckling calves at the same age; probably the stress of transport, change of housing and feeding brings about an increase in the parasite development.",

On D0, the calves were between 8 and 15 days old. At the peak of the incidence of diarrhoea; i.e. on D7, the calves are therefore 15 to 21 days old, which renders it unlikely that cryptosporidia play a role in these diarrhoea. Moreover, the increasing incidence of rotavirus does not explain the concomitant peak in diarrhoea as the analysis of individual results permits to observe that infection by rotavirus on D7 is more frequent in calves with no diarrhoea than in calves with a faecal index of 1 or 2 (Table 9). Therefore, we may conclude that the several episodes of diarrhoea encountered during the study are probably not infectious in their origin but remain principally related to stress, change in breeding conditions, environment and feed. This does not call into question the pathogenic role of cryptosporidia in calves under 15 days old: the probability of presenting diarrhoea on D0; i.e. in calves around 8 days old, is significantly higher in animals excreting oocysts than in animals that were not excreting, and this in spite of a very low proportion of calves presenting diarrhoea on D0 (24/382).",

Large numbers of C. parvum oocysts (106 to 1010 per gram of faeces) are excreted causing contamination by direct contact with other calves, other livestock species and humans. The oocysts excreted into the environment are very resistant and may remain infective for several months either in soil or water, thus contaminating the surface waters and ultimately urban water supplies causing large outbreaks of waterborne human cryptosporidiosis. C. parvum must not (no longer) be regarded only as an opportunistic protozoa which worsens a bacterial or viral disease. Studies must be made for research of effective specific treatments or preventive means to reduce the disease and the oocyst excretions in calves in order to reduce economic losses, the environmental contamination and the risks for animal and human health.",
