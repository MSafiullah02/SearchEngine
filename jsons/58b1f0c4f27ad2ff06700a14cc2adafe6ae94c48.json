Alongside the need to guarantee the supply of key medical and personal protective 35 equipment to control the disease, there is a general concern regarding the preservation of the 36 continued supply of medicines for all citizens. [3] [4] [5] Although no major disruptions in 37 pharmaceutical access have been reported thus far, the existing issue of medicine shortages 6-9 38 may increase, due to the worldwide state of public health emergency. Expected constraints in 39 the manufacturing process (e.g. lockdown of factories due to quarantine) and supply chain 40 disruptions can affect countries' ability to ensure patients' access to pharmacological 41 therapies. Moreover, people's behavior is known to change during an epidemic 10 . Its 42 constraints can lead to states of anxiety, hoarding of medical supplies and rioting. 11 As a result, 43 an increase in the demand for medicines is anticipated, which may enhance the issue of drug 44 shortages, acknowledged for having a negative impact on population welfare, leading to higher 45 demand in healthcare resources and increased morbidity and mortality. 12 46",

This peak was reached not only because of new infections 151 but also due to an increase in the number of analyzed samples during that week. 13 In light of the initial increased demand for medicines and to prevent stockpiling, national 153 authorities have taken several emergency responses. 4 For example, it has been recommended 154 that users should only buy one package of OTCs, with special emphasis for paracetamol 155 presentations.

Daily cases of COVID-19 74 refer to the number of positive test results until the midnight of the previous day. 75 Data analysis 76 For this analysis, the data were subjected to rescaling using the min-max normalization 77 method 16 , in order to become comparable. Data analysis was performed using infections by SARS-CoV-2 in Portugal were reported on March 2 nd , 2020. Up until the 82 end of this week, when comparing 2020 medicine sales with the homologous period (Figure 1), 83 a similar pattern was registered. However, on the week of March 9 th , when WHO declared 84 COVID-19 a pandemic, medicine sales started to increase. This trend went as far as March 13 th 85 (+60% vs the previous week), when the sales peak was reached. Then, on March 16 th , the first 86 death was announced in Portugal and the volume of medicines sold in 2020 began to 87 decrease. As of March 22 nd , sales stabilized and approached those of 2019, although they were 88 slightly lower than in the previous year. The number of new confirmed cases presented an 89 exponential increase followed by a stabilization and reduction during the study period. 90 [Insert Figure 1 about here]",

            "text": "Normalized comes to comparing 2020 medicine sales and shortages(Figure 2), it is apparent that, 95 before the confirmation of the first COVID-19 cases in Portugal, these trends behaved similarly, 96 with the proportion of normalized sales being slightly higher than the normalized shortages 97 (February 1 st to March 8 th ). From March 9 th these patterns started to change, with the 98 proportion of shortages recording a peak (+62% vs the previous week) just about a week after 99 the sales peak occurred. At this stage, the number of new infections by SARS-CoV-2 was also 100 increasing. By the end of April, 1.5 months after the pandemic and first national state of 101 emergency declarations, the proportion of total medicine sales and shortages were below 102 those recorded in the pre-COVID-19 period.103 104 [Insert Figure 2 about here] Normalized time series of the new COVID-19 cases and community pharmaciesshows the trend of medicine shortages and sales for the six identified pharmaceutical 109 substances: 1) paracetamol (N02); 2) ascorbic acid (vitamin C) (A11); 3) dapagliflozin plus 110 metformin (A10); 4) formoterol (R03); 5) rosuvastatin plus ezetimibe (C10) and 6) 111 hydroxychloroquine (P01). 112 For these drugs, some patterns stand out. Paracetamol and ascorbic acid showed similar 113 trends. There was a very substantial increase in supply compared to the first week of data 114 collection. The maximum proportion of sales for these drugs, as for the total market, occurred 115 in the week WHO declared COVID-19 a pandemic. Since then, shortages and sales started to 116 decrease and have stabilized by the end of April, although ascorbic acid's shortages have not 117 returned to normal values. 118 Dapagliflozin plus metformin, formoterol and rosuvastatin plus ezetimibe, all used in chronic 119 conditions, also showed similar sales and shortages' trends. Sales registered the highest 120 proportions during the second and third weeks of March, while shortages reached their 121 maximum values up to three weeks after the first peak in sales. From that point on, the 122 proportion of shortages and sales has decreased and reached values close to those in the presales for the longest period and reaching its peak on the last week of March. As 126 for shortages, an increase is observed from March 9 th to March 25 th , when the maximum value 127 is reached. In April, these proportions slowly began to diminish, but shortages have not yet 128 reached the values verified before the COVID-19 outbreak. 129 [Insert Figure 3 about here] 130 Normalized time series of community pharmacies' medicine sales and shortages in 132 Portugal, regarding six INNs: paracetamol (N02); ascorbic acid (vitamin C) (A11); dapagliflozin 133 plus metformin (A10); formoterol (R03); rosuvastatin plus ezetimibe (best of our knowledge, this is the first study to characterize the outpatient sell-out 138 medicines and shortages' trend changes during the novel corona virus outbreak in Portugal. 139 Community pharmacies are the last player of this supply chain with direct contact with the 140 suppliers and the patients. Therefore, they are in a privileged position to detect and provide 141 data on medicine supply disruptions and changes in demand behavior. Results show that in the 142 week of the first confirmed COVID-19 cases in Portugal (March 2 nd ), the demand for medicines 143 remained unchanged (Figure 1). The greatest growth in volume sales was registered just after 144 WHO declared COVID-19 a global pandemic. This behavior may have resulted from citizens' 145 unfamiliarity with the pandemic consequences and fear of entry into lockdown mode, which 146 was already in place in the closest EU countries 17,18 , as people started to stock up in 147 anticipation of possible drug shortages and hampered access. On March 18 th , the first 148 emergency state was declared, and 4 days later Portugal entered lockdown period. In this 149",

            "text": "Figure 2). The initial increase in medicine shortages could have been caused by a variety of 170 reasons: a) an increment in the volume of orders as pharmacies tried to stock up due to the 171 increased demand and emptying of security stocks; b) a supply chain rupture, related or not to 172 COVID-19 constraints, or c) wholesalers prorating drugs to prevent future shortages and 173 equalize access to medicines classified as essential or with short-supply on the national 174 market. Besides the measures taken by suppliers and in order to reduce the risk of medicine 175 shortages in the COVID-19 context, the Government and the National Authority of Medicines 176and Health Products (INFARMED) took coordinated actions with the European Union. 20 To help 177 preserve the integrity of the national market, the list of medications that need prior 178 notification to be exported or distributed to other member states was updated with the 179 strategic national stockpile medicines. 22 It must be considered that exportation problems and 180 parallel trade mechanisms within the EU members are often identified as possible causes for 181 shortages in countries with lower prices such as Portugal. 23,24 So far, data suggest that the 182 medicines' unavailability situation is stable. However, some manufacturers seem to be 183 struggling to ensure a continuous production and/or distribution of their products to the 184 Portuguese market. For instance, since January 2020, paracetamol's, rosuvastatin plus ezetimibe's and formoterol's marketing authorization holders (MAH) have reported temporary 186 medicines' unavailability to Portuguese health authorities. 25 187 Tackling drug shortages is essential. Medicines are effective technology, and, if used correctly, 188 can provide major benefits to patients. At this stage, there is a concerning evidence of 189 underuse of healthcare due to COVID-19 and increased mortality for all causes compared to 190 the homologous period, especially among older people. 26,27 It is crucial to ensure that patients 191 maintain safe and timely access to their medicines in order to avoid additional distress, disease 192 progression and/or worsening of symptoms due to delay in treatment, potential dose 193 reduction or even treatment interruption. 194Insights from the six pharmaceutical substances 195 The demand for paracetamol rocked up just after the declaration of the first official positive 196 case in Portugal (Figure 3), which may be explained by the fact it is used to treat fever, one of 197 the most common symptoms of COVID-19. 28 An increased demand for OTC ascorbic acid's oral 198 forms was also recorded after the media highlighted the possible benefits of vitamin C intake 199 as a prophylactic measure, given its effect on immune system reinforcement. 29 However, 200 despite a recent published RCT carried out in USA patients with sepsis related to acute 201 respiratory distress syndrome, which indicated that high daily intra venous dosage (~ 15 g/day) 202 of vitamin C for 4 days may decrease mortality, 30 there is no evidence that vitamin C can 203 prevent COVID-19. 31 Although sales have already fallen to normal values, shortages remain 204 high, which may indicate a lack of product in the market to meet demand needs. 205 As for formoterol, a medicine used to control moderate to severe forms of asthma and chronic 206 pulmonary obstructive disease, 32 the demand surge is in line with the virus outbreak (Figure 3). 207 Rosuvastatin plus ezetimibe, an association of lipid lowering drugs used to treat patients with 208 high cardiovascular risk 33 , and dapagliflozin plus metformin, 34 an association of antidiabetic 209 agent, present very similar sales' patterns (Figure 3). They are expensive medicines and quite 210 recent in the Portuguese market (2018 and 2016, respectively), with scarcely available 211 therapeutic equivalents. 25 The increased demand for these medicines may be due to a fear of 212 being infected, since chronic patients are at risk of more severe clinical outcomes if they 213 contract the coronavirus. Furthermore, it is possible that patients have already experienced 214 shortages of these brand medicines as this has been a constant problem in the last years. 7,35 215 Formoterol and dapagliflozin plus metformin remain with a high proportion of shortages, 216 which may indicate an undersupply issue that can compromise access to these therapeutics in 217 the long run. 218 Although currently there is no known effective treatment or vaccine to fight the virus, 219 hydroxychloroquine has showed some effectiveness in COVID-19 treatment. 36-38 Despite the 220 positive results, EMA recommended the use of this drug only on clinical trials and according to 221 national protocols. 39 However, the use of hydroxychloroquine in patients with coronavirus 222 pneumonia was widespread 37 and the medical prescription and demand for this medicine 223 tripled(Figure 3). About two-months after the first confirmed cases in Portugal, 224 hydroxychloroquine shortages remain high, which suggests pharmacies still struggle to fulfill 225 these orders. As this medicine is used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and lupus and 226 also as an antimalaria drug, the off-label use demand and market unavailability can impact 227 patients' welfare.40  . 228At this moment, no major supply disruptions are recorded. However, the long-term impacts of 229 this pandemic are unknown and should be monitored, especially bearing in mind the 230 concerning historical problem of medicine shortages in Europe.",
