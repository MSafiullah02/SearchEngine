A limited number of epidemiologic studies that have attempted to specifically address the role of one or more HVAC-related factors on APT are identified in this review. In the following discussion, the strengths and weaknesses of each study are addressed. Given the complexities of APT and the wide variety of HVAC systems, it should be understood that no one study will answer the general question as to the role of HVAC systems in APT. At best, a given study will be able to address one or very few HVAC factors and one or very few diseases. This review is not intended to criticize the studies that have been conducted but rather is intended to evaluate them in a way that makes it possible to see what was learned from them about how to assess the impact of mechanical ventilation on APT in future studies. It should be understood that it is one thing to identify desired features and methodologies; however, resource constraints are almost universally a limiting factor in epidemiologic studies.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Epidemiologic studies"}, {"text": "Studies prior to 2000 used descriptive approaches to assessing ventilation rates (Table 1 ). An exception was the investigation of a respiratory infection outbreak in an overcrowded Houston jail by Hoge et al. (1994) . The case-control and cohort studies began after two inmates died on the same day of pneumococcal sepsis. The first 25 case patients hospitalized were enrolled in a case-control study. For each case, three inmates living in the same cellblock were randomly selected as controls. The jail had a constant volume, recirculated air HVAC system operating at maximum capacity; 20% of the total volume of air delivered was outdoor air and 80% was recirculated. Each cellblock had its own recirculation system. Outdoor air ventilation was evaluated by measuring CO 2 levels and airflow rates to the living areas of the jail. Carbon dioxide levels were measured using detector tubes [this method usually results in high potential errors and is not recommended, Sepp\u20ac anen et al. (1999) ]. Airflow was measured in the center of duct using a thermal anemometer. There is no mention of a traverse of the duct to show that the velocity at the center was a valid estimate of average velocity (recommended). Volume of outside air delivered per person was calculated but there is no mention if it came from CO 2 levels or from an assumed percentage of outside air from total supply air. The respiratory infection incidence rate was highest among inmates in cellblocks with the highest CO 2 levels and the lowest volume of outside air delivered by the HVAC system. This study showed the impact of occupancy and OA ventilation rate per person on disease outcome and investigators concluded that overcrowding and inadequate ventilation contributed to the outbreak. It was an advance forward compared to other studies during this period because it used quantitative measures collected close to the time of investigation. Among military barracks, two studies report that tighter buildings with HVAC systems with recirculation showed a higher rate of upper respiratory symptoms or infection (Brundage, 1988; Richards et al., 1993) . Richards et al. (1993) report on a cross-sectional study conducted with questionnaires. This study assessed the health impact of exposure to sand storms and crowded barracks in Saudi Arabia. The accommodations in which the soldiers slept were categorized as tent, warehouse, non-air-conditioned (AC) and AC buildings. There was a trend of increasing risk for complaints of a sore throat and cough by troops who were less exposed to the outdoor environment, with troops sleeping in AC buildings having the highest risk of developing these symptoms. It is difficult to draw conclusions about what factor related to AC buildings contributed to higher risk of symptoms without a more quantitative comparison of the differences between building categorizations. Brundage (1988) was a prospective cohort study on a population of newly trained soldiers in the army. This study's strengths were that it was conducted over 4 years, had a very large sample size, the population was diverse geographically and demographically, was randomly assigned to building type, and it captured variability in illness years, meaning the time frame encompassed two epidemics as well as years of low illness rates. Incidence rates of febrile acute respiratory disease were significantly higher among trainees in modern barracks that had lower design outdoor air change rates due to energy conservation measures. An important strength of this study was the standardized diagnosis and treatment of disease across locations and conditions of the study. Quantitative measurements comparing HVAC characteristics of modern, more energy efficient buildings vs. older, less energy efficient buildings as well as better descriptions of the HVAC systems themselves would have enhanced our understanding of the differences in building type ventilation performance.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 198, "end": 216, "text": "Hoge et al.

This study performed an assessment of the HVAC system by measuring air change rates using a tracer gas method with pure CO 2 and noting the direction of airflow at all doors, windows, and vents with smoke tubes. Note that this measurement accounted for both mechanical ventilation and any infiltration. The percentage of rooms on each nursing unit that met the current ventilation standard was also calculated for each hospital, with results varying from 19 to 87% of rooms meeting the standard for a given hospital. Researchers concluded that in Canadian hospitals that admitted at least six patients with TB annually, tuberculin conversion among HCW was strongly associated with inadequate ventilation in general patient rooms defined as <2.0 air changes per hour (ACH). It was also associated with type and duration of work. Of note is that researchers accounted for community exposure as well, which would be an important confounder. Ventilation measurements and inspection were performed in 339 patient care areas. One of the largest limitations of the study is that ventilation was assessed based on tracer gas measurements of air change rate during the course of 1 day. Although the type of HVAC system is not mentioned, it is likely that air change rates varied significantly throughout the year, especially considering that the hospitals were located in areas with extreme outdoor conditions. For this reason, a single day of measurements may not represent the HVAC system operation over the course of 3 years, the time period in which tuberculin conversions were documented. Additionally, ACH can be an unclear measure if the composition of the dilution air is unknown (outside air, air from an adjacent space, recirculated air from other spaces, etc.). It can refer to the outdoor air change rate if dilution air comes solely from outdoors, but in many cases the composition of the dilution air is unknown. Milton et al. (2000) analyzed sick leave data for 3720 employees among 40 buildings with 115 independently ventilated work areas at Polaroid Corporation corporate offices. Corporate records for building characteristics and indoor environmental quality complaints were used. Myatt et al. (2002 Myatt et al. ( , 2004 studied buildings in the same Polaroid Corporation offices. Outdoor air ventilation rates were estimated from continuous CO 2 measurements for a subset of work areas using ASHRAE Standard 62-1989. A rating of 'moderate' (around 25 cfm/person, 12 l/s-person) or 'high' (around 50 cfm/person, 24 l/s-person) was given to each floor by an expert industrial hygienist. There was a consistent association of increased sick leave with lower levels of outdoor air supply. Some limitations of this study include a broad categorization of OA ventilation rates, sampling in what appears to be a single location to characterize a floor, calculations from measurements that may have a high degree of uncertainty (not reported), and not all work areas were sampled. A strength, however, is that the engineer taking measurements and assigning OA ventilation ratings had prior knowledge of the system performance and any modifications that had been made to existing HVAC systems. Myatt et al. (2002) conducted an intervention study in two Polaroid Corporation office buildings using short-term sick leave and CO 2 measurements as a surrogate for outdoor air supply rates. It was an intervention because they blindly varied the outdoor air supply dampers. They calculated the CO 2 concentration differential by subtracting the nightly background from the daily average levels. There was no association between CO 2 differential at the values studied with sick leave, albeit differential concentrations were relatively low, ranging from 37-250 ppm. They hypothesized that the buildings had an excess of OA ventilation capacity relative to the volume of office space and number of workers. Researchers estimated that <450 ppm above background, it was unlikely that rhinovirus would be transmitted from one office worker to another via the airborne route and for that reason no association between CO 2 and sick leave was found. Some of the methods developed in this study were used in the Myatt et al. (2004) study. Conducting a preliminary study of methods prior to implementing a larger study is a good approach, as this will ensure enough power to see an association, improve data collection methods, and identify any possible confounding. Power is the probability that the null hypothesis is rejected if a specific alternative hypothesis is true. It is a measure of Type II error and is influenced by other factors such as significance level (Type I error) and sample size. Myatt et al. (2004) conducted a prospective intervention study. It is one of the strongest study designs to date, because it used a direct airborne exposure measurement; air filters were collected for rhinovirus detection and analyzed using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques. While the direct exposure measurement of an airborne pathogen is an improvement from an indirect exposure measurement such as CO 2 , it is the outcome of infection in conjunction with the presence of airborne pathogens that best informs the risk assessment of aerosol transmission. Ultimately, clinical confirmation of infection would be ideal for outcome measurements, but even outcome measurements with relatively high uncertainty such as absence data would be better than no measurement. Three Polaroid Corporation office buildings were assessed over 20 months. Occupancy was recorded every week. Outdoor air supply dampers were artificially and blindly adjusted every three months to reduce or increase the outdoor air supply and thereby extend the range of CO 2 . This was a unique approach to 'experimenting' with the outdoor airflow rates. Carbon dioxide differential above the background was used according to the methods of Myatt et al. (2002) . A significant positive relationship was found between the frequency of virus detection in air samples and average CO 2 concentrations greater than 100 ppm above background. In addition, one sample from a nasal lavage contained single-stranded conformational polymorphism assay band patterns that were an exact match to a building air sample collected during the same week, indicating that the same virus was found on both samples. This suggests that occupants in buildings with low outdoor air supply may have an increased risk of exposure to infectious droplet nuclei emanating from a fellow building occupant. The methods used in Myatt et al. (2004) provide a good starting point for protocols to measure exposure using air sampling in which RNA is extracted from air filters and amplified using PCR.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 206, "end": 228, "text": "(Menzies et al., 2000)", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 2149, "end": 2169, "text": "Milton et al.

Over the course of 4 years, in which these investigators were focusing on this research, methods evolved to make the study more significant and have more power. In the Milton study, they first used CO 2 to categorize high or low OA ventilation rates based on a few CO 2 measurements and primarily the judgment of an industrial hygienist assigning ventilation rates. In the work of Myatt, they instead took CO 2 measurements above background more frequently and intervened by adjusting and locking outdoor air intake dampers into place over specified time intervals to increase the range of CO 2 concentrations. In the health assessment they moved away from outcome measurements of sick leave to an objective exposure measure of airborne rhinovirus. Wong et al. (2004) conducted a retrospective cohort study of a SARS outbreak at a Hong Kong hospital. They did an inspection of the hospital HVAC system after the outbreak, measuring the airflow rates, velocities, temperatures, and relative humidity (RH) at all supply diffusers and exhaust grilles in the ward. A subsequent study simulated the bioaerosol dispersion in the hospital ward using computational fluid dynamics and provided a more detailed description of the HVAC system (Li et al., 2005) . The air change rate was found to be 7.8 ACH for the entire ward; but it was not reported whether this was the outdoor or supply air change rate, and methods for determining ACH were not described. Based on the measurement methods and presence of recirculation, we believe the reported ACH is likely the supply air change rate. It was found that the supply and exhaust airflow rates were imbalanced, with some supply diffusers and exhaust grilles not functioning properly. The index patient's cubicle was found to have the highest supply flow rate, while the adjacent exhaust grille had the lowest flow rate among all four functional exhaust grilles in the ward. It is possible that this imbalance in the supply and exhaust airflow rates promoted the dispersion of infectious aerosol from the index patient's cubicle to other hospital areas. Since this study was for only one building, the measurement approach could be more comprehensive in nature. An issue was that they could not collect measurements at the time of outbreak, so it was done four months later, in July. The outbreak was in March, so a subsequent comparison of seasonal differences in ventilation performance would have been important since spring and summer weather in Hong Kong can be quite different and thus the outdoor air supply may vary significantly depending on design. The design of the system supplying air to the ward was not reported (i.e., variable vs. constant air volume), so it is possible that supply airflow also varied based on factors such as heat loads. Haselbach et al. (2009) reported a re-analysis of data collected from a cross-sectional study of six different military barracks and over 5000 cases of acute respiratory infections (ARIs). Data were collected in February-May 2004. Researchers documented the rate of ARIs, average room occupancy, and average HVAC contact population (sum of occupants from multiple zones that share return air that is mixed within the same HVAC system and redistributed as supply air). Average contact population was a unique variable in this study as it placed more emphasis on airborne transmission via the HVAC system than direct and indirect contact transmission. Distance between bunks, CO 2 levels, and RH were also measured. It is not clear from the study description how they used these measurements in the data analysis. They categorized the barracks according to age, construction, and HVAC system configuration and then assessed disease prevalence in each category of barrack. Results showed that occupancy affected risk of ARI transmission and the resulting prevalence rate ratios suggest that there was a significant risk of airborne ARI transmission through HVAC systems. Higher rates of infection were found in the systems with both higher HVAC contact populations and less access to operable windows. Depending on the HVAC configuration, average HVAC contact population may be a useful parameter to include in future epidemiologic studies. In military barracks, large numbers of military recruits live in close proximity, and they are usually young and healthy.

Carbon dioxide was measured in short term, 5-min averages on a single school day, at variable times of the day. All but 2 of 434 classrooms had individual HVAC systems. A 1000-ppm increase in CO 2 was significantly associated with a 0.5-0.9% decrease in annual ADA, corresponding to a relative 10-20% increase in student absence. The authors stated: 'In general, random errors in an independent variable, in this case the errors from using short-term CO 2 as a measure of long-term average ventilation rate, will tend to obscure and weaken associations with the dependent variable (in this case, attendance or absence).' This conclusion supports our recommendation that more accurate data are desirable and the total variability in the study factor must be estimated. Mendell et al. (2013) collected classroom-level illness absence and demographic data from participating school districts in 28 schools in three different climate zones within California. They measured real-time CO 2 concentrations in each participating classroom for 2 years. This study found a significant relationship between classroom OA ventilation rates and illness absence for all combined schools: for every additional 1 l/s-person of ventilation (2.1 cfm/person), illness absence was reduced by 1.6% (within the study's ventilation rate range of 2-20 l/s-person, 4.2-42.4 cfm/person). Mendell et al. installed an internet-connected indoor environmental quality sensor in each classroom. Sensors transmitted CO 2 , temperature, and RH data as 5-minute averaged values. Outdoor air ventilation rate per person was calculated with a mass balance model that used the indoor CO 2 equilibrium concentration minus the outdoor value. The analysis assumed wellmixed conditions, and that steady state was reached for CO 2 . The steady-state approximation is particularly questionable as simple transient mass balances indicate that steady state is unlikely to be reached during the time period in which the students were continuously in the classroom. While the lack of true steady-state conditions may limit the accuracy of the OA ventilation rate calculations, the CO 2 levels measured provide a good indication of actual instantaneous exposure to exhaled air. Additionally, 37% of classrooms studied were ventilated naturally from window opening, not mechanically.

Myatt et al. (2004) , Sun et al. (2011 ), Shendell et al. (2004 , and Mendell et al. (2013) used indoor-outdoor CO 2 differences to estimate the contribution of outdoor air. Menzies et al.

CO 2 methods do not always just measure the outdoor air component of ventilation. If the zone of measurement is not the entire building, then the zone may have dilution from other areas of the building, such as infiltration through connecting doorways.

Large-scale evidence should be targeted for research questions where the pre-study probability is considerably high, so that a significant research finding would be considered definitive (Ioannidis, 2005) . The prestudy probability in this case does seem high, given the studies completed to date, so that a well-designed wellfunded study should result in clear evidence. Ioannidis states the large-scale evidence is also particularly indicated when it tests major concepts. The concept in question is a broad onewhat is the causal association between mechanical ventilation and APT, so in fact it is a worthwhile endeavor to pursue.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1299, "end": 1316, "text": "(Ioannidis, 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conclusions"}, {"text": "Establishing causality, however, is just the first step. It is generally believed and accepted that HVAC system factors can and do impact APT so establishing causality is mostly a matter of confirming the obvious. Quantitative relationships between HVAC factors and APT are needed for effective design and operation of HVAC systems. For example, how much outdoor air ventilation (at a given recirculation filter rating) is needed for a classroom with a given occupancy to avoid elevated disease outcomes? Thus, additional epidemiologic studies as well as meta-analyses will establish the causality that is needed to focus on providing definitive quantitative relationships.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conclusions"}], "bib_entries": {"BIBREF0": {"ref_id": "b0", "title": "Standard Test Method for Determining Air Change in a Single Zone by Means of a Tracer Gas Dilution, ASTM Standard E741-11", "authors": [], "year": 2011, "venue": "ASTM", "volume": "", "issn": "", "pages": "", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF1": {"ref_id": "b1", "title": "Standard Guide for Using Indoor Carbon Dioxide Concentrations to Evaluate Indoor Air Quality and Ventilation, ASTM Standard D6245-12", "authors": [], "year": 2012, "venue": "ASTM", "volume": "", "issn": "", "pages": "", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF2": {"ref_id": "b2", "title": "Building-associated risk of febrile acute respiratory diseases in army trainees", "authors": [{"first": "J", "middle": ["F"], "last": "Brundage", "suffix": ""}], "year": 1988, "venue": "JAMA J.
