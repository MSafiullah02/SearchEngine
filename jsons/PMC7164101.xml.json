            "text": "The function of eukaryotic cells relies on the transport of macromolecules and small organelles throughout the cytoplasm. Microtubules are polar cytoskeletal filaments assembled from thousands of \u03b1/\u03b2 tubulin heterodimers which are nucleated and organized by the perinuclear microtubule organizing centre (MTOC). Whereas kinesin and dynein motors use microtubules to move cargo throughout the cytoplasm, myosin motors interact with actin filaments [1, 2, 3]. Cytoplasmic dynein, frequently in cooperation with its cofactor dynactin, is a minus\u2010end\u2010directed microtubule associated motor responsible for retrograde transport (towards the nucleus) in eukaryotic cells [4, 5, 6]. This molecular motor is a large multiprotein complex of approximately 1.2 MDa that contains heavy chains, intermediate chains, light intermediate chains and light chains. Cytoplasmic dynein plays critical roles in a variety of eukaryotic cellular functions, including Golgi maintenance, nuclear migration, retrograde axonal transport and organelle positioning. In addition, cytoplasmic dynein is involved in numerous aspects of mitosis, such as spindle formation and organization, spindle orientation and mitotic checkpoint regulation [7, 8].",

            "text": "Cargoes transported by dynein are linked to the motor via the tail, which consists of an N\u2010terminal section of one or more heavy chains and a number of associated polypeptides [4, 5, 9, 10]. In general, the cytoplasmic dynein complex is resolved on SDS/polyacrylamide gels into subunit polypeptides of \u223c 530 (dynein heavy chains, DYNC1H), \u223c 74 (intermediate chains, DYNC1I), \u223c 53\u201359 (light intermediate chains, DYNC1LI) and \u223c 10\u201314 kD (light chains). Cytoplasmic dynein heavy chain, with \u223c 4650 amino acids in humans, is among the largest polypeptides found in mammalian cells. Dimeric dyneins have a conserved tail structure in which the heavy chains dimerize through protein\u2013protein interactions mediated by amino acids 300\u20131140 in the tail region (Fig. 1) [11]. In addition, dynein heavy chain residues 446\u2013701 and 649\u2013800 are involved in intermediate chain and light intermediate chain binding respectively [11]. In the case of cytoplasmic dynein, intermediate chain is also able to form homodimers through interactions mediated by residues 151\u2013250 [12]. Furthermore, in mammals, the 74 kDa cytoplasmic intermediate chain is homologous to the 67 kDa axonemal intermediate chain [13]. Three highly conserved light chains, also shared by axonemal dyneins, Tctex1 (DYNLT1), LC8 (DYNLL1) and roadblock (LC7 or DYNLRB1), bind to distinct regions of the intermediate chains, always as homodimers [14, 15]. DYNLL, a ubiquitous molecule, is the most highly conserved among light chains and, interestingly, in spite of lacking sequence homology displays a three\u2010dimensional fold almost identical to that of DYNLT [16, 17, 18]. Both DYNLT and DYNLL form homodimers with \u03b1\u2010helices flanking a shared central \u03b2\u2010sheet, with the peptides from interacting partners lengthening the preformed \u03b2\u2010strand. Indeed, according to the recently published crystal structures [19, 20] the two short, consecutive protein stretches of dynein intermediate chain that bind to DYNLT and DYNLL adopt an extended conformation (Fig. 1). However, DYNLRB, also a ubiquitous component of cytoplasmic dyneins, is structurally different from Tctex1 and LC8, with a dimer interface that includes the coiled\u2010coiled pairing of two \u03b1\u2010helices [21]. Unlike when binding to DYNLT or DYNLL, two sequential helical segments of dynein intermediate chain associate to DYNLRB (Fig. 1). In addition to these three light chain homodimers, there is also a dimer of DYNC1LI bound to the tail of cytoplasmic dyneins. Consistent with a role in cargo binding, DYNC1LI has been shown to bind to the core centrosomal protein pericentrin [22]. Thus, since dynein light and light intermediate chains appear to associate with cargo, it has been suggested that viruses might target these cellular components during infection processes.",

Experiments in which microtubule\u2010depolymerizing agents such as colchicine, nocodazole or vinblastine were used have shown that the integrity of the microtubules is essential for virus infection. Many pathogens causing widespread illness including herpes simplex virus (HSV) [34, 35], adenovirus [35, 36], hepatitis B virus [37], human cytomegalovirus [38], human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) [39], African swine fever virus (ASFV) [40], parvovirus [41], influenza virus [42], papillomavirus (PV) [43] and rabies virus (RV) [44] rely on microtubules for efficient nuclear targeting and successful infection.",

More recently, video microscopy using green fluorescent protein (GFP) tagged viral proteins has also demonstrated the retrograde advance of viruses towards the cell nucleus. In particular, retrograde transport of HSV in axons has been visualized using time\u2010lapse fluorescent microscopy [50]. Similarly, GFP\u2010tagged poliovirus receptor, which associates to dynein light chain DYNLT1, colocalizes with Alexa fluor 555\u2010labelled poliovirus and both undergo retrograde transport along microtubules of cultured motor neurons [51]. Likewise, GFP\u2010tagged ASFV protein p54 was found associated to microtubules during infection and nocodazole treatment abrogated this association [52].",

Primary infection usually occurs at an epithelial surface, after which the virus invades the termini of sensory and autonomic neurons that innerve the infected tissue. HSV\u20101 binds to cell surface receptors, then loses its envelope after cell fusion and subsequently virion components, including the tegument and capsid layers together with the double\u2010stranded DNA, are transported in a retrograde manner along axons towards the cell bodies of these neurons [50, 53, 54]. Since simple diffusion does not allow the viral components to travel long distances, cellular microtubule\u2010based motors must be involved in alphaherpesvirus transport [31, 55]. In fact, the dynein motor is known to co\u2010localize with inbound cytosolic capsids of HSV\u20101 [34, 56], virus infection can be blocked by over\u2010expression of the dynactin subunit p50 (dynamitin) [56] and proteins from both the capsid and the tegument of HSV\u20101 are known to associate with dynein protein members. Likewise, immunofluorescence studies of pig monocytes infected with pseudorabies virus, also a member of the Alphaherpesvirinae family, showed a clear co\u2010localization with dynein [57].",

In fact recombinant capsids of HSV\u20101 were microinjected into the cytoplasm, and those decorated with VP26 showed a stronger tendency to accumulate at the nuclear envelope [61]. Besides a role of VP26 in recruiting the dynein motor, these data may also suggest that VP26 is somehow involved in binding to the nuclear pores. Nevertheless, additional HSV\u20101 proteins must associate with the dynein motor, since capsids from HSV\u20101 mutants that lack VP26 can still bind to purified dynein [62, 63]. In addition, studies with HSV\u20101 lacking VP26 have shown no significant effect on dynein\u2010dependent retrograde viral transport in cell cultures [64]. Recent results seem to indicate that both dynein (retrograde movement motor) and kinesin (anterograde movement motor) can bind isolated capsids of HSV\u20101 in vitro [62], hence raising the possibility that this association might be important for certain steps of the viral life cycle or that these two cellular motors must somehow be coordinated for viral infection to succeed [62]. Likewise, it has been reported that VP26 of pseudorabies virus is also not required for intracellular transport [65]. Finally, HSV\u20101 mutants lacking VP26 are not impaired in animal experiments that rely on axonal transport [66].",

RV is a highly neurotrophic virus that enters the organism by bites or injuries in the skin and muscle, where it replicates. It then enters the neuronal endings of peripheral nerves, such as neuromuscular junctions, to reach the central nervous system and causes lethal encephalitis in animals and humans. After receptor binding, RV enters its host cells through the endosomal pathway via a low\u2010pH\u2010induced membrane fusion process catalysed by the glycoprotein G, a major determinant for RV neuropathogenicity [67]. The retrograde transport along microtubules has been shown recently by using fluorescently labelled RV glycoprotein. Incubation of in vitro differentiated NS20Y neuroblastoma cells with fluorescently labelled virus clearly showed the transport in the retrograde direction over long distances in neurites [68].

Elegant studies by Alonso and co\u2010workers have shown that ASFV p54, a major protein of virion membranes, associates with DYNLL1, which allows the transport of the virus to the MTOC in the cell perinuclear area [78]. Fine mapping in yeast two\u2010hybrid assays, site\u2010directed mutagenesis and the presence of a polypeptide stretch in p54 with the sequence TASQT that closely resembles the DYNLL1 consensus binding motifs [25, 27] led to the identification of the DYNLL1 binding region in p54 [78, 79]. In fact, small peptide inhibitors that display this binding sequence together with an internalization sequence can disrupt the interaction between p54 and DYNLL1 altering both infectivity and the viral egress [79]. Likewise, the inhibition of the dynein\u2013dynactin complex formation by the overexpression of p50 dynamitin blocks ASFV transport in infected cells [78].

Based on immunofluorescence and co\u2010immunoprecipitation experiments, the L2 protein was found attached to microtubules after uncoating of incoming human PV pseudovirions [82].

CD155, the human poliovirus receptor, is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily, with three linked extracellular Ig\u2010like domains followed by a membrane\u2010spanning domain and a short cytoplasmic domain. Intramuscularly inoculated poliovirus is known to become incorporated into neural cells after binding to the first Ig\u2010like domain of CD155 followed by endocytosis [86, 87]. Then, the cytoplasmic domain of CD155 is known to associate to the dynein light chain DYNLT1 [86, 88] and subsequently the endosomes, together with the CD155\u2010bound poliovirus, undergo retrograde transport along microtubules through the axon to the neural\u2010cell body, where the uncoating and replication of poliovirus occur [51, 87].",

Initial reports concluded that depolymerization of cell microtubules with nocodazole had little effect on virus infection whereas actin depolymerization had a profound effect on infection [91]. Subsequent studies used a GFP\u2010tagged Vpr incorporated into virions and in vivo fluorescence to show a microtubule\u2010dependent transport towards the MTOC positioned in perinuclear areas [39]. Interestingly, the individual treatment of infected cells with either nocodazole or the F\u2010actin inhibitor latranculin B did not impede the movement of GFP\u2010labelled particles, whereas the simultaneous treatment with both compounds led to a cessation of movement. This suggests that HIV movement inside the cell depends on both actin and the microtubule network.

Both of these small proteins are homodimers and structurally consist of two \u03b1\u2010helices followed by five \u03b2\u2010strands, with the second \u03b2\u2010strand being swapped between protomers. The proteins that bind to either DYNLL1 or DYNLT1 do so through polypeptide stretches that adopt an extended \u03b2\u2010strand conformation that inserts into the ligand binding grooves. The consensus protein sequence necessary for binding to dynein light chain DYNLT1 is not well known. However, numerous atomic coordinates are available for dynein light chain DYNLL1 in association with protein partners, and in all cases GIQVD or KXTQT motifs, or variations of them, are inserted into the DYNLL1 binding grove [24, 25, 27, 108]. Using yeast two\u2010hybrid and mutagenesis experiments, the binding region to DYNLL1 has been narrowed to TASQT for ASFV p54 [78] and KSTQT and KSIQI in the case of the P protein of rabies and Mokola viruses respectively [70, 71] and SQTQT in the case of protein VP35 of ebolavirus [103]. The presence of these sequences that closely resemble the KXTQT motif in various viral proteins [28] suggests that virus association also occurs with the viral protein adopting an extended antiparallel \u03b2 strand that fits into the DYNLL1 groove and extends the pre\u2010existing \u03b2\u2010sheet. The atomic coordinates of the modeled ASFV p54\u2013DYNLL1 complex clearly indicate that this is indeed the case [26]. In fact, RV P protein and the pro\u2010apoptotic Bcl\u20102 family member Bim display an identical DYNLL1 binding sequence (DKSTQT) and the published NMR structure of the DYNLL1\u2013Bim complex also shows the \u03b2\u2010sheet augmentation mode of binding [18].",

DYNLL1 is a bivalent molecule and many of its interacting partners are dimeric (or oligomeric) proteins [20]. However, linking cargo molecules to dynein is not easily reconciled with binding data [109]. In fact, DYNLL1 binding affinity for a dimeric partner is significantly higher compared with the same partner as a monomer [19, 20]. This observation has led to the hypothesis that two identical polypeptide segments from a dimeric partner occupy both of the binding grooves of DYNLL1 and DYNLT1. If this is the case, it is hard to accept that one DYNLL1 binding site is occupied by a viral protein whereas the other is occupied by the dynein intermediate chain as would be required for retrograde transport. Although this is theoretically possible, binding of a viral polypeptide to either DYNLL1 or DYNLT1 would require the displacement of the dynein intermediate chain from one of the binding sites, which is a thermodynamically unfavourable process. In this regard, it must be mentioned that, for instance, in the case of DYNLT1, peptides from the intermediate chain compete with the G protein \u03b2 subunit [110], an indication that both peptides bind at the same location and therefore DYNLT1 cannot be simultaneously binding to both proteins. Therefore, if the DYNLL1 dimer (and by analogy the DYNLT1 dimer) binds to either two chains of the dynein intermediate chain or two chains of putative cargo proteins at the same location, how can viruses be transported in a retrograde manner towards the minus end of microtubules associated to the dynein motor?",

The development of microscopy techniques has also enabled the retrograde movement of viruses in the cellular cytoplasm to be tracked. In addition, the in vitro binding and transport assays using complete viral capsids and intact microtubule motors may be instrumental in further characterizing potential functions of the interactions between dynein light chains and viral proteins. Moreover, several viral polypeptides are known to associate to dynein light chains, although many of them do not belong to capsid proteins. However, dynein light chains appear also as homodimers in the cellular cytoplasm, without being part of the dynein motor. Therefore, it remains to be unambiguously established if the interaction of viral polypeptides with dynein light chains links the virion to the dynein motor when bound to microtubules and if this interaction is responsible for the observed viral retrograde transport. Hence, co\u2010immunoprecipitation of dynein intermediate or heavy chains bound to incoming virions would be an adequate experiment to prove that the interaction of certain viral polypeptides with dynein light chains does indeed link virions to microtubules via the dynein motor. Since DYNLL1 (and probably DYNLT1) work as dimerization clamps that bind to intrinsically disordered regions of proteins it is also conceivable that the dimerization of viral polypeptides might be important for certain viral infective processes distinct from retrograde transport. This might be the case of the interaction of DYNLL1 with the phosphoproteins of RV, Mokola virus and ebolavirus. On the other hand, a conundrum therefore exists in that certain envelope or capsid viral proteins bind to dynein light chains at the same site used by dynein intermediate chain. Thus, whether the binding of viral proteins to dynein light chains displaces dynein intermediate chain and how it is performed remains to be established.",

This is in agreement with the modeled solution structure of the complex of DYNLL1 with p54 of ASFV [26]. (B) Three hypotheses for the association of viral proteins to the dynein molecular motor. One viral polypeptide displaces a dynein intermediate chain from one binding side of the DYNLL homodimer (a). Two DYNLL homodimers associate to one dynein intermediate chain and to one viral polypeptide simultaneously (b). Binding of the viral polypeptides displaces the dynein intermediate chains from the DYNLL binding grooves but DYNLL remains part of the dynein motor through the binding to the dynein heavy chain (red) (c).",
