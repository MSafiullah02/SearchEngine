The present study builds on the recently developed \"Fear of COVID-19 Scale\" (Ahorsu et al., In International Journal of Mental Health and Addiction, https://doi.org/10.1007/s11469-020-00270-8, 2020). The sample comprised of 850 participants, male and female young adults from Russia and Belarus. The majority of survey participants are university students and graduates. Females, students, and others from Russia report higher levels of COVID-19-related fear than those from Belarus. Respondents from Russia and Belarus report less fear than people from Iran who were surveyed earlier. The scale used for the present survey evidenced a good Cronbach's Alpha measure of internal consistency or reliability (0.809). Clearly, further research is needed across locations and over time about the nature and extent of fear caused by COVID 19. Overall, the FCV-19S appears to be a valuable and brief instrument that may provide useful information for intervention and policy purposes to migrate fear and problem behavior linked to infectious disease outbreaks.",

Drawing on the international network of contacts working with the Ben Gurion University of the Negev -Regional Alcohol and Drug Abuse Research (RADAR) Center, colleagues from Russia and Belarus were asked about possible interest in the scale. Translated to Russian and sent online to students, university faculty members, and friends, and in 48 h, the number of responses received to the FCV-19S was impressive considering government officials' initial dismissiveness of COVID-19.

Clearly, the results of this study evidence the variation of fear by gender, religion, religiosity, academic status, and country factors. These results are preliminary, taken at one point in time across two countries in Eastern Europe-Russia and Belarus. Scale results from Iran and those from Russia and Belarus were collected at different times where government responses to COVID-19 vary along with the nature of public information available about the infectious disease. Therefore, caution should be exercised regarding comparisons and conclusions about COVID-19 fear and its impact. The authors of the FCV-19S (Ahorsu et al. 2020) are to be commended for their efforts to develop a simple, short, and valid survey instrument-an important, timely, and highly relevant undertaking. The useful information generated by FCV-19S should be used in applied ways. For example, the findings may be relevant for online training of trainers who, in turn, may work with others to help prevent or reduce COVID-19 fear, stress, and anxiety causing problem behavior such as harmful substance use, domestic violence, and crime. Also, sources of information (e.g., tips sheets on helpful ways of coping) disseminated online or by other means should be considered for intervention purposes. Clearly, future research is needed, across locations and over time, to learn more about the utility of the FCV-19S for intervention and policy purposes.",
