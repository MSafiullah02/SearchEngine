            "text": "Gay saunas operate quite openly in China\u2014information and addresses are available in most of the Chinese gay websites and are known to the majority of MSM. Some countries, excluding China, have established policies governing gay saunas or have house rules within saunas to reduce the chance of having high\u2010risk behaviors occurring on\u2010site [22]. Prevention efforts targeting gay saunas in China are at the preliminary stage. In some individual cities in China, limited but sporadic outreach work in gay saunas has been provided by some peer MSM health educators. Nevertheless, there are studies showing that condom availability is a factor associated with UAI taking place in gay saunas 12, 23, 24. Previous studies also showed that the high risk of HIV transmission exist while cruising in parks 25, 26. Very few studies have systematically compared HIV/STD prevalence among MSM according to key venue type for sourcing sex partners 4, 27, although there are a number of studies reporting variations in HIV/STD prevalence according to where the survey took place 20, 21, 28. There are in fact two different types of studies regarding gay venues\u2014those investigating variations by site of partner sourcing and those investigating variations by site of data collection. Regarding the latter, a respondent recruited from a bar, for instance, may also go to saunas or other gay venues so that the interpretation is less specific than it sounds. It is important to find out whether having gay sauna and/or other gay venues as the main sites for sourcing sex partners is going to catalyze HIV/STD transmissions in China. The results have important policy and programming implications.",

After pretest counseling, a 5 mL blood specimen was taken from the participants for HIV and syphilis testing. Following a face\u2010to\u2010face interview, participants were informed about the results of the HIV rapid testing, and posttest counseling was provided to them thereafter. Those showing an HIV\u2010positive rapid test result were asked to return to the CDC in person after 2 weeks to receive the confirmatory result by the method of Western Blot test. Those with confirmed HIV\u2010positive status received additional posttest counseling and were referred to receive HIV\u2010related services. Participants were informed about the syphilis testing result within 2 weeks by phone. Those who tested positive for syphilis were referred to receive relevant treatments and services.

Applying Bonferroni adjustment to the data would mean that we should reject the null hypothesis of no difference only when the P value is lower than about 0.0083. The significant results from the comparisons of HIV prevalence between the cases of saunas vs. bars and saunas vs. Internet remained significant, although the comparisons of syphilis prevalence would not meet this stringent adjustment. Another important limitation of the study was related to the way of asking the question about venues of sourcing male sex partners. Participants were requested to give a single answer of the most frequently used venue for sourcing male sex partners. For some participants, there might be two equally frequently used venues. Multiple venues could have been used but the role of the other venues could not be analyzed as such information was not available in the surveys of this meta\u2010analysis. Furthermore, the 10 cities did not cover the whole of China although efforts have been made to cover different parts of China. We need to pay attention to the representativeness of the 10 cities when interpreting the results. Gay saunas exist in almost all 61 cities and are important venues for sourcing male sex partners among MSM all over China. Even the 61 cities could not truly represent the entire China, especially the smaller cities and towns. The 10 cities covered a large population (over 8% of the national population). The results are hence important but they may overrepresent the larger cities in China.",
