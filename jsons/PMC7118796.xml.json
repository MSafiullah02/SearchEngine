The open discovery systems (ODS) component of LRD starts with an unsolved problem, and generates solutions to that problem through potential discovery. ODS LRD has been used to identify potential treatments or preventative actions for challenging medical problems, among myriad other applications. The closed discovery systems (CDS) component of LRD starts with an unsolved problem and a potential solution, and generates potential mechanisms that link the solution to the problem. ODS is the only approach that will be used for the present study.",

A major challenge is to select those combinations of potential discoveries that provide the maximum synergy. Until these potential discoveries have been exploited, there is little practical need of going to indirectly related literatures to search for yet more potential discovery. In the practical situation, even the potential innovation as defined above has not been exploited, and accelerating these potential innovations should be the first order of business [55], [56], [57], [58], [59].",

To enhance the volume of potential discovery, a full text database was used in contrast to previous work. Because of the richness of the full text, \u2018surgical\u2019 queries were developed that targeted the exact types of potential discovery of interest while eliminating clutter more efficiently. The \u2018surgical\u2019 nature of these queries compensated for the additional \u2018noise\u2019 characteristic of the more voluminous full text. However, since the full text database (Science Direct-SD) did not have an associated MeSH taxonomy, the MeSH taxonomy headings were essentially used as text phrases to restrict SARS treatment and prevention potential discoveries to selected substances. The Science Citation Index (SCI) was also used to search for discovery, and again the MeSH taxonomy headings were used as text phrases to restrict potential discoveries to selected substances. Approximately four times as many records were retrieved from Medline when MeSH terms were included in the query compared to using only terms in the title or Abstract, due to the greater choice of potential discovery substances. This means the SCI or SD queries as presently constituted will retrieve only about 25% of the records that are possible using MeSH to define the substance pool.",

The appearance of SARS seems to have involved: 1) a zoonotic origin for SARS-CoV (e.g., horseshoe bats and/or Chiroptera as one wildlife reservoir [7]); 2) transmission to intermediate hosts (e.g., civet cats, raccoon dogs [8]); 3) human contact with these intermediate hosts in Southern China [Guangdong Province, Fall 2002] and subsequent cross-species transmission of the coronavirus to humans [8]; 4) transmission of the virus through both non-hospital personal contact and hospital staff contact [9]; and, 5) global transmission of the virus via travelers from affected regions in Asia to other countries.

In the present application, a somewhat different approach was taken. Since the characteristics of those who had succumbed to SARS tended to be sub-optimal performance of different immune system components, the query combined the immune system components at a higher aggregation level with functional terminology designed to improve this performance (e.g., enhance humoral immunity). Such a query structure allowed a large number of potential discovery candidates to be identified. As the previous paragraph shows, much more is possible in terms of potential discovery volume.",
