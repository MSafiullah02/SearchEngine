            "text": "Information on viruses occurring in poikilothermic vertebrates is still behind the knowledge of viruses of homoiothermic vertebrates. About 30 years ago, very little was known about viruses and viral diseases of fish, amphibians and reptiles. However, the maintenance of viruses in lower vertebrates proved to be of veterinarian and public interest, especially RNA viruses causing severe diseases in fish aquaculture that became of worldwide economical importance. Some DNA viruses also induce diseases resulting in important economic losses in fish farms, such as channel catfish herpesvirus disease and epizootic haematopoietic necrosis. In addition, herpesviruses such as green sea turtle fibropapillomatosis virus and frog iridoviruses might be responsible for losses in wildlife affecting endangered species. However, some of these DNA viruses have been used as models for studying disease mechanisms. For example, the Luck\u00e9 tumour herpesvirus of frogs increased knowledge of the formation of tumours and metastases. Also, adenoviruses of lower vertebrates could be used as vectors for gene therapy or as vaccine vectors in aquaculture. An increased number of studies on viruses of lower vertebrates have been undertaken in recent years, giving greater insight into the biology and characteristics of these viral agents. During the last 20 years understanding of the virology of lower vertebrates has been substantially improved. The following review, divided into virus families, comprises an overview of the present knowledge on RNA (Figs 1 and 2) and DNA viruses (Figs 8 and 9, p. 431, 432) of lower vertebrates. Classification and nomenclature of the viruses described is based on the Seventh Report of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (van Regenmortel et al., 2000). Target viruses of fish, amphibians and reptiles are isolated and identified according to standard virological procedures. In contrast to the viruses of homoiothermic animals, viruses of poikilothermic animals usually replicate below 30\u00b0C in several cell cultures derived from fish (examples in Table 1, p. 406), amphibians or reptiles. Such cell lines are available from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), 12301 Parklawn Drive, Rockville, MD 20852\u20131776, USA (http://www.atcc.org) and from the European Collection of Cell Cultures, Centre for Applied Microbiology and Research, Salisbury, Wiltshire SP4 OJG, UK (http://www.ecacc.org.uk). However, some of the viruses of poikilothermic vertebrates replicate in avian and mammalian cell cultures at temperatures below 30\u00b0C. The fish disease commission of the Office International des Epizooties (OIE), 12 rue de Prony, 75017 Paris, France (http://www.oie.int), elaborated for fish diseases the International Aquatic Health Code (OIE, 2001). \u2018Diseases notifiable to the OIE\u2019 (previously \u2018List B diseases\u2019) are considered to be of socio\u2010economic and/or public health importance within countries, and significant to the international trade in aquatic animals and aquatic animal products. \u2018Other significant diseases\u2019 are of current or potential international significance in aquaculture. The Code includes six notifiable or significant fish pathogenic RNA viruses: Orthomyxoviridae\u2013 infectious salmon anaemia virus (ISAV); Rhabdoviridae\u2013 infectious haematopoietic necrosis virus (IHNV), spring viraemia of carp virus (SVCV), viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus (VHSV); Nodaviridae\u2013 nervous necrosis virus (NNV), and Birnaviridae\u2013 infectious pancreatic necrosis virus (IPNV). The Code includes also five notifiable or significant fish pathogenic DNA viruses: Iridoviridae\u2013 epizootic haematopoietic necrosis virus (EHNV), red sea bream iridovirus (RSIV), white sturgeon iridovirus (WSIV); Herpesviridae\u2013 Oncorhynchus masou virus (OMV; salmonid herpesvirus 2, SaHV\u20102), and channel catfish herpesvirus (CCHV). Table 1 gives an overview of virus isolation and identification of these viruses according to the International Aquatic Animal Health Code and Diagnostic Manual for Aquatic Animal Diseases, copies of which are available from the OIE. Some representative viruses of lower vertebrates are shown in Figs 2 and 9.",

            "text": "An orthomyxovirus has been isolated from Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) in Norway suffering from infectious salmon anaemia (ISA) (Falk et al., 1997). ISA, caused by infectious salmon anaemia virus (ISAV), has been recognized as a notifiable disease in Norway since 1988. In 1996, ISA cases were reported in Canada (Mullins et al., 1998). There ISAV was found to also be associated with haemorrhagic kidney syndrome (HKS) in Atlantic salmon (Lovely et al., 1999). Two years later, ISA was detected in Scotland (Rodger et al., 1998). ISAV causes severe economic losses of Atlantic salmon. Sea trout, rainbow trout and Atlantic herring are also susceptible and may function as reservoirs of the virus. The systemic infection can be lethal and is characterized by anaemia, ascites, congestion and enlargement of the liver and spleen. The virus is transmitted by sea lice (Caligus elongatus, Lepeophtheirus salmonis) and via coprophagy (Rolland and Nylund, 1998). It does not seem to be transmitted vertically (Melville and Griffiths, 1999). OIE guidelines and directive 93/53 of the European Community do not include details on confirmation of the virus (IFAT, PCR) and the activities necessary during outbreaks (eradication). ISAV multiplies in salmon head kidney cells (SHK\u20101) and in chinook salmon embryo cells (CHSE\u2010214) at 15\u00b0C (Dannevig et al., 1995; Bouchard et al., 1999; Kibenge et al., 2000). Sialic acid residues on the cell surface function as binding sites and fusion of the virus takes place in the acidic endosomes (Eliassen et al., 2000). Actinomycin D inhibits the viral replication in vitro. ISAV is sensitive to chloroform, heat and low pH. The virus has a buoyant density of 1.18 g/ml in sucrose and caesium chloride gradients. ISAV contains four major polypeptides of 71, 53, 43 and 24 kDa (Falk et al., 1997). The genome (14.5 kb) of ISAV consists of eight RNA segments of 1.0\u20132.3 kb (Mjaaland et al., 1997). Viral RNA termini resemble those of influenzaviruses in both their sequences and secondary structures. These features indicate replication mechanisms similar to other orthomyxoviruses (Sandvik et al., 2000). Genomic comparison of ISAV\u2010isolates from Europe (Norway, Scotland) and North America (Canada) suggests distinct geographical variants (Blake et al., 1999; Cunningham and Snow, 2000). Phenotypic differences have been found among ISAV strains (Kibenge et al., 2000). Nucleotide sequence of segments 2 and 8 of ISAV demonstrated the separation of European and Canadian ISAV strains and revealed no homogenicity between European strains (Inglis et al., 2000). Analysis of the polymerase (PB1) protein (encoded in segment 2) showed low sequence similarity to other orthomyxoviruses. Phylogenetic analysis revealed significant distance between ISAV and the established genera of Orthomyxoviridae. ISAV possibly represents a species of the proposed genus Aquaorthomyxovirus of Orthomyxoviridae (Krossoy et al., 1999). ISA is an OIE significant disease (OIE, 2001).",

The chloroform\u2010sensitive agent has a buoyant density of 1.20 g/ml in caesium chloride gradients and haemagglutinates erythrocytes of fish, birds and mammals. The virus replicates in several fish cell lines at 18\u00b0C. The aetiological role of the isolate is not known (Winton et al., 1985). Paramyxovirus\u2010like particles (100\u2013300 nm) have been isolated from rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and pike (Esox lucius).

A virus (FDLV) with properties characteristic of Paramyxoviridae was isolated from the lung tissue of a dead Fer\u2010de\u2010Lance.

The antigenically related viruses induce syncytia formation in infected cells and haemagglutinate erythrocytes. Affected animals usually show proliferative pneumonia; some snakes exhibit severe pancreatic necrosis and nervous symptoms. Several die\u2010offs associated with paramyxoviruses involving snakes in collections have been reported (Jacobson, 1986). The pleomorphic virions measure between 30 and 560 nm in diameter, have a helical nucleocapsid and carry an envelope with spikes, e.g. transmembrane glycoproteins with neuraminidase and haemagglutinating activities. The viral nucleocapsid is composed of one molecule of ssRNA associated with proteins. Viral polypeptides have been identified as polymerase (L\u2010, P\u2010), haemaglutinin (HN\u2010), nucleoprotein (NP\u2010), fusion (F\u2010), and matrix (M\u2010) proteins. The viruses are sensitive to ether and to acidic (pH 5) and basic (pH 12) conditions. Virion buoyant density in sucrose is 1.18 g/cm3. No cross\u2010reactivity of OPMV with the paramyxoviruses of homoiothermic vertebrates has been recognized (Richter et al., 1996). Protein migration patterns of the snake viruses are similar in PAGE, but they are different from those of Sendai virus. Immunoblotting does not show any antigenic relationship to Sendai virus, mumps virus, measles virus, or influenzaviruses A and B (Ahne et al., 1987a; Ahne and Neubert, 1989). However, haemagglutination inhibition tests have revealed an antigenic relationship between the ophidian paramyxoviruses isolated from snakes (Colubridae, Crotalidae, Elapidae, Viperidae) in Germany and avian paramyxoviruses serotypes 1 and 7 (Blahak, 1995). Comparative sequence analysis of partial HN\u2010 and L\u2010gene of 15 OPMV and the FDLV has revealed two major genomic subgroups. The subgroups represent distinct virus species (nucleotide divergence values of 20\u201322%) containing multiple virus strains. The phylogenetic grouping reflects correlation with geographical origin of the viruses (Fig. 3) (Ahne et al., 1999). FDLV is listed as an \u2018unassigned virus\u2019 in the family Paramyxoviridae; the other reptilian paramyxoviruses are presently not recognized by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) (van Regenmortel et al., 2000).",

The age of fish influences the course of the infection: the younger the fish the more susceptible they are to the disease. Survivors developed IHNV\u2010neutralizing antibodies leading to protective immunity. The transmission of IHNV takes place horizontally, vertically, and by biological vectors such as fish parasites (Piscicola salmositica, Salmincola sp.) and carrier fish (Wolf, 1988; Mulcahy et al., 1990). Acutely infected fish release the virus by faeces, urine and external mucus. Carriers shed the agent via sexual products. Truncated IHNV particles, detected in persistently infected rainbow trout, proved to be mediators of persistence of the virus (Kim et al., 1999). IHNV, the type species of the genus Novirhabdovirus, was enzootic in North America for decades, but the agent has been spread to the Far East and continental Europe. IHNV epizootics occur usually in young Salmoniformes, but Acipenseriformes, Pleuronectiformes and Perciformes are also susceptible to the virus (Winton, 1992). A DNA vaccine containing the gene for the glycoprotein (G) induced protective immunity and neutralizing antibodies in rainbow trout fry (Corbeil et al., 2000). IHNV shares physicochemical characteristics of Rhabdoviridae. Like other mononegavirales it has a single molecule of linear, negative\u2010sense ssRNA genome (11.1 kb). The viral genome contains six genes (N\u2010, P\u2010, M\u2010, G\u2010, NV\u2010, and L\u2010genes) located from 3\u2032 to 5\u2032 (Kurath et al., 1985). The gene junction regions show conserved sequences including transcription\u2010termination/polyadenylation and transcription\u2010initiation signals. The IHNV sequence does not contain the transcription start consensus UUGU present in vesiculovirus and rabies virus (Morzunov et al., 1995; Kurath et al., 1997). Forty\u2010two Alaskan IHNV isolates of different hosts were found to have only low genetic diversity (3\u20135%) (Emmenegger et al., 2000), but IHNV in rainbow trout aquaculture revealed unusually high genetic diversity as detected by RNase protection assay and nucleotide sequence analysis. Four distinct monophyletic clades were observed during phylogenetic analysis of 84 IHNV isolates (Troyer et al., 2000). IHNV observed in Europe and IHNV strains in North America represent two different genotypes (Arkush et al., 1989). Diagnosis of IHNV is based on direct methods, e.g. isolation (EPC\u2010cells) and identification (NT, IFAT, ELISA, PCR and DNA probes) of virus or the demonstration of IHNV antigen in infected tissue. Detection of IHNV antibodies is not accepted for assessing the viral status of fish populations (OIE, 2001). Biotinylated oligonucleotide probes are successfully used for identification of IHNV (Deering et al., 1991). At least two functions for the M\u2010protein in an IHNV infection were suggested: the down\u2010regulation of host transcription and the induction of programmed cell death (Chiou et al., 2000). IHN is listed as an OIE notifiable disease.",

            "text": "Viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus (VHSV) is the aetiological agent of viral haemorrhagic septicaemia (VHS), a well\u2010known important viral disease in European rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) aquaculture (Wolf, 1988). VHSV shows the typical morphology and characteristics of Rhabdoviridae. This rhabdovirus is responsible for high mortality rates (90\u2013100%) occurring usually among juvenile fish in trout aquaculture at 4\u201314\u00b0C. The virus possesses a wide host spectrum infecting several freshwater and marine fishes (Anguilliformes, Clupeiformes, Cypriniformes, Gadiformes, Perciformes, Pleuronectiformes and Salmoniformes). Multiplication of the virus takes place in endothelial cells of blood capillaries (leading to haemorrhagic lesions in internal organs and musculature), leucocytes, haematopoietic tissues and nephron cells. Infected fish are lethargic or hyperactive. They may show exophthalmia and bleeding in the skin and fin bases (Fig. 4). Infection of fish is mostly lethal due to impairment of osmotic balance. Clinically infected fish and VHSV carriers are reservoirs of the virus, which is shed by faeces, urine and sexual fluids. VHSV induces interferon in the early stage of infection (de Kinkelin and Dorson, 1973). Survivors are resistant to reinfection due to the development of neutralizing antibodies (Jorgensen, 1971). The transmembrane viral G\u2010protein functions as target molecule for neutralizing antibodies (Lorenzen et al., 1990). The rainbow trout gene vig\u20101 (gene number 1 expressed in spleen and head kidney) is activated during VHSV infection and leads to inactivation of the virus. The vig\u20101 gene may be induced by interferon or directly by the viral G\u2010protein (Boudinot et al., 1999). VHSV occurred exclusively in Europe for decades, but in 1988 VHSV was detected in salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha, O. kisutch) native to the Pacific Northwest returning to hatcheries in Washington located near the open ocean. Molecular analysis proved that North American VHSV strains were not of European origin (Meyers and Winton, 1995). The North American VHSV strain is enzootic in the north\u2010eastern Pacific Ocean among herring and cod. The virus shows high pathogenicity for Pacific herring (Clupea harengus pallasi) (Kocan et al., 1997). In 1998 thousands of dead Pacific herring, Pacific hake (Merluccius productus) and walleye pollock (Theragra chalcogramma) were found in Alaska, having been infected by the American strain of VHS (Meyers et al., 1999). VHSV was isolated from several marine fishes (Clupea harengus, Sprattus sprattus, Gadus morhua, Rhinonemus cimbrius, Trisopterus esmarkii, Micromesistius poutassou, Merlangius merlangus, Argentina sphyraena) in the Baltic Sea, Kattegat, Skagerrak and North Sea (Mortensen et al., 1999). An RNase protection assay based on the N\u2010gene sequence data of 39 VHSV isolates from fish in European marine environments identified 10 distinct groups of viruses within three genotypes (Snow et al., 1999). The observations suggest that VHSV isolates of marine origin are usually highly virulent for marine fish, but less virulent or avirulent for freshwater fish (Meyers et al., 1999). VHS outbreaks in farmed turbot (Scophthalmus maximus) in Scotland have been reported (Ross et al., 1994).",

The European and American strains of VHSV can be clearly distinguished at the genomic level (Batts et al., 1993; Benmansour et al., 1997). Sequences of the glycoprotein genes of several European and North American VHSV strains show that VHSV displays overall genetic diversity correlating with geographical origin. The phylogeny based on nucleotide sequence data separates the VHSV strains in three genotypes, e.g. genotype I for continental Europe, genotype II for the British Isles, and genotype III for North America. However, neutralizing antibodies directed against the G\u2010protein are not able to discriminate between the genotypes. The VHSV strains of genotype I have been assigned to four serotypes that correlate partially with the genetic variability of isolates from continental Europe (Benmansour et al., 1997). Diagnosis of VHSV is based on direct methods, e.g. isolation (BF\u20102, RTG\u20102 cells) and identification (NT, IFAT, ELISA) of the virus. Carriers might be identified by fish serology, but this has yet to be validated (OIE, 2001). VHS is listed as an OIE notifiable disease.",

Rhabdovirus olivaceus), an important pathogen of Japanese flounder, has been isolated from moribund hirame (Paralichthys olivaceus) and ayu (Plecoglossus altivelis) in Japan (Kimura et al., 1986). Several teleost fishes (Perciformes, Pleuronectiformes, Salmoniformes and Scorpaeniformes) have proved to be susceptible to HIRRV. Infected fish exhibit haemorrhages in fins, musculature and internal organs, and necrosis of haematopoietic tissue. Japanese flounder infected with HIRRV exhibited an increased expression of Mx (myxovirus resistance) mRNA in leucocytes and the tissue of internal organs (Lee et al., 2000). Mx is an interferon\u2010induced protein that prevents replication of viruses in vivo and in vitro. An interferon regulatory factor (fIRF) of HIRRV\u2010infected flounder has been cloned. The cDNA with 1746 bp (with an open reading frame coding for 297 amino acids) showed 40% identity with mammalian IRF\u20101s and IRF\u20102s (Yabu et al., 1998). Using cDNAs (up\u2010regulated in HIRRV\u2010infected Ig + leucocytes of cloned Japanese flounder), differential hybridization and cloning strategies, several immune\u2010related genes for biodefence were identified (Aoki et al., 2000). HIRRV is composed of a negative\u2010sense ssRNA encoding five structural proteins. The structural HIRRV proteins reveal similarity to those of IHNV and VHSV (Nishizawa et al., 1991). Comparison of the N\u2010, P\u2010 and M\u2010gene sequences of HIRRV with the corresponding sequences of IHNV and VHSV indicates a close relationship, but HIRRV is more closely related to IHNV (71.3%) than to VHSV (45.4%) (Nishizawa et al., 1997a).",

The red spot disease (RSD) of fish in Australia is indistinguishable from EUS. Two rhabdoviruses, the ulcerative disease rhabdovirus (UDRV) isolated from freshwater eel (Fluta alba) (Frerichs et al., 1986), and the snakehead rhabdovirus (SHRV) isolated from snakehead fish (Ophicephalus striatus) (Wattanavavijarn et al., 1986), have been obtained during seasonal EUS in Thailand. UDRV and SHRV can be distinguished by serology and their structural polypeptides. Both viruses are serologically unrelated to the other known fish rhabdoviruses (Ahne et al., 1988). Phylogenetic analysis of the SHRV G\u2010protein suggests the classification of SHRV into the genus Novirhabdovirus (Johnson et al., 1999). However, the role of UDRV and SHRV as the aetiological agents of EUS is uncertain. During an epizootic less than 5% of examined fish have proved to be positive for the rhabdovirus. Furthermore, experimental infection of snakehead with EUS rhabdoviruses has not induced any lesions indicative of EUS. In conclusion, there is not adequate evidence for the viral aetiology of EUS, but it is now accepted that an invasive fungus (Aphanomyces invaderis, A. piscicida) infection plays the role of main pathogen in EUS (Frerichs, 1995). However, the EUS is listed as an OIE notifiable disease. Its diagnosis is based on the clinical signs, histopathology and evidence of the fungus Aphanomyces (OIE, 2001).",

            "text": "Spring viraemia of carp virus (SVCV) is the causative agent of spring viraemia of carp (SVC), a haemorrhagic disease that predominantly affects common carp (Cyprinus carpio) in European aquaculture. The geographical range of SVC is limited to aquatic environments where temperatures decline during the winter. The outbreaks usually occur in springtime, when water temperature rises (11\u201317\u00b0C). The SVCV is shed via faeces, urine and sexual fluids, and is transmitted by contact and by animate vectors (Argulus foliaceus, Piscicola geometra) (Fig. 7, p. 430) (Ahne, 1985a). After fish have taken up the virus, it is disseminated within a few days in the body of infected carp (Fig. 5, p. 416) (Ahne, 1978a). Multiplication of the virus takes place in endothelial cells of blood capillaries, haematopoietic tissue and nephron cells. Clinical signs of SVCV are external and internal haemorrhages, peritonitis and ascites (Fijan, 1972). An SVCV infection can be lethal because of impairment of the salt\u2010water balance. The virus has a wide host spectrum, infecting mainly Cypriniformes but also Atheriformes, Salmoniformes and Crustacea (Fijan, 1972; Wolf, 1988; Johnson et al., 1999; Stone et al., 2001). Survivors develop a strong protective immunity associated with circulating antibodies. The SVCV possesses bullet\u2010shaped morphology, measuring 60\u201390 \u00d7 90\u2013180 nm. The buoyant density of SVCV is 1.195\u20131.200 g/cm3 caesium chloride. The virion has an inner nucleocapsid consisting of an RNA protein (L, N and P) complex of about 50 nm in diameter, and it is surrounded by a lipid\u2010containing envelope with spikes. The viral genome consists of one molecule of non\u2010infectious linear ssRNA, which sediments in a sucrose gradient at 38\u201340 S (Hill et al., 1975). The viral RNA encodes five structural proteins, the L\u2010protein (90\u2013190 kDa), the G\u2010protein (70\u201388 kDa), the P\u2010protein (43\u201353 kDa), the N\u2010protein (40\u201352 kDa), and the M\u2010protein (19\u201372 kDa) (Clerx, 1978; Roy et al., 1984). The SVCV L\u2010protein is an RNA\u2010dependent RNA polymerase, with functions in transcription and replication at its optimal temperature for activity of 20\u201325\u00b0C (Roy and Cleweley, 1978). A comparison of partial nucleotide sequences of the L\u2010gene of SVCV with other rhabdoviruses of vertebrates shows the closest relationship with vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), the type species of the genus Vesiculovirus of Rhabdoviridae. The L\u2010protein (1780 amino acids) has an identity of 57% and a similarity of 72% to that of VSV, but low identity (21%) and similarity (42%) to IHNV (Bj\u00f6rklund et al., 1995). The SVCV G\u2010gene consists of 1588 nucleotides (with a poly\u2010A tail) encoding 509 amino acids that form the 57 kDa G\u2010protein. The G\u2010gene reveals sequence identity of 31\u201333% and sequence similarity of 51\u201353% with VSV (Bj\u00f6rklund et al., 1996). The G\u2010gene of a penaeid shrimp SVCV\u2010like rhabdovirus isolated in Hawaii has been proved to be over 99% identical to the G\u2010gene nucleotide sequence of SVCV (Johnson et al., 1999). The G\u2010protein is responsible for the induction of neutralizing antibodies in infected animals and gives rise to the development of antibodies in infected fish (Ahne, 1986). In phylogenetic analysis SVCV is grouped in the genus Vesiculovirus (Bj\u00f6rklund et al., 1996). A ribonuclease protection assay using a 32P\u2010labelled RNA probe made from a cloned copy of the full\u2010length SVCV glycoprotein gene was able to distinguish between several SVCV isolates. Autoradiography has revealed identical cleavage patterns of RNA in viruses obtained from the same location, whereas a number of mismatches are evident in RNA from viruses from different locations (Ahne et al., 1998a). Seminested PCR (Liu et al., 1998), hybridization with DNA probes and amplification by PCR (Oreshkova et al., 1999) have been used as molecular detection methods for SVCV. SVC is an OIE notifiable disease. The diagnosis of SVCV is based on direct methods; the virus can be isolated by using EPC or FHM cells at 20\u00b0C. Virus identification is carried out by neutralization tests, indirect fluorescence antibody tests or enzyme\u2010linked immunosorbent assays. The detection of fish antibodies is not accepted for assessing the viral status of fish populations (OIE, 2001). SVCV induces apoptosis in EPC\u2010cells that can be inhibited by human endogenous acid cysteine proteinase inhibitor (Bj\u00f6rklund et al., 1997).",

The malignant neoplasm has been found with seasonal periodicity in pike with cutaneous lesions. An investigation of the DNA polymerase from necropsies of tumour\u2010bearing pike has revealed an optimum temperature profile of 20\u00b0C (Papas et al., 1977).

Walleye (Stizostedion vitreum) has for many years shown high incidence (27%) of sarcomatous lesions associated with retroviruses in North America (walleye dermal sarcoma virus, WDSV). The virus does not integrate and tumours do not metastasize (Martineau et al., 1991). Retrovirus particles with RT activity have been found in homogenates of the walleye dermal sarcoma. Isolated viral RNA (12 kb) hybridized with a 13\u2010kb viral DNA present in DNA of walleye tumours. Lairmore et al. (2000) reported that the D\u2010cyclin homologue (retroviral (rv) cyclin) is encoded by WDSV and the cyclin mRNA is present in developing tumours. The rv\u2010cyclin seems to plays an important role in the development of walleye dermal sarcoma. Furthermore, a plasmacytoid leukaemia (PL) of chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) has been suggested to be of oncovirus origin. Evidence of the retrovirus aetiology of plasmacytoid leukaemia comes from reverse transcriptase activity in affected tissue, visualization of retrovirus\u2010like particles by electron microscopy, or transmission of the disease. Skin tumours of hooknose (Agonus cataphractus) have contained lentivirus\u2010like particles of 86\u2013132 nm. C\u2010type particles have been observed in epidermal papillomatosis of European smelt (Osmerus eperlanus). A dual infection of bluegills (Lepomis macrochirus) with retrovirus and lymphocystis virus has been reported. Cell cultures derived from three species of warm\u2010water fishes (Ophicephalus striatus, Anabas testudineus, Trichogaster pectoralis) and from neoplastic embryonic tissues of the platyfish (Xiphophorus maculatus) have released spontaneously C\u2010type retroviruses associated with transcriptase activity (Frerichs et al., 1991; Petry et al., 1992). The complete nucleotide sequence of the snakehead retrovirus (SnRV), exhibiting persistent infection of the striped snakehead (Ophicephalus striatus) cell line (SSN\u20101), has been analysed (Hart et al., 1996). The proteins (p70, p65 and p28) of the retrovirus from platyfish cell culture react with antiserum directed against the p27 protein of feline leukaemia virus (FeLV), and RT activity is inhibited by antibodies against the RT of FeLV. In addition, hybridization experiments have revealed sequence homology between FeLV and the genome of platyfish (Petry et al., 1992). Retrovirus\u2010like particles with RT activity and a RNA of 7.3 kb have been isolated from coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch), masou salmon (O. masou), rainbow trout (O. mykiss), iwana (Salvelinus pluvius) and ayu (Plecoglossus altivelis) (Oh et al., 1995).",

The cytopathogenic virus replicates in cultivated kidney cells of Boa constrictor and Koch\u2019s postulates could be fulfilled using infectious tissue culture medium (Schumacher et al., 1994b). A highly divergent retroviral sequence was detected in blood samples of tuatara (Spenodon punctatus). Sequence analysis of isolated retroviral fragment demonstrated substantially differences concerning protease and reverse transcriptase genes of retroviruses of mammals and birds (Tristem et al., 1995).

The icosahedral virus measures 38 nm in diameter and has one molecule of ssRNA. The role of the virus in inducing disease in opaleye fish is unknown, but the agent proved to be pathogenic to marine pinniped mammals. Opaleyes are associated with California sea lions and serve as intermediated hosts for the lungworm (Parafilaroides decorus) of the sea lion (Smith et al., 1980). Calicivirus (SMSV\u20105) isolated from these lungworms has proved to be pathogenic to terrestrial mammals, inducing vesicular exanthema of swine (VES) (Fig. 6). VES epizootics were first recorded in 1932 in California, after which the disease spread through the US via swineherds; it is now eradicated. The origin of the pathogen was not known at that time, but it is now obvious that the virus was transmitted from aquatic to terrestrial animals bridging water\u2013land barriers and phylogenetic distances. Marine caliciviruses seem to continue to emerge from reservoirs in the ocean and be introduced to terrestrial populations. As well as crossing the land\u2013sea interface these viruses cross species and class barriers (Smith et al., 1986a, 1998). Two serotypes (SMSV\u20106 and SMSV\u20107) detected in opaleye fish are neutralized by sera of California and Steller sea lions (Barlough et al., 1988). It has been shown that the SMSV\u20105 serotype, which replicates in African green monkey cells (Vero cells), is able to infect fish, seals, mink, pigs and primates (Smith et al., 1980, 1986b). An unrooted distance tree of caliciviruses established on the RNA polymerase (3D region) sequence grouped SMSV in the genus Vesivirus together with calicivirus of dolphin (Tur\u20101), chimpanzee (Pan\u20101) and reptiles (Crotalus calicivirus type 1, Cro\u20101) (Matson et al., 1996; Nick Knowles, personal communication).",

Since that time, similar disease cases (\u2018viral encephalopathy and retinopathy\u2019, VER; \u2018fish encephalitis\u2019, \u2018encephalomyelitis\u2019, \u2018striped jack viral nervous necrosis\u2019) occurring with high mortalities among larvae and juveniles of several species out of 10 families of marine fish have been described in the Indo\u2010Pacific region, the Mediterranean, France and Scandinavia. The causative agents have been previously described as picornavirus\u2010like. Piscine nodaviruses have a tropism for nerve cells and during NNV\u2010infection they are spread from the spinal cord to the brain and retina. There are differences regarding the occurrence (age, species) and severity of the disease (OIE, 2001). A vertical transmission of fish nodaviruses has been shown (Munday and Nakai, 1997). The striped jack nervous necrosis virus (SJNNV) isolated from larvae of striped jack (Pseudocaranx dentex) (Mori et al., 1992) is characterized and classified as type species of the genus Betanodavirus of Nodaviridae (van Regenmortel et al., 2000). The non\u2010enveloped virus particles, measuring 25 nm, contain two molecules of ssRNA with positive\u2010sense orientation. The RNA does not have poly(A) sequences at the 3\u2032 end. Virions consist of a 40\u2010kDa and a 42\u2010kDa protein. The complete RNA2 of SJVNN and that of an isolate from Dicentrarchus labrax with encephalitis have been sequenced (Nishizawa et al., 1995; Delsert et al., 1997). Based on sequence data of the SJNNV\u2010RNA2 a portion of the protein gene could be amplified by PCR (Nishizawa et al., 1994). A RT\u2010PCR has been used to detect the presence of piscine nodavirus in a wide range of fish species (Nishizawa et al., 1997b; Thiery et al., 1997). A sequence part of the RNA2 of Atlantic halibut nodavirus (AH95NorA) shows 80% identity to that of SJNNV and comprises features common to all nodaviruses. The RNA2 of isolates from Europe (European sea bass from the Mediterranean) and Japan (redspotted grouper) shows sequence identity of 99.5% (Sideris, 1997). The T2 region of the RNA2 of AH95NorA shares 98% of the nucleotide sequence of barfin flounder nervous necrosis virus, while the nucleotide sequence identity to SJNNV is 76%. Phylogenetic analysis based on the nucleotide sequences of the variable region (T4) of the viral capsid protein gene region of fish nodaviruses reveals a close relationship (Grotmol et al., 2000). Comparison of T4 of 20 piscine nodaviruses shows four major clades, e.g. the striped jack clade, the redspotted grouper clade, the tiger puffer clade and the barfin flounder clade. Interestingly, AH95NorA is grouped in the barfin flounder clade together with strains isolated from Pacific fish, suggesting a transmission of the viruses from the Pacific to the Atlantic Ocean or vice versa (Nishizawa et al., 1997b; Grotmol et al., 2000). However, piscine nodavirus strains of European sea bass from the Atlantic coast of France could not be assigned to any of the four clades (Thiery et al., 1997). Comparison of features of the RNAs, capsid protein processing and the low similarity (e.g. coat protein, 10% amino acid similarity) suggest that piscine nodaviruses are distinct from insect nodaviruses (Delsert et al., 1997; Munday and Nakai, 1997). At present, hosts recognized are several species out of 10 families of fishes. Piscine nodavirus species of the genus Betanodavirus are the type species striped jack nervous necrosis virus (SJNNV), barfin flounder nervous necrosis virus (BFNNV), Dicentrarchus labrax encephalitis virus (DIEV), Japanese flounder nervous necrosis virus (JFNNV), Lates calcarifer encephalitis virus (LcEV), redspotted grouper nervous necrosis virus (RGNNV), and tiger puffer nervous necrosis virus (TPNNV). Tentative species in the genus are the Atlantic halibut nodavirus (AHNV) and the Malabar grouper nervous necrosis virus (MGNNV) (van Regenmortel et al., 2000). Viral encephalopathy and retinopathy or viral nervous necrosis is an OIE significant disease. Piscine nodaviruses can be propagated efficiently in vitro exclusively in the SSN\u20101 cell line originating from tissue of striped snakehead (Ophicephalus striatus) (Frerichs et al., 1996; Iwamoto et al., 1999). However, the disadvantage of the use of SSN\u20101 cells is that the cell line is persistently infected with the snakehead retrovirus (SnRV) (Frerichs et al., 1991). Optimal growth temperatures differ among the four genotypic variants, e.g. 25\u201330\u00b0C for the RGNNV genotype, 25\u201330\u00b0C for the SJNNV genotype, 20\u00b0C for the TPNNV genotype, and 15\u00b0C for the BFNNV genotype. Diagnostic procedures recommended are at present electron microscopy, immunohistochemistry, fluorescent antibody techniques, ELISA and PCR (OIE, 2001).",

            "text": "The family Reoviridae contains the genera Aquareovirus, Coltivirus, Cypovirus, Fijivirus, Orbivirus, Orthoreovirus, Oryzavirus, Phytoreovirus and Rotavirus. Members of the family are non\u2010enveloped, icosahedral to spherical virions with one to three distinct capsid shells and an overall size of 60\u201380 nm in diameter. The genome consists of 10, 11 or 12 segments of dsRNA. Several polypeptides form one or two outer coats as well as an inner coat. There are at least three internal structural proteins acting as RNA polymerase and an associated enzyme involved in mRNA synthesis. Reoviruses occurring in aquatic animals are grouped in the genus Aquareovirus. Aquareoviruses have a wide host spectrum infecting finfish, shellfish and crustacea. Common features of the aquareoviruses are the double capsid shell, 11 dsRNAs and seven structural proteins (VP1\u2013VP7). Virions, measuring about 80 nm in diameter, have type\u2010 and group\u2010specific antigenic determinants located in the outer capsid protein. Aquareoviruses replicate in fish and mammalian cell lines, inducing syncytia formation at 15\u201325\u00b0C (Winton et al., 1987; Lupiani et al., 1995; van Regenmortel et al., 2000).",

            "text": "The first finfish reovirus (golden shiner virus, GSRV) was isolated from golden shiner (Notemigonus crysoleucas) in the USA (Plumb et al., 1979). Later, several reovirus\u2010like agents were found to be present in a variety of aquatic animals (finfish, shellfish and crustaceans). The aquatic reoviruses did not fit within any of the established genera of Reoviridae. Apart from the 11 segments of dsRNA of which species of the genus Rotavirus are composed, aquatic reoviruses differ from other reoviruses in terms of host range, optimal growth temperature, serology, RNA profiles and polypeptide profile (Winton et al., 1987). Consequently, reoviruses of aquatic animals were grouped in the genus Aquareovirus of Reoviridae (van Regenmortel et al., 2000). Aquareoviruses measure about 80 nm; their viral density in caesium chloride is 1.36 g/cm3. Virions contain seven structural proteins (VP1: 130 kDa; VP2: 127 kDa; VP3: 126 kDa; VP4: 73 kDa; VP5: 71 kDa; VP6: 46 kDa; and VP7: 35 kDa) and five non\u2010structural proteins (NS97: 97 kDa; NS39: 39 kDa; NS29: 29 kDa; NS28: 28 kDa; and NS15: 15 kDa). The inner capsid is encoded by segments 1, 2, 3, 5, 6 and 8, the major outer capsid by segment 10, and the non\u2010structural proteins by segments 4, 7, 9 and 11. Segments 1\u201310 encode one protein, while segment 11 encodes two proteins, the non\u2010structural proteins NS29 and NS15. Comparison of these two non\u2010structural proteins by partial protease digestion indicated that NS15 is a truncated form of NS29, being initiated at a downstream initiation codon (Subramanian et al., 1994). Nucleotide sequence analysis of segment 11 of the genome of striped bass reovirus (SBRV) revealed a 780\u2010nucleotide open reading frame (ORF) coding for 236 amino acids and a 480\u2010nucleotide ORF coding for 145 amino acids. The genome segment 11 contains 24 non\u2010translated nucleotides at the 5\u2032 end and 48 at the 3\u2032 end. The gene codes for NS29 and NS15 showed no sequence relatedness to gene sequences of the other members of Reoviridae (Subramanian and Samal, 1997). On the basis of RNA\u2013RNA hybridization, several genotypes of aquareoviruses among more than 40 strains have been recognized (Rangel et al., 1999). The genus Aquareovirus includes at present 26 reoviruses of fish and two of shellfish. The species in the genus are divided into six genotypes (Aquareovirus A\u2013F) (Table 4). Genogroup A is the most heterogeneous, consisting of members of cold\u2010 and warm\u2010water fishes of several continents. Only group A and B show serologic cross\u2010reactivity. RNA\u2013RNA hybridization between genogroups A and B revealed segment 10 (encoding the major outer capsid protein) to be the most variable gene (Lupiani et al., 1995). The VP7, the glycosylated outer capsid protein, being responsible for virulence, stability and neutralization of the reoviruses is different between the genotypes as determined via Western blots (Lupiani et al., 1997; McPhillips et al., 1998). Three\u2010dimensional cryomicroscopy showed that trypsin treatment removes VP7 completely and induces conformational changes in the VP5 trimer (Nason et al., 2000). The viruses replicate in several fish and mammalian cells at 15\u201325\u00b0C forming syncytia and lysis of infected cells (Winton et al., 1987; Samal et al., 1998). The infectivity of the viruses can be increased by treatment with proteases (McPhillips et al., 1998). Several reoviruses have been isolated during surveillance of cultured and feral fish worldwide. Most of the isolates are non\u2010pathogenic or of low pathogenicity in their host species (Hetrick et al., 1992). However, the grass carp reovirus (GCRV), infecting cyprinids in China seems to be highly pathogenic in grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella) (Chen and Jiang, 1984). A specific selected peptide from a nonapeptides library inhibited grass carp haemorrhage virus (GCHV) by 10 000 times in vitro (Wang et al., 2000). The GCRV segments 1, 2 and 3 have been sequenced recently and revealed conserved terminal sequences comparable with mammalian reoviruses. Segment 1 (3939 bp) has amino acid homology (41% similarity) to orthoreovirus segment 2 and encodes a putative guanylyl/methyl transferase. The segment 2 of GCRV resembles segment 1 of orthoreoviruses (RNA\u2010dependent RNA polymerase) (57% similarity), segment 3 encodes for a dsRNA binding protein (NTPase, helicase) (50% similarity) as orthoreovirus segment 3 (Fang et al., 2000).",

            "text": "Several reovirus\u2010like agents have been detected in reptiles, but they have not been conclusively demonstrated to be responsible for disease in their hosts. Jacobson (1986) reported that an imported Chinese viper (Azemiops feyi) died shortly after acquisition. Viper heart cells (VH2) exhibited giant cell formation after inoculation with suspensions of the liver and spleen of the animal. Electron microscopy of intestinal epithelial cells and infected cell cultures have shown non\u2010enveloped intracytoplasmic viruses of 66 nm in diameter most closely resembling the morphology of reoviruses. In addition, syncytia\u2010forming virus particles have been isolated from internal organs of a moribund royal python (Python regius). Electron microscopy of negatively stained virions has revealed spherical to icosahedral particles of 70\u201375 nm in diameter with a double capsid layer. The viral genome was found to be composed of 10 segments of dsRNA. Migration patterns of the RNA differed from those of the mammalian reovirus 3. Antiserum against mammalian reoviruses types 1, 2 and 3 did not neutralize the python reovirus. The virus was not able to haemagglutinate human type 0 erythrocytes (Ahne et al., 1987b). Reo\u2010like viruses have been isolated from the brain of a moribund rattlesnake (Crotalus viridis) with central nervous system symptoms (loss of coordination, loss of general proprioception). Infected Vero cells formed syncytial giant cells 4 days after infection at 30\u00b0C. Electron microscopy of negatively stained virus preparations from infected cell cultures has revealed icosahedral particles with a double capsid layer measuring 75 nm in diameter. Electrophoretic analysis of the genome separated 10 segments of dsRNA similar to those of the python\u2010reovirus, but different from those of avian and mammalian reoviruses. The rattlesnake reovirus did not haemagglutinate pig erythrocytes and was not neutralized by antisera against the avian reovirus S1133 and the mammalian reovirus type 3 (Vieler et al., 1994). Four reoviruses isolated from emerald tree boa (Corallus caninus), Aesculapian snake (Elaphe longissima) and green iguana (Iguana iguana) replicate in reptilian cells at 28\u00b0C, forming giant syncytia. 5\u2010iododeoxyuridine (IUdR) and chloroform did not inactivate the viral infectivity. Electron microscopy of infected tissue culture fluid revealed reovirus particles that did not haemagglutinate avian or human erythrocytes. In cross\u2010neutralization tests some serotype\u2010like differences between snake reoviruses can be observed, but no serological reaction with the mammalian reovirus type 3 occurred. However, one\u2010way reaction between antisera against the reptilian and avian reoviruses has been observed. Electrophoretic analysis showed minor differences between the migration patterns of the 10 dsRNAs of the reptilian reoviruses, but they resembled the pattern of chicken reovirus (Blahak et al., 1995). Elaphe reovirus isolated from juvenile Moellendorff\u2019s ratsnakes (Elaphe moellendorffi) and beauty snakes (Elaphe taenuris) produced large syncytia formation in VH2 cells at 30\u00b0C. The viruses (70\u201385 nm) exhibiting a double capsid layer did not haemagglutinate guinea pig and chicken erythrocytes. The genome composed of 10 segments of dsRNA showed different migration patterns to those of mammalian and avian reoviruses. Experimental infection of black ratsnake (Elaphe obsoleta obsoleta) with the Elaphe reovirus has induced diffuse subacute interstitial pneumonia with respiratory epithelial cell hyperplasia and syncytia (Lamirande et al., 1999). Recently, reoviral infection of iguanas on Honduran islands has been reported; 47% of 49 sera from wild healthy spiny\u2010tailed iguanas tested positive for reptilian reoviruses in neutralization tests (Gravendyck et al., 1998).",

            "text": "The first fish pathogenic birnavirus was isolated from brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) at the National Fish Hatchery, Leetown, West Virginia, USA (Wolf et al., 1959). The agent was obtained during an epizootic of rainbow trout fingerlings suffering from infectious pancreatic necrosis (IPN). This infectious pancreatis necrosis virus (IPNV) was deposited in the ATCC as ATCC VR299. IPNV had been detected for years in several places in North America associated with high mortality rates of trout fry at water temperatures of 8\u201312\u00b0C. In the following years, IPNV strains were recognized in many countries around the world among individuals of more than 20 families of teleost fish. The agent is probably present in all major trout\u2010farming countries. Recently, an IPNV closely related to IPNV fr21 and N1 was first detected in Australia (Crane et al., 2000). IPNV is transmitted by faeces, urine and sexual products of infected fish and it is easily spread by shipment of contaminated fish eggs from one country to another. Studies on factors affecting the transmission and outbreaks of IPN indicated that iodophores used as a disinfectant during the artificial egg\u2010fertilization process did not completely eradicate IPN infectivity (Ahne et al., 1989). Survivors of an IPNV outbreak become IPNV carriers and can shed the virus for the whole lifetime (Hill, 1982; Wolf, 1988). IPNV can be transmitted by faeces of piscivorous birds, e.g. heron, crow, grackle, kingfisher, sparrows, mallards, egrets and ospreys (McAllister and Owens, 1992). The majority of aquatic birnaviruses are antigenically related, representing one large serogroup (A) with 10 serotypes. Only a few antigenically unrelated aquatic birnaviruses form a second, minor serogroup (B) (Table 5). Most IPNV isolates from USA belong to the A1 (West Buxton) serotype, the Canadian isolates (C1, C2, C3, Jasper) to serotypes A6\u2013A9, and the European isolates (Sp, Ab, He, Te) to the A2\u2013A5 and A10 serotypes. The IPNV serotypes A1, A2, and A3 have been detected in Asia (Hill and Way, 1995).",

            "text": "The aquatic birnaviruses share similarities in morphology and biochemical/biophysical properties. The non\u2010enveloped, single\u2010shelled IPNV virions have an icosahedral morphology and measure 60 nm in diameter. They possess a bisegmented dsRNA genome. The larger genome segment A (3 kb) contains an ORF encoding a 100\u2010kDa protein that is subsequently cleaved to pVP2 (63 kDa), NS (29 kDa) and VP3 (29\u201331 kDa) proteins by the protease activity associated with the VP4 (NS) protein. The VP4 protease is a unusual type of serine protease sharing properties with prokaryotic leader peptidases and other bacterial proteases, and cannot cleave heterologous substrates (e.g. infectious bursal disease virus, IBDV, proteins) or vice versa (Lejal et al., 2000; Petit et al., 2000). The A segment contains a small ORF partly overlapping the 5\u2032 end of the ORF encoding VP5 (17 kDa) (Heppell et al., 1995a). The smaller genome segment B encodes the transcriptase (VP1, 90\u2013110 kDa), with 41% homology to the IBDV VP1. It is present as free and genome\u2010linked (5\u2032 terminus) protein VP1 in the virion. The virion VP1 primes viral RNA synthesis in vitro, a VP1\u2013pN structure acts as a primer for viral RNA synthesis (Magyar et al., 1998). The pVP2 protein is processed to the major capsid protein VP2 (50\u201355 kDa) (Duncan and Dobos, 1986; Harvarstein et al., 1990; Manning and Leong, 1990). Investigation of the subcellular localization of IPNV structural proteins suggests that VP2 is glycosylated freely in the cytoplasm of infected cells (Espinoza et al., 2000). The central variable domain and 20 adjacent amino acids of the conserved C\u2010terminal part of the major immunogenic polypeptide VP2 induce the animal\u2019s protective immunogenic response (Heppell et al., 1995b). A reverse genetic system for IPNV was established by Yao and Vakharia (1998) using plus\u2010stranded RNA transcripts derived from cloned cDNA. Quasispecies heterogeneity and rapid mutation characteristics of IPNV have been studied with RNA fingerprinting. It has been found that three clusters exist and that the IPNV Sp represents a different evolutionary route from those of the IPNV Ab and the VR299 clusters. Molecular relationship could be correlated with biological characteristics (e.g. cell line, adaptive replication at high temperature) (Hsu et al., 1995). Phylogenetic comparison of the deduced amino acid sequences of the VP2 coding region of 28 aquatic birnaviruses, including the type strains of the serogroup A, reveals six genogroups with several genotypes. The most divergent viruses exhibit a similarity of 81.2%. The genogroups based on the entire VP2\u2013ORF generally correlate with geographical origin and serological classification (B. L. Nicholson, personal communication). Investigations of the VP2 gene by PCR and RFLP cluster analysis grouped 17 Asian isolates (all serotype A3) in four major genogroups. The groups based on the variation of the VP2 gene correlated with the serological classification based on VP2\u2010specific monoclonal antibody reaction pattern (Lee et al., 1996). However, characterization of the small ORF on the genome segment A of 20 IPNV strains reveals three major genotypes. According to correlation between serological and genomic classification, some of the 10 serotypes of serogroup A seem in fact to be subtypes. Serotype A4 (IPNV isolated from pike (Hecht) in Germany) (Ahne, 1978b) appears different from all serotypes of Serogroup A (Heppell et al., 1995b). IPNV induces apoptosis preceding necrosis in fish cell lines by down\u2010regulating the survival factor Mcl\u20101, a Bcl\u20102 homologue (Hong et al., 1998, 1999a). A variant of the green fluorescent protein gene (EGFP) expressed in a fish cell line showed dynamic non\u2010typical apoptotic cell morphological changes during IPNV infection (Hong et al., 1999b). Induction of the antiviral Mx protein by IFN protects against IPNV in CHSE cells (Nygaard et al., 2000). Different IPNV vaccines have been established: an inactivated vaccine used in Norway, an attenuated vaccine, and a recombinant vaccine available in Norway based on the VP2 protein of strain N1 (Frost and Ness, 1997; Pettersen, 1997; Frost et al., 1998). IPN is an OIE significant disease. Recommended screening procedures for IPNV are direct methods such as isolation, neutralization and immune fluorescence assay test (OIE, 2001).",

The genera Lymphocystivirus and Ranavirus comprise iridoviruses of poikilothermic vertebrates. Common features are icosahedral virions of 120\u2013350 nm in diameter. Most of the iridoviruses have an envelope derived from the host\u2010cell membrane released by a budding process. The viral genome consists of one molecule of linear dsDNA; virions contain up to 36 polypeptides (van Regenmortel et al., 2000). The main structural component of the iridoviruses is the major capsid protein (MCP), which seems to be highly conserved among members of the families Iridoviridae, Phycodnaviridae and Asfarviridae (Tidona et al., 1998).",

Iridoviruses of the genus Ranavirus infect amphibians, but related agents have been recognized as cause of serious systemic diseases among feral, cultured and ornamental fish, leading to severe necrosis of the renal and spleenic haematopoietic tissue (derivation of name: epizootic haematopoietic necrosis, EHN) (Langdon and Humphrey, 1987; Ahne et al., 1997). It has been shown that the amino acid sequence of the MCP contains highly conserved domains within many of the newly described iridoviruses of lower vertebrates. About 30 iridovirus\u2010like isolates from different species of lower vertebrates exhibiting systemic EHN disease syndromes have been placed in the genus Ranavirus. MCP sequences and comparison of nucleic acid profiles (restriction profile length patterns, RFLP) revealed six groups of viruses according to geographical origin and hosts: group 1: isolates from Australian fish; group 2: isolates from Australian frogs; group 3: isolates from South East Asian fish; group 4: isolates from European fish; group 5: isolates from South American frogs; and group 6: isolates from European and North American frogs (Hyatt et al., 2000). The seventh report of the ICTV lists the frog virus 3 as type species (with four strains) and five tentative species (with several strains) of the genus Ranavirus. The genus Lymphocystivirus comprises the type species lymphocystis disease virus 1 (with two strains), and lymphocystis disease virus 2 (with one strain) as tentative species and the goldfish virus 1 as unassigned species in the family Iridoviridae (van Regenmortel et al., 2000) (Table 6, p. 434).",

            "text": "Frog virus 3 (FV\u20103, ATCC VR\u2010567), the type species of the genus Ranavirus, isolated in 1965 from a leopard frog (Rana pipiens) with renal adenocarcinoma, has been studied extensively (Granoff, 1989). FV\u20103 is pathogenic for tailbuds, hatching stage embryos and tadpoles of frogs and Fowler\u2019s toads (Bufo woodhousei fowleri). The virus causes severe oedema, dermal haemorrhages and high mortalities. FV\u20103 replicates in mammalian, reptilian and fish cell lines, and in primary chicken embryo cells (Essani and Granoff, 1989) between 12 and 30\u00b0C. Virions measure 130\u2013160 nm in diameter, and contain 29 structural and 61 non\u2010structural proteins (Elliott and Kelly, 1980). The core consists of 10\u201315 phosphoproteins (M\nr 10\u2013114 \u00d7 103). The dsDNA genome is highly methylated at CpG sequences by a virus\u2010encoded methyl\u2010transferase. It is circularly permuted and terminally redundant (Goorha and Murti, 1982; Essani and Granoff, 1989). The methylation of DNA takes place in the cytoplasm and is required for the production of genomic\u2010size DNA during FV\u20103 replication. The FV\u20103 DNA methyl\u2010transferase has been identified and analysed (Kaur et al., 1995). The viral life cycle is characterized by two\u2010stage DNA synthesis cycles (Fig. 10, p. 435). In the first stage, less than the full genome of viral DNA is synthesized in the nucleus. In the second stage, the DNA is replicated in the cytoplasm as concatemers, in a similar way to bacteriophage genomes. Finally, the concatemers are cleaved to produce mature viral DNA (Goorha, 1982; Granoff, 1989). The virions assemble in the cytoplasm and are released by budding (Goorha, 1995). An ATPase is associated with viral particles and possibly integrated in virions (Aubertin et al., 1971). Virion proteins contain a peptide rapidly inhibiting cellular macromolecular synthesis (Willis and Granoff, 1976). Cellular RNA and DNA synthesis are shut down upon infection. Three temporal classes of mRNAs without poly\u2010A tails have been identified as undergoing no post\u2010transcriptional cleavage. RNA synthesis is a sequentially controlled process starting in the nucleus of the infected cells requiring modified cellular RNA polymerase II (Goorha, 1981). Protein translation is determined by the availability of transcripts. Virus proteins are regulated at the transcriptional and post\u2010transcriptional level (Willis et al., 1985). FV\u20103 seems to have evolved unique signals for the inhibition and termination of transcription as it has no regulatory sequences resembling those of other eukaryotic genes. Highly methylated promoters that are normally refractory to transcription are used from the host polymerase. A few ORFs of FV\u20103 have been sequenced and their regulating regions studied (Thompson et al., 1986; Munnes et al., 1995). FV\u20103 induces changes in the cellular cytoskeleton. Microtubules are reduced and intermediate filaments are reorganized around virus assembly sites and anchor the virus particles beneath the nucleus. Late in infection many \u2018microvillus\u2010like\u2019 projections containing microfilaments and virus particles appear on the cell surface, suggesting a role for these cytoskeleton elements in virus release. FV\u20103 inhibits selectively tubulin synthesis, phosphorylates vimentin and modifies actin. The changes are relevant to FV\u20103 replication as heat\u2010inactivated or mutants of FV\u20103 do not induce these alterations (Murti and Goorha, 1990). Parenteral inoculation of mice or rats with FV\u20103, inactivated FV\u20103 or its solubilized proteins induces an acute degenerative hepatitis leading to death in less than 24 h. The pathogenic mechanism seems to be a toxic one because FV\u20103 does not multiply at temperatures above 30\u00b0C (Kirn et al., 1989). Frog virus 1 (FV\u20101), frog virus 2 (FV\u20102), and Luck\u00e9 tumour\u2010associated viruses (LT, T) are antigenically related and probably represent various strains of FV\u20103. All of these viruses induce oedema and mortalities in tadpoles of toads and frogs. The tadpole oedema virus (TEV; ATCC VR\u2010678) causes oedema and death in adult anurans such as bullfrogs and toads (Scaphiosus hammondii americanus, Bufo americanus, B. woodhousii fowleri) (Granoff, 1989). Analysis of the MCP and RFLP of TEV revealed high homology to FV\u20103 (Hyatt et al., 2000).",

BIV (120\u2013136 nm) shares characteristics of the piscine EHN iridoviruses, e.g. morphogenesis, ultrastructure, serology, susceptibility to cell lines, pathogenicity and genomic features.

The causative agent was believed to be a protozoan parasite, named \u2018Toddia\u2019 or \u2018Pirhemocyton\u2019. However, electron microscopy studies have shown that the inclusion bodies consist of arrays of iridovirus\u2010like particles of different sizes (up to 450 nm) depending on the hosts. Viral features such as size, formation of crystalline arrays of particles and membrane arrangement in mature erythrocytes differ within the diverse anuran host species (Alves de Matos and Paperna, 1993a, b; Alves de Matos et al., 1995). Erythrocytic necrosis virus (ENV) appears to acquire its envelope from lamellar membranes which surround the particles.

The causative agent has been identified as an iridovirus termed lymphocystis disease virus (LCDV). Strains of LCDV appear to be heterologous in size, measuring 198\u2013227 nm and sometimes up to 380 nm. LCDV has been detected in more than 140 species of freshwater, eustarine and marine fishes (Wolf, 1988). LCDV\u20101 affects flounder (Platichthys flesus) and plaice (Pleuronectes platessa). LCDV\u20102 is found in dab (Limanda limanda) (Anders, 1989a). The viruses cannot be sufficiently cultivated in cell cultures. The icosahedral virions are covered by two protein layers and have filaments on the surface. LDCV DNA exhibits low homology with DNA of FV\u20103 (Darai et al., 1983, 1985). The LCDV\u20101 genome contains 195 potential ORFs of 102.7 kbp (GenBank L63545) (Tidona and Darai, 1997). By sequence analysis, e.g. a DNA\u2010dependent RNA polymerase II subunit, zinc\u2010finger proteins, a helicase and a guanosine triphosphate (GTP) phosphohydrolase have been detected in LCDV\u20101 (van Regenmortel et al., 2000). The LCDV\u20102 genome consists of 98 kbp, as shown by restriction endonuclease analysis (van Regenmortel et al., 2000). About 33 LCDV polypeptides (M\nr 14\u2013220 \u00d7 103) can be separated by SDS\u2010PAGE. A thymidine kinase, an ATPase, a DNase and an RNase have been demonstrated in purified LCDV particles (Fl\u00fcgel et al., 1982). ORF 167L of LCDV encodes a protein with homology to the TNFR superfamily. The ORF is conserved in the genome of LCDV affecting flounder, plaice and dab. A monoclonal antibody (mAb) has been produced against the 29\u2010kDa protein of plaice LCDV expressed in E. coli. The mAb binds specifically to LCDV proteins present in the cytoplasm of infected cells around the lymphocystis nodules of dab and plaice (S. Essbauer, unpublished data). Infection with LCDV leads to transformation and enlargement of cells of the skin and in the connective tissue of internal organs. Infected cells undergo massive hypertrophy and encapsidation by an extracellular hyaline matrix. LCD is characterized as a chronic benign disease with rare mortality. Infection rates are increased by stress factors (Wolf, 1988). LCDV infections are diagnosed by electron microscopy, by PCR specific for the MCP of LCDV (Tidona et al., 1998), or by serology (ELISA, Lorenzen and Dixon, 1991).",

The viruses inducing high mortality in affected fish share features with FV\u20103 and are considered as tentative members (EHNV group) of the genus Ranavirus of Iridoviridae (Ahne et al., 1997, 1998b). EHNV has been isolated from redfin perch (Perca fluviatilis) (redfin perch virus, RFPV) and from rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) (rainbow trout virus, RTV) in Australia (Langdon et al., 1986; Langdon and Humphrey, 1987; Whittington and Reddacliff, 1995; van Regenmortel et al., 2000). The virus was experimentally transmitted to fry and young fish of Percichthyidae, Teraponidae, Salmonidae and Galaxiidae, inducing high mortalities within few days (Whittington and Reddacliff, 1995). ESV has been isolated from an epizootic in sheatfish (Silurus glanis) in Germany (Ahne et al., 1997). ECV was isolated from disease outbreaks in catfish (Ictalurus melas) in France and in Italy (Pozet et al., 1992; Bovo et al., 1993). The highly pathogenic viruses EHNV, ESV and ECV cause systemic infections leading to severe haematopoietic necrosis (EHN) in fish. Viruses of the EHN group replicate in several fish cell lines at 15\u201328\u00b0C, inducing cytoplasmic inclusion bodies and lysis of infected cells. The viruses are released from infected cells by budding. EHN is notifiable to the OIE. The EHN viruses can be identified by IFAT, ELISA, immunoelectron microscopy and PCR, but not by neutralization tests, as the agents do not induce neutralizing antibodies (Hedrick et al., 1992a; Ahne et al., 1997; OIE, 2001). EHNV, ESV, ECV have been compared with iridovirus isolates from amphibians, e.g. REIR and FV\u20103. The viruses share similarities in morphology and size (160 \u00b1 10 nm in diameter), they cross\u2010react in IFAT, but the viruses can be distinguished by SDS\u2010PAGE, Western blotting and RE fragment patterns. More than 20 polypeptides can be recognized by SDS\u2010PAGE. The MCP of EHNV is slightly larger (51 kDa) compared with that of ESV and ECV (49 kDa). The polypeptides of 120, 55, 40 and 21 kDa of the piscine and amphibian iridoviruses associated with systemic diseases cross\u2010react to a high degree with homologous and heterologous antisera in Western blot. Electrophoresis patterns of the restriction enzyme fragments are similar in the case of the European piscine iridoviruses (ESV, ECV), but they are different from EHNV (Ahne et al., 1998b). According to sequence analysis of two cosmids from an EHNV library, the virus encodes a DNA polymerase, a helicase and an eIF\u20102\u03b1\u2010like protein (Yu et al., 1999). In order to investigate the function of eIF\u20102\u03b1 proteins of different iridoviruses (EHNV, ESV, ECV, FV\u20103 and REIR), the ORF of eIF\u20102\u03b1 has been expressed in prokaryotic and eukaryotic systems. This viral protein acts as a translation initiation factor homologue during the infection of cells with the iridoviruses. The protein has been found to be of 29 kDa, its sequence is highly conserved in EHNV, ECV, ESV and in the frog viruses FV\u20103 and REIR (Fig. 12) (S. Essbauer, unpublished data). Analysis of proteins by SDS\u2010PAGE and Western blots with different antisera and MCP sequencing of a pike\u2010perch (Stizostedion lucioperca), a cod (Gadus morhua) and a turbot (Scopthalmus maximus) iridovirus revealed a close relationship between the investigated viruses and the EHNV group (Ariel et al., 2000; Tapiovaara et al., 2000).",

LMBV (174 nm), which causes mortality in wild largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides), has been isolated from the swimbladder and liver of infected fish (Piaskoski et al., 1999). Juvenile largemouth bass and striped bass (Morone saxatilis) are susceptible to LMBV.

Investigations on what triggers its deadly effect on largemouth bass, or whether it might have any impact on other species are under progress (http://www.promedmail.org; release from the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department). Horizontal transmission of LMBV has been shown; vertical transmission is suspected as high concentrations of virus are maintained in gonad tissue (Plumb et al., 1996). Sequence analysis of the MCP and the methyl\u2010transferase genes reveals high identity of LMBV with iridoviruses isolated from doctor fish (Labroides dimidatus, DFV\u201016) and guppy (Poecilia reticulata, GV\u20106) (Mao et al., 1997; Plumb et al., 1999). The MCPs of DFV\u201016 and GV\u20106, which are obtained from fish imported from South East Asia, have proved to be identical (Hedrick and McDowell, 1995; Mao et al., 1997). Both viruses possess low pathogenicity to rainbow trout and chinook salmon (Hedrick and McDowell, 1995). Polypeptide pattern comparison and RFLP analysis of the SCRV\u2010like viruses reveal a few differences (Mao et al., 1997). All three isolates cross\u2010react with the EHN viruses and FV\u20103 (Hedrick and McDowell, 1995; Mao et al., 1997; Plumb et al., 1999), but the MCP of LMBV has only 80% amino acid identity with FV\u20103. DFV and GV\u20106 DNA do not hybridize with FV\u20103 DNA. These results confirm that FV\u20103 and SCRV are distinct Ranavirus species (Mao et al., 1997; Plumb et al., 1999; Hyatt et al., 2000).",

The internal nucleid surrounds a circular to bar\u2010shaped electron\u2010dense core and has a diameter of 208 nm (Hedrick et al., 1990a; Adkison et al., 1998). The virus is potentially enzootic in wild white sturgeon populations throughout the Pacific Northwest of North America. The disease caused by WSIV is most severe in juvenile sturgeon younger than one year old (LaPatra et al., 1996). WSIV is an epitheliotropic virus infecting the skin, gills and the upper alimentary tract, inducing mortality (Hedrick et al., 1990a). Parts of the integument and skin are hypertrophied, with enlarged Malpighian cells, usually full of virus particles. The WSIV has been isolated in sturgeon cell lines. In contrast to other fish iridoviruses, WSIV is suspected to be horizontally and vertically transmitted from broodstock. Antigenic relationship of WSIV to the EHN\u2010like virus group or RSIV is low. WSIV is epitheliotropic, morphologically different from other iridoviruses, and it can also be distinguished by host\u2010cell susceptibility, type of CPE, and the location of the target host cells. An iridovirus similar to WSIV has been identified in Russian sturgeon (Acipenser guldenstadi) in Northern Europe, where it may be enzootic among cultured populations of several species of sturgeon. Losses of Russian sturgeon due to the viral infection reach 50%. Siberian sturgeon (A. beari) are also susceptible to the virus (Adkison et al., 1998). Lake sturgeon (A. fulvescens) can be infected by WSIV but do not suffer mortality (Hedrick et al., 1992b). The WSIV disease is a significant disease according to the OIE (OIE, 2001). WSIV is diagnosed by immunohistochemistry, IFAT, or neutralization tests.",

Twenty\u2010five fish species of the orders Perciformes, Pleuronectiformes and Tetradontiformes have been reported to be susceptible to RSIV. Infected fish exhibit severe anaemia, petechia of the gills and enlargement of the spleen (Jung et al., 1997). An iridovirus serologically and genetically related to RSIV has been isolated from brown\u2010spotted grouper (Epinephelus tauvina) in Thailand. The isolate does not induce disease in experimentally infected red sea bream (Miyata et al., 1997). RSIV\u2010like viruses can be distinguished by genetic variability (Matsuoka et al., 1996). Polyclonal rabbit antiserum, but not monoclonal antibodies against RSIV, cross\u2010react weakly in IFAT with ranaviruses of the EHNV group, FV\u20103, and an iridovirus isolated from Japanese eel (Anguilla japonica) (Nakajima et al., 1998b). RSIV itself induces minor levels of neutralizing antibodies in immunized rabbits or infected fish. A partial genomic library of RSIV has been constructed and sequenced. ORFs coding for FV\u20103\u2010homologous ATPase, LCDV\u2010homologous DNA\u2010dependent RNA polymerase, and DNA polymerase have been analysed and the small subunit of the ribonucleotide reductase (RNRS) has been identified (Oshima et al., 1998). The RSIV can be isolated from the kidney and spleen of infected fish using fish cell cultures at 20\u201325\u00b0C (Nakajima and Sorimachi, 1994). The agent is identified by IFAT or PCR amplification (specific for RNRS fragment of RSIV) and sequencing (Nakajima et al., 1995; Kurita et al., 1998; Oshima et al., 1998; OIE, 2001). A formalin\u2010killed RSIV vaccine has proved to be effective in a field trial with red sea bream (Nakajima et al., 1999).",

M\u00fcller et al. (1988) report iridoviruses associated with an spontaneous nasopharyngeal and pneumonal epidemic disease in Mediterranean land tortoises (T. hermanni hermanni). Iridoviruses of 150\u2013220 nm in diameter have been detected by electron microscopy in the tracheal lumen and epithelial lung cells of a free\u2010living gopher tortoise (Gopherus polyphemus) suffering from respiratory and pharyngo\u2010oesophageal disease (Daszak et al., 1999).

The iridovirus occurring in T. hermanni with hyperaemic mucosas and liver necrosis could be isolated. It replicates in different reptilian cell lines with an optimum at 28\u00b0C (Marschang et al., 1999). The MCP of the turtle iridoviruses reveals high homology to that of FV\u20103.

The virus has been cultivated in different fish cell lines at 25\u00b0C, reaching titres of 107,5 PFU/ml. Virions, measuring 175\u2013200 nm in diameter, are sensitive to lipid solvents and heat treatment (1 h, 60\u00b0C) and UV (20\u201340 min). The viral replication is inhibited by acyclovir and IUdR (Plumb, 1989). The virus has a buoyant density of 1.29 g/cm3 caesium chloride. Thirty\u2010two polypeptides are encoded in the virus genome, of which are 18 structural proteins. The IcHV\u20101 genome is 134.2 kbp long and has 77 ORFs; 14 of these are in direct repeated regions (DR, each 18.5 kbp) flanking a 97.1 kbp unique long (UL) region. The IcHV\u20101 seems to be unrelated to mammalian herpesviruses (Davison, 1992; Kucuktas and Brady, 1999; Pringle, 1999). According to genetic comparisons and the low similarity to other herpesviruses a separate evolutionary origin for IcHV\u20101 must be considered (Davison, 1992; Davison and Davison, 1995). IcHV\u20101 gene expression in the direct repeat region is temporally regulated: immediate\u2010early transcripts encoding viral transactivators are of ORFs 1 and 3, early RNAs are encoded by ORFs 2\u20139 and 11\u201314, immediate to late RNAs by ORFs 4, 7 and 10\u201313. For several transcripts (e.g. of ORFs 5 and 6) bicistronic transcripts are reported (Stingley and Gray, 2000). ORF 59 of IcHV\u20101 encodes an abundant hydrophobic membrane glycoprotein, the major envelope glycoprotein of the virus (Kucuktas et al., 1998). ORF 50 encodes a secreted, mucin\u2010like glycoprotein (gp250) revealing different size in several isolates of IcHV\u20101. This is a characteristic of mucin genes caused by crossing\u2010over events between the internal repeat sequences (Vanderheijden et al., 1999). IcHV\u20101 thymidine kinase (TK, encoded by ORF 5 in DR) is highly divergent and biochemically distinguishable from TKs of host cells or other herpesviruses, as it is inhibited by deoxypurines and shows less dTTP\u2010mediated feedback inhibition. The thymidine kinase of IcHV\u20101 has the unique property to use CTP as a donor of phosphate and is related to human deoxycytidine kinase (dCK) (Harrison et al., 1991; Hanson and Thune, 1993). Experimental infection of channel catfish fingerlings with IcHV\u20101 leads to a haemorrhagic, oedematous and anaemic disease and mortality (Plumb, 1989). Fish produce neutralizing antibodies against IcHV\u20101 maintaining for 2 years (Hedrick et al., 1987). Different genetic strains of channel catfish vary in susceptibility to IcHV\u20101, and hybrids especially have proved to be less susceptible (Plumb, 1989). IcHV\u20101 virulence is reduced at temperatures below 20\u00b0C (Wolf, 1988). Blue catfish (Ictalurus furcatus) and white catfish (I. catus) are susceptible to IcHV\u20101 (Wolf and Darlington, 1971; Plumb, 1989). Horizontal transmission has been shown for IcHV\u20101. Nucleic acid\u2010probing techniques give evidence for vertical transmission of IcHV\u20101 (Wise et al., 1988). Diagnosis of IcHV\u20101 infection that according to the OIE induces a significant disease is carried out by IFAT, neutralization tests (Wolf, 1988), ELISA (Crawford et al., 1999), or PCR (Gray et al., 1999a). Less than 0.1 pg of IcHV\u20101 viral DNA can be specifically detected by PCR or nucleic acid\u2010probing technique in acutely or latently infected catfish (Plumb, 1989; Tham and Moon, 1996; Gray et al., 1999a, b). During latency the IcHV\u20101 genome may exist as circular or concatemeric DNA in several tissues in the leucocytes (Gray et al., 1999b). Identification of carrier fish can also be carried out by screening for neutralizing antibodies that vary seasonally (OIE, 2001). A recombinant TK gene deletion mutant of IcHV\u20101 has been constructed. Exposure of fish to the IcHV\u20101 TK\u2212 mutant induces protective immunity against challenge with a lethal dose of wild\u2010type IcHV\u20101 (Zhang and Hanson, 1995). IcHV\u20101 TK\u2212 infections do not persist as long as IcHV\u20101 infection and have reduced shedding ability (Kancharla and Hanson, 1996). An E. coli lacZ gene inserted into the IcHV\u20101 genome is expressed by IcHV\u20101 (Zhang and Hanson, 1996). The potential use of IcHV\u20101 as a vaccine vector for the channel catfish industry is in discussion. An epizootic associated with herpesvirus infection has been recognized in pilchards (Sardinops sagax neopilchardus) off the Australian and New Zealand coastline (Hyatt et al., 1997). The herpesvirus\u2010specific TK has been detected in infected fish by using a PCR technique developed for the IcHV\u20101 TK (Tham and Moon, 1996). The IcHV\u20101 is listed as species in the unassigned genus \u2018Ictalurid herpes\u2010like viruses\u2019 in the seventh report of the ICTV (van Regenmortel et al., 2000).",

A herpesvirus isolated from eels without showing any signs of a disease has induced syncytia in rainbow trout gonad (RTG\u20102) and epithelioma carp (EPC) cell lines (Jorgensen et al., 1994). Anguilla herpesvirus 1 (AngHV\u20101) has been isolated in EK\u20101 (eel kidney) cells from Japanese eel (Anguilla japonica) showing skin lesions. Electron microscopy has revealed virions of 200 nm with nucleocapsids measuring about 115 nm. In experimental infections of Japanese eel cutaneous lesions have been induced (Kobayashi and Miyazaki, 1997). Later, an infectious gill disease among Japanese eel associated with mass mortalities was found to be of herpesvirus origin. The isolated virus is neutralized by AngHV\u20101 antiserum, is pathogenic to eels, and induces dermal lesions such as those reported for AngHV\u20101 (Lee et al., 1999). European eel (Anguilla anguilla) that exhibited haemorrhagic septicaemia and skin lesions have carried herpesvirus\u2010like particles. The isolated viruses have nucleocapsids of 110 nm surrounded by an envelope with spikes. The isolates are serologically related to AngHV\u20101 and \u2018eel herpesvirus Formosa\u2019 (EHVF) (Davidse et al., 1999), a herpesvirus\u2010like agent isolated from Japanese eel with varicella on the surface of the skin (Ueno et al., 1992). In a caesium chloride gradient two virus bands (1.25\u20131.28 and 1.30\u20131.33 g/ml) are obtained. The guanine\u2013cytosine (GC) content of the viral DNA is 32.2% (Shih et al., 1993). EHFV and AngHV\u20101 are tightly clustered, as shown by comparison studies. Both viruses develop syncytia, have the same size and show similar polypeptide patterns to the major polypeptides in SDS\u2010PAGE. Cross\u2010reactivity has been shown by neutralization and Western blot. However, the viruses do obviously not have the same host range (Ueno et al., 1996). European eel infected with EHVF have exhibited severe necrotic hepatitis, haemorrhage and tubular nephritis (Shih, 1997).",

Herpesvirus salmonis\u20101; ATCC VR\u2010868) has been isolated from the ovarian fluid of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) showing high post\u2010spawning mortality. Infected rainbow trout cell lines exhibit pycnosis, syncytia and Cowdry type A intranuclear inclusions carrying hexagonal nucleocapsids of 90\u201395 nm. The enveloped virus (150 nm) is labile to treatment with acid, heat, ether and chloroform; acyclovir inhibits the replication of SalHV\u20101 (Hedrick and Sano, 1989). The viral DNA (GC content of 50%) has a buoyant density of 1.709 g/cm3 (Wolf, 1988). The viral genome (174.4 kbp) consists of a long unique region (133.4 kbp) linked to a short one (25.6 kbp) flanked by an inverted repeat (7.7 kbp). This genomic organization resembles that of members of the genus Varicellovirus, subfamily Alphaherpesvirinae, of Herpesviridae. The SaHV\u20101 shares at least 18 genes with IcHV\u20101. The nucleic acid probe technique has shown that conserved SalHV\u20101 genes are located in the long unique region in at least five rearranged blocks. The junction between two gene blocks contains a dUTPase gene and a part of a putative spliced DNA polymerase gene (Davison, 1998). The SalHV\u20101 has proved to be lethal to fry and fingerlings of rainbow trout. Affected fish exhibit exophthalmia, oedema and necrosis in gill, heart and haematopoietic tissues (Wolf, 1988). Horizontal infection occurs in rainbow trout, brown trout and brook trout (Hedrick and Sano, 1989). Kokanee salmon (O. nerka) seems to be resistant to SalHV\u20101 (Wolf and Smith, 1981). The SalHV\u20101 proved to be not oncogenic (Hedrick et al., 1986).",

Oncorhynchus masou virus) was isolated in Japan from ovarian fluid of masou salmon, Oncorhynchus masou, inducing syncytia formation and lysis of infected cells. Electron microscopy revealed virions of 200\u2013220 nm with a nucleocapsid of 115 nm in diameter. The SalHV\u20102 is labile to ether, heat, acid, and UV treatment. Replication of SalHV\u20102 is inhibited by acyclovir and IUdR. In virus\u2010infected cells 34 polypeptides appear, but the polypeptide pattern is distinct from that of IcHV\u20101 (Kimura and Yoshimizu, 1989). The DNA of SalHV\u20102 has a molecular weight of about 100 \u00d7 106 Da without terminal repeats (Guo et al., 1991a). The SaHV\u20102 genome shows a relationship to the IcHV\u20101 genome (Bernard and Mercier, 1993). The temperature optimum of the viral DNA polymerase is 25\u00b0C (Suzuki et al., 1986). Experimentally infected salmon fry exhibit necrosis and hyperplasia of haematopoietic tissues (Kimura and Yoshimizu, 1989). Horizontal and vertical transmission of SalHV\u20102 have been shown (Wolf, 1988; Kumagai et al., 1997). Survivors of the acute infection developed epidermal papillomas (Kimura and Yoshimizu, 1989). Viral DNA polymerase activity is found in tumours of masou salmon, indicating replication of SalHV\u20102 DNA in the transformed cells (Suzuki et al., 1992). Jodophore treatment of the eggs of masou salmon reduces the transmission of SalHV\u20102 (Yoshimizu et al., 1988). Viral DNA (10 copies/cell) has been detected by DNA hybridization two weeks earlier compared with isolation of virus (Guo et al., 1991b). The SalHV\u20102 related herpesviruses \u2013 the Yamame tumour virus (YTV) isolated from a mandibular tumour of masou salmon (O. masou) and the Nerka tumour virus (NeVTA) obtained from kokanee salmon (O. kisutch) \u2013 are two herpesviruses of salmonid fishes in Japan that have been described in detail (Kimura and Yoshimizu, 1989). NeVTA, SalHV\u20102 and YTV are of high virulence to masou salmon but of lower virulence to coho salmon and rainbow trout (Kumagai et al., 1995). The viruses exhibit close serological and genetic relationships with SalHV\u20102. Differences in migration, of two polypeptides in particular, led to the classification of 12 SalHV\u20102 strains in six groups (Kimura et al., 1984). All Japanese salmonid herpesviruses can be clearly distinguished from the North American herpesvirus strains (Hedrick and Sano, 1989; Kimura and Yoshimizu, 1989; Guo et al., 1991c; Yoshimizu et al., 1995). The SalHV\u20102 strains induce diseases notifiable to the OIE. Viruses are identified by direct methods as neutralization tests, IFAT or ELISA (OIE, 2001).",

Affected fish exhibited hyperplasia, hypertrophy, necrosis of epidermal cells and oedema in the gills. Infected cells contained intranuclear inclusion bodies and herpesvirus\u2010like particles of about 100 nm have been detected. Infection trials with the isolated agent induced mortality in lake trout but not in rainbow, brook and brown trout, or Atlantic and chinook salmon (Bradley et al., 1989). Observations of epizootics in fingerling and yearling of lake trout caused by EEDV were made in the Great Lakes area between 1983 and 1986 in the USA (McAllister and Herman, 1989). The steelhead herpesvirus (SHV, 231 nm) was isolated from ovarian fluid of steelhead trout (O. mykiss) in the USA. Low virulence appears in rainbow trout and chinook salmon. Infected fish show hepatocytic syncytia and Cowdry type A inclusion bodies. Vertical transmission of the virus is believed to occur, as SHV was detected in semen samples of steelhead trout. Serum cross\u2010neutralization tests, polypeptide composition and DNA sequence comparisons show that SHV is related to SaHV\u20101, but it differs in pathogenicity, transmission and host spectrum. SHV has proved not to be oncogenic (Eaton et al., 1989). Papillomatosis of cultured Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) observed in Russia and Scandinavia have been associated with herpesvirus\u2010like particles (200\u2013240 nm) (Wolf, 1988; Shchelkunov et al., 1992).",

Similar herpesvirus infection associated with epithelial skin tumours occurred in rainbow smelt (Osmerus mordax) in several lakes in the USA during spawning time, with a prevalence of 30% (Burke et al., 1989; Herman et al., 1997). Mass mortality of Japanese flounder (Paralichtys olivaceus) was found to be caused by a herpesvirus. The so\u2010called viral epidermal necrosis of flounders (VENF) is characterized by papillate cell aggregates in the epidermis and acidophilic cytoplasmic inclusion bodies filled up with herpesvirions (167\u2013190 nm) (Miyazaki et al., 1989). Another herpesvirus (167\u2013230 nm) of Japanese flounder was found, associated with epidermal hyperplasia of fin and skin (Iida et al., 1989). In contrast to VENF no cytoplasmic inclusion bodies, giant cells or syncytia were observed in infected flounder. Infection trials showed that both viruses induce mass mortality in the larvae of flounders (Miyazaki et al., 1989; Iida et al., 1989, 1991).

            "text": "\nLuck\u00e9 (1934) illustrated intranuclear inclusion bodies in renal adenocarcinoma of northern leopard frogs (Rana pipiens). Later a herpesvirus, the Luck\u00e9 tumour herpesvirus (LTHV, a syn. of ranid herpesvirus 1, RaHV\u20101), was isolated from the tumour\u2010bearing frogs (Lunger et al., 1965). The icosahedral virus has 162 capsomeres and measures about 100 nm in diameter. The viral aetiology of the frog adenocarcinoma was demonstrated and the agent was isolated using frog pronephric cells. Nuclear inclusions and development of virus were shown in explantats of inclusion\u2010free primary tumours kept at temperatures lower than 8\u00b0C. The RaHV\u20101 genome consists of a linear dsDNA (217 kbp) with GC content of 45\u201347% (Twedell, 1989). A 39.8\u2010kbp insert of a cosmid containing 12 genes homologous to ictalurid herpesvirus 1 genes was sequenced. Genes are present in two blocks, one of which is repeated, indicating similar organization to other fish herpesvirus genomes. Genes without counterparts in other herpesviruses, e.g. DNA (cytosine\u20105) methyltransferase, which plays a role in the replication and methylation of cellular DNA, were detected in RaHV\u20101. RaHV\u20101 is a distant relative of the fish herpesvirus lineage. It represents a third subdivision of this lineage, additional to those containing IcHV\u20101 and SaHV\u20101/2 (Davison et al., 1999). The virus induces primary tumours, malignancies by transformation of parenchymal cells of the kidney, forming an unencapsulated, locally invasive adenocarcinoma (Duryee, 1956). Tumours are present in frogs throughout the year, but the inclusion bodies and therefore virus replication are found only in animals kept at temperatures below 12\u00b0C. Metastatic nodules containing viral particles develop in the liver, lung, pancreas, fat body and urine bladder at 4\u00b0C (Twedell, 1989). Tumour cells still produce membrane antigen at higher temperatures, as shown by immunofluorescence. Transcripts of viral DNA are present in these tumours (Collard et al., 1973). A PCR for analysing a 1.2\u2010kbp HindII fragment (JH12) of RaHV\u20101 DNA has been established. RaHV\u20101\u2010specific DNA is detected in a significant percentage of normal kidneys as well as in virus\u2010free \u2018warm\u2019 tumours and virus\u2010containing \u2018cold\u2019 tumours. No viruses could be detected by electron microscopy in spontaneous tumours of frogs maintained under \u2018warm conditions\u2019 even though the \u2018virus\u2010free\u2019 (warm) tumours contain latent RaHV\u20101 (Carlson et al., 1994b, c;, McKinnell et al., 1995; \">Williams et al., 1996). Genome sequences required for tumourgenesis are unknown (Carlson et al., 1994a). RaHV\u20101 is able to rescue amphibian pronephros cells from apoptosis (Carlson et al., 1995).",

The causative agent (chelonid herpesvirus 4, ChHV\u20104) of the severe necrosis of the oral mucosa and glossitis was found in Argentinean tortoises (Geochelone chilensis) (Jacobson, 1986). Further reports have shown that the herpesvirus infection is common in Mediterranean tortoises (Posthaus et al., 1997). Mortality of 50% was recognized in a population of tortoises, consisting mainly of Hermann\u2019s tortoises (Testudo hermanni) and four\u2010toed tortoises (Agrionemys horsfieldii) (Cooper et al., 1988; Lange et al., 1989). During a spontaneous outbreak of stomatitis\u2013rhinitis complex with 50% mortality among T. hermanni in a collection of Mediterranean land tortoises (T. hermanni, T. graeca) in southern Germany, herpesviruses were isolated from dead T. hermanni. Neutralizing antibodies to chelonian herpesviruses were present in T. graeca. Testudo hermanni and T. horsfieldii seem to be more sensitive to the herpesvirus infection than spur\u2010thighed tortoises (T. graeca) and T. marginata (Kabisch and Frost, 1994; Marschang et al., 1997). There is evidence for the existence of two serotypes among herpesviruses of land tortoises (Biermann and Blahak, 1993; Kabisch and Frost, 1994). Acyclovir and gancyclovir inhibit virus replication in vitro (Marschang et al., 1997). The UL5 gene from a German CnHV\u20104 was sequenced. A digoxigenin\u2010labelled 307\u2010bp UL5 probe was used for in situ hybridization in tortoise tissue. Hybridization signals were detected in epithelial cells of lingual mucosa and glands, in the tracheal and renal epithelium, pneumocytes, hepatocytes, cerebral glial cells, neurones, and intramural intestinal ganglia. Systemic infection was found in tortoises of different geographical origin, indicating high conservation of the UL5 fragment (Teifke et al., 2000).",

            "text": "Green sea turtles (Chelonia mydas) suffering from cutaneous fibropapillomatosis (green turtle fibropapillomatosis, GTFP) were first reported in Florida (USA) over 60 years ago (Jacobson, 1986). GTFP emerged as a significant worldwide epizootic caused by green sea turtle fibropapillomatosis herpesvirus (GTFPHV) with high prevalence in green turtle populations. Lesions similar to the GTFP were observed in olive ridleys (Lepidochelys olivacea), flatbacks (Natator depressus), and loggerheads (Caretta caretta) (Herbst, 1994). Cases appeared in this species in Florida and at the Pacific coasts of Mexico and Costa Rica (Herbst, 1994; Aguirre et al., 1999). GTFPHV present in spontaneous and experimentally induced tumours measures 110\u2013125 nm. The virus resists cultivation in chelonian cell lines. The GTFP can be experimentally transmitted to young captive\u2010reared green turtles using cell\u2010free fibropapilloma extracts prepared from free\u2010ranging turtles (Herbst et al., 1995). Treatment of the inoculum with lipid solvents prior to inoculation destroys infectivity (Herbst et al., 1996). Serodiagnostics show a strong correlation between GTFP status in captive\u2010reared and free\u2010ranging turtles (Herbst et al., 1998). Consensus primer PCR is used to analyse the association of a chelonian herpesvirus with fibropapillomatosis. Degenerate PCR primers that target highly conserved regions of genes encoding herpesvirus DNA polymerases are used to amplify a DNA sequence of fibropapillomatosis cases from Hawaiian and Florida green turtles, loggerhead and olive ridley turtles. The herpesvirus appears to be generally limited to tumours (2\u20135 copies viral DNA/cell). Sequencing of the turtle herpesvirus DNA polymerase gene fragments (483 bp) shows that the GTFP agents are closely related and are intimately involved in the genesis of fibropapillomatosis (Quackenbush et al., 1998; Lackovich et al., 1999). A larger fragment (1632 bp) flanking the DNA polymerase gene of GTFPHV showed a high degree of homology with other mammalian and avian herpesviruses. Phylogenetic analysis confirmed that this herpesvirus belongs to the Alphaherpesvirinae subfamily and not to the fish herpesvirus lineage (Yu et al., 2000).",

For several viruses molecular data have been elaborated, but the knowledge of the viruses of lower vertebrates is still behind that of the viruses of homoiothermic vertebrates. The sequences of two herpesviruses, one iridovirus (LCDV), and an adenovirus originating from lower vertebrates have recently been published, but none of the systemic iridoviruses (genus Ranavirus), the parvo\u2010, pox\u2010 or polyomaviruses genomes have been analysed. Investigations on the molecular biology of severe viral pathogens in aquaculture, such as piscine rhabdoviruses, orthomyxoviruses, togaviruses and nodaviruses, certainly represent new tasks for the future. For example, information is needed to clarify the origin and evolution of viruses of lower vertebrates, to determine their taxonomic position, to analyse their viral biology, to prevent virus transmission, and to establish immune prophylaxis. RNA viruses usually undergo high mutation rates, therefore molecular data are needed in order to distinguish between virulent and avirulent strains. One of the most important tasks will be to establish proper vaccination trials. In addition, further investigations on virus transmission and vectors, viral receptors, and the viral host\u2019s immune modulation will open a new field in the established animal virology and give an insight in the complexity of viruses of lower vertebrates.",
