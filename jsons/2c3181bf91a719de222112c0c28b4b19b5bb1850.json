In veterinary medicine, this preeminence has not been established, but viral infection of the upper respiratory tract is certainly a common occurrence in dogs and cats kept under certain conditions. 1 In contrast, viral pneumonia is far less common than upper respiratory tract disease. Viral pneumonia may be defined as inflammation of the alveolar epithelium, pulmonary interstitium, and pulmonary capillary endothelium as a result of a primary viral infection. Commonly, the inflammatory processes in viral pneumonia also involve the terminal airways, and some infections that primarily cause bronchiolitis are also termed viral pneumonia.",

The term viral pneumonia should be reserved for cases in which involvement of the terminal airways and alveolar structures is substantial and predominant. When the bronchioles and parenchyma are largely unaffected, terms that describe the predominant site of injury are more appropriate (e.g., viral laryngotracheitis, bronchitis, or rhinitis).

            "text": "The most prevalent causative agents vary between species and with geographic location. In humans, the principal viral causes of pneumonia also vary with patient age and immune status. These factors may be of similar importance in dogs and cats but have not been widely studied. 2 Viral pneumonia is typically the result of an infection that gained access to the host by the inhaled or oropharyngeal route. Whereas fine aerosols containing viral particles are often generated in experimental studies, in naturally occurring disease the virus is typically spread within larger droplets of excretions and secretions. The lung parenchyma may become affected by direct invasion of respiratory epithelium via the airways. Alternatively, the lung may obtain its viral load secondary to viremia and blood-borne dissemination. Transplacental transmission of some respiratory viral pathogens has been described. 3 The primary causes of viral pneumonia in dogs are canine distemper virus (CDV), canine adenovirus type-II (CAV-2), and parainfluenza virus type-II (formerly parainfluenza SV5). 4, 5 Although reoviruses, coronaviruses, herpesviruses, and parvoviruses have all been recovered from dogs suffering from respiratory disease, their importance as causes of primary viral pneumonia is either limited or uncertain. 4, [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] In the cat, the predominant causes of primary viral pneumonia include feline herpesvirus (FHV-1), feline calicivirus (FCV), and poxvirus. 11, 12 Reoviruses have on occasion been recovered from cats with respiratory disease but are not thought to be a significant cause of pneumonia. Likewise, infection with either feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) or feline leukemia virus (FeLV) may result in some pulmonary involvement within the context of a systemic disease process, but pneumonia is not thought to be a common manifestation of those viral infections. [13] [14] [15] Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) infection can result in pulmonary granulomas but represents a pathologic process distinct from those of the viral pathogens to be discussed here. 16, 17 oropharyngeal route, some viruses replicate within the respiratory tract without dissemination (e.g., parainfluenza type-II), whereas others replicate in extrapulmonary sites before spreading to the respiratory epithelium (e.g., canine distemper virus).",

However, it is important to understand the course of events of pulmonary viral infection and how the distribution and nature of the lesions change over time. Initially, respiratory viruses injure bronchial, bronchiolar, and alveolar cells, and this initial injury leads to an influx of neutrophils. The direct injury and subsequent inflammatory response lead to the desquamation of epithelial cells, and the lumen of bronchioles and alveoli can become filled with desquamated cells, macrophages, mononuclear cells, and neutrophils.

In addition, many of the inflammatory cytokines produced in response to viral infection are vasoactive and can alter hypoxic vasoconstriction and further compromise ventilation and perfusion matching. 24 Infiltration of the interstitium and conversion to a type II pneumocyte alveolar epithelium can potentially diminish oxygen diffusion. The edematous and thickened alveolar septa reduce pulmonary compliance and increase the work of breathing. 25 Dyspnea may therefore be observed in the absence of hypoxemia. 26 Extrapulmonary signs of viral pneumonia may manifest if the virus infects tissues other than the lung or if the pulmonary insult results in a systemic inflammatory response.",

[28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] Viral pathogens can significantly impair pulmonary antibacterial defenses, both directly and indirectly. Viral infection can result in loss of ciliated epithelium from the conducting airways and thus compromise mucociliary clearance. Cellular desquamation and protein leakage can produce a suitable medium for bacterial growth in the airways. In addition, consolidated lung represents a relatively hypoxic environment that may indirectly impair bacterial defenses because many immune cells utilize oxygen-derived radicals to kill microbes. 34 Both canine adenovirus type II and parainfluenza have been shown to damage the respiratory epithelium and promote invasion by bacteria and mycoplasma. Several other mechanisms of viral-induced depression of antibacterial defenses have been proposed. Viral infection has been shown to enhance susceptibility to bacterial attachment and colonization, 36 and to diminish surfactant production. Macrophage chemotaxis, bacterial ingestion, and bacterial killing may all be diminished by concurrent viral infection. 33, 37 Viral infection has been experimentally shown to diminish pulmonary antibacterial defenses in a timedependent fashion. 38 In some models, bacterial defenses abruptly decline at day 7 to day 8 postviral infection, but are reestablished at day 9 to day 10. 38 The extent of depression appears to vary with the viral dose, and the most severe depression of antibacterial defenses appears to correlate with a period of rapidly declining viral titers.

Many dogs and cats spend little time in close contact with other members of their species except during early life. Lastly, some viruses capable of causing pneumonia may be passed from carriers to their offspring. Viral respiratory disease is often seen when many animals are housed together. Crowding, relatively poor ventilation, stress, and increased likelihood of exposure to carriers all can contribute to increased prevalence of respiratory disease. Upper respiratory disease in cats often occurs in catteries, boarding facilities, and shelters. Feline poxvirus pneumonia is more likely to occur in the late summer or early fall, 41 possibly because rodent carrier populations are highest during this period. Most canine viral respiratory disease occurs in shelters, labora-tory colonies, quarantine facilities, breeding colonies, and boarding kennels. One study of random-source dogs in a quarantine facility showed that respiratory disease developed in 52% of the dogs during the quarantine period. 5 Of the viral diseases identified in this population, distemper was the most common and most likely to be fatal.",

A history and clinical picture consistent with an infectious pneumonia can suggest a viral etiology when no other form of microorganism can be identified.

Poxvirus can nearly always be distinguished from the other causes of viral pneumonia based on accompanying skin lesions typical of that illness. 12 The pursuit of a specific viral diagnosis may be of more utility when faced with an outbreak rather than an isolated case. Identifying the virus responsible in such instances may help rational determination of appropriate isolation and prophylactic measures. For example, starting an early intranasal B. bronchiseptica/parainfluenza vaccination program in a breeding kennel is unlikely to alter the spread of an outbreak of distemper in that population. It may also be appropriate to pursue the specific identification of a viral pathogen when atypical signs are noted and one suspects a new strain or species may be responsible. Such investigations have led to the identification of strains with different tropisms, and also help in the formulation of future vaccines. Newer techniques becoming available, such as polymerase chain reaction, are of such high sensitivity that viral components can be isolated from many healthy animals.

Despite extensive vaccination of the at-risk population, significant disease caused by distemper is still seen. The illness likely persists because of the presence of unvaccinated carriers and the exposure of dogs to virus either before vaccination or before protective antibody titers develop. Outbreaks of disease within vaccinated populations have been described. 42, 43 Distemper is caused by a virus related to the human measles virus and is classified as a morbillivirus. The viral genome is in the form of RNA and the entire genome has been sequenced. 44 Exposure is generally thought to occur via aerosol and fine droplets. The virus initially replicates in lymphoid tissues such as the tonsils and bronchial lymph nodes. Following initial viral replication, viremia develops and the virus spreads to more peripheral lymphoid tissues. Another period of viral replication occurs within the peripheral lymphoid tissue. Distemper virus is pantropic and invades a wide range of tissue and cell types. The virus often targets epithelial cells, and many of the clinical signs of the disease reflect viral infection of epithelial surfaces and secondary bacterial invasion. Infection of the central nervous system often leads to the clinical signs of acute encephalitis and may also result in chronic disease. 45, 46 Distemper infection is immunosuppressive because of both lympholysis and alteration of cytokine responses.

The diversity of clinical signs observed reflects both the pantropism of the virus and the profound immunosuppression it can induce. Distemper has been shown in experimental infections to cause a biphasic fever (around day 5 and around day 11 postinoculation), but the initial febrile period may often be missed in clinical disease. 7, 53, 54 Gastrointestinal signs can include both vomiting and diarrhea. Signs of respiratory involvement may include cough, dyspnea, and a mucopurulent oculonasal discharge. Weight loss and dehydration may be substantial. Neurologic signs are variable and may include myoclonus, seizures, and vision loss. Some of the classic signs of distemper such as hyperkeratosis of the footpads are more chronic manifestations of the disease, and are seldom present at the time pneumonia is most likely to develop. This description of clinical signs is that of a classic distemper case, but distemper can mimic a variety of other diseases and cases seldom fit a textbook picture. Regarding the pulmonary manifestations of distemper, the virus should be high on the differential list if pneumonia is present in the face of lymphopenia, neurologic signs, ocular signs, or a recent history of exposure to a multi-dog environment such as a shelter. Similarly, if an overwhelming infection with a relatively uncommon parasite is diagnosed, concurrent distemper infection should be considered. 55, 56 Diagnostic Testing",

The chemistry profile, complete blood count, and urinalysis may have few changes, particularly in the acute stages of the disease. Depending on the viral strain involved, a significant lymphopenia may be noted. Thoracic radiographs may initially show a diffuse interstitial pattern that progresses to a diffuse bronchial and alveolar pattern if secondary bacterial bronchopneumonia develops or if pulmonary necrosis is extensive. Eosinophilic viral inclusion bodies in the nucleus or cytoplasm of leukocytes, erythrocytes, or epithelial cells may support the tentative diagnosis ( Figure  58 -1). [57] [58] [59] Definitive diagnosis may be made using immunohistochemistry ( Figure 58 -2), viral isolation, or polymerase chain reaction amplification of unique viral sequences of nucleic acid. [60] [61] [62] [63] [64] Heparinized blood is considered the best sample on which to attempt viral isolation, but distemper can be a challenging virus to grow in the laboratory. Electron microscopy of tissue samples can identify viral particles but has low sensitivity and is not specific. ELISA-based assays for both distemper-specific antibodies and viral antigen have also been used successfully and offer a more rapid alternative to virus neutralization assays. 65, 66 Serum antibody titers may at times be misleading because of the immunosuppression produced by distemper infection and widespread vaccination of dogs for this disease.",

Further, it has been shown that the administration of 200,000 IU per day of vitamin A for 2 days to children suffering from measles can reduce overall mortality as well as pneumoniaspecific mortality. 80 The use of vitamin A as an adjunct therapy in the treatment of distemper pneumonia bears further investigation.",

Acute and convalescent titers can be obtained, but in most cases of CAV-2 respiratory disease the patient will be fully recovered before convalescent titers are drawn.

Exposure is via inhalation or ingestion of saliva, excretions, or secretions from shedding cats. Direct contact is a more important route of exposure than inhalation of fine aerosols. The virus persists long enough in the environment that indirect exposure is likely possible in multi-cat environments. Coinfection with either FIV or FHV increases the severity of the disease.",

Dyspneic cats should be provided with supplemental oxygen. When pneumonia is present, antibiotics should be administered. As in FHV-1 infection, tetracyclines are an appropriate class of antibiotic to start with until sensitivity results are available. No specific antiviral medications are available for the treatment of caliciviral infections in cats. Ribavirin has in vitro activity against calicivirus but in vivo produced more severe illness in calicivirus infected cats. 135, 136 The cornerstone of prevention is the routine vaccination of household cats. Several parenteral vaccines (both modified live virus and inactivated adjuvanted virus) are available. Vaccine schedules follow those for FHV-1. Newer vaccines continue to be developed. Intranasal vaccines can be given if a cat is about to enter a high-risk environment such as a boarding facility. However, the intranasal route is more likely to produce side effects such as signs of upper respiratory tract inflammation. In board-ing facilities, cats from different households should be housed separately. Physical barriers and a distance of at least a meter should separate cats from different homes. Cats can sneeze macrodroplets of respiratory secretions to a distance of nearly 2 meters. Thorough cleaning of housing as well as food and water bowls is essential.",

The initial presenting complaint is typically multifocal skin lesions. The appearance of the lesions is variable; they can be mistaken for cat bite abscesses or eosinophilic granulomas. Samples of the skin lesions can be evaluated microscopically for the presence of eosinophilic cytoplasmic inclusion bodies. Fluorescent antibodies can be applied to samples of the skin lesions to detect cowpox antigens. Material from skin lesions can also be submitted for virus isolation. Serum antibody titers are generally diagnostic because the disease is not widespread in cats and vaccines are not available.

Although these viruses can produce pneumonia, they generally only do so in severe cases or when the patient is immunocompromised. Canine distemper is unique in this regard because this virus can itself produce significant immune suppression. For this reason canine distemper is more likely to produce clinically significant viral pneumonia than most other agents. Viral strains vary in their tropism, and those that favor pneumocytes are more likely to produce interstitial pneumonia when they gain access to the lower respiratory tract. Viral infections of the lung typically produce a pattern of lesions termed bronchointerstitial pneumonia. Early lesions are predominantly centered on the airways and may be purulent. Over time the primary focus of the lesions becomes alveolar, and interstitial and mononuclear infiltrates are typical. Viral pneumonia in dogs is largely because of canine distemper virus, canine adenovirus type II, and parainfluenza virus type II. In cats, viral pneumonia is typically the result of infection with feline herpesvirus-I or feline calicivirus, although in Western Europe feline cowpox pneumonia has been noted. Viral infection can suppress pulmonary antibacterial defenses, and secondary bacterial pneumonia is common. Treatment of viral pneumonia is generally supportive although a few antiviral agents warrant consideration in the treatment of dogs and cats. The prognosis for viral pneumonia is often good although systemic illness, secondary bacterial infections, and coinfection with other viruses can lead to worsening of the outcome.",
