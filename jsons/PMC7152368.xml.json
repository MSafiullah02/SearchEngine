Each half can move independently, allowing camelids to fastidiously investigate potential food sources and then to procure choice foods. With its tactile qualities and mobility, this upper lip plays some of the role of the tongue in traditional ruminants. The lower lip is less mobile and less sensitive than the upper lip.",

Salivary chloride concentration is very low (20 to 30 mEq/L). A slight increase in bicarbonate concentration occurs during feeding. Total fasting salivary output is approximately 6 milliliters per kilogram per hour [mL/kg/hr], with each parotid salivary gland secreting about 2 mL/kg/hr.6, 7 Both parotid and total salivary outputs increase by over 50% during eating and cud chewing. On the basis of this information, camelid saliva appears to have similar biochemical features to ruminant saliva, and probably plays an important role in buffering gastric acid. The rate of saliva production in camelids is also similar to that in roughage-fed ruminants. However, the parotid glands of camelids are proportionally similar in mass to those of ruminants adapted to poorly fermentable diets and approximately one third the size of the glands of ruminants adapted to rich diets.9 This suggests that camelids have limited ability to increase salivary buffering of fermentation in response to higher rates of forestomach acid production.",

Initial mastication by camelids is cursory and consists of only enough chewing to mix the food with saliva to form a bolus for swallowing. To further decrease particle size and increase surface area for microbial digestion, cud is propelled from the first gastric compartment back up the esophagus into the mouth, where it is rechewed and mixed with saliva. This process has been studied extensively in the vicu\u00f1a and probably is similar in other camelids.10 After regurgitation of a cud, the mandible makes a \u201cfigure-of-8\u201d arc during chewing. In approximately 15 seconds, 25 to 30 chews occur, after which the cud is swallowed. The cycle may repeat itself many times. In contrast to ruminants, which tend to retain a cud on one side for several chews, camelids appear to move the cud from side-to-side with each chew.9 Saliva is expelled primarily from the ipsilateral parotid duct each time, potentially minimizing salivary loss and maximizing the contribution of both glands to the digestive process.",

The squamous epithelium of the forestomach is keratinized in camels, but not in New World camelids.17, 18 No structures are analogous to the frondular papillae that ruminants have extending into the forestomach lumen (Figure 40-6\n). Instead, camelids have two types of specialized structures that evaginate from the forestomach lumen: (1) the glandular saccules of C1 and (2) the glandular cells of C2. The saccules of C1 are found in two groups, one on each side of the transverse pillar. Each group is arranged in rows. The smaller group is found at the cranioventral aspect of the cranial sac, and the larger group is found immediately caudal to the transverse pillar on the ventral surface of the caudal sac. The rows are divided by muscular primary septa, which are much more prominent in the caudal sac, where they are contiguous with and perpendicular to the transverse pillar. The saccules in each row are separated by smaller secondary septa. In the middle rows of each group, two saccules usually are present side-by-side between the primary septa, divided by a small tertiary septum and occasionally a quarternary septum. Each saccule has a very small orifice (about 5 millimeters [mm] in an adult llama) controlled by a muscular diaphragm protecting a wider saccular lumen (about 10 mm). The saccules of the caudal sac alone account for half the surface area of the first compartment.7 The saccules are visible as bumps along the serosal surfaces of the gastric compartments or as evaginations when viewed from the mucosal side.",

The camelid saccules contain small quantities of gastric fluid in small pockets surrounded by highly absorptive epithelium and constantly renew this fluid through saccular eversion and refilling. The high rate of contractions, the high surface area-to-volume ratio, and long particle retention times of the camelid forestomach may be responsible for the digestive advantage that camelids have over ruminants with regard to poor-quality forage.14, 20, 21 The papillae of ruminants also help preserve the ruminal environment through absorption and removal of organic acids from the lumen. This is especially important when VFAs are produced in large quantities, as occurs when a highly fermentable feed is provided. The size of the papillae and surface area increase, over time and with limitations, when VFA production is high, allowing faster removal of VFAs. Thus, the ruminant can adapt itself to higher energy feeds by increasing the rate of acid removal. We do not know if the saccules of camelids are capable of similar adaptation, and our belief is that they are not. Thus, camelids may be less adapted to handle high energy feeds compared with their ruminant counterparts. This is contrary to the popular belief that camelids are resistant to this type of feed-related disease.",

Saccular fluid has a higher bicarbonate concentration than forestomach fluid, and this bicarbonate concentration increases with time if the saccules are exposed to chloride-rich or VFA-rich solutions.7, 8 This has led to one theory that bicarbonate is secreted across the saccular membrane into the forestomach in exchange for chloride to buffer the acids produced by fermentation. A similar function has been described for the cells of the gastric cardia of monogastrics, which secrete bicarbonate in exchange for chloride from hydrochloric acid to protect that region from acid damage. The problems with extrapolating this function to camelids are twofold: (1) The gastric saccules are rarely exposed to high chloride concentrations because the chloride concentration in the forestomach fluid of camelids is normally very low (less than 20 mEq/L); and (2) it would be unusual to assume that an animal adapted to a low nutrient environment would have developed a mechanism to protect itself against overingestion of rapidly fermentable nutrients.",

VFA, although a weak acid, usually exists in its ionized form at typical C1 pH. The ionized form crosses the lipid cellular membrane with difficulty, but if it momentarily captures the hydrogen molecule from carbonic acid, it is removed from the system by absorption across the saccular membrane. This leaves the bicarbonate molecule within the saccular fluid, which explains the high bicarbonate concentration at the site of VFA absorption and perceived secretion into the saccular fluid and would be compatible with our understanding of normal conditions in the camelid stomach.",

In guanacos, the C1 contractions move from caudoventral to caudodorsal, followed by a cranial sac contraction.27 In alpacas, the whole caudal sac appears to contract together.26 A final weak contraction of the canal ends the cycle. The entire sequence takes about 1 to 2 minutes. Clinical interpretation of multiple contraction cycles during that time results from interpretation of the multiple C1 contractions of a single A-cycle as multiple cycles. The A-cycle is responsible for fluid passage into C3 (during the first C2 contraction only), expressing fluid from the fiber mass, and mixing of the contents of C1. Experimental data from one llama revealed that fluid passage into C3 occurs at a rate of approximately 7 mL/kg/hr, with about 0.14 mL/kg passing through the canal with each A-cycle.28 The order of contraction of the various parts of caudal C1 is still being debated, but the overall effect is slow counter-clockwise rotation of the ingesta, when viewed from the left.",

The B-cycle lasts about 9 seconds and may be repeated several times before the next A-cycle. The B-cycle primarily aids in mixing of digesta, expressing fluid from the fiber mass, and renewing the saccular contents but generally does not stimulate passage of fluid into C3. Rumination and eructation of gas each occur during some B-cycles. If the camelid inspires with a closed glottic prior to the contraction of cranial C1, ingesta is drawn into the esophagus by negative intrathoracic pressure, and propelled to the mouth by an antiperistaltic wave of contraction of the esophageal musculature.29 Eructation is accomplished by an additional contracture of caudodorsal C1 at the end of the B-cycle. Up to approximately 100 A- and B-cycles may occur in an hour during eating and rumination, but both cycles may be absent for 10 to 20 minutes at a time when the camelid is not ruminating.",

Mechanical distension of distal C3 appears to inhibit A-cycles and stimulate B-cycles, although its effects on A-cycles are inconsistent. The clinical relevance of these effects is that forestomach distension stimulates gastric mixing and rumination but not necessarily gastric outflow, whereas distension of the terminal fermentative stomach (distal C3) alone promotes aborad flow of ingesta. Clinical experiences support that pathologic distension of the gastric compartments inhibits motility as in ruminants, although this effect has not been verified experimentally.",

The jejunum begins a short distance cranial to the root of the mesentery, and its abundant loops occupy most of the right dorsal abdomen. The proximal two thirds of the jejunum consist of tight coils on a short mesenteric attachment (5\u20137 cm). These loops are difficult to exteriorize through an incision.

A sterile teat cannula is introduced perpendicular to the skin through the incision into the abdomen, and fluid s collected by gravity flow into a Na-EDTA (sodium\u2013ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) tube for cytologic analysis and a clot tube for bacteriologic culture (Figure 40-10\n). Heparinized fluid may be collected for immediate biochemical analysis. This technique is successful in about 95% of camelids, with unintentional gastrocentesis rarely occurring because of the sideways orientation of the cannula. The procedure may be done with the patient standing in the kush position or in left lateral recumbency.",

Adequate physical restraint is necessary, and chemical sedation may facilitate the procedure.

Recently, florfenicol (20 mg/kg, SQ, q48h for 10 treatments), isoniazid (20 mg/kg, orally [PO], q24h for 4 to 12 weeks), and long-acting ceftiofur crystalline free acid (6.6 mg/kg, SQ, q7d for 6 weeks) have shown promise as more convenient yet effective treatments. Although it has not been reported in New World camelids, isoniazid has been associated with fatal marrow suppression in camels.56 As an adjunct to antibiotic therapy, draining tracts should be flushed with antiseptic solutions and possibly curetted out.

If the obstruction does not resolve, with the camelid tranquilized and restrained with its head depressed below the level of the thoracic inlet, a regular or cuffed stomach tube may be introduced to the level of the obstruction. Water or air may be used to distend the esophagus or break up the mass, or the mass may be pushed gently into the stomach. Alternatively, the mass may be picked apart using the endoscope and biopsy tool. If success is not achieved in 15 to 30 minutes, the amount of effort seems excessive, or the camelid is becoming unduly stressed, the procedure should be halted and the camelid allowed to recover without food or water for an hour or two. If the camelid becomes dehydrated, intravenous (IV) fluids should be administered, possibly with supplemental bicarbonate to correct acidosis. If aspiration is suspected, an aggressive course of broad-spectrum antibiotics and antiinflammatory agents should be administered. After resolution, endoscopic evaluation of the esophageal mucosa is helpful in assessing the risk for strictures, and further workup may be helpful in investigating underlying disorders.",

Because of the importance of concerted muscular activity during swallowing and regurgitation, lesions of the vagus, its offshoots, and the muscles it innervates are suspected in most cases. Neck trauma caused by fight wounds, dog bite wounds, running through fences, electroshock collars, or other penetrating injuries appears to be the principal identifiable cause of cervical esophageal neuromuscular dysfunction. Trauma from overly invasive venipuncture or jugular catheterization attempts could potentially be causative, but this has not been confirmed.

The earliest sign is mild salivation, probably induced by a cud which failed to make it past the lesion.43 The next sign is often cud loss, probably induced when the camelid loses track of a cud while it passes through the lesion (Figure 40-21\n). Other signs which appear in the first few weeks or months are recurrent choke and the development of a palpable or visible recurrent or persistent fluid wave in the left ventral neck. The distended esophagus may be palpable. Weight loss is progressive, and feed aspiration is always a risk. Respiratory sounds may be abnormal with aspiration. Also, gurgling of gas and fluid in the esophagus may sound like GI sounds in the thorax.",

Even if a primary obstructive lesion is identified, correction of that may not occur within the time necessary to prevent the secondary muscle damage to the esophagus. Because camelids with megaesophagus have more difficulty with regurgitation than with swallowing, feeding from a height may aid in keeping the esophagus clear of food but is unlikely to help during rumination. The most beneficial treatment appears to be feeding highly digestible, small particle feedstuffs such as complete pelleted feeds or alfalfa pellets from a bucket raised above the level of the back in small quantities frequently. Others report success with long-stem hay. Frequently, it is a matter of finding a feedstuff that the camelid tolerates without developing choke and then monitoring weight. Camelids that lose weight have an understandably worse prognosis than those that do not.

If large particles pass this sphincter, they are frequently trapped in the saccular lumen. Wedge-shaped grains, particularly sunflower seeds, appear more prone to do this. Once in the lumen, mineral is laid around the objects, forming stones (Figure 40-25\n). These stones, with the indigenous name \u201cluan cura,\u201d were once purported to be of medicinal value to humans.63, 64 They invariably contain a nidus of plant material, usually a seed surrounded by a mineralized matrix, and may be seen as checkerboard rows of mineral densities on radiography of the abdomen. Wires and other foreign bodies that get trapped in the saccules undergo similar mineralization, perhaps preventing penetrating injury. The outer surface of mineralized objects may be smooth or rough and yellow-green or black in color. The size usually varies from about 5 mm to 30 mm per side, although kilogram-weight stones have also been described. Mineral analyses of such bezoars at our laboratory and elsewhere have suggested that they may contain different layers of mineral and consist mainly of calcium or magnesium phosphate salts.65 It has been suggested that the microenvironment of the saccule contributes to magnesium phosphate salt crystallization because of the high bicarbonate and phosphate concentrations in saccular fluid and that the bezoar helps maintain this microenvironment by blocking evacuation of the saccule during forestomach contraction. Small bezoars may initially act as valves that occlude outflow and prevent saccular eversion and large bezoars often completely fill the saccular lumen and may eventually rupture through.",

However, as addressed in the previous discussion of physiology, camelids appear to lack capacity to increase salivary buffering or gastric surface area substantially, and claims for enhanced forestomach buffering were probably overrated. Additionally, as camelids appear to absorb most of the VFA in its ionized state, the higher acidity and higher percentage of unionized VFA may not enhance absorption, as it does in ruminants.

Correction of dehydration and systemic acidosis is critical, as is prevention of continued forestomach acid production and systemic absorption. Treatment with IV fluids containing bicarbonate based on the calculated deficit and cold oral fluids containing magnesium hydroxide (up to 1.25 mg/kg per dose) usually is adequate, although gastric lavage or gastrotomy may be necessary with severe disease, or if IV fluids are impractical. Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs; flunixin meglumine, 0.5 to 1.1 mg/kg, IV, q8-24h) may be helpful to treat toxemia and shock. Treatment with antibiotics (penicillin or ceftiofur at standard doses) and thiamine HCl (10 mg/kg, IM or IV, up to q4h) also are recommended to prevent secondary complications. When gastrotomy is not performed, it is possible, but rare, for acidosis and associated clinical signs to recur over the next 72 hours, as further gastric fermentation occurs. Gastric transfaunation 2 to 3 days after the initial episode may help restore a more normal microbial population. Most affected animals survive with treatment. A small percentage become chronic poor-doers with hypoproteinemia and weight loss, most likely due to deep, nonhealing ulceration of the gastric mucosa (Figure 40-28\n).",

Most case reports describe camelids with chronic diseases, and it is impossible to determine when in the course of the illness the ulcer developed, and what role it played in disease signs.70, 71, 72 The pathogenesis likewise remains a speculation. The third gastric compartment is long and tubular, running craniocaudal in the right ventral abdomen. Within the first two thirds to 80% of its length, fermentative digestion takes place, and the pH is approximately 6.4. At its caudal extreme, where the organ abruptly turns dorsal and cranial, a small region of hydrochloric acid secretion exists. Peptic ulcers typically occur at this caudal flexure or near the pylorus and into the cranial duodenum, areas where the luminal contents are most acidic or subsequently neutralized (Figure 40-29\n). Most ulcers occur along the greater curvature. The usual suspects\u2014stress, high grain diets, NSAIDs, and concurrent diseases\u2014have been suggested as possible causes, but most camelids known to have ulcers do not have good evidence of any of these. Through retrospective study of case records, we have identified seven historical factors associated with perforating GI ulcers; it is likely that others exist and that some factors vary in importance with geographic location. These specific factors are (1) frequent harassment by a dominant camelid, (2) recent transport, (3) recent delivery of a cria (this may relate to transport, as this was most frequently seen in camelids that delivered on one property and were subsequently moved to another), (4) grazing lush spring pasture, (5) enteritis or septicemia, (6) GI foreign body, and (7) bowel ischemia. The last three factors were associated with focal ulceration and perforation at any point along the gastrointestinal tract while the first three were associated with third compartment or proximal duodenal ulceration. In addition to these factors, forestomach acidosis may cause nonperforating, but severe, ulceration in the forestomach and mild ulceration in the third gastric compartment. GI tumors are associated with focal nonperforating ulceration at any point in the GI tract, and copper poisoning may cause massive, diffuse gastric ulceration. Factors associated with nonfatal, nonperforating ulcers are unknown, but it should be noted that chronic disease conditions, hospital stays, and long-term and short-term treatment with NSAIDs were not identified as risk factors for perforating ulcers.",

In normal camelids, fermented ingesta frequently move into the fundic region, diluting the hydrochloric acid, and the mixture is regularly expelled into the pyloric region and duodenum, where the acids should be neutralized. With poor progressive motility, the acid contents remain unneutralized and possibly damage the mucosa. Most of the identified risk factors such as anorexia or intermittent eating (as may occur with sick, transported, or bullied camelids), dehydration, electrolyte or acid-base abnormalities, and gastric hyperacidity (feeding too much grain, or even overindulgence on lush spring grass) could plausibly be linked to poor gastric emptying.

Clinical presentation relates to the nature of the lesion. Nonperforating ulcers are usually blamed for causing anemia, depression, inappetence, colic, sensitivity to right cranioventral abdominal palpation, recumbency, and death in camelids of all ages, as in the clinical disorders associated with these lesions in horses, cattle, and humans. However, the reality is that most nonperforating ulcers are clinically silent, even when extensive. Camelids show those particular signs with a multitude of disorders (or in complete health in the case of resenting palpation) and rarely show any signs, except perhaps mild anemia, with ulceration. Chronic ulceration, sometimes with replacement of the entire acid-secreting mucosa by granulation tissue, is an exception, often leading to weeks or months of progressive ill-thrift. Fecal occult blood tests are not a reliable method of diagnosing nonperforating gastric ulcers, and melena is more common with gastric masses or massive ulceration caused by copper toxicosis.

On the basis of the identified risk factors and putative pathogenesis, correction of underlying diseases, maintenance of good mucosal blood flow and gastric emptying, and avoiding causes of stress or anorexia are probably the best way to avoid and treat nonperforating gastric ulcers. Palatable, forage-based rations may be prokinetic, epitheliotropic, and nonacidogenic. Fluids should support mucosal health and good GI function. Analgesic medications may increase appetite and decrease pain-mediated ileus. Effective management, with readily available food and water and a noncompetitive environment, is the cornerstone. Philosophically, the practitioner needs to decide whether all sick or at-risk (bullied, new introductions, transported, competing breeding males) camelids need preemptive intervention or if the lack of effective treatments or infrequency of clinical progression (most perforations occur in outwardly healthy camelids, not poor-doers) precludes the use of specific antiulcer treatments. Following the principles of promoting healthy gastric emptying suitably addresses both circumstances. Prophylactic and therapeutic goals of restoring or maintaining perfusion; acid\u2013base, mineral, and electrolyte homeostasis; and physical stimulation of progressive gastric motility through the regular provision of good-quality roughage that the camelid can eat comfortably and throughout the day appear to minimize the chance of perforation and perhaps the prevalence of nonperforating ulceration.",

Overall, the prognosis for camelids with perforated ulcers is grave. As ulcers have been seen occasionally in small outbreaks, if one camelid in a herd develops a perforation, the others should be scrutinized for risk and treated accordingly.",

Lymphoma more commonly affects the caudal end of the third compartment (Figure 40-32\n) but may also affect the first or second compartment and appears to be common in all ages of camelid. Other neoplasms, particularly carcinomas of glandular tissue and sarcomas of smooth muscle origin, occur sporadically and also tend to occur in older adults. In general, neoplastic disorders cause gradual weight loss with progressive anemia, hypoproteinemia, lethargy, and anorexia. Melena is occasionally seen when gastric ulceration is severe. Diarrhea might be noted early in the course of the disease or terminally. Lymphoma may cause palpable masses on other body parts; it is covered more extensively in Chapter 36. Often, the early clinical signs are missed, and the llama is either found dead or extremely debilitated. Antemortem diagnosis and successful treatment of malignant internal neoplasms are rare but could be improved by earlier identification of the sick animal, greater awareness of the tumors, and a diagnostic workup directed toward neoplastic disorders.",

As with some other clostridial diseases, the question remains whether Clostridia are primary pathogens or secondary invaders that cause easily recognizable and usually lethal disease. Clostridial organisms are gram-positive, motile, spore-forming, facultatively anaerobic rods. They may be present in low numbers in the gut contents of healthy animals and proliferate under certain conditions. High fermentable carbohydrate in gastric contents and slow gut transit are generally thought to promote clostridial overgrowth. Clostridial organisms are also toxin producers, and slowed transit or organism overgrowth may allow these toxins to reach pathogenic concentrations. Other diseases may facilitate clostridial disease by slowing gut transit, changing the gut microbial population, or damaging the mucosa to allow for clostridial invasion and greater systemic absorption of the toxins. Specifically, peptic ulcers or gastric nematodes are thought to facilitate gastric disease, and nematodes, coronavirus, Giardia, and coccidia are thought to facilitate intestinal disease.81, 82\n",

These cause disease in camelids much as they do in domestic ruminants, that is, by erosion and ulceration of the gastric mucosa, and by destruction of the gastric pits. Infection starts when third-stage (L3) larvae are ingested and burrow into the gastric mucosa. They shed their cuticle to molt into L4 larvae within a few days and begin to feed on blood (mainly Haemonchus) or proteinaceous exudates. Maturation into adults may occur within 3 to 4 weeks or be delayed for several months (hypobiosis, arrested development); that is, the prepatent period, and potentially prepatent disease, may extend over several months. With most of these parasites, two main types of disease exist: (1) type 1 infestation, which is caused by larvae and adult worms soon after ingestion of large numbers of infective larvae, and (2) type 2 disease, which occurs upon massive resumption of growth of arrested L4 larvae. Although type 2 disease is the focus of the scant reports, both types are seen in clinical practice.88, 89\n",

Within this vacuole, the organism is shielded from both the gut lumen environment and intracellular defenses, and presumably from many chemotherapeutic agents. Cryp\u00adtosporidium also develops a unique feeder organelle membrane on the inner side of the vacuole to facilitate nutrient uptake from the host cell. They mature to trophozoites, and multiply asexually (schizogony). These new forms (merozoites) are released into the gut lumen, where some of them reattach to epithelial cells and repeat the cycle of multiplication. Others, upon entry into the brush border of a new epithelial cell, mature into Type II meronts, which release Type II merozoites. These invade new cells and mature into the male (microgamont) and female (macrogamont) forms. Microgametes from the microgamonts are released to penetrate macrogamonts, effecting non-multiplicative, sexual reproduction. Fertilized zygotes mature to oocysts. Cryptosporidium is relatively unique among coccidia, in that 20% of oocyst are thin-walled and likely to rupture within the GI tract, and that thick-walled oocysts are usually sporulated, and hence infective, immediately on passage. Rupture of thin-walled oocysts releases a new round of sporozoites and starts the process of infection over. This can repeat until inhibited by the host immune response.",

Adult herdmates occasionally develop diarrhea at the same time as the cria outbreaks, and may at that time be found to be positive on fecal examination; isolated adult cases have been seen as well. Hence, adults must be considered a possible, if minor, source of infection. Larger herds with a large number of births close together are most likely to have outbreaks of cryptosporidiosis, presumably due to passage between camelids. In smaller herds with sporadic cases, other infected species may by introducing the parasite. The fecal material at presentation varies in consistency from watery to pasty, and in color from white, yellow, or green, to tan or green if crias were old enough to be grazing. Other clinical signs of affected crias include reduced fecal production, lethargy, weakness, reduced gastrointestinal sounds, failure to thrive, weight loss to emaciation, and abdominal pain. Relapses often occur after 4 to 7 days of improvement. These are due to autoinfection, a reinitiation of infection by thin-walled cysts in the gut. In crias with diarrhea, common clinicopathologic abnormalities include acidemia, hyperlactemia, azotemia, and hyperglycemia and high aspartate transaminase and gamma-glutamyltransferase activities.104 It is interesting to note that whereas evidence of sodium and chloride loss are common in calves with clinical cryptosporidiosis, they are inconsistent findings in crias, emphasizing the need for a good diagnostic evaluation before initiating treatment, when possible.",

High concentrations of na\u00efve hosts can lead to rapid environmental build-up of infective oocysts; overcrowding, environmental fecal contamination, and eating off the ground contribute to risk. Pathogenicity may relate to size: E. lamae is reported to be the most damaging small coccidia,109 and there is increasing evidence that E. macusaniensis is the most damaging overall (Figure 40-34\n). The propensity for neonatal or juvenile disease may relate to the parasite's ability to survive the functional forestomach and the host's immune response. In environments where these parasites are common, early exposure is essentially guaranteed, and continued reinfection likely promotes a vigorous immune response in survivors.110, 111 In those environments, disease is most common in the na\u00efve crias, which may shed pass-through oocysts within 5 days of birth. In cleaner environments, level of exposure is less certain, and some camelids may remain na\u00efve and susceptible into adulthood. In all cases, overwhelming exposure, often facilitated in individual animals (newcomers to a herd) eating off the ground, or compromise of the immune response may allow disease, even in older animals.",

The small coccidia are relatively conventional in appearance and life cycle, and will be familiar to anyone acquainted with coccidial disease in domestic poultry or ruminants. The large coccidia of camelids are relatively unique. The small coccidia include, by increasing size of oocysts, Eimeria punoensis (17 to 22\u00b5 in length), E. alpacae (22 to 26\u00b5), and E. lamae (30 to 40\u00b5).112 Oocysts become more ovoid as the species gets larger, so that E. punoensis is about 16% longer than it is wide without a clearly visible polar cap (by standard light microscopy), whereas E. lamae is about 60% longer than it is wide and has an obvious cap (Figure 40-35\n). These follow the same general lifecycle as Cryptosporidium with a few notable exceptions. Eimeria oocysts are not thin-walled and are not capable of autoinfection. They do not sporulate and become infective until they have spent 4 to 12 days (for E. lamae) or more outside of the host.111, 113 After ingestion, sporulated oocysts usually release 8 sporozoites, which penetrate epithelial cells. The host cell nucleus and organelles are marginalized and the cell ruptures with maturation of each parasitic stage. Thus, mucosal loss can be widespread, particularly during the early, multiplicative stages of infection. The prepatent periods are approximately 10 days for E. punoensis,114 15\u201316 days for E. lamae,109 and 16\u201318 days for E. alpacae.114\n",

In younger camelids, gastroenteritis is more likely to result in clinical diarrhea, whereas in older camelids, diarrhea is often absent or easy to miss. In fact, in adults, it is frequently counterintuitive to directly link the presenting signs to GI illness. In addition to or instead of diarrhea, general signs include weight loss or poor weight gain, ill-thrift, and increasing lethargy, weakness, and loss of appetite. It is one of the most common causes for weakness, weight loss, hypoproteinemia, or ill-thrift in our area. Some animals show colic signs, probably more with E. macusaniensis than with any other parasitic gastroenteritis, and coccidioisis may contribute to some intestinal accidents.126, 127 As the disease progresses, hypoproteinemia worsens without commensurate anemia; mild anemia is common, but hypoproteinemia and hypoalbuminemia often become severe (such as 3.8 to 2.2 mg/dl for serum total protein and 1.8 to 0.6 mg/dl for serum albumin concentrations). There is also often some reduction in serum sodium and chloride concentrations, and hypokalemia becomes more marked with anorexia. With worsening disease, the animal becomes susceptible to translocation of bacteria or toxins through the damaged mucosa, the effects of hypoproteinemia, and circulatory shock. Signs of other organ systems are seen: camelids may develop ascites, hydrothorax, hydropericardium, pharyngeal edema, and cerebral edema, with ensuing abdominal distention, increased respiratory effort, lethargy, tachycardia, hypothermia, dysphagia, salivary loss, and cerebral signs. Eventually, there is also clinicopathologic evidence of the systemic disease including azotemia, metabolic (usually lactic) acidosis, high liver enzyme activity, hyperbilirubinemia, and increases in blood fat fractions. Abdominocentesis usually yields a transudate. Abdominal imaging is also inconclusive: colicky camelids may have ileus and fluid-distended intestine, though usually to a lesser degree than camelids with GI obstruction. Overtly thickened bowel wall is rare (<10% of cases). In some cases, signs are insidious, and the animal is simply found dead.",

Strategic use of anticoccidial drugs may also be considered as a supplemental means of controlling coccidiosis. Since outbreaks of coccidiosis are common in the wetter months, prophylactic drug regimes should be used during these times of year, especially if they coincide with the first 6 months of a newborn's life. Consideration should be given to application of preventative measures before and during stressful events such as weaning, shearing, or herd movements. Treatment medications may be used intermittently for control. Alternatively, decoquinate may be added into feed at 0.5mg/kg/day for 28 days. Use of ionophore antibiotics such as monensin or salinomycin is discouraged without further research regarding safety and efficacy, because they have been associated with toxicosis in camelids.128\n",

Prepatent disease is more common in the parasites with longer life cycles, that is, the helminths and E. macusaniensis. Prepatent and shedding periods for the most important camelid GI parasites are listed in Table 40-1\n. With E. macusaniensis, clinical disease and death may occur up to 2 weeks before the appearance of oocysts in feces.81 In the case of helminths, the gap may be several weeks as well, or even longer for Capillaria and Trichuris. For small coccidia, Cryptosporidum, and Giardia, clinical disease usually appears around the same time as passage of fecal cysts but may precede it by a day or two. If prepatent disease is suspected, serial fecal analyses at 2- to 4-day intervals may be used to confirm the organism; presumptive treatments may be instituted in the interim. When looking for prepatent or peripatent shedding of protozoan parasites, it is important to keep the shedding curve in mind; Eimeria oocyst passage resembles a bell-shaped curve, with few at the earliest stages, peaking in 1 to 2 weeks before tapering off. The same is true for Giardia and Cryptosporidium except that shedding may occur in multiple waves. Shedding curves are less of an issue with helminths, whose adults are relatively long-lived.",

The moniker \u201cmodified\u201d has been taken to the extreme in some instances, where the \u201cmodified\u201d versions of some tests bear little resemblance to their previous versions. The preferred test depends to some degree on the parasite we wish to detect, and unfortunately, no one test optimally detects all parasites.136 Many tests completely miss certain parasites.1.\nDirect smear. This is a simple test, in which a small amount of feces is liquefied with a small amount of saline solution and smeared onto a microscope slide. Only categoric quantification is possible. This is best for detecting motile protozoa such as Giardia and Balantidium trophozoites and adequate for most types of worm ova at high concentrations.129 It is not particularly effective for detecting parasites when only low numbers of ova or oocysts are present.2.\nSaturated saline flotation. This test relies on the difference in SG between saturated (1.18) or more dilute saline and the oocysts or ova. About 2 to 5 g of feces are dissolved in 10 mL of flotation solution in a 15 mL tube. The tube is filled with more solution to form a positive meniscus and a cover slip placed across the top. After 15 to 60 minutes, the coverslip is removed, placed on a slide, and examined under light microscopy. Saline will not float Trichuris, E. macusaniensis, or liver fluke eggs. Many other salts such as 33% ZnSO4 solution have a similar SG to saline. Saline distorts Giardia rapidly but may be the preferred flotation solution for Nematodirus and small Eimeria.3.\nSucrose flotation. This test is similar to the one above. Sheather solution (454 g of sucrose in 355 mL of hot water plus 6 mL of formalin [optional] to prevent microbial growth) has a higher SG than saline (1.27) and thus will float all but liver fluke eggs. The high viscosity of this solution may inhibit flotation of small coccidia or Nematodirus but may be better than saline for Cryptosporidium and Giardia.4.\nMcMaster counting chamber. Rather than floating the eggs in a tube onto a coverslip, this test involves putting a slurry into a counting chamber. A 4-g fecal sample is liquefied in 26 mL of saturated saline or sucrose solution by using a mortar and pestle. The suspension is funneled through a screen into a 50-mL tube. The filtrate is then used to fill two chambers of a counting slide, which is examined under light microscopy. Multiplying the number of eggs of each type by 25 yields an approximation of eggs per gram of feces. Most parasites can be seen this way, but this test is not particularly sensitive for detecting low levels of infection. The denser parasite eggs sink very quickly in saline and will be missed if any delay occurs before counting.5.\nDouble centrifuge technique. A 2-g fecal sample is liquefied in 98 mL of water by using a mortar and pestle or a similar system. The sample is allowed to dissolve completely, preferably overnight, and then the sample is stirred to create a homogeneous solution. Ten milliliters of the sample is poured into a graduated centrifuge tube and spun at 200\u00d7 gravity for 5 minutes. The supernatant is removed and a few milliliters of sugar solution (as above) added to resuspend the pellet. The tube is refilled with 10 to 12 mL of the sugar solution and then centrifuged again at 200\u00d7 gravity for 5 minutes. The tube is filled until a positive meniscus forms, and a coverslip is placed on top. After a suitable time, the coverslip is removed and placed on a glass slide for counting. For most parasites, peak ova or oocysts concentrations are found 4 to 6 hours later, but most positive samples will have been revealed within 1 hour. Multiplying the counts of all of each type of ovum or oocyst seen by 5 yields an approximation of ova or oocysts per gram of feces. The advantages of this technique are that the longer dissolving period enables more eggs to be released from fecal matter and the pelleting concentrates the eggs. This technique appears to be the best way to find small numbers of eggs, as with Nematodirus, Capillaria or many parasites at the onset of their shedding period.6.\nSedimentation. Feces are dissolved in water and either left to settle or pelleted in a centrifuge. A drop or two of the sediment is placed on a slide for microscopic examination. This is the most used technique for detecting fluke eggs, which do not float in most solutions. The Flukefinder is a specialized system for sedimenting fluke eggs. Sedimentation is also useful for detecting Balantidium coli.129\n7.\nBaermann test. This test is most commonly done on fresh feces to identify lungworms but may also be used for detecting Strongyloides. If the sample is allowed to sit for a few days, strongyle larvae may hatch out of their eggs and confound the diagnosis. This test involves suspending a fecal sample in cheesecloth within a funnel or a cone-shaped vessel. The vessel is filled with warm water and left to sit for at least 8 hours. Free-living larvae will concentrate at the bottom of the cone and can be pipetted out for examination under a microscope.8.\nImmunologic methods. Fluorescent antibody and enzyme immunosorbent tests are available to aid in the detection of Cryptosporidium and Giardia. A systemic (blood) antibody response to the flukes occurs within about 30 days of exposure and may be useful in detecting prepatent disease.9.\nPCR. Fecal PCR has gained acceptance as an accurate method of detecting cryptosporidiosis. It is less reliable for other coccidial diseases because of the durability of their thick-walled cysts. Nevertheless, preliminary reports suggest fecal PCR may have some value in detecting coccidiosis both in the prepatent and patent stages of infection.\n",

If history, signs, and the diagnostic evaluation support a diagnosis of endoparasitism, it should be considered regardless of egg count. By the same token, finding a few ova or oocysts in clinically healthy animals rarely reflects an emergency situation. Ambient conditions are also important in judging \u201cnormal\u201d shedding. Most worms and small coccidia follow the general pattern described for other herbivores, that is, older camelids are generally resistant to disease. Therefore, higher oocysts counts should be expected in camelids less than 1 year of age, and up to a few hundred coccidial oocysts per gram can be considered normal. Counts much higher than 200 oocysts per gram are unusual in adults unless the camelid is otherwise debilitated or in an overcrowded environment. Ova counts are similar, with the same caveats, as well as the considerations that certain parasites (Nematodirus battus, Capillaria, Lamanema) may shed few eggs and that many are also associated with prepatent or peripatent disease. With Giardia, the more cysts found in feces, the more likely it is that Giardia is the cause of diarrhea. Shedding may by episodic, corresponding to waves of replication.",

The perceived rarity may have been more a reflection of management (fewer large farms and infrequent births) than existence of pathogens. Large farms are now more common, as are neonatal problems. Earlier reports focused mainly on protozoal and helminth causes of diarrhea. This occurred partially because of (1) the ease of diagnosis of these problems with a light microscope; and (2) the lack of suitable techniques for diagnosing viral diseases. Bacterial disorders with multisystemic signs, for example, coliform sepsis and clostridial enterotoxemia, also received a fair amount of attention. These are certainly important disorders that occur under certain conditions but result in clinical pictures that are very different from typical uncomplicated neonatal or juvenile diarrhea in other domestic farm animals. Because of the emphasis on bacteria and systemic diseases, treatment recommendations usually emphasize antimicrobial drugs. Without contrary recommendations or data, these practices have continued.",

Other sporadic conditions include sepsis, peritonitis, or noninfectious ulcerative disorders. These may become commonplace in herds living in conditions of poor hygiene or with a high prevalence of failure of passive transfer.

Peritonitis leads to irritation and inflammation of the gut wall, affecting gut function, and often resulting in diarrhea. It also affects the transit of fluid and protein through the peritoneal space, affecting the gut's ability to transport fluid out of ingesta and into circulation. The four major causes of bacterial peritonitis that we see are (1) translocation of bacteria through a damaged gut or urogenital viscus wall, (2) direct introduction of bacteria through a wound or penetrating instrument, (3) release of bacteria through a ruptured gut, uterus, or urinary structure, and (4) hematogenous infection of the peritoneal cavity. Wounds are less common than the other three causes, which often are difficult to distinguish; by the time the animal's abdomen is examined before or after death and is found to have peritoneal exudate, reddened and thickened gut walls, and a spot of leakage or rupture, it is impossible to say which lesion led to the other two. The most common organisms isolated from abdominal fluid of camelids are Streptococcus and Escherichia. Streptococcus infection is usually hematogenous, and hence the primary pathogen, whereas Escherichia may come from a variety of sources. Specifically, streptococcal peritonitis is part of the \u201calpaca fever\u201d complex, a cause of fever, diarrhea, colic, and respiratory disease covered in Chapter 37.

Foremost, it should be clarified whether diarrhea is the primary problem or part of a larger syndrome. Camelids with primary diarrhea tend to have more profuse, watery feces and less evidence of systemic disease. Signs of systemic disease that suggest more than simple enteritis include fever; injected mucous membranes; other GI signs such as colic (peritonitis, slaframine or arsenic intoxication), vomiting (poisonous plant ingestion), abdominal distension (may reflect enteritis with protein loss or problems with the hepatic or urogenital systems); or dyspnea (streptococcal pleuritis in addition to peritonitis, or sepsis in general). Laboratory evidence of more complex disease includes neutropenia or a degenerative left shift, hyperfibronogenemia, high hepatocellular liver enzyme activities, and abnormalities (high cell count, protein concentration, or both; presence of microbes) of peritoneal fluid.",

Otherwise, the nature of profuse diarrhea depends more on the diet than on the agent. The more profuse and watery the diarrhea, the more commonly it leads to electrolyte and acid\u2013base disturbances. Hypochloremia, hyponatremia, and metabolic acidosis are reasonably common findings with viral enteritis and may be severe. With protozoal enteritis, these abnormalities are less common or severe but still may be present, especially in neonates. Because electrolyte loss is relatively rare with camelid illness, in general, these findings, even if mild, point strongly to an enteric disorder. With more severe dehydration or shock, lactic acidosis and azotemia develop. With any sick camelid, hyperglycemia is common; urinary loss of excess glucose may exacerbate dehydration, especially if water intake is inadequate. Water loss may, therefore, outstrip electrolyte loss, leading to more severe evidence of dehydration (tachycardia, obtundation, weakness, feed refusal) than would be expected in a ruminant with diarrhea and a similar degree of hyponatremia and hypochloremia. Thus, physical evidence may trump laboratory evidence regarding the severity of the disorder and need for aggressive treatment.",

Diagnostic assays available for use in other species have not been validated for camelids, and most are actually designed for human group A rotaviruses, the same group that causes most enteric infections in calves and foals.150 Nonetheless, several studies have found these tests to be useful for veterinary applications.151, 152, 153, 154 A rapid enzyme immunoassay test (ImmunoCard STAT! Rotavirus, Meridian Bioscience Inc., Cincinatti, USA) is available and has been recommended for use in cattle.155 Rapid latex agglutination test kits are also available (Rotavirus Latex Agglutination Test, Oxoid, UK, and Virogen Rotatest Test, Inverness Medical Professional Diagnostics, Princeton, NJ, USA). The Virogen Rotatest kits have been shown to have good sensitivity compared with virus isolation (87.8%) while specificity was 73.3%.151 The rapid tests are quick and easy to use, but it must be stressed that they have not been validated on camelid fecal samples. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) testing for rotavirus can also be performed on feces and is not bovine specific, so it may have an application in camelid neonatal diarrhea. Testing for coronavirus in cattle is achieved by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for fecal antigen, available in Europe: again, it is not known whether this test is sensitive for camelid coronavirus but strains isolated from alpacas suggest that they are closely related to some bovine strains.149 PCR techniques may also be used.156 Further research into the most appropriate diagnostic testing methodologies for viral pathogens in camelids is required.

Common clinical signs include weight loss, lethargy, depression, anorexia, or mild colic and often are noted for up to a month before death. Abdominal distension with ascites or respiratory difficulty with hydrothorax also are common; although diarrhea is less common with neoplastic disorders than with inflammatory or hypertrophic bowel disease, melena has been seen with squamous cell carcinoma. Diarrhea often is present when ascites becomes severe. In one camelid, antemortem diagnosis of neoplasia was made by microscopic examination of the peritoneal fluid, although most fluid samples from camelids with neoplasms are normal. In all camelids, the definitive diagnosis was made on the basis of postmortem examination. The primary tumor mass in most camelids was found in the cranial compartment of C1 (see Figure 40-31), with metastases throughout the abdominal and pleural cavities. Other sites, including the squamous C1-C2 junction and the gastric region of C3, have been reported. The tumor in this last llama was unusual because it occurred in a young animal and arose from a site not normally lined with squamous epithelium. Because of the tumor's location, an endoscope could be used to examine and biopsy the mass, but we are unaware of any attempt to do this. Reports on ruminal squamous cell carcinoma in cattle suggest a toxic etiology, particularly bracken fern toxicosis. We have not seen a sufficient number of camelids with this disease to make a similar inference, but bracken fern toxicosis has been associated with squamous cell carcinoma of the urinary tract in camelids. Attempts to identify a causative virus have been unrewarding. Because of the difficulty in making an antemortem diagnosis of this disease, no reports of treatment of these tumors have been published.",

As environmental survival is limited, soil contamination is unlikely to be the source of infection for camelids on pasture unless ruminants have recently grazed on it. The prevalence of chronic shedder or carrier camelids also appears to be low, although more sensitive diagnostic techniques may reveal more subclinical shedders.164 Therefore, contact with an actively shedding ruminant or contaminated ruminant product appears to be the most likely source of infections in camelids. Of ruminant products, goat or cow colostrum is the most widely used in camelids and also is likely to be ingested by the most susceptible host, the neonate.

Blood abnormalities include severe hypoalbuminemia; with obstruction, hypochloremia, metabolic alkalosis, and azotemia develop. The most severe lesions are in the adoral sections of the small intestine, which is different from the predilection for ileal hypertrophy in horses with this disorder.174 The cranial distribution makes palpation per rectum challenging, but the thickened loops and possibly gastric wall may be detected with ultrasonography. Exploratory laparotomy may be performed to obtain a biopsy sample, diagnose the cause of the chronic weight loss and diarrhea, and potentially relieve the obstruction. Grossly, the thickening differs from IBD or Johne disease in that the affected intestine does not have thickened rugose mucosal folds.

Occasionally, large trichobezoars, or loose aggregates of hair, are found, usually in the first compartment, but these are more likely to cause mucosal irritation, inappetence, and possibly gastric distention, rather than obstruction and colic (Figure 40-49\n).",

The typical camelid with small intestinal obstruction is mildly painful, has abdominal distension, is dehydrated, and has hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis with a high gastric fluid chloride concentration. Because of the mild signs, camelids with this type of lesion often are not noted to be sick for several days and often develop mucosal injury and inflammatory complications before detection. Thus, camelids with small intestinal obstruction have historically done poorly. Camelids with cecocolic obstruction have overt signs of colic, minimal dehydration and metabolic disturbances, and lesions that are easily detectable by rectal palpation or ultrasonography. Because of more timely detection and treatment and less tissue and metabolic compromise, camelids with cecocolic obstruction have a better prognosis. Camelids with entrapments and strangulations generally act like camelids with intraluminal obstruction of the same site except that camelids with strangulating lesions deteriorate more quickly without appropriate treatment. Hyperlactemia and high lactate content in serosanguinous abdominal fluid are characteristics of strangulation. Camelids with inflammatory lesions tend to have overt colic signs, but these may be overshadowed by depression. They tend to have abnormal CBC, blood protein and electrolyte concentrations, and peritoneal fluid but have other clinical features which overlap with those seen with obstructive lesions. Prognosis with inflammatory lesions is variable; most camelids have a poor prognosis, but those with some specific diseases (pancreatitis, E. macusaniensis enteritis, streptococcal peritonitis, mild bowel inflammation) may do well.",

Therefore, it is not recommended unless the lesion is thought to affect those compartments. The choice between ventral midline and right paralumbar exploratory laparotomy often is based on the preference of the surgeon, as both approaches allow for palpation, visualization, and exteriorization of most abdominal viscera, including the spiral colon, cecum, most of the small intestine, and the pyloric antrum of the third gastric compartment. The pyloric antrum may be difficult to exteriorize through a ventral midline incision when the third gastric compartment is distended with fluid. Therefore, a right paracostal or paralumbar incision may be preferable when a gastric or duodenal lesion is suspected.36, 44 Herniation of GI viscera through the body wall incision may occur after ventral midline laparotomy, although we have noted this to occur more frequently after cesarean section in large female llamas than after general surgical exploration of the abdomen of camelids.",

If not noted, the cria may become clinically ill or develop abdominal distension. Techniques to correct atresia ani in camelids are similar to those used in other species (Figure 40-59\n). As with neonatal ruminants, although surgical correction usually is fairly simple, camelids with atresia ani often have other developmental abnormalities. Specifically, we have seen atresia jejuni, horseshoe kidneys, renal agenesis, pelvic abnormalities, and skull malformation in conjunction with atresia ani. Thus, in spite of the ease of repair of the one problem, a good prognosis cannot be given until other malformations are ruled out.",

Although crias with these disorders do not pass meconium, they do have an anus, so the lesion is not readily apparent on inspection of the newborn. Atresia jejuni is the most serious segmental disorder because less healthy gut surface is available for nutrient and colostral absorption. This makes the neonate highly susceptible to hypoglycemia and infectious disease. Crias with intestinal atresia are usually bright at birth but develop progressive depression and abdominal distension over the first few days of life. Colic and tenesmus may be seen with atresia coli. No reports of surgical correction of intestinal atresia in camelids have been published, but it is likely that procedures developed for ruminants would be adequate. We have seen a cria with atresia jejuni at two separate sites, so the entire bowel should be examined before surgical correction is performed. Broad-spectrum antimicrobial drugs, IV fluids, and plasma are often required before and after surgery. Although a genetic basis for atresia coli and ani exist in other species, we do not have enough data to assess the genetic basis of these abnormalities in camelids.
