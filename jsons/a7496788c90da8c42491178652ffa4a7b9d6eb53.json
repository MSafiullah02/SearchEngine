Iraqi outdated public healthcare settings are already overwhelmed with many acute injuries from ongoing unrest. Iraq faces six challenges in controlling COVID-19 [1] : A shortage in number of quarantine facilities [2] , the availability of the testing which is limited to one governmental lab only in Baghdad [3] , a shortage in personal protective equipment (PPE) and ambulances [4] , a low level of public awareness [5] , a shortage in hygiene preparations and [6] a high rate of antibiotic resistance in case of secondary bacterial infection. Thus, Iraq alone cannot control such a rapidly emerging outbreak and needs help from the international community and the World Health Organization (WHO) to prepare additional medical labs, establish high standard quarantine facilities and provide medical equipment for healthcare professionals. On its side, Iraq needs to impose more restrictions on travel from countries with a COVID-19 outbreak as other countries have done.",

The first case of COVID-19 in Iraq was detected on Feb 24, 2020 in Al-Najaf city, south of Baghdad. By the end of March 13, 2020, the Iraqi Ministry of Health (MOH) announced that 101 confirmed cases of COVID-19 [2] and nine deaths had been recorded in 14 out of 18 Iraqi governorates. Baghdad, the capital of Iraq, reported the largest share (about 40%) of cases. This may indicate a rapid spreading of COVID-19 across Iraq. Thousands of Iraqis visited Iran during the current spring break which made them vulnerable to COVID-19. Unfortunately, returning Iraqis brought the infection through their cities when they came back home because there is no obligatory quarantine for those thousands of potentially infected people. This challenge raises an important question; is Iraq well prepared to control such a vicious viral infection? The simple answer is probably not without international support since huge organized efforts and resources (which Iraq does not have) are needed to treat infected people and prevent the spread of the outbreak.",

Iraqis may face many challenges in this regard. Firstly, the Iraqi MOH may not have the infrastructure to deal with this outbreak since public (government) healthcare settings are already overwhelmed dealing with many injured people from the ongoing unrest since October 1st, 2019. Moreover, public hospitals have low bed capacity and there is an unequal distribution of hospitals across the different governorates and between rural and urban populations [4] . This means that the Iraqi public healthcare sector has a shortage in the number of quarantine facilities. The current official policy is self-quarantine of thousands of Iraqi travelers returning from Iran in their homes since there are not enough quarantine facilities that can accommodate such a large number of people. Currently, Iraqi airports and borders have a healthcare team that checks the body temperature of returning travelers. However, these policies seem ineffective in preventing COVID-19 cases from entering the country. Hence, there is a necessity to establish a larger number of quarantine facilities for people coming from countries affected by the COVID-19 epidemic such as Iran which is the outbreak focus in the Middle East currently. By the end of March 13, 2020, Iran has the third highest number of confirmed cases (11,364) of COVID-19 with third highest number of deaths (514) due to the viral infection in the world (after China and Italy) [2] . In addition, more rigorous strategies are required to stop people with potential COVID-19 infection entering including closure the borders and stop travelling from and to Iran.",

Thus, other provinces need to send specimens from suspected cases to Baghdad to confirm an infection which may take up to 24 h. In this regard, primary healthcare settings, especially in rural areas, lack specialized personnel and equipment to obtain and handle such hazardous specimens [5] . Therefore, they refer all suspected cases to large teaching hospitals that are mainly found in Baghdad [4] . Unfortunately, there is no specific protocol for referral of potential cases, and the patient is not obliged to visit specialized centers. This may increase the chance of undiagnosed COVID-19 cases. In addition, there is a limited number of ambulances equipped with trained staff and required personal protective equipment (PPE) available to transfer potential infected patients from home to hospital. Thus, if a person with suspected symptoms of COVID-19 decides to visit a specialized hospital, there is a high risk of transmitting the infection to other people during the journey to hospital. This problem could be addressed by training practitioners in primary healthcare settings to collect and send specimen to the Central lab in Baghdad, while quarantining potential cases in isolated rooms. Moreover, more equipped ambulances are needed to transfer potential cases rather than using public or private modes of transportation.",

Unfortunately, the inadequate quantity of PPE is another (third) challenge which may impact both public (governmental hospitals) and private (clinics and community pharmacies) healthcare settings [6] . This PPE shortage has forced healthcare professionals to purchase PPE from the private market; such an increase in demand and shortage of supply of PPE are causing a rapid increase in costs.
