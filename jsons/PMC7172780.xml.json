To protect the mucosa from the gastric juice, both specialized gastric and intestine cells secrete mucus forming a gel-like layer of about 200 nm.

The molecular bases of their narrow and specific tropism for GI, unique among the Ads, are still not understood. In contrast to enteroviruses or hepatitis A producing systemic illness, these enteric Ads, similarly to rotaviruses or coronaviruses, do not cause disease outside GI, which may be related to the efficient host immune response. They can be isolated in the infectious state from the stools of infected children (Gary et al., 1979), with approximately 1011 physical virus particles/g of stool, which again shows their survival in the human digestive tract de Jong et al., 1983, Uhnoo et al., 1984.",

The trimeric hexons form 20 facettes of viral icosahedron which is sealed at each of the 12 vertices by a complex of the pentameric penton base and an outward extending trimeric fiber. These proteins are multifunctional. In addition to its structural role, the fiber protein is involved in virus attachment through binding primary cell receptor. The penton base protein is responsible for virus cell entry through binding to cellular \u03b1v integrins (Wickham et al., 1993) and viral release from endosomes on the pathway towards the cell nucleus (Greber et al., 1993). Recently, we have shown that the hexon of respiratory Ad promotes virus entry independently of CAR (primary) and integrin (secondary) receptors through interaction with phospholipids (Balakireva et al., 2002). This might explain the ability of the respiratory Ad2 to cross the physical barrier composed of lipid surfactant before infecting alveolar epithelium.",

While the majority of human Ad serotypes have only one kind of fiber, the enteric serotypes 40 and 41 possess two different fibers Kidd et al., 1993, Pieniazek et al., 1990, Yeh et al., 1994 present in the virion in equal ratio (Favier et al., 2002). Similar to fibers of respiratory Ads, the Ad40/41 long fiber interacts with CAR. However, CAR is not recognized by the short fiber (Roelvink et al., 1998). The narrow tropism of enteric Ads cannot result alone from Ad40/41 long fiber interaction with CAR. CAR mRNA is preferentially expressed in the heart, testis, prostate, and pancreas, which are not tissues targeted by enteric Ads infection. Moreover, the internalization of the majority of Ad serotypes is due to their interaction with integrins \u03b1v\u03b23 and \u03b1v\u03b25 via an RGD motif present in the virus penton base protein Bai et al., 1994, Mathias et al., 1994, Wickham et al., 1993. However, Ad40 and Ad41 lack the RGD motif in their penton bases or fibers (Albinsson and Kidd, 1999). Altogether, these data imply that the entry of enteric Ads is clearly different from that of respiratory serotypes.",

The short fiber might be involved in virus multiplication through interaction with cellular protein partners (Chroboczek et al., 2003) downstream of virus initial interaction with the cell plasma membrane. In this study, we analyzed the physicochemical properties of Ad41 by distinguishing it from the respiratory serotypes. It is reasonable to assume that the tropism of Ad41 is defined by a combination of features permitting to survive in the stomach and to pass through the mucus layer followed by the recognition of specific cellular plasma membrane partners leading to the successful infection of cells lining the GI.",

Using the primary sequences available in the databases, we found that Ad40/41 fibers have very basic predicted pI values in contrast to the predicted acidic values of structural proteins of the majority of human adenoviruses. In particular, the difference of more than 3 pH units between the enteric Ad41 short fiber and fibers of respiratory viruses Ad2 and Ad3 is very striking. Ad37 and Ad8 also display a high pI of the fiber and surprisingly high pI of the Ad37 penton base. The differences in charge of head domains of fibers of different serotypes are illustrated by the clusters of basic amino acids shown in the atomic or modeled structures of head domains of fibers of different serotypes (in blue in Fig. 1\n).",

It is thus reasonable to assume that the charge difference of some Ad proteins is reflected in the charge of the whole virus particle. Indeed, the particle migration varied when the mobility of different Ad serotypes is compared on native gel (Fig. 2)\n. While serotypes 2, 3, and 5 migrate towards the anode, Ad41 remained in the wells. The quality of virus preparations was checked by EM, and no aggregation has been noticed (results not shown). Acid treatment did not seem to affect virus mobility (compare a with b in Fig. 2), suggesting that virions were not disassembled. Under non-denaturing conditions, the mobility on native gel depends on the size, the shape (form), and the charge of the migrating entity. The organization and form of Ad virions are quite similar, and the serotypes differ only slightly in their DNA content; for example, Ad2 DNA contains 35 937 bases (Roberts et al., 1984) whereas Ad40 DNA contains 34 214 bases (Davison et al., 1993). It seems therefore that the observed mobility differences stem mainly from the charge difference of the viral proteins and in the case of Ad41 can be attributed to somewhat more basic penton bases, hexons, and significantly more basic fibers (Table 1).",

Using pH of the normal fasting human stomach, we compared the survival of infectious Ads during exposure to acid. We used 293 cells as they are permissive for both Ad41 and Ad2 and conventionally used for Ad41 production. To establish the experimental conditions for the infectivity assessment, at the beginning we obtained a curve of infection using increasing virus quantities for the same amounts of attached cells as described by Favier et al. (2002). From this we estimated the virus amount giving the maximum (saturation) of infection as well as giving 50% of maximum infection. For each virus infection, two sets of condition were used, 50% and nearly 100% of infectivity saturation, and progeny production was measured after viral inoculum has been exposed to buffered HCl. Preliminary time course experiment demonstrated that for Ad2 the largest drop in infectivity occurred after 5 min of acid treatment (results not shown). Therefore, similar to studies on rotavirus acid stability (Weiss and Clark, 1985), short pH exposure was performed. Such exposure, in contrast with long dialysis at pH 6.4\u20136.8 Pereira and Wrigley, 1974, van Oostrum and Burnett, 1985, does not result in Ad vertex removal. Because acid secretion by gastric parietal cells reduces the intraluminal pH to about 2.0 in adults and to about 4.0 in children (Gryboski and Walker, 1983), both conditions were employed (Fig. 3)\n. The scatter of results is typical for this kind of experiments; therefore, 33 experiments have been carried out after acid exposure. In about half of the experiments, the Ad41 infectivity was not affected by acid exposure compared to virus diluted in culture medium. Interestingly, in 17 cases out of 33, the infectivity of Ad41 increased. However, at the same time the infectivity of Ad2 was inhibited by acid exposure, with a negligible activation observed in three cases out of 33. On average, the Ad41 infectivity was unchanged, whereas Ad2 infectivity decreased by 20%. No notable difference was observed for pH 2 versus pH 4 or at room temperature (RT) versus 37 \u00b0C, in contrast with the results obtained for another enteric virus, rotavirus. For this virus, acid resistance was significantly higher at pH 4 than at pH 2 and at RT than at 37 \u00b0C (Weiss and Clark, 1985). These experiments show the remarkable stability of enteric Ad under pH conditions of the human fasting stomach.",

As this protein mediates the initial virus attachment to infected cells, it was of interest to analyze its behavior after acid exposure. Because contrary to respiratory serotypes Ad2 and Ad5, Ad41 (as well as Ad3) fibers cannot be purified from Ad41-infected cells without the penton base (see Favier et al., 2002), therefore Ad41 penton, complex of fiber, and penton base had to be used in these experiments. In the first experiment, the fiber interactions with the primary receptor CAR were compared before or after acid exposure (Fig. 4)\n. The extracellular domain of CAR was tested to interact with Ad41 short and long fibers contained in pentons (SP41 and LP41), with Ad5 fiber (F5), and with Ad3 fiber contained in Ad3 penton dodecahedra, symmetrical assemblies of 12 Ad3 pentons (P3) (Fender et al., 1997). In agreement with the data of Roelvink et al. (1998), neither Ad3 nor short Ad41 fibers did recognize CAR, whereas both Ad5 and long Ad41 fibers interacted with the receptor. These results were also found after acid exposure, showing that this treatment does not trigger any major structural change of the fiber protein, which would abolish CAR interaction.",

Because the trimeric and well-folded fiber protein is largely resistant to chymotrypsin (it is cut at a unique N-terminal location only, at the elevated amount of enzyme, Devaux et al., 1987), we used this enzyme to probe fiber protein stability. Native fibers and pentons were purified from cells infected with wild-type viruses. Because we had to use the pentons for Ad41 (see explanation above), the penton was also used for Ad5 (P5). The fibers were revealed with antibody. Initial proper folding of fibers was verified by the presence of the trimeric forms. Under denaturing conditions, Ad5 and long Ad41 fiber monomers run according to their molecular masses of about 62 000 for Ad5 and long Ad41 fibers and about 42 000 for short Ad41 fiber (Fig. 5\n, lanes 1). Under non-denaturing conditions, the trimeric long fibers with molecular masses of about 180 000 run above the 175-kDa marker and the trimeric Ad41 short fiber (molecular mass of about 130 000) runs between 82- and 175-kDa markers (Fig. 5, lanes 2). As in the previous experiment, exposure to acid alone did not significantly affect the fiber trimers (lanes 3). Purified Ad5 fiber (F5) was destroyed by the combined action of acid exposure and chymotrypsin (Fig. 5C, lane 5 for F5). Contrary to that, chymotrypsin after prior acid treatment did not result in proteolysis of the Ad41 fibers (Figs. 5A and B, lanes 5). Altogether, these results show that acid exposure followed by pH jump to 7.5 results in such subtle changes in the Ad5 fiber structure that it can still interact with CAR (Fig. 4). However, these changes are sufficient to permit ensuing proteolysis of the respiratory serotype 5 fiber (Fig. 5). On the contrary, both fibers of enteric Ad survive well acid exposure, pH jump to 7.5 and the proteolytic treatment, showing the unusual stability under GI simulating conditions encountered by enteric viruses.",

Mucosa cells of the stomach contain lamellar bodies that function as lipid storage and secretory organelles, permitting synthesis, excretion, and turnover of the gastric surfactant. Phospholipids exert the greatest impact on the physicochemical properties of gastric mucus. It was found initially that the major phospholipid of the lamellar bodies of the mucosa cells in the stomach is dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine (DPPC) (Schmitz and Muller, 1991). It was also thought that this phospholipid would also be predominant in the mucus (gastric surfactant) (Lichtenberger, 1995). However, recent data show that both gastric mucosa and mucus contain significant amounts of unsaturated PC together with phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) Bernhard et al., 1995, Larhed et al., 1998, Nardone et al., 1993.",

The assay was performed in the absence or presence of magnesium ions, following the conditions used for the investigation of lipid interaction with pleckstrin homology domains Dowler et al., 1999, Thomas et al., 2001, Thomas et al., 2002. PC, DPPC, PE, and dipalmitoyl phosphatidylglycerol (DPPG) were spotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane and incubated with Ad2 and Ad41 in comparable molar amounts. It should be noted that the assay sensitivity was ensured by the amount of the immobilized lipid being in the pmol range (Thomas et al., 2001). Before acid treatment, at both binding conditions used, Ad2 attached to DPPC, whereas Ad41 attached to DPPC only at pH 6, additionally attaching strongly to DPPG (Fig. 6)\n. To simulate the abrupt pH jump induced by the passage from stomach to intestine, both viruses were exposed to pH 2 for 1 min at 37 \u00b0C, then brought up to pH 7.5 and incubated with immobilized lipids. Contrary to the untreated Ad2 case, no lipid interaction was observed after Ad2 was exposed to a pH shock (Fig. 6). Most interestingly, pH shock of enteric Ad41 confirmed its interaction with DPPC and DPPG and improved its interaction with two other phospholipids. The loss of the lipid interaction by Ad2 can be explained by the changes in virus integrity induced by acid treatment, as it has been illustrated by the decrease in infectivity and in fiber stability Fig. 3, Fig. 5. In the case of Ad41, there is no loss of infectivity upon acid treatment, which would suggest the conservation of virion integrity. However, an increase in lipid interaction observed for Ad41 upon acid shock suggests in addition some capsid transformation improving its ability to recognize different classes of phospholipids.",

One class of such receptors is glycoshingolipids, a highly polymorphic class of lipids, which occur in mammalian cells expressed on the cell surface and are predominant in the gastric epithelium (reviewed in Hakomori, 1990). To understand the interaction of enteric Ad with the surface of mucosa cells, the analysis of Ad41's ability to interact with lipids was extended to sphingolipids. Membrane-immobilized sphingolipids were incubated with both viruses (Fig. 7)\n. Both Ad41 and Ad2 interacted with sulfatide; however, only Ad41 interacted specifically with four additional sphingolipids: sphingosine-1-phosphate, lysophosphatidic acid, mono-sialoganglioside GM1, and di-sialoganglioside GD3, suggesting much higher, possibly multivalent, Ad41 affinity for cell surface. These experiments together show the remarkable lipophilicity of enteric Ad, which most probably plays a role in virus ability to cross the protective mucus barrier and to attach to the surface of cells lining the GI.",

For this we examined the behavior of Ad41 virions by simulating in vitro four crucial steps leading to successful enteric infection: survival in acidic stomach environment, immunity to proteolytic attack after acid exposure, interaction with phospholipids present in the mucus barrier protecting the GI mucosa, and finally, attachment to the apical surface of GI lining cells.",

            "text": "Comparing the theoretical pI of different Ad capsid proteins, we observed that enteric hexon and penton base proteins are somewhat more basic and enteric fibers are significantly more basic than the appropriate proteins of respiratory serotypes (Table 1). The charge distribution on the head domain of fibers of different serotypes (Fig. 1) shows the presence of clusters of basic amino acids for the Ad41 fibers and the more positive global charge related to the higher pI of these head domains (Table 1) This positive surface potential is particularly pronounced for the Ad41 long fiber. Furthermore, Ad41 mobility observed during electrophoresis under native conditions indicated a much more basic charge of enteric virions than other Ad serotypes (Fig. 2). This feature immediately suggested that upon encountering stomach acidic conditions, the protonation of basic Ad41 particle would be much less damaging to the virion integrity than for the significantly less basic respiratory Ad2 or Ad5. Indeed, acid treatment significantly impaired Ad2 infectivity whereas Ad41 viability was not affected by the acid (Fig. 3). Because all mucosa possess an enzymatic barrier composed primarily of proteolytic enzymes (Zhou and Li Wan Po, 1994), we analyzed the proteolytic resistance of Ad41 fibers, viral proteins mediating cell attachment. Contrary to the fiber of the respiratory serotype, Ad41 fibers were not digested by chymotrypsin after acid exposure (Fig. 5). This tends to show that Ad41 survival in the acid stomach environment stems from the pronounced basic character of the enteric Ad particle, and in particular, from the remarkable stability of its fibers, which under acidic stomach conditions would likely retain, in the presence of proteolytic enzymes, the ability to attach to the host cells. Some viruses (e.g., rotaviruses) have evolved so that proteolytic processing facilitates viral infection. Our results strongly suggest that enteric adenoviruses use another adaptation mechanism, which is the prevalence of basic charge of the virions. It protects the virions against the negative effects of the protonation upon the low pH conditions encountered in the stomach and subsequently against the activity of proteolytic enzymes present in GI.",

One of the potentially important biophysical features of mucus relates to its \u201cunwettability\u201d linked with its hydrophobic character. The hydrophobic properties of mucus as well as its viscosity appear to depend on its lipid constituents and specifically on the presence of a phospholipid surfactant that is synthesized, stored, and secreted by GI mucus cells (reviewed in Lichtenberger, 1995). The mucus layer within the GI tract turns over continuously, and the so-called \u201csoluble mucus\u201d can be found within the GI lumen (Lehr et al., 1991). The phospholipid constituents of the mucus are mainly PC and PE, which together account for more than 60% of total phospholipid (Nardone et al., 1993). Interestingly, the protective effect of the mucosa against gastric juice, damaging agents, and microorganisms can be attributed to the unsaturated phospholipid, DPPC Lichtenberger, 1995, Schmitz and Muller, 1991.",

It was observed that the proteolytic cleavage, believed to occur in the lumen of intestine, enhances rotavirus infectivity in vitro (Estes et al., 1981). In addition, observations on membrane permeabilization by rotaviruses led to the hypothesis of a direct virus penetration across the plasma membrane lipid phase (Ruiz et al., 1994). However, not much is known about the virus behavior in the GI lumen as well as about the mechanism allowing the passage through protective mucus layer. To our knowledge, our data on enteric Ad41 are the first allowing the reasonable hypotheses concerning the chain of events starting from the oral route of virus entry, crossing mucus, and attaching to the surface of the epithelial monolayer lining the GI.",

The virulence of enteric Ads against human GI has been recognized as being of value for putative applications linked to gastric gene therapy (Croyle et al., 1998a). In addition, the eventual spread of these vectors would be easy to control because their infections are confined to epithelial cells adjacent to the intestinal lumen. However, because of the lack of the recombinant Ads constructed with the backbone of enteric serotypes, all GI gene therapy assays are done with respiratory Ad5-derived vectors (see for example Foreman et al., 1998). Alternatively, Ad5-derived vectors are used in vitro in combination with cyclodextrins, rendering positively charged formulations (Croyle et al., 1998b) or after manipulations allowing ablation of the native (respiratory) tropism (Heideman et al., 2002). In view of our data, it is clear that this kind of recombinant Ads will not survive oral applications in vivo. The construction of GI delivery vectors based on the enteric Ads backbone and further studies on the role of enteric Ads capsid proteins in virus entry will bring us closer to the intelligent use of our fundamental knowledge in human health applications.",

Lane 1, boiled fiber; lane 2, native fiber; lane 3, 1-min treatment with HCl, pH 2 at 37 \u00b0C; lane 4, fiber digested by chymotrypsin at pH 7.5 with ratio 1/5 enzyme/substrate; lane 5, fiber exposed to HCl for 1 min at pH 2 at 37 \u00b0C, neutralized, and digested by chymotrypsin at final pH 7.5 with ratio 1/5 enzyme/substrate. Fibers in pentons were revealed by Western blot with the appropriate antibody. Ad5 fiber was visualized by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue (F5, left side) or revealed by Western blot (F5, right side).",
