            "text": "Creutzfeld-Jakob disease (CJD) was described in 1920\u20131921. It is a rare, but absolutely fatal disease with a mean incidence of about 0.4 cases per 10 million population, usually hereditary but there is also a transmissible form e.g. during corneal transplantation or on application of hypophyseal growth hormone. A new variant of human CJD (abbreviated as \u201cvCJD\u201d) has been observed in Britain since 1994, differing from classic CJD by a substantially shorter incubation period (months rather than years), a much higher incidence rate (the original inter-annual increase of the incidence was 20\u201330%) and in also affecting young people. This vCJD was detected disproportionately more often in families of farmers in areas where BSE was endemic and after contact with diseased cattle. There is a justified hypothesis that vCJD is, in fact, BSE transmitted to humans, it means a zoonosis. This hypothesis has been promoted by results of several experiments with BSE on animals (monkeys and mice). The CNS, bone marrow, neural ganglions, ileum, retina, and so-called mechanically-recovered meat (remnants of meat detached from backbone and ribs, used for preparation of hamburgers, sausages and minced meat in tins for humans and pet animals) are regarded as risky bovine tissues for consumption. Until August 2010, \u201conly\u201d 212 people had died of vCJD (against the originally expected many hundreds or thousands of victims), out of which 43 patients were from outside Great Britain (France 25 cases, Ireland 6, the Netherlands 2, Spain 1, Portugal 1, Italy 2, Canada 1, USA 3, Japan 1, and Saudi Arabia 1). The epidemic was efficiently controlled by drastic veterinary measures: culling, and the ban on feeding meat-bone meal to cattle.",

Migratory birds can transport EEE virus.Animal disease: encephalomyelitis in horses (EEE, WEE, VEE), some other mammals, and in pheasants (EEE).Transmission mode (Figs. 8.1, 8.2): culicine mosquitoes, less other arthropods. Main cycles in nature: sylvatic (endemic) and urban (epidemic, synanthropic): WEE \u2013 Culex tarsalis and Ae. melanimon (but also Cx. pipiens, Cx. quinquefasciatus, Cx. restuans, Ae. dorsalis, Ae. nigromaculis, Culiseta inornata, An. freeborni as secondary or occasional vectors) + birds as vertebrate hosts (house sparrows in the urban epidemic cycle); Ae. melanimon acts as a bridge vector of WEE virus \u2192 horse and man; reptiles may also host the virus (virus overwintering in them is possible). In EEE, the main vector is Culiseta melanura (also Cx. salinarius, Ae. mitchellae, An. crucians, Cx. restuans as secondary vectors) + birds as vertebrate hosts; Ae. sollicitans, Ae. vexans, and Coquillettidia perturbans act as bridge vectors of EEE \u2192 man and horse. VEE (including the enzootic subtypes Mucambo, Tonate, Everglades, and Pixuna) is vectored by Ae. taeniorhynchus (primary vector), Psorophora columbiae, P. discolor, Culex spp., An. crucians, Coquillettidia perturbans, Mansonia titillans (Coquillettidia and Aedes spp. in epidemic cycle) + rodents. Congenital infections have also been described (foetal abnormalities, abortion).Human disease: EEE, WEE, VEE \u2013 fever (also chills, headache, body aches, lethargy, nausea, vomiting, prostration, inflammation of throat, cervical lymphadenitis, dizziness, encephalitis). The highest fatality rate has been observed in EEE (35\u201375%, against about 20% in WEE), and persistent sequelae (paralysis, pareses) are comparatively frequent, especially in children \u2013 some of them may remain mentally deficient. A total of 221 humans cases of EEE were confirmed in the USA in 1964\u20132005. South-American strains of EEE virus are obviously less virulent, only 2 fatal cases have been reported. WEE epidemics: 1941 USA (3,000 human cases); 1964\u20131997, USA a total 639 cases. A major outbreak of VEE occurred in Venezuela and Columbia in 1962\u20131964 when about 30,000 persons were ill and 300 of them died, a smaller one in Mexico and Texas in 1971 (84 cases), and a huge one in 1995 in Columbia and Venezuela with 75,000\u2013100,000 cases.Bio-containment: BSL-2 (WEE, EEE), BSL-3 (VEE: a high risk of laboratory infections).Prevention: there are mono-, bi- and tri-valent inactivated vaccines (horse, human), their use is however limited (usually applicable for laboratory personnel).Geographical distribution: North, Central and South America. However, only the less virulent subtypes of VEE occur in North America (Tonate, Everglades). Rio Negro and Pixuna viruses are other subtypes of VEE, occurring in Argentina and Brazil, respectively. Brand new data indicate that EEE virus strains that circulate in Central and South America might represent a distinct species compared to North American strains, needing a possible reclassification of EEE (J.

In the sylvatic cycle, man acquires infection accidentally during occupational (e.g., hunters) or recreational (tourism) activities. In Africa, an intermediate (savannah) cycle involves transmission of YF from tree hole-breeding Aedes spp. (e.g., Ae. opok, Ae. luteocephalus) to humans living or working in jungle border areas. For typical habitats of sylvatic YF, see Photos 5.1 and 5.2.Human disease: yellow fever \u2013 high fever with chills, headache, backache, vomiting (in severe cases black vomit containing blood), haemorrhages, necrotic hepatitis (YF virus reveals a marked hepatotropism) with icterus, nephritis, albuminuria, sometimes also encephalitis; fatality rate is 5\u201340%. YF was introduced in the Caribbean from western Africa during the slave trade (introduction of viraemic persons and infected Ae. aegypti mosquitoes on slave ships): the first extensive epidemic occurred here in 1647\u20131648 and involved Little Antilles (Barbados, St. Cristof, Guadeloupe), Yucatan and Cuba (in Havana one-third of citizens died); epidemics occurred frequently in Central America also in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. In 1741 and 1802\u20131803, big outbreaks of YF were reported in Portugal and Spain (80,000 victims \u2013 also an import on ships, with a consequent spread from seaports to inland); in 1793, 15% citizens of Philadelphia died on YF; in 1853, 8,000 persons from 29,000 infected died in New Orleans; 1900, Havana: Walter Reed Commission examined YF in Havana and evaluated the transmission mode of this disease; 1901, eradication of the Ae. aegypti vector of YF in Havana (Gorgas), later also in the Panama Canal area; since 1940 periodic epidemics have occurred in eastern Africa: 1940, Sudan 15,000 cases; 1951, Ethiopia 100,000 cases (30,000 people died); 1959, Sudan 1,800 cases; 1960\u20131962, Ethiopia 300,000 cases; 1965, Senegal 20,000 cases; 1969, Ethiopia 2,200 cases, and also a major epidemic in West Africa (Nigeria, Mali, Burkina Faso, Togo, Ghana); 1978 Gambia 8,400 cases (1,600 fatal); 1987, Nigeria 1,450 cases (565 fatal); 2000, Guinea 688 cases (225 fatal); 2005, Sudan 600 cases. 1998\u20132002, Brazil a total of 251 cases (96 fatal).

For a habitat, see Photo 5.6.Human disease: dengue, usually biphasic fever with an intense headache, myalgia, arthralgia, acute pain of eyes (retroorbital pressure), stiff neck, rash, nausea, insomnia; convalescence long (fatigue and depression for several weeks). Much more severe form of the disease is the dengue haemorrhagic\nfever (DHF), sometimes combined with syndrome of haemorrhagic shock (petechial bleeding into the skin and visceral organs) and fatality rate 5\u201320%. DHF manifests most frequently when infection with DEN-2 virus follows about 20 years after primoinfection with DEN-1 virus (demonstrated in Cuba). Infection with one dengue serotype results in a long-term immunity against reinfection with the same type, there is, however, no cross-protection among other serotypes (i.e., a person could experience four independent infection). Dengue is an important tropical pandemic, comparable to malaria. Epidemics: 1897\u20131902 Australia; 1927/1928 Greece (650,000 persons from 704,000 citizens in Athens and Piraeus became ill); 1931 Tchaiwan; 1943\u20131944 Pacific islands and New Guinea \u2013 a frequent disease of American soldiers (a major health problem during war operations); 1954 the Philippines; 1980\u20131987 South and Central America recorded 40,000\u2212390,000 cases annually (the Cuba alone reported >500,000 cases of DEN-1 in 1977, >400,000 cases of DEN-2 (DHF 10,000, 158 patients died on DHF shock) in 1981); and 5,208 cases of DEN-2 (DHF 205 cases, 12 patients succumbed) in 1997. Brazil reported 56,000 patients in 1994, 530,000 in 1998, and 290,000 in 2002 (all four dengue serotypes). In Argentina, dengue re-emerged in 1997, after the last epidemic in 1917. Dengue epidemics are less frequent in Africa, but the activity has increased also here: 1977 Seychelles; 1982 Kenya (DEN-2); 1985 Mozambique (DEN-3); 1982 and 1993 Somalia (DEN-2); 1994 Saudi Arabia (DEN-2). Epidemic occurrence of dengue is also known from India, Singapore, Malaysia and elsewhere in tropical countries of Asia and Oceania. 1998 south Vietnam 120,000 cases (including DHF), 342 of them fatal. According to WHO, dengue occurs in >100 tropical and subtropical countries at present, about 40% of the world population is at risk, and approximately 50 million people are infected annually, 300\u2013400 thousands have DHF and 22,000 die. Recent expansion of DEN-3 was reported in West Africa (Cape Verde Islands, 2009, more than 17,000 cases). According to WHO reports, about 160 per 100,000 tourists visiting endemic areas acquire dengue infection and export it worldwide annually.Bio-containment: BSL-2.Vaccine: not available at present.Geographical distribution: the whole tropical and subtropical belt \u2013 largely southeastern Asian region (original area), Africa, and Central and South America, less often Mexico and southern Texas (2004), and since the 1990s also northeastern Australia.\n",

Migratory birds and corvids contribute to the spread of WNV to distant areas. Rabbits and squirrels have been shown experimentally to develop viraemia titres capable of infecting biting mosquitoes.Animal disease: encephalomyelitis of equids with a high fatality rate, 25\u201330% (France, Italy, Morocco, USA etc.). Virulent strains of WNV (e.g. NY-99) cause systemic disease in free-living birds (corvids \u2013 Photo 7.81 \u2013 and some other passerines, birds of prey etc.) and domestic birds (goose) with a mass dying, and also alligators in Florida were severely affected during the US epizootic.Transmission mode (Fig. 8.6): largely by ornithophilic mosquitoes (Culex univittatus, Cx. pipiens, Cx. modestus, Cx. quinquefasciatus, Cx. salinarius, Cx. restuans, etc.), exceptionally ixodid (Hyalomma) and argasid (Argas) ticks. WNV cycles: (1) sylvatic (exoanthropic, natural foci) involving wild, mainly wetland and water birds as amplifying hosts of the virus and ornithophilic mosquitoes as vectors; (2) urban (synanthropic), with synanthropic and domestic birds as hosts and mosquito species feeding on both birds and mammals as vectors. Palaearctic natural foci of WNV infections are bound to wetland ecosystems, e.g. big river deltas (Volga, Danube, Rh\u00f4ne in Europe, or Djudj in west Africa). WNV transmission is also possible by blood transfusion, organ transplantation, or aerosol (laboratory infections). Contact and alimentary transmission between birds (raptors, corvids) has also been documented.Human disease: West Nile fever (West Nile encephalitis, West Nile disease) with a sudden onset of fever, pharyngitis, headaches, myalgia, arthralgia, fatigue, nausea, sometimes conjunctivitis, lymphadenitis, quite often maculopapulose rash on the trunk and extremities with erythema in face, encephalitis (in about 10% of patients, i.e. roughly 1% of all infected persons); fatality rate is 5\u201310% (most frequently succumb persons older than 60 years). Convalescence used to be long in adults, but longterm sequellae are rare. Epidemics: 1950\u20131957 hundreds of cases in Israel, especially among immigrants; 1974 a big outbreak in South Africa (about 3,000 sick persons); 1994 Algeria, human cases; 1996 >800 patients (50 died) in Romania \u2013 mainly in Bucharest and environs (in the consequent years 1997\u20132006 a total of only 90 cases with 6 fatalities); 1997 Tunisia, tens of human cases; 1997 south Moravia (Czechland) 5 cases; 1999 Volgograd, Astrakhan and Krasnodar regions 826 ill persons (40 died), and 2000\u20132006 here 316 additional patients; 1999\u20132000 Israel >430 cases (37 patients died); 1999 first introduction of WNV (Israeli strain) into USA \u2013 New York (62 ill persons, 7 of them died) while in subsequent years followed thousands of WNF cases in the USA (and several cases in Canada), and hundreds of patients succumbed (at the same time, thousands of horses and birds died as well); the virus spread rapidly across the continent \u2013 in 2002 it reached western coasts of North America being detected then in virtually all US states (Table 8.1). WNV has also occurred in Mexico, Central America including the Caribbean, and in 2006 as far southwards as in Argentina. 2003 France, 2 human cases. 2004 several patients in western Siberia. In 2008, several human neuroinvasive WN cases were reported from Italy (3), Hungary (12), and Romania (2). In 2009, 11 human cases of WNV encephalitis were recorded in Italy (Emilia-Romagna), and recently a WNF outbreak has occurred in northern Greece where 164 cases including 14 deaths have been reported as of September 6, 2010.Bio-containment: BSL-3.Prevention: There is a WNV vaccine for horses, but not yet a vaccine for humans.

LI virus causes disease in sheep and red grouse.Transmission mode (Fig. 8.9): by ixodid ticks (reservoir \u2013 TOT), especially Ixodes ricinus (CEE, LI), I. persulcatus (RSSE); alimentary (consumption of raw, thermally untreated milk and dairy products from goats and sheep: 1951 Ro\u017e\u0148ava, Slovakia: about 500 patients), aerogenic (laboratory infections).Circulation of TBE virus in a natural focus shows Fig. 8.9. About 0.5\u20133% of Ixodes ticks are usually infected in natural foci of TBE. For different natural foci of TBE (and LI), see Photos 5.7\u20135.13.Human disease: tick-borne encephalitis usually with typical biphasic course: the 1st phase starts with fever and flu-like symptoms (severe headache, myalgia, arthralgia), sometimes conjunctivitis; after a short interval of usually 4\u20137 days of an apparent recovery, the 2nd phase starts with affection of the CNS (meningoencephalitis) accompanied with photophobia, dizziness, pareses of cranial nerves and extremities, ataxia; fatality rate ranges from 1% (CEE, LI) to 20\u201330% (RSSE, FE); convalescence is long-term, and neurological sequellae (residua) sometimes including pareses are quite common. Subtypes of TBE viruses were isolated in Eurasia first in 1930 (LI), 1937 (RSSE) and 1948 (CEE). In some European countries, TBE morbidity is quite frequent: for instance, on average 368 (140\u2013744) cases of TBE was reported in Czechland (population about 10 million) annually in the two-decade period 1970\u20131999; In the year 2006 the TBE incidence in Czechland peaked at 1,026 patients. In 1999, an unusual epidemic of TBE (caused by a variant of FE subtype) occurred in the Novosibirsk area of Russia: out of 447 cases, 8 patients died with haemorrhagic syndrome. 1993\u20132000 were described first TBE human cases in Japan (caused by FE subtype).Bio-containment: for CEE, RSSE and FE subtypes BSL-4 (when the personnel is vaccinated, BSL-3 is enough). For other TBE virus subtypes: BSL-3.Diagnosis: serology (ELISA, HIT, CFT, VNT), detection of IgM in early phase or seroconversion in paired serum samples; less common is the isolation of the virus from the blood or CSF in cell cultures (e.g., PS pig embryo kidney cells) or in mice, detection of the virus\u2019 RNA by using RT-PCR.Prevention: inactivated vaccine (\u201cFSME-Immun\u201d Immuno/Baxter; \u201cEncepur\u201d Behring); specific immunoglobulins (but effective only when applied immediately, i.e. within 1\u20132 days after infection, otherwise it could be even detrimental); repellents against ticks.Geographical distribution: Eurasia (LI: UK and Norway, CEE: western and central Europe; RSSE: European and Asian Russia, Baltic countries, Finland; FEE: Far East Russia, northern China, Japan).\n\n",

The disease occurs usually in the late summer and early autumn when the vector mosquito density increases markedly. In the USA, the California group viruses are the most frequent cause of arboviral encephalitides (except for WN encephalitis since the year 2000). In the years 1963\u20131985, a total of 1,700 human cases of California encephalitis were reported from 23 states. During 2003\u20132007, a total of 355 patients (83% occurred in children <16 year old) were reported with probable and confirmed LACV infection in USA: 77% of them exhibited encephalitis or meningoencephalitis, 17% meningitis, and the rest were uncomplicated febrile cases; deaths occurred in 1.9% of confirmed cases, and in 8.6% of patients with encephalitis. In central and eastern Europe, many tens of cases of Valtice fever have been described since the 1970s, and a majority of people of the higher age groups living in, or close to, natural foci have antibodies to TAHV. However, many symptomatic cases of Valtice fever remain undiagnosed and characterized only as a (summer) status febrilis because there is no routine laboratory diagnosis of this disease in the region at present.

Occupational disease: cattle breeders, butchers, livestock industry, health professionals (nosocomial spread), specialized infectious laboratory workers (aerosol).Human disease: Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever with severe headache, neckache, back pains, myalgia, dizziness, stiffness, petechial rash on the trunk, conjunctivitis, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhoea, photophobia, lymphadenopathy, hepatomegaly, hepatitis, psychotic signs (depression, sleepiness, lassitude), bleeding from mucous membranes (nose, gums, gastrointestinal tract) and kidneys, sometimes bleeding into brain, liver failure, pulmonary failure, haemorrhagic shock. Increased levels of transaminases, leucopenia, thrombocytopenia and coagulopathy. Long convalescence. Fatality rate 5\u201330% (in nosocomial infections up to 50%). Epidemics: e.g. in Bulgaria 487 notified cases in 1954/1955; Kosovo 119 cases (13% fatal) during 1995\u20132001; 1997\u20132003 Bulgaria 138 cases (29 died); a total 1,568 cases were notified in Bulgaria from 1953 to 2008, with a mean fatality rate of 17%. Since 1999 (but especially in 2006\u20132007), a reactivation of natural foci and re-emergence of CCHF occurred in southern Russia (regions Stavropol, Astrakhan, Rostov, Volgograd, Kalmykia, Dagestan) \u2013 a total of >1,300 patients were diagnosed with CCHF until 2007, the fatality rate has been 3\u20135%. Albania reported 8 cases in 2001 and additional cases (an outbreak) occurred in Kosovo at the same time. A continuous epidemic process started in Turkey in 2002, and until 2009 a total of 4,430 cases were reported from 680 settlements mainly in the Tokat and Sivas provinces (but as many as 2,615 cases were notified solely in the last 2 years 2008 and 2009), with a mean overall fatality rate of 5%; in addition, 16% of healthy population have antibodies to CCHF virus in Turkey at present (most often farmers and village residents). This exceptional epidemiological upsurge of CCHF in Turkey (largely in the Asian part of the country) has been associated ecologically with fragmentation and use of agricultural land and the formation, by this way, of optimal habitats for Hyalomma marginatum vector ticks. Some epidemics outside Europe: 2000\u20132004 Iran 248 cases; 2003 Mauretania 38 cases (11 fatal). In 2009, cases of CCHF were also reported from southern Russia, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, Iran, and Pakistan. Several US soldiers acquired CCHF during field operations in Afghanistan.Bio-containment: BSL-4.Diagnosis: RT-PCR, detection of antibodies or antigen (ELISA, IFA), isolation of the virus (extreme risk).Treatment: in acute phase (if diagnosed very early) ribavirin, or hyperimmune serum (globulin).Prevention: a vaccine of Bulgarian provenience (inactivated, suckling mouse brains; not commercial, a small scale production).Geographical distribution: Africa, Arabian peninsula, Minor and central Asia, Iran, Pakistan, China (Xinjiang province), Albania, Kosovo, Bulgaria (Photo 5.17), Turkey, Greece, south Ukraine, south European Russia.\n\n",

The source of human rabies were in Europe in the 1980s: wild mammals 78.8% (of them fox 74.1%, badger and other mustelids 4.0%, roe deer 3.9%), cattle 9.4%, dog 7.4% (the dog most often in Turkey, Greece, and Spain; in Czechland only 3.2%), cat 4.3%, man 0.1% (23 cases: the first patient mostly infected by a dog, 8 times through transplantation of cornea).

Rabies was also occasionally diagnosed in cattle, donkey, cat, roe deer, rabbit, and some rodents (squirrel, kangaroo rat, cotton rat, vole, hamster).Transmission mode: percutaneous \u2013 biting of an infected mammal (virus in saliva), transplantation of cornea (8 cases), liver and kidneys (2 cases in Germany, infection of the donor originated in India).Human disease: rabies (lyssa) \u2013 encephalomyelitis with excitation, aerophobia (patient cannot stand breath of air over face), hydrophobia, anxiety, hallucinations and bizzare aggressive behaviour, eventually followed by paralysis, coma and terminating with death at full consciousness (without treatment, the fatality rate is 100%). Acute neurologic disease is divided into furious and paralytic (dumb) forms. Incubation period is long, 10 days to 6 months. The disease was known already in the Old Babylon, Egypt, Israel, India, China, ancient Greece and Rome. According to WHO, about 50,000\u201360,000 human deaths from rabies are estimated to occur annually, most often in Asia: e.g., about 20,000 cases in India (the Buddhist and Hindu ethics forbid culling the stray dogs; also in Thailand the killing of stray dogs is prohibited).Bio-containment: BSL-2/3.Diagnosis: anamnesis (animal bite); observation of the captured biting animal for the period of 5\u201310 days by a veterinarian, or post-mortem examination of the animal (histological slides of the brain and salivary glands \u2013 detection of antigen by the technique IF, Negri bodies or intracerebral inoculation of mouse); in the human patient, IF microscopy of corneal, mucosal and bioptic samples; also isolation on mice.Treatment: post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) is an immunization with several doses of vaccine combined with antiserum application (antirabic equine immunoglobuline).Prevention: vaccination of exposed persons \u2013 several effective inactivated rabies vaccines are currently available worldwide (the virus is cultivated in human diploid cells); obligatory immunization of pet dogs, reduction of foxes or their vaccination (baited oral vaccine with strain SAD, suggested by George M. Baer); the latter method has 80% effectivity in the fox populations. Oral vaccination of foxes started in Europe in Switzerland (1978), and it has then been used in France, Germany, Czechland and other countries.Geographical distribution: Lyssavirus s.s. occurs worldwide with the exception of Great Britain (the UK has applied a very strict policy since 1886: a 6-month quarantine for import or visit of dogs and cats), Ireland, Iceland, Japan, Australia, New Zealand and some other islands.

However, the reservoir are bats including fruit bats (experimental viraemia lasted up to 21 days in some species \u2013 Tadarida condylura, T. pumila, Epomophorus wahlbergi); hunted fruit bats can also be the source of infection. Recently, Ebolavirus RNA was detected in visceral organs of fruit bats Hypsignathus monstrosus, Epomops franquetti, and Myonycteris torquata.Animal disease: usually inapparent except for chimpanzee (fatality rate up to 50%), but experimental infection of monkeys often fatal. Reston virus is pathogenic to pig.Transmission mode: contact and alimentary (saliva, blood and excretions of primates, hunter contacts with dead chimpanzees and monkeys and their meat; tree fruit contaminated with bat saliva and other excreta), iatrogenic (inoculation, transfusions), less often aerogenic; high contagiosity \u2013 nosocomial and laboratory infections occur quite frequently. Funeral rituals are also a common risk factor during the outbreaks.Human disease: Ebola haemorrhagic fever, one of the most fatal human infectious diseases, with acute and severe headaches, pharyngitis, pains of muscles, sore back, abdominal pain, hiccups, severe diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, extreme fatigue and weakness, rash over whole body, neurological and psychotic disturbances (disorientation etc.), conjunctivitis, leucopenia, thrombocytopenia, effective blocking of interferon production, systemic haemorrhages, bloody faeces and bloody vomites, cachexia, hypovolemic shock and renal failure, the face looking as a mask; fatality rate 50\u201380%; a long-term convalescence. A number of mild or asymptomatic Ebolavirus infections have been observed in humans \u2013 in some enzootic areas (e.g., in Gabon) a relatively high proportion of population (about 10%) has antibodies to ebolavirus Zaire without being clinically ill before. Epidemics in the years 1976, 1979 and 1995 in Sudan and Zaire caused a total of 818 cases with a very high mortality: e.g., during the 1995 outbreak in Zaire 79% and in Sudan 53%. Other epidemic in Gabon 1994\u20131996 had 80 cases, 2000\u20132001 outbreak in Uganda with 428 cases (52% fatality rate), 2002\u20132004 central Africa (Gabon, DR Congo) 428 cases (fatality rate 78%). During the years 1976\u20132000 a total of 1,524 cases of Ebola fever were recorded, and 1,010 of the patients died. A more recent outbreak was reported from DR Congo (Luebo, Kasai province) in 2007: 372 cases (186 patients died); this outbreak was linked to a masssive migration of fruit bats hunted by villagers at the bat daily communal roosts situated often on palm trees close to the village. A large proportion of the human population living in forested areas of Gabon has both humoral and cellular immunity to Zaire ebolavirus. A new genotype, Bundibugyo virus, was the cause of 116 confirmed or probable haemorrhagic cases in western Uganda, 2007\u20132008, with a fatality rate of 34%). The C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire virus caused only one non-fatal haemorrhagic human case.Bio-containment: BSL-4.Diagnosis: isolation of the virus from the blood or other body fluids on Vero cells or in guinea pigs (extreme Biohazard level: BSL-4), electron microscopy, RT-PCR; detection of IgM in the blood (ELISA); immunohistochemistry (post-mortem).Treatment: therapy does not exist, ribavirin ineffective; only supportive care.Prevention: avoiding contact with infected humans or non-human primates and fruit bats (and their habitats like roosting sites in caves) infected with the virus.Geographical distribution: tropical Africa (Zaire = DR Congo (Photos 5.29, 5.30, 5.52), Gabon, Sudan, Uganda, Ivory Coast, Cameroon); the Philippines (Reston virus).\n",

            "text": "\nSource of infection (natural host range): man; in zoonotic influenza pig, horse, and fowl. Free-living waterfowl, gulls and shorebirds are the main reservoir of influenza A viruses in nature. Some wild anseriforms (swans, geese, ducks) also participate in the spread of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses.Animal disease: inapparent (in a majority of waterbirds) or fever, sinusitis, bronchopneumonia, oedema of the face and neck, cyanosis \u2013 e.g., \u201cfowl plague\u201d in hens due to HPAI virus subtypes H5 and H7, with a fatality rate 70\u2013100%; these subtypes may cause clinical disease also in some terrestrial and aquatic mammals.Transmission mode: aerogenic (a droplet infection), also by conjunctivae and contact. In the zoonotic HPAI H5N1 virus is the highest risk of human infection associated with processing of fowl (killing, removal of feather, cutting into portions), and in Asian animal markets with living fowl if it is infected. Human-to-human transmission of HPAI viruses has been absent or very rare.Human disease: influenza (an anthroponosis), often complicated with pneumonia, with the fatality rate of approximately 1%. The known anthroponotic influenza pandemics occurred in 1918/19 (\u2018Spain flu\u2019, H1N1, which killed about 21 million persons but some sources give as many as 40 million victims); 1957/58 (\u2018Asian flu\u2019, H2N2: >1 million victims; 1968/70 (\u2018Hongkong flu\u2019, H3N2: at least 700,000 deaths; 1977 (\u2018Russian flu\u2019, H1N1); and the recent pandemic of \u2018swine (Mexican) influenza\u2019 (H1N1) has encompassed 213 countries and caused 18,449 deaths (as of 1 August 2010). Except for the recent outbreak, all pandemic influenza A strains had in its genome inserted characteristic fragments of avian influenza viruses; they therefore emerged as reassortants of avian and mammalian influenza strains during co-infection of a susceptible mammal host (usually domestic pig as a \u2018mixing vessel\u2019). However, sporadical zoonotic influenza infections of humans with equine, swine and avian strains have been reported, usually without a further spread in human population. For instance in Wisconsin (1990) several pig breeders became ill, and one pregnant women died. This so-called swine influenza caused about 50 laboratory-confirmed cases (7 patients died) worldwide up to 2008. Another zoonotic problem is avian influenza; first cases of it were described in Hongkong (1997), where 18 persons were infected from chickens with the HPAI virus type H5N1 from chickens, and 6 of the patients died (one million hens had to be put down). In 2003, one veterinarian died after being infected with HPAI virus type H7N7 in the Netherlands (30 million chickens were then killed, and during this action 89 persons get fever with severe conjunctivitis). Further cases of infection with HPAI virus H5N1 acquired directly from chickens were reported in 2003\u20132010: from a total of 504 laboratory-confirmed human cases in 15 countries (reported to the WHO as of August 12, 2010), the highest incidence was in Indonesia (168 cases), Vietnam (119), and Egypt (111) \u2013 299 patients died (case fatality rate of 59%). The fatality rates of H5N1 avian influenza in humans have varied from 32% (Egypt) to 50% (Vietnam), 67% (China), 68% (Thailand), and 83% (Indonesia). During the same period, at least 200 million fowls were culled. Close contacts of humans with domestic ducks, chickens and pigs (common dwellings) in southeastern Asia present a permanent epidemiological risk into the future.Bio-containment: BSL-2 (but HPAI H5N1: BSL-2/3).Diagnosis: isolation and cultivation in chick embryos or on cell cultures, detection of antigen or RNA in the samples, serology (HIT).Treatment: antivirotics amantadin, rimantadin, zanamivir (Relenza), oseltamivir (Tamiflu) might moderate the clinical course, but resistant strains of influenza A have already appeared.Prevention: vaccine (human and fowl), culling of infected animal breeds.Geographical distribution: worldwide; most strains of zoonotic influenza originate in Southeast Asia.\n",

Experimental infection successful in pig, monkey, sheep and rat.Transmission mode: alimentary (food-borne: raw or undercooked swine liver and intestine, deer liver meat contaminated with the virus; or water-borne: drinking of water contaminated with contaminated sewage disposal); person-to-person transmission (among household members during outbreaks); parenteral (blood transfusion during a viraemic period), mother-to-child transmission (scarcely documented).Human disease: hepatitis E \u2013 after a long incubation period (15\u201360 d., median about 40 d.) starts severe fatigue, gastroenteritis and acute hepatitis (increased levels of liver enzymes ALT and AST); fatality rate <1%. The infection is dangerous for pregnant women (with an up to 25% fatality rate). Big epidemics have been repeatedly reported in so-called endemic areas (and caused by anthroponotic strains): 1955 India 30,000 cases; 1976 Myanmar 20,000; 1978 Kashmir 52,000 (1,500 patients died); 1986 China 100,000 and Somalia 11,000; 1989 Mexico 4,000. The zoonotic hepatitis E, which occurs mainly in so-called non-endemic areas (Europe, North America, Japan), is probably an underdiagnosed disease (a number of subclinical cases occur). For instance, 116 cases of hepatitis E were diagnosed in Hungary from 2001 to 2006.Bio-containment: BSL-2.Diagnosis: isolation on cell cultures, IF; serology \u2013 VNT, ELISA (IgM anti-HEV).Geographical distribution: zoonotic genotype III probably worldwide, it has been demonstrated in Japan, Korea, Indonesia, China, France, Great Britain, Sweden, Spain, the Netherlands, Czechland, Hungary, Greece, USA and Africa, while the other zoonotic genotype IV is restricted to India and East Asia. Anthroponotic genotype I extensively circulates in Asia (including India, Pakistan, Nepal, Bangladesh, China, Kyrgyzstan, and Uzbekistan) and Africa (including Egypt, Algeria, Morocco, Namibia, Sudan and Chad); genotype II occurs in Mexico and in some African countries (Nigeria, Namibia, Chad, and Sudan).\n",

Another species of the genus Francisella is F. philomiragia, living saprophytically in water, being of low pathogenicity for man. There are also ichthyopathogenic francisellae recorded in marine fish farms in USA, Japan and Norway which are not pathogenic for endothermic vertebrates and are unable to grow at 37\u00b0C. Very interesting are the francisellae living as endosymbionts in metastriate ixodid ticks especially of the genus Dermacentor in the Holarctis. The new findings indicate two probable trajectories of evolutionary adaptation from saprophytism to parasitism within the genus Francisella: (a) via water organisms; (b) via ixodid ticks.",

Very recent data show that F. tularensis could also be an endosymbiont or commensal of water amoebae of the genus Acanthamoeba, the bacterium being able to replicate in these protozoa and survive in their cysts for several weeks. The interaction between aquatic and terrestrial cycles of F. tularensis is largely unknown.Animal disease: tularaemia (usually lethal epizootics of hares, rabbits and rodents; sometimes sheep \u2013 only with the type A; subcutaneous nodules in dogs).Transmission mode (Fig. 8.19): unusually varied \u2013 direct contact (e.g. skinning the infected animals); bites of ixodid ticks Dermacentor (reservoir, TST and TOT demonstrated) \u2013 D. variabilis, D. andersoni, D. reticulatus, Amblyomma americanum, rarely Ixodes ricinus complex, and in certain areas also mechanical transmission by bites of tabanids Chrysops spp. (\u201cdeerfly disease\u201d \u2013 USA, Russia) while reports on transmission by mosquito bites are unsubstantiated at present (Scandinavia); alimentary (water or food contaminated by infected rodents); aerogenic (inhalation of contaminated aerosol or dust during the work with hay, straw or other agricultural products including sugar beet \u2013 outbreaks in sugar refineries in central and eastern Europe: Austria, Czechland, Slovakia, Ukraine). An unusual air-borne outbreak of tularaemia occurred among hunters (39 cases, 1 person died) in Hesse, Germany, 2005: the infection occurred when aerosol was generated during rinsing with a water hose of disemboweled hares (some of them being infected) after the hunt. High tenacity of the microbe at low temperatures \u2013 at 4\u00b0C F. tularensis survives up to 4 months. Interestingly, F. tularensis survives in Acanthamoeba castellanii cysts for up to several weeks; trophozoites of this amoeba encyst rapidly in response to infection with F. tularensis.Human disease: tularaemia \u2013 sudden fever, chills, headache, backache, hyperhidrosis, diarrhoea, anorexia; then according to the entrance gate different clinical forms: (1) (ulcero-/oculo-)glandular (bubonic) with the primary ulcer on the skin and regional painful lymphadenitis; (2) pulmonary (pneumonia); (3) abdominal (typhoid, oropharyngeal, gastrointestinal); or (4) generalized (septic); fatality rate is about 5% (but up to 30% in the typhoid form) in USA; while in Eurasia <3% (due to absence of the highly virulent type A tularaemia); convalescence is long (2\u20133 months or more), especially in improperly treated illness. Occupational disease: farmers, hunters or trappers of leporids and big rodents (caught for skin, e.g. muskrats), workers in veterinary laboratories. There was a big outbreak of hare/rodent-borne tularaemia in Central Europe (Austria, Czechoslovakia) in 1936/1937, with many hundreds of patients. A recent (1999\u20132000) outbreak of largely alimentary tularaemia in Kosovo involved 327 confirmed cases; the main source were rodents, overpopulated during the Civil War in this region. The first two outbreaks of tularaemia in Spain occurred in 1997 and 1998, and were associated with hare hunting (585 patients) and crayfish (Procambarus clarkii) fishing in a contaminated freshwater stream, respectively. In the USA from 1990 to 2000, the average annual number of human cases of tularaemia was 124 (the range, 86\u2013193); however, prior to 1950 there were many hundreds of cases annually (maximum in 1939: 2,291 reported patients). For comparison, in the Central-European Czechland (about 10 million population), the annual incidence averaged in the same decade 75 cases (the range, 12\u2013225); an absolute maximum of tularaemia incidence in Czechland was recorded in 1962, with a total of 1,468 reported (serologically confirmed) patients.Diagnosis: symptomatology, anamnesis, serology (AR, ELISA etc. \u2013 possible cross-reactivity with brucellae), subcutaneous inoculation of adult laboratory mouse (MLD is 1 cell!), cultivation of the blood or ulcer secreta samples on TGKA (glucose BA with thioglycollate) or cysteine BA, PCR; past infection could well be detected by an intradermal test with tularin; IF microscopy of lesion secreta, immunohistochemistry.Bio-containment: BSL-2/3. (MID for man is as low as 10 viable cells applied intradermally or by inhalation). Considered as a bioterrorist agent (but only the type A tularaemia might be dangerous).Treatment: streptomycin, gentamicin (tetracycline, chloramphenicol); exstirpation of enlarged lymph nodes.Prevention: vaccination by scarification (the attentuated Russian strain, LVS) \u2013 but routinely the vaccine is inaccessible.Geographical distribution: holarctic (Eurasia and North America). F. t. tularensis (A) only occurs in North America, and F. t. mediasiatica only in Central Asia. For a natural focus of tularaemia, see Photo 5.42.\n\n",

They often form biofilms in water habitats (water mains, cooling towers, etc.) and are resistant to standard disinfection compounds and measures. Potting soil is an alternative infections source of L. pneumophila and other Legionella species (especially in Australia and New Zealand, but rarely in Europe or North America).Transmission mode: aerogenic \u2013 inhalation of aerosol (water droplets) containing the bacteria.Human disease: two clinical forms \u2013 (1) legionellosis (Legionnaires\u2019 disease, LD) \u2013 pneumonia with high fever (up to 41\u00b0C), chills and dry to spasmodic cough, headache, neurological and psychotic disturbances (confusion, anxiety), somnolence, vomiting, diarrhoea, damage to visceral organs (liver, kidneys); fatality rate 10\u201325%; the disease is most dangerous for smokers and immunosuppressed persons; (2) Pontiac fever (the agent is, e.g., L. anisa), a flu-like illness with a sudden onset, myalgia and headache, but without any pulmonary affliction; mortality has not been reported. Very susceptible to both forms of legionellosis are immunosuppressed persons. Epidemics of legionellosis: first known in 1976 during a meeting of American legionnaires in Philadelphia: 221 patients (34 died; the agent, L. pneumophila was isolated and identified from the air-conditioning system in the meeting hotel); retrospectively (serologically), another outbreak of atypical pneumonia with 19 cases including 14 fatal in a psychiatric clinic in Washington was resolved as legionellosis; 1977, five smaller epidemics of legionellosis (total about 135 cases) in Ohio, Vermont, Tennessee, Los Angeles (USA) and Nothingham (UK); 1985, an outbreak (14 cases, 3 fatal) of LD after a banquet in Michigan; 1989, 34 LD cases (2 fatal) in Louisiana; 1998, 45 cases of Pontiac fever in Wisconsin (caused by a whirlpool); 1998, Institute of Clinical and Experimental Medicine in Prague 13 patients with transplanted organs (8 died; the source of LD was contaminated warm water in the institution); 1999, Bovenkarspel (the Netherlands) 233 LD cases (22 died) after a visit of exhibition of consumer goods including warmwater whirling baths (the source of infection); 1999, 22 cases of Pontiac fever in a hotel in Georgia, USA; 2000, 20 cases of Pontiac fever (from a hotel whirlpool) in Wisconsin; 2000, Melbourne 101 LD patients (5 died) after a visit of sea aquarium; 2000, Vigo (Spain) 28 LD patients were infected during hospitalisation due to other disease, and 3 died; 2002, 117 cases of Pontiac fever caused by L. anisa at a restaurant in Tennessee; 2004, 66 cases of Pontiac fever among visitors of a hotel in Oklahoma; 2010, Ulm (Germany) 65 patients (5 deaths; a community outbreak of LD associated with a water cooling system), and Barcelona (43 cases of Pontiac fever).Bio-containment: BSL-2.Diagnosis: serology (paired serum samples: IFA, AR, ELISA); detection of the agent in sputum and other excreta or by bronchoalveolar lavage (IF; PCR could detect viable, but non-cultivable cells); cultivation on a special BCYE agar medium containing yeast extract, cysteine, iron ionts and charcoal in 5% CO2 (LLAP need the presence of amoebae for growth); antigen detection in urine (ELISA, PCR).Treatment: clarithromycin, erythromycin, tetracycline, levofloxacin, azithromycin, rifampicin (penicillin and ampicillin are ineffective).Geographical distribution: worldwide, but (surprisingly) mainly in the temperate zone.

C. burnetii has a very high tenacity in milieu: it resists drying and light exposure for many months: for instance on wool, cotton or in tick excrements it remains viable for a number of months, and in the soil for up to 20 days. The agent is extremely contagious and man is highly susceptible to infection. Exoanthropic cycle: rodents and wild ruminants (deer) + ixodid ticks (Metastriata). Synanthropic cycle: among domestic ruminants (contact). Some flies feeding on the faeces, milk, carcasses, or blood of infected domestic animals can spread C. burnetii mechanically.Human disease: Q fever (Q meaning \u201cquery\u201d), first described (by Edward Derrick) in butchers working in a slaughterhouse in Brisbane (Queensland, Australia) in 1935\u20131937 \u2013 sudden fever and chills, often recurrent, hyperhidrosis, weakness, intense headaches, fatigue, myalgia, arthralgia, atypical pneumonia (infiltrate, but not always), weight loss, myo- and endocarditis, rash does not occur (contrary to rickettsioses), sometimes meningitis; hepatitis (increased levels of transaminases); fatality rate \u22641%; often inapparent or abortive infections (one-third to one-half of cases), on the other hand also chronical course occurs in 1\u20133% of cases, accompanied with a latency period of several years (the agent persists in liver and spleen) and a characteristic subsequent endocarditis, sometimes granulomatous hepatitis (granulomas could also appear in the bone marrow). Reactivation of a latent or chronic infection can occur in gravidity (coxiellae are then present in placenta). Many smaller epidemics occur often in some Balkan countries, e.g. in Bulgaria have been reported hundreds of cases in conjuction with a rapid expansion of goat breeding since the 1990s. A very similar story is the recent (2008\u20132010, still ongoing) major outbreak of Q fever in the Netherlands where many farmers moved from cattle and pig breeding to goat (and sheep) breeding in recent years (there were >350,000 goats present in the Netherlands in 1999); 86 commercial dairy goat farms (i.e. 24% of all commercial goat farms) have been involved as of April 22, 2010, and the incidence of Q fever in humans has been unusually high. This epidemic started sneakingly, with only 5 human cases in 2005, 12 cases in 2006, 127 cases in 2007, but as many as 1,014 cases were reported in 2008 (with one fatal case), 2,357 cases (6 fatalities) in 2009, and 421 cases in 2010 (as of end July); the situation resulted in a mass culling of goats (>10,000 animals). Recently, new cases of Q fever also occur in Belgium, Germany (848 human cases were reported in 2006\u20132009), France, UK, Canada, USA, and Australia. In 2009, several patients with Q fever endocarditis were described in a settlement in eastern Greenland \u2013 the likely animal source included sled dogs and seals. Q fever is an occupational disease with a risk for breeders and attendants of small domestic ruminants (goat, sheep), veterinarians (delivery in ruminants), butchers; also many laboratory infections are known. For instance, a teacher and 33 students (of 48 exposed) acquired Q fever during veterinary practice in a Slovenian sheep farm in 2007.Bio-containment: BSL-3.Diagnosis: serology (micro-AR, IFA, CFT; antigen phase II indicates acute infection, while antigen I confirms the chronic stage of Q fever; in ELISA there can occur cross-reactions with Chlamydophila psittaci), intraperitoneal inoculation of the blood sample in guinea pig, mouse or on chick embryo (patients have intense bacteraemia during acute phase of the illness, but the isolation is a risky operation); staining after Gim\u00e9nez or Giemsa, immunohistochemistry; PCR.Treatment: doxycycline, tetracycline, chloramphenicol (they shorten febrile period, but do not kill the intracellularly localized coxiellae), cotrimoxazole in children and pregnant women; a recommended combinations in chronic cases of Q fever are doxycycline with hydroxychloroquine, rifampicin or cotrimoxazole.Prevention: Australian vaccine is approved for humans (it is prepared from the phase I); the protection is assumed to last 10 years. Culling of infected small ruminant herds according to the \u201ctest (bulk milk samples tested by PCR) and slaughter\u201d policy. In addition, mandatory vaccination of small ruminants started in the Netherlands in 2009.Geographical distribution: worldwide, most often in steppe habitats with brush of the Mediterranean and Black Sea regions (Photo 5.31), or in analogous Australian habitats.\n\n",

Typhimurium, S. Enteritidis and other serovars), some ectothermic vertebrates.Animal disease: usually inapparent course, or enteritis acute (young animals) or chronic (adults); abortions. Salmonellae are able to persist for a long time in visceral organs of mammals (spleen, liver, kidney, biliary duct) and in oviducts of fowl. S. Dublin and S.

Great tenacity of S.

The most frequent serovars are S.\nEnteritidis (frequent phagotypes are European PT4 and American PT8; \u2013 they have been panzootic and pandemic in the 1990s) and S.\nTyphimurium, less common are e.g. S.\nVirchow,\nS.\nAgona, and a number of others. Incidence of salmonellosis in the USA: 1956 reported 1,700 cases, while 1965 already 20,865. A similar increase of incidence was recorded in European countries; for instance in Czechland: 1,981 reported cases in 1955, 4,975 in 1965, 7,678 in 1975, 8,492 in 1985, and 52,588 in 1995. A considerable increase of the incidence in Czechland was reported in 1989, from 11 to 24 thousands of cases (it was caused by import of pandemic strain of the serovar S. Enteritidis from west Europe and USA), and the subsequent mean salmonella morbidity in the years 1990\u20132000 was 43,450 cases annually. While the incidence rate of salmonellosis per 100,000 population in Czechland was 385 in 1997, the average for Europe in the same year was 20\u2013130, but it could be biased by underreporting (or no obligatory reporting) of the disease in some European countries. An instructive outbreak of salmonellosis occurred in Minnesota in 1994 with 224,000 patients (the largest salmonellosis outbreak in the U.S.A.): infective vehiculum was ice cream, and the mechanism was contamination with S. Enteritidis of a tank transporting egg melange used for preparation of that ice cream. The economical costs of salmonellosis can be high: it has been calculated that diagnosis and therapy of one human case of this disease in EU countries will cost on average 1,100\u20ac. [Remark: typhoid fever (typhus abdominalis) and paratyphoid fever, caused by S. Typhi and S. Paratyphi, respectively, are anthroponoses characteristic by a subsequent chronic asymptomatic carriership in 1\u201310% of patients].Bio-containment: BSL-2.Diagnosis: cultivation of faecal samples in semiselective enrichment fluid media, e.g. tetrathionate or selenite enrichment broth, with a subsequent inoculation on selective solid agar media with deoxycholate, brilliant green etc. (MAL, XLD, SS, Rambach, Wilson-Blair and others); serotypization and phagotypization (PT), PCR (RFLP).Treatment: rehydration (antibiotics prolong the carriership stage; they are used only in necessary cases and after sensitivity testing, especially in toddlers); Endiaron N.Geographical distribution: worldwide.\n",

The number of VTEC cases in the European Union was 2,905 in 2007. A major outbreak of EHEC occurred in Toronto area in Canada in 2000 when >2000 people got infection (and 6 children died) \u2013 the infection vehiculum was a contaminated water from a farm.Bio-containment: BSL-2.Diagnosis: cultivation of faecal samples (differentiating MacConkey agar with sorbitol, so-called SMAC, or even more selective Rainbow O157 agar), with a subsequent typization and toxigenicity testing.Treatment: rehydration, exceptionally antibiotics (ampicillin, cephalosporins).Geographical distribution: worldwide.\n",

In North America the source of human infection is occasionally cat that hunted infected rodents in a natural focus.Animal disease: sometimes latent; but more often a general illness, e.g. in brown rats and other rodents (MID in them is about 10 cells), cats (may be severely affected), goats and camels.Transmission mode (Fig. 8.21): fleas of the genera Xenopsylla (especially X. cheopsis, that after death of its rat host easily moves to man as an alternative host; also X. brasiliensis), Oropsylla (O. montana in California, the marmot flea O. silantiewi in Mongolia), Monopsyllus, Nosopsyllus (China), possibly also the human flea Pulex irritans (Tanzania). Bacteraemia in mammalian donors of agent should be at least 108 cells/ml blood. The imbibed plague bacilli replicate and form a \u201cblock\u201d in the flea\u2019s proventriculus that limits the ability of the flea of further blood feeding (Fig. 10.1007/978-90-481-9657-9_6#Fig6_14_212076_1_En), and leads to regurgitation. TOT has not been demonstrated in fleas. Other means of plague transmission are aerogenic (person-to-person, droplets during cough) which results in the most feared epidemics, and alimentary \u2013 e.g. 18 plague cases were described after consumption of uncooked liver of infected camels in Libya and Saudi Arabia. The plague sometimes occurs as an occupational infectious disease \u2013 hunters of marmots and other rodents: e.g. 19 marmot hunters (handling infected animals or their carcasses) got plague in north China in 2004, and 8 died. An alternative (but speculative) mode for Y. pestis transmission during outbreaks might be via the body lice Pediculus humanus.Types of disease foci: (1) primary, natural, sylvatic (the hosts of the agent are exoanthropic rodents) in steppe, semidesert or tropical forest ecosystems; (2) secondary, urban \u2013 largely in sea ports (the main hosts of the agent are rats \u2013 \u201curban\u201d plague).Human disease: plague (pestis) starting with fever and fatigue. The clinical forms are bubonic (bubonic plague, with lymphadenitis: swollen and extremely painful lymph nodes called buboes), pulmonary (severe bronchopneumonia and respiratory distress syndrome \u2013 usually in the anthroponotic infection), oroglandular (after an alimentary infection, associated with abdominal pain and diarrhoea), and primarily septic (without lymphadenitis, but with meningitis, endotoxic shock, organ failure and a disseminated intravascular coagulation); occasional severe peripheral tissue necrosis and gangrene remind of medieval epithet (\u201cBlack Death\u201d). Mean fatality rate is 2\u201310% in treated and 50\u201395% in untreated cases (the most lethal are septic and pulmonary forms). Historically, the first major epidemic of plague was reported in China in 224 BC. Later on, three pandemics of plague were recorded: (1) \u201cJustinian\u2019s plague\u201d in the sixth century (with roughly 100 million victims out of the 142 million infected); (2) \u201cblack death\u201d in the fourteenth century killed nearly whole populations of Tatars and Saracens, then the disease encompassed nearly whole Europe where died one-fourth of the population (about 25 millions), and further roughly 25 millions died before in Asia and Africa; (3) \u201cmodern\u201d plague in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries (30 million people got the disease, 12 millions of them died; the pandemic started in Hongkong after introduction from the continental China; rats and their fleas dispersed plague on ships to many seaports of Japan, India, Europe, Africa, America and Australia). According to new molecular data, probably only the biovar Orientalis of Y. pestis participated in all three pandemics. The last outbreak of pulmonary plague was recorded in Los Angeles in 1924, with 32 cases (30 were fatal). In India, there were 52 fatal cases of plague in 1994. Another outbreak with 18 cases (the bubonic form) occurred in Oran (Algeria) in 2003 (here after more than 50 years). Sporadic cases of plague still occur in a limited number of natural foci in the world. For instance, on average 10 human cases are reported annually from western USA. However according to WHO, there are 1,000\u20132,500 cases of plague reported each year worldwide; for instance, a total incidence of plague in the years 1987\u20132001 was 36,876 persons, and 2,847 (7.7%) died. Recent outbreak of plague in Peru (2010) involved 31 cases including 3 deaths (the last outbreak of bubonic plague in northern Peru before was in 1994, which affected more than 1,100 persons and killed 35 of them).Bio-containment: BSL-3.Diagnosis: microscopy (methylene blue) and cultivation (BA, agar with gentianviolet at 27\u00b0C) of the pus from enlarged lymph nodes, blood, CSF, bone marrow or sputum samples, subcutaneous inoculation of guinea pig, laboratory rat or mouse; serology (IFA, CFT, RIHA).Treatment: streptomycin, tetracycline, doxycycline, chloramphenicol, gentamicin.Prevention: vaccine (inactivated or attenuated \u2013 strain EV76 produced in the former Soviet Union, or heat-killed Y. pestis vaccine manufactured in Australia) produces a short-term protection; rat control in endemic areas.Geographical distribution: natural foci of plague occur in parts of Asia (India \u2013 Photo 5.39, Burma, Iraq, central Asia, Mongolia \u2013 Photo 5.40, northern China), Africa (including Madagascar \u2013 here recently 45% of all African cases), South America and western North America (USA: Oregon, California, Nevada, Arizona, Colorado, Utah, New Mexico, and Texas).\n\n",

The cholera enterotoxin stimulates hyperproduction of cAMP that inhibits in the cells of intestinal villi influx of ions Na+ and Cl\u2013and at the same time stimulates hypersecretion of Cl\u2013and HCO3\u2013 causing a blockade of intestinal water influx. V. cholerae non-O1 causes less severe but sometimes bloody diarrhoea and abdominal spasms. A total of 10 explosive pandemics of cholera occurred in the nineteenth and twentieth century, and most of them were initiated in the Indian subcontinent.

A new serotype O139 Bengal caused first outbreak in Bangladesh in 1992, and reemerged there in 2002 (about 30,000 cases).

Incidence rate was 20\u2013110 per 100,000 population in Europe in 1996\u20131999, while 7\u201332 in the USA (that of salmonellosis was 13\u201326 in the same period). In Great Britain the annual incidence of campylobacterosis attained 50,000 cases in the years 1997\u20131999 and surpassed that of salmonellosis (51,800 cases in 2007). A similar trend was observed in Czechland (EPIDAT Report on incidence of infectious diseases): while the mean annual incidence was 8,630 cases in the decade 1990\u20132000, as many as 23,480 cases (annual average; the range, 20\u201330 thousands) were reported in the period 2001\u20132008, i.e. not much less than in salmonellosis in the same period (annual average 25,800, the range 11,000\u201333,000 cases). However, this obviously increasing trend could be biased by a much better and more widespread laboratory diagnosis of campylobacterosis.Bio-containment: BSL-2.Diagnosis: microscopy of native stool samples in darkfield, cultivation of faeces (sampled in a special transport medium), blood or CSF on selective Preston agar with charcoal and cefoperazon or on other special agar media (Karmali; Butzler) at 42\u00b0C in 5\u201310% CO2 and 85% N2; serology (ELISA, CFT), PCR.Treatment: rehydration; antibiotics should be used only in severe cases (erythromycin, tetracycline, azithromycin, clarithromycin, ciprofloxacin). Campylobacters are usually resistant to quinolones (these drugs used to be occasionally added to chicken food).Geographical distribution: worldwide.\n",

Leptospirae are very resistant in water milieu; they can also be transported by waterbirds (from and to rice fields etc.).Animal disease: inapparent, or (cattle, pig) abortions, meningitis and dying of some young animals.Transmission mode: contact (percutaneous; bathing, water sports, work in water or in sewers), alimentary (water or food contaminated with rodent urine, e.g. after floods; uncooked meat of infected animals).Human disease: leptospirosis is one of the most widespread zoonoses in the world \u2013 a flu-like illness, often with biphasic body temperature curve, aseptic meningitis and nephritis (albuminuria). The course of the disease varies according to serovar; the most severe is Weil\u2019s disease (L. interrogans Icterohaemorrhagiae) with hepatitis, icterus, myalgia, necroses, cardiac and ocular involvement, nephritis (damage to glomerulae; leptospiruria), haemorrhagies, encephalitis, and fatality rate in untreated cases 10\u201320%; milder but most frequent is the \u201charvest fever\u201d in central Europe (caused by L. interrogans Grippotyphosa); also other anicteric leptospiroses usually have milder symptoms, e.g. \u201cfever of swine breeders\u201d (L. interrogans Pomona). The incidence of leptospirosis is not very high in most countries; for instance in Czechland, on the average 82 (the range, 12\u2013226) cases were reported annually in the years 1970\u20131999, while 38 (the range, 11\u201388) in the decade 1990\u20132000 (0.4 cases per 100,000 population); in France, an average of about 250 cases annually have been reported since 1980 (0.5 cases/100,000). Occupational disease: up to 30% of cases form butchers in slaughterhouses, farmers, meat inspectors, workers in sewerage system, miners, soldiers, gamekeepers, hunters, rodent control workers, sugar cane cutters, ricefield workers, animal attendants in zoological gardens and workers in sewerage system; leptospirosis also often occurs as a \u201crecreational\u201d (leisure time) infectious disease (about 30% of all cases) \u2013 during outdoor activities like water sports (canoeing, swimming), or camping. Epidemics also follow natural disasters, such as floods, hurricanes or earthquakes. For instance, 167 Philippinos died from leptospirosis after storm Ondoy flooded Manila and Rizal in 2009.Bio-containment: BSL-2.Diagnosis: microscopy (darkfield or phase contrast) and cultivation (EMJH [Ellinghausen-McCullough-Johnson-Harris] medium, Korthoff\u2019s fluid peptone medium supplemented with rabbit serum or bovine albumin and Tween 80, or Fletcher, Noguchi and Stuart liquid media; however, the growth of leptospirae is slow) of the blood (acute stadium) or urine (convalescence) samples; intraperitoneal inoculation of young guinea pig or hamster; serology (CFT, slide AR, IHA, ELISA; the most specific is the micro-agglutination-lysis test, when a viable culture is mixed with antiserum, and then observed under darkfield microscope); RFLP, ribotyping, PFGE.Treatment: penicillin, ampicillin, doxycycline, tetracycline, streptomycin, erythromycin, ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, ciprofloxacin; haemodialysis is sometimes necessary during renal insufficiency.Prevention: vaccination of domestic animals (cattle, pigs, dogs) is possible with serovar-specific vaccines. Vaccines for humans are produced in France (serovar Icterohaemorrhagiae), China and Japan (serovars Canicola, Icterohaemorrhagiae and Pomona).Geographical distribution: worldwide (mainly humid ecosystems: Photo 5.38).\n",

B. burgdorferi can sometimes persist in the human body for long periods (up to 10 years), e.g. in synovial fluid or in the CNS (often in changed morphological forms \u2013 cystic, circular or granular). LB is the most frequent ixodid tick-borne human disease in the world, with an estimated 85,000 patients annually (Europe 65,000, North America 16,500, Asia 3,500).

The \u2018cystic forms\u2019 or \u2018blebs\u2019 are impossible to diagnose in darkfield microscopy.Treatment: doxycycline, amoxicilin, penicillin, tetracycline, erythromycin, deoxymykoin in the acute phase; in the chronic phase cephalosporins (cefotaxim, ceftriaxon), or big doses of penicillin.Prevention: suitable human vaccine against LB does not exist at present. The lately released US vaccine \u201cLYMErix\u201d was removed from the market several years ago.

The agent\u2019s tenacity is remarkable: it survives at a lower temperature 1 year or more, and tolerates, e.g., 10% NaCl. L. monocytogenes also survives in macrophages, and its virulence is activated by contact with gastric fluid of the host.Human disease: listeriosis \u2013 often inapparent infection. Incubation period of listeriosis is very long, on the average one month but sometimes up to 70 days. The symptoms of listeriosis are fever, headaches, chills, pharyngitis, nausea, mononucleosis, purulent meningitis (in up to a quarter of cases), encephalitis, endocarditis, granulomas and abscesses in liver, subcutis and other organs, septicaemia (bacteraemia) in half of the cases; fatality rate is up to 20\u201330% (mortality usually occurs in old persons, at immunosuppression or at a large infectious dose). Characteristically, there is no enteritis. A dangerous disease is the listeriosis in pregnant women usually leading to miscarriage or pre-term delivery of babies associated with septicaemia, severe damage to CNS and visceral organs; fatality rate is high, 30\u201380%. L. monocytogenes has namely a considerable tropism for the CNS, placenta and uterus of mammals. Extensive epidemics of listeriosis after consumption of contaminated food (cheese etc.) occurred in USA, Switzerland, France, Denmark and Germany (serotype 4b, a few hundreds of persons) in the years 1985\u20131990. A total of 1,566 persons (292 of them hospitalized) were infected with the serotype 4b of L. monocytogenes in northern Italy in 1999; the source of infection was a maize salad with tuna fish. An increased incidence of listeriosis was also observed in UK and other European countries in 2001 and 2003. In the European Union the incidence of listeriosis has been growing moderately since 2004: from 1,264 total cases, to 1,427 cases in 2005, 1,583 in 2006, and 1,554 in 2007; it corresponds to the incidence rate of 0.3 per 100,000 population; the mortality rate remains high, about 20%. L. ivanovii is an enteric opportunistic pathogen, causing occasionally gastroenteritis and bacteraemia in man; the isolates are indistinguishable from ruminant strains.Bio-containment: BSL-2.Diagnosis: cultivation of the blood, CSF, placenta samples (MPA, BA; optimally after a semi-selective replication in enrichment broth at 4\u00b0C and subsequently at 37\u00b0C), CAMP test with Rhodococcus equi or Staphylococcus aureus, inoculation of mouse (treated with cortisone); serology less useful (CFT), PCR.Treatment: ampicillin, azithromycin, gentamicin, large doses of penicillin plus kanamycin, tetracycline, chloramphenicol.Geographical distribution: worldwide (less often in tropics), ubiquitous.

Another outbreak occurred in Vietnam, 2007, involved 45 cases (at least two patients died).Bio-containment: BSL-2.Diagnosis: anamnesis; cultivation (BA) of throat swabs, CSF and blood samples; biochemical tests (API 20 Strep System); serotypisation; MLST. S. suis might be misidentified as a member of the viridans group streptococci.Treatment: penicillin.Geographical distribution: worldwide, S. suis is more common in southeast Asia, and China sporadic in mild climatic zone (UK, the Netherlands, Germany, Czechland, Slovakia, Croatia, Greece, New Zealand, USA, Canada).\n",

A closely related species, H. farciminosum, causes histoplasmosis in horses.Transmission mode: aerogenic (ground works on bird roosting sites, demolition of old buildings, visits of caves contaminated with bat and oilbird droppings).Human disease: histoplasmosis \u2013 primarily a pulmonary disease characterized with pneumonia and lymphadenopathy, similar to tuberculosis (lung calcification), with a good prognosis; however, generalized or progressive clinical forms (approximately 1% of all cases) may result in hepatosplenomegaly, the CNS infection, ulceration of digestive tract and other severe manifestations with high lethality. Pulmonary histoplasmosis might be chronic, and with relapses. The course of disease is severe in immunocompromised patients (e.g., AIDS) as well.

Within the human host, the promastigote forms are ingested by macrophages where they change into amastigote forms. Main vectors of leishmaniasis in the Mediterranean region are e.g., P. neglectus, P. perfilievi, P. perniciosus, P. papatasi (L. major), P. arabicus; elsewhere in the world P. martini, P. orientalis, P. chinensis, P. sergenti (L. tropica), P. duboscqui (L. major), P. alexandri, P. argentipes, P. longipes (L. aethiopica), P. pedifer (L. aethiopica), Lutzomyia longipalpis, L. olmeca (L. mexicana), L. wellcomei (L. braziliensis), L. carrerai (L. braziliensis). New experimental molecular data surprisingly indicate possible transmission of L. infanti by the dog tick Rhipicephalus sanguineus, including TOT in the tick (Exp. Parasitol. 125: 184\u2013185, 2010). The transmission of leshmaniasis is also possible from man to man by the blood transfusion, inoculation (sharing contaminated needles), or congenitally.Cycles: exoanthropic (deserts, savannah, tropical rainforests), and synanthropic (domestical, urban).Human disease: leishmaniasis, a chronic disease with incubation period from a week up to 1 year (sometimes longer in visceral form) and manifesting in several clinical forms: (1) visceral (L. infantum, L. donovani [\u201ckala-azar\u201d], in America L. chagasi) \u2013 disease of RES, with fever, hepatosplenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, cachexia, thrombocytopenia, anaemia, leucopenia, hyperglobulinemia and if untreated with a high fatality rate; (2) cutaneous with skin ulcers on face, arms, and legs (L. tropica causes anthroponotic urban form, L. major causes zoonotic form, L. aethiopica \u2013 restricted to East Africa; in America L. mexicana causes a disseminated cutaneous form Chicler\u2019s ulcer, destructive disease of otis media, L. donovani in Sri Lanka, L. peruviana \u2013 Uta disease); two types of cutaneous leishmaniosis are differentiated: (a) urbanus (\u201cdry form\u201d) \u2013 dry ulcer, late ulcerating, with synanthropic cycle (L. tropica, L. aethiopica); (b) rusticus (\u201cwet form\u201d) \u2013 large acute ulcer, early necrotizing, with exoanthropic cycle (L. major). (3) The mucocutaneous \u201cespundia\u201d form occurs in America and affects nasopharyngeal mucosa with deforming lesions and tissue damage in the mouth, ears or nose that resemble leprosis (L. braziliensis). Leishmania/HIV co-infection is getting an emerging problem worldwide. According to WHO report, 12 million people in the world suffer from leishmaniasis, the number of new cases is about 1.5 million annually and c. 50,000 die. In Africa, the mean yearly number of new cases of visceral leishmaniasis is 19,000\u201324,000. However, 100,000 persons died during a massive outbreak of visceral leishmaniasis in south Sudan between the years 1985 and 1987. Ninety percent of visceral leishmaniasis cases occur in Bangladesh, Brazil, India, Nepal and Sudan; 90% of mucocutaneous leishmaniasis occurs in Bolivia, Brazil and Peru; and 90% of cutaneous leishmaniasis occur in Afghanistan, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Brazil and Peru. The annual incidence in Europe (southern only) is much lower, about 750 cases. Asymptomatic infections of humans with Leishmania are 30\u2212100 times more frequent than the clinical cases. DNA of L. donovani was amplified from ancient Egyptian and Nubian mummies 4,000 years old.Bio-containment: BSL-2.Diagnosis: microscopy of amastigotes (biopsy \u2013 lymph nodes, scrapings, smears: amastigote forms 2.5\u20135\u00d72 \u03bcm, replicating in monocytes, macrophages; punctate from spleen or sternum in visceral leishmaniasis), cultivation (NNN agar), inoculation of mouse or Syrian hamster (ears, tail), serology (IFA, ELISA or haemagglutination test in visceral and mucocutaneous leishmaniasis), intradermal test, PCR.Treatment: derivatives of pentavalent antimony (natrium stilbogluconate, megluminantimonate, pentamidine), pyrimethamine (Daraprim), amphotericin B (the most effective in liposomal form in visceral leishmaniasis: AmBiosome) or ketoconazole (in cutaneous leishmaniasis), cycloguanyl, miltefosine, N-chlorotaurin (L. donovani); local injections of ulcers, cryotherapy.Prevention and risk avoidance: human vaccine unavailable at present. LEISHMUNE vaccine is the first licensed vaccine against canine visceral leishmaniasis caused by L. donovani in Brazil. Skin collar with deltametrine can be helpful in dogs. Dog travel to and from endemic areas poses a risk of introducing L. infantum to other areas.Geographical distribution: (semi)arid areas \u2013 steppe and savannah in Asia (L. tropica, L. major, L. donovani), Africa (L. tropica, L. aethiopica, L. donovani) and the Mediterranean (L. tropica, L. infantum); forest ecosystems in Central and South America (L. mexicana, L. donovani, L. braziliensis, L. peruviana, L. chagasi). L. major and L. killicki occur in Tunisia. In 1999, an outbreak of canine leishmaniasis caused by L. infantum was reported in New York, and several other outbreaks followed in Foxhound kennels across the USA.

Only these last stages could infect the vector mosquito again, where they transform in micro- and macro-gametes, which form ookinete (zygota) after copulation that penetrates the mosquito midgut and produce oocysts in body cavity; sporozoites then form in the oocysts and migrate into salivary glands.
