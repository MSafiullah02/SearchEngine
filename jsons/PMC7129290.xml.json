Often, recombinant proteins are viewed as unwanted by cells and are subjected to proteolytic degradation, decreasing the level of recombinant protein expression (reviewed in [8]). Several strategies have been developed to protect recombinant proteins from degradation including the use of protease inhibitors [9], secretion into the periplasm [10] or culture medium [11], and generating protective fusions [12]. Fusions between the N-terminus of target proteins and protein tags (Table 1) have been shown to protect the target protein from degradation [13], [14], [15]. Furthermore, fusions with C-terminus [16], dual C- and N-terminal fusions [17], and tandem fusions of multiple copies of the target gene [18] have been shown to afford protection from proteolytic degradation.",

            "text": "Protein expression is a complex process dependent upon mRNA stability and translational efficiency, as well as transcriptional regulation. Enhanced recombinant protein expression is the result of a high mRNA copy number, efficient translational initiation and elongation, stability of the mRNA, and translation enhancers (reviewed in [22]). Many heterologous genes are not translated efficiently due to codon usage bias. Codon bias has been implicated as one of the main reasons for inefficient translation (e.g., malaria parasite genes [23]). Codon bias has been overcome by engineering new strains or cell lines that contain rare tRNAs or by altering the problematic codons to more common prokaryotic codons [24]. Strong and highly regulated promoters from E. coli, yeast, and insect cells are available [14], [25], [26], and as such transcription of the heterologous gene is usually not a rate-limiting factor. It has been observed that many fusion proteins enhance protein expression [14], [15], [27], however, the exact mechanism by which fusion proteins achieve this enhanced expression is unknown. It has been speculated that enhanced expression is the result of the highly conserved structures of these proteins. Attachment of a highly evolved translational frame at the N-terminus of an inefficiently translated protein may help to improve the latter\u2019s efficiency of expression [28].",

When a large quantity of protein is expressed, macromolecular crowding (200\u2013300 mg/ml in the cytoplasm) presents an unfavorable environment for protein folding. Frequently, the result of a high concentration of incorrectly folded recombinant protein is the formation of inclusion bodies [30]. In fact, the level of aggregated protein can increase to the extent that inclusion bodies are observable by light microscopy as round bodies surrounding the cytosol of E. coli\n[31]. While the formation of inclusion bodies does afford protection from proteolytic degradation, and re-folding can recover active proteins from inactive inclusion bodies, the initial expression of correctly folded, soluble recombinant protein is ideal [32].",

Fusion partners (Table 1) have been shown to act as solubility enhancers, although the exact mechanism by which they improve solubility has not been described. It has been hypothesized that these fusions may act as chaperones [36]. The fusion of a stable or conserved structure to an insoluble recombinant protein may serve to stabilize and promote proper folding of the recombinant protein. MBP has been shown to function as a general molecular chaperone in the context of a fusion protein by binding to aggregation-prone folding intermediates of passenger proteins and preventing their self-association [36]. Fusion tags have also been hypothesized to enhance the solubility of the protein target by acting as a nucleus of folding (\u201cmolten globule hypothesis\u201d) [37], [38]. This theory suggests that a fusion tag acts as a nucleation site for the folding of the target protein. Ub, which has a highly hydrophobic core, has been shown to be the fastest folding protein known [39]. Ub\u2019s ancient structure is highly conserved in SUMO, as well as in other ubiquitin-like proteins used as fusions [6]. When fused to Ub or SUMO, otherwise insoluble proteins have been observed to fold properly and be soluble [14], [15].",

These methods include the use of engineered cleavage sites, which are recognized by the proteases and are positioned between the fusion tag and the protein target. Proteases that have been employed to cleave fusion tags include tobacco etch virus (Tev) protease [47], factor Xa, or thrombin protease (reviewed in [46]).

Many structural and therapeutic proteins require a specific N-terminus, other than methionine, for biological activity (e.g., chemokines). All nascent proteins have methionine as their N-terminal residue; some (e.g., precursor proteins, which undergo proteolytic maturation) then undergo post-translational processing and modification, leading to a variety of N-terminal amino acids. Experiments performed by Varshavsky and co-workers [49] in the 1980s demonstrated that the expression of ubiquitin-\u03b2-galactosidase in yeast leads to rapid processing of ubiquitin in the cells. The processing of Ub-X-fusion, where X is any amino acid, was independent of the identity of residue X [19], [49]. It was observed that the in vivo half-life of the resulting protein varied as a function of the N-terminal residue of the protein (residue X). The \u201cN-end rule\u201d proposes that there is a relationship between the identity of a protein\u2019s N-terminal residue and its half-life. For an in depth discussion of the \u201cN-end rule,\u201d please see appropriate publications of Varshavsky and co-workers [19], [49].",

For example, thrombin will cleave the sequence LVPRGS at the arginine residue, resulting in an N-terminal extension of the target protein by two amino acids (GS) [46]. Since many proteins require a specific N-terminus for biological activity, half-life, or structural stability, this characteristic of protease cleavage can have serious effects on the ability to recombinantly produce active protein. Notable exceptions include the intein, SUMO, and Ub fusion systems. The intein fusion system utilizes the inducible self-cleavage activity of engineered protein splicing elements (termed inteins). In the presence of thiols such as DTT, \u03b2-mercaptoethanol or cysteine, the intein undergoes specific self-cleavage which releases the target protein from the tag. When fused directly to the N-terminus of the target protein cleavage results in the production of a target protein without any extra non-native residues attached to its terminus after cleavage [45].",

However, the SUMO proteases and the deubiquitylating enzymes (DUBs) are distinct from other proteases that recognize a peptide sequence, as they recognize the tertiary structure of the SUMO or Ub tag. When the target protein is fused directly to the C-terminus of SUMO or Ub, cleavage will not result in extraneous residues at the N-terminus of the target protein and therefore will yield native-like protein [15], [49]. The DUBs have a major drawback in that complete cleavage of the Ub tag requires a large amount of enzyme (1:10 molar ratio of DUB to target) [50]. The SUMO protease has been reported to be much more robust, requiring only a 1:5000 molar ratio of protease to target [15]. The new generation of SUMO proteases has been shown to be even more catalytically active requiring only 1:100,000 molar ratio of protease to target (Butt et al. unpublished results) (see further discussion below).",

Saccharomyces cerevisiae has only a single SUMO gene, SMT3 which is essential for viability [55], [56]. In contrast, vertebrates have three SUMO genes, SUMO-1, SUMO-2, and SUMO-3. The three human SUMOs are highly homologous, with human SUMO-1 sharing 50% sequence identity with human SUMO-2 and SUMO-3 [56], and human SUMO-2 and SUMO-3 sharing 87% sequence identity with each other [57]. SMT3 shares 47% sequence identity with human SUMO-1. Although overall sequence identity between Ub and SUMO is only 18%, structure determination by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) reveals that the two proteins possess a common three-dimensional structure that is characterized by a tightly packed globular fold with \u03b2-sheets wrapped around one \u03b1-helix [6].",

SUMO is activated in an ATP-dependent step by the formation of a thioester bond with the SUMO activating enzyme E1. Following activation, SUMO is transferred to SUMO E2, or SUMO-conjugating enzyme. Following conjugation to E2, SUMO is transferred to its target protein through the activity of SUMO E3. These modifications can have a variety of cellular consequences. Sumoylation can antagonize the action of ubiquitination by preventing ubiquitin-meditated proteolysis [60]. SUMO conjugation has also been observed to impact higher-order chromatin structure [61], transcriptional regulation [62], DNA repair pathways [63], nuclear transport [64], and signal transduction pathways [65].",

SUMO fusion leads to enhanced expression and solubility (Fig. 2\nA and unpublished results). For example, when MMP13 is expressed without SUMO fusion in E. coli, it is contained primarily in inclusion bodies. However, when MMP13 is expressed as a SUMO fusion, MMP13 was observed primarily in the soluble fraction [15]. The effect that SUMO has on enhancing protein solubility has been explained in part by the structure of SUMO. SUMO has an external hydrophilic surface and inner hydrophobic core, which may exert a detergent-like effect on otherwise insoluble proteins [15]. A hexahistidine SUMO fusion construct has been shown to enhance expression and facilitate purification with Ni\u2013NTA chromatography. Ni\u2013NTA chromatography has been used to purify the fusion from the cellular lysate (Fig. 2B) [15].",

            "text": "As described above, the major disadvantage of fusion protein technology is cleavage of the tag. Commonly used proteases do not cleave all fusions efficiently, accurately and, moreover, can generate extraneous amino acids at the N-terminus of the target protein [75]. SUMO proteases, which are members of the cysteine protease superfamily, are able to overcome these difficulties. SUMO proteases (LifeSensors) are accurate and efficient in cleavage of the SUMO tag and allow for retention of the desired N-terminus. To date, we have cleaved approximately 100 SUMO fusions and never observed erroneous cleavage within the partner protein. Unlike other proteases that recognize a peptide sequence, SUMO proteases recognize the tertiary structure of the SUMO tag and cleavage does not result in an extended the N-terminus in the partner protein. Owing to its unique structure, SUMO protease can accommodate a variety of SUMO fusion partner proteins (Fig. 4). SUMO proteases have been observed to completely cleave a broad range (6\u2013110 kDa) of partner proteins fused to SUMO [15], [74]. In addition, SUMO protease is able to cleave efficiently under a wide range of conditions, including pH, temperature, and ionic strength (Fig. 3\n). Unfortunately, SUMO protease is not able to cleave target proteins which contain an N-terminal proline. SUMO proteases have a constrictive hydrophobic tunnel within the active site, and substrates must pass through this tunnel during cleavage (Fig. 4\n) [76]. It has been hypothesized that the constrictive tunnel is unable to accommodate the structural changes induced by prolines near the cleavage site.",

However, it is relevant to mention that fusion of Ub to under-expressed genes in eukaryotes enhances the level of protein production, even though the Ub tag is cleaved by endogenous DUBs [77]. We have also observed dramatic enhancement of under-expressed proteins in eukaryotes after fusion with SUMO. Similar to Ub, the SUMO tag is cleaved soon after translation (Edavettal and Butt, unpublished). These studies suggest that protein expression enhancing properties of Ub and like proteins (SUMO) are preserved in eukaryotes.",

However, in eukaryotic systems, endogenous SUMO proteases immediately cleave SUMO fusions, making purification using the SUMO tag impossible. A novel fusion system, split SUMO, has been developed to overcome this problem. In the split SUMO system, SUMO is bifurcated into N- and C-terminal halves (NTHS and CTHS) (Fig. 5\nA). Fusion of the CTHS to the N-terminus of a target protein allows enhancement of expression in eukaryotes and, most importantly, the fusion is not recognized by endogenous SUMO proteases; therefore it is not cleaved in vivo and can facilitate purification. CTHS has strong hydrophobic interactions with NTHS, and mixture of NTHS with the CTHS fusion allows for reconstitution of SUMO in vitro. Reconstitution of intact SUMO by non-covalent interactions between the two halves in vitro generates a substrate for SUMO protease, permitting cleavage and purification of the partner protein (Fig. 5B). We have also observed that fusion of a secretory signal to the N-terminus of the SUMO fusion permits enhanced expression and prevents cleavage of the SUMO tag (Edavettal et al., unpublished). We believe that the secretory signal affords protection from the endogenous SUMO proteases because the nascent protein is captured by the endoplasmic reticulum, and secreted into the media, therefore bypassing the protease-rich cytosol.",

Fusion protein technology represents one strategy to achieve these goals. Fusion protein technology allows for the enhanced expression of recombinant, proteins, which are protected from degradation and have improved solubility and simplified purification and detection. The major drawback to most fusion systems is cleavage of the fusion tag, which can result in the generation of non-native N-termini and erroneous cleavage. The SUMO fusion expression system affords the advantages of other fusion technologies, but also the SUMO protease is efficient, accurate, and does not result in the extraneous residues at the N-terminus of the target protein. We are currently developing the second generation of SUMO tags, which have demonstrated added enhanced expression of under-expressed proteins, and the second generation of SUMO proteases, which are even more robust than Ulp1.",

This technology has been used to efficiently express and purify a variety of proteins, including membrane proteins [78]. Another innovative application of the SUMO fusion technology is its use as an immobilization tool for protein arrays. Applications for protein arrays include expression profiling, protein isolation and purification, protein\u2013protein interaction studies, and small molecular drug discovery [79], [80], [81]. SUMO has both flexible N- and C-termini, allowing dynamic processes to occur with relative ease, and the complex can be released from the solid support by the action of SUMO protease, which facilitates the identification and characterization of the partner protein(s). SUMO and other fusion technologies will allow for efficient recombinant expression of proteins, aiding in numerous future discoveries.",
