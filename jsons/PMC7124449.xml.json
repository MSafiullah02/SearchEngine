Friedenstein et al. [1] initially isolated bone marrow (BM)-derived MSCs by their adherence to plastic dishes. MSCs have been isolated from different tissues including adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, synovium, spleen, thymus, blood, lung, fetal blood and amniotic fluid [2]. Several studies using a variety of animal models have shown that MSCs may have a role in the repair and regeneration of injured lung, infarcted myocardium, and damaged bone, tendon and cartilage [3], [4], [5], [6]. Following infusion of in vitro expanded MSCs in the lung, MSCs have been detected as type I and type II alveolar epithelial cells, endothelial cells, fibroblasts, and bronchial epithelial cells [7]. Although not as tested yet, logically lung MSCs would be more efficient in treating lung diseases as compared to BM-MSCs.",

The 1957 Asian H2N2 and 1968 Hong Kong H3N2 pandemics were caused by avian and human influenza virus reassortants [16]. The currently circulating pandemic H1N1 influenza virus is a triple reassortant influenza virus whose genome contains segments from avian, swine and human influenza viruses [17].",

The mechanisms responsible for deterioration of lung function and the loss of capacity for lung repair after AI virus infection are not well understood. In addition to the HPAI H5N1 viruses, human infections with other subtypes of AI virus including H9N2, H5N1, H7N7, H7N3, and H10N7 have also been reported [23]. Thus, AI viruses pose a potential pandemic threat to human population.

The chicken represents an important animal model for studies of evolution, embryology, immunology, oncology, cell biology, virology, and gene regulation, and was the first farm animal with a completely sequenced genome. Rous sarcoma virus, the first tumor virus, and the oncogene (src) were identified in the chicken thus, the chicken serves as a model organism for the study of viruses and cancer. The chicken immune system provided the first indications of the distinctions between T- and B-cells, with the B-cell nomenclature based on the avian bursa of Fabricius [24]. MSCs derived from lungs could be a very valuable source for use in cell therapy applications on the lung. In addition, we have also provided evidence that chicken lung MSCs are susceptible to infection with AI virus and infected MSCs produce proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines, and therefore, may play an important role in the pathogenesis of influenza infection. We also discuss the potential implications of these observations for infection with highly pathogenic influenza viruses.",

However, this is the first report showing the infection of lung MSCs with influenza virus. Additionally, we detected the expression of IL-6 and IL-8 in AI virus-infected lung MSCs. Production of IL-6 and IL-8 was also detected in human BM-MSCs stimulated with poly(I:C) [41], [42]. IL-6 regulates inflammatory responses and hematopoiesis [43], and its overproduction relates to the pathology of autoimmune diseases and tissue remodeling. Conversely, IL-8 is present in the inflammatory milieu during tissue repair [44]. The production of IL-6 and IL-8 thus suggests that infection of lung MSCs with AI virus might affect their differentiation potential and potentiate the inflammatory response as observed in avian and mammalian species following infection with influenza virus [18], [21], [22]. The mechanism responsible for this hyperimmune activation is not known. Based on our findings and other reports on mechanisms of immune regulation by MSCs, we speculate that infection and lysis of MSCs by AI virus might result in local immune dysregulation allowing infiltration and proliferation of inflammatory cells in the infected lung with excessive production of proinflammatory cytokines. Secondly, as MSCs have been shown to induce the production of T regs [13], lysis and/or apoptosis of MSCs by AI virus and excessive proinflammatory cytokine production by immune cells and MSCs may mediate the depletion of T regs, again contributing to the dysregulated immune response in the lung. Future studies will be directed to examine the proportions of T regs in influenza virus-infected MSCs-T-cell co-cultures and the mediators responsible for inducing alterations in the proportions of T regs.",

Oct4, the octomer-binding transcription factor 4, is an important binding transcription factor that regulates the development and differentiation and pluripotency of MSCs [45]. Due to non-availability of cross-reactive Oct4 antibody, we were not able to directly assess infection of lung MSCs with AI virus in virus-infected chicken lung sections. Interestingly, earlier studies [46], [47] showed the susceptibility of Oct4 expressing putative lung stem cells to SARS-corona virus infection in mouse lungs. Additional experiments are needed in chickens and mammalian species to confirm the infection of lung MSCs in vivo and further delineate their roles in regulating the local immune response following infection with AI/influenza virus.",

The death of the lung MSCs and the resulting local immune dysregulation may contribute to lung damage, loss of repair capacity, and respiratory failure. Further characterization of these MSCs in chicken and other mammalian species may help in understanding the pathogenesis of infectious and non-infectious lung diseases and the mechanisms of lung injury repair.",
