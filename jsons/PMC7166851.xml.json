A direct link between newborn microcephaly and pregnant women infection was confirmed in the year 2016.7, 8, 9, 10 Mosquito bites are the main route of spread of ZIKV infections along with sexual intercourse.11, 12 The mild symptomatic ZIKV infection can be easily detected in body fluids like blood urine and saliva.10, 13 Severe neurological diseases and sterility are reported in some patients as the virus targets all cells of the nervous system.14\n",

The active site of NS5 polymerase lies in the palm subdomain (motif C), where two consecutive aspartates (D665 and D666) protrude from a beta\u2010turn structure and are surface accessible.19, 23 Nucleotide inhibitors mimic the native nucleotides in their ability to selectively target the active site of NS5 to be added into the primer RNA strand. Once bound to the protein, nucleotide inhibitors block the polymerization process and cause protein inhibition.24, 25, 26 Guanosine derivatives were studied against HCV polymerase and a candidate, IDX\u2010184, was under the clinical trials phase IIb before this was halted due to a side effect in the year 2013.18 This gave better results compared with the uridine derivative (sofosbuvir), adenine derivative (MK\u20100608), and the wide\u2010range antiviral ribavirin against HCV and human coronaviruses in silico.16, 18\n",
