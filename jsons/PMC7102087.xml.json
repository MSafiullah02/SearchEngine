Although the absorptive capacity of the transplanted bowel has been dealt exhaustively by the current literature, the issue of motility has not been analyzed in depth [1]. Intestinal motility is regulated by a delicate and complex neural enteric system that can be easily damaged, even during technically successful surgery. However, the bowel can react by activating compensatory mechanisms through neurohormonal feedback that helps it regain adequate motility [1]. Some studies have demonstrated that graft motility between meals, although not coordinated with that of the residual native bowel, remains intact. Nevertheless, despite the importance of this motility in preventing bacterial overgrowth, motility after meals regulates intestinal transit and, hence, influences nutrient absorption. A recent study conducted in animal models concluded that, despite complete extrinsic denervation and prolonged ischemia, the enteric nervous system can generate and sustain a coordinated motility after meals [1]. According to the study, the only anomaly that can arise is an accelerated transit due to increased tone (or nonrelaxation) of the transplanted ileal smooth muscle. In various works reported in the literature, intestinal denervation has been associated with accelerated transit, abnormal propulsive contractions, and giant, migrating motor complexes. However, the exact meaning of these associations is unknown. Transit remains accelerated for 2 months after transplantation and gradually decreases. In some cases, accelerated transit can cause malabsorption. However, no data are available concerning a postoperative period longer than 2 months.",

Because of the different bowel lengths in these patients, we concluded that transit time was normal in the first three patients and accelerated in the remaining two. In four patients with skinostomy, exit of markers did not follow a preferred way because it occurred through the stoma and the physiologic transit. Patients who had accelerated transit showed clinical signs of malabsorption and lack of weight increase. Therefore, we agree with results reported in the literature [1] and found that grafts regained motility despite denervation that was performed during surgery. Even in our small group of patients, we identified two cases of accelerated transit of unknown significance, which was responsible for malabsorption.",

The first examination is usually performed 1 to 2 weeks after surgery to analyze graft anatomy and proximal and distal enteric anastomoses and to study motility by analysis of gastric emptying and of tone and kinesis of small bowel loops. In addition, morphologic analysis of intestinal loops is important. The caliber and pattern of the mucosa can be altered in several complications such as acute and chronic rejection and intestinal infections. The traditional radiologic study with contrast agent is potentially useful in early diagnosis of major complications of transplantation such as anastomotic dehiscence, obstructions, fistulas, motility alterations, rejection, and enteric infections [4]. Unless a particular complication is suspected, checkups are repeated on a monthly basis until every clinical and radiologic finding appears normal.",

Intestinal peristalsis can be noticed from the very first checkups, even though the transit time varies from individual to individual more notably than in nontransplanted patients. A certain delay in gastric emptying can be observed, particularly in the first 2 months after transplantation. However, this aspect tends to improve and usually disappears within 6 months. In multivisceral transplants, pyloroplasty usually attenuates gastric atony that might arise in the early postoperative phase. At an early stage, a rather common finding is represented by thickening of mucosal folds, which is visible in the early postoperative months, and which, as reported in the literature, may be related to the presence of a wall edema due to surgery, an ischemic insult to the graft, and lymphatic stasis resulting from interruption of lymphatic drainage [4].",

The development of adhesions is a rather frequent complication because transplanted patients undergo several abdominal surgeries before transplantation. This dramatically increases the risk to develop viscero-visceral and wall-visceral adhesions in the abdomen and pelvic cavity, which are responsible for graft displacement in the abdomen and actual interruptions of transit. In one case of adhesive bands, surgical exploration, other than indicating the presence of several adhesions, showed a retractile mesenteritis that was characterized by marked thickening of the mesenteric root, thickened and conglomerated graft loops, and an ileal loop matted by an adhesive band.

It took about 4 h for the contrast agent to enhance the small bowel loops, which appeared to be of increased caliber, hardly stretchable, markedly hypokinetic and hypotonic, with almost nonexistent mucosal fold pattern. No signs of interruption were evident. The presence of contrast material in the gastric tract was apparent even after a certain period after the examination. However, the radiologic picture appeared completely nonspecific, and we agree with what has been reported in the literature, namely that the diagnosis of rejection is based on histologic analysis, which identifies different degrees of rejection that range from mild changes in intestinal villi with chronic inflammatory infiltrate to the presence of abscesses of the mucosa and extensive mucosal necrosis involving the entire intestinal wall with possible development of diffuse arterial thrombosis of mural arterioles and vasculitic phenomena [6]. In the two cases of rejection in our series, graft removal in one patient disclosed a bowel completely covered by hemorrhagic petechiae and in another demonstrated late-stage necrosis with multiple perforations of the wall, which appeared edematous and thickened.",

PTLD is a serious complication of immunosuppressive therapy in the transplant of solid organs, with an incidence of 2% to 5%. Currently accepted is the role of Epstein-Barr virus in stimulating proliferation of B lymphocytes that are no longer controlled by T-suppressor lymphocytes, which are inhibited by immunosuppressive therapy. Proliferation of B lymphocytes can have a polymorphous appearance, varying from simple hyperplasia to ascertained lymphomatous appearances [8]. Imaging plays a crucial role in the identification, staging, and evaluation of response to therapy. CT is the reference technique in case of thoracic involvement and abdominal involvement. Lymph nodes and parenchyma may be involved. At the thoracic level, lung parenchyma can be extensively involved; at the abdominal level, the liver and gastrointestinal tract are the areas more frequently affected by the disease. Imaging of PTLD is similar to that of lymphoproliferative disorders that develop in other conditions of immunodeficiency, such as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. Both cases are characterized by marked extra lymph nodal involvement (80%). Some investigators have reported a marked tendency of lymphoproliferative disorders to develop in the same anatomic region as the transplanted organ, with involvement of the graft itself [8]. In contrast, some investigators [9] have pointed out that this is true for lung and liver transplants, where there is a prevalent involvement of the thorax and abdomen, but not, e.g., for heart transplant, where thoracic and graft involvements are rare. In our patients, we identified two cases of PTLD. In one case, we observed a prevalent involvement of lymph nodes in the cervical mediastinal area; in the other case, the areas affected were rhinopharyngeal and pulmonary parenchymal. In both cases, the most evident manifestations occurred outside the anatomic region where the graft was located, without any involvement of the graft itself. In addition, in our cases, CT was the reference technique for the detection and evaluation of all affected sites and for the monitoring of the disease over time.",

In recent years, the use of MR has widened significantly thanks to the introduction of sequences with respiratory gating or quick sequences that are performed in apnea to prevent respiratory artifacts. The value of MR imaging in patients with inflammatory intestinal disease or neoplasm of the small bowel has been widely documented [12]. The intrinsic ability to contrast soft tissues, the possibility of multiplanar studies (the coronal plane is the best for the study of small bowel anatomy), the availability of axial images for a panoramic study of extraluminal pathologic conditions, dynamic sequences after intravenous contrast administration for evaluation of vascular axes, and contrast enhancement of the intestinal wall are among the main advantages of MR, not to mention the absence of exposure to ionizing radiations [12, 13]. The existing literature stresses in particular the role of some sequences, such as SSFSPE T2-weighted, breath-hold T2-weighted turbo spin-echo, and SPGR T2-weighted sequences in the coronal plane with and without contrast agent, whose application is long established in the functional and morphologic study of the intestinal wall in Crohn disease [12\u201314].

In some cases, some fluid within the loops improved our study of the wall thickness and stratification. At the level of the sampled loops, which were more stretched and, hence, more visible, wall thickness in all patients was normal, i.e., 2 to 6 mm. Moreover, echographic wall stratification, characterized by five different layers, alternately hyper- and hypoechoic, appeared normal. Color Doppler depicted blood flow, which was adopted as a reference parameter, i.e., resistance index, which was calculated for the mesenteric artery and a peripheral arteriole sampled on the wall of an intestinal loop. In our small group of patients, we observed high variability between resistance indexes. In particular, in one patient, a decrease in resistance index at the level of the wall vessels was apparent without any visible consequence on mesenteric vessels. In that patient, initial signs of rejection had been identified 2 days previously during endoscopic and biopsy controls. Inflammatory intestinal pathologies have been reported to identify a wall hyperemia, which Doppler visualizes as low-resistance flow signals. In addition, a sharp decrease in peripheral resistance was related to an initial hyperemia in one patient. However, the lack of examinations of ascertained rejection prevents us from drawing conclusions. In two other patients, we identified a similarity in the Doppler spectrum between the superior mesenteric artery and wall vessels. However, our sample size was not sufficient to come to a meaningful conclusion.",
