Human ACE2 is confirmed to be the receptor and a gateway for SARS-CoV-2 6 .

A confirmed case with COVID-19 was defined as a positive result to real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assay for nasal and throat swab specimens. All patients had imaging pneumonia. Critically ill COVID-19 was defined as meeting either one of the flowing criteria: 1) Respiratory distress with respiratory rate more than 30 times/min; 2) Oxygen saturation \u226493% in resting state; 3) PaO2/FiO2 \u2264300mmHg(1mmHg=0.133kPa).4) Respiratory failure requires mechanical ventilation; 5) Shock; 6) Combining other organ failures requires ICU monitoring and treatment.
