            "text": "Plasmid for the expression of the mature form of DENV type 3 (strain Philippines/H87/1956) core protein was constructed in a modified pET21b vector that had a stop codon upstream of the His-tag coding sequence. Core protein was expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells and purified by phosphocellulose (PC) column chromatography. In brief, E. coli cells were grown at 37 o C until A 600nm reached 0.35-0.5. Subsequently, IPTG (1 mM) was added to induce protein expression for 3 h. Cells were harvested and disrupted with a microfluidizer in buffer A, which contained 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.9, 1 mM EDTA, and 15% sucrose. Cell lysate was filtered through a 0.45 \u00b5m filter and applied to a PC column pre-equilibrated with buffer B, which contained 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.9, 0.7 M NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, and 5% glycerol. After washing the column with a large volume of buffer B, protein was eluted by 2 M NaCl-buffer B. Alternatively, the column was washed stepwise by 0.7 M NaCl-buffer B containing no urea to 8 M urea and then 8 M urea to no urea with a 1.25 M or 1.5 M increase or decrease in urea concentration at each step before the protein was eluted by the 2 M NaCl-buffer B. Fractions containing core protein were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 \u00b0C. Protein concentration was determined by Bradford assay. The protein was diluted with 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.9, 1 mM EDTA, and 5% glycerol to desired concentration prior to use and used as 10X stock. To control for host proteins that could potentially be present at a very low concentration, the same procedure was performed from E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells containing an empty pET21b vector. For circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy, the protein storage buffer was changed from 2 M NaCl-buffer B to 0.1 M NaCl-buffer B using an Amicon centrifugal device (Millipore) according to manufacture's protocol. The full-length NS5 protein of DENV-2 strain PL046 (DENV NS5) was expressed as a SUMO-fusion protein from E. coli. In brief, the His-tagged SUMO-NS5 fusion protein eluted from a Ni-column was treated with sumo protease. The released NS5 protein was separated from the His-tagged SUMO by Ni-column chromatography. NS5 protein was further purified by PC column chromatography followed by Sephadex G-100 column chromatography to near homogeneity. The helicase domain of the NS3 protein of DENV-2 strain PL046 (DENV NS3H) was expressed and purified as a His-tagged fusion protein as described [14]. NdAg, which contains the N-terminal 88 amino acids of hepatitis delta antigen, was purified by PC column chromatography as described [12].",

These RNAs were synthesized using the MAXIscript in vitro transcription kit (Applied Biosciences) and PCR-amplified DENV cDNA as the template. RNAs were internally labeled by [\u03b1-32 P]-UTP during synthesis. Total cellular RNA was isolated from cultured BHK-21 cells using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen). Yeast tRNA was purchased from Sigma. Concentrations of labeled RNA were calculated from the radioactivity of RNA and the specific radioactivity of [\u03b3-32 P]-ATP or [\u03b1-32 P]-UTP. Concentrations of unlabeled RNA were determined by measuring the absorbance at 260 nm. RNA was denatured at 95 o C for 5 min and cooled to room temperature before use.
