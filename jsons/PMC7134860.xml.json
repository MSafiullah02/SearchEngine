In 37% of published outbreaks, the source is not identified. When the source is identified, it can be traced back to patients (25.7%), medical equipment or devices (11.9%), the environment (11.6%), and the staff (10.9%).2 Interestingly, the most common pathogens identified in outbreaks are Staphylococcus aureus (14.8%), Pseudomonas spp (8.9%), and Klebsiella spp (7.1%), and these organisms are rarely associated with unit closures.2, 3\n",

Verification may require additional laboratory testing or clinical evaluation. It is, also, essential to communicate with the laboratory to save specimens early on in the investigation. These specimens can be used to identify a common source, trace transmission patterns, or reveal that a perceived outbreak was a cluster of unrelated events. Once the diagnosis has been confirmed, and the laboratory has been notified, a line list is created to describe potential cases with regard to person, place, and time. This is used to help focus the investigation. Simultaneously, it is important to determine if the baseline rate of the organism or infection of interest has changed over time, keeping in mind seasonal variation and comparing equivalent seasons. Such assessments must consider and ensure that other factors are not leading to the newly identified increase to accurately ascertain if there is a \u201ctrue\u201d increase in the rate of interest. A change in rates could result from altered surveillance definitions (changes in the numerator) or changes in the patient population sampled (changes in the denominator). As this assessment process is occurring, other cases should be identified, which may involve broadening the numbers and types of patients tested.",

This definition should be broad enough to capture any potential cases that may have been missed on initial evaluation but not too broad to lose specificity in investigating any important epidemiologic links. Case finding should be performed systematically to avoid bias in data collection. Commonly this requires a review of the literature to understand incubation period, transmission dynamics, and common identified sources of a specific organism or syndrome (Table 1\n). Case definitions may need to be revised in the course of an investigation as new information becomes available. To identify cases, multiple data sources are available, including medical records, microbiology reports, operating room notes, respiratory therapy and procedure logs, or pharmacy records. Once case finding has been performed, generating an epidemic curve, which is a spatial presentation of the number of cases over time, aids in understanding transmission patterns. For example, these data may help differentiate a point source versus ongoing transmission and secondary transmission, and can help in assessing the phase of the epidemic.",

Pseudo-infections most commonly present as pseudobacteremias. Pseudobacteremias occur in the setting of contaminated culture media, contaminated antiseptics, contaminated blood culture vials, or inadequate disinfection of the analyzer. Although less common, pseudomeningitis has significant sequelae and has been due to contamination of procedure kits or culture media.

These procedures involve host bone marrow ablation, which results in profound immunosuppression until the autologous (host) or allogeneic (donor) bone marrow engrafts. Engraftment can take several weeks.118 Gram-positive infections (20%\u201330%), gram-negative infections (5%\u201310%), C difficile (5%\u201310%), and respiratory viruses (15%) are the most common causes of infection in the preengraftment period.118 The hospital environment poses significant risks to patients in this vulnerable time period. In addition, transmission from hands of health care personnel, and sources such as creams, mouthwash, sitz baths, and sinks, have been associated with infections in these patients.119\n",
