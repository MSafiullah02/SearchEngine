            "text": "Coronaviruses are enveloped positive-stranded RNA viruses that replicate in the cytoplasm (Lai and Holmes, 2001, Perlman et al., 2008). They have a distinctive set of club-shaped spikes on their envelope, comprised of the viral spike protein (S). The coronavirus S protein is a primary determinant of cell tropism and pathogenesis, being responsible (and apparently sufficient) for receptor binding and fusion (Gallagher and Buchmeier, 2001). Overall, the coronavirus S protein is categorized as a class I fusion protein (Earp et al., 2005) based on the presence of characteristic heptad repeats (Bosch et al., 2003, Chambers et al., 1990, Kliger and Levanon, 2003); as such it shows characteristic features of fusion proteins of influenza virus (HA), retroviruses (Env) and paramyxoviruses (F) for which there is extensive characterization at a structural and biophysical level (Colman and Lawrence, 2003). Many viral fusion proteins are known to be activated following cleavage by host cell proteases (Klenk and Garten, 1994). This has been most extensively documented for orthomyxo- and paramyxoviruses. In the case of high pathogenicity avian influenza strains, mutations in the region of the cleavage site that modify it from a trypsin-like (monobasic) to a furin-like (polybasic) cleavage site allow systemic spread within the host and hence show drastically increased virulence (Klenk et al., 2008). Although coronaviruses do show structural similarities to canonical class I fusion proteins, they appear to have significant differences in regard to the role of proteolytic cleavage for fusion activation (Bosch and Rottier, 2008).",

            "text": "Coronavirus S proteins consist of two principal domains (S1 and S2), with S1 responsible for receptor binding, and S2 mediating membrane fusion. In group 3 coronaviruses (e.g., infectious bronchitis virus; IBV) there is ubiquitous cleavage of the S precursor protein to form the S1 and S2 subunits (Cavanagh et al., 1986), with cleavage apparently carried out by furin. In group 2 viruses (e.g., for mouse hepatitis virus; MHV), S1/S2 cleavage is variable (Frana et al., 1985). The ability to be cleaved at the S1/S2 boundary has been studied quite extensively for MHV-1 and 4 (Wentworth and Holmes, 2007). While there is some correlation between S1/S2 cleavage and increased cell\u2013cell fusion, in general there appears to be no direct link between syncytia formation (and by analogy S1/S2 protein cleavage) and pathogenicity (Hingley et al., 2002). For the group 2 MHV-2, the S protein remains uncleaved in the virus particle (Qiu et al., 2006). For group 1 viruses (e.g., human coronavirus NL63 and feline coronavirus; FCoV), S1/S2 cleavage is not considered to occur (Vennema et al., 1990), however, recent identification of a group 1 coronavirus with a furin-like motif at S1/S2 (Pratelli et al., 2003) suggests this may not be the case with all group 1 members. Infection of cells by several coronaviruses has been shown to be sensitive to the presence of lysosomotropic agents, such as NH4Cl, which raise the pH of the endosome (Blau and Holmes, 2001, Gallagher et al., 1991, Hansen et al., 1998, Li and Cavanagh, 1990, Li and Cavanagh, 1992, Mizzen et al., 1985). These data suggest a pH-dependent route of coronavirus entry through endosomes. In some cases (e.g., IBV and MHV-4), the coronavirus fusion reaction has been clearly shown to be triggered by low pH (Chu et al., 2006, Eifart et al., 2007), whereas in other cases, e.g., SARS-CoV, it is suggested that the low pH of the endosome is important for activation of cathepsin proteases that prime the fusion event (Simmons et al., 2005), with fusion activation itself considered to be pH-independent.",

While a role for cathepsins during entry of the non-enveloped reoviruses has been known for some time (Ebert et al., 2002, Golden et al., 2004), it has recently become apparent that the fusion proteins from several families of enveloped viruses can be cleaved by these proteases. Such examples are the recently identified paramyxoviruses Hendra and Nipah (Diederich et al., 2005, Pager et al., 2006, Pager and Dutch, 2005), as well as Ebola virus (Chandran et al., 2005, Sanchez, 2007, Schornberg et al., 2006) and Moloney murine leukemia virus (Kumar et al., 2007). In the case of coronaviruses, SARS-CoV and MHV-2 are thought to require cathepsin activation (Huang et al., 2005, Qiu et al., 2006, Simmons et al., 2004, Simmons et al., 2005), with cathepsin L predominantly involved in SARS-CoV entry, and cathepsin B mediating MHV-2 cleavage during virus entry. For SARS-CoV, neither the site of cathepsin L-mediated proteolysis nor the cleaved products produced are known, although for MHV-2 cathepsin B may cleave at the S1/S2 junction (Qiu et al., 2006). Other coronaviruses such as MHV-4, HCoV-NL63 and IBV are not considered to be dependent on cathepsins (Chu et al., 2006, Huang et al., 2005, Qiu et al., 2006).",

            "text": "Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is a highly lethal systemic infection of cats caused by a group I feline coronavirus (FCoV) of the FIPV biotype (Haijema et al., 2007, Olsen, 1993). However, under normal circumstances FCoVs cause only mild and often inapparent enteritis; in this case the virus is classified as the feline enteric coronavirus (FECV) biotype (de Groot-Mijnes et al., 2005, Haijema et al., 2007). FCoVs can exist as either serotype I, or less commonly as serotype II, in which case the spike protein share extensive similarity with canine coronavirus (CCoV) and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV). Due to the relative ease of growth in cell culture, the serotype II FCoVs have been subject to some degree of molecular characterization. In particular, two strains of serotype II FCoV, WSU 79-1683 and WSU 79-1146, have served as model viruses that cause either mild enteritis or FIP, respectively (Pedersen et al., 1984a, Pedersen et al., 1984b). The viruses are thus referred to as FECV-1683 and FIPV-1146. In the \u201cinternal mutation\u201d model of FIP it is believed that a process of mutation within an individual cat confers the ability of a FECV to infect macrophages and monocytes, and so allow systemic spread and become a virus that causes FIP (Vennema et al., 1998). Despite extensive study, the genomic differences that determine whether an FCoV will behave as an FECV or an FIPV are still largely unknown (Haijema et al., 2007). However, in the case of the serotype II FCoVs, mapping studies between the FECV-1683 and FIPV-1146 spike proteins have determined critical domains involved in the switch to FIPV. Surprisingly, the S1 domain (receptor-binding) domain is not important, and the critical region was mapped to the C-terminal part of the S2 (fusion) domain (Rottier et al., 2005).",

Cells were fixed 6 h post-infection, and infected cells were detected by immunofluorescence microscopy using the anti-FCoV nucleocapsid monoclonal antibody 17B7.1, and quantified (Fig. 2\n). Pre-incubation with the specific cathepsin B inhibitor almost completely blocked infection by FIPV-1146, however, treatment after entry had no effect (Fig. 2). Consistent with data from viral growth assays, the cathepsin L inhibitor had no effect on FIPV-1146 entry, except for some limited effect at the highest concentration tested (Fig. 2B). Pre-incubation with either cathepsin B or cathepsin L inhibitor both potently blocked infection by FECV-1683, and again treatment after entry with either inhibitor had no effect. As a control, cells were treated with inhibitors and infected with influenza virus. Infected cells were fixed 6 h post-infection and detected by immunofluorescence microscopy with the anti-influenza nucleoprotein monoclonal antibody H19 (Fig. 2). Neither the cathepsin B nor the cathepsin L inhibitor had an effect on influenza virus entry. Pre-treatment with the cathepsin K inhibitor had no effect on the cellular entry of either FIPV-1146, FECV-1683 or influenza virus (data not shown). These data show that the inhibitory effects of the cathepsin inhibitors are manifested during virus entry.",

Influenza virus is well established to require low pH to trigger its fusion mechanism and was completely inhibited by pre-treatment with 10 mM NH4Cl, analogous to the results obtained with FECV-1683 (Fig. 3). Sendai virus is known to fuse at a neutral pH and accordingly showed no reduction in entry with cell pre-treated with NH4Cl (Fig. 3).",

As shown in Fig. 5\n, cathepsin L was unable to cleave the spike protein of FIPV-1146 under the conditions tested, but was clearly able to cleave the FECV-1683 spike protein, with an obvious cleavage product of approximately 150\u2013160 kDa. In contrast, cathepsin B was able to cleave both FIPV-1146 and FECV-1683 spike proteins, also producing a cleavage product of approximately 150\u2013160 kDa (Fig. 5). The samples shown in Fig. 5 were treated with the endoglycosidase PNGase F, which resulted in a clearer representation of the cleaved product by Western blot, compared to samples without PNGaseF pre-treatment, most likely due to heterogenous glycosylation of the spike protein in samples without the glycosidase (data not shown).

However, the in vivo localization of cathepsins to the endosome/lysosome system, together with absence of any obvious cleaved product in purified extracellular FCoV particles unless exogenous activated cathepsin is added, would strongly suggest that cleavage occurs in the endosome during virus entry. In support of this, we find that addition of cathepsin inhibitors after virus entry has occurred has no detectable effect on viral replication. While the use of feline aminopeptidase N (fAPN) as a receptor for serotype II feline coronaviruses is well established (Tresnan et al., 1996, Tusell et al., 2007, Van Hamme et al., 2007), many other aspects of the entry pathway have not been explored in great detail for these viruses. Based on the effects of lysosomotropic agents shown here, we suggest that all serotype II feline coronaviruses enter the endocytic pathway for virus entry, where they are primed for fusion activation by cathepsin cleavage, but that FECV-1683 is much more dependent on endosomal function, suggesting that FIPV-1146 and FIPV-DF2 may escape into the cytosol earlier in the endocytic pathway. Possibilities that might account for this are the differential cleavage of the FIPV spike protein by cathepsin L, or alternatively a lower threshold for any necessary low pH-dependent conformational changes for FIPV spike. It remains to be determined whether a similar situation with cathepsin cleavage exists for the serotype I FCoVs, which are not considered to share the same receptor as FECV-1683 and FIPV-1146 (Dye et al., 2007).",

However, based on the single 150\u2013160 kDa cleaved product seen in Fig. 5 for both cathepsin B and L, it does appear that the spike protein is subject to single, distinct cleavage event for both proteases, most likely occurring at the same approximate position in S. We used the monoclonal antibody 22G6.4 to show this specific cleavage event, and while the epitope recognized by 22G6.4 is not known, by analogy to the many other S-specific FCoV monoclonal antibodies that have epitopes in S1 (Corapi et al., 1995, Olsen et al., 1993), we tentatively suggest that the 22G6.4-reactive epitope is also most likely to be within the S1 domain. Based on the cleavage pattern shown in Fig. 5., it does not appear that cleavage occurs at the S1/S2 boundary, but rather, the 150\u2013160 kDa cleavage products observed may represent cleavage within the C-terminal part of S2. As the C-terminal part of FCoV S2 has been previously considered to specify the pathogenic properties of FIPV (Rottier et al., 2005), it will be interesting to determine if any of the specific mutations in the FIPV-1146 spike can account for the differential cathepsin-sensitivity observed here.",

This may indicate that the cleavage site is relatively inaccessible, and that only a small number of spike proteins are cleaved during virus entry. In this regard, it is noteworthy that in many cases cleavage activation of a viral fusion protein does not necessarily occur on all copies of the protein; for example see Michalski et al. (2000). Our data also indicate that for FECV-1683 (which is cleaved by both cathepsin B and L), cleavage occurs to a greater degree than with cathepsin B (see Fig. 5). These data are consistent with inhibitor treatments where cathepsin B inhibitor had a greater effect on virus infection than cathepsin L inhibitor. Thus we consider that cathepsin B may be the more important protease mediating FCoV entry, with cathepsin L possibly having a more secondary role.",
