CIRD represents a major welfare issue for kennel facilities, pet owners and veterinarians globally, with outbreaks resulting in delays to re\u2010homing and training and expensive treatment costs. It is characterised by clinical signs such as coughing, nasal discharge and dyspnoea, which can persist for several weeks and may result in severe disease, such as bronchopneumonia, and even, on occasions, lead to death or euthanasia.[1]\n",

Kennelled dogs are particularly at risk of CIRD because of the high population density, and, in re\u2010homing shelters, there is often a constant influx of susceptible animals and pathogens compounding the situation.[4]\n",

Methods for preventing CIRD include both (1) good biosecurity such as quarantine of new and sick animals, and high levels of sanitation and (2) efficacious vaccination.[10] Often however, shelters do not have the space for implementing quarantine procedures, and in busy kennel environments, maintaining high levels of sanitation is challenging. Thus, vaccination is vital in managing this disease, and as such, several mono\u2010 and multivalent vaccines are available (Table 1).",

For live vaccines, many of the inherent properties of the pathogen, which facilitate infection, may help to overcome this. In addition, recent advances in vaccine delivery vehicles are also proving to be promising,[45, 46] but the situation remains far from ideal, and studies continue to be hampered by the inability to accurately deliver or quantitate the amount of delivered antigen. In veterinary medicine, there is the added issue of delivering mucosal vaccines both safely and correctly. Delivering an oral or intranasal vaccine to a defensive, if not aggressive, large dog is not a trivial problem. Delivery of an intranasal vaccine also has the frequent and unpleasant outcome, of being snorted back out immediately after delivery. Therefore subcutaneous vaccination is both surer and safer for the veterinarian. Nevertheless, mucosal immunity is of paramount importance in the prevention of many respiratory agents. Although published data relating to canine vaccine development and efficacy is limited, the increased efficacy of mucosal over parenteral vaccination for Bb and CPIV has been shown (discussed later in this review),[47, 48] furthermore, in the face of MDA, a CAV\u20102 vaccine administered intranasally was also shown to be superior to parenteral vaccination.[49]\n",

This intensive vaccination regime during the first year of life is aimed at overcoming problems surrounding vaccine efficacy due to divergent levels of MDA in individual dogs. In general, dogs responded well to this regime, and numerous experimental studies have shown that antibodies to CDV, CPV and CAV\u20101 & 2 are maintained for three or more years.[50, 51, 52, 53] In the context of CIRD, dogs receiving regular core vaccinations from puppyhood should therefore be adequately protected from CDV and CAV\u20102 infection, two pathogens traditionally associated with canine respiratory disease. However, for those entering kennel facilities where no vaccination history is provided, and a rapid onset of immunity is vital, the WSAVA recommendations are to administer 1 dose of core vaccine before or upon arrival, with a booster 2 weeks later.[42]\n",

Particularly in the re\u2010homing or rescue kennel environment, dogs may be immunocompromised as a result of stress, malnutrition, disease or other underlying conditions. Trying to induce a rapid protective immune response in such animals poses additional challenges and leaves the animal susceptible to infection in the intervening period between booster vaccinations, increasing the demand for quarantine measures.

It is against these two proteins that neutralising antibodies are targeted in convalescent serum.[69, 70, 71] Studies conducted in the 1960s using polyclonal serum revealed few antigenic differences; however, the study was limited to only three canine isolates.[72, 73] In a 1980s study, the use of monoclonal antibodies revealed minor differences in the HN and F proteins, although of the five PIV5 isolates used, only two were derived from dogs.[74] To date, only six complete CPIV genome sequences have been published, and very little additional sequence data for individual viral genes are available, much of which is based on cell culture passaged isolates.[75] In 2014, a study comparing the six CPIV genomes and nine additional PIV5 genomes from different species (six human, one simian and two porcine), revealed a remarkably low\u2010level diversity in the HN and F genes, regardless of host, year of isolation or geographic origin.[75] Interestingly, however, the highest degree of diversity was seen among the canine isolates,[75] and by analogy with human and bovine parainfluenza species, it is possible that the diversity among CPIV strains may be greater than current studies indicate.[76] Nevertheless, the authors suggested that the low level of variation observed was an indication that the virus is either not particularly immunogenic or that cell\u2010mediated immunity is more important.[75]\n",

As the number of novel agents associated with CIRD continue to increase, all with differing characteristics and modes of pathogenicity, the need to comprehensively investigate the role of each agent within the CIRD complex and the host\u2013pathogen interactions taking place become increasingly important to ensure that (1) the appropriate pathogens are targeted for vaccination and (2) vaccines stimulate appropriate and effective immune responses.",

Although this may appear overwhelmingly complicated for future vaccine designs, we are aware from our own research that certain viral pathogens are able to disable the innate immune responses, thereby facilitating other \u2018superinfection\u2019 with bystander agents. In our case, with CIRD, we have proposed that certain viruses, i.e. CRCoV and CnPnV, can allow mycoplasmas and bacteria to penetrate the deeper airways and cause clinical disease. Future vaccine design could be focussed on preventing these early events and thereafter protecting against the opportunist secondary infection.",

The evidence is often that they are effective, but not long lived (months and not years). Possibly, their more immediate effect is by stimulating rapidly the innate immune response and giving some non\u2010specific but rapid protection. A way forward may be through a prime and boost schedule, which utilises both mucosal and parenteral vaccination strategies. Although recent studies in Bb vaccination have shown beneficial effects of this,[80] such regimes require further detailed experimental data. As our understanding of mucosal immune responses increases alongside technologies that support efficacious mucosal vaccine delivery, so do the possibilities for improving CIRD vaccination regimes. Nonetheless, the issue of an intranasal vaccine delivery in aggressive animal species must be considered fully before commercial companies will invest in development programmes.",

Mucosal epithelial cells detect pathogens using pattern recognition receptors and signal to epithelial DCs via cytokines and chemokines. DCs beneath the epithelium extend dendrites between epithelial cells to sample the lumen. In the FAE of the MALT, M\u2010cells transport antigen to DCs residing in M\u2010cell pockets, which present antigens to intraepithelial T and B lymphocytes. Activated DCs migrate to lymphoid follicles or nodes to initiate adaptive immune responses. Plasma cells migrate from the lymphoid follicles and produce IgA, which is transported across the epithelium into the lumen.",
