This allows the cell to recycle nutrients and remove unwanted cytosolic components, such as damaged organelles and intracellular pathogens [1]. In addition to performing housekeeping functions, autophagy is induced by numerous stress stimuli to elicit an appropriate metabolic counter-response and prolong cell survival. Its multiple physiological roles are a likely reason that deficiencies in autophagy are associated with cancers, neurodegenerative diseases, and autoimmune disorders [2], [3].",

As a branch of the immune system, autophagy has both surveillance and effector functions that are important for the detection and clearance of viral pathogens [4], [5]. Autophagy can deliver viral components to endosomal compartments to stimulate innate immune signaling and to provide processed antigens for MHC presentation. Furthermore, the intrinsic capacity of the autophagosome to capture and degrade intracellular pathogens (xenophagy) adds to the antiviral capacity of the autophagosome. Consequently, viruses have developed a variety of ways to suppress and subvert the autophagy machinery for their own benefit. While the role of autophagy in immunity is relatively well understood [6], there is less consensus about how viruses co-opt autophagy for their benefit. Recent research has displayed several proviral subversions of autophagy, although the mechanisms are often unclear. In this review, we will highlight recent work on the antiviral role of autophagy, and how viruses overcome or subvert autophagy.",

Although initially observed in mammalian cells, genetic screens in yeast provided a powerful tool to identify many autophagy-related genes (ATGs), over 30 to date [7]. These ATGs play fundamental roles in the biogenesis of the autophagosome, from its nucleation to its maturation (Fig. 1A). In its classical and most conserved form, autophagy is a response to nutrient starvation, and as such is controlled principally by key regulators and sensors of cellular energy and metabolism [8]. However, much research has shown that autophagy can be induced by signs of cellular damage, such as reactive oxygen species (ROS), ceramides, mitochondrial depolarization, or ER stress, as well as signs of infection, including the activation of innate immune sensors by pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and cytokine production [8].",

In mammals, mTORC1 negatively regulates autophagy under normal conditions through the binding, phosphorylation and consequent inactivation of the pro-autophagy ULK1/2 kinase complex [9]. Under nutrient deprivation, mTORC1 dissociates from the ULK1/2 complex, leading to its activation. Although many of its direct substrates remain unknown, ULK1/2 kinase activity is necessary for the subsequent recruitment of autophagy-related genes to the site of phagophore nucleation [9].",

While selective and bulk autophagy both depend on the same core machinery to nucleate, elongate, and mature the autophagosome; selective autophagy uses special adaptors to facilitate the uptake of marked cargo (Fig. 2\nA). Several selective autophagies have been demonstrated for various organelles, intracellular pathogens, and protein aggregates [18]. In general, the targeting of cargo for selective autophagy depends on the decoration of the target using various autophagy adaptors (p62, NBR1, NDP52, ALFY, Nix etc.) that bind LC3 and the cargo [18], [24]. For several adaptors, such as p62, NBR1, and NDP52, recognition of the cargo is facilitated by the interaction between ubiquitin-binding domains on these adaptors and the specific ubiquitylation of the cargo (Fig. 2A) [25], [26], [27], [28]. However, ubiquitin-independent roles have been suggested for the recognition of some targets by their adaptors [29]. Recognition leads to the specific entrapment of these molecules or organelles in autophagosomes, and the cargo is then delivered to lysosomes for degradation by the canonical pathway.",

Infection with UV-inactivated VSV or VSV-G virus-like particles induced Atg8-I to Atg8-II conversion and formed GFP-Atg8 puncta in infected flies. VSV infection, or incubation with the virus-like particles, led to the down regulation of mTOR activity by inactivation of Akt signaling [30]. The specific signaling events leading to Akt inactivation remain to be determined. However, the authors suggest that either a Drosophila TLR or engagement of a viral receptor may be the trigger [30].",

ER stress is perceived through the unfolded protein response (UPR), a convergence of several cellular pathways that respond to an accumulation of misfolded proteins inside the ER with the concerted goal of expanding the ER to handle the amount of protein inside as well as stopping further proteins from entering the ER [38]. Viral infections often overwhelm the ER with the amount of protein that is being translated and needs to be properly folded. Furthermore, the folding of highly glycosylated (e.g., viral glycoproteins) or hydrophobic proteins places even greater demand on the folding machinery of the ER [38]. Thus, the sheer volume of proteins moving through the ER during viral infections leads to an overload of the ER and subsequent activation of the UPR [39].",

HCV induction of ER stress and the UPR has been suggested to lead to induction of autophagy [33]. Silencing of any of the three UPR signaling molecules decreased LC3-II conversion and HCV replication. However, it has not been shown that HCV-induced ER stress is directly activating autophagy, as opposed to an indirect requirement [33]. Furthermore, transfection of dengue and Modoc virus NS4A, as well as HBV sHB, has been shown to induce autophagy via the UPR. The NS4A protein of Modoc, dengue, and many other flaviviruses, deforms the ER, and while this physical stress on the ER may be sufficient for autophagy induction, it is not clear that this may be the sole (or primary) inducer of autophagy in the context of infection [34]. For instance, in the case of HBV infection, HBV X protein expression was reported to sensitize cells to starvation induced autophagy by up regulating Beclin-1 transcript levels [43]. Subsequent work further reaffirmed a role for HBV-X in autophagy induction, however, the proposed mechanism did not implicate Beclin-1 transcript levels, but rather the interaction with Vps34 and increased PI3K activity [42]. Indeed, neither study has been able to replicate the induction mechanism of previous labs, possibly owing to differences in viral strains and cell types.",

Since many RNA viruses deliver their nucleic acid to the cytosol and/or replicate in the cytosol it is apparent how the cytosolic PRRs are activated by these infections. In the case of the endosomal TLRs, it is less obvious, since the nucleic acid is protected from the endosomal environment by its capsid during endocytosis, or alternatively, entry does not occur through an endosomal compartment for viruses that fuse at the plasma membrane.

In VSV infection, the production of antiviral IFN-\u03b1 by plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) was shown to be dependent upon the autophagic delivery of replication intermediates to TLR7 [46]. By using TLR7\u2212/\u2212 mouse pDCs as well as UV-inactivated VSV, it was shown that IFN-\u03b1 production depended exclusively on active viral replication and recognition of viral intermediates by TLR7. Treatment of infected pDCs with 3-methyladenine (3-MA) or Wortmannin to block Vps34 activity attenuated IFN-\u03b1 production in response to infection, suggesting that autophagy was important for delivery of VSV intermediates to TLR7 endosomes [46].

Moreover, in the absence of virus or poly(I:C), TLR3 could still be found colocalized with LC3 puncta [47].

Herpes simplex virus I (HSV-I) ICP34.5 directs the cellular phosphatase PP1 to dephosphorylate eIF2\u03b1 so that protein translation can proceed [54], [55], [56]. Infection with HSV-1 deleted in the genes encoding ICP34.5 (\u03b3134.5) results in translational arrest and attenuated neurovirulence [57]. It also produces a PKR-dependent autophagy. This induction is dependent on translational arrest induced by PKR\u2019s phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 [50]. Specifically, expression of an eIF2\u03b1 mutant that cannot be phosphorylated by PKR does not lead to the induction of autophagy after infection with \u2206ICP34.5 HSV-1 mutant [50]. Although, the mechanistic link between eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation and autophagy induction is unclear, it is not limited to PKR. The phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 by the ER stress sensor PERK is also important for ER stress induced autophagy [58].",

At early time points of infection, the autophagosomal machinery was dispensable for processing of MHC-I peptides [63]. However, later in infection autophagy was necessary for optimal processing and presentation of HSV-1 antigens on MHC-I molecules. This effect was heightened following infection with a \u03b3134.5 mutant HSV-1 unable to inhibit autophagy. Interestingly, in wild type HSV-1 infection, atypical autophagosomes were described wherein four layered membrane structures that derived from the nuclear envelope accumulated [63]. The nature of these structures is unclear, but they enclose HSV-1 virions, degrade and deliver virion antigens for MHC-I loading, and are dependent upon autophagy induction. It remains unclear how degradation by the autophagosome (or any vacuolar compartment) leads to presentation of antigens on the ER-resident MHC-I molecule [63], [66].",

The EBNA1 protein of Epstein Barr virus is delivered to MHC-II compartments via autophagic uptake and subsequent fusion of the autophagosome with the MHC-II vacuolar compartment [62], [64]. Blocking autophagosomal acidification with chloroquine produced increases in EBNA1 containing autophagosomes, and blocking autophagy by depletion of Atg12 or treatment with 3-MA demonstrated a severe decrease in the ability of these cells to stimulate MHC-II-dependent activation of T-cells [62]. In vivo studies demonstrated the requirement of Atg5 for proper MHC-II antigen presentation of extracellular microbial antigens. DCs from Atg5\u2212/\u2212 mice, unlike their wild type counterparts, were unable to prime a protective antiviral response in Th1 immune cells [65]. Furthermore, basal autophagy is important for the continuous delivery of antigen to MHC-II molecules, suggesting a major role for autophagy in the presentation of MHC-II antigens in vivo during infection [60]. Interestingly, fusing the matrix protein of influenza to LC3 was shown to enhance the MHC-II activation of cytotoxic CD4+ T-cells suggesting this may be a potential vaccine strategy [60].",

In infected neurons of Atg5 deficient or WT mice, no accumulation of ubiquitin was observed in the cells or on the capsid [68]. However, p62 contains several protein\u2013protein interaction domains that may otherwise facilitate ubiquitin-independent interaction [69], [70]. Whether other protein\u2013protein interaction domains within p62 are necessary for the targeting of Sindbis virus capsid remains to be tested. Interestingly, the Drosophila homolog of p62, Ref(2)P, is important for the restriction of sigma virus, and genetic analyses have mapped the relevant domain of Ref(2)P to outside of its ubiquitin-binding domain [71], [72], [73], [74]. While currently unclear, it will be interesting to determine whether the Ref(2)P restriction of sigma virus is autophagy-dependent and the antiviral role of autophagy adaptors is evolutionarily conserved (Fig. 2B). Future work in these systems should provide insight into additional ways that autophagy adaptors recognize cargo.",

Deletion of various autophagy genes led to the increased spread of programmed cell death outside the infected cells, and greater pathology to the plant [75]. In addition to the Ref(2)P restriction of sigma virus, autophagy is essential for Drosophila defense against VSV [30]. Deletion of any of several Drosophila ATGs renders Drosophila exquisitely sensitive to VSV infection and increases the lethality of infection [30].

Upon entry into CD4+ T-cells, HIV-1 Env activates mTOR signaling, shutting down the autophagic response that is initiated upon fusion of HIV-1 into CD4+ T-cells [48]. KHSV also encodes a homolog of the FLICE-like inhibitor protein (v-FLIP) that blocks the interaction of LC3 and Atg3, inhibiting the lipidation of LC3 and subsequent phagophore expansion [80]. Homologous v-FLIPs were found in herpesvirus saimiri and molluscum contagiosum virus that also were capable of blocking autophagy (Fig. 3). In many more viruses, however, the mechanism of blocking autophagy is relatively unclear. For example, HCMV UL83 is capable of blocking mTOR-dependent and mTOR-independent autophagy stimuli through an unknown mechanism [81]. Additionally, both hepatitis B and C viruses have been reported to induce autophagy but then somehow inhibit autophagosome acidification [33], [35], [42]. In the case of SIV-1 infection of glial cells, it has been shown that supernatants from these infected cells are capable of blocking autophagy in surrounding neurons [82]. Such a paracrine suppression of autophagy may have roles in neuronal killing and the associated dementia during SIV-1 and HIV-1 infections [83]. Undoubtedly, as we learn more about the pathways involved in autophagy, we will also find viruses that antagonize these new players.",

Thus, RNA viruses have evolved diverse mechanisms to remodel host cellular membranes to form their replication complexes. The morphology of these replication complexes is distinct between viruses, and in the majority of cases the membrane source remains unclear [84]. For several viruses, the autophagy machinery has been suggested to play a role in the formation of these membrane structures.",

Additionally, these structures \u2013 which are positive for the 2BC protein, among others \u2013 did not co-fractionate with the markers of other known organelles, suggesting that it was possibly a distinct structure from other organelles [85], [86]. The expression of poliovirus 2BC and 3A, which are sufficient to generate membrane structures like those during poliovirus replication, are also sufficient for the lipidation of LC3 as well as formation of autophagy-like DMVs [85], [87]. The accumulation of DMVs in other picornaviruses, such as CVB3, foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV), and enterovirus 71 (EV71) have a similar morphology and are positive for LC3 as well as viral components in vivo and in vitro\n[88], [89], [90].

Initial studies showed that the viral replicase genes colocalized with LC3 and inhibition of autophagy via deletion of Atg5 or 3-MA treatment inhibited viral replication [100]. However, subsequent studies indicated that these requirements may be cell type specific [101]. Furthermore, cryo-EM tomography reconstructions revealed that the DMVs of the coronavirus replication complex were actually a convoluted network of contiguous ER invaginations [103]. Thus, the membrane structures were not distinct autophagosomes. However, the co-localization of LC3 with viral replicase machinery was still observed [102]. It was subsequently shown that LC3-I, but not LC3-II, colocalized with the replication machinery as well as the replication membranes, suggesting a role for the cytosolic form of LC3 and not the autophagosome associated LC3-II [102]. These structures were also positive for markers of the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) response, and remained tethered to the ER. Thus, coronavirus uses components of the autophagy pathway for its replication, but not autophagosomes.",

In HIV-1 infection of macrophages, Gag was shown to co-precipitate and co-fractionate with LC3-II, and this association facilitated the processing of the Gag p24 subunit. Interestingly, confocal and EM studies of gag p17 (a marker of HIV-1 virions) and LC3 showed that the virions and LC3 colocalized in membranous compartments that were juxtaposed to the plasma membrane [78]. Furthermore, these membranes were suggested to be of plasma membrane origin, as clathrin-coated pits were seen forming from them. The authors note these structures are reminiscent of the proposed HIV-1 assembly and budding in macrophages [78]. It has been suggested that the assembly site of HIV-1 is distinct from the endocytic pathway, contiguous with the plasma membrane, and dependent upon the ESCRT machinery [107], [108]. It is possible that HIV-1 uses these autophagosomal structures to enhance the delivery of its virion components to the site of assembly. The ability of Nef to block autophagosome acidification is also essential for release of mature virions [78]. However, it is not clear how acidification affects the Gag-LC3 interaction and how this impacts the immune responses of macrophages to HIV-1.",

While the extent of viral replication inhibition differed between the two studies, both showed that viral RNA is efficiently packaged into the nucleocapsid in the absence of autophagy. However, Li et al. also demonstrated that the efficient envelopment of HBV was associated with autophagy induction [35]. By immunoprecipitating the viral capsid (core) or major envelope protein (sHB) and quantifying the associated viral RNA, the authors showed that significantly less viral nucleic acid is associated with both intracellular and extracellular enveloped particles in autophagy-deficient cells [35]. Furthermore, sHB was shown to immunoprecipitate and co-localize with LC3-I and -II during HBV infection or ectopic expression of sHB, suggesting that this interaction may be important for the acquisition of viral envelope. Currently, the HBV envelope is thought to be acquired post-ER, but pre-Golgi, however the source of this membrane is unknown [109]. The autophagosome may be a potential membrane source or an intermediate compartment HBV uses to traffic through en route to envelopment. Autophagosomes induced by HBV do not mature, as evidenced by a lack of p62 turnover and LAMP co-localization [35], [42]. Whether this occurs through a similar mechanism to HIV-1 is unclear, however for both viruses the lack of acidification could be a result of redirecting autophagosomes along an alternative pathway.",

The inhibition of autophagy via siRNA or drugs leads to a general decrease in infectious virus production, with a more pronounced effect on extracellular infectious virus. Furthermore, electron micrographs captured GFP-LC3+ or VP1+ vesicles budding from and fusing with the plasma membrane to release virions [93]. These images are reminiscent of the first study to suggest a non-lytic release of poliovirus from infected cells [110]. Further evidence from poliovirus suggested that disrupting the microtubule network, either via nocodazole or using a poliovirus mutated in the 3A protein (3A-2), lead to the increased mobility of PV-induced GFP-LC3 puncta and a coincident increase in extracellular infectious virions without increased cell lysis [99]. While it is currently unclear how virions may be escaping via this non-lytic release, several studies suggest a role for autophagy in the secretion of various substrates [111], [112], [113], [114].",

While the effect of autophagy inhibition on viral replication and titer was not explored, apoptosis is a well-known cellular defense response that can restrict viral replication and spread within a host. The mechanistic details remain unclear, however, EM micrographs suggest that B19 infection may induce a selective autophagy that degrades mitochondria (Figs. 2C and 5) [116]. The elimination of mitochondria may provide short-term cell survival and immune evasion, since many pro-apoptotic and immune signals are transmitted through the mitochondria. Although not linked to a potential selective autophagy, infection of immortalized human hepatocytes with HCV suggest that autophagy has anti-apoptotic properties in these cells which may be important for establishing chronic infection in vivo [117].",

This binding prevents the interaction of the RLRs and MAVS, leading to blunted interferon-\u03b2 production by either stimulated or infected cells [130]. While it is unclear whether this mechanism directly is being utilized by HCV, recent work has shown that knocking down autophagy, using siRNAs or pharmacological inhibitors, increases the level of interferon-\u03b2 transcript produced by infected cells [40], [117]. Moreover transfecting HCV-infected cells with HCV and DENV PAMPs, known to stimulate RLR signaling, showed a decrease in interferon-\u03b2 transcript as compared to uninfected controls in an autophagy-dependent manner [40]. Indeed, this did not appear to be a targeted role of autophagy during HCV infection, since the induction of autophagy via rapamycin or starvation led to a similar decrease in interferon-\u03b2 transcript when cells were transfected with HCV and DENV PAMPs [40].",

At the same time, viruses can directly exploit the autophagy machinery to potentially provide membranes for their replication or facilitate the maturation, envelopment, and egress of virions. Furthermore, the modulation of cell fate and metabolism, in addition to the negative regulation of RLR signaling, can enhance viral replication and immune evasion.

Since the lipid droplet is an important site of HCV assembly, one wonders whether HCV may block autophagosomal maturation to prevent the lipid droplet depletion observed in DENV infection. As a result, this could aid in the development of virally induced steatosis.

Investigations into the recognition of virions by the autophagy machinery may open avenues to understanding novel mechanisms of targeting cargo for degradation. Additionally, the examples of DENV and human parvovirus B19 suggest that inducing a selective autophagy can benefit the pathogen by altering cell metabolism and survival, in addition to a possible immune evasion strategy.

The phosphatidylinosital-3-kinase (PI3K) Vps34 forms a complex with Beclin-1 to drive the membrane expansion and fusion events essential to autophagy. Interaction with various Beclin-1 interacting proteins (\u201cregulators\u201d) facilitates the coordination of these events. C. LC3-I is conjugated to phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) to generate LC3-II by a ubiquitin-like conjugation system. Once conjugated, LC3-II inserts into the growing autophagosome and serves as a marker of autophagosomes. LE, late endosome; Ly, lysosome; MVBs, multivesicular bodies; E1, E2, and E3 ligases for the ubiquitin-like conjugation systems; ROS, reactive oxygen species.",

Autophagosomes can be directed to engulf specific cargo through the action of adaptor molecules that bind to the cargo, often by a post-translational modification such as ubiquitination or acetylation, and LC3.

Dengue and human parvovirus B19 induce selective autophagies (of lipid droplets and mitochondria, respectively) that facilitate viral replication through the remodeling of host lipid metabolism (DENV) and the suppression of apoptosis (B19).",
