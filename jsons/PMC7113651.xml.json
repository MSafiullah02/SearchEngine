The clinical signs vary considerably and depend mainly of the age of the pig. Very young pigs are generally more affected by encephalitis, pneumonia and corneal opacity (Stephano et al., 1988). However, recent observations suggest that the virus also affects older pigs, with severe signs including high rates of neurological symptoms in both fattening and adult pigs (S\u00e1nchez-Betancourt et al., 2008), although this has not been experimentally demonstrated. The virus have been characterized and studied at the molecular level (Berg et al., 1991, Berg et al., 1992, Berg et al., 1997, Linn\u00e9 et al., 1992, Reyes-Leyva et al., 1999, Svenda et al., 1997, Sundqvist et al., 1990, Sundqvist et al., 1992), the cellular level (Hjertner et al., 1997, Hjertner et al., 1998, Reyes-Leyva et al., 1997, Wiman et al., 1998) and through experimental infections (Allan et al., 1996, Stephano et al., 1988, Stephano, 2002, Hernandez-Jauregui et al., 2004, Hernandez-Jauregui et al., 2001).",

More recent genetic studies have shown that PoRV-LPMV is more closely related to a virus isolated from bats, the Mapuera virus (Wang et al., 2007). PoRV-LPMV has been classified in the order Mononegavirales, family Paramyxoviridae, subfamily Paramyxovirinae, genus Rubulavirus and species Porcine rubulavirus (ICTV data 2005).",

The F-gene from these two isolates differed at 16 nucleotides, giving four amino acids changes (Berg et al., 1997). In addition to the LPMV/84, the HN-gene has also been sequenced from 10 other isolates originating from 1990 to 2003 (S\u00e1nchez-Betancourt et al., 2008). Over these years only about 71 nucleotide positions differ in the HN-gene, corresponding to about four percent of the nucleotides in the gene. Since this protein probably is the major immunogenic protein of the virus and is prone to antigenic drift, one can assume that the other internal genes are more conserved, although this has not been shown of PoRV.",

The developed assay was tested on various clinical materials, to evaluate its suitability, including representatives of all known variants of the virus.

Where the virus came from and how it was introduced into pigs is unknown. But it was found that PoRV-LPMV is most closely related to Mapuera virus isolated from a fruit bat in Brazil in 1979 (Wang et al., 2007). In addition, in 2004 the presence of antibodies to PoRV from a non-hematophagous bat on the subtropical Pacific coast of Mexico was reported (Salas-Rojas et al., 2004). It is therefore possible that bats introduced the virus to pigs. However, other natural reservoirs are also possible. Until now it has been impossible to study this, since no suitable diagnostic method has been available. To be able to investigate the spread of PoRV-LPMV in nature and in domestic pigs, where the virus now is endemic, a new detection tool is necessary. A real-time RT-PCR assay was therefore developed for PoRV-LPMV, to be able to study these and other aspects of the viral disease.",

For example, the assay has high sensitivity and specificity, and the procedure limits possible cross-contamination. For the assay presented here the P-gene was used since this gene is highly expressed (Hjertner et al., 1998), and because its sequence is available (Berg et al., 1992). As for many other negative stranded RNA viruses, the number of LPMV transcripts diminishes from the three-prime end of the genome. Therefore the genes closest to the three prime end are the logical choice for a sensitive system as possible.",

Interestingly, one of the positive clinical samples was collected from semen. This finding could be an advantage that leads to a broader application of the real time PCR in the swine industry, since PoRV may be transmitted through semen (Solis et al., 2007).

This observation is in agreement with those reported by Wiman et al. (1998). It also shows that this test can be used to study archived material. A small number of infected specimens produced a low fluorescent signal, high Ct value or gave negative results. This was, however, not surprising, as it has been demonstrated by Allan et al.
