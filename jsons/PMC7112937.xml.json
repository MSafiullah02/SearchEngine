After the initial innate response to a viral infection, effector CD8 T cells traffic to the inflamed CNS, playing a critical role in viral clearance through lytic and non-lytic antiviral mechanisms. However, these mechanisms are tightly regulated in the CNS during infection as well as in the resting state to prevent unnecessary autoimmune destruction of this vital, non-regenerative tissue. Furthermore, mechanisms that protect the CNS from immune-mediated damage may ultimately lead to incomplete viral clearance, persistent CNS infection, and chronic disease. Therefore, the generation of appropriate immune responses to infection results in clearance of virus while protecting the function of host tissues.",

            "text": "The neurotropic mouse hepatitis virus, strain JHM (MHV\u2013JHM) is a well-studied pathogen that upsets the balance between viral clearance and regulation of host immune responses in the CNS (Bergmann et al., 2006, Perlman and Dandekar, 2005, Stohlman et al., 1998, Templeton and Perlman, 2007). MHV\u2013JHM is a member of the family coronaviridae, which includes pathogens that are responsible for an array of human diseases ranging in pathogenicity from the relatively innocuous common cold to the more damaging severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Immunocompetent mice infected with an attenuated MHV\u2013JHM variant, J2.2v-1, also develop demyelinating disease (Fleming et al., 1987, Stohlman et al., 1998). Demyelination, a hallmark of the human disease multiple sclerosis (MS), is characterized by dense infiltration of macrophages into areas of white matter of the CNS, in some instances appearing in direct contact with myelin-stripped axons in MS lesions (Trapp et al., 1998) and in the spinal cord of MHV\u2013JHM-infected mice (Templeton et al., in press). It has been hypothesized that, in addition to genetic factors which increase susceptibility, environmental factors such as chronic viral infection may play an important role in the etiology of MS (Hemmer et al., 2002). Studies that examine the pathogenesis of an autoimmune model of MS, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), have largely focused on CD4 T cells as mediators of demyelinating disease. However, increasing evidence suggests that CD8 T cells also play an important role in autoimmune myelin destruction (Brisebois et al., 2006, Huseby et al., 2001). Therefore, CD8 T cells are implicated in both viral clearance and autoimmune destruction of myelin in the CNS.",

            "text": "When immunodeficient RAG1\u2212/\u2212, SCID, or irradiated mice (that lack adaptive immunity) are infected with J2.2v-1, no demyelination develops and mice succumb to severe encephalitis characterized by high levels of infectious virus in the CNS (Wang et al., 1990, Wu and Perlman, 1999). However, transfer of splenocytes from MHV\u2013JHM-immunized B6 mice infected RAG1\u2212/\u2212 mice reconstitutes demyelination (Wu et al., 2000). In this model, development of demyelination is T cell-mediated, as depletion of both populations from the donor splenocyte suspension abrogates disease. Removal of either CD4 or CD8 T cells from the donor population does not abrogate demyelination, although recipient RAG1\u2212/\u2212 mice exhibit distinct clinical courses. Mice receiving CD4 T cells (CD8 depleted) develop more severe encephalitis with little demyelination around 6\u20137 days post-transfer. After receiving CD8 T cell-enriched (CD4 T cell-depleted) splenocytes, infected RAG1\u2212/\u2212 mice develop extensive demyelination, and display only a mild encephalitis when compared to mice receiving CD4 T cell-enriched splenocytes. CD4 and CD8 T cells mediate demyelination by different mechanisms. When CD8 T cell-enriched splenocytes are isolated from an MHV\u2013JHM-immunized IFN-\u03b3\u2212/\u2212 donor, demyelination is significantly reduced when compared to mice receiving wild type CD8 T cell-enriched splenocytes (Pewe et al., 2002; Pewe and Perlman, 2002). Transfer of IFN-\u03b3\u2212/\u2212 CD4 T cell-enriched splenocytes into infected RAG1\u2212/\u2212 mice results in increased demyelination (Pewe et al., 2002).",

            "text": "IFN-\u03b3 is a pleiotropic antiviral cytokine that is critical for CD8 T cell-mediated clearance of MHV\u2013JHM from oligodendrocytes (Parra et al., 1999). In addition to activation of antiviral genes in infected and adjacent uninfected CNS cells, IFN-\u03b3 induces MHC expression and the production of chemokines such as the macrophage chemoattractant CCL2 (MCP-1) (Tran et al., 2000). After recruitment of macrophages by CCL2 and other cytokines/chemokines, IFN-\u03b3 acts to increase both production of nitric oxide and phagocytic function, (Schroder et al., 2004) which increases the demyelinating potential of these cells. In further support of the connection between IFN-\u03b3-production and demyelination, Huseby et al. (2001) demonstrated that antibody blockade of IFN-\u03b3 in a CD8 T cell-mediated EAE resulted in decreased disease. A recent study of a spontaneous model of CD8 T cell-mediated demyelination using mice that constitutively express the T cell costimulatory molecule CD86 in microglia also supports this connection, as IFN-\u03b3R\u2212/\u2212 mice did not develop disease (Brisebois et al., 2006). Collectively, these results show that IFN-\u03b3 is a central component in both CD8 T cell-mediated viral clearance and demyelination. Previous studies have focused on the requirement for IFN-\u03b3, but not on the target of IFN-\u03b3. Herein, we use MHV\u2013JHM-infected RAG1\u2212/\u2212 mice sufficient or deficient in IFN-\u03b3 receptor expression, to determine the target cell for IFN-\u03b3 expressed by CD8 T cells. Unexpectedly, our results showed that enhanced virus replication with subsequent demyelination occurred in the absence of IFN-\u03b3R expression in recipient mice.",

Thus, T cells are necessary for induction of demyelination in J2.2v-1-infected RAG1\u2212/\u2212 mice. However, since demyelination is characterized by dense infiltration of F4/80+ and CD11c+ macrophages/microglia and DCs, it is possible that transferred phagocytic cells play a role in myelin destruction. Therefore, in the absence of an activating factor such as IFN-\u03b3 responsiveness in recipient mice, donor IFN-\u03b3R+ phagocytic cells may be able to compensate in the presence of T cells to mediate demyelinating disease. To rule out the presence of donor F4/80+ and CD11c+ macrophages as a contributing factor in the diseased spinal cord of chronically infected RAG1\u2212/\u2212 mice, we transferred donor splenocytes from MHV\u2013JHM immune mice expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) (Fig. 1\n). At 8 days post-transfer, the spinal cords of infected RAG1\u2212/\u2212 mice exhibited infiltration of GFP+ cells, many of which were positive for the T cell markers CD4 and CD8 (Fig. 1A, B). However, F4/80+ macrophages were uniformly GFP\u2212 (Fig. 1C, D). Furthermore, CD11c+ cells were also GFP\u2212, and were clustered in the spinal cord near GFP+ cells (Fig. 1E, G) or appeared in a circular, perivascular arrangement (Fig. 1). Therefore, F4/80+ and CD11c+ cells in the MHV\u2013J2.2v-1-infected spinal cord were not donor-derived.",

Although macrophages in these spinal cords are recipient-derived (Fig. 1), macrophage and microglia activation may be a consequence of autocrine activation of CD8 T cells by IFN-\u03b3. We examined this possibility by transferring IFN-\u03b3R1\u2212/\u2212 CD8 T cell-enriched (CD4 depleted) splenocytes into J2.2v-1-infected RAG1\u2212/\u2212 mice, and analyzed the amount of demyelination and virus levels in the CNS. Our results showed no significant increase in demyelination in infected recipients of IFN-\u03b3R1\u2212/\u2212 compared to wild type CD8 T cell-enriched splenocytes (Fig. 2A, C, F). In addition, the recruitment of macrophages to areas of demyelination was equivalent in both groups (Fig. 2D, G), and the ability of recipient mice to clear virus from the CNS was not significantly altered (Fig. 2B, E, H). Thus, donor IFN-\u03b3 responsiveness does not significantly contribute to CD8 T cell-mediated demyelination or viral clearance.",

In IFN-\u03b3R1 deficient recipients, however, the decrease in CD8 T cell-mediated demyelination was diminished. Although donor macrophages and DCs do not traffic to the spinal cord in MHV\u2013J2.2v-1-infected mice (Fig. 1), IFN-\u03b3R1+ donor cells present in the transferred population may compensate for the lack of IFN-\u03b3 responsiveness of recipient mice, thus increasing demyelination.

Therefore, the ability of antigen-specific T cells to traffic to the CNS, exhibit their effector functions, and survive in situ may be altered in the absence of IFN-\u03b3 responsiveness in recipient cells, thus decreasing both CD8 T cell-mediated macrophage activation and viral clearance. To examine this possibility, we assessed virus-specific CD8 T cell number and function by measuring IFN-\u03b3 production by cells harvested from the infected RAG1\u2212/\u2212 CNS after direct ex vivo stimulation with an MHV\u2013JHM-specific CD8 T cell peptide. At days 8\u201310 post-transfer, equivalent frequencies (Fig. 6A, B) and total numbers (Fig. 6C) of CD8 T cells were isolated from RAG1\u2212/\u2212 or IFN-\u03b3R1\u2212/\u2212 RAG1\u2212/\u2212 mice, regardless of donor responsiveness to IFN-\u03b3. Furthermore, the number of virus-specific CD8 T cells in pre-transfer splenocyte suspensions were comparable in IFN-\u03b3R1+/+and IFN-\u03b3R1\u2212/\u2212 donors (data not shown), and were consistent with previously published results (Wu et al., 2000). Based on these results, we conclude that decreased demyelination and increased viral titers are not a result of decreased virus-specific CD8 T cell responses in J2.2v-1-infected IFN-\u03b3R1\u2212/\u2212 RAG1\u2212/\u2212 mice.",

Direct recruitment and activation of macrophages/microglia in the spinal cord of MHV\u2013JHM-infected mice are sufficient to induce demyelination in the absence of T or B cells, since myelin destruction is detected in RAG1\u2212/\u2212 mice infected with a recombinant MHV\u2013JHM that expresses the macrophage chemokine CCL2 (MCP-1) (Kim and Perlman, 2005). In wild type mice, IFN-\u03b3-mediated activation and recruitment of macrophages and microglia to sites of viral infection may also occur indirectly through other resident CNS cells. Astrocytes are the resident CNS cell type most likely to facilitate indirect cell recruitment and activation, as CCL2 is produced by astrocytes after IFN-\u03b3 treatment (Hayashi et al., 1995; Weiss et al., 1998).",

This result is consistent with previous studies which demonstrated IFN-\u03b3 and IFN-\u03b3 responsiveness are critical for MHV\u2013JHM clearance from myelin-producing oligodendrocytes of the CNS (Gonzalez et al., 2006, Parra et al., 1999). The observation that IFN-\u03b3R1 deficiency in infected RAG1\u2212/\u2212 recipient mice does not decrease demyelination as extensively as IFN-\u03b3 deficiency in transferred CD8 T cells may be explained by enhanced virus replication in the first group (Pewe and Perlman, 2002). Further, IFN-\u03b3 deficiency is limited to the donor population in CD8 T cell-enriched splenocyte transfers. Other non-T cells present in RAG1-deficient mice are capable of producing IFN-\u03b3, (Schroder et al., 2004) and thus may contribute to viral clearance in the absence of CD8 T cell IFN-\u03b3 production. In IFN-\u03b3R1\u2212/\u2212 RAG1\u2212/\u2212 mice, however, this alternative mechanism is not possible, as the effects of IFN-\u03b3 on any host cell type are eliminated, regardless of the source of IFN-\u03b3. Thus, diminished virus clearance may result in substantial demyelination even in the absence of IFN-\u03b3R1. The primary mechanism for virus clearance from myelin-producing cells is IFN-\u03b3-mediated (Bergmann et al., 2006) and our results suggest that IFN-\u03b3R1 expression in infected recipient mice is likely more critical for CD8 T cell-mediated viral clearance than for CD8 T cell-mediated demyelination.",

Our results demonstrating that recipient IFN-\u03b3R1 expression contributes to demyelination together with the observation of decreased microglial activation and spontaneous demyelination in IFN-\u03b3R1\u2212/\u2212 mice described by Brisebois et al. (2006) suggest that IFN-\u03b3R1 expression by macrophages/microglia is important for maximal CD8 T cell-mediated demyelination. Although a transgenic mouse with macrophage-specific IFN-\u03b3R inhibition has been developed, microglia were not specifically examined in this study, (Dighe et al., 1995).
