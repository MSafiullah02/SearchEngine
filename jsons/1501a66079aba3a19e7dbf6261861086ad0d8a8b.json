We investigated the characteristics of a field strain of PEDV (PEDV strain SH) isolated from a piglet with severe diarrhea on a farm in Shanghai China. Whole genome sequencing and analysis revealed that the SH strain belonged to subtype G2b and has a unique 12-aa deletion (aa 399-410) including the antigenic epitope NEP-1C9 (aa 398-406) of the N protein. PEDV SH strain is highly pathogenic to challenged newborn piglets, resulting in 100 % morbidity and mortality. Pathological examination revealed significant villus atrophy in the jejuna of infected piglets. Mice inoculated with inactivated PEDV SH produced antibodies against the N protein, but no antibodies against the deletions. These results illustrated that deletion of the NEP-1C9 epitope had no effect on the immunogenicity or pathogenicity of PEDV, providing evidence of the necessity to monitor the genetic diversity of the virus.

PED outbreaks have subsequently been reported in Korea, Thailand, and North America, resulting in an increasingly serious threat to the swine industry worldwide. At present, most of the prevalent strains in China are highly pathogenic variants (Lin et al., 2016) . While there are many commercially available PEDV vaccines, they are based on the classical strains CV777, SM98, and DR13, and vaccinated pigs are not well protected from the Chinese highly pathogenic variants infection, regardless of the inoculum strain or type (activated/killed or attenuated) (Wang et al., 2016a, b; Ayudhya et al., 2012) . The differences in genetic component between the current epidemic strains and commercial vaccine strains may be the main reason for this lack of immune protection. Because of the genetic and antigenic diversity of PED isolates, it is necessary to monitor emerging epidemic strains with genomic surveillance programs (Sun et al., 2019) . From a molecular epidemiological survey of PEDV done in our lab in 2016, we found a PEDV strain, from one clinical sample of small intestine, that had a specific continuous 36nt deletion in the N gene. This PEDV strain, originated from a farm in Shanghai, is named PEDV SH. After virus isolation, PEDV SH was plaque purified three times then grown out over 5 generations in Vero cells. The N gene sequence of the purified isolate, after 5 generations, was the same as the parent virus originally isolated from the intestinal tissue. We then commenced characterizing the full genome, pathogenicity, and immunogenicity of the 5th generation of this new strain. The pathological lesions caused by PEDV SH, including severe villi atrophy, are similar to those induced by the highly virulent US strain, PEDV PC22A (Lin et al., 2016) . To understand whether the deletion of the NEP-1C9 epitope impacts SH pathogenicity and immunogenicity, neonatal piglets were infected with the SH strain and mice were inoculated with the inactivated SH. All piglets challenged with SH presented typical symptoms of diarrhea, vomiting, weight loss, and ultimately death at 3-and 4-d.p.i., demonstrating that PEDV SH was highly pathogenic to suckling piglets. To study the effect of the gene deletion on the immunogenicity of PEDV SH, the sera from the mice inoculated with PEDV SH were detected by ELISA. All mice immunized with PEDV SH produced circulating antibodies against N protein to the same extent as mice immunized with PEDV YZ, indicating that the deleted epitope didn't significantly affect the overall immunogenicity of PEDV SH.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 367, "end": 385, "text": "(Lin et al., 2016)", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 683, "end": 706, "text": "(Wang et al., 2016a, b;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 707, "end": 728, "text": "Ayudhya et al., 2012)", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 1047, "end": 1065, "text": "(Sun et al., 2019)", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 1877, "end": 1895, "text": "(Lin et al., 2016)", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "PEDV and TGEV belong to two distinct species of the Alphacoronavirus genus but induce similar clinical symptoms and pathological lesions in newborn piglets.

There are differences between the N proteins of PEDV and TGEV in residues 398-406, although the C terminal of neither the PEDV N protein (aa 302-441) nor the TGEV N protein reacts with anti-NEP-1C9 monoclonal antibody (not shown here). These results remind us that the NEP-1C9 polypeptide may act as a candidate antigen in differential diagnosis assays to distinguish not only the circulating antibodies to PEDV from that to TGEV, but also the conventional strains of PEDV from SH strain. Of course, to fully understand the effect of the NEP-1C9 deletion, the N gene from SH should be cloned to The serum antibody levels in mice inoculated with inactivated PEDV SH, PEDV YZ, or PBS were detected by I-ELISA using polypeptide I and II of NEP-1C9, and recombinant N protein as coating antigens.

This cleavage motif is present in the majority of cell culture-adapted PEDV strains but absent in the emerging field isolates. This protein cleavage is possibly a marker of PEDV adaptation to cell culture. The C-terminal region of the N protein may not be essential for virus replication. Because the PEDV 3Cpro cleavage site is at residue 382 which is in front of the deleted NEP-1C9 epitope, we deduced that the deletion might have no effect on virus replication in vitro. In addition to the unique deletion found in N protein, we noted some amino acid substitutions in N protein of SH strain also occurred in most wild PEDV.

The multiple point mutations at the N-terminal of the PEDV SH S gene result in a decrease in the number of N-glycosylation sites and positional changes, compared with CV777, but the effect of them on the function of the S protein has not been clarified. It has been reported that a 5 % amino acid difference in the S1 protein of infectious bronchitis virus led to poor cross-immune protection (Cavanagh, 2003) . Based on the S gene, PEDV strains are divided into three genotypes: G1 (classical strains), G2 (variant strains) and S-INDEL (recombinant strains). At present, the most prevalent PEDV strains worldwide, especially in China, belong to G2 strains (Lin et al., 2016) .
