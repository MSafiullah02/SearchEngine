Since influenza A virus is capable of naturally infecting numerous animal species, it occasionally causes pandemics and generates greater concern among public health authorities than the influenza B virus, which only affects humans.2, 8, 9 As variation in influenza type A is wide, it is classified into sub-types, based on its HA (hemagglutinin) and NA (neuraminidase) membrane antigens. Antigenic and genetic differences have revealed two lineages of influenza B viruses: Victoria and Yamagata, which have circulated simultaneously around the globe since the 1980s.8, 10 It is difficult to predict which lineage will dominate during the next influenza season.11\n",

Firstly, the children were all recruited from a hospital emergency department, where cases are more likely to be more serious and subjected to supplementary tests, compared with cases seen in primary care settings. Conversely, the availability of the rapid diagnostic test results means that the proportion of children presenting with an isolated fever who are subsequently hospitalized is lower than when this test is not available. It is possible that the symptoms recorded during the follow-up telephone interviews may have been under-reported. Finally, the study took place during a single influenza season, therefore the findings may be an over- or under-estimation of influenza burden in other seasons.

Influenza cases caused by A strains and B strains appear to result in a similar burden in terms of hospitalization and emergency department costs. These could be partially alleviated by appropriate vaccination. The proportion of influenza type A and B during the 2010\u20132011 season was similar and both lineages of influenza type B (Victoria and Yamagata) were detected among cases of laboratory-confirmed influenza in our study, although the percentage of the Yamagata lineage was low. In the influenza season during this study, there was a good match between influenza strains in the vaccine and circulating strains as the vaccine protected against A strains and the Victoria B lineage. In seasons with a mismatch, however, the vaccine is likely to provide less protection. Given the burden of influenza shown in this study, giving children under 15 years of age vaccines containing lineages of both influenza type A and type B might help reduce the overall burden of illness. Due to the difficulty in predicting which virus strains will be responsible for future influenza seasons, the use of tetravalent vaccines, with their protection against both B lineage strains in addition to A strains, may provide the broadest protection.",
