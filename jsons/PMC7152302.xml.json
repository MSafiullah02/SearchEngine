As early as 583, authorities restricted the association of lepers with healthy people, building on the biblical sources in Leviticus.2 In the mid-fourteenth century, authorities isolated victims of plague in their homes with their families until all had died or recovered. These periods of isolation varied in length, but a 40-day period became fairly standard.2\n",

Many states revised public health statutes to codify the necessary procedures. In the first 5 years of the twenty-first century, many states revised statutes concerning emergency powers of the state in the event of terrorist attacks. The revision process has brought issues of civil liberties and the use of police powers to control the intentional introduction of infectious disease into sharp relief.

The goal is voluntary compliance with necessary precautions. Many jurisdictions require a court order to initiate or enforce restrictions of movement or confiscation of property.

A clinician acting in an individual capacity may be requested to provide vaccines or medications to unexposed persons not subject to past or likely future exposure (see Pitfalls section). For example, in the event of a smallpox outbreak, health authorities could decide to immunize whole populations if the resources were sufficient to do so without jeopardizing the protection of those already exposed or infected.

            "text": "Exposed persons and animals without signs or symptoms of infection are subject to quarantine. The nature of quarantine measures is dependent on characteristics of the agent and the outbreak, the cooperation and resources of the persons, the ability to confine or control animals, the capacity of the authority to monitor quarantine, and the level of risk of wider infection. For exposed but not yet infectious persons who can be monitored, confinement is often unnecessary. This strategy is dependent on early detection of infectiousness. The advantage is that individual liberty is only minimally compromised. The disadvantage is that maximum cooperation and significant monitoring is essential to detect \u201cbecoming infectious.\u201d The infectious agent involved is critical because a person may be infectious before symptoms appear or during a nonspecific prodrome. Many state quarantine laws prescribe the use of the least restrictive quarantine measures (Box 68-1\n).BOX 68-1EXAMPLES OF QUARANTINE MEASURES FOR DIFFERENT CIRCUMSTANCES\n\u2022Current evidence indicates that SARS is not spread by asymptomatic persons, but once fever develops, transmission may occur. Healthcare workers caring for SARS patients may be allowed to continue working and moving from home to work as long as fever is monitored at every shift. Persons exposed to SARS may be allowed to continue living in the community on daily fever monitoring with no restriction unless fever appears. Quarantine measures requiring confinement are imposed when fever is detected and remain in effect until the person is determined no longer infectious.\u2022Salmonella can be transmitted by anyone shedding the bacteria in stool. Most people with salmonellosis are advised to use proper hygiene measures to interrupt fecal-oral transmission. Because the interactions of small children increase fecal-oral transmission risks, children may be excluded from daycare settings. Inpatients are subject to enteric precautions to reduce transmission risks in institutions with many vulnerable patients. Because hygiene measures are often not followed, food service, childcare, and healthcare workers with salmonellosis may be excluded from working in food service or with young children or vulnerable patients until two consecutive stool samples collected 24 hours apart test negative for salmonella.\u2022If a bioterrorist or natural outbreak of severe, febrile respiratory disease is suspected, but no source has been identified, any person with fever and lower respiratory tract disease is suspected as a source of exposure until more information is obtained. Hospital emergency departments are required to set up isolation care sites and conduct any such patient directly to those sites for evaluation. Those requiring admission are isolated with respiratory precautions. Those not requiring admission are ordered into home confinement. All personnel in the chain caring for these patients are using personal protection equipment and are monitored on each shift for fever. Visitors and other staff at healthcare facilities are required to have their temperatures taken prior to admittance to the facility to protect patients and staff.\n",

In planning for a response to a smallpox bioterrorism attack, many communities considered what facilities would be needed to house those being monitored and those being isolated and treated.

Some vaccines are effective after initial exposure, either preventing or modifying the disease and influencing the potential for contagion. In the case of smallpox, for example, intensive efforts to identify and vaccinate all contacts were the control measures that led to eradication. If a vaccine is available, persons or animals exposed but without active disease should be immunized. Other control measures, such as fever watch, exclusion from school or work, and/or periodic examinations must continue until a vaccine take is evident or a full incubation period has passed (Box 68-2\n).BOX 68-2EXAMPLES OF VACCINE-RELATED QUARANTINE MEASURES\n\u2022Unimmunized children exposed to measles are excluded from school until one full incubation period after the last case. Children who accept immunization with live virus vaccine within 72 hours of exposure or with immune globulin within 6 days of exposure may return to school. Children immunized outside these timeframes are excluded from school until a full incubation period from the last exposure of that child has passed.\u2022Persons exposed to smallpox without fever or exanthemata may be vaccinated and continue normal activity while being monitored until a vaccine \u201ctake\u201d is ensured (discharge from quarantine) or until fever and/or skin lesions appear (isolation required).\u2022Immunized domestic and farm animals exposed to rabies are revaccinated and confined for observation if owners are willing and able to restrict the animal's contact with other animals and humans until an incubation period has expired. Unimmunized pets have to be quarantined in a controlled facility for 10 days, observed for onset of illness, and if well, vaccinated before being released from quarantine.\n",

If unprotected exposure continues, prophylaxis may need to be extended. Those who refuse or cannot receive prophylactic antibiotics must be placed in strict isolation and monitored closely for 7 days.\u2022Persons with tuberculosis may be required to remain isolated until antibiotics have effectively sterilized the sputum, at which time isolation ceases, but directly observed therapy continues for the full course of treatment.\n",

            "text": "Travel in airplanes, ships, trains, and buses where an infectious agent is thought to have been released or where a person with an infectious disease is identified presents special considerations. In the initial investigation period, groups of people thought to have been exposed to an infectious agent with a short incubation period may be detained for examination. The purpose of the quarantine is to determine whether any others are infected and to initiate surveillance of exposed persons. Attention should be directed toward making a decision about the index case as quickly as possible while the necessary examination of all others is taking place under infection control precautions, reducing both the risk of further exposure among the passengers and the risk of exposing other populations. The responsible jurisdiction may have responsibility for housing, feeding, and treating persons so detained. Although these are often international quarantines conducted by the U.S. government, not all such instances involve international travel (Box 68-4\n).BOX 68-4EXAMPLES OF TRAVEL-RELATED QUARANTINE MEASURES\n\u2022A child on a long airplane trip may develop symptoms suspicious of measles. Data must be collected on the immunization status and current health status of all travelers. Data on the seating arrangements and movements about the plane of the child and other occupants are useful. Immunization can be provided to any unimmunized person. If immunization is unavailable or refused, detailed contact information for the next 3 weeks for any susceptible person is collected, as is precautionary information.\u2022In a more complex scenario, the diagnosis of measles is made after the debarkation and airline manifests must be used to find and notify fellow passengers.\u2022Travelers with suspected SARS provide recent examples. Temperature screening at embarkation and debarkation of travelers from areas with reported cases provide an opportunity to detect cases before passengers are dispersed to many destinations. The quarantine officers need data to decide whether to detain any passengers if there is a suspected case. Data are collected on the body temperature, the current health status, the seating arrangements, and movements about the plane of all travelers. Detailed travel plans and contact information for all nonfebrile travelers for the next 10 days are obtained in some instances. Before release from quarantine, travelers receive \u201cfever watch\u201d instructions and directions to report to medical care if fever develops.\n",

A rapid response may encourage compliance with measures to provide large-scale prophylaxis and reduce panic if it is perceived as equitable and reasonable. The same action may interfere with compliance and increase panic if it is perceived as inequitable or poorly understood.

Issues of compensation for lost wages, care for family members, and similar concerns of persons subject to quarantine cannot be ignored if we are to be successful in meeting the goal. Especially under the pressure of terrorism and demands for action, it is easy to move to coercive measures when appeals to finer instincts would gain much compliance.

After the first cases of deliberate anthrax infections in 2002, many people took envelopes and packages containing white powders to police stations and emergency departments. Many became complacent after a few negative swabs and a few pranks. If one of those had contained anthrax spores, more people could have been exposed and infected.
