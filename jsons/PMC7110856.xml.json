Industrial vaccine development programs (see Table 1\nfor its phases) starts once this proof of concept has been demonstrated and should eventually lead to market authorisation (MA), i.e. the permission to place a vaccine on the market, which is granted by the appropriate veterinary authorities.",

In general, vaccines for production animals are produced in larger quantities at low cost, whereas vaccines for companion animals are produced in lower quantities and sold at higher prices. Moreover, it should be realised that it is difficult for profit-making enterprises to justify the development of vaccines for diseases of low incidence or vaccines for species that are kept in low numbers (Schetters, 1995).",

The Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) requirements, which have been incorporated into law, describe in detail the manufacturing standard. Since the introduction of veterinary medicinal product licensing in Europe some 25 years ago, the economic environment, the increasing legal and regulatory pressure and the changed agricultural scenery have lead to a marked consolidation among the veterinary vaccine manufacturers.",

In recent years, the quest for highly productive cell culture processes has been focused on the front-end to continuous cell-line development rather than the use of primary cells such as chicken embryo fibroblasts (CEF). The improvement in protein expression systems, high throughput screening methods and cell characterisation techniques have enabled the development of more productive and stable cell-lines used for antigen production. Final product quality and consumer safety is already considered at cell-line development, i.e. at the very early stage of a vaccine development project. The development of and transition to animal-component-free culture media for cells, the identification of suitable animal-free replacements for certain components such as bovine serum, and, ultimately, the development of fully chemically defined culture media, are examples of this consideration.",

This offers the opportunity to understand the process at the cellular level and enables better and more predictable extrapolation to large-scale bioreactor processes. The establishment of analytical technologies enabling in-line monitoring of antigen production has the advantage of studying important immunogenic antigen properties such as glycosylation or cell metabolites influencing overall growth of cells and consequently antigen and contributes to the consistency, reliability and scalability of entire processes.",

There is, however, a clear need for improved EHV-1 vaccines, particularly to protect against EHV-1 induced abortion and paresis and also to reduce the incidence and therefore the transmission of EHV-1 and EHV-4 by unweaned passively immune foals (Patel and Heldens, 2005). In this regard, a highly promising experimental EHV-1 vaccine was a temperature-sensitive (ts) strain cloned from a classically mutagenised stock of an abortigenic EHV-1 isolate (Patel et al., 2003a, Patel et al., 2003b, Patel et al., 2004).",

For veterinary vaccine designers, the application and importance of adjuvants has always been evident. Traditional veterinary vaccines, consisting of relatively crude extracts of microbial cultures, are inherently more immunogenic relative to purified subunits or peptide antigens, which are preferred in human vaccines. Obviously, the constitution of the antigen of interest may contribute to immunogenicity and overall level of immune responsiveness.",
