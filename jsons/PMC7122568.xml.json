While most return home healthy, travel acquired illness should be included on the differential diagnosis of the acutely ill child, especially if presenting less than 30 days after returning from abroad. The largest multinational study to date [2] reporting on the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of 1,591 children who were ill after international travel found that the most common syndrome categories were diarrhea (28 %), dermatologic disorders (25 %), systemic febrile illnesses (25 %), and respiratory disorders (11 %) [2]. The group with the highest rate of hospitalization (36 %) was the systemic febrile illness group. Apart from the nonspecific viral illness syndrome, this group included malaria, typhoid fever, and dengue fever \u2013 two thirds of children presenting with these conditions required hospitalization. This finding is in keeping with previous observations that almost all life-threatening infections after travel present with fever [1, 3, 4].",

In children, acute malaria is often mistaken for a viral illness or acute gastroenteritis due to associated nausea, vomiting and diarrhea.

Human malaria is caused by five species of Plasmodium, namely falciparum, ovale, vivax, malariae and the recently characterized species knowlesi (\u201cmonkey malaria\u201d \u2013 malaria of long-tailed and pig-tailed macaque monkeys, found on the island of Borneo and peninsular Malaysia, though it can also infect humans [14]). All of the species of Plasmodium causing malaria in humans are transmitted by mosquito species of the genus Anopheles. Only female mosquitoes bite, and the sporozoites are transmitted to the skin from the saliva of a biting female mosquito, after which they eventually make it into the bloodstream through the network of capillaries in the subcutaneous tissue. After the sporozoites are introduced to the blood through the mosquito bite, they remain in the circulation for approximately 45 min before infecting a hepatocyte [15]. For the next 6\u201315 days, the parasites develop in hepatocytes (the incubation period) (the sporozoites at this stage are known as schizonts) and are then released into the circulation as merozoites, where they infect RBCs. The life cycle of the P. falciparum is shown in Fig. 37.1 [16]. The sporozoites of both P. vivax and P. ovale can become dormant in the hepatocyte in a form referred to as a hypnozoite. The hypnozoite may emerge months to years after initial infection to cause the relapses that characterize infections with these two species [15].\n\n",

Infection caused by P. falciparum, is associated with the worst morbidity and mortality due to the ability to sequester itself in the capillaries and cause major organ dysfunction [17]. Although classically viewed as \u201cbenign\u201d, infections with P.vivax and ovale can have severe clinical manifestations, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), severe anemia, spleen rupture [18], and in chronic untreated infections, severe malnutrition [19].

            "text": "The idea that the characteristic febrile paroxysms of malaria are induced by parasite products released at the time of schizont rupture originated in the nineteenth century [24]. Malaria parasites induce the release of cytokines in a similar way as bacterial endotoxin [15], although they are much less potent. Merozoites contain (and release upon rupture) many glycophosphoinositol moieties that can activate the host inflammatory response in macrophages and dendritic cells via Toll like receptor 2 (TLR2) and to a lesser extent TLR4 as well as scavenger receptors such as CD36 [16, 20\u201322]. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin (IL)-1 and gamma interferon (\u03b3-IFN) are produced and, in turn, induce release of a cascade of other pro-inflammatory cytokines including IL-6, IL-8, IL-12, and IL-18. These are balanced by production of anti-inflammatory cytokines, notably IL-10 [15]. Cytokines are responsible for many of the signs and symptoms of infection, particularly fever and malaise. In addition, cytokines upregulate the endothelial expression of adhesion molecules such as intercellular adhesion molecule 1 through which P. falciparum-infected RBCs promoting cytoadherence, providing a pathogenic link between inflammation and adherence/sequestration. Some investigators have suggested that severe malaria and bacterial septicemia may have a common cytokine-mediated pathology [15, 24, 25]. Several studies have shown a positive correlation between blood cytokine levels and prognosis in severe Falciparum malaria, although the relationship is far from linear. For example, some authors [26] have found that appropriate levels of TNF\u03b1 exhibit anti-parasitic effects, and a high TNF\u03b1 production capacity protects from severe malaria [27].

Infected RBCs have reduced deformability and altered surface characteristics and can be sequestered and destroyed by the spleen. In addition, once the parasites successfully complete the erythrocytic stage of their life-cycle, they replicate, and are released as merozoites with rupture of their host RBCs, leading to intravascular hemolysis [30]. In a recent study [31] from Mali, children with severe malarial anemia and markers of active intravascular hemolysis also demonstrated reduced whole blood levels of nitrite and increased NO consumption relative to controls, which is evidence of NO depletion. It is likely that the mechanism is similar to other hemolytic anemias, where free plasma hemoglobin reacts with NO produced by NO synthases to form biologically inactive nitrate. Because NO plays a critical role in downregulating the expression of adhesion molecules [32] and maintaining blood flow and vascular tone, the catabolism of NO and arginine from intravascular hemolysis in malaria likely promotes inflammation and endothelial activation [33], thus increasing the cytoadherence of abnormal RBCs.",

Parasite antigens are shed during RBC entry, and many of these parasite encoded erythrocyte-adhesive proteins are present at high levels in plasma. They adhere to uninfected erythrocytes and resulting in IgG or complement binding to erythrocytes, leading to their clearance from circulation [34]. As a result of this binding, the direct Coombs test for immunoglobulins and/or complement deposited on the surface of the RBCs is frequently positive. The antibodies giving rise to the positive test are not autoimmune, but rather directed against adsorbed malarial antigens [35]. In addition to destruction of infected and uninfected erythrocytes, decreased erythrocyte production and/or suppression of the erythropoietic response contributes to the severe malarial anemia [34]. Although the cumulative data strongly support that there is imbalance of cytokines in malarial anemia, the cytokine pathways have not been fully characterized.",

Sequestration occurs predominantly in the venules of vital organs, being greatest in the brain, heart, eyes, liver, kidneys, intestines, and adipose tissue [15].

            "text": "The mechanics of cytoadherence involve interaction between parasitized RBCs, endothelial cells, other RBCs, platelets and leukocytes. Parasitized RBCs express an adhesion molecule on their membrane, P. falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP1) [16]. This protein mediates adhesion to various membrane receptors, most importantly CD36 and ICAM 1, but also chondroitin sulphate A (CSA), vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM 1), E selectin, platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1 (PECAM 1), and integrins and selectins [15]. Parasitized red blood cells (pRBCs) and unparasitized RBCs (uRBCs) become less deformable during P. falciparum malaria and, consequently, plug the 3\u20137 \u03bcm-diameter capillaries with stiff RBCs, which have an average diameter of 7.5 \u03bcm [36]. The altered surface membrane of RBCs leads to micro-agglutination of parasitized RBCs as well as clumping of unparasitized RBCs around parasitized RBCs to form micro-thrombi (\u201crosettes\u201d) [36]. A role of complement receptor 1(CR1) in RBC rosette formation has been postulated as individuals with polymorphisms in the CR1 gene, who express low levels of CR1, show greatly reduced rosette formation, and are protected against severe disease [37]. While the mechanisms responsible for cytoadherence and agglutination are well described, their pathologic consequences are less clear. Several mechanisms that might cause damage to host endothelium have been proposed, including mechanical obstruction of blood flow, with vascular leak and subendothelial hemorrhage, activation of endothelium, platelets and leukocytes [38], followed by systemic or local production and deposition of pro-inflammatory cytokines [16] that further upregulate the expression of the adhesion receptors, thus closing the loop between inflammation and sequestration.",

In addition, \u201cexclusion of other causes of encephalopathy\u201d as required in the WHO definition of cerebral malaria may call for investigations that are not routinely available in developing countries. Without a standard diagnostic criterion for cerebral malaria, a useful clinical indicator is the presence of malarial retinopathy, which consists of retinal whitening \u2013 as a consequence of retinal ischemia, vessel changes (whitening, \u201ctramlining\u201d), retinal hemorrhages, and papilledema as seen in Fig. 37.3 [47].

The presence of malarial retinopathy had a positive predictive value of 95 % and a negative predictive value of 90 % for fatal cerebral malaria in comatose parasitemic patients from Malawi [48, 49].

Seizures were often repetitive and prolonged, and 18 children (28 %) had an episode of status epilepticus. Brainstem signs are common and are associated with other features of high intracranial pressure [50].

The underlying causes of severe malarial anemia are multifactorial and involve both direct and indirect destruction of parasitized and non-parasitized erythrocytes, ineffective erythropoiesis, and dyserythropoiesis [34]. Mortality of children with asymptomatic severe malarial anemia is low (around 1 %), but rises to more than 30 % when anemia is complicated by severe respiratory distress and metabolic acidosis [53]. \u201cBlackwater fever\u201d is a rare, but feared complication. A rapid and massive intravascular hemolysis of parasitized and nonparasitized red blood cells results in hemoglobinuria and acute onset anemia and is accompanied by high fever, hepatic involvement, and renal failure. Unfortunately, even with aggressive treatment, this complication is often fatal [23]. Activation of the coagulation cascade and platelets has been widely reported in malaria [39]. Typical disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) with the presence of bleeding is reported in 5\u201310 % of severe malaria cases [23] \u2013 1 % of all cases \u2013 probably less frequently in children.

The etiology of the metabolic acidosis in this case is multifactorial and includes increased lactate production from the parasite, decreased hepatic metabolism [15], recent seizure activity, hypovolemia, cardiac dysfunction and sequestration obstructing the microvasculature causing tissue hypoxia. While the relative contribution of each of these factors is still subject to debate, it is likely that hypovolemia, by causing a volume concentrated and sluggish circulation, acts synergistically with other factors leading to cytoadhesion, increasing the likelihood of microvascular obstruction. In children, respiratory distress (deep breathing, Kussmaul\u2019s respiration, tachypnea) is usually a clinical sign of metabolic acidosis [15]. It can be misinterpreted as cardiac failure and circulatory overload, which rarely occurs in children [55].\n",

In a recent meta-analysis comparing performance of RDTs with the reference standard \u2013 microscopy \u2013 with or without PCR, the average sensitivities of the most commonly used RDTs were 93\u201395 %, while the average specificities where 95\u201398 % [60]. Caution needs to be exercised when translating these performance characteristics from an endemic to a non-endemic area, because the sensitivity of the RDTs decreases sharply when parasite density is below 200/\u03bcl, as may be the case with imported malaria. A positive test is useful, though a negative test should be confirmed by serial microscopy [61]. In the US, there is only one RDT approved by the FDA, Binax Now\u00ae. Its use is unlikely to become widespread, because the manufacturer requires that the laboratory prepare a positive test with known malaria infected blood for quality assurance each time a sample is tested with the RDT and malaria infected blood is not routinely stocked in most laboratories [59]. While potentially useful in the acute setting where an urgent diagnosis is needed, the RDTs cannot be used to monitor response to therapy as the malarial antigens persist up to 3 weeks in spite of successful treatment [61].",

Alternatively, if the infection is a severe case (cerebral malaria or severe malarial anemia), treatment in a closely monitored setting is usually recommended. Additional factors to consider in triaging children towards admission to a closely monitored or ICU setting include evidence of dehydration, inability to take or comply with oral medications requiring parenteral antimalarial treatment, or coexistence of malaria and sickle cell anemia [43]. In holo-endemic areas in particular, with high rates of asymptomatic malarial infections, coexisting or alternative illnesses causing a clinical picture suggestive of severe malarial anemia should be aggressively pursued. The most common differential diagnoses include meningo-encephalitis, pneumonia, infectious or metabolic encephalopathy, other causes of severe anemia, and septic shock. In this epidemiological context, falciparum malaria is a diagnosis of exclusion, in which three negative blood smears at 8\u201312 h intervals are required before the diagnosis can be ruled out. In the meantime, the systemically ill patient is started on empiric parenteral antimalarial therapy as detailed below, in addition to broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy as clinically indicated. The WHO guidelines for therapy and particularly parental treatment options for malaria by severity are listed in Table 37.4 [44, 45].\n",

            "text": "Severe malaria is a medical emergency because the mortality of untreated severe malaria (particularly cerebral malaria) is thought to approach 100 %. Death from severe malaria often occurs within hours of admission, so it is essential that therapeutic concentrations of a highly effective antimalarial are achieved as soon as possible. According to the WHO guidelines, after rapid clinical assessment and a strong suspicion of the diagnosis, full doses of parenteral antimalarial treatment should be started without delay with any effective antimalarial first available [44, 45]. The mainstay of therapy was intravenous quinine or quinidine until the results of a randomized controlled trial comparing standard therapy \u2013 parenteral quinine versus artesunate were published in 2011 [63]. This study recruited 5,425 participants in an open-label randomized trial. Artesunate treatment was shown to significantly reduce the risk of death from severe malaria compared to intravenous quinine: RR 0.76, 95 % CI 0.65\u20130.9. No difference was found in the risk of serious neurological sequelae at day 28. Artesunate therapy was also associated with a lower risk of hypoglycemia compared to quinine. Artesunate also has the advantage of not requiring rate controlled infusion or cardiac monitoring during administration and no need for dose modification in renal failure [23]. Conversely, administration of parenteral quinine is fraught with the potential dangers of cardiac arrhythmias \u2013 cardiac telemetry is mandatory. If the QRS becomes prolonged more than 50 % its baseline value, or QTc > 600 msecs or >25 % baseline, the infusion should be stopped [23]. As mentioned above, quinine can also cause hypoglycemia through direct stimulation of insulin secretion. The loading dose of quinine should not be given if the patient has received quinine, quinidine, or mefloquine during the previous 24 h [44]. Quinidine commonly causes hypotension and concentration-dependent prolongation of ventricular repolarization (QT prolongation). Quinidine is thus considered more toxic than quinine and should only be used if no other effective parenteral drugs are available. Parenteral chloroquine is no longer recommended for the treatment of severe malaria, because of widespread resistance. Intramuscular sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine is also not recommended [44]. Parenteral antimalarials should be administered for a minimum of 24 h, once started (irrespective of the patient\u2019s ability to tolerate oral medication earlier), and, thereafter, a 7 day treatment course should be completed with the enteral combinations listed in Table 37.5 as described by the WHO [44, 45]. Treatment should be monitored closely. Along with clinical improvement, parasite clearance should also be demonstrated by following daily parasite counts. In the first 24\u201336 h of therapy, it is possible for the parasite count to rise and this does not indicate failure of therapy [23]. However if the counts do not start to fall by 48 h and/or do not clear by day 7, resistance to the chosen course of chemotherapy is likely.\n",

Given that most cases of cerebral malaria in children are cared for in severely limited resource settings, there is scarce literature on using advanced therapies such as controlled mechanical ventilation, use of osmolar agents, or intracranial pressure monitoring. In a small study from Kenya [52], mannitol was successful in transiently reducing intracranial pressure but no convincing clinical evidence emerged supporting its use. However patients in this study were not ventilated and they were supported with hypotonic fluids (1/8 saline in Dextrose 4 % solution according to the local protocol), hence the results are difficult to evaluate in reference to the standard management of intracranial hypertension in resource-rich ICUs.",

Standard fluid resuscitation (20 mL/kg aliquots rapid infusion as typically used in pediatric septic shock) resulted in improvement in hemodynamic parameters and clinical condition in small series.

Importantly, 57 % of the patients in this study had severe malaria. The investigators found that bolus fluid resuscitation consisting of 20\u201340 mL/kg of either albumin or saline, as compared with controls \u2013 2\u20134 mL/kg/h maintenance fluids (i.e. no fluid bolus), increased the absolute risk of death at 48 h by 3.3 % and the risk of death, neurologic sequelae, or both at 4 weeks by 4 %. In the subgroup of children with severe malaria, fluid resuscitation increased mortality as well \u2013 OR 1.59 (1.10\u20132.31). The trial included children with malaria, sepsis, pneumonia and meningitis, randomizing all children across treatment arms, even though recommendations for fluid resuscitation are different among these conditions. The authors argue that in sub-Saharan Africa, where resources are very limited, positive diagnosis is not possible at the time of admission to the hospital, and a uniform approach has to be employed for treating severely ill children with very different clinical conditions that present in a similar manner. While the results of this study caution against liberal fluid resuscitation where facilities for advanced diagnostics and monitoring are unavailable, their applicability is probably somewhat limited to those same settings. Conversely, at least for now, in more resource-rich settings, it seems reasonable to identify and treat hypovolemia and/or distributive shock according to the usual Pediatric Advanced Life Support (PALS) guidelines and employ the usual parameters to guide treatment (restoration of peripheral perfusion and urine output, central venous pressure, artificial ventilation as necessary). In children presenting with coma, a more cautious approach to volume expansion should be employed [43], maintaining the fine balance between risk of aggravating cerebral edema and the necessity of an adequate cerebral perfusion pressure.",

Dengue virus is transmitted from human to human by mosquito bites \u2013 the vector is the female Aedes mosquito, which, once infected, remains infective for life (30\u201345 days). Man is the main reservoir of the virus [15]. Viremia in susceptible humans begins between 3 and 6 days after subcutaneous injection, lasts for another 3\u20136 days, and ends as the fever resolves [71, 75]. Dengue can essentially be excluded as the cause of symptoms in a traveler who develops an illness more than 14 days after returning from a tropical or subtropical country [76]. Lifetime immunity follows infection by one serotype, but immunity to the other serotypes is short-lived [15] and is actually involved in the pathogenesis of severe dengue when reinfection with a different serotype occurs (see below). Infectious virus and the virus-encoded non-structural protein 1 (NS1) are present in the blood during the acute (febrile) phase, and high-level early viremia and NS1 antigenemia have been associated with more severe clinical presentations [15, 77, 78].",

The acute onset of hypovolemic shock \u2013 usually due to low plasma volume and less frequently due to hemorrhage \u2013 and the often dramatic clinical recovery with fluid resuscitation, argue in favor of a transient functional increase in plasma vascular permeability that results in plasma leakage [15]. A characteristic feature of severe DHF is that it manifests clinically between days 4 and 6 of the illness, a time when the viremia is in steep decline and the host immune response is well established. The timing of these events suggests the host proinflammatory response, rather than direct virus-mediated effects, mediates the vascular permeability syndrome leading to DSS [80]. However, in spite of extensive research, little is known of the exact mechanisms underlying the change in vascular permeability. The prevailing view is that dengue infection triggers an immunopathogenic cascade that alters microvascular structure or function in some as yet undefined way, resulting in a transient, spontaneously-reversible increase in permeability [81].",

Gene expression studies have shown that blood leukocytes in the early acute phase of dengue relative to the late convalescence phase overexpress genes related to antiviral responses, innate immune responses and inflammatory pathways [80]. Overproduction of cytokines by dengue virus-infected cells or by activated lymphocytes is believed to be critical in pathogenesis [83, 84]. In addition, NS1, the major nonstructural dengue virus protein, which can be either expressed on the surface of infected cells or released in the plasma, is an important trigger for complement activation [79]. Together, complement activation products and cytokines may act synergistically to produce vasoactive and cytotoxic effects by directly targeting the vascular endothelium, resulting in vascular leakage.",

            "text": "There is still controversy as to whether direct infection of endothelial cells with the dengue virus contributes to the pathogenesis of the increased vascular permeability. Infection of endothelial cells by dengue virus has been studied in vitro but has resulted in conflicting findings; the role of endothelial cells in dengue disease pathogenesis remains incompletely understood [87]. A postulated mechanism includes activation and apoptosis of human microvascular endothelial cells, with disruption of the inter-endothelial cell junctions [88]. Other studies have suggested a role for vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) [82] or alterations in \u03b2 integrin expression on the surface of the infected endothelium [89]. Another plausible pathophysiological mechanism for the increased vascular permeability characteristic of severe dengue is a transient disruption in the function of the endothelial gylcocalyx layer [69]. This layer covers the luminal surface of vascular endothelium throughout the body and is composed of a hydrated mesh, rich in carbohydrates and in dynamic equilibrium with plasma constituents. The endothelial glycocalyx has important roles in transduction of shear stress, regulation of leukocyte-endothelial cell interactions, regulation of clotting and complement cascade and it contributes to the permeability of the capillary wall [90]. Supporting the hypothesis of increased systemic permeability due to damaged glycocalyx is the observation that urinary clearance of albumin and other macromolecules is increased in children with active dengue infection [91]. In addition, both the virus itself and dengue non-structural protein (NS1) are known to adhere to heparan sulfate, a key structural element of the glycocalyx [69], and increased urinary heparan sulfate excretion has been detected in children with severe infection [92, 93]9392.",

Self-limited muco-cutaneous hemorrhage is common, while overwhelming hemorrhage occurs less often. When it does occur, it can involve the gastrointestinal tract, skin, heart (pericardium), pleura, lungs or periadrenal tissue [94]. The pathogenesis of hemorrhage includes vascular changes, including capillary fragility (the basis of the tourniquet test), thrombocytopenia \u2013 due to both decreased marrow production and increased consumption, platelet dysfunction and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) [95], the latter usually in the setting of prolonged shock. While all these changes have been noted, they are seldom severe enough to cause the overwhelming hemorrhage that can occur in DHF [96]. An alternative explanation comes from studying the Ebola virus, another arbovirus belonging to the Filoviridae family. Recent work has demonstrated that Ebola virus produces a viral glycoprotein that infects endothelial cells and causes vascular cytotoxicity, leading to entothelial loss and vascular leak and hemorrhage [97]. Some authors speculate that this mechanism may be shared by other arboviruses causing viral hemorrhagic fevers, including dengue [96]. Others are circumspect, given the lack of direct evidence [98, 99].",

Since it is difficult to know which patients will progress onto this critical phase, it is important for the clinician to be aware of warning signs that clinically significant vascular leakage may be developing [69, 72]. Although rare, true hemorrhage can occur, and is more often seen in adult patients [109].",

These mechanisms maintain a \u201cnormal\u201d or even elevated diastolic blood pressure with a narrow pulse pressure (less than 20 mmHg). As opposed to many cases of bacterial septic shock, DSS is reversible and of short duration if timely and adequate volume resuscitation is administered [101].

            "text": "Early in its course, dengue infection is often indistinguishable from other viral syndromes, parasitic infections, or bacterial sepsis. In addition, other conditions leading to a systemic inflammatory response should be considered in the differential diagnosis. Laboratory methods for confirming dengue vary depending on the stage of the illness. In the early stages \u2013 the first 4\u20135 days of illness \u2013 diagnosis relies on detection of the virus, viral nucleic acid or viral antigens (especially non-structural antigen 1 \u2013 NS1) that can be detected within the first 24 h to 5\u20137 days. These are called \u201cdirect\u201d methods and although they provide an early and accurate diagnosis, they are not widely available in resource-limited countries. As the patient progresses into the critical/recovery phases, serology becomes the method of choice [68] \u2013 while serology is widely available, it is also less accurate. The antibody response varies according to the immune status of the host. A first dengue infection in a person who has not been infected with or immunized against another Flavivirus (e.g. yellow fever, Japanese encephalitis, etc.) leads to the appearance of specific IgM antibodies in the serum between day 5 and 10 of illness. These IgM antibodies disappear after 2\u20133 months. Anti-dengue serum IgG becomes detectable at the end of the first week of illness, increasing slowly thereafter, with levels detectable for months and possibly longer. During a secondary dengue infection, or in a person previously infected with or immunized against another Flavivirus, antibody titers rise rapidly but cross-react with many viruses from the Flavivirus group. The predominant antibody type of secondary dengue infection is IgG, which rises as early as day 5 of illness and persists from months to life. Early IgM levels are much lower than in the primary infection and may even be undetectable [69]. Given these intricacies and the variable performance characteristics of commercially available ELISA tests, studies have shown that combining a direct method such as NS1 detection (day 1 to 7\u20139) with a serologic method such as IgM/IgG detection (after day 4\u20135) allows for dengue diagnosis throughout the normal temporal spectrum of patient presentation [112] (Table 37.9).\n",

While the pathophysiology of the two shock states may be different, it is important to note that in western countries mechanical ventilation is easily accessible if patients develop signs and symptoms of fluid overload and respiratory compromise. However in countries where dengue is endemic, respiratory compromise secondary to fluid overload is a major contributor to mortality in settings with poor resources, few personnel, and limited equipment [115]. It is thus incumbent upon critical care physicians to adjust their practice to the appropriate setting and keep parenteral fluid therapy to the minimum required to maintain cardiovascular stability, until plasma leakage ceases [69]. Patients with severe dengue shock, especially if presenting late in the course, should also receive supportive care as clinically indicated, to include renal replacement therapy, use of inotropes and vasopressors, management of liver failure or encephalopathy.",

            "text": "Typhoid bacilli are ingested and then penetrate the intestinal mucosa. In order to produce disease in healthy individuals, the infectious dose has to be large, between 1,000 and one million organisms in volunteers. The infectious dose is decreased in the presence of the capsular Vi antigen, decreased stomach acidity, and food (which protects the bacterium) [121]. Once in the small intestine, the organisms penetrate the mucosa \u2013 likely through the specialized epithelial M cells \u2013 and are taken up by the macrophages resident in the submucosa and travel to the local lymph nodes [122]. In contrast to the non-typhoidal Salmonella serotypes resulting in gastroenteritis, which cause a significant neutrophil influx in the intestinal mucosa and localized infection, the typhoidal Salmonella evade this local defense mechanism. Recent evidence suggests that typhoidal strains evade pattern recognition receptors and induce a less vigorous inflammatory response [123]. A short bacteremic phase ensues, which carries the Salmonella to the reticuloendothelial system of the liver and spleen, where massive multiplication of the organisms occurs. The incubation period lasts 7\u201314 days, followed by a severe secondary bacteremia which marks the onset of clinical illness [122]. During this phase, virtually all organs can be invaded, but of particular importance are the infection of the Peyer\u2019s patches and the gallbladder. The Peyer\u2019s patches become hyperplastic, with superficial necrosis that leads to superficial ovoid ulcers, a hallmark of typhoid fever. Located along the longitudinal axis of the gut, these do not heal with stricture formation, however when such an ulcer erodes into a mural vessel, severe hemorrhage and/or perforation leading to peritonitis can occur [122]. Infection of the gallbladder can result in a chronic, subclinical cholecystitis with persistent fecal carriage.",

Paratyphoid fever has a shorter incubation period and has a similar, sometimes milder clinical course [122]. The classic description of the untreated typhoid fever of average severity is a protracted illness spanning about 4 weeks. The first week is characterized by non-specific, flu-like symptoms, a \u201ccoated\u201d tongue, intermittent or low grade fevers, constipation in adults, diarrhea in children or HIV positive adults [124]. During the second week, the overall condition of the patient declines, with sustained high fevers and a characteristic \u201crelative bradycardia.\u201d Patients appear systemically ill with abdominal distention and splenomegaly. In about 30\u201350 % of cases \u201crose spots\u201d appear \u2013 these are pink, maculopapular lesions, 2\u20134 mm in diameter that develop in crops over the upper abdomen and lower thorax. These are not specific for typhoid, as they may also occur in invasive non-typhoidal salmonellosis and shigellosis [122]. They may be difficult to see in dark skinned individuals and may also be difficult to differentiate from other bacterial or viral exanthems. During the third week, the overall condition of the patient declines further, with continuous sustained high fever, neuropsychiatric manifestations, worsened abdominal distention, and diarrhea. Significant complications occur in about 10\u201315 % of patients and include overwhelming septic shock, myocarditis, intestinal perforation or hemorrhage, and typhoid encephalopathy. Gastro-intestinal bleeding is the most frequent complication and is usually mild, however in about 2 % of cases the bleeding can be life threatening. Intestinal perforation is the most serious complication, occurring in about 2 % of cases and it doesn\u2019t always present with an acute abdomen but rather in a more subtle manner, with worsening abdominal pain, tachycardia and altered mental status. Encephalopathy and shock carry a high mortality [121]. Neuropsychiatric symptoms include apathy, severe agitation, and delirium, although deep coma is unusual. For unclear reasons, the incidence of encephalopathy varies by country, from 10 to 40 % of patients in Indonesia [125] to less than 2 % of patients in Vietnam [126]. Patients who survive into the fourth week start to improve, defervesce, abdominal distention also improves slowly, although the danger of perforation and hemorrhage persists well into the fourth week. Variations from this classic picture are often seen and with the widespread use of antibiotics, the clinical course is much shorter. In fact, community-based studies in areas of endemic disease indicate that many patients, especially children less than 5 years of age, may have a non-specific febrile illness that is not recognized clinically as typhoid [124].",

The clinical diagnosis can be difficult depending on the timing of presentation relative to the natural history of the clinical disease. The gold standard confirmatory test is a blood culture \u2013 however the sensitivity of a blood culture can be as low as 40\u201380 % early in the disease when bacteremia is highest and even lower later in the clinical course [128]. Stool and urine cultures become positive after the first week. However, sensitivity for stool and urine cultures is also low. Bone marrow culture is quite sensitive (55\u201367 %), though bone marrow aspiration is invasive and impractical in many cases. Multiple serologic tests are as widely used as microbiologic culture, but also with problematic performance. The Widal test is the classic test and is based on detecting antibodies to the O and H antigens of S. typhi. Other tests such as the Typhidot or Tubex tests directly detect IgM antibodies to multiple S. typhi antigens. These tests have also underperformed and overall show roughly a 70\u201390 % sensitivity and 70\u201390 % specificity. Despite their limitations they still are used clinically. Nested polymerase chain reaction is exquisitely sensitive and specific and remains promising as the next gold standard for diagnosis where laboratory resources are available. In the end, diagnosis of Typhoid is made largely on a clinical basis. Other common laboratory abnormalities are mild and nonspecific including leukopenia and thrombocytopenia in adults, whereas leukocytosis frequently occurs in children. Hepatic enzymes may also be mildly elevated [128, 129].",

Drug choices should be made based on the severity of illness, geographic resistance patterns, or laboratory sensitivities from clinical isolates. Historically, treatment with amoxicillin or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was the standard of care for many years. Unfortunately, resistance to these agents has become very common. In some areas of China and India 50\u201380 % of isolates are multidrug resistant [119]. Fluoroquinolones have been an excellent alternative supported by multiple clinical trials. Unfortunately in many areas of central and South East Asia, decreased susceptibility to fluoroquinolones is as high as 75\u201380 % in Tajikistan and Vietnam in the late 1990s [119]. Many prospective trials have also demonstrated significant success with azithromycin and ceftriaxone, and treatment with these agents is becoming more widespread. Unfortunately, recently extended-spectrum beta-lactamases have been identified in typhoidal Salmonella serotypes that will greatly limit the therapeutic options for this widespread tropical disease [130]. At this point, for invasive infections fluoroquinolones or third generation cephalosporins are recommended empirically until sensitivities are available [121, 129, 130]. Table 37.10 contains some treatment options for resistant serotypes although in the case of quinolone resistance, multidrug regimens are being studied but data is lacking at this point [128, 131]. Other adjunctive therapy includes dexamethasone has been used as an adjunctive therapy for severe disease characterized by shock and obtundation/coma. Reportedly, the use of dexamethasone reduced mortality in a severe cohort from 35\u201355 to 10 % [125, 132, 133].\n",

            "text": "Leptospirosis is the most widespread zoonosis in the world and it is caused by a spirochete of the genus Leptospira. The annual incidence of leptospirosis in tropical endemic areas is 10\u2013100/100,000 people whereas it is 0.1\u20131/100,000 people in temperate areas [135]. In the end there are more than 500,000 cases of leptospirosis reported per year with an overall mortality rate of 10 % [136]. Although leptospirosis is seen in tropical, subtropical, and temperate climates, it is endemic in much of the tropics, especially in South East Asia. The incidence of the disease is associated with the lack of proper sanitation, poor water quality, flooding, and the presence of maintenance hosts such as rats, dogs, cattle, and swine who excrete leptospira in the urine [137]. Infected rats shed the pathogen for life and most other animals shed for 6\u201312 months, thereby preventing pathogen eradication from the soil and water. In the past two decades the epidemiology of this disease is changing to include more poor urban settings, especially those with high rainfall and flooding. In addition, there have been multiple, limited outbreaks in nonendemic areas such as the USA, Canada, and continental Europe [138]. Many of these outbreaks were related to recreational contact with contaminated natural settings [137, 138]. The disease is contracted via contact with contaminated water or soil, as well as direct contact with infected animal urine. As such, the risk (and incidence) of leptospirosis is increased in many occupations, including farmers, butchers, and veterinarians because of direct contact with hosts. Also, sewer workers, construction workers, flood relief workers, and military personnel are at risk due to indirect contact with contaminated waters. In addition, recreational activities resulting in exposure to contaminated fresh water bodies (lakes, streams, ponds) are at risk for contracting the disease [139]. With increased incidence in endemic areas as well as nonendemic areas, leptospirosis is now considered an emerging global disease [137].",

The pathogen invades the body by contact with skin abrasions, mucous membranes (conjunctiva and nasopharynx), and possibly through intact skin [138, 140]. They invade tissues by adhering to a wide range of extracellular matrix components, endothelial cells, leukocytes, and kidney epithelial cells thereby gaining access to the bloodstream [136, 138]. Once the pathogen has invaded the entry point such as the conjunctiva, there is rapid penetration and dissemination of the organism throughout the body and particularly the kidney [141]. An early finding of diffuse endothelial injury or vasculitis is the main mechanism of tissue damage [142]. Although the exact cause of the vascular inflammation is not yet understood, there are many data showing evidence of small vessel disease in the lung and kidney, as well as the aorta, coronary arteries, and cerebral vessels. Other mechanisms of injury in addition to direct endothelial injury are parenchymal cell injury and increased vascular permeability [142]. Whether the vasculitis demonstrated in leptospirosis is of an autoimmune nature is controversial. Many of the features of common vasculitides such as immune complex deposition have not been shown in leptospirosis, leading some to maintain that the endothelial activation/injury is sepsis-like rather than autoimmune mediated [142, 143].",

This presentation occurs in less than 10 % of leptospirosis patients. The liver is enlarged and tender and the jaundice is due to hepatocellular injury, cholestasis, and increased bilirubin load from tissue hemorrhage reabsorption. A hallmark of this disease is significantly elevated bilirubin out of proportion to the mildly elevated transaminases [138]. Despite this significant liver injury, it is recoverable and as such is rarely the cause of death in this disease. Renal failure can occur in 40\u201360 % with oliguria developing within the first 2 weeks. AKI can occur and can vary from urine sediment changes to anuric renal failure [141]. As stated above, the injury pattern is that of interstitial nephritis. Most develop nonoliguric AKI and those with some preservation of kidney function have better survival. Typically resolution of AKI in adults is near complete by 6 months. In one cohort of 43 children the incidence of AKI was 79 % however only two such children required dialysis and one died. These data show that children with AKI fare much better who also present mostly with nonoliguric AKI with hypokalemia [146].",

There is no apparent relationship between the severity of lung disease and the severity of jaundice and liver injury. The spectrum of pulmonary disease can range from dyspnea, cough, tachypnea, chest pain, hemoptysis to ARDS and massive pulmonary hemorrhage. Recently, a cohort of Weil\u2019s Syndrome patients were described with a 69 % incidence of pulmonary hemorrhage at autopsy and pulmonary hemorrhage is now the leading cause of death from leptospirosis [135, 147]. A typical CXR is characterized by diffuse small opacifications that are disseminiated or coalesce [135]. Although the mortality for Weil\u2019s Syndrome is 10 %, the mortality for leptospirosis associated pulmonary hemorrhage is >50 % [148]. At autopsy, the lung reveals extensive pulmonary hemorrhage from numerous sites, congestion, edema, and hyaline membranes [135]. In children the incidence of Weil\u2019s Syndrome and pulmonary hemorrhage is lower and mortality also is lower compared to adults. In a recent study of 139 pediatric cases the most common symptom was fever, headache, and myalgia. Jaundice was present in 18 % and renal failure in 2 %. Shock was present in 9 % and meningitis in 7 % [149].",

This serology is much more reliable in the second week of illness. The gold standard is the microscopic agglutination test (MAT) showing at least a fourfold rise in titers or a single titer of >1:800 [138, 139, 144].

Disease occurs only as a result of the asexual blood stage after the parasite leaves the liver and begins to invade and grow inside red blood cells (RBCs). All human Plasmodium spp. invade by the same mechanism, but P. falciparum reaches high parasitemia because of greater flexibility in the receptor pathways that it can use to invade all RBCs. RBCs infected with P. falciparum must bind to endothelium or placenta for the parasite to avoid spleen-dependent killing mechanisms, but this binding also leads to much of the pathology (Reprinted from Ref.
