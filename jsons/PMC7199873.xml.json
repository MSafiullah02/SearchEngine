Beyond the standard of care, it recommends that investigational therapies for COVID-19 should only be used in approved, randomized, controlled trials. Whilst the medical profession awaits the results of large scale, well-designed clinical trials that are already ongoing, several smaller studies have emerged with early evidence where adjunctive treatments might improve clinical outcome. Some national professional bodies have put together guidelines on treatment of COVID-19 based on clinical experience, published evidence and/or expert consensus. The objectives of this article are to review the clinical evidences of these investigational treatments used in COVID-19 patients and summarize some of the clinical guidelines on the use of these drugs. The management of concurrent infection, sepsis, shock, haemodynamic compromise, respiratory failure or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) will not be covered as it is considered part of standard care. This article is intended to critically appraise the evidence, rather than endorse the use of these empiric drugs. We hope that it provides some clarity to the treatment options of these patients amidst the trove of information in the literature.",

A concern with chloroquine is its narrow therapeutic window and consequent risk of toxicity. Chloroquine and HCQ have strong tissue tropism for the kidney and liver. At higher cumulative doses, such as with ICU patients who are far more likely to have renal and/or hepatic dysfunction, the risk of cardiotoxicity, prolonged QT interval and arrhythmia is substantially increased [46]. Long term exposure to chloroquine/HCQ carries added risks of retinopathy, maculopathy and cardiomyopathy, therefore short courses of chloroquine are generally recommended by professional bodies when used in COVID-19. The expert consensus on chloroquine by the multicenter collaboration group of the Department of Science and Technology and Health Commission of Guangdong Province recommended monitoring with daily blood counts, electrolytes and cardiac enzymes every other day; electrocardiogram pre-treatment, and 5 and 10 days after starting treatment [47]. Although the American Academy of Ophthalmology does not recommend retinal screening before short-term use of chloroquine [48], patients should be asked about visual changes during treatment. The use of chloroquine with concurrent macrolides (including azithromycin) and quinolone was not recommended in view of risks of prolonged QT interval [47].",

The study halted recruitment of patients into the high dose chloroquine arm after just 6 days into the study when authors noted that more patients in this arm demonstrated prolonged QTc and a trend towards more deaths. Two patients died from ventricular tachycardia. Molina et al. [9] noted in their prospective case series of 11 severe COVID-19 patients that HCQ plus azithromycin, in doses similar to that used in the study by Gautret et al. [4], saw 1 patient discontinue treatment due to prolonged QT interval. Moreover, viral clearance and clinical outcome was not improved by this drug combination. Mah\u00e9vas et al. [10] observed in their cohort of 181 patients with severe COVID-19 that HCQ did not significantly reduce ICU admission, death at day 7 after hospitalization or reduce the incidence of ARDS compared to those who did not receive HCQ. Furthermore, 8 (9.5%) of 84 patients in the HCQ group discontinued HCQ after a media of 4 days due to prolonged QT interval or first-degree atrioventicular block. Perinel et al. [49] attempted to address the issue of HCQ dosing in severe to critically ill COVID-19 patients by studying the pharmacokinetic properties of HCQ in 13 COVID-19 ICU patients. The study population had a median renal function of 79.6 ml/min. Twelve patients were mechanically ventilated, 4 had moderate or severe renal failure, 1 required renal replacement therapy and 1 required extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). On a regimen of oral HCQ 200 mg three times daily, only 8 (61%) patients achieved the minimum therapeutic level of 1 mg/L and 2 (15.4%) patients exceeded the maximum therapeutic level of 2 mg/L. HCQ was withdrawn in 2 (15.4%) patients due to prolonged QT interval. The HCQ blood levels of the patient on ECMO increased more slowly compared to other patients. The authors recommended 800 mg once on the first day to rapidly achieve therapeutic levels, followed by 200 mg twice daily for 7 days in ICU patients.",

At day 7 of treatment, 75% in the combination group tested negative for the virus, compared with 35% in the lopinavir-ritonavir-only group (P < 0\u00b705). Chest CT findings improved for 69% in the combination group compared with 29% patients in the lopinavir-ritonavir-only group (P < 0\u00b705). At day 14, 94% in the combination group tested negative compared to 53% in the lopinavir-ritonavir-only group (P < 0\u00b705). None of the patients developed acute respiratory failure, required invasive ventilation or vasopressor therapy during the treatment. Adverse effects recorded included hyperbilirubinemia (68.7%) and mild gastrointestinal symptoms (43.7%) such as diarrhoea and nausea. The authors concluded that combination therapy might decrease the viral load of COVID-19 and delay progression of lung lesions. Potential confounders included the use of other drugs in patients in both groups (immunoglobulin therapy, corticosteroids, non-specified anti-virals).",

The mortality rate of the cohort was 13%, including 6 of 34 patients on invasive ventilation and 1 of 19 patients on non-invasive oxygen support. Adverse events were reported in 60% of the study population and were generally more common in patients on invasive ventilation. The most common adverse events were increased hepatic enzymes, diarrhea, rash, renal impairment and hypotension. Serious adverse events included multiple- organ-dysfunction syndrome, septic shock, acute kidney injury, and hypotension. Four (8%) patients discontinued remdesivir treatment due to worsening pre-existing renal failure, multiple organ failure, elevated aminotransferases and maculopapular rash. Some limitations of the study were the lack of pre-defined sample size, short duration of follow-up, lack of data on viral load to determine anti-viral effects and lack of control group. Notably, the pharmaceutical company that developed remdesivir was responsible for the funding, study design, approving the patient selection and drafting the manuscript.",

A systemic review of SARS treatment reported 29 studies on corticosteroid use, of which 25 were inconclusive and 4 demonstrated possible harm [58]. A multi-center retrospective cohort study of 309 ICU patients with MERS noted that patients who received corticosteroids were associated with delayed viral clearance and lack of survival benefit [59]. A meta-analysis of patients with seasonal and pandemic influenza from 3 Asian cohorts observed that corticosteroid therapy was associated with superinfection and increased mortality [60].

            "text": "The second issue is the lack of information on potential adverse effects of these investigational drugs in the COVID-19 patient population. Eighteen of the 30 identified studies did not note or report adverse effects. Notwithstanding, this is an inherent issue with clinical studies of small numbers, which may not uncover safety issues especially without control groups. The concern with administering investigational drugs without full awareness of its safety profile is the assumption that drugs given as compassionate use is one step \u201cbetter\u201d than standard care alone. This is simply not true. A prime example is the elderly with cardiovascular co-morbidities, who are a high-risk group for complications and mortality from COVID-19 [8, 74]. The same population is also susceptible to the ill effects of chloroquine/HCQ if not used judiciously. The clinical trial from Brazil that prematurely halted recruitment of patients into the high-dose chloroquine arm just 6 days into the trial due to complications and deaths from cardiotoxicity illustrates this point [46]. When in doubt, the control group is considered safer in terms of risk of harm compared to the investigation group as the control group receives evidence-based care [75].",

Recognizing the need to harmonise research efforts, the WHO is coordinating an international clinical study that focuses efforts on 4 potential treatments for COVID-19, namely lopinavir-ritonavir, lopinavir-ritonavir in combination with interferon \u03b2, remdesivir and chloroquine [76]. The same 4 therapies will also be evaluated in a European clinical trial that aims to recruit 3200 patients from 8 European countries [77]. This trial is designed to be adaptive, such that ineffective investigational treatments can be quickly rejected and replaced with others as research findings unfold, which is ideal in a study performed during an outbreak.",
