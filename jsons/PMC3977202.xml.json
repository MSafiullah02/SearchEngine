            "text": "Asthma, the most common chronic disease of childhood, often presents during the preschool years with wheezing viral respiratory infections. Viral wheezing illnesses during childhood are pervasive, with up to 50% of children having at least one episode of wheezing prior to school age 1. Viral pathogens have been demonstrated in up to 90% of acute wheezing episodes within the first 3 yrs of life 2. Improvements in molecular diagnostic techniques, through the advent of PCR, have enhanced our ability to recognize novel species and types of viruses previously undocumented or underestimated in the wheezing patient (Table 1). While respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) had long been recognized as a cause of lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) in infants, particularly during the winter season, human rhinovirus (HRV) has been detected in more than 60% of asthma exacerbations, making it a common culprit throughout the year 9. The previously difficult to culture HRV\u2010C species has now been identified, with data indicating that this particular virus may be intrinsically more virulent and likely to incite wheezing 10. Parainfluenza, coronavirus, influenza, adenovirus, bocavirus, and human metapneumovirus (hMPV) have also been identified in wheezing children, along with bacteria including non\u2010typeable haemophilus influenza, streptococcus pneumoniae, moraxella catarrhalis, mycoplasma pneumoniae, and chlamydophila pneumoniae 11, 12, 13, 14, 15.",

HRVs are non\u2010enveloped, single\u2010stranded RNA viruses from the Picornaviridae family of viruses. Based upon sequence homology, three distinct species of HRV have been identified: HRV\u2010A, HRV\u2010B, and HRV\u2010C. HRV\u2010A is composed of >70 types and HRV\u2010B with >25 types. More recently, a 3rd distinct group of HRV\u2010C has been identified, with a rapidly expanding number of distinct serotypes. This particular species has proven difficult to grow in traditional culture, making their initial detection elusive. HRV\u2010C has been identified frequently from patients hospitalized for fever, respiratory illness, and asthma exacerbations 10. Children hospitalized with HRV infection tend to be older with a prior history of wheezing, as well as a personal history of atopy 18. The omnipresent nature of HRV infections throughout the year can be further categorized via species analysis. Data have shown peak incidence of HRV\u2010C types in the fall, timing that correlates with increased asthma exacerbations and hospitalization rates and with increased HRV\u2010A detection during the spring 10, 19. There is a relatively low level of HRV\u2010B burden throughout the year 10. The broad spectrum of illness generated by HRV infections, from asymptomatic to severe respiratory compromise necessitating hospitalization, strongly suggests that host factors modify the impact of infection. As such, allergic sensitization and innate immune response patterns to infection are thought to play a vital role 5, 6, 20.",

In a prospective analysis of outcome in relation to asthma, Kotaniemi and colleagues investigated 100 children hospitalized for wheezing during the first 2 yrs of life, performing viral RT\u2010PCR from frozen nasal aspirates obtained from the index episode of wheezing 21. They found that while prior to 6 months of age, RSV was the most commonly isolated viral pathogen, and from 6 months onward, HRV was most prevalent in wheezing children. The risk for asthma development by school age was 4\u00d7 greater in the HRV\u2010infected group than for children hospitalized with other respiratory viral illnesses 21. Kusel et al. demonstrated, in a high\u2010risk birth cohort, an association between outpatient wheezing with HRV in infancy and persistent wheezing at 5 yrs of age, particularly for children with early allergic sensitization 3. The Childhood Origins of ASThma study (COAST), also a high\u2010risk birth cohort, identified HRV\u2010induced wheezing during infancy as the most significant predictor of persistent wheezing at 3 yrs of life and a diagnosis of asthma at age 6 yrs 2, 6, 12. These associations were strongest for those with a history of early aeroallergen sensitization 2.",

While RSV is not a predominant cause of asthma exacerbations in the older child or adult, debate has continued on the causal relationship to the subsequent development of asthma 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27. Several studies have demonstrated that RSV\u2010related severe LRTIs, particularly those requiring hospitalization, are associated with an increased risk of asthma diagnosis at school age 28, 29. A prospective cohort study conducted in Sweden by Sigurs and associates 28, 30 used a case\u2013control design to compare 47 hospitalized infants with documented RSV infection in infancy to 97 healthy controls, measuring rates of asthma and allergic sensitization over time. By the 18\u2010yr follow\u2010up, they found a higher percentage of both current asthma diagnosis (39% vs. 9%, p < 0.001) and allergic sensitization (41% vs. 14%, p = 0.005) in the RSV group than in the control 30. Using a multivariate analysis approach, RSV infection was found to be the major risk factor in subsequent asthma development (OR 7.2). They concluded that severe early RSV bronchiolitis was associated with increased prevalence and persistence of allergic asthma into early adulthood. The Tucson Children's Respiratory Study (TCRS) reported persisting respiratory symptoms (wheeze) through early adolescence in subjects who experienced outpatient RSV LRTI during the first 3 yrs of life. Interestingly, the association to wheeze diminished with age and lost significance by 13 yrs of age 29. The Tennessee Asthma Bronchiolitis Study (TABS), a large unselected population\u2010based retrospective study of children identified through a Medicaid database, investigated the relationship between winter virus infection and asthma 31, 32. They found that the risk of asthma by age 5 increased with the timing of infant birth in relation to the peak of the winter virus season, with subjects born 120 days prior to winter virus peak having the highest risk 31.",

They found on prospective follow\u2010up that the incidence of recurrent wheezing was significantly lower in the palivizumab\u2010treated group than for the untreated controls, suggesting that prevention of LRTI with RSV could reduce the development of persistent wheezing 33. A recent randomized controlled trial by Blanken et al. showed that otherwise healthy premature infants treated with palivizumab had a relative reduction of 61% (95% CI 56\u201365) in the number of wheezing days within the first year of life when compared with controls that received a placebo injection during the RSV season. Perhaps even more encouraging was the demonstration of the extended protective benefit from palivizumab, noting a persistent reduction in total wheezing days and respiratory\u2010related hospitalizations >2 months out from the last palivizumab injection 34.

While definitive conclusions are limited due to the small sample size of the study, the results argued against the role of severe RSV infection in the development of asthma, as earlier studies had implied.

With improved ability to recognize and identify a growing number of bacteria within the airway, the natural progression to investigate their potential role in chronic pulmonary diseases has come to the forefront of focus. Bisgaard et al. published data from a large birth cohort study of high\u2010risk subjects identified at birth by maternal history of asthma, that noted positive associations between bacterial colonization with streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, and moraxella catarrhalis (or a combination of these organisms) in the hypopharynx of asymptomatic neonates, and the subsequent development of asthma (prevalence in colonized 33%, not colonized 10%, OR 4.57) within the first 5 yrs of life 48. The association was found to be \u2018time specific\u2019, that is, present only for the infants colonized by 1 month but not at 12 months of age 48.

Similar findings were noted by De Shutter et al., who retrospectively analyzed a population of recurrent wheezing children between the ages of 4 and 48 months, who underwent bronchoscopy and BAL after failing to respond to inhaled corticosteroids 50.

Saglani and colleagues performed endobronchial biopsies on both wheezing subjects (aged 3 months to 5 yrs) and age\u2010matched controls 53. Unlike the pathogenic hallmarks of asthma established for older children and adults, they found no evidence of eosinophilic inflammation nor reticular basement membrane thickening in the infant wheezers (median age 12 months), even in the presence of atopy 54, 55. However, these pathologic markers were noted in slightly older wheezing children (median age 29 months), suggesting that the time between 1 and 3 yrs of age is a critical period for asthmatic airway remodeling and that changes are not a congenital phenomenon, but more likely a consequence of environmental exposures and disease development over time 53.",
