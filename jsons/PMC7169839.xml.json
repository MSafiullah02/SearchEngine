The earliest cases of SARS occurred in mid\u2010November 2002 in Guangdong Province, China (Feng et al. 2009). The WHO received the first official report on 11 February 2003, notifying an outbreak of atypical pneumonia, which had affected 305 persons and resulted in five deaths in Guangdong Province until that date (WHO 2003b). Global air travel facilitated the international spread of SARS, and seeded new cases in other parts of the world (Parashar & Anderson 2004). Fortunately, SARS was brought under control within 7 months after it appeared. SARS has to date not reappeared, but it is probably still circulating in wild animals and could emerge again in humans. Ebola, for example, re\u2010emerged about 15 years after the initial small outbreak (Burton & Parren 2000).",

Few studies, however, have attempted to capture the spatial component in the epidemic data (Lai et al. 2004; Wang et al. 2006). Most studies were based on the reported date of each case using web\u2010based SARS datasets (Boulos 2004). In addition, the lag time from onset date to confirmed/reported date for probable SARS cases may vary from place to place, making it difficult to estimate and compare epidemic status of SARS in various epidemic areas, because they may have resulted from different time intervals.",

Thereafter, we created a point\u2010type map layer of SARS cases by using the function of adding XY data in arcgis 9.0 software (ESRI Inc., Redlands, CA, USA). To characterise the SARS epidemic situation during the whole epidemic period, we first counted the number of SARS cases of each county or township, then created a cumulative incidence map of SARS epidemics and fitted a smoothly tapered surface to each case\u2019s location by using a kernel density analysis. Further, we examined the spread of SARS over month at a county/township scale. A map series of the monthly distributions of SARS cases was created for periods from November of 2002 to May of 2003. To characterise the temporal dynamics distribution of SARS onset in serious SARS epidemic areas, we defined an area to be serious if the total number of SARS cases was more than 100. Six provinces, Guangdong, Shanxi, Hebei, Beijing, Tianjin, as well as Inner Mongolia autonomous region, were identified as serious epidemic areas and their epidemic curve of SARS onset was created. In addition, a tracking analysis was conducted to identify geographic features and transmission dynamics of SARS epidemics through the use of tracking analysis function in arcgis 9.0 software. We symbolised the onset locations of SARS patients and changed their appearance based on temporal onset date (rather than reporting date), and performed playback tracking on the epidemic dynamics of SARS according to a 5\u2010day interval (the average latent period of SARS). Then an animation was created to record the playback information and show the epidemic dynamic of epidemic areas as audio video interleave (AVI) format (Environmental Systems Research Institute, Inc 2004).",

Since healthcare providers were at great risk of contracting the pathogen, we also obtained data on hospital information, counted the number of medical staffs and linked medical density with the SARS incidence map of each county. Furthermore, the data on the population in 2003 were used to calculate the population density in the analysis.",

We extracted five factors for each of the 345 counties from the digital maps using spatial analysis techniques: intersected by national highway, freeway or railway, and medical staff density and population density were used as correction factors. Standard logistic regression was performed, and odds ratios (ORs), their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and P\u2010values were estimated. The variables, medical staff density and population density, were first examined categorically, which resulted in approximately linear patterns. They could then be included as continuous variables in logistic regression analysis. We used units of medical staff per 100 persons (%) and 1000 persons per km2, respectively.",

The beginning of the epidemic mainly concerned infections within Guangdong Province and spread to neighbouring Guangxi Province from November 2002 to January 2003. While the outbreak continued to spread at a great speed in South China, it started in North China from February to March 2003. At this stage, the SARS epidemic still dominated in the south of China. Meanwhile, local epidemics took place in Beijing and Shanxi Province and some sporadic cases were found in Central China. Shortly after that, local spread continued to increase and the outbreak predominated in North China including Beijing, some areas of Shanxi Province, Inner Mongolia Autonomic Region, Hebei Province and Tianjin in April 2003. Thereafter, the spread of SARS fluctuated at low level in South China and local epidemics or sporadic cases were still found in the Northeast China and Central China. In the final stage, the SARS epidemics slowed down quickly in North China and ceased in South China in May 2003.

They seemed to be largely distributed along transportation routes from Beijing (Figure 4). Univariate logistic regression analyses showed that counties/townships crossed by national highway, railway or inter\u2010provincial freeway were significantly associated with presence of SARS cases (Table 1). As expected, medical staff density and population density also showed a significant positive association with presence of SARS. Multivariate analysis confirmed the pattern in Figure 4 that places crossed by national highway and inter\u2010provincial freeway had significantly more often local SARS cases or epidemics, even after correcting for medical staff density and population density (Table 1). The significant effect of railway disappeared after correcting for the other factors, whereas population density and medical staff density remained as important factors associated with higher risk of SARS infections. Our data further indicated that 98.1% (919/937) of all SARS cases in this part of China were located in counties intersected by national highways (not shown), which accounted for 71.3% of all counties. As for freeways, 79.2% (742/937) of all SARS cases were located in counties intersected by them (not shown), which accounted for 28.4% of all counties.",

The epidemic spanned a large geographical extent but clustered in two areas: first in Guangdong Province, and about 3 months later in Beijing with its surrounding areas in Shanxi Province, Inner Mongolia Autonomic Region, Hebei Province and Tianjin. SARS has certainly benefited from the opportunities for rapid spread along transportation routes, because counties in the neighbourhood of Beijing that were crossed by a national highway or inter\u2010provincial freeway showed the highest risk of acquiring SARS infections, even after correction for population density and medical staff density. Being intersected by a railway did not significantly associate with risk of SARS.",

From geographic mapping to location\u2010based alerting services, geo\u2010informatics plays an important role in the study and control of infectious disease outbreaks (Gething et al. 2006; Viboud et al. 2006; Eisen & Eisen 2007; Riley 2007). As recognised previously, international spread of SARS was largely related to air trips (Wilder\u2010Smith et al. 2003; Wilder\u2010Smith 2006). In our study, we were the first to analyse the spatial pattern of transmission along the routes of national travel. We limited this analysis to the vicinity of Beijing, because a similar analysis at national level would be unduly influenced by the transport conditions of Beijing and Guangzhou area, the two main hotspots of the SARS endemic. In the vicinity of Beijing, it was possible to compare county cases and controls on the presence of transport facilities.",

On the one hand, SARS spread to new epidemic areas randomly through certain index cases, and this pattern played an important role of SARS spread in the early period of SARS epidemic, especially before strict control measures were taken. This pattern has also resulted in transmission of SARS by air travel (Olsen et al. 2003). On the contrary, human travel along the transportation routes influenced the transmission of SARS. This was illustrated by the spread of SARS in North China and South China, which displayed different spatiotemporal characteristics. The SARS epidemic period in North China was shorter than that in South China, but the geographic spread was wider than that in South China. SARS not only spread locally, but also diffused quickly and resulted in several outbreaks in areas of North China close to Beijing city. In contrast, the SARS epidemic in South China was mainly limited to Guangdong Province.",

However, especially national highways and inter\u2010provincial freeways appeared to play a role, whereas railways seemed to be less important. In mainland China, trains are mainly used for occasional long\u2010distance travelling, whereas highways and freeways are more often used for daily or weekly commuting, especially because buses are more flexible in time. Many people from provinces nearby Beijing work in Beijing city, the political, cultural and economic centre, and use buses or cars for travelling. When the SARS epidemic in Beijing began, many of them decided to return home, thereby spreading SARS from Beijing to nearby provinces. This was also illustrated by our finding that 34 SARS cases became infected in Beijing but were reported by hospitals outside Beijing. In addition, because of the limited space in buses compared with trains, the vehicles are usually more crowded and filled with stagnant air, possibly facilitating infection to fellow travellers. Buses, highways and freeways remain important modes of human travel between Chinese cities and provinces, and for this reason are important targets for the control of re\u2010emerging SARS, or other future emerging human\u2010to\u2010human transmittable infections.",
