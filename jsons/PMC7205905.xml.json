Among these approved drugs, 39 were targeted drugs (Table 1), including 27 small molecules, 3 antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), 1 RNA interference (RNAi) therapy, 1 antisense oligonucleotide, 4 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), 1 recombinant fusion protein, and 2 synthetic peptide analogs. The targets included kinases, ion channels, exons, enzymes, and receptors. Oncology, which remains the most important drug discovery area, accounted for 23% (9/39) of the targeted drug approvals.",

Although the development of small molecules has slowed slightly in recent years, the 27 small molecule targeted drugs approved in 2019 accounted for nearly 70% of the total number of approved targeted drugs. Small molecule drugs have the advantages of oral bioavailability, pharmacokinetics, drug delivery, production cost, etc., which facilitate the development of this class of drugs, and this comparative advantage will continue in the near future. In addition, small molecules may be used in conjunction with new types of therapies, such as antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs).",

ADCs comprise a monoclonal antibody and cytotoxic agents conjugated via a chemical linker. The specificity of mAbs allows the chemotherapy agents to be selectively delivered to targeted cancer cells, thereby reducing toxicity. Importantly, mAbs such as trastuzumab not only show specificity but also have anticancer effects. To date, seven ADCs have been approved by the FDA for clinical use, and over 100 ADCs are in clinical development.3",

In 2019, two gene therapy products were approved\u2014Givlaari (givosiran) from Alnylam Pharmaceuticals and Vyondys 53 (golodirsen) from Sarepta Therapeutics. Givlaari is an RNA interference (RNAi) therapeutic that targets aminolevulinic acid synthase 1 (ALAS1) to treat acute hepatic porphyria (AHP). This is the second RNAi therapy approved by the FDA; Onpattro (patisiran) was the first. Onpattro was also developed by Alnylam Pharmaceuticals and was approved by the FDA in 2018 to treat hereditary TTR-mediated amyloidosis. Both drugs use enhanced stabilization chemistry (ESC)-GalNAc conjugate technology. Vyondys 53 is an antisense oligonucleotide developed from Sarepta\u2019s phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomer (PMO) platform; it was approved to treat Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) patients who have a confirmed mutation of the dystrophin gene that causes exon 53 skipping. In the future, more gene therapies currently under development are likely to be approved in the upcoming years, which would bring hope to individuals with severe, life-threatening diseases or rare diseases.",

Camrelizumab and tislelizumab are humanized IgG4 anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibodies that block the binding of PD-1 to its ligands. The first PD-1 inhibitor to hit the market was pembrolizumab (Keytruda), which was approved by the FDA in 2014. Since, ten PD-1/PD-L1 cancer immunotherapy drugs have come on the market worldwide, four of which were developed by Chinese pharmaceutical companies; these drugs are camrelizumab, tislelizumab, and sintilimab developed by Innovent Biologics and Eli Lilly and toripalimab developed by Shanghai Junshi Bioscience Co., Ltd. Following the FDA approval of Brukinsa (zanubrutinib), tislelizumab was the first drug developed by BeiGene to be approved in China. These young Chinese pharmaceutical companies show great potential in drug discovery, especially for novel targets. As China is the world\u2019s second-largest pharmaceutical market, we expect to see an increase in the number of novel drugs developed in China.",
