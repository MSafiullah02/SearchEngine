The possibility of virus entry via the gastrointestinal (GI) tract after ingestion of virus with food has been raised. So far, there is no proof that virus replicates in the human intestine. The presence of diarrhoea in several patients, the detection of viral RNA in the intestines of two patients and the demonstration of infectious virus in rectal swabs of one patient do not allow one to conclude that the GI tract is a portal of entry or a target organ. Foodborne virus might be a source of infection after ingestion but with virus uptake taking place via oropharyngeal tissues, if this site can serve as portal of entry.

In effect, there is much circumstantial evidence of infection of certain animal species via food and consequently and as a precautionary principle this mode of transmission to animals cannot be ruled out. \u2022 Amongst the reported human cases of H5N1, mainly in Asia, there are two H5N1 cases reportedly related to the consumption of infected raw duck blood products (Source: Update on Epidemiological aspects of H5N1 by P. Horby presented at the \"Groupe d'\u00e9tude d'information sur la grippe\". 18th European Meeting on Influenza and its prevention Sep 19-20-05 in La Baule, France). However, as direct contact with infected live or undressed dead animals cannot be ruled out in these cases, epidemiological data are insufficient to confirm the consumption of infected product as the only transmission route. \u2022 Amongst the 118 reported cases of human infection, most of the cases in Asia have been associated with direct exposure to live or dead infected poultry; however, in many instances, there is not sufficient epidemiological evidence to identify the source of infection (WHO) http://www.who.int/csr/disease/avian_influenza/avian_faqs/en/index.html \u2022 While the level of acidity in the human stomach (pH value 1-3) does have the potential to eliminate the virus, as is widely believed to be the case for normal flu, this effect depends on several factors, such as the virus strain, quantity of virus present in the gastrointestinal tract and other local gastrointestinal factors (e.g. gastric transit time, acquired failure of the gastric acid barrier due to Helicobacter pylori infection, which is common among the healthy elderly, etc.) and the nature and composition of the gastric content. There are however few scientific data on this aspect today. What is certain is that, in the hypothetical circumstance of infectious virus being present in the food, proper cooking of poultry meat and eggs will eliminate any virus present before consumption, thereby preventing even the theoretical possibility of the virus infection being acquired through food consumption.",

Wild birds may serve as healthy carriers of low pathogenic H5 or H7 viruses and transmit these viruses to domestic poultry. After a short or long time of circulation in the poultry population such viruses may acquire a HP phenotype by mutation. AI viruses have several avian species as natural hosts and horizontal transmission between or within these species occur rather easily. The routes of viral uptake in avians are mainly the respiratory tract (aerosols, droplets...) and the digestive tract (oro-faecal...) after direct contact between live birds or after indirect exposure (contaminated feed, water, fomites...). Virus transmission in domesticated poultry, therefore, occurs readily within infected areas. While HPAI viruses traditionally arise in poultry flocks after introduction of a LPAI virus from wild birds, recent evidence has identified a new evolution. It appears that some wild bird species are now directly spreading the H5N1 virus in its highly pathogenic form e.g. during migration. They may even show disease as was observed in central China where 6000 migratory birds died from a HPAI subtype H5N1 infection at the Qinghai lake nature reserve . HPAI viruses may thus be carried over long distances from infected regions to uninfected ones by migratory birds.",

However, during the past decade, 3 different subtypes of HPAI viruses, H5N1, H7N3 and H7N7 have been isolated from humans. These viruses were identified as entirely avian influenza viruses and epidemiological evidence has shown that they were transmitted directly from birds to humans. H5N1 has caused many cases of severe illness and death, whereas the H7 subtypes were mainly associated with conjunctivitis. These viruses, therefore, can now be considered as posing a real zoonotic threat. Confirmed disease cases and seropositivity have been directly linked to outbreaks of illness in poultry caused by certain HPAI virus strains such as H7N7, H7N3, H5N1 but not by others such as H7N1 and H5N2, which indicates that the species barrier is crossed more readily by some virus subtypes than by others (Hayden and Croisier 2005) . Most severe cases of disease have been encountered with H5N1. The occurrence of the zoonoses has to be viewed against the background of exposure of large population of people with millions of infected birds and resulted in a limited number of infected cases.",

Very recently, 12 cases including 4 deaths have been reported in Turkey and one person died of H5N1 in Iraq. These cases of infection and the relatively high mortality rate have created much concern. Human infections and disease have mainly occurred following close contact with infected live, dying or dead chickens (Hayden and Croisier 2005) . High risks were linked to slaughtering, defeathering, butchering and preparation of infected birds for consumption. Contact usually had taken place within a week before the onset of clinical signs (de Jong and Hien 2006) . Inhalation of infectious droplets or self-inoculation of the conjunctival or upper respiratory tract mucosae are considered the most common routes of infection. Exposure to chicken faeces in areas with free ranging poultry has also been proposed as a source of infection. No significant risk has been related to travel in countries with infected poultry or the consumption of poultry products. However, in 33% of the H5N1 infected patients in Vietnam there was no history of direct exposure to poultry, or the source of infection was unknown (Horby, personal communication) . This leaves the possibility for speculation about the existence of modes of virus entry in humans other than the respiratory and conjunctival routes. Consumption of edible tissues from infected avians, and oral contact with contaminated water, have been suggested.",

In one case of fatal H5N1 infection in a boy in Thailand, positive-stranded viral mRNA was not only detected in the lung but also in the small and large intestine, suggesting productive viral infection of the gastrointestinal tract (Uiprasertkul et al. 2005) . No viral RNA was found in plasma, adrenal glands, brain, bone marrow, kidneys, liver and pancreas. The spleen only contained negative-stranded genomic RNA and no positive-stranded messenger RNA, showing that there had been no influenza virus replication. On the other hand, examination of the intestines did not reveal viral antigen-positive cells or histopathological changes and the patient did not show diarrhoea.

If, however, oral uptake of H5N1 virus were able to initiate the infection, it does not necessarily imply that the lower gastrointestinal tract is involved. Virus ingested with food may use the oropharyngeal and upper respiratory tract tissues as portals of entry rather than the lower gastrointestinal tract itself. In H5N1 infected humans, pharyngeal swabs may yield higher viral loads than nasal swabs and this contrasts with the findings during normal human influenza virus infections. This indicates that the oropharynx can be a very important target tissue for H5N1 (Beigel et al. 2005 . It is, therefore, possible that initiation of viral infection after oral virus uptake is a consequence of throat infection rather than of a primary gastro-intestinal infection. Also, if intestinal tissues were to allow active virus replication, intestinal invasion may have been the result of viraemia, considering that infectious H5N1 virus or viral RNA has been demonstrated in the serum of some patients (Beigel et al. 2005 .",

This occurred at a time when many chickens in the area were dying with respiratory disease and neurological signs due to H5N1 virus. These feline species showed a generalised course of disease and lesions were present in the lungs, heart, thymus, stomach, intestines, liver, lymph nodes and brains. Virus replication was demonstrated in bronchiolar epithelium, hepatocytes and cerebral neurons. Clinical symptoms included fever, respiratory distress and neurological signs. These observations show that H5N1 virus infection can occur after oral uptake of contaminated avian carcasses. The site of viral entry upon the oral ingestion of H5N1 virus in tigers and leopards was not determined and no virological examinations of the intestines were performed. The authors suggested that the positive staining for virus nucleoprotein in hepatocytes may have resulted from a heavy virus load that had passed through the digestive tract after carcasses were eaten (Thanawongnuwech et al. 2005) . Involvement of the liver as part of the digestive tract, however, may well have been the result of oropharyngeal or respiratory infection followed by generalisation of the infection rather than initiation in the intestinal tract itself.",

Viral antigen expression and virus-associated ganglioneuritis were observed in the submucosal and myenteric plexi in duodenum and ileum. Virus was detected consistently and at high titres in pharyngeal and nasal swabs, but virus titres were highly variable in rectal swabs. This study showed that H5N1 infection in felids could be established via oral uptake but, again, whether the infection was initiated in the oropharyngeal or gastro-intestinal tissues was not determined. The authors suggested that lesions found in the neural plexi of Meisner and Auerbach may reflect uptake of virus via the intestinal lumen. The suggestion was made because myenteric plexi were not involved in cats which, in a similar experiment, had been inoculated intratracheally with the same virus strain. Viral uptake via intestinal nerve endings was proposed, a mechanism that was shown to occur with herpes simplex virus type 1 (Gesser and Koo 1996) , but other routes of entry were also considered. The neurotropism observed with H5N1 virus in cats was striking and neural pathways of virus spread and dissemination must be considered, as further discussed for H5N1 inoculated mice and ferrets.",

            "text": "Ferrets are known to be naturally susceptible to infection with human influenza viruses, as well as to some swine, equine and avian influenza viruses, and they are a widely used influenza model. Ferrets have been intranasally inoculated with H5N1 viruses isolated in Hong Kong in 1997 (Zitzow et al. 2002) and in other Southeast Asian countries in 2003 and 2004 (Govorkova et al. 2005 , Maines et al. 2005 . H5N1 isolates from humans can induce more severe respiratory disease, fever, lethargy and weight loss than common human H3N2 influenza viruses. Diarrhoea and neurological signs were also seen following exposure to the H5N1 isolates and many infectious were fatal. The H5N1 isolates of human origin caused a systemic infection in ferrets, with high virus titres in the blood, spleen and liver. Only some H5N1 isolates were isolated from the intestine, at virus titres that were at least 100 to 1000 times lower than those in the respiratory tract. Histopathological examinations showed mononuclear cell infiltration in the interalveolar septa in the lungs and in the meninges, choroid plexus and brain parenchyma. Viral antigen-positive cells were only found in the lung alveoli and bronchioli and in neurons in the same areas of the brain where inflammation was present, but not in the intestines, despite the presence of diarrhoea in some ferrets. While the human H5N1 viruses had an obvious neurotropism, virus was also isolated from the brains of ferrets inoculated with normal human H3N2 influenza viruses, which do not spread beyond the respiratory tract in humans, and failed to induce neurological signs in ferrets. Because influenza virus titres in the olfactory bulb of ferrets peaked early in infection, the authors suggest that the virus reaches the central nervous system via the olfactory nerves and ethmoid plate after intranasal inoculation. The H5N1 virus was also isolated from the brains of ferrets without detectable viraemia or replication in internal organs, so that it is unlikely that the virus reaches the nervous system via the circulation. Some pathogenetic events in these ferrets inoculated with H5N1 resemble those in cats, particularly the involvement of extra-respiratory organs and the strong neurotropic character. It should be mentioned that involvement of the central nervous system has also been reported in 2 human cases of H5N1 . In contrast to H5N1 viruses obtained from humans, most avian H5N1 isolates induced only mild disease in ferrets and they replicated only in the respiratory tract.",

H5N1 viruses isolated from humans in Hong Kong in 1997 showed two distinct phenotypes in mice (Gao et al., Lu et al. 1999) . Some viruses were low pathogenic: they replicated exclusively in the respiratory tract, were generally non lethal and animals had cleared the virus by 6 to 9 days post inoculation. Other viruses were highly pathogenic: they replicated in multiple organs in addition to the respiratory tract and caused mortality in the mouse model. Most human isolates from 2003 and 2004, in contrast to avian isolates, were also highly pathogenic for mice (Maines et al. 2005) . One of such highly pathogenic viruses was isolated from the colon of infected mice, at a low virus titre (10 2.5 PFU per gram) (Gao et al. 1999) . In another mouse infection study with similar H5N1 isolates, the stomach, duodenum and large intestine tested negative for influenza viral antigen positive cells (Dybing et al. 2000) . It is very clear, in any case, that the respiratory tract and nervous system are the major sites of H5N1 replication in mice. According to some studies, viraemia is unlikely to contribute to the dissemination of virus to other organs in mice, and this is clearly different in chickens (Tanaka et al. 2003 , Nishimura et al. 2000 . One of the Hong Kong/97 (H5N1) isolates was found to replicate first in epithelial cells of the nasal mucosa, bronchi and alveoli, thereafter it appeared to spread via extensions of the nervus vagus and/or nervus trigeminus to the brain stem and later to the cerebral cortex (Tanaka et al. 2003) . Virus spread to the central nervous system may also be virus dose-dependent, as a less virulent Hong Kong/97 (H5N1) isolate was isolated from the brain after intranasal inoculation with a high virus dose but not with a low virus dose.",

The clinical signs -fever and acute respiratory distress -of H5N1 infection in macaques resembled those in humans and were more severe than those seen with a common human H3N2 influenza virus. Unlike in cats, mice or ferrets, neurological or gastrointestinal symptoms did not occur in H5N1-inoculated macaques. Another difference with the situation in cats, mice or ferrets, was the lack of evidence for replication of H5N1 outside the respiratory tract. The lungs were clearly the major site of H5N1 virus replication. Multiple organ dysfunction was observed without evidence of virus replication in the brain, spleen, liver or kidney, and was probably due to diffuse alveolar damage and acute respiratory distress syndrome. To date no investigations have been reported as to whether or not H5N1 can replicate in the intestines of macaques.",

In fatal human cases of AI due to H5N1, viral replicating RNA was found in the intestines by RT-PCR and infectious virus was found in rectal swabs.

Pathogenesis studies showed that the intestinal plexi of pigs were reached after replication in intestinal epithelial cells and local sensory ganglia; thereafter the virus spread to the spinal cord (Andries and Pensaert 1980) . Neural tropism of H5N1 virus has been shown in several experimentally inoculated mammals such as cats, ferrets and mice and was also confirmed in one human case in Vietnam. The possibility exists, therefore, that H5N1 viruses also have neurotropic characteristics in several mammals and that entry and spread in the body may occur via nerves. Neural spread of H5N1 was shown in mice (Tanaka et al. 2003) while entry via nerve endings in the intestine was suggested in cats (Rimmelzwaan et al, 2006) . Viral entry via nerve endings or neuroepithelial cells and invasion in the body via nerves has often been described for Alphaherpesvirinae (Mettenleiter 2003) .",

Features may differ from one mammalian species to another and from one strain to another. From public health and food safety points of view, it is important to know if consumption of raw food containing HPAI virus can lead to human infection and if so, how and under which conditions. This information will be useful and will make clear which precautions need or need not to be taken when consuming poultry products in or from infected areas. It requires to be determined if the initiation of infection after oral virus uptake occurs via upper respiratory, oropharyngeal and/or gastrointestinal tract tissues, and what type of cells serve as entry routes for HPAI viruses. Animal models in which the pathogenetic events resemble those in humans will be needed. Detailed infection studies in cats, in which several inoculation approaches (e.g. directly in the stomach or intestinal lumen) are used, may provide useful information. It must be clarified if intestinal involvement occurs at the start of the infection, or merely results from a generalised dissemination of the virus to many types of organ tissues.",

The ability of an influenza virus to replicate in a certain host species is influenced by both the sialic acid and linkage types in that host and by the receptor-binding site of the viral HA. The epithelial cells of duck intestine, for example, predominantly express \u03b1 2,3-linked sialic acid and influenza viruses isolated from aquatic birds possess HAs with high affinity for this type of sugar (Ito et al. 1998) . In contrast, \u03b1 2,6-linked sialic acids predominate in the human respiratory tract (Baum and Paulson 1990) and influenza viruses circulating in humans favour binding to this type of sialic acid (Connor et al. 1994) . Small mutations in the receptor binding site of the HA, particularly in amino acids 226 and 228, have been shown to cause a change in receptor specificity from 2-6 to 2-3 siallyl linkages and vice versa (reviewed by Suzuki 2005) .

A first surprising finding was that these cells contained both types of receptors, with 2-6 linkages predominantly found on non-ciliated and 2-3 linkages predominantly on ciliated cells. This suggests that the type of sialic acid linkage may be cell type-rather than speciesdependent. Secondly, both human (H3N2) and avian H5N1 influenza viruses were able to replicate in these differentiated human airway epithelial cells. During the first cycle of virus replication human viruses preferentially infected non-ciliated cells and avian viruses mainly infected ciliated cells, which correlates with the expression of the corresponding types of sialic acid receptors. In later cycles of virus replication, the human but not the avian virus infected both ciliated and non-ciliated cells. Most avian H5N1 viruses that were isolated from humans in South East Asia had an avian virus-like receptor specificity (Matrosovich et al. 1999) , which shows that avian-to-human transmission can occur despite the predominance of human receptors in humans. These data indicate that the particular role of receptor-binding sites as a barrier for the replication of AI viruses in humans is often oversimplified.",

The first H5N1 influenza virus that infected humans in Hong Kong in 1997 appeared to be a reassortant with the HA gene from Goose/Guangdong/96 and the other genes from different (non-H5) avian influenza viruses . The Hong Kong /97 (H5N1) viruses were rapidly eliminated by the culling of millions of poultry, but its precursors continued to persist in geese in southern China. Highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza viruses have been circulating in wild geese in China since 1996 and they have gone through several reassortment events by which they acquired new internal genes in various combinations from influenza viruses circulating in aquatic birds (Sims et al. 2005 It must be recognized that, since 2004, H5N1 isolates have infected the greatest number of humans ever, as well as felidae and pigs. Some believe, therefore, that the evolution of H5N1 viruses in recent years has been associated with increasing transmissibility to humans. On the other hand, it must be considered that the increased number of human infections may merely reflect the more frequent and more extensive exposure due to the large epidemics that have occurred in poultry since 2003 and that there is in fact no proof of an increase in the ability of the virus to replicate in mammals between 1997 and now.

In cats, nerve plexi in the intestinal wall were infected after oral administration of H5N1 and virus uptake via nerve endings in the intestinal lumen was proposed, an entry mechanism that has been described for the human herpes simplex virus type 1 (Gesser and Koo 1996) . It has become clear that H5N1 virus shows neurotropic characteristics in different mammalian species, while there has been only one reported case of H5N1 associated encephalitis in humans . A study in mice demonstrated that H5N1 replicated in the respiratory tissues, ascended to the brain stem via the vagus and trigeminal nerves, but not via the blood, and then spread to other areas of the brain (Tanaka et al. 2003) . One should be careful, of course, when extrapolating pathogenetic features of H5N1 viruses in mice to humans. However, neurotropic variants of H5N1 were rapidly selected after virus passage in mice and the possibility of a similar rapid selection of variants in humans or other mammals should be considered (Lipatov et al. 2003) . The question arises whether H5N1 in mammals may use neural pathways to enter the body with or without prior replication in epithelial-like target cells in mucosal sites. Neuro-epithelial cells located in the upper respiratory tract could also serve this purpose. This potential mode of virus uptake needs further study in mammals and certainly deserves more attention in human cases.",

Another option is that the virus replicates in epithelial cells of the respiratory tract, as human influenza viruses do, but that replication in these cells is hampered by some as yet unknown conditions. One possibility is that most of the AI virus particles fail to undergo a complete replication cycle in epithelial cells, so that there is no or minimal production of infectious progeny virus particles. This is in agreement with the finding that the H5N1 isolates from humans have a deletion in the stalk of the NA and that a short-stalked NA is inefficient in disaggregating progeny virus from infected cells. Another possibility is that innate immune proteins in respiratory secretions prevent initial infection with AI viruses in humans. The pulmonary surfactant proteins A and D and the scavenger receptor-rich glycoprotein 340, for example, have influenza A virus neutralizing and aggregating activity (White et al. 2005) . Studies on the effect of these proteins on AI viruses are still lacking, and it remains to be seen whether they exert more potent effects on avian than on human influenza viruses. Finally, it cannot be excluded that existing immunity to human H1N1 and H3N2 influenza viruses confers a partial protection against infection of humans with H5N1. Despite the lack of serological cross-reaction between the HAs of these viruses, antibodies to the N1 of H1N1 and/or cell-mediated immunity could reduce the chance for infection with H5N1.

There is thus circumstantial evidence that virus quantity at exposure must be high for the infection to become established. Again, this implies that the target cells or entry sites for the virus may not be easily reached. Also, an AI virus must overcome several unidentified barriers to infect humans. Whether high quantities of infectious virus reach in the intestinal lumen after consumption of infected food is doubtful, considering the many adverse conditions to which the virus is exposed in the GI tract. After being swallowed, the virus will adsorb on to tissues in the upper digestive tract such as those in the oesophagus and the stomach, and it will be diluted during the digestive processes. Its infectivity titre may be reduced by the extremely low pH of gastric secretions and by the effects of bile, when passing the stomach and the duodenum respectively. Inactivating effects of bile were demonstrated with several enveloped viruses including Newcastle disease virus (Lee and Hanson 1975) . The chance of high amounts of virus reaching the intestinal lumen is thus rather low, unless abnormally high virus titres are taken up (such as when eating raw blood pudding from viraemic ducks) or when the virus is protected from inactivation (such as in bone marrow of bones eaten by carnivores).",

There is no evidence that the virus replicates in the human intestine or that GI symptoms are due to direct effects of the virus in that organ. Even if virus uptake in the GI tract were possible, e.g. via nerve endings as was suggested in the experimentally inoculated cats, the chances that these endings would be hit are very slim. A minimal infectious dose of the virus must be able to reach the intestinal lumen considering the many barriers which have to be overcome. Diarrhoea, which was seen in some of the human H5N1 cases, may be a non-specific symptom. Similarly, the presence of viral RNA or even of infectious virus in rectal swabs does not allow one to conclude that the GI tract is a portal of entry or target organ for H5N1 virus. Viral RNA or infectious virus may have been produced in throat or respiratory tissues and swallowed, or could have reached the intestine after generalisation from other infected targets. Food that contains virus could be a source of infection if viral uptake were to occur via oropharingeal tissues. Also, the existence of an undisclosed target cell in the intestinal tract cannot be ruled out. The exact portal(s) of entry of the virus in humans have not been localised or identified. Epidemiological evidence suggests that infection in humans occurs rarely and occurs particularly after very close contact with infected animals. It is, therefore, likely that a high dose of virus may be needed to initiate an infection and that a readily accessible entry route for the virus does not exist. Experimental studies on the exact route(s) of H5N1 virus entry in mammals are needed and may provide useful information for the human infection.",
