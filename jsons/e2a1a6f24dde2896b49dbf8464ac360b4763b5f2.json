One of the most serious complications of Corona virus disease (COVID-2) is the development of an atypical upper respiratory tract pneumonia that poses a major challenge to clinicians in terms of disease management. An abnormal and uncontrolled production of cytokines has been observed in critically ill patients with COVID-19 pneumonia 1 and the ensuing uncontrolled cytokine storm in COVID-19 patients is centrally involved in the exacerbation of symptoms and disease development, and represents a major factor contributing to COVID-19 mortality. In this sense, COVID-19 disease shares similarities with other viral diseases such as SARS, MERS and influenza, where the development of a cytokine storm is a warning sign of disease escalation.",

Guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infected pneumonia were first published on January 30 th 2020, and recommended for the first time that cytokine monitoring be applied to improve the curative rate and reduce mortality 3 . In view of the severe morbidity and mortality of COVID-19 pneumonia, here we review the current understanding of treatment of human coronavirus infections from the perspective of a dysregulated immune response.",

Unfortunately, these viruses are often difficult to control due to the lack of approved antiviral drugs and vaccines. In addition to SARS-CoV2, two other novel coronaviruses have emerged as global health threats since 2002, namely severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV in 2002) that was transmitted to 37 countries, and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV in 2012) that was transmitted to 27 countries. Severe pneumonia caused by pathogenic human coronaviruses (HCoV) are often associated with induced hypercytokinemia, also termed cytokine storm, in immunocompetent individuals; uncontrolled overproduction of inflammatory cytokines contributes to acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).",

IL-6, which is an important target in CRS induced by adoptive cell therapy, can lead to vascular leakage, activation of complement and the coagulation cascade, leading to the characteristic symptoms of severe CRS, such as diffuse intravascular coagulation (DIC) 5, 6 . It is noteworthy that IL-6 is likely to cause cardiomyopathy by promoting myocardial dysfunction, which is often observed in patients with CRS 7 . In addition, activation of endothelial cells may also be one of the hallmarks of severe CRS. Endothelial dysfunction can lead to capillary leakage, hypotension, and coagulopathy 8 ( Figure 1 ). Taken together, these studies argue that the virus-induced immunopathological events play a crucial role in the fatal pneumonia observed after HCoV infections 9 .",

The uncontrolled production of pro-inflammatory factors, containing IL-6, IL-8, IL-1\u03b2, and GM-CSF, and chemokines such as CCL2, CCL-5, IP-10, and CCL3, together with reactive oxygen species cause ARDS leading to pulmonary fibrosis and death 12 .",

In MERS infection, high levels of serum pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6 and IFN-\u03b1) and chemokines (IL-8, CXCL-10, and CCL5) were likewise observed in severe disease, compared to mild or moderate disease 14 . In contrast to SARS and MERS, doctors in Wuhan Central South Hospital found that the levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1a and TNF \u03b1 were significantly elevated in the blood of severely ill patients, compared to patients with mild illness 2 . The level of IL-6 in the blood of the severe group was 76% higher than that of the mild group (30%) 15 . Furthermore, histological examination and biopsy samples obtained from a patient who died from severe SARS-CoV-2 infection showed an increased concentration of highly proinflammatory CCR4+CCR6+ Th17+ CD4 T cells, suggesting that T cell hyperactivation contributesdin part to the severe immune injury in this patient 16 . Pulmonary examination in other patients with early phase SARS-COV-2 pneumonia also revealed patchy inflammatory cell infiltration; however, the pathological results in early stage of SARS-CoV2 pneumonia require further confirmation 17 . In short, aberrant release of multiple cytokines appears to trigger a cytokine storm that produces immunopathogenic damage to tissues and organs, even while the immune response seeks to suppress and eradicate the virus (Figure 1 ).",

In the clinical process of COVID-19 pneumonia, there is window period between the diagnosis and the occurrence of MODS (about 5-7 days). After this window, the majority of patients tend to improve (~80%), whereas ~20% of the patients progress to severe pneumonia, with ~ 2% mortality 23,24 , 2 . To improve the prognosis, we suggest that patients with COVID-19 pneumonia be given immunotherapy treatment at the time of diagnosis, in order to block the possibility of a subsequent cytokine storm. The early use of immunological intervention in the evaluation of patients with MODS may reduce mortality in the most severe patients. ( Figure  2 , position 2).",

As an example of one study, five patients critically ill with COVID-19 and on mechanical ventilation received convalescent plasma 10 to 22 days after being admitted to a hospital in Shenzhen, China. All patients improved; three were discharged after 50 days in hospital, while the other two patients were in stable condition.

Originally described as B-cell differentiation factor-2 (BSF-2) and macrophage and granulocyte induction factor-2 (MGI-2), IL-6 has significant pro-inflammatory and pyrogenic properties, and given chronic overproduction in COVID-19 patients, anti-IL-6 monoclonal antibody may be beneficial in controlling cytokine release. Also IL-17 inhibitor (Secukinumab) (Novartis) was used as specific treatment for severe patients with COVID-19 pneumonia 25 to control Th17 cell activation. An additional observation indicated that the expression levels of CD4 + T and CD8 + T were low, while IL-6 levels were high in patients with severe pneumonia, suggesting that T cell subsets and cytokine levels could be used as one predictor of the transition from mild to severe pneumonia 15 .",
