One study of 1210 respondents from 194 cities in China in January and February 2020 found that 54% of respondents rated the psychological impact of the Covid-19 outbreak as moderate or severe; 29% reported moderate to severe anxiety symptoms; and 17% reported moderate to severe depressive symptoms. 2 Notwithstanding possible response bias, these are very high proportions-and it is likely that some people are at even greater risk. During the 2009 H1N1 influenza outbreak ('swine flu'), a study of mental health patients found that children and patients with neurotic and somatoform disorders were significantly over-represented among those expressing moderate or severe concerns. 3 Against this background, and as the Covid-19 pandemic continues to spread around the world, we hypothesize a number of psychological impacts that merit consideration now rather than later.",
