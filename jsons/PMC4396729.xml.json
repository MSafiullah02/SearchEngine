            "text": "Hemagglutinin (HA) of influenza virus mediates both receptor binding and membrane fusion [10]. HA cleavage is important for viral infectivity; HA proteins are synthesized as HA0 precursor proteins during transport through the Golgi apparatus. HA0 is cleaved by host cell protease into HA1 and HA2 subunits [11, 12]. Cleaved HA proteins bind to cell receptor and then are endocytosed into the endosome where they undergo conformational changes and exposure of fusion peptide on HA2 subunit under low pH. Then, the fusion peptide is inserted into the cell membrane and mediates the formation of fusion pore [13, 14]. Fusion relies on precise HA0 cleavage for a fusion-capable HA2 subunit. HA proteins of H5 highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (HPAIV) have multibasic cleavage sites (R-X-R/K-R) which can be cleaved by ubiquitously expressed furin or PC5/6 protease to cause fatal systemic infections [15\u201317]. HA of most of the other mammalian and avian influenza viruses contains a single arginine (or lysine) at the cleavage site, so cleavage of these HAs is restricted to the respiratory tract in mammals and to the respiratory and intestinal tracts in avians and assumed to be processed extracellularly by trypsin-like proteases. Of these proteases, some type II transmembrane serine proteases (TTSPs) family members such as human airway trypsin-like (HAT) protease, transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2), transmembrane protease, serine 4 (TMPRSS4), and mosaic serine protease large form (MSPL) play important roles in influenza viral infection. TTSPs are expressed in the airways and can cleave multiple strains of influenza HA protein. B\u00f6ttcher and colleagues reported a cell-associated cleavage of influenza viruses HA with a monobasic cleavage site by HAT and TMPRSS2 [18]. Wang and colleagues reported that TMPRSS2 and HAT could cleave the HA of the H1, H3, and H5 subtypes [19]. Zmora and colleagues demonstrated that mosaic serine protease large form (MSPL)could activate HA protein of H1N1 and H3N2 influenza virus [20], while Okumura and colleagues confirmed that MSPL can cleave the HA protein of H5 HPAIV and support their multicycle replication [21].",

Thus, HA must be proteolytically cleaved into HA1 and HA2 subunits to acquire cell fusion ability and infectivity. Many trypsin-like proteases which can cleave HA protein have been reported (plasmin, tryptase Clara, swine mast cell tryptase, chicken embryo trypsin-like protease, and coagulation factor Xa) [24, 25]. These proteases were isolated from tissues and biochemically characterized, but their molecular identity is unknown. Recently, human type II transmembrane serine proteases (TTSPs) have come under study and TTSPs such as HAT, TMPRSS2, TMPRSS4, and MSPL were found to be capable of cleaving different subtypes of influenza viruses. TMPRSS2 and HAT could cleave the HA protein of H1, H2, H3, and H5 viruses and the 1918 \u201cSpanish flu\u201d virus [18, 19, 26]. It is noteworthy that MSPL can activate different subtypes of influenza virus HA protein possessing either monobasic or multibasic amino acid cleavage site. Zmora and colleagues demonstrated that MSPL can activate the HA protein of H1 and H3 influenza virus as well as the 1918 \u201cSpanish flu\u201d virus [20]. While Kido and colleagues reported that MSPL can cleave an H5 influenza HA-derived multibasic peptide, which was not efficiently cleaved by furin [21, 27], the study of Okumura and colleagues confirmed that MSPL can activate the HA protein of H5 HPAIV and support their multicycle replication [21]. The versatile cleaving ability of MSPL is the major reason we use it to construct the stable cell line.",
