This suggests that activation of apoptotic mechanisms may be critical to clearing RSV-infected epithelial cells when cytotoxic T cell responses are absent. In contrast, caspase 3 staining was more prominent in macrophages and neutrophils in subjects with fatal cases of influenza virus infection. Although definitive conclusions are not possible, one possible explanation of the findings is that the expression of viral antigen was already declining in subjects of influenza virus infection (and bronchiolar epithelium was more intact) and that apoptosis was being induced in macrophages and neutrophils to reduce the inflammatory response. Further study of this critical area is needed. Other models of lung injury demonstrate that apoptotic signals are expressed on damaged epithelium immediately after toxic injury to the lungs. However, after the toxin has been cleared, apoptosis is prominent in inflammatory cells, presumably reflecting an attempt to terminate inflammation [44] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1194, "end": 1198, "text": "[44]", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "Limitations of the present study include the fact that cytokines were measured only once during the time of acute illness. We attempted to correct for this deficiency by studying the kinetics of mediator responses in samples grouped by day 1-5 of illness. Quantities of IFN-g, IL-4, and IL-17 declined over this interval. Although this suggests that we did not miss the eventual development of lymphocyte cytokine responses, follow-up samples obtained over several days would have been preferable. Another limitation is that samples of secretions for cytokine analysis, viral quantitation, and pathological analysis were not available from the same subjects. Nevertheless, bronchiolitis as a disease entity is thought to be similar in presentation worldwide [45] [46] [47] , so regional differences in pathogenesis are unlikely.

Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS)-positive material (mucus) was found in the airway in only 1 subjects with influenza virus infection and was absent in the other 19 subjects with RSV and influenza virus infection.

Surprisingly, CD4 antigen-positive cells were present at a very low frequency in the lungs of subjects with fatal bronchiolitis (or normal infant lung tissue), regardless of the nature of the infecting agent (figure 3, upper panels). CD8 antigen-positive cells also were only rarely detectable in these tissues, again regardless of the nature of the infecting virus (lower panels). CD4 and CD8 cells were readily detectable in tonsil tissue by use of the same IHC techniques. The findings infigure 3were entirely representative of those in specimens from all 20 subjects with fatal bronchiolitis.CD56 antigen-positive cells. The results of IHC staining for CD56 antigen-positive (NK) lymphocytes in the lungs of subjects with fatal LRTI are shown in figure 4. Cells positive for CD56 antigen were rarely detectable in normal infant lungs or in the lungs of subjects with influenza virus or RSV infection. CD56 antigen was readily detectable in stains of a human lung cancer biopsy sample (data not shown). Granzyme-positive cells. As is demonstrated in the upper left panel of figure 5, normal infant lung is negative for granzyme, a lymphotoxin. Subjects with influenza virus (upper right) and RSV (lower left) infection were also granzyme negative. The expected positive staining for granzyme of lymphocytes present in a biopsy sample from a lung cancer patient is demonstrated in the lower right panel. CD16 antigen-positive cells. Lung tissues from infants with fatal RSV and influenza virus LRTI were studied for expression of the neutrophil and macrophage antigen CD16 (figure 6). CD16 antigen was not observed in normal infant lung tissue (left panel). In contrast, strongly positive staining was observed in subjects with RSV or influenza virus infection (center and right panels). Staining was noted in inflammatory cells in the alveolar space and interstitium and in cells within the exudate that obstructed the bronchiolar lumen. Caspase 3 staining. We next stained lung tissues for the apoptosis marker caspase 3 (figure 7). Normal infant lung tissue (left panel) did not demonstrate positive staining for caspase 3.
