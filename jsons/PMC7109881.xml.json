Active surveillance for respiratory infections was performed at Rochester General Hospital (Rochester, New York) from 15 November 1999 to 15 April 2000 as part of an ongoing study to identify influenza and RSV infections. All patients >65 years old and those with underlying heart or lung conditions admitted with a clinical diagnosis of acute respiratory infection, bronchitis, exacerbation of COPD, congestive heart failure (CHF), influenza, or pneumonia were invited to participate. Demographic and clinical information was collected during patient interviews and from medical records. Combined nasal and pharyngeal swab specimens were tested for influenza virus and RSV by culture and RT-PCR. Acute and convalescent blood samples (at ~4 weeks) were obtained for serologic testing in as many cases as possible. During the 5 months of surveillance, 332 illnesses in 316 hospitalized persons were evaluated. Sixty-one cases of influenza A infection and 22 cases of RSV infection were identified and excluded from subsequent analysis. Of the 249 remaining cases, 100 samples were randomly selected for rhinovirus and coronavirus testing.",

RTPCR for human rhinovirus (HRV) and human coronaviruses (HCV) was done by methods described elsewhere, with minor modifications [12, 13]. Total RNA was extracted from 200 \u00b5L of sample by matrix affinity chromatography (QIAamp DNA blood kit; Qiagen). The eluted RNA was transcribed into cDNA with murine reverse transcriptase (MMLV-RT; Gibco BRL) and virus specific oligonucleotide primer, for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. After MMLV-RT denaturation at 95\u00b0C, virus-specific 5\u2032 biotinylated oligonucleotide primer and Taq polymerase (Applied Biosystems) were added, and 35 cycles of PCR were run, consisting of denaturation (1 min at 95\u00b0C for HRV; 2 min at 95\u00b0C for HCV), annealing (1.5 min at 48.2\u00b0C for HRV; 1 min at 60\u00b0C for HCV), and DNA extension for 1 min at 72\u00b0C. The pairs of primers for coronaviruses OC43 and 229E were used in the same reaction in a multiplex format. Excess primers, dNTPs, Taq DNA polymerase, and salts were removed by adsorbing the amplified product to the QIAquick silica-gel membrane (QIAquick PCR purification kit; Qiagen). The presence of the PCR product was detected by microplate hybridization with digoxigenin-labeled virusspecific probes, as described elsewhere [13]. Positive and negative controls were previously tested nasal washings either containing or lacking specific HRV or HCV RNA.",

Seventy-five percent had exposure to young children. Compared with patients infected with influenza during the same period, the rhinovirus/coronavirus group had significantly more lung disease. Nasal congestion and cough were common symptoms (67% and 78%, respectively), as were lower respiratory tract symptoms of dyspnea (83%) and sputum production (58%). Constitutional symptoms, such as fatigue and myalgias, occurred in only 33% of patients with HRV or HCV, compared with 54% in influenza virus-infected patients. Fever was significantly less common in the HRV and HCV group than in the influenza group (mean temperature, 37:4\u00b0C\u00b11:0\u00b0C vs. 38:4\u00b0C\u00b11:1\u00b0C; P = .005).

Most patients received steroids (75%), bronchodilators (83%), and antibiotics (83%). All patients eventually recovered and were discharged after a mean length of stay of 8 days.

[9], documenting coronavirus/rhinovirus infections in 26 (4.7%) of 546 persons #x003E;35 years old who were hospitalizedwith cardiopulmonary illnesses, and with a 4-year study by Glezen et al. [4], in which viruses were found to be a common trigger for acute decompensation leading to hospitalization in persons with preexisting lung diseases. In the latter study of 417 adults \u2a7e45 years old who were hospitalized for respiratory infections, influenza viruses were detected most frequently in 8% of patients, whereas rhinoviruses were detected in 2% and coronaviruses in 3% of patients. However, this study did not use RT-PCR to detect viruses, and rates likelywould have been higher if more-sensitive diagnostic tools were available. In a study of inner-city adults with asthma, rhinoviruses and coronaviruses were more common than influenza in patients presenting to an emergency room [10]. Sixty percent of rhinovirus and 71% of coronavirus infections were detectable only by RT-PCR.",

A limitation of this study is the lack of a control group of hospitalized elderly patients without respiratory illnesses. Previous studies have shown that rhinoviruses may be detected in 3% of asymptomatic elderly adults [11]. The use of a method of diagnosis that detects minute quantities of RNA raises the question of the role of the virus in causality of the illness. Unfortunately, samples from a control group were not available. It was not unexpected that there were patients with positive coronavirus PCR results but negative serologic test results, since antibody responses may be impaired in frail elderly persons.",

One patient required intensive care, but all survived.Of interest, 2 patientswith rhinovirus infections had high fevers and radiographic evidence of pneumonia. Rhinoviruses are rarely implicated as a cause of pneumonia, which is believed to reflect their biologic characteristics [14]. However, recent data from Papadopoulos et al. [15] suggest that infection of the lower airways is possible and that rhinoviruses may have direct effects on the lower respiratory tract epithelium. The high frequency of lower respiratory tract symptoms in ambulatory elderly persons with rhinovirus infections and the recovery of rhinovirus from expectorated sputum samples are additional evidence for viral invasion of the lower airways [5, 11]. It is unknown how often bacterial suprainfection in the lower respiratory tract follows HRV or HCV infection. Despite these uncertainties, mixed viralbacterial infection in our patients seems likely, although one person had CLL, thus making a viral pneumonia a possibility.",
