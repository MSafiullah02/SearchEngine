The development of DPP4 inhibitors as a class of anti-diabetic medications has been widely accepted due to their ease of administration and lack of serious side-effects. It's been widely believed that DPP4 inhibition has beneficial effect on cardiovascular diseases [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6]. However, recently completed large-scale phase 3 and phase 4 clinical trials (EXAMINE and SAVOR-TIMI 53) showed no significant improvements in primary cardiovascular endpoints in patients treated with DPP4 enzymatic inhibitors compared to those with placebo [7], [8], calling into question the cardiovascular efficacy of these agents. However it must be noted that these trials tested whether enzymatic inhibition of DPP4 is beneficial in the short term, and the importance of any of other non-enzymatic effects was not tested.",

The cardiovascular effect of DPP4 was believed to be majorly mediated through an incretin-dependent mechanism. Recent advances in DPP4 non-catalytic activities suggest that the incretin-independent actions of DPP4 may also play an essential role in cardiometabolic disease. However, little information of its incretin-independent actions in cardiometabolic disease was introduced in previous reviews. In this review, we will review the importance of DPP4 catalytic-dependent versus -independent activities in the pathophysiology of cardiometabolic disorders. We will also provide recent clinical trial evidence that have tested its effects in cardiovascular disease.",

            "text": "Human DPP4 is a 766 amino acid membrane glycoprotein encoded by the human Dpp4 gene localized to chromosome 2q24, adjacent to GLP-1-encoding gene [14]. Sequence comparison reveals a very high degree of sequence conservation. The overall sequence identity is 88% between human and porcine DPP4, and 83% between human and mouse [15]. DPP4 has a large extracellular domain and a short cytoplasmic (AA 1\u20136) and transmembrane domain (AA7\u201329). The extracellular domain contains a \u03b1/\u03b2-hydrolase domain (Gln508-Pro766) and an eight-blade \u03b2-propeller domain (Arg54-Asn497) (Fig. 1\n) [16]. The C terminal extracellular domain is responsible for the catalytic activity (catalytic triad: Asp708, His740, and Ser630) and binding to a number of proteins including ADA and matrix proteins [16], [17], [18]. DPP4 functions as a homodimer, relying on broad intermolecule contacts contributed by the hydrolase domain and the extended strands in blade IV of the \u03b2-propeller [19]. The catalytic activity of DPP4 depends upon its dimerization state [20], with residues 630, residues 708 and 740 playing a critical role in substrate cleavage [21], [22], [23], [24]. Glycosylation of DPP4 also appears to be important in determining catalytic activity. Glycosylation of Asn-281 in human DPP4 has been proposed to control its assembly [25]. DPP4 can assemble into tetramers on the cell surface and in the circulation by linkage of two homodimers.",

In humans, DPP4 is found at high levels in brush border of the small intestine, kidney proximal tubular cells and glomerular cells, hepatocytes, and activated leukocytes [26]. Significant amounts of DPP4 are also present in blood vessels, particularly in the endothelial cells. Among hematopoietic cells, DPP4 is expressed at the highest level on T cells especially CD4+ T cells, and at lower levels in monocytes and dendritic cells. DPP4 expression is increased as monocytes differentiate into macrophages as well as during T cell activation [27]. Indeed DPP4 was described as a T cell activation marker for a number of years. At organ level, DPP4 is highly expressed in solid organs, including kidney, spleen, lung, pancreas and prostate [20].",

However, whether sDPP4 is cleaved from the membrane or is secreted is unclear. Studies investigating viral liver infection suggested that sDPP4 is shed from membrane bound DPP4 [32], while other studies suggest a secretory mechanism as evidenced by the fact that sDPP4 was detected in the lumen of secretory granules in pancreatic A cells and exocytic secretory lysosomes of natural killer cells [33], [34].",

FAP is absent or produced at low levels in normal adult tissues under baseline conditions and is induced in response to inflammatory conditions and tumors. FAP expression levels correlate with prognosis in a number of malignancies and targeting FAP in epithelial-derived solid tumors has been shown to inhibit tumor growth [37]. FAP associates with thin-cap human coronary fibroatheromata and contributes to type I collagen breakdown in fibrous caps. The origin of FAP in plaque interestingly has been shown to derive from smooth muscle cells rather than macrophages and expression correlates with the degree of inflammation [38]. Plasma levels of FAP have been shown to inversely correlate with mortality in patients with ACS, pointing again to a divergent regulation of plasma vs. tissue levels of FAP [39].",

Interestingly it bears no significant nucleotide or amino acid homology with DPP4. Whereas the order of the catalytic amino acids, Ser-Asp-His, is identical in DPP4 and DPP2, the spacing of the catalytic triad is dissimilar, suggesting different substrate specificities. DPP2 knockout mice are embryonically lethal. Conditional knock-down of DPP2 in specific cell types such as neuroendocrine cells (expressing neurogenin 3, NGN3) in the pancreas as well as regions of the hypothalamus and brain stem displayed a phenotype which is in stark contrast to that of DPP4 knockout mice [41], [42]. NGN3-DPP2 knock-down mice had unaltered levels of active GLP-1 but presented with hyperinsulinemia, accompanied by marked impairment of glucose tolerance, insulin resistance, enhanced liver steatosis, and visceral obesity, whereas DPP4 knockout mice are resistant to diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance [41], [42]. These findings suggest that dipeptidases DPP2 and DPP4 may have distinct substrate specificities and opposing functional roles.",

In contrast to DPP4, both DPP8 and DPP9 are expressed in cytoplasma. They share substrate specificity with DPP4 based on in vitro assays utilizing native peptides or peptide pseudosubstrates. However, their physiologically relevant natural substrates and functions in vivo were not known until recently [44]. Utilizing cytosol-wide analysis of proteome in human ovarian cancer lines stably transfected with DPP8 or 9 using terminal amine isotopic labeling of substrates approach, a recent study identified more than 29 candidate natural substrates and pathways affected by DPP8/DP9 overexpression. Cleavage of 14 substrates was investigated in vitro; 9/14 substrates for both DPP8 and DPP9 were confirmed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, including two of high confidence, calreticulin and adenylate kinase 2. No unique cleavage was identified for DP8 or DP9 demonstrating similar enzyme specificity and large substrate overlap between these enzymes Adenylate kinase 2 plays key roles in cellular energy and nucleotide homeostasis [44]. While in vitro studies have demonstrated non-enzymatic roles for DPP8 and DPP9 in cell migration, proliferation, and apoptosis, the exact physiologic role of these dipeptidases and their in-vivo substrates remain poorly defined [44].",

It has been shown that both expression and catalytic activity of DPP4 were enhanced in diabetes. When in vitro exposed to high glucose, human glomerular endothelial cells displayed an enhanced expression and activity of DPP4 [45], [46]. In line with this finding, circulating DPP4 activity was reported to be increased in patients with type 2 diabetes and positively correlated with HbA1c levels [47], [48]. In diabetic patients, the increase of circulating DPP4 activity results in a reduction of plasma GLP-1 both at fasting and in response to the meal [49]. In addition to circulating DPP4 activity, expression of DPP4 on T cells was reported to increase in patients with T2DM [50]. However, there are also reports suggesting a decrease of circulating DPP4 activity in patients with T2DM [51]. This is probably because most patients included in this study were on anti-diabetic agents, while those medications were reported to reduce circulating DPP4. Several widely-used anti-diabetic agents such as metformin, thiazolidinedione, and pioglitazone were reported to reduce circulating DPP4 [52], [53], [54] and DPP4 on T cells [50].",

When stimulated by IL-12, IFN-\u03b3-producing T cells expressed higher levels of DPP4 compared with IFN-\u03b3 negative cells [27]. Both IFN-\u03b3 and retinoic acid could increase DPP4 transcription in malignant B lymphocytes through STAT1\u03b1 pathway [61].

The expression of DPP4 on gingival fibroblasts is shown to be regulated by IL-1\u03b1 [67].

The regulatory peptide substrates include GLP-1, GLP-2, GIP, gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP), and growth-hormone-releasing factor (GHRF). The active form of GLP-1, GLP-1(7\u201336), could be rapidly converted to an inactive form GLP-1(9\u201336). Similarly, GLP-2(1\u201333), GIP(1\u201342) and GHRF(1\u201329) can be inactivated by DPP4 and converted to GLP-2(3\u201333), GIP(3\u201342), and GHRF(3\u201329) respectively. The chemokines that can be degraded by DPP4 include regulated on activation normal T-cell expressed and presumably secreted (RANTES, also known as CCL5), macrophage derived chemokine (MDC, also known as CCL22), eotaxin (also known as CCL11), monokine induced by IFN-\u03b3 (Mig, also known as CXCL9), IFN-\u03b3-induced protein-10 (IP-10, also known as CXCL10), interferon-inducible T-cell \u03b1 chemoattractant (ITAC, also known as CXCL11), and stromal-cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1, also known as CXCL12). DPP4 alters the specificity of MDC on recruited cell types, while cleavage of N-terminal dipeptides inactivates the chemotactic activity of the other chemokines. A recent study suggests DPP4 also truncates a number of cytokines including GM-CSF, G-CSF, IL-3, and Epo [69]. Genetic ablation of DPP4 or enzymatic inhibition DPP4 activities by inhibitors enhanced hematopoiesis and bone marrow engraftment in mice after irradiation or chemotherapy. More importantly, truncated GM-CSF could serve as an antagonist for full-length GM-CSF as truncated GM-CSF has higher affinity to its receptor but devoid of bioactivity [69]. The neuropeptide substrates of DPP4 include NPY, B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), Peptide YY (PYY), and Substance P. Removal of N-terminal dipeptides by DPP4 alters the receptor subtype specificity of NPY and PYY, reduces activity of substance P and BNP.",

Upon activation, both the percentage of DPP4+ T cells and the number of molecules per cell are elevated [71]. DPP4 on the cell surface of T cells has been demonstrated to be able to directly provide co-stimulatory signal by binding to ADA [70], [72], [73], [74], [75], [76]. The engagement of ADA by DPP4 enhances T-cell activation by activating CD45 [77]. Activation of DPP4 by anti-DPP4 antibodies prolonged and enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of a variety of proteins activated in response to TCR/CD3 engagement [78]. In addition, ADA-independent non-catalytic activity of DPP4 also plays a role in T cell activation. Yu et al. reported that phytohaemagglutinin (PHA)- and Herpes simplex virus antigen (HSV Ag)-induced T-cell proliferation can be enhanced by soluble DPP4, although DPP4 showed no effect on anti-CD3-induced T cell proliferation. Moreover, both enzyme inactive mutant and ADA non-binding mutant promoted HSV Ag-induced T cell proliferation, indicating this effect of soluble DPP4 is mechanistically independent of both the enzymatic activity and ADA-binding capability of DPP4 [79].",

Both GLP-1 and GIP increase the transcription and biosynthesis of insulin, promote \u03b2-cell proliferation, and suppress \u03b2-cell death [84], [85], [86]. GLP-1 is also shown to be able to enhance glucose sensitivity of \u03b2-cell and induce glucose competence in previously unresponsive \u03b2-cells [87], [88]. Clinical studies confirmed the blood glucose lowering effect of exogenous administration of GLP-1 [89], [90]. In addition to pancreas, GLP-1 also reduces blood sugar by acting on many other organs including liver, brain, adipose tissue, and intestine. GLP-1 decreases glycemia in subjects during a pancreatic clamp, a condition with fixed insulin and glucagons level, suggesting that GLP-1 can suppress glucose production independent of islet hormones [91]. GLP-1 diminishes hepatic glucose production, which also contributes to its anti-hyperglyciemia effect [92]. GLP-1 also acts as a neuropeptide to reduce food intake by inhibiting appetite and regulates muscle glucose utilization and insulin secretion by acting on brain GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R) [93], [94], [95]. Furthermore, GLP-1 also suppresses gastric emptying, inhibits adipose inflammation and promotes adipocyte formation by acting on digestive duct and adipose tissue [96], [97], [98].",

The half-life of GLP-1 is less than 2 min, while the half-life of GIP is less than 2 min in rodents and 7 min in human [84], [99], [100]. GLP-1(7\u201336) and GIP(1\u201342), the active forms of GLP-1 and GIP, are converted into inactive forms: GLP-1(9\u201336) and GIP(3\u201342) by a widely expressed enzyme, DPP4. The degradation of GLP-1 and GIP by DPP4 was first reported in early 1990s [101]. An enzymatic removal of N-terminal dipeptides His7-Ala8 from GLP-1 and Tyr1-Ala2 from GIP in plasma was observed in an in vitro experiment, using DPP4 purified from human placenta. Subsequent studies confirmed the metabolism of GLP-1 and GIP mediated by DPP4 did indeed occur in vivo [99], [102]. Accordingly, DPP4 inhibitors emerged as a novel therapeutic approach for type 2 diabetes in clinic [103].",

            "text": "DPP4 inhibitors are a class of newly available oral agents for type 2 diabetes, either as monotherapy or in combination with oral medications such as metformin, glitazones, and sulphonylureas [104]. Treatment with DPP4 inhibitors is usually accompanied with improvement in \u03b2 cell function: improved homeostasis model assessment beta cell function index (HOMA-\u03b2) and fasting proinsulin:insulin ratio [105]. The therapeutic effects of DPP4 inhibitors are based on the ability of DPP4 to degrade the incretin peptides. Inhibition of DPP4 conversely increases the half-life of incretins and contributes to glucose lowering in the post-prandial state [104]. DPP4 inhibitors are only modestly effective as sole glucose-lowering drugs, with a 0.6\u20130.8% lowering of HbA1C in patients with a starting level around 8% [106]. However, they are being increasingly used in clinic due to the safety of these drugs. The side effect incidence is very low with these agents [105], [107]. The most reported side effects of DPP4 inhibitors in clinical trials include nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, urinary tract infection and headache [108]. There are currently several DPP4 inhibitors approved or being approved by FDA or EU, which may be broadly divided into two classes based on structure: DPP4 dipeptide structure mimics and non-peptidomimetics. The first class includes Sitagliptin (\u03b2-amino acid-based), vildagliptin, and saxagliptin, whereas the non-peptidomimetics includes alogliptin (modified pyrimidinedione) and linagliptin (xanthine-based). The approved DPP4 inhibitors available in the market include: sitagliptin (approved by FDA in 2006), vildagliptin (approved by EU in 2007), saxagliptin (approved by FDA in 2009), linagliptin (approved by FDA in 2011), teneligliptin (approved in Japan 2012), anagliptin (approved in Japan 2012), and alogliptin (approved by FDA in 2013). In addition to those approved drugs, more DPP4 inhibitors including dutogliptin [109] and gemigliptin are under development and awaiting FDA approval.",

            "text": "It has been shown that inflammation is a major contributor to insulin resistance and T2DM [110], [111], [112]. Both innate immunity and adaptive immunity are responsible for the development of metaflammation (a metabolic inflammatory state) [110], [111], [112], [113], [114], [115]. Given the role of DPP4 in regulating T cell activation, DPP4 may be an important regulator of metaflammation. In addition, the binding of ADA to membrane-bound DPP4 may also promote T cell activation by clearing peri-cellular adenosine. Extracellular adenosine is generated from ATP by cell surface CD39 [116] and CD73. Excessive amount of adenosine suppresses T cell proliferation. Adenosine is degradated by ADA and generates to inosine, a nontoxic product [117]. Loss-of-function mutations in ADA could cause severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) in both human and mouse by resulting in the accumulation of adenosine [118], [119], [120]. Jurkat cells with a DPP4 mutant devoid of ADA binding activity are vulnerable to inhibitory effect on proliferation [121], indicating that DPP4 on immune cells facilitates adenosine clearance by binding to ADA (Fig. 3\n). There are two isoforms of ADA, ADA1 and ADA2. ADA1 is ubiquitously expressed and present in cytosol as well as on the cell membrane. The primary role of ADA1 is to degrade adenosine and deoxyadenosine [122]. ADA2 is the predominant isoform found in plasma. Unlike ADA1, ADA2 possesses a much higher costimulatory activity than ADA1 [123] and has a much lower capacity to catalyze adenosine deamination [124].",

Interactions with these matrix components may play a role in sequestration of DPP4 and allow additional functions such as matrix remodeling, metastasis and chemotaxis.",

DPP4 expression in visceral adipose tissue increased in obese patients with a positive correlation between DPP4 levels and the degree of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). Further evidence suggests that APC-expressing DPP4 promotes T cell proliferation and activation independent of its catalytic activity as catalytic inhibition of DPP4 or addition of exogenous soluble DPP4 did not have such effect. In vitro co-culture experiments suggest that DPP4 on APCs is able to anchor ADA on the cell surface and modulates peri-cellular microenvironment through clearing adenosine [27].

Studies indicate that agonists of GLP-1, a substrate of DPP4, improve the outcome of cardiovascular disease. It has been suggested for some time that receptor for GLP-1 (GLP-1R) is expressed in cardiovascular cells including endothelial cells, cardiomyocytes and coronary smooth muscle cells [131]. GLP-1R belongs to G protein-coupled receptors. The engagement of GLP-1R leads to the activation of adenylate cyclase through stimulatory Gs subunit and subsequent accumulation of cAMP in classically responsive cells such as pancreatic \u03b2 cells [132], [133]. For example, in \u03b2 cell, the activation of GLP-1 activates PKA, which subsequently reduces Foxo1 and results in an increase of Foxa2. Foxa2 then increases PDX-1, an transcription factor for insulin [134], [135]. Via a cAMP-dependent pathway, GLP-1R signaling may also induce the activation of PI3K which further increases the expression of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, two antiapoptotic proteins [136].",

Exendin-4, a GLP-1R agonist, was also shown to stimulate proliferation of human coronary artery endothelial cells through eNOS-, PKA-, and PI3K/Akt-dependent pathways [139]. Both DPP4 inhibitor and GLP-1 can increase endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs), suggesting a role of GLP-1-dependent pathway in the development of EPCs [140], [141]. Moreover, GLP-1 can increase left ventricular developed pressure and coronary flow in isolated mouse hearts [142]. Further studies confirmed that the protective effect of GLP-1 on endothelial cells is mediated through increasing nitric oxide (NO) production [143].

            "text": "There are several large scale phase 3 or phase 4 clinical trials to assess the cardiovascular effect of DPP4 inhibitors. Those trials include EXAMINE (EXamination of cArdiovascular outcoMes with alogliptIN versus standard of carE in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and acute coronary syndrome) on alogliptin, TECOS (Trial Evaluating Cardiovascular Outcomes With Sitagliptin) on sitagliptin, the SAVOR-TIMI 53(Saxagliptin Assessment of Vascular Outcomes Recorded in Patients With Diabetes Mellitus-Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction 53 trial) on saxagliptin, and CAROLINA (Cardiovascular Outcome Study of Linagliptin Versus Glimepiride in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes) on linagliptin. Among those trials, EXAMINE and SAVOR-TIMI 53 were recently completed. In the EXAMINE study, 5380 diabetic patients with a recent (< 90 days) myocardial infarction or unstable angina requiring hospitalization were randomized to the treatment of alogliptin or placebo. The patients were followed for a period up to 40 months (a median of 18 months). Alogliptin treatment did not improve the outcome of primary endpoints including death from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and nonfatal stroke [8]. A total of 16,492 diabetic subjects with a history of MI, or documented atherosclerosis, or at least one of hypertension, smoking, or dyslipidemia and HbA1c 6.5\u201312% were recruited in the trial of SAVOR-TIMI 53 to evaluate the effect of saxagliptin on cardiovascular outcomes (a composite of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction or nonfatal ischemic stroke). The patients were randomized to saxagliptin group or placebo group. Additional anti-diabetic agents were prescribed throughout the study. Median follow-up time was 2.1 years and maximum was 2.9 years. No improvements in cardiovascular outcomes were observed in saxagliptin treatment group compared to placebo-treated patients. However, hospitalization rate for heart failure was higher in saxagliptin-treated subjects (3.5% vs. 2.8%; hazard ratio, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.07 to 1.51; P = 0.007) [7]. No differences in multiple safety endpoints (such as pancreatitis, cancer, and hypoglycemia) were observed across groups in both trials. These trials suggest that catalytic inhibition of DPP4 is basically safe from cardiovascular standpoint but also does not improve cardiovascular endpoints. There are several reasons for this discrepancy between these clinical trial results and previous reports that DPP4 inhibition possessed beneficial cardiovascular effect. One of the possible reasons is that the follow-up period of those trials is not long enough to observe the difference between treatment group and placebo group (Median follow-up periods were 1.5 years and 2.1 years for EXAMINE and SAVOR-TIMI 53 respectively). Another possible reason is that patients in both groups were receiving other anti-diabetic treatments throughout the study. The possible reason for this neutral effect on cardiovascular endpoints may involve other substrates of DPP4. As mentioned previously, the substrates of DPP4 include a variety of peptides. Those treatments might interfere with or cover the cardiovascular effects of DPP4 inhibition. Many of these substrates, such as SDF-1 and NPY, are implicated in diabetes and cardiovascular disease. However, it is also possible that catalytic inhibition alone is insufficient to improve cardiovascular outcomes.",

Alogliptin, a DPP4 inhibitor, but not GLP-1 induces eNOS and Akt phosphorylation (Ser1177 and Ser473 respectively) paralleled by a rapid increase in nitric oxide [144]. Inhibition of Src kinase decreased eNOS and Akt phosphorylation in response to alogliptin, in contrast to a lack of any effect on insulin mediated activation of the eNOS-Akt, suggesting that alogliptin mediates vasodilation through Src kinase mediated effects on eNOS-Akt.

SDF-1\u03b1, a well-studied substrate of DPP4, is a regulator of EPCs. By comparing four weeks of sitagliptin versus no additional treatment added to baseline metformin and/or sulfonylurea therapy in 32 diabetic patients, Fadini and coworkers demonstrated patients with DPP4 inhibition had a 2-fold increase of EPCs, 50% increase of SDF-1\u03b1 [145]. Animal hindlimb ischemia and myocardial infarction studies confirmed the promotive effect of DPP4 inhibition on vasculogenesis through SDF-1 [140], [146]. SDF-1 also mediates the homing and engraftment of progenitor cells in transplantation. Enzymatic inhibition or deletion of DPP4 greatly promotes the homing and engraftment of both mouse and human hematopoietic progenitor cells via a mechanism involving SDF-1 [147], [148], [149], [150]. Further study suggests that truncation of colony-stimulating factors (CSF) such as GM-CSF, G-CSF, erythropoietin, and IL-3 is also involved in DPP4-mediated regulation of progenitor cell homing and engraftment [69]. However, degradation of another substrate NPY(1\u201336) by DPP4 has been suggested to promote angiogenesis by enhancing the production of NPY(3\u201336). Both NPY(1\u201336) and NPY(3\u201336) have been shown to promote human umbilical endothelial cell migration in an endothelial wound assay [151]. Inhibition of DPP4 activity by a neutralizing antibody suppresses angiogenic activity of NPY(1\u201336) but not NPY(3\u201336), suggesting that the production of NPY(3\u201336) is required for angiogenic activity of NPY [151].",

            "text": "Another important mechanism by which DPP4 inhibition proffer cardiovascular benefits is through a reduction in inflammation. Inflammation plays an etiological role in the development and maintenance of cardiovascular disease [152]. DPP4 is also known as the T-cell antigen CD26. In addition to cardiovascular cells, DPP4 is also highly expressed on many inflammatory cells including T cells and monocytes, and regulates their biological processes and functions [48]. Both enzymatic and non-enzymatic functions of DPP4 play an important role in T cell activation. T cell activation can be blocked by enzymatic inhibition of DPP4 [153], [154]. Suppression of dipeptidase activity of DPP4 resulted in a reduced production of cytokines including IL-2, IL-10, IL-12, and IFN-\u03b3 by peripheral blood mononuclear cells and T cells [153], [155], [156]. TGF-\u03b21, an immunosuppressive cytokine, was shown to be up-regulated by DPP4 inhibition [155], [157], [158]. T cells transfected with mutant DPP4 devoid of enzymatic activity displayed reduced activation compared with that of transfected with wild-type DPP4 [159]. Consistent with that, the addition of soluble DPP4 promoted the recall antigen-induced proliferation of peripheral blood lymphocytes, while soluble DPP4 mutant without enzymatic activity did not, providing a direct evidence that enzymatic activity of DPP4 is involved in the T cell activation [160]. Other than its enzymatic activity, the non-enzymatic function of DPP4 is also important for T cell activation. DPP4 has been shown to be able to directly bind to several extracellular molecules such as ADA (adenosine deaminase), collagen and fibronectin [48]. Engagement of DPP4 by ADA or antibodies induces co-stimulatory signal and activates T-cell through interacting with CD45, a membrane-linked tyrosine phosphatase [77]. Following the activation of T cells, both the percentage of DPP4+ cells and the number of molecules per cell are elevated [71]. DPP4-induced T-cell activation requires TCR/CD3 complex. DPP4 engagement can induce cytotoxicity only in CD3-expressing clones but not CD3-negative clones [161]. Furthermore, down-regulation of CD3 by antibody pre-incubation markedly reduced DPP4-mediated T-cell proliferation [72]. The activation of DPP4 enhances the tyrosine phosphorylation of p56lck and \u03b6 chain in CD3 and induces IL-2 production [77], [162]. In addition, the phosphorylation of a range of intracellular proteins which are involved in the TCR/CD3 signaling, such as p56lck, p59fyn, ZAP-70, MAP kinase, c-Cbl, and phospholipase C\u03b3 was increased and prolonged by the cross-linking of DPP4 [78].",

Soluble DPP4 has been reported to be able to upregulate the expression of CD86 on APCs and thus enhance antigen presentation function [125]. Additional studies demonstrated that DPP4 directly binds caveolin-1 on the cell surface of APCs. The interaction between DPP4 and Caveolin-1 expressed on APCs mediates a signaling cascade in antigen loaded APCs, resulting in their activation [125], [126]. The binding of DPP4 to caveolin-1 induces its phosphorylation, which subsequently activates IRAK-1 and NF\u03baB [126]. Recently, we showed that DPP4 on macrophages and dendritic cells is important for their inflammatory function. By binding ADA, APC-expressing DPP4 provides a microenvironment suitable for T cell proliferation and enhances visceral adipose inflammation [27]. In addition to ADA and caveolin-1, DPP4 has been reported to bind multiple extracellular matrix components including collagen and fibronectin [24], [74], [163]. The interaction between DPP4 and the matrix may play a role in matrix remodeling, metastasis and chemotaxis.",
