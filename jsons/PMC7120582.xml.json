Due to an increase in application of human and veterinary medicines manyfold, pharmaceuticals and their metabolite residues have been found in rivers, sewage effluents, streams and in surface, ground, and potable water, creating a big concern for the ecologists [1]. The primary routes of entrance of pharmaceuticals into the environment are domestic, hospital, and industrial wastes [2]. Pharmaceuticals are excreted in urine or feces as a mixture of unchanged chemicals and metabolites and enter into the environment through septic tank and sewage systems [1]. On the other hand, ecotoxicity data of pharmaceuticals are available in the literature for less than 1 % of the drugs, and only a small number of pharmaceuticals and their residues have been subjected to risk assessment employing ecotoxicological tests.",

As a consequence, when pharmaceuticals and their unaltered metabolites enter into the environment by different means, they can affect humans as well as other living species. There are many drugs whose specific effects or modes of action are not well known, and they often produce effects through several modes of action. These distinguished features make pharmaceuticals dissimilar from others and this is the sole reason to assess the potential acute and chronic effects of pharmaceuticals in diverse environmental compartments. It is quite apparent that the toxic effects of pharmaceuticals on diverse organisms in aquatic as well as nonaquatic environment are due to their long persistent and bio-accumulative nature [4]. In view of the serious issue of pharmaceutical toxicity to the environment, it is vital to categorize the proper source, occurrence, effects, and fate of each individual pharmaceutical product as well as to perform the risk assessment and risk management of ecotoxicological effects of the pharmaceutical chemicals and their metabolites [1, 2].",

The world consumption of antibiotics has risen radically in the last decade, also increasing the elimination of their metabolites in their original form. Most antibiotics are poorly metabolized after ingestion, probably resulting in a fraction of antibiotics from 25 to 75 % leaving the bodies in an unaltered form after consumption [5]. Additionally, a high percentage of the antibiotics added to the animal feed are excreted in urine or manure. In some cases, as much as 90 % of the antibiotic administered orally may pass through the animal unchanged and excreted in urine and manure. Thereafter, these antibiotics can enter surface and groundwater and be strongly adsorbed in soils and are not readily degradable [6]. Vidaver [7] estimates that 53,000 ha of fruit and vegetable plants are sprayed annually with antibiotics. For example, streptomycin and oxytetracycline are registered by the US Environment Protection Agency (USEPA) for use in plant agriculture. Utilization of transgenic plants to produce inexpensive antibiotics may also be a cause of environmental hazards due to the existence of crop residues, roots, and root exudates in the soil which can act as a continuous source of residual antibiotics to soil fauna and flora [8].",

According to a nationwide study of \u201cemerging pollutants\u201d in waters, the US Geological Survey (USGS) tested for pharmaceuticals in 139 rivers in 30 states of the USA, detecting diverse therapeutic classes of biologically active compounds [10]. The cardiovascular drug propranolol has been reported downstream from the sewage treatment plant [11]. The antiepileptic drugs carbamazepine and clofibrate are two most persistent pharmaceuticals which have been detected in the environment [2]. Major detected drugs in rivers were beta blockers (e.g., metoprolol up to 1.54 \u03bcg/l) and beta-sympathomimetics, estrogens (e.g., 17\u03b2-estradiol up to 0.013 \u03bcg/l) [12], analgesic and anti-inflammatory drugs (e.g., Diclofenac up to 1.2 \u03bcg/l) [13], and also antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin up to 1.7 \u03bcg/l) [12], as well as lipid-lowering agents (e.g., clofibrinic acid up to 0.2 \u03bcg/l) [14] and antiepileptic drugs (e.g., carbamazepine up to 2.1 \u03bcg/l) [13]. Presence of clofibric acid, propylphenazone, and diclofenac has been reported in the drinking water of Berlin in the concentration range of several hundreds of nanograms per liter [15]. Paracetamol, diclofenac, and carbamazepine were monitored in drinking water in Southern France [16], and clofibric acid and diazepams were detected in treated drinking water in Milan, Italy [17]. Psychoactive and illicit drugs amphetamine, cocaine and its metabolite benzoylecgonine, morphine, 6-acetylmorphine, 11-nor-9-carboxy-delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol, methadone and its main metabolite 2-ethylidene-1,5-dimethyl-3,3-diphenylpyrrolidine have been detected in surface and waste waters [18]. Schultz and Furlong found highest concentrations of antidepressant drugs venlafaxine, citalopram, and bupropion 1000 \u00b1 400 ng/l, 90 \u00b1 20 ng/l, and 60 \u00b1 40 ng/l, respectively, in samples collected downstream from a water reclamation plant [19]. The maximum determined concentration of fluoxetine was 0.099 ng/l in wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents in Canada [20].",

Therefore, it is acknowledged that a prioritization technique needs to be developed for environmental risk assessment of pharmaceuticals, and this should follow the general scheme for chemicals according to the REACH guidelines [27], where the implication of in silico methods specifically the quantitative structure\u2013activity relationship (QSAR) method is stressed.",

Computer-aided toxicity models allow for the effects of pharmaceuticals (physicochemical properties, toxicological activity, distribution, fate, etc.) to be easily predicted. These predictions may be obtained from the knowledge of chemical structure alone, provided that the structure can be described in two or three dimensions. Employing these methods, ecotoxicity information on pharmaceuticals may be obtained without toxicity testing, and/or even before synthesis of the compound. Therefore, use of QSAR as one of the non-experimental methods is significant in order to lessen time, animal usage and cost involvement in design, development, and discovery process of drugs and/or pharmaceuticals.",

            "text": "Identification of proper sources and routes of entry of pharmaceuticals into diverse environmental compartments is the first step to get a proper view of the ecotoxicity problem due to pharmaceuticals. The most obvious and common pathways for environmental contamination of pharmaceuticals are discussed below.\nUrine and feces: Major and most common entry routes for pharmaceuticals into the environment are via urine and feces of the patients. Not only active ingredients, but also the metabolites are excreted through the urine and feces as many drugs are metabolized into hydrophilic compounds for excretion. The risk of these metabolites is completely different from the parent drugs in majority of cases which make the risk assessment study more critical one.\nDirect exposure of diagnostic compounds: Contrast media like diatrizoate, iohexol, iomeprol, and iopromide are used as diagnostic tools for capturing detailed X-ray images of soft tissues. Iodinated X-ray contrast media are highly hydrophilic substances which are extensively applied and eliminated without proper treatment; as a result they persist for a long time in the environment [32].\nHousehold disposal: Either out-of-date or unwanted medicines are discarded through the sink/toilet or via waste collection, before being taken to landfill sites where they appear as terrestrial ecosystem contaminants. Less than 20 % users had ever been given instructions about medication dumping by a health care provider. In a study, causes for possessing unused medication were found to be due to an alteration of medication by the doctor (48.9 %), or self-discontinuation (25.8 %) [33]. The most common method of disposal was to throw unused medicines in the trash (76.5 %) or flush them down the drain (11.2 %) [33].\nManufacturers: According to the regulation of the Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP), the active pharmaceutical emissions during manufacturing have been thought to be insignificant. But recently it has been found that in Asian countries concentrations up to several milligrams per liter can be found in effluents for single compounds [34].\nHospital influent and effluent: Point sources such as hospital effluents are likely to be another significant source. There are up to 16 pharmaceuticals including antiepileptics and anti-inflammatories which were found in the hospital waste water according to a study [35]. Several studies suggested the existence of the pharmaceuticals in the effluent and influent of the sewage treatment plants and it was proved that the elimination of the pharmaceuticals is partial [35].\nAnimal husbandry and veterinary medicine: Veterinary medicines and their metabolites are also excreted through urine and feces. Apart from the potential for direct soil contamination, there is also the risk of run-off with heavy rain, thus potentially contaminating both the surrounding surface and groundwater. Other sources include direct application in aqua farming, manure run-off, run-off from the application of sewage sludge and manure on farmland as fertilizers, or, finally, via landfill leaching [36].\nAquaculture: Sewage Treatment Plant (STP) sludge is habitually employed as fertilizer on agricultural land which is a rich source of non-suspected drugs [37]. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), antibiotics have been utilized in aquaculture primarily for therapeutic purposes and as prophylactic agents. Antibiotics authorized for use in aquaculture are florfenicol, oxytetracycline, sarafloxacin, premix, erythromycin sulfonamides potentiated with ormethoprim, or trimethoprim [38].\nPlant agriculture: Antibiotics are comprehensively employed to control bacterial diseases of plants. Streptomycin with oxytetracycline to a minor extent is very commonly used antibiotic in plant agriculture in controlling bacterial diseases of tree fruits. Primary uses are on apple, pear, and related fruit trees for the control of fire blight caused by Erwinia amylovora. According to a report, antibiotics applied to plants account for less than 0.5 % of total antibiotic use in the USA [39]. In Fig. 1, we have represented different sources, routes, fate of pharmaceuticals.\n\n",

NSAIDs have the higher concentrations recorded in surface water, ranging between 0.4 ng/l and 15 \u03bcg/l, diclofenac, paracetamol, and ibuprofen being the most quantitatively found [70]. Drugs like caffeine with a maximum concentration of 6 \u03bcg/l and sulfamethoxazole with 1.9 \u03bcg/l in the USA, carbamazepine up to 1.3 \u03bcg/l in Germany and in Canada, gemfibrozil up to 790 ng/l, ranitidine up to 580 ng/l, atenolol with 241 ng/l in Italy, and metformin up to 150 ng/l are detected in surface water [71]. In the effluent of WWTP and STP, the concentrations of estrogenic compounds usually are below 50 ng/l, but there are unexpected high concentrations of estriol and 17\u03b1-estradiol (about 590 ng/l and 180 ng/l respectively) found in the USA [72].",

Extensive studies have detected tetracyclines and sulfonamides in liquid manure at concentrations of up to 20 and 40 mg/l, respectively. Antibiotics like virginiamycin, sarafloxacin, tetracycline, oxytetracycline, chlortetracycline, and cyclosporine A have quite slow biodegradability in soil. Tylosin disappeared soon after the application of manure. Hamscher et al. [74] detected tetracycline and chlortetracycline in 10 out of 12 soil samples.

The inhibition of wastewater bacteria may seriously affect organic matter degradation and nitrification process which is a vital step in wastewater purification and elimination of toxic ammonia [77]. Lincomycin showed significant inhibition of the nitrification activity [78]. Ciprofloxacin was found to be active against Vibrio fischeri at a concentration of 5 mg/l [79]. Thomulka and McGee [80] have performed two bioassays to evaluate the toxicity of antibiotics like novobiocin, chloramphenicol, tetracycline, ampicillin, and streptomycin to Vibrio harveyi, and approximately no toxic effects were identified after short incubation times where the employed endpoint was luminescence. Common receptors have been identified in plants for a number of antibiotics affecting transcription and translation (tetracyclines, macrolides, lincosamides, aminoglycosides, and pleuromutilins), metabolic pathways such as folate biosynthesis (sulfonamides), chloroplast replication (fluoroquinolones), and fatty acid biosynthesis (triclosan) [81].",

Strong inhibitory effects on several bacteria and diminution in the length of the hyphae of lively molds in forest soil have been observed when antibiotics are added in concentrations of 10 mg/kg soil. A transitory effect on sulfate reduction was detected when antibiotics were mixed to sediment [83]. Allergic risks may arise from the high exposure of antibiotics dust particle in the air. Tylosin and sulfamethazine, which occurred in 80 % and 65 % of the samples respectively, are drugs with known allergic potential. Therefore, the high incidence of the asthma disease occurred among children living on farms. A survey on dust in pig fattening buildings in Europe exposed an average concentration of inhalable airborne dust of 2.2 mg/m3 [84]. Chloramphenicol is extensively employed in farming resulting in severe hazardous effects including myelosuppression to farmers; that is why it was totally banned for food-producing animals within the EU and the USA in 1994 [85].",

Only in Germany, in 2002, 93.5 million prescriptions for NSAIDs were made with a transaction volume of about 1562 million Euros [88]. Due to higher usage and pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties, analgesics and anti-inflammatory drugs can reach considerable (up to >1 \u03bcg/l) concentrations in the environment.

Diclofenac is commonly found in wastewater at median concentration of 0.81 \u03bcg/l whereas the maximal concentration in wastewater and surface water is up to 2 \u03bcg/l [90]. Acetylsalicylic acid affected reproduction in D. magna and D. longispina at concentrations of 1.8 mg/l [90]. Water flea Daphnia magna population growth rate was considerably reduced for concentrations ranging from 0 to 80 mg/l due to chronic toxicity of ibuprofen. Acute toxicity tests showed that naproxen had LC50 and EC50 values within the 1\u2013100 mg/l range for the water flea Ceriodaphnia dubia, the rotifer Brachionus calyciflorus, and the fairy shrimp Thamnocephalus platyurus.

Acute toxicity of methotrexate is reported on highly proliferative species like the ciliate Tetrahymena pyriformis [EC50 (48 h) = 45 mg/l] [104]. On the contrary, cyclophosphamide appears to have a little effect on them. Methotrexate has been shown to have no or little effect on certain protozoans including Toxoplasma gondii, Babesia bovis, and Leishmania tropica, perhaps as they have different mechanisms of drug metabolism [105].

Sertraline exhibits highly toxic properties to rainbow trout (LC50 of 0.38 mg/l) at a 96-h exposure [109]. SSRIs were also tested on algae by evaluating the growth inhibition induced. Chronic toxicity tests proved that the organisms were sensitive with NOEC values below 1 mg/l [110]. C. vulgaris was shown to be the least sensitive species for all SSRIs tested.

Diazepam and carbamazepine (antiepileptics) are classified as potentially detrimental to aquatic organisms as most of the acute toxicity data are below 100 mg/l. Conventional toxicity studies showed chronic toxicity of carbamazepine in C. dubia [NOEC (7 days) = 25 \u03bcg/l], in the rotifer B. calyciflorus [NOEC (2 days) = 377 \u03bcg/l], and in early life stages of zebrafish [NOEC (10 days) = 25 mg/l] [94]. Carbamazepine is carcinogenic to rats but does not have mutagenic properties in mammals [113]. It is also lethal to zebrafish at the 43 \u03bcg/l level and produces sublethal changes in Daphnia sp. at 92 \u03bcg/l [113]. Growth of D. magna was inhibited for concentrations of carbamazepine above 12.7 mg/l, showing acute toxicity at 17.2 mg/l [113].",

Exposure of mammalian hosts infected with the blood trematode S. mansoni to contraceptive pills resulted in a noteworthy modification in a range of liver cell\u2019s ultrastructure and function. Ethinylestradiol (EE2) is a synthetic estrogen found in oral contraceptive pills with noticeable estrogenic effects in fish. The life-cycle exposure of fathead minnows to EE2 concentrations below 1 ng/l produced a noteworthy decline in fertilization success, an increased egg production and decreased expression of secondary male sex characteristics. Life-long exposure of zebrafish to 5 ng/l to EE2 has led to reproductive failure due to the nonexistence of secondary male sex characteristics [63]. Exposure to 17\u03b2-estradiol caused an increased susceptibility to the protozoan T. gondii in mice, while increased pathology occurred in mammals infected with Leishmania mexicana amazonensis and exposed to either estradiol or testosterone [114]. Estradiol increased the susceptibility of cyprinids to hemoflagellates by the suppression of lymphocyte proliferation [115]. At relatively high concentrations, hydrocortisone can cause an increase in the intensity of ectoparasitic infections in fish.",

Tamiflu tablet largely dominated Relenza (disk inhaler) due to its relative ease of administration. Tamiflu is a prodrug, which is converted to the active drug oseltamivir carboxylate (OC) in the liver. About 80 % of an oral dose of Tamiflu is excreted as OC in the urine and the remaining portions are excreted as OP in the feces. Therefore, both the parent chemical and its bioactive metabolite eventually are projected to reach a mean of 2\u201312 mg/l in WWTPs during a moderate and severe pandemic [122]. Current evidences suggested that rivers receiving WWTP effluent would also be exposed to OC throughout a pandemic.

New extrapolation complications are dose extrapolation of molecular and cellular pathway responses, and extrapolation from the short-term in vitro to longer term in vivo exposure. In vitro to in vivo extrapolation and physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models are amenable to sensitivity, variability, and uncertainty analysis employing conventional tools [130]. Computational biology systems will back the application of tools for determining variability and uncertainty from the pharmacologically based pharmacokinetics (PBPK) information as the pathway components imitate more targeted molecular elements and their interactions [131].",

Analyzing the models, the authors concluded that heteroatom atom count and charge distribution were significant determinants of the rodent toxicity, and that the atom level log P contributions of various structural fragments and various extended topochemical atom (ETA) indices reflecting electronic information and branching pattern of molecules were important determinants for the rodent toxicity. In addition, from interspecies aquatic toxicity modeling, it was established that apart from the algae toxicity, atom level log P contributions of different fragments, charge distribution, shape, and ETA parameters were important in describing the daphnia and fish toxicities in the interspecies correlation models with algae toxicity.

Due to the limited availability of the in silico models on ecotoxicity of pharmaceuticals, there is a need to develop more in silico models in order to reduce time and cost involvement as well as reduction of animal usage in getting relevant data and for better and fast risk assessment of pharmaceuticals. It is not possible to experimentally study toxic effects of each pharmaceutical in different species. Most active pharmaceutical ingredients have available rodent toxicity information. As a result, if this data could be extrapolated or modeled to different other species, this would be a noteworthy resource for prioritization of pharmaceuticals with regards to diverse environment hazards. However, very limited papers have been published on interspecies models to predict environmental toxicity for pharmaceuticals, and there are relatively few statistical models available to bridge the chronic toxicity data information gap [168, 169].",

This makes expert system a more convenient option for toxicity prediction over traditional QSARs. Expert systems have been frequently employed by regulatory agencies, academia and industries worldwide for more efficient and fast prediction. The foremost criterion of toxicity prediction is to differentiate between toxicologically active and inactive molecules. Multiple mechanisms can lead to the identical toxic effect and this intricacy requires the accessibility of predictive tools that are able to discriminate manifold regions in the activity space. This necessitates the development of so-called expert systems, which try to cover broader structural and activity regions in comparison to the local models.

The principles of green chemistry state that the functionality of a chemical should not only comprise the properties of a chemical essential for its application, but also quick and trouble free degradability after its usage. Improvement of synthesis and renewable feedstock are very important issues for preparation of environment friendly pharmaceuticals. Employing these principles and the awareness of green chemistry to pharmaceuticals are necessary [138]. In this perspective, a system called \u201cbenign by design\u201d can be considered which means easy degradability after application is considered even before a pharmaceutical\u2019s synthesis. This approach is not completely new. For instance, it is a general practice during the development of pharmaceuticals that adverse side effects are to be taken into consideration. This can also result in economic rewards in the long run and will fit into green pharmacy [170]. But one has to note that a pharmaceutical may also lose its specific therapeutic action due to the structural modification while introducing green chemistry. However, this approach can be employed at least for the optimized and new synthesis routes [170]. Again, it is true that finding good lead compounds is a major task even without considering the environment toxicity issue. However, there is no requirement to find a new lead compound at first. The modification of known lead structures can be the best option to do. Responding to the green and justifiable pharmacy challenge may also result in new marketing opportunities with help of appropriate and scientific research within industry and academia.",

There is still a huge need of filling the missing data gaps in our knowledge. Due to biologically active and persistence nature of pharmaceuticals, they are one of the most serious threats to human health and environment stability. Additionally, their specific modes of action and specific effects on living systems make pharmaceuticals distinctly different from other chemicals. This sole feature is sufficient reason to assess the potential effects of pharmaceuticals in diverse environmental compartments. The problem is more horrifying as the occurrence level of pharmaceuticals in different environmental compartments is largely varied. The variations in drug occurrences from country to country and also within the different regions of a country make the assessment of pharmaceuticals a troublesome job for the environmental scientist. The interactions between pharmaceuticals and natural stressors of aquatic and terrestrial communities remain to be unexplained. Along with that, the proper risk assessment of mixtures of pharmaceutical products is another area where more introspection is required in present times.",

It is also important to assess the presence of pharmaceuticals and their metabolites and transformation products in several environmental compartments. One can find only a few reports on the quantitative effects of pharmaceuticals, but the effects of metabolites are not sufficiently explored by the scientific community. One has to accept that the identification of risk assessment and management are not sufficient if they are not properly implemented in right way. In these perspectives, the major role should be played by government authorities and agencies by implementing various guidelines and rules for the reduction of toxicity of pharmaceuticals to the environment.",

Hence, a sufficient number of models should be developed to address the risk assessment and risk management in an efficient way by minimizing the requirement of time, animal testing and cost. This will also help in gathering the ecotoxicity data as soon as a new pharmaceutical product comes to the market. In this perspective, expert systems are more reliable and results may be easily available in no time. There is a need of more expert systems for prediction of toxicity of pharmaceuticals from diverse classes of therapeutic actions and their metabolites against different endpoints.
