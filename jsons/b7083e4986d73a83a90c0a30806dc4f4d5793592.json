            "text": "Non-viral gene delivery to skeletal muscle was one of the first applications of gene therapy that went into the clinic, mainly because skeletal muscle is an easily accessible tissue for local gene transfer and non-viral vectors have a relatively safe and low immunogenic track record. However, plasmid DNA, naked or complexed to the various chemistries, turn out to be moderately efficient in humans when injected locally and very inefficient (and very toxic in some cases) when injected systemically. A number of clinical applications have been initiated however, based on transgenes that were adapted to good local impact and/or to a wide physiological outcome (i.e., strong humoral and cellular immune responses following the introduction of DNA vaccines). Neuromuscular diseases seem more challenging for non-viral vectors. Nevertheless, the local production of therapeutic proteins that may act distantly from the injected site and/or the hydrodynamic perfusion of safe plasmids remains a viable basis for the non-viral gene therapy of muscle disorders, cachexia, as well as peripheral neuropathies.",

Conversely, the treatment of hereditary neuromuscular diseases is particularly challenging for non-viral vectors. Among issues are as follows: (1) the size of the muscle tissue, which represents half of the total mass of the organism, (2) the poor accessibility of profound muscles or peripheral nerves, and (3) the progressive tissue remodeling along the natural history of some muscle diseases with active processes of necrosis/regeneration and fibrosis/lipidosis. S. Braun (*) AFM-Telethon, Evry Cedex, France e-mail: sbraun@afm-telethon.fr On the other hand, non-viral vectors do bear interesting advantages over recombinant viruses. Non-viral vectors are made of plasmid DNA, naked or complexed to a variety of versatile molecules such as cationic lipids or polymers. They are (1) well characterized, and their structure can be fine-tuned [3] , and (2) mostly nonimmunogenic provided, they are not carrying protein motifs. This allows repeated administrations for chronic diseases, (3) comparatively easy to produce at a large scale [4] , (4) less limited by size constraints, leaving the potential to deliver widetype genetic material, as large as 100 kb [5] (this is far beyond the size of coding sequences such as the dystrophin cDNA for Duchenne muscular dystrophy), and non-viral vectors (5) can remain functional for a long period of time in skeletal muscles [6] . Episomal plasmid DNA can persist for life in rodents and for many years in larger animals if they are delivered into low turnover tissues, including the brain and spinal cord, heart, or muscle (for review see [7] ).",

The principle is based on the self-assembly of supramolecular complexes, often through electrostatic interactions between the positively charged vectors and the DNA negatively charged phosphate residues [9] . In these complexes, DNA is condensed and compacted and is less exposed to nuclease degradation. Among these, cationic lipid-and polymerbased systems have been the most extensively studied [10] [11] [12] . In early studies, DNA was encapsulated in neutral or anionic liposomes without changing the structures of the liposomes [9, 13] . The ratio between the cationic charge of the liposome and the negative charge of the DNA usually controls the size of complexes [14] , typically in the range of 200 nm to 2 \u03bcm quasi-spherical particles with an ordered (often multilamellar) organization. Their positive total charge enables them of efficiently interacting with the negative residues of the cell membranes and internalizing into the cell, which occurs mainly through the endocytosis pathway [10, 15].",

Vectors must be small enough (less than 500 nm) to cross through vascular endothelial cells and gain access to surrounding tissues [16] . Furthermore, they should also be designed so that they can be ignored In contrast to viral vectors, non-viral gene transfer is not elicited to a large extent by active intake processes. Therefore, a sophisticated vector may be needed to facilitate the cellular uptake and appropriate intracellular processing of the transgene. Significant developments in artificial complexes combined different functions for improved gene transfer. Many cationic liposomes are normally accompanied by a neutral lipid such as dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine (DOPE) or cholesterol. DOPE is frequently useful because it can fuse with other lipids when exposed to a low pH, as in endosomes, which triggers the release of the associated DNA into the cytosol [27] . Other popular modifications use ligand binding to PEG. Various targeting approaches have been investigated, including incorporation of peptides, antibodies, and sugar into the lipid vesicles to facilitate tissue targeting (for review see [28] ). However, the association of all of these components results in complex structures that require thorough formulation and galenic studies.",

Addition of a fusogenic helper lipid such as DOPE facilitates the formation of a destabilizing hexagonal phase with the endosome membrane and enhances gene expression by promoting the release of DNA from the endosomal compartment ( Fig. 9 .1 and [31] ).",

            "text": "A number of therapeutic concepts have been explored in humans using more or less refined non-viral gene delivery systems in the view of therapies for genetic disorders and of immunologic disorders. As of today, despite a number of very sophisticated chemistries, non-viral vectors were not completely satisfactory in transferring genes to muscle tissues following systemic administration. Many complexes show excellent transfection activity in cell culture, but most do not perform well in the presence of serum, and only a few are active in vivo [35] . They remain at least 3 logs of magnitude less effective than viral vectors. Therapeutic doses require high concentrations of complexes. Besides the relatively large size of many synthetic vectors (often above 150 nm), the main obstacles in the use of synthetic complexes via systemic delivery are their aggregation, instability, toxicity, and , including negatively charged naked plasmid DNA (or polynucleotides) delivered either directly or combined with physical methods (ultrasound, electroporation) or complexed with various chemical entities such as cationic lipids or polymers. (b) Uptake pathways involve either fusion with the muscle cell membrane-, receptor-, clathrin-, caveolae-, or pinocytosis-dependent endocytosis. This is followed by endosome formation, escape from endosome, degradation, nuclear import of the plasmid DNA/polynucleotide, and transgene expression propensity to be captured by the mononuclear phagocyte system, leading to their rapid clearance by phagocytic cells in the liver, spleen, lungs, and bone marrow. These particles readily aggregate as their concentration increases. Toxicity is often linked to the colloidal instability of synthetic vectors resulting from interactions with molecules in biological fluids, leading to large aggregates. These aggregates, which are generally ineffective gene delivery agents, can be absorbed onto the surface of circulating red blood cells, or embolized in microvasculatures, preventing them from reaching the intended target cells. This opsonization process can also activate the complement system, one of the innate immune mechanisms against \"foreign\" particles within the bloodstream, which in turn activates the phagocytosis and initiates an inflammatory response [7, 19, 36] . Skeletal muscles possess poorly permeable, tight endothelial (maybe less in the case of chronically inflamed tissues) layers and a highly regulated microcirculation [37] . The implication is that one would not expect particulate systems to be distributed easily from the blood circulation to skeletal muscles. Thus, the prospects for non-viral particulate vector widespread distribution from the systemic circulation are limited at present. Only one systemic delivery attempt was initiated in a neuromuscular disease indication. This was in hereditary inclusion body myopathy in a single patient intravenously perfused with a lipoplex in a compassionate trial. The patient showed signs of increase of sialic acid-related proteins and stabilization in the decline of muscle strength [38] .",

However this approach remains hampered by the diffusion limitations and immune cell clearance in the interstitial region of the target organ. Indeed, transgene expression following direct intramuscular needle delivery of complexes is often localized in regions that are close to the injection site. This implies that the dispersion of colloidal particles within muscle is a critical issue, and there is a need for basic studies of the effect of formulation on dispersion within solid tissues such as skeletal muscle. Nevertheless this poor efficiency remains compatible with applications that require only low levels of the therapeutic proteins, such as genetic vaccines, cancer, or peripheral limb ischemia (Table 9 .1).",

However, virally derived promoters, such as the CMV promoter, may not be suitable for applications to chronic diseases, as illustrated by the negative impact of inflammatory cytokines (interferon-\u03b3 or tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1) [41] . Thus, muscle-specific alternatives to the CMV promoter have been proposed, such as the desmin promoter/enhancer, which controls expression of the cytoskeletal protein desmin [42] or the creatine kinase promoter [43] .

Artificial systems for the control of genes are based on two elements: a chimeric transcription factor responding to a small inducer or even electric field and an artificial promoter composed of multiple binding sites for the transcription factor followed by a minimal promoter. Inducible gene expression systems use endogenous elements that respond to exogenous signals or stress, such as cytokines, heat, metal ions, and hypoxia. However, neither muscle-specific nor inducible promoters in the absence of induction are devoid of leaky activity [44] . If hypomethylated bacterial CpG sequences are maintained on the plasmid DNA backbone or promoter elements, a T helper 1 (Th1) immune response (but only for a short period and with no induction of anti-DNA antibodies) can be generated which may however be advantageous in view of genetic vaccination, alone or in priming-boost regimens with viral vectors [45] .",

In the later case, local gene delivery to focal lesions in the peripheral vasculature, for the production of highly active hormones, is ideally suited to the use of intramuscular or percutaneous vector delivery. In humans, intramuscular injections of naked plasmid encoding angiogenic factors (such as VEGF165 or HGF) were used in small numbers of patients with critical limb ischemia and did demonstrate promising clinical efficacy for the treatment of peripheral arterial disease. Ischemic pain and ischemic ulcers in the affected limb were relieved or markedly improved in further trials ( [49] and Table 9 .1). Importantly, all those plasmid-based preclinical and clinical trials resulted in a very good safety record ([50] and Table 9 .1). A meta-analysis of 12 clinical trials (1494 patients total) of local administration of pro-angiogenic growth factors (VEGF, FGF, HGF, Del-1, HIF-1alpha) using plasmid or viral gene transfer by intra-arterial or intramuscular injections showed that, despite promising results in single studies, no clear benefit could be identified in peripheral artery disease patients, irrespective of disease severity [51] .",

The pulse parameters and the type of material used (i.e., needle versus externally applied plate electrodes) are of critical importance [44] . Selective electro-sonoporation in a defined area using microbubble contrast agents showed increased plasmid-VEGF165 delivery in skeletal muscle allowing therapeutic angiogenesis in chronically ischemic skeletal muscles with undetectable tissue damage [56].

The endothelium in muscle is continuous and non-fenestrated, showing low permeability to macromolecules, including plasmid DNA. The hydrodynamic pressure induces extravasation of the injected DNA, probably by expanding the endothelium and thereby making pores accessible for DNA entry. The mechanism of plasmid DNA uptake by the muscle cells is still not clear and may involve both low-affinity receptor-mediated and nonspecific processes [1, 61] . The procedure safety is supported by a large body of data collected in mice, rats, dogs, and nonhuman primates. The edema caused by the injected fluid is resolved within 24 h and even the minimal signs of observed muscle toxicity clear within 2 weeks postinjection [62, 63] . The hind limb perfusion procedure is a rather quick and simple technique, which may be applied to chronic diseased muscles [64] or other chronic diseases such as anemia [65] . Based on successful preclinical studies using the mdx mouse and golden retriever muscular dystrophy (GRMD) dog models of Duchenne muscular dystrophy, and the positive (expression -though very low-, and safety) outcome of a phase I trial of intramuscular injection of MyoDys \u00ae , a full-length dystrophin plasmid, in Duchenne patients (the first completed gene transfer clinical trial in neuromuscular diseases) [66], the ground was set for a human clinical trial using MyoDys \u00ae into the forearm of Duchenne patients. A dose escalation study of single-limb perfusion with 0.9% saline was carried out in nine adults with muscular dystrophies under intravenous analgesia. The study led by Fan et al. demonstrated feasibility and safety up to 35% of limb volume in the upper extremities of the young adults with muscular dystrophy. Perfusion at 40% limb volume was associated with short-lived physiological changes in peripheral nerves without clinical correlates in one subject [67] . This study used lower cuff pressures than in our nonhuman primate studies (310-325 mm Hg vs. 450-700 mm Hg in nonhuman primates) [68, 69] . From our studies in the mdx mouse and GRMD dog models of Duchenne dystrophy, and in nonhuman primates, the minimal volume needed for efficient naked DNA limb perfusion is 40% of the limb volume [70] . Whereas arterial limb perfusion did not turn out to be safe in GRMD dogs (personal data not shown), up to ten consecutive naked DNA limb perfusions every other day appeared very safe in both dystrophic mice and dogs. Even though head-to-head comparison would be necessary, our studies suggested that gene transfer was higher in diseased muscles than in wild-type animals. We also noticed that the highest transfection efficiencies were found in nonhuman primates; up to 40% of limb muscles expressed reporter genes following a single-limb perfusion [68] . Therefore, limb perfusion of a naked DNA remains a valid approach to treat limb dystrophic muscles as an alternative to viral vectors in seropositive patients or in indications that require large transgenes with regional gene transfer [71] .",

Human artificial chromosome (HAC) vectors have the capacity to carry large genomic loci and to replicate and segregate autonomously without integration into the host genome. HAC vectors containing the entire human dystrophin gene (DYS-HAC) with its native regulatory elements allow dystrophin expression at levels similar to native dystrophin isoform expression levels. Since they can be stably maintained as episomal elements in host cells, the DYS-HAC could be introduced into several types of patient stem or progenitor cells for ex vivo therapy, e.g., induced pluripotent stem cells, mesoangioblasts, AC133, and mesenchymal stem cells [72] . One of the main issues, however, is the translatability of stem cell therapy in muscle disorders [73, 74] .",

Another limitation with systemic gene delivery of complexes is their rapid clearance by the reticuloendothelial system or their entrapment within small capillaries leading to the accumulation within especially lung tissue[20]. This limitation can be improved by incorporating polyethylene glycol (PEG) lipids, leading to increased circulation time of the complex, and protein expression in distal tissues[21, 22]. The negatively charged components of the cell membrane (glycoproteins, proteoglycans, and glycerophosphates) are able to interact with the positively charged systems triggering the non-specific endocytosis of cationic non-viral vectors. Increasing positive net charge, prolongation of the incubation time, or complex concentration can improve cell uptake by clathrin-mediated endocytosis of cationic lipids such as DOTAP/ DNA or of cationic polymers such as PEI/DNA by clathrin-coated pits or potocyto-",
