All clinical settings, including rehabilitative and infirmary setting, have actively involved in fighting against the infection. The intent of this paper was to reflect on the SARS precautionary measures that had been taken in a severe intellectual disabilities hospital in Hong Kong. Methods A review on six SARS precautionary measures were conducted. They were assessment of risk, formulation of operational guidelines, implementation of infection control measures, education and training of staff, conducting audits and carrying out environmental improvement work. Results Patients were at risk of getting infected from carers, visitors, volunteers, and staff and patients of general hospitals. A SARS Quarantine Unit, isolation ward, was opened to isolate patients who might have had close contact with SARS patients during a stay in a general hospital or when they returned from home leave. Undoubtedly, both staff and relatives participated in preventing the patients from being infected. No day leave and home leave was reported and the number of hospitalization in general hospital was decreased during the critical period. Three infection control audits were conducted and improvement work was carried out subsequently. Conclusion The practice of grouping within a standard isolation room is recommended to continue in the future. Moreover, intensive infection control training for all staff is of highest importance to safeguard the health of both staff and patient.",

To prevent patients picking up infection from carers, visitors and patients of general hospitals, to which they might be transferred temporarily for medical problem, outside hospital activities like outings and activities that involved volunteers and relatives were suspended since March. Relatives were advised to suspend taking the patients out for home leave temporarily. An isolation ward -SARS Quar-antine Unit, was established to accommodate patients who had close contact with SARS patients or returned from a general hospital or from home leave on \uf732\uf739 April \uf732\uf730\uf730\uf733 . The ward area was divided into clean, warm and hot zones. Clean zone was the area that patients would not enter while the warm zone was the area that patient might occasionally visited. The area that patient would frequently access was the hot zone such as the dormitory. To operate the unit, a work force was formed and staff were deployed from other wards and unit to deliver \uf732\uf734 -h care there.

Inadequate handwashing between procedures were observed occasionally. Some supporting staff were confused about the strengths of disinfectant. On the spot coaching was then given by the auditors. The second audit revealed that infection control facilities were inadequate in some departments, and improvement work was carried out ultimately. The third audit was conducted in the isolation ward and one low risk ward. One hundred per cent staff of the isolation ward and \uf738\uf733% staff of the low risk ward reflected that periodical discussions on infection issues were held in the workplace, but at irregular intervals. One hundred per cent staff in the isolation ward reported that they found the information useful. For the low risk area, nurses found the information useful while the supporting staff found it fairly useful. Nevertheless, staff of both wards were able to identify satisfactorily those high risk procedures to which they would be exposed. It was still noticed that handwashing before and after each care procedure was occasionally inadequate. However, it was observed that staff of both wards had satisfactory performance on environmental cleansing especially in the disinfection of lavatories.",

Infection control is a concern that staff has been facing in delivering care to patients with ID (Lakhani & Bates \uf731\uf739\uf739\uf739) . Actually they were in a state of anxiety. In one way they were afraid of being infected. In the other way, they scared about any outbreak that would be occurred in the hospital that would pose a great challenge for them to manage the situation. Individuals with severe ID are at a higher risk of becoming infected with various communicable diseases than the general population as many of them have difficulties in following commands or achieving independent living skills. Few of them are able to fit or wear a surgical mask properly. If an infection establish a foothold in a hospital, cross-infection will probably occur.",

They were not only worried that they would be infected; they also worried about cross-infection that might be happened to their family members. Thus they concerned very much about knowledge and skill on isolation precautions such as gown up and degown procedures. Therefore they regarded infection control training highly essential. Nevertheless, with dedication, they still continued working in the isolation ward throughout the battle. Staff working in low risk areas concerned more about room ventilation. Some of them expressed a feeling of inadequacy in fighting against SARS. It was assured if they could successfully protect all the patients from being infected; they had already contributed to the prevention and control of SARS in Hong Kong.",

It is no doubt that decreasing contact with the family or community will affect their quality of life. Yet, the risk of contracting an infection would be increased if there is an outbreak of infection occurred in the community. Taking into consideration of the risk and benefits they will be facing, reducing their contact with society temporarily to minimize the immediate physical risk associated with outbreak of epidemic like SARS would be the opt alternative for them. Fortunately, relatives accepted the alternative and minimized taking the patients home or out for community activities temporarily. They even decrease the frequency of visiting the patients during the critical period. To alleviate their anxiety, they were encouraged to inquire patients' condition periodically by phone. In fact they were eager to receive the standing down messages from the hospital. By that time, they could take the patients home and out for community activities again.",

As the virus can be effectively contained by quarantine alone (Holmes \uf732\uf730\uf730\uf733) , the practice of grouping within an isolation room should be continuously implemented in the hospital. A standard isolation room should be constructed as the environmental layout of the isolation ward was found inadequate.

On the same day in Singapore, a Singaporean man had tested positive for SARS in the first new case of the disease in \uf734 months. Other than SARS, the threat of new infectious disease is never ending. There should be a proven effective infection control system in place to cope with any sudden onset of infectious disease especially in institutions for patients with ID. Putting into practice all infection control precautionary measures is the responsibility of the health care workers themselves. A good infection control system should include comprehensive operational infection control procedures, human resources deployment plan, infection control standards and audits, staff education and training and material resources. All health care workers should work according to the standards as laid down. Moreover, the system should be reviewed and updated regularly.
