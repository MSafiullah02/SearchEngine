            "text": "Compounds that can selectively alter expression levels of any gene have been sought by basic scientists and clinicians for many years. Nucleic acid hybridization is very specific, and theoretically the sequence of any desired gene could be uniquely targeted by an oligonucleotide of complementary sequence. The first \u201cantisense\u201d experiments were performed over 25 years ago and employed DNA oligonucleotides to block translation of Rous sarcoma virus RNA 1, 2. Experiments demonstrating the use of antisense RNA to inhibit gene expression soon followed 3, 4. Most antisense methods that use single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) or single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) oligonucleotides rely upon either RNase H-mediated degradation of the target mRNA or steric blockade of translation for their mechanism of action [5]. However, other pathways have been exploited with favorable results. For example, 2\u2032,5\u2032-oligoadenylate (2-5A) triggers action of RNase L; conjugation of 2-5L to an antisense oligonucleotide sequence enables sequence-specific targeting of this otherwise nonspecific ribonuclease [6].",

Pharmaceutical companies have been working to develop antisense drugs for more than 15 years and extensive knowledge of the pharmacology and toxicology of synthetic nucleic acids in vivo has been compiled [9]. As of 2005, one antisense drug is on the market. Formivirsen (Vitravene), a product of Isis Pharmaceuticals and Novartis Ophthalmics, is a 21-mer phosphorothioate DNA oligonucleotide that is complementary to the immediate early region 2 of cytomegalovirus (CMV). This compound has been shown to be effective in the treatment of CMV retinitis and was approved by the FDA for use by direct intravitreal injection in 1998 10, 11. Currently, over 20 antisense drugs are in various stages of clinical testing [12]. Although antisense methods have been successfully used for years to study gene function, antisense technology has failed to gain widespread acceptance as a gene knockdown tool, largely due to the extensive experimental testing that often needs to be done to find effective target sites within the gene of interest.",

            "text": "In 1998 Fire and Mello described a process in Caenorhabditis elegans in which long dsRNA (several hundred bases in length) caused suppression of complementary genes and called this process RNA interference (RNAi) [13]. Although the mechanism was not understood at the time, RNAi had actually been seen as early as 1990 in plants as the phenomenon of cosuppression [14]. In plants, it is suspected that the degradative pathways of RNAi evolved as an antiviral defense mechanism. In higher organisms, antiviral defense mechanisms are more complex and long dsRNAs induce interferon secretion, activating a cascade of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) as well as RNAi. Therefore, long dsRNAs should not be used as an experimental tool to trigger RNAi in mammalian cells. Fortunately, long dsRNAs do not mediate suppression directly. Instead, long dsRNAs are processed by the endoribonuclease Dicer into short 21-bp duplexes with 2-base 3\u2032 overhangs called small interfering (si) RNAs, which are the actual effector species 15, 16, 17. Synthetic siRNAs can be transfected into mammalian cells and specifically suppress expression of complementary genes [18], usually without triggering interferon responses. The siRNA enters a multimember protein complex called RISC (RNA induced silencing complex) by which one strand of the duplex (the \u201cpassenger strand\u201d) is cleaved and discarded 19, 20. The other strand is retained and serves as the \u201cguide strand,\u201d which directs the sequence specificity of RISC and therefore of RNAi silencing. Some of the components of human RISC have been identified and have assigned functions. Argonaute 2 (Ago2) functions as \u201cslicer,\u201d the RNA endonuclease that cleaves a target RNA species as directed by the siRNA guide strand 21, 22, 23. Dicer and TRBP form a heterodimer, which processes long dsRNA into siRNAs 24, 25, and together complex with the siRNA and Ago2 to form a functional silencing complex [26]. The biochemistry of degradative RNAi has been extensively studied and has been well summarized in recent reviews 27, 28, 29, 30, 31.",

First, synthetic RNA duplexes can be introduced directly into animals; the RNAi effect will be transient. In this case, the dsRNA is usually chemically synthesized and the problems surrounding its use parallel those encountered in small-molecule or antisense drug development. Alternatively, dsRNA can be expressed inside cells using DNA templates that direct synthesis of RNA duplexes or short hairpin RNAs; in this case the RNAi effect can be sustained and could theoretically be permanent, depending upon the vector employed and whether expression levels are adequately maintained long term. DNA-directed RNAi (ddRNAi) expression cassettes can be introduced into animals using plasmid or viral vectors. Problems surrounding this approach parallel those encountered with other forms of gene therapy. The present review is restricted to the use of chemically synthesized siRNA duplexes in vivo with a focus on methodology.

Before undertaking an in vivo experiment, however, actual validation of duplexes in vitro should be performed; it is usually necessary to test only a small number of duplexes, possibly as few as three or four, to find suitable candidates. It is preferable to have more than one effective siRNA available for each target to help control for off-target effects (see below).

Phosphorothioate (PS) modifications can be easily placed in the RNA duplex at any desired position and will prolong the life of the duplex when exposed to serum or other nuclease sources. Limited PS modification preserves potency of the siRNA; however, extensively modified duplexes show reduced potency and/or toxicity 54, 55, 56, 57. Extensive PS modification can also lead to artifacts due to nonspecific protein binding [58], so it may be preferable to limit the use of this modification to terminal positions (or 3\u2032 overhangs) where added nuclease resistance is probably most important.

A number of reports have described patterns of 2\u2032-O-methyl incorporation that retain full potency of the siRNA compared with unmodified RNA and are stable in serum 49, 55, 57. The precise pattern of incorporation is important and RNAs that are entirely substituted with 2\u2032-O-methyl are inactive as triggers of RNAi. Alternating the 2\u2032-O-methyl bases retains potency and confers substantial nuclease resistance [49]. The 2\u2032-fluoro (2\u2032-F) modification has also been used with good results 54, 55, 56. This modification is usually incorporated selectively at pyrimidine bases due to reagent issues. Their use either alone or in combination with 2\u2032-O-methyl purines will stabilize RNA duplexes. In fact, duplexes can be fully modified such that no unmodified RNA remains [59]. Locked nucleic acids (LNAs) are a different class of 2\u2032 modification in which a methylene bridge connects the 2\u2032-O with the 4\u2032-C of the ribose. This modification \u201clocks\u201d the ribose in the 3\u2032-endo conformation and improves both duplex stability and nuclease resistance. LNAs can be incorporated into siRNAs; however, placement to achieve best effect is more restricted than for 2\u2032-O-methyl or 2\u2032-F bases 56, 60, 61.",

Layzer and colleagues modified an anti-luciferase siRNA with 2\u2032-F pyrimidines and compared it with unmodified siRNA in vivo using hydrodynamic tail vein injection. SiRNAs were co-injected with a luciferase expression plasmid and luciferase activity in the liver was assessed by in vivo bioluminescence imaging 2\u20137 days after injection [62]. Despite improved nuclease stability, no functional difference in luciferase knockdown was observed between modified and unmodified siRNAs. Using hydrodynamic delivery, injected nucleic acids are rapidly taken up by hepatocytes, thus nuclease resistance may not be as important for siRNA administered using this approach than when using more traditional low-pressure intravenous administration. Unfortunately, only a single 10-\u03bcg siRNA dose was used, making it difficult to assess potency accurately without the additional data obtained from dose\u2013response curves. Other groups have reported substantial benefit from the use of highly modified siRNA duplexes. Morrissey and colleagues compared activity of an unmodified siRNA with that of a highly modified duplex that included DNA bases, 2\u2032-O-methyl purines, 2\u2032-F pyrimidines, terminal inverted-dT bases, and PS linkage modification at select positions (leaving no unmodified RNA). A hepatitis B virus (HBV) expression plasmid was co-injected with modified or unmodified duplexes into the tail vein of mice using the same hydrodynamic delivery method, and production of HBV DNA and hepatitis B surface antigen was assayed 72 h postinjection [63]. A 2-log dose\u2013response curve was performed and the modified duplexes were significantly more potent. Unmodified RNA may be suitable for use in some in vivo research applications, especially if a delivery vehicle that offers protection from serum nucleases is employed. However, there may be reasons beyond nuclease resistance to include modified bases in siRNAs used in vivo (see discussion of innate immunity below).",

A dinitrophenol end modification has been shown to improve transfection and increase intracellular stability in tissue culture [66].

The innate immune system relies upon a series of receptor molecules that recognize \u201cpathogen-associated molecular patterns\u201d and that initiate a variety of cellular responses when these motifs are encountered 73, 74.

This effect appeared to be sequence independent as two different siRNAs that did not share any obvious sequence motifs triggered the same effect. In contrast, stimulation of IFN-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b2, or phospho-PKR was not detected after administration of either 21-mer or 27-mer dsRNAs in HEK293 cells [38]. Activation of 2\u2032,5\u2032-OAS by dsRNA requires a minimum RNA length of 30 bp and maximal activation is not achieved until length reaches 60\u201380 bp [81], so direct triggering of 2\u2032,5\u2032-OAS by siRNAs is unlikely to be a problem. Requirements for RIG-I activation are under investigation, but it appears that it can recognize short siRNAs and may be a major pathway for IFN production and activation of ISGs, at least in vitro (J. T. Marques and B. R. G. Williams, personal communication). RNA synthesized by in vitro transcription retains a triphosphate group at the 5\u2032 end, which can trigger a robust IFN response [82]; this is easily avoided by use of chemically synthesized RNA of known structure and purity.",

Toll-like receptors 7 and 8 recognize ssRNA [86] and can be triggered by siRNAs in a sequence-specific fashion. Single-stranded RNA is more effective than double-stranded RNA in triggering TLR7 and 8 responses [87]. The sequences UGUGU 88, 89 and GUCCUUCAA [90] have been demonstrated to stimulate secretion of a variety of cytokines from TLR7- or 8-bearing cell types. TLR7 and 8 are expressed in a limited number of cell types including myeloid dendritic cells, plasmacytoid dendritic cells, neutrophils, B cells, and monocytes. However, these cells are found throughout the body; siRNAs can trigger IFN secretion from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), so stimulation of the innate immune system must be considered when using any kind of systemic administration [89]. TLR3, 7, and 8 are localized intracellularly in endosomes and delivery to this compartment must take place for activation to occur. In cell culture, cationic lipid transfection agents deliver nucleic acids to endosomal compartments, while electroporation does not, and siRNA delivery done using electroporation is less likely to stimulate IFN secretion [87]. These same principles appear to apply in vivo. Intravenous administration to mice of unmodified siRNAs complexed in lipid particles is more likely to cause IFN pathway activation [52] than intravenous administration of unmodified \u201cnaked\u201d siRNAs using high-volume hydrodynamic delivery [91]. Cationic DOTAP liposomes significantly enhance the ability of siRNA to trigger IFN responses in PBMCs and in mice 92, 93. More information about siRNA activation of innate immunity via TLR signaling can be found in a recent review by Marques and Williams [94].",

Use of chemically modified RNAs may overcome many of these problems. A recent study by Kariko and colleagues compared the capacity of RNA from prokaryotic and eukaryotic sources for their ability to trigger IFN responses. They observed that prokaryotic RNAs were a much more potent trigger of signaling through TLR3, 7, and 8 pathways than eukaryotic RNAs. Weaker or absent receptor signaling from eukaryotic RNAs was not sequence dependent but rather was due to the base and/or sugar modifications that were present in these nucleic acids. Much like 5-methyl-dC, which can reduce or prevent activation of TLR9 in CpG motif DNA, the presence of 5-methyl-C, N\n6-methyl-A, pseudouridine, or 2\u2032-O-methyl bases prevents recognition of RNA by TLR3, 7, and 8 [95]. Importantly, it has been shown that extensive 2\u2032 modification of a sequence that is otherwise strongly immunostimulatory as unmodified RNA can prevent an immune response when that same sequence is administered intravenously (iv) in mice using a lipid-based particle delivery system [52]. However, it might not be necessary to modify an RNA duplex this extensively to block immune responses. Judge and colleagues reported that substitution of as few as two 2\u2032-O-methyl bases in one strand of a siRNA duplex can be sufficient to block TLR activation both in vitro (human PBMCs) and in vivo (iv delivery in mice using stabilized nucleic acid lipid particle (SNALP)-facilitated delivery). Modified U and G bases were most effective in achieving this affect [96]. Since selective incorporation of 2\u2032-O-methyl bases is inexpensive and does not compromise siRNA functional activity, use of this modification in all duplexes intended for in vivo applications should be considered.",

Degradative RNAi leads to sequence-specific cleavage of a target mRNA as directed by RISC using Ago2 21, 22, 103 and initiation of this event requires perfect or near-perfect base pairing with the siRNA-derived guide strand. Conversely, the microRNA (miRNA) pathway results in translational repression and is directed by imperfect base pairing between target and guide strand 104, 105. This pathway is theorized to be mediated by a variant of RISC using Ago1. Functionally, the siRNA degradative pathway and miRNA translational repression pathway overlap. Exogenously supplied siRNA duplexes can function as miRNAs 106, 107 and miRNAs can direct target cleavage events 108, 109. It seems likely that many of the OTEs attributed to siRNAs derive from miRNA-like target interactions, which can be triggered by surprisingly limited sequence homology. Target specificity for miRNAs is largely directed by a 7-nucleotide \u201cseed region\u201d at the 5\u2032 end of the antisense strand of the miRNA [110]. Unfortunately, even this small amount of homology can give rise to OTEs. Lin and colleagues reported results from a large-scale siRNA library screen in which their top three \u201chits\u201d all derived from off-target events and, further, that two of these events resulted from only a 7-bp complementation between the siRNA and the \u201coff target\u201d [111].",

For development of siRNAs as therapeutic agents, extensive testing may be needed to ensure that a potential drug candidate has an acceptable degree of OTEs.

Cationic lipids are routinely used with great success as transfection agents in tissue culture; however, their in vivo use by iv administration presents significant problems as these reagents can be quite toxic. Despite problems with iv use, cationic lipids can sometimes be employed for ip injection 113, 114, 115, for CNS injection 116, 117, or in topical epithelial surface application 118, 119. Toxicity varies with the precise chemical composition of the lipids employed, dose, and a variety of other factors. Variations in chemical composition can have a large impact on the functional properties of cationic lipid mixtures [120] and lipoplex/liposomal preparations have been devised with decreased toxicity that are more compatible with iv administration. Liposomal formulations have been FDA approved for small-molecule drug delivery since the late 1990s [121]. Liposomes can be modified with ligands such as folate or small peptides, which assist with delivery and help target specific cell types or tissues 122, 123. Through the use of neutral polyethylene glycol-substituted surfaces and other approaches, liposomes can be stabilized and made more \u201cstealthy,\u201d showing reduced clearance and improved pharmacokinetics 124, 125. These kinds of lipid nanoparticles have been successfully used to deliver antisense oligonucleotides and siRNAs in vivo\n52, 126, 127, 128.",

CDPs have been synthesized using other polycations (than PEI) and optionally can include terminal imidazole groups to improve endosomal trafficking[183]. Conjugation of transferrin to a linear cyclodextrin containing polymer/adamantine/PEG complex improves tumor targeting in vivo and this kind of polyplex has been shown to effectively deliver siRNAs in mice [134]. As a general strategy, transferrin-conjugated polycations were shown to facilitate transfection of DNA 15 years ago [135]. A variety of different conjugates that facilitate delivery of nucleic acids have been characterized [8] and novel small-molecule libraries are under development that assist targeting of different cell types and may eventually offer a \u201cmenu\u201d that enables selective delivery of therapeutic compounds wherever desired [136].",

In fact, the single most commonly employed strategy for in vivo siRNA delivery to date has been the \u201chydrodynamic delivery\u201d (HD) method 62, 63, 91, 112, 148, 149, 150, 151, 152, 153, 154, 155, 156, 157, 158, 159, 160, 161, 162, 163, 164, 165. In this approach, a large volume of a nucleic acid solution is rapidly injected into the tail vein of a mouse, which transiently disrupts vascular and tissue integrity and achieves delivery [166]. Morbidity can be significant and success using this method is technique dependent. Nevertheless, HD is useful as a research tool and is especially effective in delivering nucleic acids to the liver. Recent reports have also demonstrated success using electroporation 167, 168, 169, 170, 171, 172, ultrasound [173], and particle-based \u201cgene gun\u201d [174] delivery systems.",

Liposomes were administered by tail vein injection and mice were followed for 2 weeks. Two of three mice given a single dose of 100 mg/kg DOTAP liposomes died compared with 0/3 mice given CCLA liposomes. The CCLA liposomes were also studied with a multiple dose regimen and 1/3 mice that received 100 mg/kg/day for 3 consecutive days died.

            "text": "Much of the toxicity of cationic lipids relates to electrostatic effects, and precise complexation ratios of the positively charged lipid with the negatively charged cargo nucleic acid are important. Interaction with negatively charged serum proteins can inactivate the complex [175] and particle aggregation with clumping in capillary beds can be problematic; interaction with complement proteins can lead to inflammation. When loaded with a nucleic acid cargo, cationic lipids can trigger the release of a variety of cytokines (see discussion of TLR activation above). Lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and hepatic necrosis can occur with higher doses of lipid [176]. Newer classes of lipid/nucleic acids delivery systems fully encapsulate (not just complex with) the nucleic acid cargo and present a stabilized, more neutral surface to the intravascular environment that lowers toxicity, improves stability, and prolongs serum circulation time [177]. Recent reviews by Dass [178], Audouy [179], and Simberg [180] provide greater detail on cationic liposome delivery methods and in vivo toxicity.",

Cyclodextrin polymers are much less toxic, having an LD50 of \u223c200 mg/kg in mice [182]. Grafting of \u03b2-cyclodextrin onto PEI reduces toxicity but also can decrease efficiency of nucleic acid transfection, so careful optimization is needed. The addition of adamantine\u2013PEG forms inclusion complexes that coat the complex in a way that further stabilizes the polymer/nucleic acid particle under physiological salt conditions without increasing size and helps further lower toxicity [133]. Transferrin or other ligands can be added to the polymer to help with cell-type targeting.

McCaffrey and colleagues used HD delivery to introduce 2 \u03bcg of a luciferase expression plasmid with 40 \u03bcg of unmodified control or anti-luciferase siRNAs into mice [148]. A human \u03b1-1 anti-trypsin (hAAT) expression plasmid was co-injected and serum levels of hAAT were used for normalization between animals. Luciferase activity in the liver was assessed by in vivo bioluminescence imaging 3 days after injection and the anti-luciferase siRNA was found to specifically reduce light emission by 81%. IFN levels (or other cytokines) were not measured; however, use of the hAAT marker served as a control for nonspecific effects. Similar results using HD delivery to suppress luciferase in mice were reported by Lewis and colleagues [149]. In this case RNAi activity was demonstrated to occur in multiple tissue types, including liver, kidney, spleen, lung, and pancreas. Duration of silencing was investigated using an expression plasmid encoding secreted human placental alkaline phosphatase (SEAP). Ten micrograms of the pSEAP plasmid and 5 \u03bcg of an anti-SEAP siRNA were administered by HD injection. SEAP levels were suppressed by 83% on day 1 postinjection and by 32% on day 4 and were at control levels on day 14 (possibly sooner, but intermediate time points were not reported).",

Anti-Fas siRNAs or control anti-EGFP siRNAs (50 \u03bcg in 1 ml PBS) were administered using HD delivery for three doses. Both Fas mRNA and Fas protein levels were shown to be specifically reduced about 10-fold (Fas/glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) ratio) in recipient mouse hepatocytes relative to controls. Suppression lasted \u223c10 days. Mice treated with the anti-Fas siRNA did not develop fulminant hepatitis or hepatic fibrosis after treatment with concanavalin A (which induces hepatitis). Treatment with the anti-Fas siRNA was also protective against treatment with an agonist, an anti-Fas antibody (Jo2), which is normally fatal within 2\u20133 days of injection. Similar beneficial effects were reported using the same anti-Fas siRNA in protecting mice from renal ischemia\u2013reperfusion injury [156]. SiRNAs were administered by HD delivery via the tail vein (50 \u03bcg in 1 ml PBS) or by low-pressure injection directly into the renal vein. In one series of experiments, renal ischemia was induced by clamping one renal pedicle for 35 min, and the other kidney was removed. Survival was significantly higher (8/10) for mice treated with anti-Fas siRNA than with control siRNA or saline (2/10).",

Zender and colleagues reported use of siRNAs targeting caspase 8 to block hepatic necrosis following challenge with the agonist anti-Fas antibody (Jo2) or recombinant adenovirus encoding Fas ligand [152]. SiRNAs were administered using HD tail vein injection at a dose of 0.6 nmol/g (8 mg/kg, or 200 \u03bcg per dose per 25-g mouse) or a 0.45 nmol infusion directly into the portal vein. The caspase 8 mRNA levels were reduced about fourfold (caspase 8/GAPDH ratio) following siRNA treatment in mouse hepatocytes. Following administration of the Jo2 Fas-agonist antibody, 5/11 mice treated with the anti-caspase 8 siRNA survived, while 0/17 control animals survived. Using a strategy similar to that discussed previously for protection of Fas-induced renal ischemia\u2013reperfusion injury, Contreras and colleagues reported success in using anti-caspase 8 and anti-caspase 3 siRNAs in protecting mice from hepatic ischemia\u2013reperfusion injury [154]. A variant of HD delivery was employed in which low dose 0.45 nmol (6 \u03bcg) siRNA was administered in 1 ml volume directly into the portal vein. SiRNAs were administered 1 h before injury, hepatic blood supply was clamped for 90 min, and hepatic caspase 3 and 8 levels were assayed 1 h after reperfusion. Both caspase enzymes are strongly induced by ischemia; however, the relative level of induction was reduced approximately twofold by siRNA treatment. In one arm of the study, mice were observed for 30 days after a 75-min ischemic injury to the liver, with or without siRNA pretreatment. Mice treated with anti-caspase 3 showed 50% survival (5/10), mice treated with anti-caspase 8 showed 30% survival (3/10), while control mice showed 10% survival (1/10, control siRNA) or no survival (0/10, vehicle).",

Giladi and colleagues demonstrated that a plasmid encoding the hepatitis B virus (HBV) genome can be codelivered with siRNAs to the liver of mice using the HD method to study the effects of anti-HBV siRNAs on viral replication [151]. Five HBV siRNAs were tested, which, not surprisingly, showed different functional potency. The most potent reagent was capable of reducing HBV titers produced in transfected livers by 105 on day 2 and 102 on day 3 at the dose studied (15 \u03bcg HBV plasmid with 1 nmol, or 13 \u03bcg siRNA). Morrissey and colleagues employed a similar HBV plasmid model system to study the use of anti-HBV siRNAs in mice, also using HD delivery [63], and compared performance of modified vs unmodified RNAs. The modified duplexes (called \u201csmall interfering nucleic acids, or siNAs) performed better, showing a 1.5-log greater reduction in HBV DNA and surface antigen levels 72 h postinjection than when the same sequence was administered as an unmodified siRNA. Importantly, only the modified duplexes suppressed HBV when treatment was started 3 days after \u201cinfection\u201d (via delivery of the HBV plasmid by HD injection); however, a significantly higher dose was needed in this setting (30 mg/kg).",

A high level of RR is believed to be one cause of resistance to gemcitabine chemotherapy. RR levels can be reduced using siRNAs targeting the M2 subunit of RR (RRM2) and this treatment increases tumor cell susceptibility to gemcitabine in vitro. MIAPaCa2 pancreatic tumor cells were implanted in nude mice and were given control treatments, an anti-RRM2 siRNA (150 \u03bcg/kg iv), and/or gemcitabine (150 mg ip) twice weekly for 6 weeks. Mice treated with the anti-RRM2 siRNA showed reduced RRM2 levels in tumor extracts by Western blot compared with control siRNA-treated mice. Treatment with gemcitabine or the anti-RRM2 siRNA alone resulted in a modest reduction in tumor volume, while treatment with the combination of gemcitabine with anti-RRM2 siRNA showed a synergistic effect with 87% reduction in tumor size. Mice receiving combination treatment had no detectable liver metastasis, whereas 80% of control and 40% of gemcitabine or siRNA monotherapy animals had significant tumor burden in their livers. This group continued to investigate using siRNAs as a therapy for pancreatic adenocarcinoma using a different target, CEACAM6, a cell-surface adhesion molecule thought to play a role in tumor progression and metastasis. As before, unmodified siRNAs were administered at a dose of 150 \u03bcg/kg in PBS iv via the tail vein twice weekly. BxPC3 cells were implanted in the pancreas of nude mice and animals were given PBS alone, a control siRNA, or an anti-CEACAM6 siRNA for 6 weeks. Mice treated with target-specific siRNAs had smaller tumors, 46% lower CEACAM6 levels, reduced evidence of angiogenesis (CD34+ structures using immunohistochemical staining), and reduced hepatic metastasis compared to control mice. Survival after 6 weeks of treatment was 0/10 for PBS-treated mice, 0/10 for control siRNA-treated mice, and 9/10 for anti-CEACAM6-treated mice [189].",

Duplexes were chemically modified by selective incorporation of 2\u2032-O-methyl RNA bases and phosphorothioate linkages. Cholesterol modification increased serum half-life 15-fold compared with unconjugated siRNAs. Following iv injection, siRNA levels present in various tissues were measured using a sensitive RNase protection assay (RPA) and only the modified, conjugated RNA duplexes were detectable; these siRNAs were seen in liver, heart, kidney, adipose, and lung tissue. Extensive sequence optimization was performed; 84 siRNAs were screened in vitro and the 2 best candidates were used in vivo. Mice received the anti-apoB siRNAs or a control siRNA at a dose of 50 mg/kg iv daily for 3 days and cholesterol levels were measured 24 h after the last dose. ApoB-100 protein levels were reduced by 68% (siRNA apoB-1) and by 31% (siRNA apoB-2); the more potent siRNA showed a 37% reduction in total serum cholesterol. Although IFN or other cytokines were not measured directly to assess activation of the innate immune system, mRNA levels for three unrelated control genes were found to be unaffected by siRNA treatment. Mechanism of action was demonstrated in vivo using a 5\u2032-RACE procedure.

Delivery efficiency was estimated to be approximately sevenfold better than with traditional DOTAP liposomes and had lower toxicity. The Ras/Raf/MAPK signaling pathway is thought to be important in around 30% of human cancers. An unmodified siRNA specific for c-raf was administered via the tail vein at a dose of 7.5 mg/kg twice a day for 5 days to SCID mice bearing sc implants of the breast cancer tumor MDA-MB-231. Tumors in mice treated with naked siRNAs grew at the same rate as controls, while tumors in mice treated with liposomal\u2013siRNAs were 73% smaller at day 8, suggesting that the delivery vehicle had a significant impact on the therapeutic efficacy of the anti-c-Raf siRNA treatment. A similar series of experiments studied the effect of an anti-Raf-1 siRNA with or without the chemotherapy agent Taxotere in suppressing the growth of sc implants of the prostate cancer cell line PC-3 in SCID mice [127]. Mice were administered unmodified siRNAs at a dose of 7.5 mg/kg twice a day for 5 days, either naked or complexed in CCLA liposomes, with or without the coadministration of Taxotere (10 mg/kg on day 2 and 5 mg/kg on day 5). Tumors were excised and Western blots were performed to examine Raf-1 protein levels.

Dye-labeled RNA duplexes were injected into mice iv and the use of naked, DOTAP liposome, and DOPC liposome delivery was compared using fluorescence microscopy. The DOPC liposomes gave an estimated 10-fold improved delivery compared with DOTAP liposomes and 30-fold improved delivery compared with naked RNA; the greatest uptake of siRNA was seen in liver, kidney, and lung. EphA2 is a tyrosine kinase receptor that is overexpressed in some human cancers and is associated with poor outcome in ovarian cancer. Nude mice with ip implants of the ovarian cancer cell line HeyA8 or SKOV3ip1 were given control or anti-EphA2 siRNA (150 \u03bcg/kg iv twice weekly in DOPC liposomes) for 4 weeks, with or without the chemotherapeutic agent Paclitaxel (100 \u03bcg ip weekly).

Several studies have reported similar observations in which the combination of siRNA with a cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agent worked additively or synergistically in reducing tumor size. It is also worth noting the very low dose of siRNA employed in this study, presumably due to improved delivery using the neutral liposome carrier.",

The particle, called a SNALP, contained cationic, neutral, and fusogenic lipids that fully encapsulate the nucleic acid cargo; an earlier version of this particle was reported to improve delivery of phosphorothioate antisense oligonucleotides in mice [193]. Both unmodified and highly modified siRNAs (including 2\u2032-O-methyl, 2\u2032-F, DNA, and PS bonds) were tested by Morrissey. Unmodified siRNAs administered using this delivery method strongly stimulated innate immune responses while the highly modified duplexes did not. Delivery of a fluorescent siRNA was examined and use of SNALPs resulted in highest levels of RNA in liver and spleen but showed little accumulation in lung. Plasma half-life of modified siNAs in SNALPs was 6.5 h compared with 2 min for unmodified naked siRNAs. Hepatitis \u201cinfection\u201d was initiated with HD delivery of 0.3 \u03bcg of pWTD HBV plasmid and siRNA therapy was started 6 days later. Mice received control or anti-HBV siRNAs in SNALPs at doses of 0.3 or 3 mg/kg/day for 3 days. Serum HBV DNA levels dropped by 1.5 log10 for the higher dose, and reduction in HBV DNA levels persisted for 6 weeks after the last siNA dose. Effective reduction in HBV DNA was achieved using 3 mg/kg dosing with SNALPs compared with 30 mg/kg for the same sequences administered using HD delivery [63].",

Schiffelers and colleagues described the use of a \u201csterically stabilized nanoparticle\u201d to deliver unmodified siRNAs to neuroblastoma N2A tumors in nude mice [130]. The particles contained PEI (\u201cP\u201d nanoparticles), PEI + PEG (\u201cPP\u201d nanoparticles) or PEI + PEG plus an Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) peptide that promotes vascular targeting (\u201cRPP\u201d nanoparticles). Complex formation of siRNAs in the particles (nanoplexes) protected unmodified siRNAs from degradation in serum and altered in vivo delivery patterns. A fluorescence-labeled naked siRNA did not accumulate in tumors, lung, or liver and was mostly degraded and/or excreted in urine. The fluorescence-labeled P nanoplex accumulated more in lung than in liver or tumor, while the labeled RPP nanoplex improved uptake more selectively in the N2A tumor masses (distribution of PP nanoplexes was not reported). SiRNA duplexes specific for the murine vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR2) were administered to mice bearing N2A tumors at a dose of 40 \u03bcg iv every 3 days. After three cycles of treatment, mice receiving the anti-VEGFR2 siRNA as an RPP nanoplex showed >90% inhibition of tumor growth compared with vehicle-only or control siRNA-treated mice. Newer formulations of this particle that may have even greater potential in siRNA drug development have been devised [194].",

This cyclodextrin polycation (\u201cpolyplex\u201d) was conjugated to transferrin to improve uptake into tumor cells and used to deliver unmodified siRNAs in a mouse model of Ewing sarcoma [134]. Many Ewing sarcoma tumors contain a translocation, t(11;22), that results in production of an aberrant transcript, EWS-FL11, which is thought to function as an oncogenic transcription factor. An anti-EWS-F11 siRNA (siEFB2) and a control siRNA were administered to SCID mice bearing tumors formed from TC71 cells that stably express luciferase (enabling bioluminescence imaging of tumor implants). Administration of siEFB2 for 3 days using the transferrin polyplex at a dose of 50 \u03bcg (2.5 mg/kg/day) resulted in transient suppression of the luciferase signal and 60% reduction in EWS-F11 mRNA levels (normalized to \u03b2-actin) in established tumors. In another series of experiments, siRNA administration was started concurrent with injection of the TC71-Luc tumor cells. Mice were followed for up to 8 weeks with twice weekly dosing (2.5 mg/kg) of siRNAs. Mice receiving control siRNAs (in any form) and those receiving naked siEFB2 had rapid tumor development. Mice receiving siEFB2 with nontargeting polyplexes had delayed onset of tumors and those receiving siEGB2 delivered with transferrin polyplexes had minimal to no tumor formation. Ogris and colleagues described the use of transferrin and epidermal growth factor as ligands to improve targeting of DNA polyplexes (PEGylated PEI) to tumor cells in mice [195]. Employing some kind of specific cell-surface marker or receptor targeting technique seems generally to improve in vivo delivery of nucleic acid polyplexes.",

Song and colleagues described a method in which protamine was conjugated to the C-terminus of an antibody Fab fragment and used as a cell-marker-specific reagent to deliver unmodified siRNAs in mice [138]. In one series of experiments, a Fab fragment (F105) specific for the HIV envelope glycoprotein gp160 was coupled to protamine (F105-P). Six siRNAs formed a delivery complex with one F105-P carrier. This complex was effective in delivering siRNAs to all cell types tested that expressed the HIV env gene, even T cells (which are notoriously difficult to transfect). Administration of siRNAs using the F105-P carrier did not elicit an immune response in B16 melanoma cells in vitro (\u03b2-IFN, STAT1, and OAS1 mRNA levels were assayed using qRT-PCR). While B16 cells are competent for some TLR responses and express TLR3 [196], it may be worthwhile to determine if this method of delivery triggered any innate immune response in myeloid or dendritic cell lines or in vivo. Murine B16 cells were implanted in C57BL/6 mice and different siRNAs were administered iv with or without the F105-P carrier. A fluorescent dye-labeled control siRNA was used to assess specificity of delivery. Naked siRNA did not enter tumor cells. Using the F105-P carrier, gp160-B16 tumors showed high uptake of the dye-labeled siRNA, whereas native B16 tumors did not, demonstrating the specificity of this delivery method. Tumor gp160-B16 cells were injected into the flanks of recipient mice and a cocktail of three siRNAs specific for c-myc, MDM2, and VEGF was administered either iv or by direct tumor injection with or without the F105-P carrier on days 0, 1, and 3 at a dose of 80 \u03bcg (\u223c4 mg/kg); tumors were removed at day 9. Both intratumor and iv administration of the siRNA cocktail with F105-P delivery significantly reduced tumor size, whereas naked siRNAs or control treatments had no effect.",

This treatment did not trigger an obvious innate immune response and IFN-\u03b1 was not detected in the lungs of mice using either influenza or control siRNAs with PEI. Administration of either of the influenza-specific siRNAs reduced viral titers in infected mouse lungs and a combination of anti-NP + anti-PA siRNAs was most effective. A reduction of viral titers ranging from 1 to 3 log10 was seen and siRNA treatment was effective even when given 5\u201324 h after infection. Thomas and colleagues reported that deacylated PEI (PEI187) improved delivery of plasmid DNA in mice by iv administration 104-fold and dramatically improved pulmonary targeting [131]. The deacylated PEI187 was used to deliver anti-NP siRNAs in mice by retroorbital iv injection using the same in vivo influenza model system described by Ge. A 94% reduction in viral titers was achieved with administration of a single 120-\u03bcg dose of siRNA.

As mentioned previously, the only FDA-approved antisense drug (Vitravene) is given by intraocular injection to treat CMV retinitis. Intraocular injection is therefore an obvious approach for in vivo use of siRNAs for both research applications and pharmaceutical development. Reich and colleagues described the use of unmodified siRNAs administered by intraocular injection to inhibit neovascularization following laser photocoagulation [200]. To demonstrate the feasibility of the method, recombinant adenovirus expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) were injected subretinally in the eyes of mice with or without 20 pmol (\u223c0.27 \u03bcg) of an anti-EGFP siRNA, and retina were examined at 48 h. The anti-EGFP siRNA almost totally eliminated EGFP fluorescence, even using this very low dose. Administration of a similar low dose of an anti-VEGF siRNA reduced the area of choroidal neovascularization after laser photocoagulation injury by \u223c75%.",

A dose of 7.5 \u03bcg given by periocular injection (a less traumatic method of administration) on days 1, 4, 7, 10, and 13 resulted in a 45% reduction in neovascularization following laser treatment. Treatment with Sirna-027 was also protective against oxygen-induced ischemic retinopathy. Both VEGFR1 mRNA and protein were demonstrated to be specifically reduced by injection of Sirna-027.

Tompkins and colleagues used unmodified siRNAs specific to viral NP and PA proteins to protect mice from lethal infection with influenza virus [157]. SiRNAs in PBS were administered iv by HD tail vein injection 16\u201324 h prior to infection (single dose of 50 \u03bcg, or \u223c2.5 mg/kg). Influenza virus was then coadministered with siRNAs complexed with the cationic lipid Oligofectamine by direct intranasal infusion in mice at a dose of 1.5 nmol (20 \u03bcg, or \u223c1 mg/kg). Viral titers in lung tissue were reduced as much as 63-fold using anti-influenza siRNAs compared with the control siRNA and survival was significantly improved, especially in mice receiving a combination of anti-NP + anti-PA siRNAs. Bitko and colleagues described the use of unmodified siRNAs to treat pulmonary infection with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and parainfluenza virus in mice by targeting the viral P gene for both viruses [216]. SiRNAs in PBS were administered either naked or complexed with the cationic lipid TransIT-TKO by direct intranasal infusion in mice at a dose of 35 \u03bcg in each nostril (70 \u03bcg total dose, or \u223c3.5 mg/kg). Treatment with naked siRNAs was \u223c70% as effective as with cationic lipid. Mice receiving antiviral siRNAs showed decreased lung pathology and overall distress compared with mice receiving control siRNAs. Although the greatest improvement was seen when treatment was started at the time of infection, some benefit was seen when siRNA treatment was given 1, 2, and even 3 days postinfection.",

Li and colleagues describe the use of unmodified siRNAs delivered intranasally in D5W in rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) [217]. Delivery of siRNAs targeting a reporter construct were first tested using D5W or InfaSurf via intranasal delivery in mice and the D5W carrier gave superior results and was therefore employed in the primate studies. A mixture of two siRNAs specific for the Spike protein-coding and ORF1b regions was administered 4 h prior to infection (single dose), at the time of infection (and at 1, 3, and 5 days postinfection), or 4 h postinfection (and at 1 and 3 days postinfection). Each dose was 30 mg in 3 ml D5W and total cumulative dosing was 30 to 120 mg siRNA (10\u201340 mg/kg). The severity of symptoms was improved in all treatment groups. Animals were tested at 4 days postinfection for the presence of SCV RNA using a qRT-PCR assay (from oropharyngeal swab samples); all control animals were positive for SCV viral RNA, while 75% of anti-SCV siRNA-treated animals had no detectable viral RNA.",

Interestingly, it is also being employed to assist with siRNA delivery in vivo. Golzio and colleagues described electroporation-assisted delivery of an EGFP expression plasmid with or without an unmodified anti-EGFP siRNA following direct injection into mouse muscles in PBS [171]. EGFP fluorescence was specifically reduced by the anti-EGFP but not the control siRNA; targeting of an endogenous target was not described. Schiffelers and colleagues used electroporation to assist with delivery of unmodified siRNAs targeting TNF-\u03b1 in mice with collagen-induced arthritis [170]. Injection of an EGFP expression plasmid into the knee joint of mice showed local expression of EGFP only if electroporation was employed. Coadministration (injection + electroporation) of 2 \u03bcg of a luciferase expression plasmid with 10 \u03bcg of either the anti-EGFP (control) or the anti-Luc siRNAs showed 90% suppression of luciferase activity when the anti-Luc siRNA was used. Collagen-induced arthritis was induced by injection of mice with type II collagen and inflammation was triggered with ip injection of LPS 3 days after the second dose of collagen. Anti-TNF-\u03b1 siRNA treatment was initiated 3 days after LPS treatment at a dose of 10 \u03bcg (direct injection with electroporation into the knee joint) and was administered weekly for three doses. Animals treated with the anti-TNF-\u03b1 siRNA showed a marked improvement in inflammation and reduced arthritis score relative to control animals. Similarly, Inoue and colleagues used electroporation to assist with delivery of an unmodified siRNA targeting TNF-\u03b1 in rats with collagen-induced arthritis [172]. In this case, 0.8 nmol (\u223c11 \u03bcg) of the anti-TNF-\u03b1 siRNA or a control siRNA was injected into the knee joint in rats in cationic lipid (siPORT Amine) followed by electroporation. TNF-\u03b1 mRNA levels were reduced in synovial tissue and inflammation was markedly reduced as assessed by both paw swelling and histological examination in anti-TNF-\u03b1-treated animals relative to controls.",

Infection with human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV-16) is associated with development of cervical carcinoma. Attempts to immunize mice against HPV-16 through the use of a DNA vaccine (a plasmid expressing the E7 gene of HPV-16) resulted in an incomplete response, partially due to the transient nature of antigen presentation by resident antigen-presenting cells (APCs). The authors tested if coadministration of the HPV-16 E7 plasmid with siRNAs targeting the proapoptotic genes BAX and BAK would prolong survival of the APCs and improve vaccination. Nucleic acids were coated onto gold microcarriers and delivered subdermally using the Helios gene gun at a dose of 2 \u03bcg plasmid coadministered with 0.2 \u03bcg unmodified anti-BAK + anti-BAX siRNAs. Vaccine delivered with the BAK + BAX siRNAs increased the number of antigen-specific IFN-\u03b3+ CD8+ T cell precursors. Further, mice receiving the combined vaccine (E7 with BAX + BAK siRNAs) showed a marked reduction in tumor burden when injected with TC-1 cells expressing the E7 antigen compared with mice that received the E7 vaccine with the control siRNA.",

Few published studies actually measured cytokine levels. Most simply employed \u201ccontrol\u201d siRNAs to ensure that immune stimulation or other unintended events did not occur. Given the sequence-specific nature of innate immune responses, confidence in these kinds of controls may be misplaced, even if modified siRNAs that have a lower incidence of immune stimulation are employed. Measurement of serum IFN-\u03b1, TNF-\u03b1, and possibly IL-12 levels at \u223c4\u20136 h posttreatment should be considered, especially when systemic administration methods are employed. If local administration is employed, assays should include extracts prepared from the injected site/organ as well as from serum.",

Microarrays have been used to assess the extent of OTEs at the gene expression level on a genome-wide scale in studies done in cell culture; however, this kind of experiment has not been reported yet in vivo and these kinds of data might be difficult to interpret. One approach to control for OTEs would be to require the use of two (or more) different siRNAs against the same target with the expectation that both result in suppression of the targeted gene and produce the same biological response (phenotype). Few of the in vivo studies reported to date confirmed results using two independent siRNA sequences. Further, few of the studies discussed here performed any kind of dose\u2013response optimization of the siRNA reagent in vivo and instead simply reported results using a single dosing regimen. Even though these studies are expensive to perform in mammals, it is important to characterize the system fully and this kind of information may uncover dose-dependent side effects. Actual OTE-related events will probably show variation between individuals, especially in out-bred populations, making these controls even more important to include in this setting.",

Route of administration and choice of which delivery tool to use will be crucial to success. Other than hydrodynamic delivery, too few in vivo studies have been published using any other single method to accumulate the amount of information needed to assess functional performance adequately (with different target genes and different target tissues) or permit a general endorsement of that method, although several approaches do seem quite promising. Unfortunately, many of the most advanced delivery systems employed in the studies discussed above are not available to most researchers. Widespread adoption of RNAi using synthetic siRNAs as an in vivo research tool will accelerate as more effective mammalian delivery tools become commercially available. If the target tissue or system of study permits the use of a local delivery approach, this method may be easier to perform using \u201coff the shelf\u201d tools and offer greater assurance of success than systemic iv administration.",
