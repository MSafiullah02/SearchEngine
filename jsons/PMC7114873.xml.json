Rooms at rest (N\n = 3) were also sampled for background contamination. The rooms have two-directional forced ventilation with class F7 filters (installed in 2001). The air flow is adjusted to 84 L/s in four of the rooms (high-speed instruments, control, rest) and to 440 L/s in the two larger rooms (high-speed instruments, control). This results in one air exchange every 10 min in the slightly smaller rooms and one air exchange every 5 min in the larger rooms. The ventilation was not altered during the sampling period. The ventilation system is checked and serviced annually. The rooms do not have air-conditioning units as they are not necessary in the Finnish climate.",

The plates were opened when treatment started, one of each pair of plates was closed after 1.5 h, and the other plates were closed after 3 h. Sampling was repeated once. In addition, surface samples were collected with sterile cotton swabs from the facial masks of the dentists and dental nurses, and from different surfaces of the dental chair and cabinets, keyboards and door knobs. Samples were immediately plated on to the chocolate agar plates. Sampling was undertaken before and after disinfecting the working area in preparation for the next patient. The plates were incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 48 h. Colonies were counted and bacteria were classified by Gram stain using a light microscope with 1000 \u00d7 magnification. All patients treated during sampling were otherwise healthy and scheduled for routine dental treatments. The results are given as means of colony-forming units (CFU)/m2/h with standard deviations.

Dental surgeries are often compared with doctors' surgeries or hospital wards although procedures are not normally performed there. Most dental procedures cause some mucosal damage and significant wounds are created in periodontal treatment and dento-alveolar surgery. Thus, a dental surgery is more of an operating theatre than an office or a ward. On the other hand, the hygiene requirements for operating theatres seem exaggerated for normal dental surgeries but may be applicable to hospital environments where dental treatment is given to generally ill, hospitalized patients.",

It has been claimed that settle plates have no role in monitoring operating theatre counts, and that air samplers collecting, for example, 1 m3 of air over a 15-min sampling period would be more appropriate.17 This thinking may not, however, apply for dental surgeries because of the evident fluctuation of contamination and problems with defining the most relevant sampling moment and interpretation of the results. Passive air sampling, as used in the present study, gives a better description of the end result of a treatment session. It reflects the extent of contamination on the critical surfaces, and highlights areas that should be disinfected between patients and where items are at risk for becoming contaminated.",

Contamination was less intense during periodontal and orthodontic treatment (598 CFU/m2/h at >1.5 m from the patient) where high-speed rotating and ultrasonic instruments were not used, and was practically non-existent in rooms at rest. The present findings of the density of bacteria detected on various surfaces in the vicinity of the treatment unit are in line with previous studies.4, 18 However, the present finding that bacterial counts were generally higher in the more remote sampling points has not been reported previously. This phenomenon may be due to the increased rotating speeds of the instruments giving a higher angular velocity and longer trajectory of the bacteria.",
