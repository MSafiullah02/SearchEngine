Insulin both lowers the ADAM17 activation and increases Na + /H + exchanger (NHE) activation (1,3). Decreased ADAM17 activation reduces ACE2 cleavage and ACE2 levels (1). NHE activation increases intracellular pH. Both the reduced ACE2 and the increased intracellular pH decrease the possibility of the virus adhering ACE2 and infecting the cell. Insulin therapy seems to be the most appropriate treatment for diabetes patients with COVID-19. However, most of the time, blood sugar regulation cannot be achieved with a single agent.",

Both the decreased lactate level and inhibition of NHE may protect intracellular pH. Dapagliflozin may increase ACE2 (1). When dapagliflozin is combined with insulin treatment, insulin decreases ACE2 level by reducing ADAM17 activation and reduces viral load. Diabetic ketoacidosis may develop due to the increased need for insulin during infection. Insulin can prevent dapagliflozin from causing diabetic ketoacidosis by supplying the increased need for insulin in infection. Dapagliflozin regulates the activation of MCT and NHE by lowering the lactate level and can prevent cell ion balance degradation. Insulin plus dapagliflozin combination seems to be the best treatment option in patients with COVID-19 infection.",
