But the infection condition of genital system is still unknown. This study aimed to evaluate whether or not SARS-CoV-2 is found in the vaginal fluid of women with COVID-19 illness. Methods: 10 women with confirmed severe COVID-19 pneumonia admitted to in Tongji Zhongfa Hospital Intensive care union(ICU) ward from Feb 4, 2020 to Feb 24, 2020 were included. Clinical records, laboratory results, and computer tomography(CT)-scan examination were retrospectively reviewed. The evidence of genital infection potential was accessed by testing for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in vaginal fluids obtained from vaginal swab samples. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction(RT-PCR) was used to confirm the SARS-CoV-2 infection in vaginal fluids.",

Data sources and collection All medical records and compiled data for hospitalized patients was obtained from Feb 4, 2020 to Feb 24, 2020 in Tongji Zhongfa Hospital ICU ward which is being managed by Peking Union Medical College Hospital. All ten patients were postmenopausal women and were diagnosed with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Clinical laboratory examinations including blood analyses, serum biochemical tests, coagulation function tests Chest CT examinations were performed. Vaginal swabs were obtained between 17 to 40 days after the onset of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Vaginal swabs were inserted 2-3 cm into the vagina and rotated for 3-5 s. Swabs were transferred to the laboratory immediately and RT-PCR procedures were completed within 2 hours. We obtained, collected clinical findings, laboratory and radiological findings, therapeutic interventions and outcomes for all the patients. All data were checked by three researchers. Laboratory confirmation COVID-19 was diagnosed on the basis of WHO interim guidance World Health Organization 9 .A confirmed case of COVID-19 was defined as a positive result on RT-PCR assay of nasal and/or pharyngeal swab specimens 2 . RT-PCR assays were performed in accordance with the protocol established by the WHO 10 .",

There are few studies about the presence of viruses in body fluids 3, 12 , and no reports about the presence of virus in vaginal fluids has been reported. In our study, 10 postmenopausal women in the ICU with severe COVID-19 were tested for SARS-CoV-2 in vaginal fluid with RT-PCR assay and all samples were negative for the virus. These protective barriers against pathogens in postmenopausal women become weaker, leading to increased susceptibility to bacteria and viruses in postmenopausal women 13 Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) caused by SARS-CoV was first discovered in November 2003 in Guangdong, China. The lungs are the organs that sustain the most severe damage. As the disease progresses, patients show multiple organ invasion. Autopsy results of patients who died of SARS showed that SARS-CoV was found in the lungs, trachea / bronchus, stomach, small intestine, and distal renal tubules 8 . Autopsy results showed virus impact on the reproductive system of both men and women. Xu et al 4 observed that orchitis was present in some men with SARS. The pathology of male SARS patients showed widespread germ cell destruction, almost no spermatozoon in seminiferous tubules, and leukocyte infiltration. But the presence of the virus was not clearly detected in the testis 5, 16 . However, there is no clear study showing that SARS-CoV invades the female reproductive tract, and there is no report on detection of SARS-CoV in vaginal fluids. The autopsy pathological results of SARS patients have not found the virus in the ovaries and uterus, and one report did not assay vaginal fluids 5 .",

As the disease progresses, limited research results indicate the presence of the virus in the stools of patients with COVID-19 3 , which also suggests another possible route of transmission for the virus. At present, there is no report on the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the female reproductive tract. The issue is particularly important ,because is could help inform the risks of sexual transmission and mother-to-child transmission. In our study, we included 10 female patients of COVID-19. Unlike Ebola virus or Zika virus, SARS-CoV-2 was negative in the vaginal fluids of women with severe pneumonia.",

This finding suggests that the likelihood of transmitting SARS-Cov-2 to sexual partners through virus in vaginal fluids may be low.",

In the same study, neonatal throat swabs were also negative. Taken together, these findings suggest that the risk of vertical transmission from pregnant women to newborn delivered by cesarean section is low. Our research did not find SARS-CoV-2 by PCR in vaginal fluids as late as 40 days after disease onset in women who were still requiring ICU care for ongoing COVID-19 illness, therefore it is speculated that the risk of vertical transmission during vaginal delivery might also be very low.",

In theory, even if there is only one copy of the virus in the template, it is likely to be detected. However, in practice, if the amount of virus is small, the amplification result may not be ideal. In this research, we only recruited postmenopausal women, and the vaginal swab were taken on the 17 days or more after the onset of the disease More research about possible differences in the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 in the female genital tract of premenopausal women is needed.
