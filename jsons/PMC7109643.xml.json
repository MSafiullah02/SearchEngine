The Asia Pacific region, including mainland China, has been most severely affected by the disease, but western countries, most notably Canada, also have reported cases. The global interest in the epidemic has pushed science forward, so that, within weeks of the outbreak being identified, the potential causative agent was isolated from several patients with SARS, and the full-length sequence was determined. Genetic analysis identified the agent as a newly emerged coronavirus (CoV) (order Nidovirales, family Coronaviridae, genus Coronavirus), which is different from all previously known groups of CoVs [1, 2].",

SARS is primarily diagnosed by a process of clinical/epidemiological exclusion. Despite improvement in the recent past, laboratory diagnosis, particularly molecular detection of the virus by polymerase chain reaction, remains unreliable, especially in the first few days of the disease; in addition, the tests are not yet validated. Serologic analysis is thought to be the confirmatory laboratory test, but most patients with SARS develop detectable IgG antibody levels 3-4 weeks after the onset of symptoms. Thus, differential diagnosis remains a problem for the clinician at the time of initial presentation, particularly in individuals without known exposure to other patients with SARS or history of travel to a region where SARS is endemic.",

Broad-spectrum antibiotics to treat community-acquired bacterial pneumonia, glucocorticoids, and ribavirin have been administered to patients with SARS, but their efficacy is unknown [3\u20135]. Recently, glycyrrhizin has been demonstrated to inhibit the SARS-related CoV (SARS CoV) in vitro [6]. Ribavirin has been used on the basis of its ability to inhibit other CoVs [7] and also showed an inhibitory effect on several other RNA viruses, such as bunyaviruses and arenaviruses [8]. To support the search for effective antiviral treatments, we evaluated the susceptibility of SARS CoV isolates (detailed studies were performed with the Tor2 isolate [Toronto, Canada]) to ribavirin and interferon (IFN)-\u03b1-2b in vitro. Our data indicate that ribavirin does not inhibit the virus at concentrations attainable in human serum but that IFN-\u03b1-2b may be useful and deserves further evaluation as a therapeutic agent.",

In brief, Vero E6 cells were infected at an MOI of 0.001, either 20 h after or at the time of treatment with IFN-\u03b1- 2b (250-5000 IU/mL). Treatment was continued for 72 h. The CPE was used to demonstrate an antiviral effect. As indicated in figure 1, the CPE on day 3 after infection was significantly decreased in Tor2-infected cultures treated with 1000 IU/mL of IFN-\u03b1-2b in both treatment groups, compared with that in the untreated control group. This indicated that pretreatment was not necessary for the protective effect in tissue culture (data not shown).

After 72 h, cells and supernatants were harvested to determine protein expression by immunoblot analysis and virus yield by plaque titration on Vero E6 cells.

The reduction in virus yield seems to be related to a decrease in virus growth, as supported by the change in the plaque morphology (figure 2B). Inhibition of viral protein expression was investigated by use of immunoblot analysis after SDS-PAGE of the cell lysates (figure 2C). A serum sample from a patient with SARS who seroconverted to the SARS CoV was used to detect viral proteins. Earlier studies had shown that this serum sample reacted strongly with the nucleocapsid protein of the SARS CoV [15].

This is significant, because Vero E6 cells have been shown to have an IFN I gene deficiency and thus are unable to express endogenous IFN I [18]. However, the IFNdependent pathways are functional and can be activated by exogenously provided IFN. We have tested a limited number of different cell lines (HeLa, 293T, 3T3, and CRFK) for susceptibility to the SARS CoV; thus far, we have failed to identify another line that supports viral replication (data not shown). The observation that the Vero cell clone E6 propagates the virus may indeed be related to the lack of a functional IFN system and, thus, supports the findings in the present study.",

Recently, cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis) have been infected with the SARS CoV, which induced similar clinical symptoms and pathological findings to those of humans with SARS [19]. Because only a limited number of animals have been used in the present study, it remains to be determined in the future whether the cynomolgus macaque is a suitable model for SARS and, thus, for antiviral in vivo studies. Until an animal model is definitively established, it might be justified to consider clinical trials with IFN, which is already approved for human use, to determine whether IFN has a beneficial effect on the outcome of SARS CoV infection. Combined with the observation of a lack of efficacy of ribavirin in patients with SARS, our in vitro data further support the conclusion that ribavirin, at least alone, is unlikely to be beneficial in the prophylaxis or treatment of SARS CoV infection. Whether combined therapy with IFN-\u03b1-2b and ribavirin would inhibit the replication of the SARS CoV in vitro has not yet been evaluated; the combination is more effective than either agent used alone for the treatment of HCV infection in humans.",

After 1 h of virus adsorption, the inoculum was removed, and cell monolayers were overlaid with 0.9% low-meltingpoint agarose in DMEM (B2) or DMEM containing 5000 IU/mL of IFNa- 2b (B1). On day 3 after infection, cells were stained with crystal violet. C, Protein analysis. Cell lysates were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE.
