The World Health Organization (WHO) highlighted that the first lines of defense against infectious diseases are behavioral, and risk perception affects behavioral measures. This study investigated risk perception of influenza and the role of sociodemographic and psychological variables on perceived risk. Participants were 442 adults. The research was conducted using three measures: an adjustment of the \"Risk Perception of Infectious Disease Questionnaire,\" the \"General Self-Efficacy Scale,\" and the short form of the \"Italian Personality Inventory.\" The results showed that age, education, self-efficacy, and personality influenced risk perception. The evidence that sociodemographic and psychological factors contribute to risk perception of a disease shows the need to take into account these variables in the planning of informative campaigns, with the aim to achieve favorable changes in public behavior. These issues might have implications for the ameliorating health communication efforts and successful response to new influenza outbreaks.",

However, in several countries such as in Italy, the vaccinal coverage for flu is low (Ministry of Health, Italy, 2016) . Moreover, although the actual context is different from the pandemic context, the A/H1N1 virus continues to present some characteristics that differentiate it from other flu viruses. For this reason, although media attention for this virus decreased in the past years, the vigilance of health authorities remains high. A/H1N1 virus has continued to cause severe cases in the recent years, especially in healthy middle adults and pregnant women (e.g., Chowell et al., 2012; Mishra, 2015) . In this regard, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC; reported high circulation of A/H1N1 virus during 2014. A recrudescent wave of this virus was reported in Mexico in winter 2013 to 2014, and Davila and colleagues (D\u00e1vila et al., 2014) documented an increased number of A/H1N1-related hospitalization and death. In particular, they reported a high proportion of individuals added 30 to 59 years hospitalized with A/H1N1. Similarly, Mishra (2015) reported that in winter 2014 to 2015, pandemic A/ H1N1 virus determined a higher number of cases and deaths than those of the previous flu seasons in India, and WHO (2015) described a widespread activity of the pandemic virus during the first weeks of the 2015 flu season in Italy. In particular, according to the Italian National Surveillance System of Flu (Influnet), the A/H1N1 virus was the most diffuse flu virus during the first 6 weeks of the epidemic in Italy, and it was the dominant virus in the majority of the severe cases.",

Vaccination is, in fact, the most effective mean of mitigating the harmful health care and social effects of influenza. However, despite the availability of flu vaccines, the Italian public's trust in vaccination has declined in the last few years, and influenza vaccination rate has decreased among at-risk adults (Gasparini, Amicizia, & Panatto, 2016) .",

Risk perception influences precautionary actions (Brewer et al., 2007; J. H. Jones & Salathe, 2009; Lau, Griffiths, Choi, & Tsui, 2010; Rubin, Amlot, Page, & Wessely, 2009) , and the literature on severe acute respiratory syndrome suggests that people are more likely to comply with health-related recommendations if they perceive high probability to get a disease (Tang &Wong, 2003) . The health belief model was originally formulated to model the adoption of preventive health behaviors in the United States (Rosenstock, 1974) . The underlying concept of this model is that personal beliefs or perceptions determine health behavior. This model describes six constructs that predict health behavior (C. L. Jones et al., 2015) : perceived seriousness, perceived susceptibility, benefits to action, barriers to action, cues to action, and self-efficacy. \"Seriousness\" and \"susceptibility\" concern the perception of risk for health. Perceived \"seriousness,\" also called severity, concerns the individual belief about the severity of a disease. It is an index of how a person thinks that a disease could be serious for him. Perceived \"susceptibility,\" also called vulnerability, concerns how a person considers himself at risk to have a disease. It comprises two dimensions. The first, \"personal susceptibility,\" is the perceived probability that one will be harmed by a hazard (Rogers, 1983) . The second, \"comparative susceptibility\" is the perceived probability that a hazard will hurt one compared with other people of the same age and gender.",

Conscientious individuals, for example, tend to engage in health-protective behaviors and avoid risky behavior (Bogg & Roberts, 2004; Friedman, 2008; Kern & Friedman, 2011) . The trait of extroversion and conscientiousness was found to have a moderating effect on changes in dangerous behavior, such as smoking behavior, but risk perception was involved in the prediction of the outcomes (Hampson, Andrews, Barckley, Lichtenstein, & Lee, 2006) . Other studies (e.g., Beier & Ackerman, 2003) found that happy and optimistic individuals engage in greater quantity and quality of pleasant activities than neurotic and pessimistic people. Furthermore, openness predicts healthy outcomes. In this regard, a study (Gayg\u0131s\u0131z, Gaygisiz, Ozkan, & Lajunen, 2012) on the behavioral reactions to the A/H1N1 virus during the later stage of the epidemic showed that personality factors moderately influenced the behavioral responses.

The choice to recruit adults who were in a medical waiting room, but were not affected by severe diseases, was derived from the intention to involve study persons who were not seriously ill but were potentially informed on the health measures for the common transmissible pathologies.

The virus continues to cause great complication in middle-aged adults (e.g., Mishra, 2015) and, in some countries, the mean age of hospitalized children with A/ H1N1 influenza is lower than that of the peers affected by other flu viruses (Guan et al., 2015) . For this characteristic, A/H1N1 influenza should be treated differently from other types of flu, for which older adults are the risk group (Dawood et al., 2009) . In this regard, the WHO postpandemic recommendations highlighted that healthy young subjects could continue to be affected disproportionately by severe disease from A/H1N1. The study of D\u00e1vila and colleagues (2014) confirmed this trend. Moreover, the present results also showed that the participants with a low education level believed to be at higher risk, independently of age. This issue is of interest.

The belief that the presence of children in the family did not affect the risk of a disease is contrary to established scientific evidence. It is known in medicine that flu transmission from children to adults in a household is frequent (Fox, Hall, Cooney, & Foy, 1982; Longini, Koopman, Monto, & Fox, 1982) and the size of the household increases the possibility of contracting the virus. Nevertheless, the likelihood that a person of the family can be the cause of transmission of illness is underestimated. Moreover, children are not considered carriers of infection, although they have a high role in the dissemination of influenza in the household and contribute extensively to the spreading of viruses in the population (e.g., Viboud et al., 2004) . Probably parents of children did not take into account that often their sons spend much time in communities, such as school or gym, where the contacts with other children and adults are extensive, with increased risk to get diseases. This unrecognized risk factor, combined with the lack of recommendation for flu vaccination in healthy children, enhances the probability to diffusion of influenza viruses and increases the risk of serious health consequences for specific at-risk groups of people, such as pregnant women.",

Health authorities and media should become aware that educational campaigns developed for a particular group of persons could be inadequate for another group. The lack of differentiation of the informative messages during the prevention's campaign against the pandemic A/H1N1 virus in Italy was probably one of the reasons why people did not understand the actual characteristics of the virus. The educational campaigns during the pandemic in Italy were focused on a character of a cartoon. Indeed, an effective and informative message has to possess structure and characteristics that allow overcoming differences in perceptions associated with the differences in personality profiles. Personality determines the way people feel and perceive the physical, social, and psychological environment, and for this reason, individuals interpret events diversely and respond differently to the same situation. Health services should take into account that a message could be \"read\" diversely by different individuals, and educational campaigns should present information in various forms to reach all people. For example, the previously cited Italian campaign with characters of cartoons may not have been considered worthy of attention by some groups of individuals who do not consider a cartoon as an authoritative source of information.",

However, despite these limitations, the issues of the present study could indicate directions for future research, with the aim to plan educational campaigns that consider the complexity of the factors that modulate their efficacy. WHO (2015) highlighted the need to investigate people perception of the infectious diseases and assess the ability of the communication channels to disseminate adequate information. The present issues showed a misperception of the risk of the influenza viruses. In particular, the actual characteristic of A/H1N1 virus did not influence risk perception. Subjective variables, such as self-efficacy and personality traits, contributed to determining the perception of the risk. This finding might have implications for the ameliorating public health communication efforts and favorable response to a new influenza outbreak.",

The evidence of a pivotal role of sociodemographic and psychological variables in determining people ideas and beliefs on a disease and its diffusion highlights the need to carefully design informative campaigns that take into account all the variables that contribute to determining the personal way the informative message is received. This meticulous planning could allow to avoiding that the beliefs about a disease and risk perception depend on personal variables instead of objective variables, such as the actual features of a disease. Health authorities should consider these aspects in their risk communication with the public. Surveillance of perceptions and a better understanding of the role of specific variables in risk perception among the general population will provide useful information for health risk communication and achieve successful changes in public behavior. The future research might better define the role of the contribution of personality and self-efficacy on risk perception, and better investigate how the role of these variables is limited by other concomitant factors, such as previous illness or the habit to vaccination. As Freimuth and Quinn (2004) have highlighted, health communication can increase awareness of a health issue; influence beliefs, attitudes, or behavior; show the benefit of behavior change; and refute myths and misconception. Systematic variations in messages, to increase relevance for different audience segments, should guide planning of the educational campaign.",
