The breakage of a water main could have far reaching consequences, including intangible costs that can have a significant effect upon the wider community. Not only could such an event have immediate disastrous impacts to the surrounding area, there would also be long-term socio-economic impact on power, water and other supplies to suburbs. Figure 1 (a) shows a sinkhole which has swallowed cars (and three houses have been flooded) after a water main burst in Port Melbourne. This shows potential consequences stemming from a burst pipeline. The burst failures in the water main network in a region in Australia is shown in Fig. 1 (b). Across the entire region under our study, an average number of 400 pipe failures occur each year, causing water supply disruptions and myriads of property and environmental damages. Even while this manuscript was being drafted, two water main bursts have severely affected up to 60 houses in Sydney, Australia, within just 5 days apart [1]. A recent report from the Australian Infrastructure Statistics Yearbook indicates that the maintenance cost for water assets is over 1.4 billion Australian dollars in Australia [3].\n",

Generally, water authorities develop risk based approaches in order (1) to avoid critical water pipe failures by prioritizing renewal of specific pipes; but also (2) to avoid replacing any pipe that is still in good working condition. To effectively achieve these objectives, machine learning techniques can be used with the advancement of Artificial Intelligence. Furthermore, the prediction estimation is expected to be long-term for the structural deterioration of water mains to effectively plan the renewal of water distribution systems and to develop risk based investment decisions for capital interventions.",

In that study, the authors used a Poisson model based on the age of the pipes. Most recently, tree-based machine learning techniques have been used to predict water pipe failure rates in VIC (Victoria) [26] and (Queensland) [16], Australia and Syracuse, USA [14]. However, tree based models are generally not capable to provide accurate predictions for extremely sparse components [15], such as a critical water main. Furthermore, prediction of water main breaks has been studied using survival-based methods, such as Poisson regression and Weibull model [2]. Survival analysis focuses on the study of time-to-event data, usually called survival times. These models are usually limited by their fixed model structure and their inability to adaptively adjust the model to the complexity of the problem. There is also a vast literature of estimating hazard function in survival analysis using Bayesian nonparametric techniques [11]. Even though these algorithms are flexible, it cannot incorporate expert knowledge which is fundamental for applications like pipe failure prediction [7]. The work reported in [8] defines a Gaussian process prior over the hazard function which models the hazard function as the multiplication of a parametric baseline hazard and a nonparametric part. In our proposed method, we model survival function on a set of clusters (based on pipe laid years) to predict the future pipe breakage. This parametric component is then embedded into the prior and likelihood of a Gaussian Process.",

            "text": "Although there is significant existing literature, there still exist open questions regarding intricate relationships among the major factors causing pipe failure, and their long-term effect on the life-time of a pipe. Thus, prediction of water main breaks becomes a complicated task due to their low failure rate and high cost of inspection, which have led to sparse historical data. As such, the underlying function which governs the pipeline failure rates is fairly sophisticated, making it difficult to obtain a suitable model by looking only at the input data. Therefore, a nonparametric prediction method like GPR is more suitable [19]. Such methods allow the data to speak for itself and require minimal assumptions on the data. Nevertheless, regression can face issues when dataset is very sparse. When we consider the datasets obtained from Australian water utilities, the general 10\u201312 year observation period was relatively short compared to the life cycle of water pipes (which could be more than 100 years), so that most (about 99%) pipes do not fail or fail just once during the observation period, making the data sparse (despite the low failure rate, the failure of a critical water main could lead to heavy financial losses). Trying to learn a flexible model with a few data points may result in overfitting where the model mistakes artefacts of the specific available samples as actual properties of the underlying distribution [4, 25]. When forecasting water main failures we encounter this issue, with the sparse incident data. Our proposed approach aims to solve limitations of these commonly used machine learning techniques.",

In addition, as our model is based on GPR which is a special class of nonparametric Bayesian probabilistic modelling, it provides a distribution instead of a point forecast. Therefore, we will have a point forecast (the mean of the distribution) as well as the uncertainty which can be obtained from the variance of the distribution. As a result, for each pipe failure probability that is predicted with a GPR, we are given the perceived uncertainty of that prediction.",

The quality review demonstrates that the data is sufficient and accurate for further analysis. Accordingly, this process allows to establish a comprehensive data file with complete information for each asset that can be used as an important input to further analysis. In addition, environmental and demographic factors need to be matched with the network data. Specifically, failure records and information are assigned to the corresponding assets based on the work order number, and environmental and demographic information are assigned to the assets based on the geographic locations. To quantify the underlying factors affecting pipe failures, in each of the factor in isolation, we calculate the mutual information between the \u2018Pipe Failure\u2019 parameter and each feature (we have selected a primary set of asset specific features). Pipe size (or diameter) shares the highest amount of mutual information with failures while pipe type has the least effect on failures. In general, all predictors by themselves display very low levels of mutual information indicating that by themselves, they do not predict failures sufficiently well. However, as we shall show later in the experiment section, the six features (material, diameter, age, length, historical failures, laid year) in unison will provide us with a much more accurate prediction model of pipe failures.",

In addition to collectively considering the aforementioned feature set, we intend to further improve the proposed GPR procedure by incorporating the estimated survival probability of each pipe in the prior and likelihood of the predictive posterior. For this purpose, we aim to populate a newly calculated survival probability estimate feature in both our training and test datasets. The Kaplan-Meier estimate is considered as one of the most widely used non-parametric estimators of the survival function S(t). It has often been utilized to estimate the survival probabilities when the inputs include censored data [5, 20]. For censored subjects, the event occurred (or will occur) sometime after the date of last follow-up. However, it is not customary to ignore these subjects, as they provide some information about survival: it is known that they survived beyond a certain point, although the exact timing of the event is unknown [9]. We will first utilize the available training data to obtain the non-parametric Kaplan-Meier survival estimate as [13],1\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$\\begin{aligned} \\hat{S}(t) = \\prod _{t_i<t}\\frac{n_i-f_i}{n_i}, \\end{aligned}$$\\end{document}where \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$f_i$$\\end{document} denotes number of failure events at time t, \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$t_i$$\\end{document} denotes a time when at least one event occurred and \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$n_i$$\\end{document} is the number of subjects at risk of failure just prior to time t. Using this model, we can successfully obtain the survival probability estimates for all pipe ages spanned by the training dataset. We would need to extrapolate the estimated survival probability function to traverse beyond the training age span, for the purpose of testing the final GPR model. As the Kaplan-Meier model is not suitable for the purpose of extrapolation, we sought a parametric model which closely aligned with the Kaplan-Meier estimate along the training age span. As we shall show later in our results section, the Weibull survival probability estimate [23] fulfills this requirement. The Weibull survival probability is a continuous function featured by two parameters, namely, the scale parameter and the shape parameter. Due to these two parameters functioning simultaneously, the Weibull model provides a parametric distribution with additional flexibility compared to models with single parameters such as the exponential distribution [17]. The Weibull survival probability estimate is obtainable as [22],2\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$\\begin{aligned} \\hat{S}_w(t) = p(T>t) = \\exp {\\left[ -\\left( \\frac{t}{\\alpha }\\right) ^\\beta \\right] } \\end{aligned}$$\\end{document}where \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$\\alpha >0$$\\end{document} and \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$\\beta >0$$\\end{document} denote the scale and shape parameters.

We used the full training dataset for this purpose, assuming that each failure could be treated as a first time failure (which allows to compute the age at failure starting from the actual laid date for the pipe) and obtained the Kaplan-Meier survival curve depicted in Fig. 3 (b). We then considered parametric survival models to extrapolate the survival probabilities beyond the maximum observed age in the inputs (training data), for the purpose of populating the survival probability feature in the testing data. It was evident that Weibull survival probability given by Eq. (2) closely aligns with the Kaplan-Meier survival estimate for the training age span, as depicted by Fig. 3 (b). Thus, we obtained the extrapolated Weibull survival probability estimates for the full age span (15 to 46) using the same assumptions, and only the training data as inputs.

For this study, the suburbs within a state are first sorted, based on the cumulative probability of all the pipes within the suburb for a given prediction year. This forms a suburb based dataset and the general procedure is then followed to obtain the suburb based ROC curve. In the suburb based analysis, we notice that by the aggregation of pipe failure probabilities predicted by proposed model across suburbs, we were able to predict a significant proportion of pipe failures. In Fig. 3 (c), we clearly see that when we inspect top 10 risky suburbs, 60%\u201370% of the pipe failures were recovered. Our analysis of critical suburbs also reveals quite interesting facts regarding pipe failures and their distribution across suburbs. As Fig. 3 (c) demonstrates, the proposed model performs well in precisely recalling suburbs with greater-than-average numbers of failures in all 5 years into the future. These results suggest that in a given year, the pipe failures are clustered in a few vulnerable suburbs. Prediction uncertainty for the long-term failure prediction has been obtained and illustrated with the mean prediction and actual failure rates as shown in Fig. 3 (d)-(e) for AC (Asbestos Cement), PVC (Plasticized Polyvinyl Chloride) separately. These long-term prediction curves show that actual failure rates align with the results generated by the prediction model and lie within the uncertainty interval. The mean failure prediction is ideal for modelling future behaviour of pipeline network benchmarking performance indices such as unplanned water interruption and water main breaks. In addition to the mean prediction, all the water utilities require uncertainty interval of the prediction. This is required to evaluate the impact and cost of more targeted water network levels of service to inform both short and long-term renewals budgets.",
