Effectively control measures are urged needed. Here, we showed that homoharringtonine treatment exhibited a strong inhibitory effect against two different strains of FMDVs (O/MYA98/BY/2010 and A/GD/MM/2013) in swine kidney (IBRS-2) cells. Further experiments demonstrated that homoharringtonine did not affect virus attachment or entry. Using time-of-addition assays, we found that the antiviral activity of homoharringtonine occurred primarily during the early stage of infection. These results demonstrated that homoharringtonine might be an effective anti-FMDV drug. Further studies are required to explore the antiviral activity of homoharringtonine against FMDV replication in vivo.

To date, a number of compounds including silvestrol, 7 hippuristanol, 8 rocaglamide, 9 elisabatin, and allolaurintenol 10 have been identified to have a specific effect on inhibiting the translation process. Homoharringtonine is known to inhibit the first cycle of the elongation phase of eukaryotic translation. 11, 12 Homoharringtonine was used in China for the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and other types of tumor diseases for the past 30 years. 13 Besides that, homoharringtonine was reported to exhibit antiviral activity, such as hepatitis B virus (HBV), bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), chikungunya virus, mouse hepatitis coronavirus, varicella-zoster virus, vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), Newcastle disease virus (NDV), porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), type 1 herpes simplex virus (HSV-1), and pseudorabies virus (PRV). [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] All of these characteristics make homoharringtonine an attractive candidate for development as an antiviral therapeutic, but its activity against FMDV remains unexplored. In the current study, the inhibitory effect of homoharringtonine on FMDV replication in IBRS-2 cells was demonstrated. Also, this study investigated potential mechanisms by which the homoharringtonine could exert its antiviral effects and provided preliminary evidence for its possible use as an antiviral agent during the early stage of viral infection.

Figure 6A and 6B indicated that homoharringtonine did not exhibit any significant inhibiting capacity against FMDV at binding and entry stages. To further determine at which time after infection We observed that viral attachment and entry were not affected by the treatment of homoharringtonine. Time-of-addition studies were also performed to identify the window in the FMDV replication cycle when homoharringtonine exhibited its antiviral effect. Our study revealed F I G U R E 5 Evaluation of the effects of homoharringtonine by IFA. After the cells infected with FMDV O/MYA98/BY/2010 at an MOI of 1 for 1 hour, IBRS-2 cells were treated with the indicated concentrations of homoharringtonine at 37\u00b0C for 12 hours or 0.025% DMSO (mock). IFA was performed and fluorescence was observed using a fluorescent microscope. DMSO, dimethyl sulfoxide; IFA, immunofluorescence assay F I G U R E 6 Homoharringtonine has no effect on virus attachment and entry. A, Relative viral RNA levels of cells treated with homoharringtonine (6.2, 12.5, and 25 \u03bcM) at the viral attachment stage. B, Relative viral RNA levels of cells treated with homoharringtonine (6.2, 12.5, and 25 \u03bcM) at the viral entry stage. Differences in suppression, compared with the DMSO group, were assessed with an analysis of variance followed by Student t tests. Data were expressed as mean \u00b1 SD from three independent experiments that homoharringtonine remained potent when added at post infection from 0 hours to 8 hours post infection, indicating that the inhibitory effect of homoharringtonine on FMDV replication occurred primarily at the early stages. Similar result was also obtained from the study of Dong et al, 17 in their study, they found that homoharringtonine play its roles in the viral replication cycle after viral entry.",

In this study, we found that homoharringtonine exerts antiviral activity against FMDV, a porcine Picornaviridae, including two different strains of FMDV. Therefore, this study broadened our understanding of the characteristics of its antiviral activity. Further study is needed to investigate the inhibitory effect of homoharringtonine on FMDV infections in vivo.",

Previously it has been shown that homoharringtonine had an antiviral effect on several RNA virus. However, inhibition was not previously reported in FMDV. This study initially investigated whether homoharringtonine could be used as a potential antiviral agent for FMDV. First, homoharringtonine, within a certain range of concentrations, had no significant toxicity in IBRS-2 cells (Figure 2) or significant effects on cell morphology (data no shown). After homoharringtonine treatment, the viral DNA and viral protein levels were strongly inhibited in a dose-dependent manner, as confirmed by q-PCR, Western Blot, and IFA assays. These results supported that homoharringtonine inhibited FMDV infection of IBRS-2 cells. Generally, the viral life contains several stages, such as the attachment to cells, entry into cells, and replication in the nucleus. Among them, viral attaches to specific receptors on cells consists of the initial step for the viral life cycle, while, the attachment step is important for virus host tropism. These stages of the viral life cycle were investigated after homoharringtonine treatment in the present study.",
