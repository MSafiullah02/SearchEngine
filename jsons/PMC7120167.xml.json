It is, for instance, in the immunitary technology of transplantation that \u2018flesh needs to be rethought outside of Christian language\u2019 he writes (2008a, 168). By this, he means that the negative category of flesh becomes, in biotechnology, \u2018a non-Christian form of incarnation\u2026 a technological transmutation of the human body\u2019 (ibid.). What it is that animates matter is no longer classically \u2018divine\u2019 but instead \u2018the organ of another person; or something that doesn\u2019t live, that \u2018divinely\u2019 allows the person to live\u2019 (ibid.).",

He is, for instance, guided by Haraway\u2019s observation that it is the very \u2018heart of biopolitics\u2019 which is expressed in the shifting sands of immunology (Esposito 2011, 149). He pays tribute to her attention to the way immunology increasingly fragments the body\u2019s parameters.

Nancy\u2019s experience of \u2018intrusion\u2019 is probably, Esposito writes, \u2018the most radical and at the same time the most sobering state of awareness regarding the meaning of the technicity of one\u2019s body\u2019 (2011, 151\u20132). Nancy is famously unromantic and ambivalent about the sentiments of mutual solidaristic reciprocity that are now somehow supposed to connect him to his donor. He is instead preoccupied with his own loss, with the loaded debt of the recipient. L\u2019Intrus is uniquely experienced by the recipient rather than the \u2018donor\u2019. Communitas becomes an intrusion, an incursion into the very corporeal fabric of the recipient\u2019s body: \u2018the whole dubious symbolism of the gift of the other\u2014a secret, ghostly complicity or intimacy between the other and me\u2014wears out very quickly\u2019 (2008, 166).",

Put in another way, in most instances of transplantation, the immunitas of the few comes to depend upon the communitas of the many. The advancing bioeconomies of immune system innovation deepen this dynamic interpenetration of immunitas and communitas, life and death. As Nancy puts it, \u2018this type of condition concerns more and more other bodies\u2026 the sick, the aged, compromised, handicapped, assisted, pieced-together bodies\u2019 (1997, 158).",

But instead of seeking to dispel these risks by pretending their remoteness, Nancy\u2019s point is that we must immerse ourselves in the ambivalence arising from the interconnection of immunitas and communitas, life and death. He goes on to caution against the banishment of death from life: \u2018Isolating death from life\u2014without leaving one intimately entwined with the other, and each intruding upon the heart of the other\u2014this we must never do\u2019 (Nancy 2008, 165). Instead, the role of an affirmative immunitary analysis lies in recovering the intimately entwined intrusion of one upon the other. Tierney (2016) sees here, in Nancy\u2019s entreaty, some semblance of Esposito\u2019s affirmative aspirations for biopolitics in calling for an \u2018intense sense of communitas\u2019 exercised \u2018no longer over life but of life\u2019 (Esposito 2008a, 157).",

It is important to do this because of the way transplantation both reconfigures and re-entrenches notions of difference and similarity, of distinction and connection, of opposition and resemblance, of disparity and affinity, of immunity and community. Again, building on the previous chapter, it goes without saying that the modern biopolitics of race is, at the same time, a biopolitics of species and even interspeciesness (Dillon and Lobo-Guerrero 2009). It is against the backcloth of race that I want to outline a biopolitics of transpecies transplantation.",

In the tumultuous moment in which Martin Luther King is assassinated, and in which two Olympian medallists stage their black panther protest, apartheid South Africa becomes a flashpoint in culturally transgressive surgical medicine. Christian Bernard performs the first \u2018successful\u2019 heart transplantation in late 1967 and repeated the following year in a far more contentious expression of apartheid racial biopolitics. The recipient, a European Jewish dentist, is transplanted with the heart of Clive Haupt, a legally designated \u2018coloured\u2019 twenty-four-year-old male. It is deeply significant that the white recipient had to give specific consent given that the heart in question was not \u2018white\u2019. Nor could it be guaranteed that the heart in question was straightforwardly \u2018human\u2019, given that Haupt\u2019s ancestry might conceivably be traced to the \u2018Hottentot\u2019.

Politicians to the right of the political spectrum quipped about how Haupt had posthumously violated apartheid legislation, specifically the Group Areas Act of 1950. The Act and related legislation spatially excluded blacks from dominions occupied or frequented by whites. That structure of laws however went beyond the external control of bodily space, penetrating deep into the body itself through the legislative control of sex and reproduction. The Immorality Amendment Act of 1950 proscribed extramarital intercourse between whites and non-whites taking apartheid into the flesh of its subjects. The transplantation of Haupt\u2019s heart across the frontiers of race had constitutionally confounded laws of bodily interpenetration and space. Global news coverage consistently played on these ironies, and especially the inherent contradictions between biomedical facts and biopolitical laws.

Opondo writes that, \u2018integrating body parts from people of different races\u2026 raised crucial questions about exceptions to apartheid policies, the integrity of bodies and the value of life\u2019 (2015, 3). In an edition of Ebony magazine, the writer notes that \u2018Clive Haupt\u2019s heart will ride in the uncrowded train coaches marked \u201cFor Whites Only\u201d instead of in the crowded ones reserved for blacks \u2026 to hundreds of places where Haupt himself could not go because his skin was a little darker than that of Blaiberg\u2019 (10 March 1968, in Opondo 2015, 7). The obvious dynamics of exploitation exacted upon black labouring bodies were now seen to extend into the body itself. The event served as a focal point for morbid suspicions of racially organised medical experimentalism (Scheper-Hughes 2007).

But it is also an event made possible and legitimised because of the way social community and biological immunity are made to depart from one another. The former sustains a striation of biopolitical difference unequally segregating and demarcating members of the community. The latter, biological immunity, introduces a new register of sameness. This cleaving apart of politics from biology occurs in such a way that the immunitary similarity of transplantation comes to depend upon the biopolitical segmentation of community. For Opondo, the Haupt event is expressed through a complex \u2018dialectics\u2019 between otherwise opposed dimensions of sameness and difference, between immunity and community, between the indispensable and the expendable:",

But the crucial point for this analysis of immunitary life is to better understand the pragmatic separation of immunity from community, the biomedical from the biopolitical. It is also critical to understand the way in which this separation is subsequently redeployed in the advancement of sometimes culturally troubling immunitary biosciences. Immunological innovation in transplantation and related fields is one fundamentally characterised by, within certain limits, a qualified erasure of difference, the creation of a kind of questionable commonness. Transplantation is continually cited as illustrative of this blurring of immunitary boundaries between bodies and across species. When Tauber (1998) writes of the ascendency of a more dynamic and permeable perspective on the immune system in immunology, he rightly cites the influence of 1970s and 1980s transplant \u2018pioneers\u2019 like Tom Starzl amongst others. Fittingly for the discussion that follows below, Starzl played a leading early role in championing the promise and potential of xenotransplantation using non-human primates, pigs and other species. The idea that \u2018we\u2019 now share a new inter-humanness or interspeciesness is a pervasive, but not unproblematic, trope in the immunitary biosciences and in biopolitical scholarship. That levelling rips its way through, for example, metric discourse in genomics in which other species are said to share x-number of genes or mutations or whatever with humans (see Marks 2003; Holmberg 2005; Brown 2009).",

This patterning of \u2018sameness and difference\u2019 in the context of xenotransplantation was a focus for much of my work on biopolitics throughout the late 1990s and into 2000s (Brown 1999a, b; Brown and Michael 2001; Michael and Brown 2005). Questions of sameness and difference, for me, articulate themselves most strongly in debates about which source species would be more appropriate than another for transplantation into humans. What I called the \u2018which species debate\u2019 in the science and policy of xenotransplantation focused, at various times, on a number of closely or distantly related species including varieties of primates, pigs and other species. Themes of species desirability and undesirability remain enduring biopolitical issues in the still advancing fields of transpecies biomedicine (Cook 2013).

Chimpanzees were used in a number of kidney transplants in 1963 performed by Hitchcock and Reemtsma, and in the very first heart transplantation performed in 1964 by Hardy. With poor evidence of therapeutic efficacy, xenotransplantation procedures dropped away considerably from the late 1960s and into the early 1980s. It is however important not to lose sight of the extent to which the politics of race continues to define xenotransplantation throughout this period (see Opondo 2015; Kierans 2015). With parallels to Barnard\u2019s work in South Africa, much of the early work on xenotransplantation takes place in the Southern states of the US especially Virginia, Mississippi and Louisiana. Reemtsma\u2019s early clinical transplantation work was conducted at Tulane in Louisiana where it could be argued both primates (chimpanzees) and black patients were seen to share an adjacent cultural locus as experimental objects. Implicit in a number of programmes was the idea that therapeutic success would be more likely between non-whites and primates than with Caucasoids. As Sharp points out, \u2018vulnerable Blacks apparently served at key moments as human species proxies during the provisional and transitional testing of inter-species kinship. If a chimp\u2019s heart or kidneys could function in a black body, perhaps these organs might function in the bodies of any human being\u2019 (Sharp 2011, 26). Reemtsma was also institutionally located at a charity hospital where there was a much greater likelihood of treating deprived black populations.",

Gould, Bailey\u2019s \u2018chilling\u2019 remark highlighted profound confusion in what it means to be evolutionarily \u2018homologous\u2019 or merely \u2018similar\u2019. For Gould, the very idea of homology fell between at least two meanings. For biochemists, it meant sharing similar sequences of DNA. But for evolutionary biologists, it meant descendance from a common ancestor. It is, he writes, the \u2018quality of relationships based on evolutionary descent\u2019 that should be taken as the measure of our relationships to other species (ibid., 30). Genetic homology was not, he argued, the same as evolutionary homology. Bailey, Gould suggested, had confused mere \u2018similarity\u2019 with \u2018homology\u2019, mistakenly placing trust in genetics over that of evolution. More polemically, Gould pointed out that just because \u2018birds, bats, and pterodactyls all bear wings with common aerodynamic properties\u2019, it does not follow that they share an ancestry (ibid.).

Success would come to depend, it was argued, on the closest possible immunitary and evolutionary homology between source and recipient species. It is this naturalised biological affinity which makes other simians so compelling in the twentieth century scientific imaginary (Haraway 1989). Simians are thus positioned, in the physiological and behavioural disciplines, as proxies par excellence for humans. The very legitimacy and success of those enterprises comes to rest equally upon the erasure of difference and the assertion of sameness.

In 1995, the AIDS patient Jeff Getty is transplanted with the bone marrow cells of a baboon in an attempt to reinvigorate his failing immune system. Putting aside the pejorative references to \u2018baboon boy\u2019 in the press (Cooper and Lanza 2000, 201), baboon haematopoietic stem cells were known to be resistant to HIV infection. In other words, what made the approach conceivably possible were the very same homological differences that had made Bailey\u2019s baboon transplant impossible. Both events sparked increasing awareness amongst virologists beyond the worlds of clinical transplantation that xenografting might in fact replicate the very same species intimacies that had given rise to HIV in the first place. As one of the key virologists in the debate put it: \u2018simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIV) appear to have low if any pathogenicity in their natural African primate hosts, but lead to fatal acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) in Asian macaques and, sadly, after adaptation to become HIV in humans\u2019 (Weiss et al. 2000).",

This is the contradictory double-bind that runs through the logics of xenotransplantation, a collision between being adequately and excessively close.

Apes and monkeys embody the rehearsal of humanness itself in both popular and expert representation (Strum and Latour 1987; Haraway 1989; Schubert and Masters 1991). Indeed, primate imaginaries, as Haraway notes, routinely involve the rehearsal of cultural concerns surrounding race, segregation, class, gender and social taboo. Much of the biomedical discourse surrounding the problematic use of other primates in xenotransplantation refers to their rich emotional lives, their complex sociality, and so on. One of the first influential advisory reports on xenotransplantation makes the point that other primates share many of \u2018the features qualifying human beings for personhood\u2026 including self-awareness, complex social relationships and many of the other characteristics that have often been supposed to make human beings unique\u2019 (Nuffield 1996, 39).

Very rarely do they become companions, pets or sources of meat. Instead, our \u2018closest cousins\u2019 occupy a distantly remote mythical space in our interspecies imaginary. For this reason, the Nuffield report (1996) drew a distinction between \u2018relatedness\u2019 and \u2018relationship\u2019. In other words, relationships or affinity with other species does not necessarily follow from being related or evolutionarily linked to them.

What is fascinating here is the constant rehearsal of the case for pigs, the incessant need to explain, justify, rationalise and defend. It is this uninterrupted rearticulation that is at once a witness to deeper ambivalence about the place of pigs as ongoing sites of cultural and scientific risk. In what follows, it becomes possible to see into the intense material and discursive work still required to diffuse or normalise those risks. Again, what is most significant is the creation of a particular contrasting patterning of sameness and difference constructed between pigs and humans. In the first place, a shared immunitas, or sameness-making, between source and recipient species has come to depend on a natural/scientific/functional repertoire. But at the same time, a cultural, social or moral repertoire of difference-making is intended to exile the pig from the communitas of the human.",

This and similar events have been taken as expressions of contrasting biopolitical conditions distributed between \u2018core\u2019 and \u2018peripheral\u2019 regulatory spaces. The Montreal-based International Xenotransplantation Association was vocal in taking the opportunity to endorse its own standards of biosecurity, whilst censuring those of others: \u2018Without organised international cooperation, the best efforts at minimizing these risks in countries with appropriate regulatory oversight may be thwarted by the free travel of individuals undergoing unmonitored XTP in countries lacking such regulation\u2019 (Sykes et al. 2004, 119). The episode also drew attention to the disproportionate exploitability of different racial and economic populations. Disadvantaged children whose families, it was argued, found it difficult to pay for insulin had been recruited to the study (Persson and Welin 2008). It also highlighted the iniquitous dimensions of \u2018xenotourism\u2019 between rich and poor countries already touched upon above. A number of those treated had travelled and paid considerable sums for inclusion in a trial which was seen to put individual privilege above population protection. In this way, xenografting operates through an uneven and exploitable \u2018spatiality of biopoliticised flesh\u2019 as Esposito puts it (2008a, 160), resulting in the production of highly unstable \u2018pathogenic spaces\u2019 (Bewell 2003).

In this context, risks to wider populations are seen to extend across the lengthy legacy periods of the lifecourse or even transgenerationally into remote futures. A number of national and international regulatory measures have evolved to explicitly require the lifelong surveillance of xenograft recipients. Not without precedent, biosecurity here comes into conflict with established conventions protecting civil liberties including the right to withdraw from clinical trials enshrined in the Declaration of Helsinki. US Guidelines on xenozoonotic infectious diseases mandate recipient compliance with \u2018lifelong surveillance necessitating routine physical evaluations and the archiving of tissue and/or body fluid specimens for public health purposes even if the experiment fails and the xenotransplantation product is rejected or removed\u2019 (FDA 2001, 21). Arrangements would need to be made for the archiving of such specimens for a minimum, it is stated, of fifty years. Recipients would be further required to consent to \u2018the responsibility to educate his/her close contacts regarding the possibility of xenogeneic infections\u2019 (ibid.). \u2018Close contacts\u2019 are defined as those with whom a recipient may, as a matter of routine, share intimate contact resulting in the exchange of bodily fluids. They would therefore be obliged not to engage in \u2018unsafe\u2019 sexual practices and be subject to the same criminal liabilities that apply in some cases of HIV transmission. Clinical trial sponsors would be forced to document the identities of sexual contacts and immediate intimates for the purposes of subsequent tracing and monitoring. Monitoring would extend beyond death to include the compulsory autopsy of recipients. In these and other intricate respects, the FDA\u2019s guidelines are very detailed in the minutiae measures involved in the containment of an otherwise boundless pathogenic riskiness.",

That protection, or the fragile appearance of it at least, necessitates a retreat, a form of custody or capture within the bureaucratic administrative apparatus of surveillant traceability. The illimitability of flesh and the unruliness of its microbiological intimacies are in this way catalogued, recorded and archived. In denying the right to withdraw from the clinical trial, the recipient becomes permanently fixed within it. And yet it does not take a great leap of imagination to appreciate the practical contingencies upon which this brittle security depends. Much has to be taken on trust including \u2018compliance\u2019 with containment, with restrictions of movement, sex, intimacy and scrutiny. To what extent is this immunitary framework capable of forever guaranteeing against subsequent violation, regret, refusal, withdrawal from confinement, intended or unintended intimacies? Esposito conceives of such limits as the end of sovereignty, the point at which biopolitics is pushed beyond the bounds of its self-defined capacities for containment and control (2008a, b).

In Derrida\u2019s terms, we are able to see into the deconstructive undoing of competing immunitary mandates, principally that of the individual in conflict with that of the population. Clinical benefit comes to depend on the sacrifice of other protections including the imaginary of the sovereign self enshrined in codes of \u2018consent\u2019, \u2018autonomy\u2019 and \u2018self-determination\u2019. Nor can the protection of the communitas be achieved without the likely possibility of its endangerment, the reassertion of individual entitlements resulting in the haunting threat of microbial leakiness.

In thinking through the limits of affirmative and negating immunity, Esposito writes of the collapsing fate of the inner and outer body. Immunity risks the negation of life when it \u2018increases to the point\u2019 such that it passes a \u2018threshold\u2019 turning into \u2018its opposite\u2019. In xenozoonosis, it could be argued, \u2018the negative protection of life will end up destroying, along with the enemy outside, its own body\u2019 (Esposito 2012, 64). Esposito and Derrida have in mind the way inner protections destroy themselves in the process of destroying that which lies in an outer beyond. Here, however, it is the selective preservation of life \u2018within\u2019 which indiscriminately now threatens the \u2018without\u2019. There is therefore something deeply poignant in Esposito\u2019s scepticism of life immunised against death. As he puts it, \u2018the only way for life to defer death isn\u2019t to preserve it as such (perhaps in the immunitary form of negative protection) but rather to be reborn continually in different guises\u2019 (2008a, b, 181). The object of critique here is that tendency in immunitary life towards the extremes of frozen self-preservation, of life immunised against death. Clearly immunitary technologies like that of xenotransplantation are premised on profound immunitary plasticity and innovation across species boundaries. But they also come to depend on negating and contradictory stances towards newly embodied interspecies intimacies.",

Conceivably, in this case it is an over-determined bureaucratic biosecurity that makes possible couplings which jeopardise biosecurity itself. As we have seen, for Derrida, it is the denial and repression of threat through immunity which makes those threats all the more dangerous. Immunitary protections eviscerate the enemy from awareness, without ever really overcoming the underlying fretful anxiety of danger. The denied other is already within and literally so in the case of the xenograft. The sequestration of the recipient, their fixing within immunitary space, can never be wholly guaranteed. Instead, the measures outlined by the FDA above may be taken as an unwelcome reminder of a recurring dread, of a dangerous recoiling excess returning to unravel protection. In these kinds of terms, Derrida reminds us of our need for protection from self-protection, or as Rottenberg has put it \u2018protection beyond self-protection\u2019 (Rottenberg 2006, 13). In deconstructive autoimmunity, there are opportunities for critical re-examination, for more productive and potentially affirmative openings.

For Latour, rapidly reproducing and systemic hybrids can be dangerous, even catastrophic (climate change, BSE, nanoparticles, recombinant organisms, etc.) and are evidence of the underlying hidden connections between humans and non-humans, and especially false separations between \u2018objective\u2019 science and \u2018subjective\u2019 politics. Here, sometimes dangerous hybrids proliferate in the disconnected spaces between politics (institutions, bureaucracies, administrations, etc.) and science (biotechnologies, natures, life, etc.). The boundaries of the modern constitution are premised upon forms of purification and cleansing in which lines, boundaries, limits and borders are drawn. Laws, guidelines and institutions may seek to regulate the movement of risky agents, capricious microbes and unruly practitioners. And yet it is the very act of purification itself that leads to the confounding and disruptive proliferation of a whole universe of complex hybrids and novel risks. Purification provides its own subversion. Purity begets translation and therefore hybridity. Such monsters are dissident creatures expressing the unsettled irreducibility of things. Hybrids may, sometimes, hold positive potential in forcing we moderns to recognise the contradictions of our modern constitutional arrangements. For example, those contradictions embodied in post-xenograft biosecurity arrangements. Hybridity in turn negates purity. But on the other hand, hybrids evidently harbour profound risks in terms of damage, violence, rejection and contagion. Xenografts have the potential to come apart both biologically and therefore also institutionally and constitutionally. Given these and other dystopic prospects, Latour calls for a slowing down of the proliferation of hybrids, a deceleration whereby space is created for hybrids to be acknowledged and represented \u2018officially\u2019 within the \u2018parliament of things\u2019, in regulatory process and deliberation (1993, 12). These themes of pathogenicity and our efforts to fix, arrest and contain the threat are taken forward in the next chapter on antimicrobial resistance (AMR).
