Essentially no 6 replication occurs in the absence of activation. When administered to mice, localized 7 application of a transient heat treatment in the presence of systemic antiprogestin 8 results in efficient but limited virus replication at the site of administration.

Unactivated viral vectors -which may be regarded as equivalents of inactivated 11 vaccines -induced detectable protection against lethality caused by wildtype virus 12 challenge. Single activation of the viral vectors at the site of administration (rear 13 footpads) greatly enhanced protective immune responses, and second immunization 14 resulted in complete protection.

Immunization will then occur in the context of highly efficient 7 pathogen replication and uncompromised safety. We found that localized activation in 8 mice of efficient but limited replication of a replication-competent controlled herpesvirus 9 vector resulted in a greatly enhanced immune response to the virus or an expressed 10 heterologous antigen.

Our hypothesis is in part based on the rational 8 expectation that an efficiently replicating virus will produce a stronger inflammatory 9 response than an attenuated virus, which inflammatory response will result in a potent 10 activation of the innate immune system and, consequently, in strong and lasting B and T 11 cell responses (27) . To realize such an immunization strategy, a regulation system must 12 be employed that reliably and stringently controls viral replication as well as is capable 13 of being turned on and off at will. However, virus disseminates after administration. 14 Simply restricting the number of replication cycles will not be enough: depending on the 15 number of cycles allowed, there will be a more or less pronounced manifestation of the 16 toxicity typical for the viral vector used. For example, allowing an HSV-1 vector to 17 replicate for a certain period of time may cause unacceptable neurotoxicity. Hence, the 18 regulation system must be capable of exerting regional control over viral replication so 19 that the immunizing virus only replicates in a locale in which it is certain not to cause a 20 disease phenotype. HSV-GS7 replication was also tightly controlled in vivo, two of three groups of mice 8 were administered HSV-GS7 virus (50,000 pfu per mouse) to the footpad, and the mice 9 of one of the latter groups were given ulipristal intraperitoneally (i,p.) as well as, 3 h 10 later, were subjected to a heat treatment to the footpads at 45 0 C for 10 min. One day 11 later, all mice were euthanized, and DNA and RNA were extracted from their feet and 12 analyzed by qPCR and RT-qPCR, respectively. Substantially larger amounts of HSV-1 13 DNA were detected in the feet of heat/ulipristal-treated mice than in not-treated mice 14 (Fig. 1D ). Expression of several viral genes was observed for activated virus but not for 15 unactivated virus, strongly suggesting that viral replication and gene expression only 16 occurred subsequent to heat/ulipristal activation.",

In a first 2 experiment, virus vectors were administered under anesthesia to the plantar surfaces of 3 both rear feet of adult Swiss Webster outbred female mice (50,000 pfu per animal; 20 4 animals per group). Concurrently, and again 24 h later, the animals of one group 5 received an intraperitoneal injection of 0.5 mg/kg of mifepristone. Three hours after 6 inoculation, the mice of the latter group were subjected to heat treatment (43.5 0 C for 30 7 min) by immersion of their hindfeet in a temperature-controlled water bath. Twenty-two 8 days later, all animals were challenged by a 20-fold lethal dose of HSV-1 wildtype strain 9 17syn+ administered by the same route as the original virus inoculum. Survival of the 10 animals was followed until no more lethal endpoints were reached, i.e., until all surviving 11 animals had fully recovered (Fig. 2) . ICP4(-) replication-incompetent HSV-1 12 recombinant KD6 (36) induced a modest level of immunity. As had been expected, 13 because it did not replicate and also did not express the major transcriptional regulator 14 ICP4, unactivated HSV-GS3 provided a comparable degree of protection. Activated To determine whether immunization with activated HSV-GS3 reduced replication of the 22 challenge virus more effectively than unactivated HSV-GS3 or replication-defective KD6 23 virus, additional groups of animals (5 animals per group) were immunized and 1 challenged by wildtype virus as described above. Four days after challenge, the animals 2 were euthanized, feet were dissected and homogenized, and virus present in the 3 homogenates was titrated. Results revealed that activated HSV-GS3 virus reduced 4 challenge virus replication by nearly two orders of magnitude (Table 1) . Unactivated Second immunization further enhances protective immunity. We next investigated 11 whether a second activation treatment applied two days after the first treatment (i.e., at Table 2 . Results of a meta-analysis of the HSV-GS7 data 8 are presented graphically in Fig. 6 . The difference in immunization efficacy between 9 activated and unactivated HSV-GS7 was found to be highly significant. Also significant 10 was the increase in protection afforded by second immunization with an activated HSV-11 GS7 vector. The effect of second activation two days after virus administration and first 12 activation was not statistically relevant. Second activation tended to modestly enhance 13 protective immunity in a majority of experiments in which this was addressed. However, 14 in some experiments, e.g., in the experiment reported in Fig. 5A , an effect was not 15 apparent. It is noted that the conditions for second activation had not been optimized. subjected to activation treatment. Both HA RNA and protein levels appeared to be 2 somewhat higher in twice-activated animals than in once-activated animals.",

Another issue related to 7 viral gene expression in cells that were secondarily (nonproductively) infected by HSV-8 GS3. Since the ICP4 genes are regulated in the recombinant virus, little expression of 9 viral genes was expected to occur in the absence of another activating treatment.10 Abundant viral gene expression in secondarily infected cells (that may include antigen-11 presenting cells) conceivably may further enhance immune responses. Recombinant 12 HSV-GS7 in which the late VP19c gene had been subjected to regulation had been 13 constructed to examine these issues. HSV-GS3 and HSV-GS7 were compared in the 14 mouse footpad challenge model. Results revealed that activated HSV-GS3 and HSV-15 GS7 provided similar levels of protection (Fig. 4).

The finding that HSV-GS3 and HSV-GS7 induced comparable protective 6 responses suggested that viral proteins expressed in secondarily infected cells did not 7 contribute in a relevant fashion to the immune response.

In general, any of a number of DNA 13 viruses including members of all herpesvirus subfamilies may be employed for the 14 construction of replication-competent controlled vectors. We selected a fully virulent 15 HSV-1 strain as the backbone of the GS vectors for several reasons, including that HSV 16 have a double-stranded DNA genome that does not integrate in the host genome and 17 are tolerant of sizeable insertions, support stable expression of heterologous genes, 18 replicate and lyse cells efficiently as well as respond to antiviral drugs (37-40). Although 19 HSV are endemic in the human population, available data indicate that pre-existing 20 immunity is not an obstacle to vaccination/immunization uses of HSV vectors 21 (discussed in ref. 34). Furthermore, latent infection was considered a manageable issue 22 because replication of replication-competent controlled vectors can be stringently 23 controlled, and reactivation should not be capable of occurring in the two-component HSP promoter-based gene switch that is used for 3 controlling viral replication, several ligand-dependent transactivators are known that 4 may be considered for incorporation in such a gene switch. They include transactivators 5 that are derived from the bacterial tetracycline repressor or other bacterial repressors as 6 well as chimeric transactivators that exploit ligand-binding domains of various steroid 7 receptors, e.g., human progesterone, human estrogen or insect ecdysone receptors, or 8 are activated by dimerization (28). We previously constructed and analyzed two-9 component HSP promoter-based gene switches that are co-activated by antiprogestins, 10 ecdysteroid ponasterone A and rapamycin/rapalog, respectively (31,41). For regulating 11 the HSV-GS vectors, we made use of a heat-and antiprogestin-activated gene switch 12 that is strictly dependent on both heat and antiprogestin. While it has been more 13 thoroughly characterized than any other (31), this gene switch also recommends itself 14 for several other reasons. It comprises transactivator GLP65 that is activated by a 15 narrow spectrum of antiprogestins but not progestins (34). Since it only includes a 16 truncated ligand-binding domain of a progesterone receptor, GLP65 should not be 17 susceptible to ligand-independent activation; in fact, after many years of experimental 18 use, no antiprogestin-independent activation has been reported. At the low doses at 19 which they activate GLP65, antiprogestins such as mifepristone and ulipristal are not 20 expected to have any negative effects on the immune system (26). The latter 21antiprogestins also have been safety-tested in human subjects as well as are readily 22 available. They are not considered essential active ingredients by the WHO, and their 23 primary use has been in emergency contraception. To maintain maximal safety GS-type vector. Therefore, the vectors may not be employed for immunization of 4 healthy female subjects of reproductive age or younger, or the subjects may forego later 5 use of antiprogestins for emergency contraception. In contrast, the HSV-GS vectors 6 may be well suited as immunization agents or platforms in middle-aged or elderly 7 subjects.

A recent study estimated 11 that in 2012 over 3% of the adult populations of the United States and the United 12 Kingdom were immunocompromised (42). Frequencies in other upper-income countries 13 are expected to be comparable. These patients are particularly vulnerable to vaccine-14 preventable disease and would greatly benefit from effective vaccination. Owing to their 15 condition, their immune response to inactivated or subunit vaccines may be inadequate. 16 Unfortunately, use of live attenuated vaccines that may produce a more balanced and 17 more persistent immune response is problematic because of the perceived danger that 18 such vaccines may be insufficiently controlled by the weakened immune system and 19 may cause the disease they are intended to prevent. According to most relevant 20 guidelines, live attenuated vaccines are contraindicated in patients under 21 immunosuppressive therapy or HIV patients with low CD4 count (43). Hence, use of 22 currently marketed vaccines against tuberculosis (BCG), measles, mumps and rubella, 23 varicella-zoster, rotavirus, influenza (nasal) and yellow fever is universally discouraged. virus vectors expressing antigens of the latter microbes in the 4 context of efficient viral replication can be expected to elicit similarly or more potent 5 immune reactions as the contraindicated live attenuated vaccines.

Juxtaposing DISC viruses and replication-competent controlled viruses, the 15 latter viruses replicate nearly as efficiently as the wildtype virus that had been used for 16 their construction. No comparable information is available for the DISC viruses that 17 were advanced as vaccine candidates. Replication of DISC viruses is not localized but 18 occurs throughout the host. Depending on the dose of virus administered, a single 19 round of replication of disseminated virus can be expected to result in significant 20 toxicity. Not surprisingly, intracranial administration of DISC virus TA-HSV resulted in 21neurotoxicity that was only about two orders of magnitude lower than that of the 22 wildtype virus from which the strain was derived (46). Replication-competent controlled viruses should be devoid of such toxicity because they are virtually incapable of 1 replicating unless deliberately activated. It is noted that the stringency of the replication 2 block can be increased further by subjecting additional replication-essential genes to 3 gene switch control. Furthermore, even though progeny virus produced by a DISC virus 4 upon immunization is not supposed to be capable of re-infecting cells, latent infection 5 has been observed (46). Latent infection is known to involve spread from cell to cell 6 (47). Hence, as has been pointed out before (48), DISC viruses such as TA-HSV7 appear to be leaky for replication in vivo. The above properties of DISC viruses are not 8 desirable in an immunization agent or vector administered to healthy people and would 9 disqualify such viruses from use in persons with impaired immune systems. It is noted 10 that a clinical trial was conducted that investigated a DISC virus as a therapeutic 11 vaccine against recurrent genital herpes (49). Results were negative. The DISC virus 12 (TA-HSV) studied had been derived from a minimally virulent HSV-2 wildtype strain 13 (46,50). Moreover, the virus was administered at a relatively low dose, apparently to 14 avoid toxicity. Failure of the trial should not be very surprising. 15 Unlike a conventional vaccine, a replication-competent controlled vector will need to be 16 activated after administration to a subject to be immunized. Activation will need to be 17 neither costly nor inconvenient. A single ulipristal dose can be administered orally at the 18 time of immunization. Regarding heat treatment, we have developed small pads that 19 conduction-heat the inoculation region by crystallization of a supercooled salt solution 20 (51). The pads are capable of maintaining a temperature of 45 0 C for 15 min. This heat 21 dose was shown to be sufficient for strong activation in all layers of the skin of human subjects of the HSP70B promoter, which is the promoter used in the twoplasmids and viruses. Rabbit skin (RS) cells were a gift from E. Wagner and 2 were propagated in minimal essential medium Eagle's salts (MEM) (Life 3 Technologies/Thermo Fisher Scientific) supplemented with 5% heat-inactivated calf 4 serum (Atlanta Biologicals, Lawrenceville, GA), 292 mg/ml L-glutamine, 250 U/ml of 5 penicillin and 250 \u00b5g/ml of streptomycin (Life Technologies). Vero cells (procured from 6 the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and Vero-derived E5 cells (52) (obtained 7 from N.

HSV-1 strain 17syn+ and ICP4 deletion strain KD6 (36) were obtained 10 from J. Stevens. It is noted that stocks of KD6, HSV-GS3 and HSV-GS7 were 11 propagated on E5 cells. For HSV-GS3 and HSV-GS7, medium was supplemented with 12 10 nM mifepristone, and infected cultures were subjected to daily heat treatment at 13 43.5\u00b0C for 30 min for three successive days. EIV Prague/56 was a gift of T. Lengsfeld 14 and was propagated on Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells (ATCC) in DMEM 15supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated horse serum as previously described (53).16    Virus stocks of EIV were titrated using TCID50 assays in MDCK cells.

HSV-6 GS3 (Fig. 1B) was constructed as previously described (3,34). HSV-GS7 was derived 7 from intermediate vector HSV-17GS43 (34) that contains an insertion between the UL43 8 and UL44 genes of a transactivator cassette containing a GLP65 gene under the control 9 of a promoter cassette that combined a human HSP70B promoter and a GAL4-10 responsive promoter (31). To place the UL38/VP19c gene under regulation of a GAL4-11 responsive promoter, plasmid pBS-KS:GAL4-UL38 was constructed. This plasmid 12 contains a GAL4 promoter inserted in between the HSV-1 UL38 recombination arms of 13 plasmid pBS-KS:UL38\u2206promoter. A GAL4-responsive promoter comprising six copies of 14 the yeast GAL4 UAS (upstream activating sequence), the adenovirus E1b TATA 15 sequence and the synthetic intron Ivs8 was excised from plasmid pGene/v5-HisA 16 (Invitrogen, now Life Technologies) with AatII and HindIII, and the resulting 473 bp 17 fragment was gel-purified.

Plasmid pBS-KS:UL38\u2206promoter 6 was constructed by deletion of the region from -1 to -47 of the UL38 promoter, i.e., by 7 synthesizing two PCR fragments (one 437 bp and the other 550 bp) on either side of the 8 deletion and cloning these into pBS KS+. HSV-GS11 was derived from the vector HSV-9 GS3 (34) and contains an insertion between the UL37 and UL38 genes of a gene 10 cassette expressing the EIV Prague/56 HA gene driven by the CMV IE promoter. A 11 recombination plasmid was constructed by the following sequential steps. First, a 814 12 bp fragment containing the region spanning the HSV-1 UL37/UL38 intergenic region 13 from nt 83,603-84,417 from plasmid NK470 was subcloned into pBS that had had the 14 MCS removed (digestion with KpnI/SacI) to yield pBS:UL37/38. A cassette containing a 15 synthetic CMV IE promoter flanked by the pBS-SK+ MCS was ligated into pBS:UL37/38 16 digested with BspE1/AflII, which enzymes cut between the UL37 and UL38 genes, to 17 yield the plasmid pIN:UL37/38.

To facilitate efficient uptake of vector, and to minimize the amount of 8 abrasion required, the feet were saline-treated prior to infection. The following 9 procedure was employed: mice were first anesthetized with isoflurane by inhalation. 10 Flunixin meglumine (1.1 mg/kg) was then administered intramuscularly (IM) to alleviate 11 any pain associated with the procedure. Thereafter, 25-50 \u00b5l (no more than 50\u00b5l) of 12 sterile 10% saline were injected sub-epidermally under both rear footpads. The mice 13 were then returned to their cages.
