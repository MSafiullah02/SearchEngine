            "text": "Human rhinoviruses (HRV) and enteroviruses (HEV) are leading causes of infection in children. These viruses share a similar genomic organisation, but harbor significant phenotypic differences.1, 2 Infection is restricted to the respiratory tract for HRV, whereas HEV target primarily the gastrointestinal tract and, less frequently, the respiratory tract. HEV can cause viremia and secondarily seed other sites, notably the central nervous system (the first cause of meningitis) and the heart (causing mainly pericarditis).3 The diversity of HRV and HEV is not restricted to previously known serotypes and new serotypes and even new species have been identified recently (http://www.picornaviridae.com/enterovirus/enterovirus.htm). At least eight studies4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 have reported a new HRV species, HRV-C, that is phylogenetically and structurally distinct from the A and B rhinovirus groups.14 Until now, this virus has been identified only in respiratory tract specimens and, in some cases, it was associated with lower respiratory diseases of unusual severity.6, 8, 9, 13 Given its novelty, this virus can only be detected by adapted diagnostic tools. We describe the case of severe respiratory and pericardial disease in an infant infected by the new HRV-C. This suggests that the tropism of this virus in vivo is not strictly restricted to the respiratory tract.",

He had been referred to the emergency room for acute rhinitis, cough and sleep disturbance 2 weeks earlier. An acute upper and lower viral respiratory tract infection was diagnosed, but no specific therapy was introduced. Persisting fever and worsening of symptoms, including shortness of breath, led to subsequent admission. The history was remarkable for a severe hypoglycemia (1.4 mmol/l) at birth, pyelo-ureteral dilatation, a small patent ductus arteriosus, and a Sotos syndrome (slight motor developmental delay with a macrocephaly) confirmed at the genetic level. His temperature was 37.3 \u00b0C, heart and respiratory rates were 157 bpm and 50 per min, respectively, a moderate pansystolic parasternal murmur as well as grunting were audible, and orthopnea was observed. The white blood cell count was 12.8 g/l (55% neutrophils, 31% lymphocytes and 7% monocytes), C-reactive protein level was elevated at 180 mg/l (normal value <10), and procalcitonin at 2.29 \u03bcg/l (normal value <0.04). The chest radiograph revealed a cardiomegaly with a left lung infiltrate and pleural effusions, and intravenous ceftriaxone was administered. Cardiac echography revealed a circonferential 25 mm-thick, fibrinous pericardial effusion, and a tiny patent ductus arteriosus. There was no significant impairment of systolic function. All abnormalities were confirmed by a thoracic CT-scan (Fig. 1\n). A bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and surgical drainage of the pericardial effusion were performed. The pericard was fibrinous with a blood-tinged effusion within the pericardial space. His general condition improved progressively and he was discharged after 14 days. The BAL and pericardial specimens as well as blood cultures remained negative for both bacteria and mycobacteria. The pericardial biopsy showed a subacute and chronic inflammation characterized by a moderate infiltrate of mononuclear cells with superficial fibrin deposits overlaying and intermingled in an early granulation tissue. No bacteria, mycobacteria or fungi were observed on specific stains. Extensive serological work-up, including enteroviral serologies by complement fixations, did not point to any acute viral disease. Follow-up at 2 months was characterized by an excellent clinical evolution with resolution of fever and any echographic sign of pericarditis.",

Procedures were performed according to the manufacturers\u2019 instructions. RT (Superscript II, Invitrogen) was performed with random hexamers as previously described.15 Real-time PCR assays targeting HRV and HEV (\u201cPanenterhino real-time PCR\u201d16) were positive for the BAL, the pericardial fluids, and the two plasma specimens. The assay was also weakly positive on stools collected 1 week later (Table 1\n). Each specimen was extracted and analyzed at least twice. Based on cycle values, the viral load was significantly higher in the BAL fluid compared to the plasma and stools that had very low viral loads, and a slight inhibition was observed in the pericardial fluid. HEV-specific PCR15 was negative for all specimens. RT-PCR targeting other respiratory viruses (respiratory syncytial virus A and B, bocavirus, coronavirus NL63, E229, OC43 and HKU1, influenza A, B and C, human metapneumovirus, and parainfluenza virus 1, 2, 3 and 417) remained negative in the BAL specimen.

Based on 5\u2032UTR and VP1 sequences, our investigations revealed that the lower respiratory tract was infected with a rhinovirus belonging to the HRV-C species. Surprisingly, although at a low level, RNA was found in the pericardial fluid, the blood and the gastrointestinal tract. Although we cannot exclude that this RNA could be a spill over from the main respiratory site, dissemination via blood viremia is a hypothesis to consider in this case. The infection was evidenced by nucleic acid detection and, as in previous reports; we failed to isolate this new HRV-C (Table 1, Table 2\n). However, the presence of RNA in multiple different sites, confirmed in duplicated experiments, corroborates the presence of a disseminated infection. According to the virological findings and medical history, the virus possibly reached the pericardial space via a blood viremia following a respiratory tract infection, and our results suggest that the HRV-C infection contributed to the acute pericardial disease.",

As HRV is the most frequent viral respiratory infection experienced during the first year of life,22 and since HRV-C are widely circulating around the world,23 its role as a causative agent of complicated diseases requires careful study. Although frequent in HEV infections, viremia is an unusual occurrence for HRV. At least two studies24, 25 have documented rhinovirus viremia in young children or infants but, to the best of our knowledge, HRV has not been described yet in pericardial effusion. Whether HRV-C genotypes could harbor specific phenotypic abilities similar to some entero- or coxsackie viruses is suggested also by the presence of viral RNA in stools. All these observations are consistent with an \u201centero-like\u201d tropism, but we cannot rule out unusual host susceptibility. In addition, since the viral load was low in plasma and stools, we cannot exclude a RNA spill over from the respiratory tract. This possibility seems however unlikely given the number of positive sites and samples.",

The fact that we used a PCR assay with the ability to detect all HRV and HEV in the presence of a negative HEV-specific assay allowed to suspect HRV-C. The 5\u2032UTR and VP1 sequencing confirmed this hypothesis. It is therefore of importance to adapt diagnostic tools to further assess the potential ability of new picornaviruses to exhibit an unusual tropism.",
