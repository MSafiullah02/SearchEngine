Transgenic mice expressing green fluorescent protein under control of the astrocytespecific glial fibrillary acidic protein promoter were infected with a neurotropic coronavirus to facilitate phenotypic characterization of astrocytes and microglia using flow cytometry. Astrocytes in the adult central nervous system up-regulated class I surface expression, albeit delayed compared with microglia. Class II was barely detectable on astrocytes, in contrast to potent up-regulation on microglia. Maximal MHC expression in both glial cell types correlated with IFNg levels and lymphocyte accumulation. Despite a decline of IFN-g concomitant to virus clearance, MHC molecule expression on glia was sustained. These data demonstrate distinct regulation of both class I and class II expression by microglia and astrocytes in vivo following viral induced inflammation. Furthermore, prolonged MHC expression subsequent to viral clearance implies a potential for ongoing presentation.",

Restrictions on T cell surveillance are further imposed by the blood brain barrier and absence of classical lymphatic drainage (Aloisi et al., 2000; Hickey, 2001; Xiao and Link, 1998) . This quiescent state is rapidly overcome following CNS infections. During virus induced inflammation, microglia readily up-regulate both class I and class II MHC molecules in the presence of IFN-g secreted by T cells . However, in vivo detection of MHC molecules on astrocytes and oligodendrocytes during inflammation has been more difficult (Horwitz et al, 1999; Redwine et al., 2001; Stuve et al., 2002; Traugott et al., 1985) . Whereas class I expression was detected on oligodendroglia during a neuronotropic viral infection, it was not detected on astrocytes (Redwine et al., 2001) . Nevertheless, infection of cultured astrocytes with mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) induces MHC up-regulation (Gilmore et al., 1994; Lavi et al., 1989; Suzumura et al., 1986) . Furthermore, although IFN-g readily increases constitutive MHC class I expression and induces class II expression on cultured astrocytes derived from neonates (Fierz et al., 1985; Massa et al., 1993; Wong et al., 1985) , constitutive transgenic IFN-g expression was unable to induce class I or class II expression on astrocytes in vivo (Horwitz et al., 1999) . Systemic administration of IFN-g to mice also did not induce class II expression on astrocytes (Momburg et al., 1986) , whereas intracerebral injection did (Wong et al., 1984) . The recent unequivocal demonstration of class I expression on astrocytes in vivo following CNS adenoviral infection by confocal microscopy (Barcia et al., 2006) , in addition to indirect evidence for MHC restricted CD8 1 T cell function (Cabarrocas et al., 2003; Lin et al., 1997) suggests technical limits imposed by histological analysis (Lampson, 1995) may have underestimated MHC expression.",

            "text": "In contrast to the CD45 lo phenotype used to identify microglia, identification of astrocytes derived from the adult CNS has been hampered by the lack of a suitable surface marker. This study takes advantage of transgenic mice expressing the green fluorescent protein (GFP) under control of the astrocyte-specific glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) promoter (Zhuo et al., 1997) to directly analyze surface molecule expression on GFP 1 astrocytes derived from the adult inflamed CNS by flow cytometry. Encephalomyelitis was induced by infection with a neurotropic coronavirus variant designated JHMV. Infection of adult mice induces an immune-mediated primary demyelination, and has served as a model for the human demyelinating disease, multiple sclerosis . JHMV infection induces encephalitis in most strains of mice, infecting ependymal cells, microglia, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes, but rarely neurons (Wang et al., 1992) . Following a vigorous CNS inflammatory response, infectious virus is generally cleared by CD8 1 T cells within 2 weeks of infection . Control of virus infection in microglia and astrocytes is dependent on perforin-mediated cytolysis , implicating class I antigen presentation to virus-specific CD8 1 T cells. By contrast, viral clearance from oligodendrocytes appears independent of perforin-mediated cytolysis, but requires IFN-g (Bergmann et al., 2003; Parra et al., 1999) . Despite control of infectious virus by two anti-viral effector mechanisms, viral antigen and RNA persists in the absence of detectable infectious virus . Viral persistence appears to be restricted to astrocytes (Perlman and Ries, 1987) and oligodendrocytes (Lavi et al., 1984; Parra et al., 1999; Ramakrishna et al., 2003) . Loss of CD8 T cell effector function as well as poor MHC expression on glial subsets potentially contributes to the inability of T cells to control viral persistence (Ramakrishna et al., 2006) . MHC molecule expression on astrocytes was compared with microglia during viral encephalomyelitis in adult mice using flow cytometry. Astrocytes strongly up-regulated class I, albeit delayed compared with microglia. By contrast, class II remained undetectable on the majority of astrocytes, differing from the potent class II up-regulation on microglia. However, once induced, MHC molecule surface expression was maintained following virus clearance and down regulation of IFN-g. These novel data highlight the distinct abilities of microglia and astrocytes to up-regulate expression of class I and class II molecules in response to virus-induced inflammation and suggest that prolonged MHC expression may provide an opportunity for auto antigen presentation.",

All procedures were carried out in compliance with Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee approved protocols. Six-to seven-week-old mice of both sexes were injected in the left cerebral hemisphere (i.c.) with 30 lL of endotoxinfree PBS containing 500 plaque forming units (PFU) of the 2.2-v1 mAb-derived variant of JHMV (Fleming et al., 1986) . Clinical symptoms were evaluated daily based on a 0-4 scale as previously described (Fleming et al., 1986) . Briefly, mice were graded as: 0 5 healthy; 1 5 ruffled hair and hunchbacked appearance; 2 5 reduced mobility and inability to upright; 3 5 paralysis and wasting; 4 5 death. To determine virus replication within the CNS one half brains from individual mice were homogenized in 4 mL sterile phosphate buffer saline (pH 7.4) using ice cold Tenbroeck tissue homogenizers. Homogenates were centrifuged at 500g for 7 min at 4\u00b0C.

Clinical symptoms in infected FVB/N mice were observed as early as day 5 p.i., and all mice were symptomatic by day 10 p.i. (Fig. 1B) . Clinical symptoms reached a plateau between days 13 and 18 p.i. and gradually declined thereafter, with the majority of mice exhibiting essentially complete clinical recovery (Fig. 1B) .

(Fig. 3A) , declined by day 10 p.i. and persisted out to day 21 p.i. Initial infiltrates comprised mainly innate components (Fig. 3B) . Although macrophages dominated, neutrophils and NK cells were also recruited into the infected CNS. Neutrophils peaked early and rapidly disappeared by day 5 p.i., while infiltration of NK cells was maximal between days 5 and 7 p.i. and gradually decreased thereafter. As the number of total infiltrates increased, the percentage of the macrophages declined and T cells became prominent (Fig. 3C) . While total T cells constituted 3 3 10 5 and 10 3 10 5 of the infiltrates at days 5 and 7, respectively, NK cells remained relatively constant at 2.5 3 10 5 . CD4 1 T cells consistently outnumbered CD8 1 T cells by at least 2:1 throughout the course of infection. The increased ratio of CD4 1 T cells to CD8 1 T cells distinguishes the pathogenesis in FVB/N mice from both BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice, in which CD8 1 T cells prevail by day 8 p.i.

Mechanical preparation of CNS derived cells, used to characterize CD45 hi infiltrating cells and CD45 lo microglia, did not yield appreciable GFP 1 glia.

Expression levels increased further by day 5 p.i., reached maximal levels by day 7 p.i. and remained high out to 21 days p.i. Class I expression on microglia exceeded that of the majority of infiltrating cells by day 10 p.i. These data are consistent with upregulation of MHC class I expression on microglia derived from infected BALB/c mice . No MHC class I expression was detected on astrocytes derived from uninfected adult mice (Fig. 4D) . Following infection up-regulation of MHC class I on astrocytes lagged compared with microglia. Although class I expression was barely detectable by day 3 p.i., (22% class I 1 astrocytes vs. 63% microglia), it gradually increased thereafter. By day 7 p.i. nearly 100% of astrocytes expressed class I and expression was maintained through 21 days p.i., similar to microglia.",

The high level of IFN-g present at day 5 p.i. suggests that NK and T cells secreted abundant IFN-g per cell, as T cell numbers were comparable to NK cell numbers at day 5 p.i., but significantly lower than T cells at day 7 p.i. Although a contribution by NK cells cannot be ruled out, the high virus antigen load, in addition to robust MHC molecule surface expression at day 5 p.i., supports the concept that MHC molecule-TCR interactions are responsible for IFN-g release (Slifka et al., 1999; Liu and Whitton, 2005) . Similarly, the abrupt decline in IFN-g at day 10 p.i., coincident with the control of virus replication, may reflect limited TCR engagement by MHC molecules presenting viral antigen, despite sustained MHC expression. Alternatively, upregulation of inhibitory ligands may block sustained IFN-g expression (Barber et al., 2006; Suvas et al., 2006) .",

Although both MHC class I and class II molecule expression is readily induced in astrocytes cultured from neonates, MHC surface expression on astrocytes in the inflamed CNS has been difficult to confirm in adults. In the present study a neurotropic coronavirus infection was used to induce CNS inflammation in mice expressing GFP under the GFAP promoter, thus facilitating analysis of astrocytes by flow cytometry. The virus variant used replicates prominently in microglia/macrophages, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, but rarely in neurons, and induces a lymphocyte dependent sublethal demyelinating disease . Whereas MHC class I up-regulation was readily demonstrable on astrocytes following infection, class II expression was tentative at best, despite strong expression on microglia. Delayed up-regulation of MHC class I on astrocytes compared with microglia further suggested that expression by astrocytes is more constrained compared with microglia. Early class I up-regulation on microglia following virus infection is consistent with IFN-g independent induction and is likely mediated by virus induced type I interferons (Rempel et al., 2004; Zhou et al., 2005) . The apparent delay of astrocytes to up-regulate class I expression in vivo may be due to an inherent unresponsiveness to IFNa/b; however, virus infection itself and type I interferons enhance class I expression on cultured, neonatal astrocytes (Kraus et al., 1992; Massa et al., 1986) . The robust up-regulation of class I on astrocytes and both class I and class II on microglia coincident with maximal IFNg detection implicates IFN-g as a driving force for antigen presentation. T cells are the most likely source of IFN-g, as the absence of NK cells does not alter MHC molecule expression patterns following JHMV infection in C56BL/ 6 mice (Zuo et al., 2006) . The increased CNS infiltration of CD4 1 T cells, compared with CD8 1 T cells, in response to JHMV infection is unique to infected FVB/N mice and suggests that CD4 1 T cells may make a prominent contribution to IFN-g secretion in the local environment. However, neither class I or class II restricted viral epitopes have been mapped in this haplotype, preempting experimental verification.",

Interactions of class I expressing astrocytes with CD8 1 T cells in vivo are further supported by selective destruction of a subset of the astrocytes expressing a neo-autoantigen following transfer of autoantigen specific TCR transgenic CD8 1 T cells (Cabarrocas et al., 2003) and by immunological synapse formation between virally infected astrocytes and CD8 1 T cells (Barcia et al., 2006) . The inability to detect class I on astrocytes following infection with a related neurotropic JHMV variant, which infects both neurons and glial cells may reside in limitations imposed by histological analysis, although class I is detected on oligodendrocytes, microglia, and neurons (Redwine et al., 2001) . Therefore, the difference in astrocyte responsiveness may also reflect a unique cytokine milieu induced by each virus. Neurotropic coronavirus variants induce both differential kinetics and magnitude of type I and type II IFN mRNA (Parra et al., 1997; Remple et al., 2004) , which may affect class I heavy chains as well as the genes involved in antigen processing and presentation (Strehl et al., 2005) . The kinetics of class I and class II up-regulation on microglia in JHMV infected FVB/N mice used in this study are similar to those in BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice Zuo et al., 2006) suggesting different genetic backgrounds do not suffice to explain these contradictory results.",

            "text": "The apparent impairment in astrocytes to express class II molecules during acute viral encephalomyelitis, despite the presence of abundant IFN-g, is reminiscent of the inability to detect class II in this cell type by immunohistological analysis (Horwitz et al., 1999; Redwine et al., 2001) . Similarly, class II expression was essentially absent from astrocytes in EAE lesions of wt mice (Stuve et al., 2002) . CIITA is essential for class II gene transcription in astrocytes (LeibundGut-Landmann et al., 2004; Waldburger et al., 2001) . However, although transgene driven constitutive CIITA results in class II expression on astrocytes in non-inflamed CNS tissue, only a very limited number of class II expressing astrocytes are present in EAE lesions in these mice (Stuve et al., 2002) . Similarly, although class II positive astrocytes have been detected in lesions during relapsing EAE (Sakai et al., 1986) , the paucity of class II up-regulation on astrocytes compared with microglia, demonstrates in vivo cell type specific regulation. These data support that CIITA expression is selectively suppressed in astrocytes during acute inflammation, even in the presence of IFN-g. Transcriptional silencing may be due to epigenetic regulation or active suppression (Gresser et al., 2000; Landmann et al., 2001; Massa, 1993; Tooze et al., 2006) . CIITA is regulated by numerous factors including IFN-g, TGF-b, IL-1, IL-4, and IL-10 (Dong and Benveniste, 2001; Lei-bundGut-Landman et al., 2004; Rohn et al., 1996) . While ineffective IFN-g signaling by astrocytes cannot be excluded, prominent, yet delayed, class I expression suggests this pathway is intact. Furthermore, JHMV inflammation primarily constitutes a Th1-type response, as indicated by high IFN-g protein levels and low IL-4 and IL-10 gene transcription (Parra et al., 1997) negating a role for anti-inflammatory cytokines. In vitro, other mediators inhibiting class II expression on astrocytes include TGF-b, IL-1b, IFN-b, glutamate, vasoactive intestinal peptide, norepinephrine, nitric oxide, and direct contact with neurons (Dong et al., 2001 ). An interesting candidate may be IFN-b which is rapidly induced following JHMV infection (Zhou et al., 2005) , and acts downstream of CIITA transcription to block class II expression (Lu et al., 1995) .",

More stringent class I regulation by astrocytes, compared with microglia, may reside in reduced type I IFN and/or IFN-g responsiveness or additional factors known to enhance IFN-g mediated effects such as TNF-a. Although class I and class II expression correlate with IFN-g levels, maintenance of class I surface expression on astrocytes and microglia, even after clearance of infectious virus, suggest that abrogation of IFN-g secretion does not lead to immediate MHC molecule down regulation. Similarly, sustained class II expression on microglia suggests a low turnover rate of MHC molecules. Sustained MHC expression may provide an opportunity to activate autoantigen specific T cells. The expression of GFP in astrocytes enables future enrichment of this cell type for comparative gene profiling and additional insights into the regulation of antigen presentation by both distinct glial subsets and at distinct stages of inflammation.",
