The epidemic outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 has caused more than 1.7 million confirmed infections and over 100 thousand fatal cases by April 11st, 2020, affecting 210 countries. Genetically, deep sequencing of lower respiratory tract samples characterizes the virus as a distinct clade from the betacoronaviruses associated with human severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) [1, 2]. The full spectrum of COVID-19 ranges from mild, self-limiting respiratory tract illness to severe progressive pneumonia. The common clinical manifestations of COVID-19 included elevated body temperature, dry cough, dyspnea, and no obvious improvement upon three days antibiotics treatment, as well as white blood cells decreasing and pulmonary infiltrate. However, the most additional striking feature extensively observed in these patients is liver enzyme abnormality that has been reported up to 50% of patients with COVID-19 and raise great clinical concern [[3], [4], [5]], despite SARS-CoV-2 is considered as a pneumophila virus. Whether or not the cytopathy of hepatocytes elicited by SARS-CoV-2 infection causes the liver impairment remains unknown.",

In addition, no significant differences were found with regard to coexisting medical conditions, including diabetes, hypertension, digestive system disease, endocrine system disease, nervous system disease, and chronic respiratory system disease between the two groups. The prevalence of initial symptoms were also similar in both groups except that COVID-19 patients with elevated liver enzymes had a greater proportion of cough (73.4% vs. 56.5, p = 0.031). Importantly, we found that liver transaminase abnormality was associated with disease severity (p = 0.007) and higher radiology scores (p = 0.007). Specifically, 30 of 54 (55.6%) severe cases and 24 of 102 (23.5%) non-severe cases presented elevated liver enzymes. Nine severe patients, including five of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), two of sepsis, one of acute kidney injury and one of uremia were admitted to intensive care unit (ICU), among which seven (77.8%) cases presented liver enzyme abnormality. The medication details of ICU patients, as well as their liver function tests were summarized in supplementary Table 1. In our study, all of the patients received antiviral therapy with PEG-Interferon \u03b12b, Lopinavir/Ritonavir or both. Half of the patients were given antibiotic treatment and 26.3% patients were administered with systematic corticosteroids. Additionally, 26.9% patients were given immunoglobulin therapy. The treatment regimens were not significantly different between abnormal and normal transaminase groups. Of the 156 patients, the overall mortality was 2.6% (n = 4). Mortality occurred in three (4.7%) patients of liver enzymes abnormality (ARDS in two and septic shock in one) and one (1.1%) patient with normal liver enzymes (septic shock). The median duration of hospitalization was 19 days and 15 days (p = 0.127), respectively in patients with abnormal and normal liver enzymes.",

The majority of viral particles were noted to harbor completed envelope with corona-like spikes, indicating SARS-CoV-2 is not only able to entry, but also replicate in hepatocytes. Strikingly, ultrastructural features of conspicuous mitochondria swelling, endoplasmic reticulum dilatation, and impaired cell membrane demonstrated a cytopathy of SARS-CoV-2 in hepatocytes. Moreover, massive hepatic apoptosis and binuclear or a few multinuclear hepatocytes, which were syncytial, rather than proliferative identified by Ki67 IHC, were the predominant histological features of viral infection. Meanwhile, IHC results showed scanty CD4+ and CD8+ cells in liver tissues, suggesting immunopathologic insult might not be involved in liver damage.

SARS-CoV-2 is perceived to be unfavorable in liver infection due to less ACE2 expression in hepatocytes. However, we found abundant SARS-CoV-2 viral particles in hepatocytes. Usually, the receptor distribution is considered to be concordant with that of infected organs. Nevertheless, there exist notable discordances of ACE2 expression in SARS-CoV targeted multiorgans [12, 13], such as virus replication in colonic epithelium, which has no ACE2, and no virus infection in endothelial cells, which have ACE2 [14]. These discrepancies suggested the localization of ACE2 does not fully explain the liver tropism of SARS-CoV-2. We speculated alternative extra-ACE2 receptors or co-receptors might exist. Another possibility is that the expression of ACE2 in hepatocytes may be up-regulated upon sensing virus entry. We however have no data on the expression of ACE2 in SARS-CoV-2 infected liver and further study is required to address this hypothesis.",

Mechanistically, proinflammatory cytokines were reported to increase significantly in severe COVID-19 cases [4, 15]. This event often provokes systemic ischemia and hypoxia blamed for inadequate pulmonary ventilation, which manifested in elevation of A-aDO2. Thus severe COVID-19 patients may predispose to develop hypoxic-ischemic liver injury. The hallmark of ischemic liver injury is centrilobular necrosis and usually identified by acute and marked increase of serum transaminase [16, 17]. The two biopsied cases in the current study however did not present the pathological feature of ischemic liver and their serum transaminases were increased moderately, implicating the liver impairment in these two cases might be independent of pulmonary dysfunction to extent. Additionally, other COVID-19 related complications could not be ruled out involved in liver enzyme abnormality, such as sepsis. There were only two septic patients in our study, one with elevated liver enzyme (case 2) and one being of normal liver enzyme, implicating sepsis is unlikely a factor that contribute to the high rate of liver enzyme abnormality in the current cohort. Additionally, the pathological examination in case 2 showed no septic pathological features of centrilobular necrosis, canalicular/ductular cholestasis, non-bacterial cholangitis, suggesting sepsis insult is unlikely a main cause of liver impairment in this case. Nevertheless, due to the limited septic patients in our cohort, we could not provide convincing data on the frequency of liver function abnormality in septic patients.",

The median GGT values in both groups of abnormal and normal transaminase were in normal rangeand no significant differences in levels of direct bilirubin (DBiL), total bilirubin (TBiL), or alkaline phosphatase (ALP) were observed between two groups, suggesting bile ducts were unlikely the SARS-CoV-2 target sites. Notably, patients with elevated liver enzymes were more frequent to have lower serum albumin, suggesting an association of liver synthetic dysfunction and liver enzyme abnormality in COVID-19 patients. Serum FER level was higher in patients with elevated transaminase. Physiologically, one third FER was stored in liver and the circulating FER is normally able to be cleared by the liver cells. Therefore patients with damaged liver may fail to get rid of circulating FER, leading to an accumulated FER in serum. Immune disruption, characterized by lymphopenia, decreased levels of CD4+ T cells and B lymphocytes, was more profoundly in transaminases elevated cases. However, the serum IL-6 was not higher, but even lower in patients with abnormal transaminase. Besides, both lymphopenia and elevated liver enzymes were linked to severity of COVID-19. We thereafter assumed that the immune dysfunction and liver impairment were coincident events, rather than cause-effect relationship.",

Due to barely accessible autopsy or biopsy, we have only two biopsied cases for ultrastructural and pathological analysis, which were unable to represent the entire cohort. Moreover, the cohort is not larger enough and limited to two centers. Therefore, large- and multi-cohort studies that contain more cases available for biopsy or autopsy were justified to comprehensively understand liver impairment in COVID-19 patients. However, we believe that our remarkable findings offered crucial clue to liver enzyme abnormality in COVID-19 patients.",
