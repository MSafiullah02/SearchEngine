Robot assisted surgery (RAS) may help to reduce hospital stay for patients that urgently need complex-oncological-surgery, thus making room for COVID-19 patients. In comparison to open or conventional laparoscopic surgery, RAS potentially reduces not only contamination with body fluids and surgical gasses of the surgical area but also the number of directly exposed medical staff. A prerequisite is that general surgical precautions under COVID-19 circumstances must be taken, with the addition of prevention of gas leakage:",

At first British Intercollegiate General Surgery Guidance on COVID-19 specifically recommended that 'laparoscopy should generally not be used' because of aerosol contamination with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which has been rephrased to 'consider laparoscopy only in selected individual cases' the following day [14] . Publications cited state that there are no data or actually question whether there would be contamination [11, 15] . These latter and other recommendations therefore just advise to carefully consider whether we should use or avoid laparoscopic surgery [9, 10] . As a matter of fact, laparoscopy might even protect against viral exposure through smoke, provided that CO 2 and smoke are filtered and extracted, preferably using an integrated flow system with a continuous smoke evacuation through an Ultra Low Penetrating Air (ULPA) filter meeting the Association of periOperative Registered Nurses guidelines [8, 16] . As ultrasonic sealing devices produce large amounts of smoke containing non-deactivated viral particles their use should be avoided [17] .",

For this reason, the Food and Drug Administration has advised that a negative result should 'not be used as the sole basis for .... patient management decisions' [20] .

Do not open the tap of any ports unless they are attached to a CO 2 filter or being used to deliver the gas. \u2022 Minimize introduction and removal of instruments through the ports as much as possible. For introduction of material (such as bags, meshes) or specimen retrieval (such as biopsies), deflate the abdomen with a suction device before entering or removing the material into or from the abdomen or use an air-lock system. Re-insert the port before turning CO 2 on again. \u2022 At the end of the procedure turn CO 2 off, deflate the abdomen with a suction device and via the port with CO 2 filter, before removal of the ports. \u2022 Avoid the use of ultrasonic sealing and use lowest possible electrocautery power.
