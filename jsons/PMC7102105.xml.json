Aeromonads are essentially ubiquitous in the microbial biosphere and they can be isolated from virtually every environmental niche where bacterial ecosystems exist, such as aquatic habitats, fish, foods, domesticated pets, birds, and natural soils [1\u20133]. The first classifications within the Aeromonas genus have been determined phenotypically (phenospecies), based on growth characteristics and biochemical tests. Nevertheless, there is great difficulty in identifying the different Aeromonas strains on the species level by these characteristics, due to the phenotypical heterogenicity and growing number of known species. One of the biggest steps forward in the taxonomic process has been the introduction and continuous use of genotypical methods (genospecies) [3\u20136]. With the use of molecular methods, 96% of the clinical isolates are represented by four species: A. caviae (29.9%), A. dhakensis (25.5%), A. veronii (22.0%), and A. hydrophila (18.0%) [7].",

Other reported infections include pneumonia, liver abscesses, peritonitis, meningitis, endocarditis, urinary tract infections, otitis media, eye infections, and osteomyelitis. Infections occur mainly in immunosuppressed hosts (basically patients with cirrhosis, diabetes, or malignancy), but they may also develop in healthy individuals [3]. The role of Aeromonas species in some syndromes, such as bacterial gastroenteritis, is still speculative and the subject of much debate [3, 8, 11]. However, recently, the enteropathogenic role of Aeromonas has been re-evaluated and demonstrated [12].",

In our series, 80% of patients had at least one underlying disease, with malignancy and chronic disease being the most common. Interestingly, 22% of patients in our study were previously healthy. In our cohort, gastroenteritis was the most prevalent infection. In several reported studies throughout the world, Aeromonas spp. has been isolated at a rate of 0.6\u201310% from patients with diarrhea, predominantly from infants and children [3, 7, 8, 11, 18]. In Spain, Aeromonas occupied the fourth place among microbiological causes of all gastrointestinal diseases reported each year during the period from 1997 to 2006 [19]. The high incidence of Aeromonas spp. gastroenteritis in our series of adult patients is not in agreement with data from France and countries of south-east Asia, which reported that Aeromonas-associated diarrhea was the third clinical form of presentation, with 19 and 15%, respectively [9, 20, 21]. This variation may be due to the geographical difference in that south-east of Asia is endemic for Aeromonas, but also other factors may explain these differences, such as dietetic habits, processing method adopted for isolation and identification of Aeromonas species, and the ecology of this microorganism [3, 4, 20, 22].",

            "text": "The role of Aeromonas as a gastrointestinal pathogen has been controversial, as 1\u20134% of asymptomatic individuals carry Aeromonas spp. in their gut [3, 4, 18]. Enterotoxins, cytotoxins, and hemolysins have been studied to elucidate a mechanism by which Aeromonas spp. produce diarrhea, but no convincing causal relationship has been established so far [23]. It is generally assumed that the virulence of Aeromonas is multifactorial and that only a subset of Aeromonas strains can cause gastroenteritis in humans. Moreover, the intestine is a complex ecosystem and in this complex \u201chost-enteric pathogen ecosystem,\u201d a variety of both direct and indirect interactions between enteric pathogens, their host, and the circumstances must be taken into account [12, 24, 25]. In the present series, up to 80% of patients with Aeromonas gastroenteritis suffered from severe comorbidities. Therefore, Aeromonas gastrointestinal tract involvement appears to develop in patients predisposed to bowel infection either due to local immune deficiency or by nutritional factors. Unfortunately, we did not explore the pathogenicity and infectivity at a genetic level to establish the role of Aeromonas as an important enteropathogen. The prevalence of coinfection in our series was 14.4% in patients with gastroenteritis, with C. difficile followed by protozoa as the most common pathogens. Thus, it is difficult, in mixed infections, to assess the true contribution of Aeromonas to disease. Bloodstream invasion in patients with gastroenteritis is extremely uncommon and occurs preceding or concurrent with the onset of bacteremia in 9\u201314% of cases [26]. In our series, no case was recorded, while five patients developed bacteremia in the course of gastroenteritis by other enteropathogens yielded in the same fecal sample. It is possible that Aeromonas requires a huge inoculum into the lumen of the gastrointestinal tract to spread to the bloodstream. The association of Aeromonas with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is of particular interest [10]. All of the patients with an autoimmune disorder (most of them with IBD) developed acute gastroenteritis as the clinical presentation of infection by Aeromonas. It is well known that Aeromonas has a variety of implications in patients with IBD, as a trigger of the IBD onset or of a relapse, or Aeromonas can cause gastroenteritis without any effect on the IBD course [10]. Remarkable findings among patients with Aeromonas-associated gastroenteritis in our cohort were that 72.5% had been hospitalized and 26.9% of patients received immunosuppressant drugs. In half of the patients with gastroenteritis, the infection was nosocomial. It\u2019s possible that Aeromonas-associated diarrhea appeared as a consequence of proliferation and mucosal invasion of patients previously colonized, under aggressive therapies, and with certain comorbidity conditions.",

In our series, pneumonia was related to aspiration of vomitus in patients with Aeromonas colonizing their gut [38].

These epidemiological differences could be a consequence of variations in the ecology of Aeromonas and with differences in the fecal carriage rate of Aeromonas spp. in certain parts of south-east Asia that can be as high as 30%, whereas it is only 3% in Europe [42]. One-third of our cases, however, were healthy, and, among these, there was a predominance of very elderly patients. It has been suggested that contaminated lines, such as catheters, can also serve as a portal of entry to seed blood-borne infection [41].

Most of the isolates were not susceptible to ampicillin or co-amoxiclav, in agreement with what should be expected because this is a phenotypic characteristic of the genus Aeromonas, where only one species, A. trota, shows susceptibility and occasionally some other strains [43, 45]. More than 90% of the Aeromonas isolates demonstrated a high level of susceptibility to third- or fourth-generation cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, aztreonam, and tigecycline, indicating that these antibiotics would be the first choice for the empiric treatment of infections by Aeromonas. A quarter of strains were found to be resistant to imipenem, ciprofloxacin, and piperacillin + tazobactam, antibiotics widely used in the treatment of severe infections by Gram-negative bacteria. Multidrug-resistant isolates of Aeromonas spp. are of major concern. Recently, a study of different human and environmental sources indicated that Aeromonas is developing a high level of resistance to aminoglycosides, carbapenems, and third-generation cephalosporins [46].",

All of the patients with pneumonia died during hospitalization despite having been treated with appropriate antibiotics and 50% patients were admitted to the ICU. The high mortality may be a consequence of the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). A case of ARDS related to Aeromonas pneumonia successfully treated with antibiotics and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been recently reported [48]. Although about 30% of patients with Aeromonas peritonitis required treatment in the ICU, the in-hospital mortality for this condition was 20%. This relatively favorable outcome may be due to the fact that most of the patients received immediate drainage in addition to appropriate antibiotic therapy. The low mortality among patients with wound and skin and soft tissue infections was due to the absence of cases with fulminant cellulitis and necrotizing fasciitis [14, 49].",

Age older than 80 years, ICU admission, and neoplastic disease were independent risk factors predicting unfavorable outcomes in patients with Aeromonas infection. Half of the patients over 80 years old died during the follow-up period after the isolation of Aeromonas due to conditions that were non-related to infection. Contaminated food is one of the transmission routes of Aeromonas spp. and the elderly are particularly susceptible to foodborne illness compared with healthy adults, many of whom are affected by chronic illness or advanced cancer [50].",

Firstly, all the isolates were obtained from a medical center and, therefore, the interpretation of our results may not be generalized to other areas. Secondly, this is a retrospective work based on phenotypic methods, which are less accurate than genotypic methods for precise Aeromonas identification. During the study period, there have been several shifts in the taxonomy of the genus Aeromonas, in particular, the A. hydrophila subspecies dhakensis [51, 52]. Nowadays, only molecular characterization using the sequences of housekeeping genes like rpoD or gyrB enable the proper identification of the Aeromonas spp. Another limitation is that the pathogenicity of Aeromonas in some cases might be debated because analyses of toxin production were not performed. Nevertheless, the main strength of this study is that the cohort was generated from the database of a large teaching referral center in a defined time period. Our study highlights that the isolation of Aeromonas spp. from clinical samples in humans is a marker of poor prognosis among those patients aged >80 years, with severe underlying disease, in particular with advanced malignancy, and acute illness requiring ICU admission.",
