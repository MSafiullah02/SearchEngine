They planned to recruit 120 patients, but the study was suspended after recruitment of the first 13 patients, owing to an excess incidence of acute cellular rejection in the rituximab group.

All the episodes of rejection responded to intravenous methylprednisolone, and allograft function was similar in the two groups at 12 months. After rituximab treatment, peripheral B cells were undetectable in all patients. Serum cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor \u03b1, interleukin-6, and interleukin-10, were increased after transplantation, as compared with baseline values.",

One week prior to the fourth cycle he developed type 1 respiratory failure. On day seven post fourth cycle R-CHOP, he developed neutropenic sepsis with neutropenia. On day 14 he complained of difficulty in breathing especially on talking and exertion. Chest showed bilateral opacities. Initial bronchoalveolar lavage were negative. Therefore the most likely cause for the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was rituximab-induced lung disease. And he later succumbed in the intensive care unit. This patient fits into the subacute onset group, which is known to be the commonest form, usually occurring around the fourth cycle of rituximab.

After 15 min of starting of IV infusion of rituximab, he started having severe retrosternal chest pain, diagnosed as acute ST elevation from inferior wall MI. Patient was preloaded with dual anti-platelets. Coronary angiogram showed 100% occlusion of proximal RCA. Thrombosuction of this culprit right coronary artery revealed underlying 90% stenosis. After that, balloon angioplasty of RCA was done. The procedure was terminated in the view of successful balloon angioplasty with good flow. He was kept on dual antiplatelet therapy for 1 month with regular platelet monitoring. With the growing increasing global use of rituximab for various oncological and immunological diseases, this complication of myocardial infarction should be kept in mind. They recommend that patients with known cardiovascular risk factors should be assessed for ischemic heart disease before treatment and be carefully monitored during and after treatment especially during first infusion when tumor burden is highest with a slow initial infusion rate, followed by increasing the rate in 30-min increments as tolerated. This life-threatening cardiovascular complication should also be kept in mind while using rituximab in patients without cardiovascular risk factors. The mechanism by which rituximab elicits infusion reactions remains unclear, although the symptoms associated with the reactions are thought to be related to the release of inflammatory cytokines. The incidence of infusion reactions was highest during the first infusion (77%) and decreased with each subsequent infusion. Adverse events can include urticaria, hypotension, angioedema, hypoxia, pulmonary infiltrates, acute respiratory distress syndrome, myocardial infarction, ventricular fibrillation, or cardiogenic shock. The majority of severe reactions occur approximately 30\u2013120 min after starting the first infusion.",

The next day, his platelet count abruptly dropped from 85,000 to 5,000/\u03bcL, which spontaneously recovered in a few days without specific treatment. They speculate that the occurrence of infusion-related cytokine release syndrome in rituximab-sensitive high tumor burden follicular lymphoma contributed to the development of RIAT. The patient is scheduled to receive cyclophosphamide (CHOP) chemotherapy (750 mg/m2 cyclophosphamide, 50 mg/m2 doxorubicin and 1.4 mg/m2 vincristine on day 1, and 1 mg/kg prednisolone on days 1\u20135) followed by rituximab. On day 19 of CHOP chemotherapy, the patient received rituximab 375 mg/m2 intravenously over 4 h. Within 2 h, he developed infusion-related hypersensitivity reactions consisting of a fever, chill, and nausea, which were resolved by 125 mg methylprednisolone. The next day (day 20), his platelet count abruptly dropped to 5,000/\u03bcL, which was verified on a peripheral smear and repeat complete blood count. The WBC also dropped to 2,200/\u03bcL.",

They observed a rapid but transient induction of circulating IgG + B cells and an increased number of proliferating B cells in the lymph nodes after 1 month of treatment. Notably, bortezomib treatment induced germinal center B cell and follicular helper T cell expansion in the lymph nodes. These data suggest that bortezomib-induced plasma cell depletion triggers humoral compensation. On the basis of the effect of bortezomib on PC and in vivo compensation, they suggest that bortezomib should not be used alone for desensitization, because bortezomib depletion of PCs will lead to a compensatory response, which is likely to be deleterious to an allograft. They suggest that desensitization regimens incorporating the unique effect of bortezomib should be designed on the basis of its mechanistic effects and limitations and that adjuvant B cell depletion, blocking of GC initiation, or strategies to prevent GC compensation should be considered.",
