            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a form of atypical pneumonia first identified in late 2002. The disease was found to be caused by a novel human coronavirus named SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in early 2003 (Drosten et al., 2003, Ksiazek et al., 2003, Peiris et al., 2003). Coronaviruses are enveloped, positive-stranded RNA viruses containing the largest viral RNA genomes known to date (27\u201331 kb). These RNA coronaviruses release their genetic information into the cytoplasm of the cell. The 5\u2032-two thirds of the SARS-CoV genomic RNA contains two open reading frames (ORFs), termed ORF1a and ORF1b. These ORFs are translated via a ribosomal frameshift mechanism (Thiel et al., 2003) to generate the viral replicase polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab that mediate the functions required for viral replication and transcription (Marra et al., 2003, Rota et al., 2003). These polyproteins are extensively processed by viral proteases to generate 16 nonstructural proteins (nsps) (Fig. 1\n) that assemble with host intracellular membranes to form double membrane vesicles (DMVs), the site of viral RNA synthesis (Goldsmith et al., 2004, Gosert et al., 2002, Snijder et al., 2006).",

Both proteases are processed autocatalytically from the replicase polyprotein sequence, and PLpro is responsible for cleaving 3 sites whereas 3CLpro is responsible for cleaving 11 sites within the viral genome (Harcourt et al., 2004, Thiel et al., 2003).

This is most likely due to the facts that; (1) the closely related 3C-like proteinase from the human rhinovirus has been successfully targeted by antiviral agents for treatment of the common cold (Matthews et al., 1999); (2) there are a number of X-ray structures available for the 3C-like proteases from SARS-CoV, rhinoviruses, HCoV-229E, and transmissible gastro enteritis virus (TGEV) making structure-based drug design feasible (Anand et al., 2002, Anand et al., 2003, Ghosh et al., 2005, Hilgenfeld et al., 2006, Matthews et al., 1999); and (3) the SARS-CoV 3CLpro enzyme can be purified in large quantities, is highly active and easily assayed, and is readily crystallized making in vitro studies very straightforward. In contrast, the SARS-CoV PLpro enzyme is membrane associated making it significantly more challenging to study in vitro. Recently, a soluble form of SARS-CoV PLpro has been overexpressed, purifed and characterized (Barretto et al., 2005, Barretto et al., 2006), and its\u2019 X-ray structure has been determined by our group (Ratia et al., 2006).",

The discovery and development of antiviral compounds is, in general, coupled to an in vitro enzymatic assay that can be performed in a laboratory setting. Frequently, as is the case for 3CLpro, these assays are based on hydrolysis of a small synthetic peptide which can be monitored by either HPLC analysis, or by monitoring the release of a chromaphore or fluorescent reporter group upon cleavage. For SARS-CoV 3CLpro, there have been a number of studies that have each utilized different peptide substrates, as well as different reporter groups including chromaphores, fluorescence groups, and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) pairs (Table 1\n). All three reporters have distinct advantages over HPLC detection since they are typically more sensitive and offer a methodology for continuous monitoring of proteolytic activity over time.",

Moreover, these studies have each utilized a variety of assay conditions and different SARS-CoV 3CLpro constructs that do not necessarily reflect the authentic sequences in vivo. Evidence is mounting that the kinetic properties of 3CLpro are significantly influenced by the construct and assay conditions utilized (Table 2\n). Tied to this knowledge is the observation that SARS-CoV 3CLpro is only functional as a dimer in solution (Chen et al., 2005a, Fan et al., 2004, Shi et al., 2004). Therefore, it is important to understand these differences and to develop a set of standardized assay conditions containing components appropriate for comparing differences in kinetic properties and parameters, e.g. IC50 and Ki values, between different compounds aimed at serving as therapeutic leads. In the occurrence of drug design, it becomes particularly vital to standardize an approach that can be used by the scientific community for reliable comparison of different or even the same compounds between research groups.",

Two of the FRET reporter groups, Dabcyl-EDANS and Abz-Tyr(N02), were chosen because they are readily synthesized commercially, and they are commonly used for the measurement of protease activity. For SARS-CoV 3CLpro, Dabcyl-EDANS has been the most popular reporter system (Chen et al., 2005a, Chen et al., 2005b, Chen et al., 2005c, Wu et al., 2004, Wu et al., 2006) (Table 1). Other groups have utilized Abz or MCA fluorophores with the corresponding nitrotyrosine or Dnp quenchers (Kaeppler et al., 2005, Kuang et al., 2005, Lee et al., 2005, Yang et al., 2005) in addition to colorimetric labels (Liu et al., 2005b) (Table 1). Although these FRET-pairs have an established history, there are a number of newer fluorophores on the market that have higher quantum yields, pH independent fluorescence, and absorbance spectra in the visible region (e.g. >450 nm) making them potentially useful for high-throughput screening and ultra-sensitive fluorescence measurements. One series of fluorophores are the AlexaFluor dyes (Molecular Probes & Invitrogen).",

The FEC value of 37,840 for the Alexa488-QSY7 FRET pair was significantly larger than the FEC values of the other three substrates tested. The FEC value relates the amount of fluorescence produced from the cleavage of a known concentration of substrate and is analogous to the molar extinction coefficient used in absorbance spectroscopy. The FEC value allows the investigator to judge the sensitivity of the assay and calculate the concentration of product produced per unit time. The larger the FEC value, the more sensitive the probe. Thus, the AlexaFluor488-QSY7 FRET peptide is approximately 8\u201310 times brighter than the Alexa594-QSY21 and Dabcyl-EDANS substrates, and almost 40 times more fluorescent than the Abz-Thr(NO2) substrate.",

            "text": "A disadvantage of highly fluorescence FRET-substrates such as Alexa-QSY and Dabcyl-Edans, is that they are susceptible to a phenomenon known as the \u201cinner-filter effect\u201d. This effect results when the fluoresced light is absorbed by quenching groups on neighboring substrates or cleaved product molecules so that only a fraction of the fluoresced light impinges upon the detector system of the fluorimeter (Liu et al., 1999). The result of the inner-filter effect is that if uncorrected, incorrect or artificial kinetic parameters, i.e. K\nm and k\ncat are determined. Liu and co-workers have demonstrated that this is a common problem with Dabcyl-EDANS FRET-substrates and depends on the wavelength range, pathlength, and concentration of quenching components (Liu et al., 1999). A survey of the literature on the influence of the inner-filter effect on SARS-CoV 3CLpro assays utilizing Dabcyl-EDANS and Abz-Tyr(NO2) substrates produced a small number of studies that observed and corrected for the inner-filter effect (Blanchard et al., 2004, Kaeppler et al., 2005, Lee et al., 2005), and a larger number of studies that did not account for this effect or report it (Bacha et al., 2004, Chou et al., 2004, Kao et al., 2004, Kuo et al., 2004, Liu et al., 2005a). When the inner-filter effect is corrected, the K\nm values of FRET-peptide substrates range from 190 to 2 mM depending on the peptide sequence, with the majority of K\nm values greater than 500 \u03bcM (Blanchard et al., 2004, Fan et al., 2004, Kaeppler et al., 2005, Lee et al., 2005). These values are commensurate with the K\nm values derived from HPLC assays. In contrast, the K\nm values derived uncorrected data are typically in the 10\u201350 \u03bcM range (Bacha et al., 2004, Chou et al., 2004, Kao et al., 2004, Kuo et al., 2004, Liu et al., 2005a). What is most revealing in a number of these studies is that the uncorrected FRET-peptide substrate K\nm data are different than the HPLC derived kinetic data. Kao and co-workers show a plot of uncorrected rate data versus Dabcyl-EDANS, FRET-substrate concentration with apparent substrate inhibition noticeable at 40 \u03bcM (Kao et al., 2004) which is exactly what is observed for uncorrected data (Liu et al., 1999). We observed and corrected for the inner-filter effect with all four substrates tested.",

This curvature indicates that dimer-to-monomer dissociation may be occurring. A number of studies have demonstrated that SARS-CoV 3CLpro functions as a dimer (Chen et al., 2005a, Fan et al., 2004, Shi et al., 2004). We have compiled a list of different dimer-to-monomer dissociation constants in conjunction with the various constructs and methods used to measure the oligomeric state in Table 2. We fit our data in Fig. 5 to Eq. (1) which describes dimer-to-monomer dissociation where only the dimer is active (Chen et al., 2006, Kuo et al., 2004). From a fit of our data to Eq. (1), we obtain dissociation constants between 0.25 and 1 \u03bcM considering the error in the fits. Our values are commensurate with the enzymatic-derived values of Chen and coworkers for an uncleaved, c-(His)6-tagged construct (Chen et al., 2006, Kuo et al., 2004), lower than the values of Fan and coworkers for an uncleaved, c-(His)6-tagged construct (Fan et al., 2004), and higher than the values obtained by Kuo and coworkers for a cleaved n-(His)6-tagged construct (Kuo et al., 2004). In general, our values are consistently and significantly lower than the dissociation constants for the tagged-constructs that were determined by any of the biophysical methods (Table 2).",

Although investigators have claimed the use of (His)6-tags have no effect on enzymatic or quaternary structure (Bacha et al., 2004, Chou et al., 2004), it is clear that in our experiments, N-terminal tags have a significant effect on kinetic parameters (Fig. 5). The influence of N- and C-terminal activity can be explained partially by the nature of dimerization of the enzyme structure. The interactions of the N- and C-terminal ends of monomers of SARS-CoV 3CLpro near the active site are shown in Fig. 6\n. This figure was generated from the X-ray crystal structure of the Cys145Ala mutant of SARS-CoV 3CLpro (PDB 1Z1J: (Hsu et al., 2005)) that has small N- and C-terminal extensions. In this structure, the C terminus of a protomer from another asymmetric unit is intercalated into the active site of the 3CLpro dimer. The C-terminal peptide containing a glutamine residue occupies the P1 pocket of the enzyme. The N-terminal peptide from the other monomer of the dimer is modeled in yellow and contains the serine residue in the P1\u2032 pocket of the enzyme. This is representative of the autoprocessing cleavage reaction that occurs in vivo. Note that the ends of the molecules extend directly into the active site. Thus, the introduction of tags on the N- or C-termini, will likely influence the quaternary structure and hence enzymatic properties of the enzyme. In strong support of our observations, Xue and coworkers reported recently that the addition of two residues (Gly-Ser) or five residues (Gly-Pro-Leu-Gly-Ser-) to the N-terminus of SARS-CoV 3CLpro reduced its catalytic efficiency (K\ncat/K\nm) by 20-fold and 150-fold, respectively (Xue et al., 2007).",

We were unable to crystallize the apoenzyme or covalently modified enzyme from over 1000 crystallization conditions attempted. In contrast, we can readily crystallize the covalently labeled native enzyme within 4 h (Fig. 3), and the apoenzyme within a couple of days. The negative influence of the N-terminal extension on crystallization also supports the kinetic and other biophysical data suggesting a profound influence of N- and C-terminal extensions on the properties of SARS-CoV 3CLpro. Therefore, our experimental observations, coupled with the vast amount of literature now available on the quaternary structure of SARS-CoV 3CLpro, leads us to conclude that native constructs are much preferred over uncleaved, tagged constructs for analysis of 3CLpro enzymatic activity and structure.",

We demonstrate for the first time that AlexaFluor dyes and QSY quencher pairs have great potential for use in protease assays. We have shown that N- and C-terminal extensions (tags) to the SARS-CoV 3CLpro enzyme have a significant effect on the activity and quaternary structure of the enzyme. We subjected the enzyme to alterations in salt and organics, while keeping pH constant, and in parallel with other groups we do see alterations in activity in response to added NaCl.",

            "text": "We recommend establishing a standardized assay for examining the activity and structure of SARS-CoV 3CLpro. Although such studies are performed outside the cellular environment and will inherently be artificial, the in vitro assays performed need to be done in a consistent fashion among researchers in order to evaluate results, especially with inhibitors, between groups. We therefore recommend that expression constructs and protocols that produce pure 3CLpro with the authentic N- and C-termini which would be generated from the polyprotein in vivo, be used in kinetic and structural studies of the enzyme. Alternatively, a construct, just as the one used in these studies, that generates 3CLpro with an n-terminal methionine can be used. Any other amino acid additions to SARS-CoV 3CLpro, especially to the N-terminus, are likely to produce significant deviations in kinetic parameters for substrates and inhibitors. We recommend using a pH of 7.5 for optimal enzyme activity, the addition of no more than 100 mM NaCl to the assay buffer, and careful consideration as to the use of reducing agents since they can have a profound effect on certain classes of inhibitors. Reducing agents should be added to the enzyme storage buffer to keep the enzyme active. Small amounts or reducing agents are well tolerated in assays. DMSO can be added up to 10%, and EDTA may be added up to 1 mM to scavenge spurious heavy-metal ions. Use of 0.01\u20130.1 mg/ml BSA should be considered when using lower enzyme concentrations in order to help eliminate nonspecific binding of the enzyme to solid surfaces such as the wells in 96-well plates.",
