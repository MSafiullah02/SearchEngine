We report a patient who had had no direct contact with SARS patients and who subsequently transmitted the infection to her intensivist who was wearing standard PPE during a bronchoscopy.",

She had had no direct contact with any patients suffering from SARS, but had visited a friend with hepatitis in hospital who was at least two cubicles (approximately 10 m) away from a patient later confirmed to have SARS. On examination, she was tachypnoiec and febrile. Chest radiography revealed bilateral basal consolidations and the white blood cell count was 19.3\u00d7109/L (polymorphs 90%, lymphocytes 4%). Community-acquired pneumonia was diagnosed and the patient was isolated in a single room with negative pressure and started on intravenous antibiotics. The following day, she required endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation. Over the next four days, she developed multi-system organ failure and adult respiratory distress syndrome requiring haemofiltration and vasopressor support and died on the eighth day of admission. Cultures of blood, urine and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) were negative for micro-organisms including fungi and mycobacteria.",

To our knowledge, fomite spread has not been well documented for SARS, although it has been demonstrated experimentally for other respiratory viral pathogens, and is the probable route of transmission for our patient. Environmental contamination is the most likely route of transmission in Hotel M, which triggered off the worldwide outbreak of SARS1 and in the large Amoy Gardens outbreak.4 Transmission to a bronchoscopist has not, to our knowledge, been documented before. During the procedure the doctor wore an N95 mask, glasses, gloves, footwear and disposable gown. However, he was not using specific eye protection and a powered air purifying respirator (PAPR) hood, which has become common practice since then.",

This is similar to the experience in Canada in which transmission of SARS to protected healthcare workers occurred during a difficult intubation.5 We believe that high-risk procedures such as intubation or bronchoscopy may require a higher level of protection than N95 respirators. We also feel that more work needs to be done to establish the role of environmental surfaces in the indirect transmission of the virus to individuals without direct contact. These will be important for future strategies for SARS.",
