            "text": "NK cells are large granular lymphocytes that are a component of the innate immune system. NK cells kill target cells spontaneously without the requirement of priming or the expression of major histocompatibility antigens (MHC) on the target cell. NK cells lack the receptor diversity generated by DNA rearrangement found in prototype members of the adaptive immune response, T and B cells. However, similar to T cells, NK cells are able to distinguish healthy cells from virally infected cells. NK cells produce abundant antiviral cytokines, release cytotoxic granules such as granzyme B and trigger the FAS/TRAIL pathway to induce apoptosis of infected cells [35]. In order to mount a response, NK cells have to integrate signals received from many inhibitory and activating receptors to sense the environment and respond. Regulation of NK cell activity is achieved by a balance between these inhibitory and activating signals although signals received by inhibitory receptors tend to be dominant [21]. Many of the initial insights on NK cell function came from studying chronic viral infections in mice such as LCMV and MCMV [7]. The clearest demonstration that NK cells are important to humans stem from the findings that patients with NK cell deficiencies develop severe, recurrent viral infections [6, 54]. Our knowledge of select receptors on human NK cells modulated by viral infection and viral peptides that can modulate NK cell function has significantly advanced in the last decade in the context of human viral infections such as HMCV, HIV and HCV [7, 19]. Some of the findings seen in these human chronic viral infections are beginning to be observed for viral infections such as Influenza and Dengue thus opening up new areas of research that will enhance our understanding of how these innate effector cells can control acute viral infections [1, 4, 57, 58, 72]",

            "text": "Human NK cells were shown to lyse dengue virus (DENV)-infected cells to a greater degree compared to uninfected cells over 30 years ago [38]. Antibodies to DENV further augmented the lysis of DENV-infected cells by NK cells. The traditional phenotype used to define human NK cells is based on the absence of CD3 (to exclude T cells) and relative expression of CD56 (neural cell adhesion molecule) and CD16 (low-affinity receptor for the Fc portion of immunoglobulin G). It is now appreciated that CD56 \u201cbright\u201d cells can produce cytokines abundantly but are poorly cytolytic while CD56 \u201cdim\u201d cells (which represent 90% of circulating NK cells) produce moderate cytokines when stimulated but are strongly cytolytic [60]. Using PBMC samples obtained from children in Thailand undergoing severe dengue infection nearly 20 years ago, Green et al. observed increased frequencies of activated NK cells (CD56+ CD69+ cells) in PBMC from patients with severe dengue disease compared to patients with milder disease suggesting that that NK cells are actively involved in the defense against dengue virus [26]. Homchampa et al. found evidence of NK cell cytotoxicity in fresh cells from children with acute dengue and the level of cytotoxicity was related to disease severity [31]. At the time, many of the activating and inhibitory receptors present on NK cells were not identified and the technologies to assess markers on individual NK cells using multiparametric flow cytometry and CyTOF were not available.",

            "text": "In a study published in 2008, frequencies of CD56+ CD69+ NK cells were found to be more activated in hospitalized Vietnamese infants with more severe dengue disease [15]. Recently Petitdemange et al. evaluated NK cell activation in patients from Gabon undergoing acute dengue infection [59]. They examined frequencies of subsets of NK cells and included a number of NK cell receptors NKp30, NKG2A, NKp44 and CD161 which was a significant advance from the early studies where only CD56 expression was used to identify NK cells. Compared to healthy donors, NK cells from patients who had DENV-2 infections expressed significantly less NKp30, NKG2A, and CD161, whereas expression of ILT-2 was increased at the early acute and convalescent time point. Interestingly, frequencies of NKp44+ NK cells were elevated at the early acute time point. Principal component analysis highlighted an association between NKp44 and DENV-2 infections. NKp44 has previously been shown to directly interact with the envelope protein of DENV and WNV and this subset of NK cells and its ligand in target cells is worthy of study in other cohorts [30]. While there have been only a few studies that have looked at NK cell responses in clinical cohorts, the data indicate that subsets of NK cells are involved in the immune responses to natural dengue infection thus warranting further study. NK cell responses in individuals receiving live attenuated tetravalent dengue vaccines have not been examined in any detail. Whether different subsets of NK cells respond to vaccination with live attenuated dengue vaccines versus subunit vaccines and inactivated vaccine antigens are currently unknown. Furthermore, whether the magnitude of NK cell responses is different between vaccination and natural infection has not been explored.",

In a subsequent study by the same group, MICB was also associated with the less severe form of dengue DF in both children and adults in Vietnam [77]. This genetic susceptibility of a SNP in MICB was confirmed in another study in the Thai population. In Cuban individuals (Guzman), a strong association of DF and DHF with MICA 008 and MICB 008 compared to asymptomatic individuals [24]. Interestingly soluble MICB levels were increased in the sera between pre-infection and acute illness among infants with symptomatic primary DENV infections in the Philippines and suggest an immune evasion strategy in dengue viral infection [43]. The data suggest that ligands for the activating receptor NKG2D, MICB may be involved in the immune response against DENV.",

CD16 engagement is a strong activator of NK cell function and allows antigen-specific recruitment of NK responses. Very early on, NK cell-mediated lysis of DENV-2-infected Raji cells was significantly higher when these cells were pre-incubated with DENV immune serum through antibody dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) [38]. More recently efforts have been made to understand in a prospective cohort whether ADCC activity in sera obtained pre-illness in a prospective cohort correlated with subsequent dengue disease severity and viremia levels. A higher level of ADCC activity measured in immune sera before secondary DENV-3 but not secondary DENV-2 infection was associated with lower subsequent viremia levels [41]. These results suggest a protective role for ADCC antibodies in sera obtained from in some children with secondary infection. In vivo, characteristics of both the Abs and NK cells in each individual are likely to impact the function of these Abs. Future studies should compare the contribution of functionally distinct Abs (those that mediate neutralization versus Abs that mediate ADCC) in the sera of individuals who subsequently develop clinical versus subclinical disease.",

However, several studies have shown that inhibitory KIRs are also sensitive to the specific peptides bound by the HLA molecules [12]. In particular, residues 7 and 8 of endogenously derived peptides bound to MHC class I can promote or abrogate binding of KIR. During viral infection, the peptide repertoire changes and a number of viral peptides are presented on MHC molecules for recognition by cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Changes in the endogenous repertoire of peptides can perturb or continue to maintain inhibition of NK cells (Fig. 18.2) depending on how strongly the viral peptide is able to bind and replace the endogenous peptide. Several viral peptides (HIV, HCV, SIV) have been shown to modulate KIR-MHC interactions thus providing a mechanism for the virus to modulate the interaction of the inhibitory KIR with its MHC ligand thus preventing the activation of subsets of NK cells [22, 47]. How changes in the peptide repertoire following viral infection alter NK cell recognition in vivo will depend on the relative amounts of viral peptides being presented, the nature of the peptides produced by infection and the frequency of NK cells expressing the relevant KIR.\n\n",

Using depletion studies and KIR-transfected cell lines, the HLA B57 restricted dengue NS1 tetramer was found to bind the inhibitory receptor KIR3DL1 on NK cells clearly demonstrating an interaction with an inhibitory KIR. Using clinical samples from a long-standing cohort in Thailand the authors further found late activation of NK cells in HLA B57+ individuals. The peak of NK cell activation occurred at the critical time point in people with severe dengue disease which supported the hypothesis that the HLA B57 restricted NS1 peptide can modulate the function of KIR3DL1+ NK cells. The data strongly suggest that subpopulations of NK cells may contribute to disease pathogenesis and enabled the authors to speculate how the NS1 peptide may modulate function during acute dengue infection. At steady state (Fig. 18.1a), the interaction of an HLA B57 presenting endogenous peptides on an antigen presenting cell (APC) with KIR3DL1 maintains an inhibitory signal in NK cells thus preventing lysis of healthy target APCs. During many viral infections, HLA molecules are downregulated which allows NK cells to get activated and lyse virus-infected APCs (Fig. 18.1b). However it is well known that in DENV infection HLA class I molecules are upregulated [79]. We hypothesize that presentation of the NS1 peptide on HLA B57 during the viremic phase in infected individuals maintains the inhibitory interaction with KIR3DL1 (since the tetramer has been shown to bind KIR3DL1) thus delaying the activation of this important subset of NK cells (Fig. 18.1c, d). As viremia decreases, Class I expression decreases and NK cells are able to sense the change in Class I expression, triggering their activation during the critical phase of illness (around fever day 0) (Fig. 18.1d). Our clinical data support our hypothesis but we are yet to show functional alteration of NK cell responses by the NS1 peptide.",

Petitdemange et al. found no evidence of a role for KIR genotypes in patients infected with DENV-2. In contrast, Beltrame et al. detected an association between certain KIR genes and their cognate HLA ligands in the context of infection with DENV-3 in Southern Brazil [3, 57]. Differences in population origin and the infecting DENV serotype may explain these disparate results. Petitdemange et al. in a subsequent paper assessed NK cell activation by multiparametric flow cytometry in patients with DENV-2, CHIKV or in a few subjects with co-infections [59]. They found different signatures of NK cell responses between the two infections. NK cells in CHIKV infection were activated early and expressed a terminal differentiation pattern with prolonged persistence of NKG2C + CD57+ cells which the authors speculate may contribute to the chronic arthralgia seen in CHIKV infection. DENV-2 infections were associated with an increase in KIR2DL1+ NK cells which recognize HLA-C2.

Waggoner et al. used the model of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), to show that NK cells can regulate CD4 T-cell-mediated support for the antiviral CD8 T cells [74, 76]. NK cells have also been shown to be important for long-term CD4+ T cell memory and subsequent antibody responses [18]. The data suggest that NK cells continue to participate in immune modulation well after initial infection when NK cells are traditionally thought to be active. In a previous study of CD8+ T cells by Townsley et al. frequencies of the HLA-B57-restricted epitope, were assessed over the course of acute DENV infection [71]. Given the highly conserved nature of this epitope, we predicted that PBMC from donors with secondary dengue infection would have significantly higher frequencies of B57-NS126\u201334 CD8+ T cells compared to PBMC from donors with primary dengue infection. While we detected tetramer-positive T cells in all subjects tested, the frequencies in subjects with secondary infections were not higher than in subjects with primary infections, with one exception. We speculated that an unidentified factor may dampen activation of CD8+ T cells directed at this epitope but had not yet identified that the NS1 peptide presented on HLA-B57 could bind KIR3DL1 an inhibitory receptor on NK cells. Our new findings suggest that NK cells could shape CD8+ T cell responses but given the lack of an authentic animal model that mimics human dengue infection it will be challenging to provide definite proof that inhibitory NK cells can modulate adaptive responses at the epitope level in vivo.",

Furthermore, for meaningful comparisons to be made samples must be collected at multiple points and compared in subjects with mild and severe dengue disease rather than compare responses in all subjects with dengue disease and responses in healthy subjects. Since the hallmark of dengue hemorrhagic fever DHF (severe disease) is plasma leakage, if NK cells are hypothesized to contribute to DHF, then changes in the frequency or function of subsets of NK cells during or prior to defervescence the critical phase of illness must be demonstrated. In vitro assays will need to be performed in order to understand which receptors and ligands interact with virus-infected cells and are important for cytokine production and cytolytic activity in subsets of NK cells following DENV infection as little information exists to date. Basic biological studies of NK cells and multiple studies using clinical samples in chronic viral infections suggest that subsets of NK cells are an important contributor to the overall immune response. We have a partial understanding of how NK cells can regulate dengue immune responses but these findings point to multiple avenues whereby NK cells may control DENV infection and shape adaptive immune responses.",

To date, only NKp44 has been shown to directly interact with the E protein of DENV. NK cells can interact with DENV infected APCs by responding to cytokines, interacting with yet to be identified ligands on virus-infected cells and upregulating inhibitory or activating receptors on its surface. This may lead to degranulation and abundant cytokine secretion by NK cells and lysis of virus-infected cells. Alternatively, dominant interaction of inhibitory receptors on NK cells with viral proteins and peptides could dampen responses and represent an immune evasion strategy by DENV. NK cells can also be directed to DENV infected APCs through engagement of CD16 with the Fc receptor of DENV-specific Abs and target cells are lysed through ADCC",

Specific amino acid changes in the peptides presented by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I can impact KIR recognition of peptide/MHC complexes. We hypothesize that the DENV NS1 peptide generated during infection presented by HLA B57 alters the affinity of the inhibitory KIR3DL1 receptor expressed on NK cells for its putative ligand, resulting in the inhibition of NK cells early during viral infection while MHC class I is upregulated. Following the clearance of viremia, HLA-B57 levels return to normal which decreases the inhibitory signal received by KIR3DL1+ NK cells. This release of inhibition allows KIR3DL1+ NK cells to be activated at fever day 0, coincident with the activation of CD8+ T cells",
