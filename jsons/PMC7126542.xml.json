            "text": "Spring viraemia of carp virus (SVCV), belonging to the family Rhabdoviridae, is responsible for the highly lethal spring viraemia of carp (SVC) and is a grave viral threat that continues to infect cyprinids, especially common carp (Cyprinus carpio) (Shao et al., 2015). Until now, SVCV has widely spread to Asia, Europe, America and Russia, and this implies that SVCV infection is rapidly expanding along with the increasingly frequent national and international trade (Goodwin, 2002, Dikkeboom et al., 2004, Warg et al., 2007, Miller et al., 2007, Phelps et al., 2012). Notably, in addition to spread among fish, SVCV infection can also be spread through parasitic and fomites invertebrates (Fijian, 1984, Ahne et al., 2002). Thus, it is difficult to eradicate the virus from affected ponds, and the only effective treatment to block SVCV infection is elimination and sanitation of all infected aquatic life (Ahne et al., 2002, Shao et al., 2015, Ashraf et al., 2016).",

Traditionally, DNA or oral vaccine is an important way to resolve viral diseases in aquaculture (Zhu et al., 2014, Emmenegger and Kurath, 2008, Cui et al., 2015). However, their use in aquaculture is still restricted due to the handling stress on fish, as well as high labour and production costs (Life, 2008). Moreover, RNA-mediated interference has also been reported to inhibit SVCV infection in vitro (Gotesman et al., 2015), but it takes a long time for this new technology to be put into production (Chen et al., 2015). Hence, there is no effective treatment for controlling SVCV in aquaculture up to now (Ashraf et al., 2016).",

            "text": "Recently, more and more natural compounds that are extracted from natural plants were found with antiviral activity. For example, saikosaponin A and C extracted from Radix bupleuri, and arctigenin (ARG) from Fructus Arctii showed antiviral activities against human coronavirus 229E and human immunodeficiency virus type-1, respectively (Cheng et al., 2006, Vlietinck et al., 1998); meanwhile, dioscin and angelicin isolated from Psoralea corylifolia inhibited the replication of adenovirus and gammaherpesviruses, separately (Liu et al., 2013, Cho et al., 2013). Remarkably, the application of natural compounds to control viral disease in aquaculture has attracted increasing attention due to their demonstrable efficacy and low environmental hazard. Chen et al. (2017) discovered that magnolol and honokiol extracted from Magnolia officinalis demonstrated a notably antiviral activity against grass carp reovirus. Additionally, ribavirin and other common antiviral agents have been reported to block a variety of virus infection (Butt and Kanwal, 2011, Yau and Yoshida, 2014, Debing et al., 2014), including aquatic animal virus (Yu et al., 2016, Zhu et al., 2015). However, antiviral agent against SVCV is still scarce until now (Shao et al., 2016). Hence, it is feasible to find anti-SVCV agents from natural compounds and common antiviral agents.",

Because ARG was highly effective to SVCV, we first speculated if ARG could damage the structure of glycoprotein and affect SVCV infectivity. However, we found that ARG had no effect on SVCV infectivity. This indicated that the structure of glycoprotein cannot be damaged by ARG directly in vitro. Linked with the study of Hayashi et al.

On the other hand, oxidative stress was confirmed as a mediator of apoptosis in virus-infected cells (Li et al., 2016).

Some viruses inhibited this pathway for their survival, while others enhanced to benefit this pathway (Sir and Ou, 2010). SVCV had been found inducing autophagy in EPC cells, which is required for necessary viral replication (Liu et al., 2015b). Here, we found that the autophagy induced by SVCV was inhibited by ARG treatment. This inhibition on autophagy might be caused by the following two reasons: 1) ARG had a direct effect on autophagy and then inhibited SVCV replication; 2) ARG inhibited SVCV-induced autophagy via suppressing SVCV first. By treating EPC cells with ARG alone, we found that ARG did not inhibit autophagy directly, and thus, its inhibition on SVCV-induced autophagy was mainly caused by the second reason. Since SVCV glycoprotein, rather than viral replication, activates autophagy pathway (Liu et al., 2015b), it should be important to emphasize that ARG had no effect on SVCV infectivity, which implied ARG could not damage the structure of SVCV glycoprotein. These also indicated that ARG could not inhibit SVCV-induced autophagy directly. Although autophagy was not the primary molecular target of ARG, the inhibition of ARG on SVCV-induced autophagy occurred indeed, and this could be beneficial to the host cell to combat virus infection in some extent.",

Mechanistically, ARG had no effect on SVCV infectivity and did not induce ROS generation. However, ARG suppressed the autophagy induced by SVCV. Taken together, ARG is regarded as a compound with high anti-SVCV activity and is expected to be a therapeutic agent against SVCV infection. Our further work will pay attention to the antiviral activity of ARG in vivo.",
