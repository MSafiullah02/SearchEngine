            "text": "The global pig industry produced approximately 963 million pigs and 109 million metric tons of pork in 2011 (http://faostat.fao.org). Respiratory diseases are considered to be one of the main contributors to economic losses in the swine industry (Opriessnig et al., 2011). The 2006 United States Department of Agriculture (U.S.D.A.) National Animal Health Monitoring System (NAHMS) study of 435 swine production sites with 100 or more pigs from 17 major pork\u2010producing States showed that respiratory problems are the main cause of nursery deaths (53.7%) and grower/finisher pig mortality (60.1%) (United States Department of Agriculture, 2008). In Canada, 37\u201378% of pigs going for slaughter have cranioventral bronchopneumonia (Hansen et al., 2010a). Porcine respiratory disease complex (PRDC) is multifactorial, with both infectious and non\u2010infectious factors contributing to respiratory disease and predominantly seen in pigs between the ages of 3 and 6 months (Opriessnig et al., 2011). The interaction of viral and bacterial pathogens, environmental factors, pig\u2010specific factors and management conditions all contribute to the development and impact the severity of PRDC (Opriessnig et al., 2011).",

However, viruses most commonly associated with PRDC include porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) (Rammohan et al., 2012), porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) (Ellis et al., 2004; Genzow et al., 2009), influenza A virus (IAV) and porcine respiratory corona virus (PRCV) (Pensaert et al., 1986; Jung et al., 2009; Renukaradhya et al., 2010). Bacteria such as Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae (M. hyopneumoniae) (Hansen et al., 2010b), Pasteurella multocida (P. multocida) (Davies, 2004), Salmonella enterica serovar Choleraesuis (S.e Choleraesuis) (Reed et al., 1986; Asai et al., 2010) and Streptococcus suis (S. suis) (Done and Paton, 1995; Silva et al., 2006; Baums et al., 2007) are also commonly associated with PRDC.",

            "text": "Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus is a major cause of swine production losses worldwide, and in the United States, reproductive and growing pig losses are an estimated $560 million per year (Neumann et al., 2005). PRRSV (genus Arterivirus, family Arteriviridae) is an enveloped virus with a single\u2010stranded, positive\u2010sense RNA genome of approximately 15 kb. PRRSV is classified into two types with type 1 predominating in Europe and type 2 predominating in North America and Asia. PCV2 (genus Circovirus, family Ciroviridae) is a non\u2010enveloped virus with a circular, covalently closed single\u2010stranded DNA genome of 1767\u20131768 nucleotides (Meehan et al., 1997; Hamel et al., 1998). IAV (genus Influenzavirus A, family Orthomyxoviridae) are enveloped viruses with a genome composed of eight single\u2010stranded negative\u2010sense RNA segments. PRCV (genus Alphacoronavirus, family Coronaviridae) are enveloped viruses with a single\u2010stranded positive\u2010sense RNA genome of approximately 28.5 kb. It was first isolated in Belgium in 1984, and it is a natural variant of transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) (Pensaert et al., 1986) that contains a 5\u2032 deletion (621\u2013681 nt in size) in the S gene which is used to differentiate PRCV from TGEV in PCR\u2010based assays (Kim et al., 2000; Costantini et al., 2004). PRCV often causes subclinical infections. M. hyopneumoniae (Hansen et al., 2010b) causes mycoplasmal pneumonia of swine and is known to be one of the most common and economically important diseases found in pig farms worldwide, having low mortality, but high morbidity (Otagiri et al., 2005). P. multocida is a commensal found in the upper respiratory tract of pigs, but can also act as a primary or secondary pathogen responsible for pneumonia (Davies, 2004) and atrophic rhinitis in pigs (Tang et al., 2009). S. e. Choleraesuis is a host adapted Salmonella serovar responsible for almost all types of salmonellosis in pigs in North America and Europe (Kingsley and Baumler, 2000). S. suis is a Gram\u2010positive, zoonotic bacterial pathogen important in polyserositis, septicaemia, arthritis, pneumonia and endocarditis in pigs (Done and Paton, 1995; Silva et al., 2006; Baums et al., 2007). Some of these bacteria are of low pathogenicity and exist as commensals in the upper respiratory tract of healthy pigs. They can cause severe respiratory disease by invading tissues already damaged due to a primary pathogen(s) (virus or bacteria), general immunosuppression and other factors such as poor environmental conditions and poor management practices.",

            "text": "Routine diagnostic methods for detection of viruses implicated in PRDC include virus isolation in cell culture, antigen detection by direct fluorescent antibody staining, and enzyme immunoassay and culture\u2010based methods for bacteria. Such methods (Grau\u2010Roma and Segales, 2007) are time\u2010consuming and require independent tests for each pathogen. Furthermore, the detection of bacterial pathogens typically depends on time\u2010consuming culture\u2010based methods that can take several days to obtain results. Due to their high sensitivity and ease of use, PCR and real\u2010time PCR tests have been developed for several agents implicated in the PRDC; however, these tests typically target single pathogens (Lierz et al., 2008; Lomonaco et al., 2009; Tang et al., 2009). A diagnostic test capable of simultaneous detection of multiple pathogens involved in PRDC (Atashpaz et al., 2009; Wernike et al., 2012; Xu et al., 2012) would save time, labour and cost by providing more information with each test performed. A multiplex PCR assay capable of detecting five porcine viruses including two porcine respiratory viruses was developed (Giammarioli et al., 2008). Duplex and triplex real\u2010time PCR for porcine respiratory viruses have also been recently described (Chang et al., 2014; Wu et al., 2014). However, to date, there are no diagnostic tests capable of simultaneous detection of multiple major viral and bacterial porcine respiratory pathogens in a single reaction. Microarray technology, with its capacity to incorporate a large number of capture probes, is a potentially useful tool for multiplexed detection and typing of pathogens. Here, a microarray assay with associated multiplex RT\u2010PCRs for detection and differentiation of four viruses and four bacteria involved in PRDC using a novel user\u2010friendly electronic microarray in which capture probe printing, hybridization, washing and reporting are fully integrated and automated is described. The electronic microarray contains 400 test sites which can be activated independently via electrodes and utilizes electrophoretically driven hybridization that can be completed instantaneously.",

The probes were screened against a panel of five isolates representing the four target viruses, and three non\u2010target viruses, and 11 strains representing the four target bacteria, and 11 non\u2010target bacteria (Table 3). Microarray data were represented using the mean pixel intensity for each probe reaction. Probe reactivity was calculated using the mean pixel fluorescent intensity (MFI) of all probes as a ratio of the non\u2010template control. Probe reactions above 2\u00d7 the ratio of the non\u2010template control were considered positive. Probes that showed good reactivity and specificity were selected for testing and validation on a novel automated electronic microarray in which capture probes are printed on streptavidin\u2010containing acrylamide hydrogels and hybridization, washing and reporting are automated and computer controlled. Capture probes used on the electronic microarray were modified with 5\u2032\u2010biotin group to allow attachment to streptavidin\u2010containing test sites (IDT, Coralville, IA, USA). A selected set of 12 probes targeting the viruses, 14 probes targeting the bacteria and three control probes (a negative probe and two probes targeting the internal control), which exhibited high reactivity and specificity on glass slide microarrays, were selected for validation on the electronic microarray. The viral probes were tested against an expanded panel of 14 strains or isolates of the four target viruses and 14 non\u2010target viruses (Table 3). Similarly, the bacterial probes were tested against a panel of 20 strains or isolates representing the four target bacteria and 20 related or unrelated non\u2010target bacteria (Table 3). The electronic microarray assays were run using a protocol previously described (Lung et al., 2012) with modifications. The modifications included the replacement of the \u2018touch down\u2019 washing protocol with a \u2018touch up\u2019 protocol in which washing steps were carried out using Low Salt Buffer (Nexogen, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) with incremental increases rather than decreases in temperature. Images were captured at each temperature increment. The Red Universal Reporter Probe was replaced with a 5\u2032\u2010Alexa Fluor 647 modified locked nucleic acid (LNA) variant (5\u2032\u2010/5Alex647N/TGT+CA+AGCG+AT+AT+ACT+GC\u20103\u2032) (IDT, Coralville, IA, USA) to increase its thermal stability over a more robust range of wash temperatures. All electronic microarray hybridizations were performed in duplicate, and a non\u2010template PCR control (NTC) was included in all experiments. Raw fluorescent intensity (FI) data from all utilized electrodes at each temperature increment were obtained and analysed using Microsoft Excel. For each probe, positive\u2010to\u2010non\u2010template control (P : N) ratios were calculated by dividing the FI value from each analyte by the FI value produced by the NTC. For each assay, samples that produced P : N ratios of 2.0 or greater were considered positive. Average P : N data derived from the microarrays were visualized with a heat map generated using TreeView v. 1.60 (Eisen et al., 1998).",

Subsequently, the assay was adapted to a novel, rapid and user\u2010friendly microarray platform that automates and integrates capture probe printing with all post\u2010PCR steps of the assay, including electrophoretically driven hybridization, washing and reporting. The automated electronic microarray assay reduces the labour, time and number of instruments needed to acquire microarray results when compared with conventional microarrays which typically require substantial manual processing, slower passive hybridization of amplicons with capture probes and multiple pieces of equipment. The electronic microarray has an open platform format with 400 test sites that can be individually activated and utilizes a single integrated instrument that automates capture probe printing and microarray processing using parameters set by the user. Thus, the novel technology also reduces the skill level required to perform microarray assays and allows immediate, on\u2010site modification of assays depending on the needs of the end\u2010user. These unique features eliminate the need for anticipation of future needs, and the procurement and storage of manufactured arrays that are designed for a specific set of predetermined pathogens. For example, the system will allow immediate switching between assays that detects/types all eight pathogens simultaneously to one that detects/types a subset of the pathogens, or to assays for detection and typing of other pathogens. As the user is able to control hybridization, wash and reporting temperature the assay can have excellent specificity and can be used for differentiating variants that are genetically very similar. However, the automated electronic microarray assay requires specialized arrays and investment in instrumentation. The cost of consumables for testing a sample with an electronic microarray is expected to be between one and a few real\u2010time PCR assays and will depend on the assay design (i.e. reducing the number of probes will decrease the cost by allowing more samples to be tested on each array with 400 test sites). In addition to glass and hydrogel (acrylamide)\u2010based microarray matrices used in this study, the final probe sets have been tested successfully on reverse dot blots performed on nylon membranes (unpublished results). Thus, the probe set described should have broad applications in hybridization\u2010based assays that use a variety of different matrices.",

The limit of detection of a LAMP assay for PCV2 has been shown to be approximately 1 copy of DNA plasmid, much more sensitive than conventional PCR whose detection limit was 1 \u00d7 104 copies (Zhou et al., 2011). However, LAMP assays typically detect a single pathogen and are difficult to multiplex. In multiplex real\u2010time PCR assays, a duplex PCR assay had a detection limit of 1 TCID50/ml for PCV2 and 6.3 TCID50/ml for PRRSV (Chang et al., 2014), while a triplex real\u2010time PCR assay had a detection sensitivity of 10 copies/\u03bcl for PCV2 and PRSV and 100 copies/\u03bcl for PPV (Wu et al., 2014). The multiplex PCR described here did not reduce the limits of detection for five targets although the detection limit of the PCR for three pathogens was an order of magnitude lower in the multiplex format. Thus, further improvements in sensitivity are desirable and may be partly achieved by increasing the number of PCR cycles, reducing amplicon lengths or reducing the amount of internal control used in the assay. The limit of detection for PCV2, PRRSV, and M. hyoneumoniae was lower with the electronic microarray in comparison with the multiplex RT\u2010PCR indicating the use of the electronic microarray platform reduces sensitivity, and unpublished results show that only amplicons that were visible after agarose gel electrophoresis can be detected by the electronic microarray. Despite the reduced analytical sensitivity of the electronic microarray assay for some of the targets, the bacterial and viral targets were detected singly or in combination in clinical samples submitted for laboratory diagnosis. Furthermore, the assay detected P. multocida in a clinical lung sample that was not detected by traditional culture methods. This discrepancy may be due to the higher sensitivity of the microarray assay, or the lack of active infection (e.g. the use of antibiotics).",

The high\u2010density Virochip is a useful tool for virus discovery, but needs approximately 24 h to obtain results and requires high viral titre for positive detection.
