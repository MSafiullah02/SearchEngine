A few weeks later, these cases were determined to be associated with SARS-CoV-2 (2). Since then, the disease has spanned beyond national boundaries, manifesting itself in all of the continents now, except for Antarctica. As of May 4, 2020, the Johns Hopkins Testing is not widely and readily available, and lack of personal protective equipment is generating significant pressure for healthcare workers on the frontline.",

            "text": "Given these factors, most healthcare centers are delaying elective non-urgent procedures and even cancer screenings have been stopped. However, not all procedures can be postponed. Some of the strategies discussed in the paper include triaging of febrile patients at separate clinics with exclusive staff, reduction of outpatient visits, implementation of distancing and personal protective equipment guidelines, geographic assignment to dedicated wards with corresponding staff, utilizing frequent disinfection processes, and testing and self-quarantine for those employees who are symptomatic or at high risk due to exposure. A special emphasis is placed on testing and imaging of patients, due to the risk of transmission from asymptomatic carriers. A combination of nucleic acid testing, antibody testing, and CT scan of the chest is proposed by the authors. One pivotal recommendation highlighted in this article for critical but stable patients is repeating the nucleic acid test within 24 hours. This is important to overcome false negative test results. Once in the operating room, the investigators recommended limiting the number of staff to the bare minimum, exercising extreme caution during the intubation and extubation procedures, and considering specialized filters to reduce transmission of aerosolized particles (1).",
