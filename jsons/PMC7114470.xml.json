            "text": "Porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) is a devastating swine disease that is characterized by acute enteritis and lethal watery diarrhea followed by dehydration leading to death with a high mortality rate in piglets (Debouck and Pensaert, 1980, Pensaert and Yeo, 2006, Pijpers et al., 1993). The disease was first recognized in England in 1971 (Oldham, 1972), and since then, outbreaks have been reported in Europe and Asia (Chen et al., 2008, Pensaert et al., 1981, Puranaveja et al., 2009, Takahashi et al., 1983). The causative agent of this disease, the PED virus (PEDV), was first described in 1978 (Pensaert and Debouck, 1978). Thereafter, a suitable cell culture system for PEDV propagation was developed and successfully used for virus isolation (Hofmann and Wyler, 1988). In Korea, PEDV was first recognized in 1992 (Kweon et al., 1993); however, a retrospective study indicated that the virus had already existed as early as 1987 (Park and Lee, 1997). Since the emergence, a periodic vaccination strategy has been applied nationwide to control the disease on pig farms but PEDV outbreaks have continuously occurred causing tremendous economical losses to the Korean swine industry.",

The PEDV genome is composed of the 5\u2032 untranslated region (UTR), at least 7 open reading frames (ORF1a, ORF1b, and ORF2\u20136), and the 3\u2032 UTR (Kocherhans et al., 2001). The two large ORF1a and 1b cover the 5\u2032 two-third of the genome and encode the non-structural replicase genes. The remaining ORFs in the 3\u2032 terminal region code for four major structural proteins, the 150\u2013220 kDa glycosylated spike (S) protein, 20\u201330 kDa membrane (M) protein, 7 kDa envelop (E) protein, and 58 kDa nucleocapsid (N) protein (Duarte and Laude, 1994, Pensaert and Yeo, 2006).",

In addition, the S protein can be divided into S1 (1\u2013735 aa) and S2 (736\u20131383 aa) domains based on its homology with S proteins of other coronaviruses (Jackwood et al., 2001, Sturman and Holmes, 1984). As with other coronavirus S proteins, the PEDV S glycoprotein is known to play pivotal roles in interacting with the cellular receptor to mediate viral entry and inducing neutralizing antibodies in the natural host (Bosch et al., 2003, Chang et al., 2002, Godet et al., 1994). Thus, the S glycoprotein would be a primary target for the development of effective vaccines against PEDV. It is also the major envelope glycoprotein found in the virion, which serves as an important viral component in the study to understand genetic relationships among PEDV isolates and the epidemiological status of PEDV in the field (Park et al., 2007b, Puranaveja et al., 2009, Spaan et al., 1988). In the present study, therefore, we sought to determine the full-length sequences of the S glycoproteins of PEDV field isolates in order to investigate genetic relatedness and to understand the diversity and prevalence of PEDV isolates in Korea.",

Briefly, viral RNA was extracted from the PBS-diluted or homogenized samples with the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Reverse transcription (RT) was performed by using 1 \u03bcg of viral RNA, specific reverse primers, and SuperScript III First-Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) according to the manual provided by the manufacturer. PCR was conducted to amplify each cDNA fragment from the RT product by using TaKaRa Ex Taq DNA polymerase (TaKaRa, Japan) according to the manufacturer's protocol under the following conditions; denaturation at 94 \u00b0C for 5 min, 30 cycles of denaturation at 94 \u00b0C for 30 s, annealing at 58 \u00b0C for 30 s and extension at 72 \u00b0C for 2 min, followed by a final extension at 72 \u00b0C for 10 min. The individual cDNA amplicons were gel-purified, cloned into pGEM-T easy (Promega, Madison, WI), and sequenced in both directions using two commercial vector-specific T7 and SP6 primers and the S gene-specific primers. General procedures for DNA manipulation and cloning were performed according to standard procedures (Sambrook and Russell, 2001).

The sequence data found that the S genes of seven Korean PEDV isolates (KNU-0801, KNU-0802, and KNU-0901\u2013KNU-0905) consisted of 4161 nucleotides (nt) in length, which encoded 1386 amino acid residues. The complete nucleotide sequences of the Korean PEDV isolates were further compared to those of reference PEDV strains described in Table 2. The full-length S genes of the Korean PEDV isolates were determined to be 9 nt (3 amino acids) longer in size than that of other PEDV strains. This consequence was due to the presence of the number of inserted or deleted nucleotides that was accumulated in the N-terminus of the S1 domain (Fig. 1\n). Remarkably, the first notable insertion existed at amino acid positions 56\u201359 of the S protein for all seven Korean PEDV isolates followed by the presence of one additional inserted aspartic acid residue at position 140. Interestingly, the unique deletion was also located between amino acids 156 and 157 of the PEDV S protein, which is commonly present in reference PEDV strains. The S proteins of seven Korean PEDV isolates contained 25\u201327 potential N-linked glycosylation sites (identified by the sequence NXS/T, where X is any amino acid except proline). Deletion or modification of N-glycosylation sites was found predominantly in the N-terminus of the S1 domain. Furthermore, the largest number of amino acid differences was also clustered in the N-terminal region of the S1 domain. In addition, the genetic distances between the query strain CV777 and the Korean field isolates were plotted against the nucleotide position. Likewise, the N-terminal region of the S1 domain (1\u2013800 bp) showed the lowest similarity with the PEDV reference strain (Fig. 2\n). Taken together, our data indicate that the S1 domain including the peptide signal sequences of the Korean field isolates contain regions that exhibited sequence hypervariablity.",

Unlike the result obtained above, the full S gene-based phylogenetic tree revealed that all PEDV strains and field isolates used in the present study were defined into two separate clusters (Fig. 3B). The first cluster (group 1; G1) included the PEDV reference strains, Korean vaccine strains (SM98P and DR13) and all Chinese strains. In contrast, the second cluster (group 2; G2) contained all Korean field isolates, including previously identified Korean field isolates Spk1 and Chinju99 that were reported formerly to belong to G2 and G3 in the S1 C-terminal based phylogenetic tree, respectively (Park et al., 2007b). These data indicated that the Korean field isolates were more closely related to each other rather than other reference strains. More importantly, the phylogenetic trees based on the nucleotides representing either the S1 domain or the S1 N-terminal part were most closely similar to the tree based on the full-length S gene in that they also exhibit two distinct phylogenetic groups (Fig. 3C and D, compared to Fig. 3B). This result suggests that only the N-terminal region of the S1 domain would be sufficient for revealing genetic relatedness among the different PEDV isolates. Subsequent phylogenetic analyses on the basis of the amino acid sequences further showed the same results as found in the nucleotide-based phylogeny (data not shown).",

For viral entry, the S protein recognizes the cellular receptor via specific interactions and in the natural host, it is responsible for mediating viral neutralizing antibodies (Bosch et al., 2003, Chang et al., 2002). In addition, the S protein gene is considered the most useful in revealing the genetic diversity of coronavirus isolates (Kim et al., 2003, Paton and Lowings, 1997, Puranaveja et al., 2009, S\u00e1nchez et al., 1992). Indeed, sequence analysis based on the S protein genes of PEDV isolates has been recently reported to show the diversity of Korean PEDV isolates (Park et al., 2007b). However, this previous study assessed only partial S protein genes including the epitope region (Chang et al., 2002), thereby implying that the data might not represent the results expected from the full S gene-based analysis. A more precise study with the full S genes will be needed to better understand the genetic relationships among prevailing PEDVs in Korea. In the current study, therefore, the complete nucleotide and deduced peptide sequences of the S protein genes of seven Korean PEDV isolates were determined and compared with those of published PEDV reference strains. As consistent with the previous study, we demonstrated that Korean PEDV isolates undergo the genetic diversity in their S glycoprotein genes, and notably distinct results were obtained in our study.",

The similarity plot showed that most of the diversity between the G1 and G2 clusters is located within the 5\u2032 most 800 nt of the S gene. Although further studies would be needed to investigate this phenomenon, it might be explained by a possible recombination event with an unknown PEDV strain or other porcine coronaviruses in the field. In addition, the S1 N-terminus showed the high occurrence of amino acid mutations that led to the creation or elimination of potential N-glycosylation sites. Thus, this N-terminal part of the S1 domain contains several potential hypervariable regions which will be useful in differentiating specific PEDV isolates and in studying genetic relatedness among field isolates.",

(2007b) previously revealed that PEDV isolates are divided into three separate groups based on the partial S gene including the C-terminal region of S1 domain. In that study, most Korean isolates were found to belong to the group 1 and to be highly homologous to reference strains that includes CV777, Br1/87, Korean vaccine strains, and the Chinese strain JS-2004-2. It was further reported that the Korean isolates were distantly related to other previously identified Korean field isolates Spk1 and Chinju99. These results were reproducible in the current analysis of the same region with Korean isolates, reference strains, and Thailand isolates. However, the full S gene-based phylogenetic analysis in the present study resulted in two distinct clusters. PEDV reference strains including Korean vaccine strains and Chinese isolates were determined to belong to the group 1, whereas all Korean field isolates including Spk1 and Chinju99 were clustered together within the group 2. These data demonstrate that prevalent PEDV isolates in Korea are more closely related to each other and to other previously identified Korean isolates Spk 1 and Chinju99 rather than reference strains (CV777 and Br1/87), Korean vaccine strains (DR13 and SM98P), and all Chinese strains (DX, JS-2004-2, LJB/03, and LZC). The reason for the contradictory result is likely due to the difference of the target region analyzed between the previous and present studies, which led to the contrary interpretation of the sequence phylogeny. Nevertheless, our study indicates that the genetic analysis based on the C-terminal part of the S1 domain, including the epitope region, does not represent the entire S gene-based analysis, thereby displaying inconsistent results in the present study. It is further noteworthy that the phylogenetic tree topologies based on the S1 domain and the S1 N-terminus correspond well to the full S gene-based tree. This indicates that the N-terminal region of the S1 domain will be required for analyzing the relationships and diversity of PEDV isolates in future studies.",
