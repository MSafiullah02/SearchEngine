The first coronaviruses discovered were the cause of pediatric and adult respiratory infections that were not particularly dangerous. One study from Vanderbilt found coronavirus in about 5% of samples from upper respiratory illness and 8% from lower respiratory illness [1]. Most clinically significant coronavirus infections have been found in children < 2 years of age, as reviewed in this journal in 2009 [2], although adults also might suffer severe infections [3, 4]. This was the picture as late as 2018: a group of respiratory viruses that could cause serious illness in the very young, but with negligible mortality [5, 6].",

Moreover, serologic studies show that MERS infection is common in Saudi Arabia, where contact with camels is common but also where human-to-human infection occurs [12]. There are several candidate vaccines against MERS being developed by an international organization, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness (CEPI; see below) [13].",

Research on the latter virus concluded that SARS is likely a virus with a reservoir in bats [14], which can infect small mammals such as the palm civet. The latter are considered to be a delicacy to eat by some Chinese, and are sold in many markets in China. The source of SARS is thought to be from a market in Guandong. However, as the receptor for coronavirus is present in human lungs, direct infection from bats may be possible [15], all the more so because the bat coronavirus that has been isolated is genetically close to SARS [16]. Although SARS no longer circulates in humans, candidate vaccines were developed but never licensed [17\u201321].",

Although mortality seems to be lower than in the case of SARS, many of the infections cause lower respiratory tract disease requiring hospitalization. Although yet to be confirmed at this writing, it is likely that SARS-CoV-2 originated from infections transferred from small mammals in the Wuhan market to humans. In any case, it is now spreading by human-to-human contact. Respiratory secretions of infected individuals contain virus, and there is some evidence that virus may be excreted in stool. Obviously, much information is unpublished but is being exchanged through the World Health Organization (WHO) and websites. Sequences of SARS-CoV-2 show 82% homology with SARS and there is some cross-neutralization by SARS antiserum against SARS-CoV-2, but probably not enough to be useful in protecting human populations [14].",

The current focus is to develop antibodies to the spike surface protein and in particular to the receptor-binding domain on that protein. The most obvious platforms to develop single-dose vaccines are attenuated viruses, DNA plasmids, and messenger RNA constructs coding for viral proteins that stimulate neutralizing antibodies. However, subunit protein vaccines are also being developed. The appearance of SARS-CoV-2 emphasizes that new agents will emerge from time to time to threaten humans and that mechanisms of rapid response should be in place beforehand. That was the reason CEPI was developed and, indeed, CEPI and the WHO together are marshaling large-scale preventive and therapeutic responses to the new virus [22\u201325].",
