Infection could also occur when virions released by an infected person are spread on\ntheir hands and clothing and then transferred to others through close contact, such as\nhandshaking. Fomites infection6 is indirect and rather stealthy; it\noccurs only if a person first picks up the virions from contaminated objects and surfaces\n(e.g., by their hands) and then transfers them to his or her mouth, nose,\nor eyes. Throughout these processes, the virions need to endure a complex and dynamic set of\nenvironmental conditions outside the human body. Therefore, there are many opportunities to\nset up barriers using physical sciences and engineering (dashed lines in Figure 1) to block and to deactivate the overwhelming majority of\nreleased virions before they reach hosts and breach the final biological and immunological\ndefenses. Some examples include (a) isolating infectious patients and/or reducing the spread\nof their respiratory fluid droplets, (b) cleaning and sanitizing objects and surfaces, (c)\nfiltering potentially contaminated air, (d) washing hands frequently, (e) establishing\nbetter personal hygiene habits, and (f) wearing personal protection equipment (PPE).\nUnderstanding the basic structure of virions and their surroundings is required for\ndesigning inactivation and removal strategies and maximizing the effectiveness of these\nbarriers (Figure 1a\u2013f). All of these defense\nbarriers contribute to blocking the source of virions, breaking the spread pathways, and\nprotecting the susceptible hosts. Compared to other known infectious diseases caused by\ncoronaviruses, COVID-19 can spread through an additional stealth mode of asymptomatic\ntransmission,7\u22129 which dramatically\nincreases the difficulty of detecting, monitoring, and preventing its spread.",

For coronaviruses (Figure 2), such as\nthose that cause SARS, MERS, and COVID-19, the RNA is directly complexed with and protected\nby a helical protein shell to form a coiled nucleocapsid. It is then enveloped by a lipid\nbilayer membrane decorated with various other proteins, such as the protruding\n\u201ccorona\u201d spikes, which interact with the host cell. The biological function of\nviruses to preserve and, eventually, to deliver their nucleic acids to host cells depends on\nthe virus\u2019 structural integrity. For example, for enveloped viruses, their lipid\nbilayer must stay intact throughout the pathways to keep them infectious. The protein capsid\nmust be sufficiently strong to confine the elastically strained genomic coil and\nsufficiently tough to sustain osmotic pressure fluctuation in changing surroundings, yet\nthey must be able to disassemble readily inside the host cells to release the genomic core.\nThese constraints demand rather intricate protein building blocks that also must maintain\ndesirable configurations to avoid malfunction. The envelope and capsid, however, can be\ncompromised by an array of physical treatments, such as UV irradiation, heating, and\ndesiccation, as well as by chemical sanitization using acids, oxidants, alcohols, or some\nspecialized surfactants.10\u221212 Approaches like these may\nseem relatively primitive; however, they can be extremely effective in slowing down or even\npreventing virus spread and transmission.",

To this end, infected patients are required to\nwear medical masks, which can block and absorb large coughed droplets and reroute the\nsmaller ones to reduce their forward traveling distance.13,14 Masks are an important component in PPE (Figure 1, dashed line f) for frontline healthcare\nworkers. In the current COVID-19 pandemic, there has been much discussion about whether\nmasks are capable of blocking virus nanoparticles, which are typically around 100 nm in\ndiameter.15 However, this implies that virions released by an\ninfected person stay airborne as individual uncoated nanoparticles, which is rather\nmisleading. As shown in Figure 3, respiratory\nfluid droplets contain a variety of other components, typically of a few weight\npercent,16,17\nincluding insoluble particulates such as proteins, enzymes, commensal microflora\n(i.e., bacteria) colonized in the upper respiratory tract, and cell\ndebris from the respiratory tract lining; amphiphilic liposomal matter such as lung\nsurfactants and cholesterol; and soluble molecular species such as salt and lactate.\nTherefore, in the flying droplets or the final dried nuclei, virions are always surrounded\nby these materials and are usually a minority component, the loading of which varies by\nthe conditions of the patients.",

            "text": "The pictorial representation in Figure 3 reminds\nus that when designing physical and chemical approaches to deactivate virions, their\nsurrounding respiratory mass must be factored in. These noninfectious components may act\nas a protective matrix for the virions, rendering sanitization treatments ineffective, or\nthey can be manipulated for accelerated inactivation. For example, it has been reported\nthat both SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 virions can remain infectious for days on smooth\nsurfaces such as glass, plastics, and stainless steel, whereas they remain infectious for\njust hours on porous surfaces such as textile and paper materials.18,19 This observation is somewhat\nsurprising and worrisome, especially because stainless steel is ubiquitous for making\nmedical supplies and equipment, as well as most engineering structures and appliances.\nHowever, to the best of our knowledge, the effect of surface porosity is not\nwell-understood. One hypothesis is that nuclei particles are more likely to pick up\nmoisture from the air through capillary condensation on smooth surfaces than on porous\nones.20,21 The\nwater-soluble, hygroscopic components in the nuclei can hold condensed water to protect\nembedded virions from desiccation. On porous surfaces, condensed water can be drained away\nfrom the nuclei to equilibrate with the rest of the surface, leading to faster water loss\naround the virions. Desiccation is effective for deactivating enveloped virions because\nthe assembly of the membrane bilayer relies on water.22,23 Moreover, capillary compression24 can also mechanically squeeze the mixture in the drying droplets and\npotentially deform and damage the virion particles inside.",
