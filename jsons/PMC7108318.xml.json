The use of corticosteroid therapy to reduce possible immune-mediated pulmonary damage remains controversial (Oba, 2003). We previously described a real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) plasma/serum assay for early diagnosis of SARS (Ng et al., 2003). In this study, we analyzed serial plasma SARS-CoV RNA concentrations measured in the setting of a randomized, placebo-controlled trial initially designed to assess the efficacy of \u201cearly\u201d hydrocortisone use (initiated <7 days from fever onset) in previously healthy SARS patients. Effect of corticosteroid treatment on plasma viral load was studied by comparing hydrocortisone-treated patients versus those who received placebo.",

Since ribavirin has no demonstrable antiviral activity against SARS-CoV (Cyranoski, 2003), host immune defense is likely to be responsible for viral clearance. As shown in our study, \u201cearly\u201d initiation of corticosteroid treatment during the viral replication phase (Peiris et al., 2003b, Wong and Hui, 2003) in the first week of illness resulted in delayed viral clearance (thus a higher subsequent plasma viral load), which possibly related to its immunosuppressive effect.

            "text": "The use of corticosteroid therapy in SARS patients is controversial (Oba, 2003). Its immunosuppressive effect (SARS is a viral induced pneumonia), potential side effects (e.g. superimposed bacterial/fungal infections, hyperglycemia, electrolyte imbalance, psychosis), and lack of evidence on clinical efficacy from randomized/placebo-controlled studies were the main concerns (Wang et al., 2003, Peiris et al., 2003a). Corticosteroid was given to reduce possible immuno-pathological damage. Preliminary data from retrospective, non-randomized studies did demonstrate some clinical benefits in SARS patients receiving corticosteroid treatment (Sung et al., 2004, Ho et al., 2003). However, the optimal timing and dosage of such therapy is uncertain. Results from our analysis do not support the use of corticosteroid therapy early in the illness because of delayed viral clearance, especially when no concomitant effective antiviral therapy is given. In fact, as shown in a separate study, \u201cearly\u201d low-dose corticosteroid/hydrocortisone therapy failed to halt disease progression in >80% of cases (Sung et al., 2004). Although we did not observe abrupt rebound of viraemia in our cohort after \u201cpulse\u201d methylprednisolone therapy given after the first week, further study is needed to clarify the issue. Meanwhile we call for cautious use of such therapy; and if used, preferably given in later course of the disease, when an overexuberant host immune response is causing pathological lung damage (e.g. in the second week following clinical deterioration) (Peiris et al., 2003b, Loutfy et al., 2003, Wong and Hui, 2003), and when SARS-CoV viral load had declined significantly.",

In this study, we verify that a significantly higher plasma viral load was present in patients ever had SARS-CoV detected in their upper respiratory specimens by the qualitative RT-PCR method (likely resulting from a higher concomitant viral load in the upper respiratory secretions). In fact, a positive qualitative RT-PCR assay or a high viral load in upper respiratory secretions, and a high plasma viral load on admission were all predictive of adverse clinical outcomes (Tsang et al., 2003, Cheng et al., 2004, Ng et al., 2003). The lack of significant correlation between plasma viral load and fecal specimen RT-PCR positivity, the radiographic extent of lung infiltrate and the degree of lymphopenia may actually reflect the complexity of pathogenic mechanisms of SARS (e.g. immune-mediated pulmonary tissue damage, lymphocyte apoptosis versus direct viral lytic action) and require further study (Cheng et al., 2004, Peiris et al., 2003a, Wong and Hui, 2003, O\u2019Donnell et al., 2003).",
