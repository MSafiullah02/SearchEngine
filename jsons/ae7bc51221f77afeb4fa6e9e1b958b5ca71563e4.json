            "text": "The worst outbreak of desert locusts in decades is currently underway in East Africa. It will cause further deprivation for 14m people in the region already considered \"severely food insecure,\" United Nations (UN) specialists warned on February 10th. UN Food and Agricultural Organisation (FAO) official Keith Cressman describing locusts as \"the most dangerous migratory pest in the world,\" adding that they had recently entered Tanzania and Uganda and were expected to arrive soon in South Sudan, where another several million people face hunger as the country struggles to emerge from civil war. Eritrea and Djibouti are also at risk \"These countries are trying to do their best, but their capacities are overwhelmed,\" said FAO director of emergencies Dominique Burgeon. Al-Shabaab's control of some locust breeding grounds in Somalia is said to have made aerial spraying there virtually impossible. Somalia declared a state of emergency as unusually large swarms of the hungry insects gorged on crops. Burgeon said, however, that the UN would strive to carry out locust-control efforts in all infested areas. \"We are committed to negotiating access wherever possible,\" he told reporters at UN headquarters.",

            "text": "FAO is providing forecasts, early warning and alerts on the timing, scale and location of invasions and breeding. The speed of the pest's spread and the size of the infestations are so far beyond the norm that they have stretched the capacities of local and national authorities to the limit. Given the scale of the current swarms, aerial control is the only effective means to reduce the locust numbers. Aerial operations need to be upscaled substantially and very quickly in Ethiopia and Kenya. In addition, \"alongside pest control activities our response must include efforts to restore people's livelihoods,\" said FAO's Director-General. Ethiopia's Ministry of Agriculture said efforts were underway to prevent the spread of the outbreak. According to Sani Redi, state minister of agriculture, further swarms are spreading to the southern, south-western and south-eastern parts of the country. Data from the Ministry of Agriculture show that between three and five swarms of locusts, each with a population of 40-80m, crosses into Ethiopia every day from neighbouring countries. The invasion could last until June in Ethiopia, Redi said. \"There are 13m people in the affected countries who are severely food insecure now,\" said Mark Lowcock during a UN press conference. \"Ten million of those people are in the places affected by locusts.\" Lowcock, who said he had recently released $10m for the crisis, warned that \"unless there was a rapid response, we are going to have a huge problem later in the year.\" According to Lowcock, the FAO estimated at the end of January that a locust control plan would cost $76m. \"What we have so far is just $20m,\" he said. Lowcock said the locust outbreak was \"the worst for 70 years in Kenya, for 25 years in Ethiopia, Somalia,\" and that one of the reasons behind the swarms was climate change. An increased number of cyclones in the Indian Ocean has provided more pasturage in the Arabian Peninsula and the Horn for locusts to eat and consequently breed in record numbers, he explained. The FAO says the current invasion is known as an \"upsurge\"when an entire region is affectedhowever, if it gets worse and cannot be contained, over a year or more, it would become what is known as a \"plague\" of locusts. There have been six major desert locust plagues in the 1900s, the last of which was in 1987-89. The last major upsurge was in 2003-05. The window to contain the crisis is closing fast. In March the rain and planting season begins. The swarms are highly mobile; the terrain often difficult; the logistical challenges immense. But left uncheckedand with expected additional rainslocust numbers in East Africa could increase 500 times by June. The massive swarms entered Kenya in December and have torn through pastureland in the north and centre of the country. The Agriculture Ministry said it would take at least six months to control the locusts, highlighting a threat to food security as Kenya's breadbasket regions prepare for the main crop season starting in March. Agriculture Cabinet Secretary Peter Munya also cited a lack of an effective chemical in the local market, adding that the fight against the insect has been slowed down by long procurement and import bureaucracies. Munya said the situation had been worsened by the lapses in handling the locust threat when they were first spotted in northern Kenya. The Treasury has termed the invasion by desert locusts as a \"systemic risk\" that might prevent the Kenyan economy from attaining its medium-term growth target of 7%. However, some economists have played down the threat, saying it poses minimal impact on growth.",

On foreign tours, Lourenc \u00dfo argues that prosecuting crooked politicians and their families should boost investment and pave the way for privatisation. But Luanda insiders doubt whether the modest reforms and forcing MPLA kleptocrats to return some stolen funds, on which the administration has expended much effort, will woo heavyweight foreign investors. Angola is seen as complicated, opaque and expensive. \"They haven't realised yet that people simply aren't interested in Angola. . . Nobody serious is coming in. There are plenty of other places to go in Africa,\" one Western banker said. This will slow the plans to privatise on an epic scale and disband the old patronage system. Even Angolan oligarchs may be deterred, fearing the limelight could make them targets of the clampdown on corruption. While the allegations count in the tens of millions, rough estimates of the amounts taken abroad by the entire dos Santos clan touch $10bn, about a tenth of the total missing.

To strengthen the social contract, the state must undertake to improve the efficiency and quality of goods and social services, while restoring the trust of taxpayers to encourage them to move out of the informal sector and pay their taxes. ii) Broaden the tax base: CAR's tax revenue currently accounts for approximately 8% of GDP, which is below its potential and among the lowest in Sub-Saharan Africa. CAR could consider increasing the tax rates on alcohol and tobacco products in the short term and reducing the number of tax brackets that hinder business creation and development in the long term. iii) Improve property tax collection: Legislation on property taxation has not been updated to reflect recent economic developments. Current revenue collection is inefficient and is based on a declarative system that narrows the tax base. New legislation could generate close to CFA francs 12bn (roughly US$22m). iv) Limit tax exemptions: In 2016, tax exemptions were a major source of lost tax revenue for the country (almost CFAF 2.4bn or roughly $4m). A significant share of these exemptions was granted to the private sector and related primarily to VAT. The adoption of the new investment charter in 2017 and the implementation of reforms aimed at curbing tax exemptions and improving the business environment to attract private investment require the firm commitment of the authorities and a formal legal system to institute legal proceedings in the event of abuse. v) Modernise the tax system: Strengthening tax administration capacity is critical to improving the tax system. This requires heavy investment in the computerisation of public administrations and the purchase of the equipment and software needed to improve revenue collection. Computerisation will help curb abuse and corruption, trace transactions related to taxes and duties, facilitate the sharing of information between tax and customs authorities, and enhance the efficiency of financial boards.",

Having put much of the past economic volatility behind, the challenge for Mozambique remains to be slow growth. According to the Mozambique Economic Update (MEU), growth is expected to have fallen to 2.3% in 2019, from 3.3% in 2018, as lower coal production and the impact of the cyclones, particularly on agriculture, affected overall output. With economic output growing at a slower pace than the population (2.8%), this translates into a decline in the standards of living in a context where poverty has been further aggravated by the cyclones. The report also warns that Mozambique is entering a period of widening current account deficits as it heads towards the early stages of the Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) investment cycle. It enters this cycle with an improved external reserve position. But lacklustre non-extractive export performance, lower growth in key trading partners and commodity price movements continue to be important sources of external risk. The MEU presents a positive growth outlook provided a post-cyclone recovery in agriculture, easing in credit conditions and progress in LNG developments are materialised. But the report highlights the need for a renewed focus on structural reforms for more sustainable and inclusive growth, including progress in strengthening the business environment, increasing the supply of skilled labour to the economy, reducing corruption and improving connectivity. Building resilience to climate shocks is also increasingly critical given Mozambique's heightened exposure to such events.",

Thus, the outlook points to a tight fiscal setting and requires near term measures to reduce the deficit whilst maintaining a persistent focus on improving expenditure efficiency.

Sudan faces a series of challenges driven by an economic crisis; years of recession were a key trigger for the protest movement against Omar al-Bashir's 30-yearold autocratic regime. The economy remains burdened with foreign debt of more than $60bn, inflation of about 60%, soaring unemployment and chronic shortage of fuel and foreign currency. But these challenges are A B C exactly the opportunity for the international community to step in and help Sudan, said United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) administrator Achim Steiner. \"Here is a country in which the youth, and particularly the women, have not only managed to pull off a peaceful revolution in large part, but they actually have an agenda to build a developmental state,\" Steiner said. Sudanese officials say there has been a lacklustre response from the international community to the country's reform process led by new prime minister Abdalla Hamdok. Most blame Washington's continued blacklisting of Sudan as a \"state sponsor of terrorism\", which makes international banking cumbersome and keeps overseas investors away. \"We are in danger of forgetting that Sudan. . . is actually a story that is more hopeful than it has been for 30 years.",

The project will be implemented in Africa's transitional countries from 2020 to 2022. The FIMES project will train policymakers responsible for the extractive sector to realise greater returns from natural resource investments in their countries. The bank's African Natural Resources Centre (ANRC) will implement the pilot project in the eight beneficiary countries, namely Guinea, Liberia, Niger, Mali, Madagascar, South Sudan, Sierra Leone and Zimbabwe. \"Africa's transitional countries need to build state capacity to mobilise revenues from natural resource investments, to address reconstruction, infrastructure and socio-economic priorities. The FIMES project will equip transitional countries with the right skills and knowledge to enhance domestic resource mobilisation for accelerated growth and sustainable development,\" said Vanessa Ushie, Manager of the Policy Analysis Division in the African Natural Resources Centre. \"Given the strategic importance of natural resource revenues for building peace, stability, and resilience in transitional settings, the project is timely for the Bank and the beneficiary countries,\" she added.

The 2019 maize harvest was roughly half of the previous year's it said. The World Food Programme (WFP), which expects to assist more than four million Zimbabweans in 2020, is predicting another dismal harvest in April. Zimbabwe's farmers are grappling with a legacy of colonial-era laws, compounded by national and local taxes that have been levied since the country declared independence from the United Kingdom in 1980, reported Al Jazeera (24/1). \"Farmers just have too many taxes imposed on them,\" said Edward Dune, chief executive of the Zimbabwe National Farmers Union (ZNFU). \"There is the rural development tax which is paid to the local government authorities, the tobacco levy on the tobacco farmer and the livestock levy,\" he told Al Jazeera. There is also a 10% withholding tax on produce. The experience of tobacco farmers lays bare just how onerous the tax burden has become. Tobacco is among the country's most valuable export commodities, earning $933m in 2016. But those who choose to farm the crop must run a gauntlet of taxes that erode their already slim profit margins. There is 0.75% government tax on all tobacco delivered to auction, and a 0.8% levy charged by the Tobacco Industry and Marketing Board for the gross value of tobacco sold at the auction. The Ministry of Agriculture also deducts $0.875 per kilogramme from the gross value of tobacco sold at the auction.",

The theme of the event was Optimising Growth and Investment in the Digitised Economy. Discussions were also planned on the \"industry's role in addressing climate change and decarbonisation and sustainability measures\". South Africa's minister of mineral resources and energy, Gwede Mantashe, who opened this, the 26th edition of the Indaba, used the opportunity to address another topical issue in the mining space, namely the self-generation of power by mining companies. He said that government recognised that private power, particularly for self-generation, was essential to close the energy gap and would now allow mining companies to set up their own projects. He also spoke of a potential government move to establish a new state-owned energy utility to 'back-up' Eskom. He added that government was committed to working with investors to enhance both policy and regulatory certainty.

REPP has been supporting the project with development capital since December, 2016, and has now committed to provide a construction bridge loan. The balance of the funding will be provided by a matching construction bridge loan and equity investment from Evolution II Fund, managed by Inspired Evolution Investment Management, and further equity funding by the project developer and co-sponsor, Gigawatt Global Co\u20ac operatief. Geoff Sinclair, Managing Director of Camco Clean Energy, which manages REPP, said: \"Today's announcement is a landmark moment for Burundi's energy sectoronce built the solar plant will add nearly 15% to the generation capacity of its grid using clean energy. \"With REPP's support, the Mubuga project will have a substantial positive impact on the country and is a clear demonstration of the important role that the private sector has to play in boosting Africa's electricity supply with affordable renewable energy.\" It is estimated that the plant, which follows Gigawatt Global's first project in Rwanda, will be able to supply the electricity needs of around 87,600 people and businesses, and provide 300 parttime jobs during construction and support up to 50 permanent jobs during the operational phase.

There are currently more than 10 oil blocks under exploration in Angola. The auction programme comes at a time when oil production is in decline with an average of 1.4m barrels produced every day, making Angola the second-largest oil producer in sub-Saharan Africa, behind Nigeria, which produces 1.7m barrels per day. Angola exported 478.9m barrels of oil in 2019, a fall of 10.8% compared to 536.9m recorded in 2018, according to statistics released by the Ministry of Mineral Resources and Oil.

A gold rush has gripped northern Mauritania since 2016, when the government allowed citizens to dig for the precious metal; thousands of them flocked to the region, not only from Mauritania but also from neighbouring countries.

Under the terms of the partnership, the government will acquire a shareholding of 16% in each of the mines and will receive its half of the economic benefits through taxes, royalties, clearing fees and participation in all cash distribution made by the mines and Twiga. He urged Twiga Minerals to work closely with communities around the mining zones and support them with education, health, water and other areas. Further, he reminded them on environment protection for sustainable development.The dispute originally involved Acacia Mining, which was bought out by Barrick in 2019 in a $1.2bn transaction. The government's ban on the export of mineral concentrates occurred in early 2017, when it accused Acacia of tax evasion.
