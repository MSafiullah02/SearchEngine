Most neurons are formed by the end of the second trimester, but only limited dendritic connections are present. These proliferate during the third trimester in all areas of the brain but especially in the auditory cortex, where learning of phonemes and voice inflection is already taking place.3, 4 The fetus is primed to receive multisensory input from the mother\u2014smell, taste, tactile, pain, movement, temperature change, light, and auditory input are all detected and elicit a response in the fetus, and in the preterm infant as well. In the open ward setting, even when the baby is in an incubator, many of these sensory stimuli are different in character, timing, and context than they are in utero. To some extent this is unavoidable, but the presence of the infant in an open ward, where shielding from activity in the adjacent bed space with its attendant noise and lights is incomplete at best, is now understood to be less than optimal from a developmental standpoint.",

Although it is possible to facilitate skin-to-skin care in an open ward, both space and privacy issues limit many parents from taking full advantage of this technique. SFR designs have been shown to enhance parental interaction with the baby5 and caregivers.6 It is not difficult to imagine how uncomfortable some parents (especially fathers) might be to sing a lullaby, read a children's story, or discuss sensitive matters with the medical staff in an open ward, or how much more likely this would be to occur in the SFR setting. Evidence for the value of skin-to-skin care in particular is now growing rapidly,7, 8, 9 and it is also intuitive to understand how much more suitable the mother's arms would be than the incubator or warming bed with regard to all the desired sensory stimuli.10\n",

Hospital-acquired infections remain a major cause of death, disability, and cost in premature babies. The initial all-private room NICU was constructed in the 1980s in Brest, France, for infection control purposes and recent pandemics of severe acute respiratory syndrome and influenza, as well as local outbreaks of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and multiple-resistant Gram-negative bacteria, have emphasized the importance of considering this an important issue in NICU design. Hospital-acquired infection has been reduced in the adult setting through the use of private rooms,11 and since it is now clear that the incubator is an insufficient barrier to acquisition of nosocomial organisms, the SFR is an attractive way to address this problem.",

Clinical experience has shown that families feel more welcome in the SFR setting, and they perceive that their babies receive better care.

In these areas, lighting (especially daylight and access to nature), sound (eg, conversation, music), and other stimuli that would not be appropriate at the bedside can be allowed and even encouraged to the extent that it improves the well-being and performance of caregivers.

Monitor information can now be sent from a baby's bedside to a monitor at any other bedside, to a central monitor, as well as to a wireless communication device carried by caregivers. These devices can be programmed to also send monitor information to other caregivers in the NICU if the primary caregiver is unable to immediately respond. Currently, though, most medical devices cannot be networked with the monitor alarms, so an \u201cinfusion complete\u201d or \u201cocclusion\u201d alarm from an IV pump, or alarms of similar importance from ventilators and incubators are readily transmitted only by auditory means.

One approach utilized successfully in many adult, child, and neonatal units is to separate the direct care planning and teaching functions, holding the latter rounds away from the bedside.

Several problems remain, though, that require careful planning. Because of the need to hear non-networked alarms, rooms should be designed so that this sound can be transmitted to the central nursing area when the SFR door is open without other barriers or competing noise that could interfere with the ability of the nurse to hear the alarm. In some situations, though, (e.g., an infant in an open crib or skin-to-skin without medical devices, hospice care, or 1:1 nursing), closing the door could be acceptable and even desirable. The \u201cnurse call\u201d button should be easily accessible both to parents who may be holding the baby at the bedside and to caregivers at any point of care; this might require two such buttons in some settings.",

Anticipating the need for policies that support family involvement and collaborative nursing care then, becomes part of the planning for SFR design and can even benefit from some level of implementation long before the new NICU is built. For example, the elements of collaborative nursing as currently practiced should be reviewed, compared with a vision of what would be optimal, and then steps taken to move in that direction. If caregivers typically help one another during an IV start, when weighing an infant, or when performing respiratory care, how can that teamwork be formalized in a way that provides the least stress for the infant, and the greatest efficiency for the staff? Is there a role for families to help in such cases? If responding quickly to saturation alarms is important to limit complications of oxygen toxicity or deprivation, how can caregivers best assist one another, and empower parents to become a part of the care team in this regard? Further consideration of these topics is beyond the scope of this paper but presents fertile ground for future discussion and clinical research.",

            "text": "Clear evidence that SFR design improves the outcomes for babies is still lacking. Surveys done in SFR units show that the great majority of families prefer the SFR and that most nurses believe it is the best environment of care for the infant.16 A comprehensive study is underway at Women & Infants Hospital of Rhode Island to evaluate the long-term impact on infants cared for in an SFR compared to those treated in an open ward. In the meantime, the best evidence currently available comes from Sweden, where a randomized controlled trial of 365 families showed that preterm infants cared for in a setting where the family was present and providing skin-to-skin care on an almost continuous basis required approximately 5 days less of intensive care, on average, and were discharged home 5 days earlier than those who were cared for in an area where parents were welcome at all times but their overnight stay was quite limited. Skin-to-skin care was instituted in both groups but particularly facilitated in the group that had continuous access for the parents.17 This group is planning to obtain long-term follow-up of these infants, but even the short-term data would indicate that significant cost-savings can be derived by designing and operating a NICU where the environment of the baby and parents is more nurturing than the open ward design would allow. This may be an important step to the era where parents are accepted as full partners in the medical team.",
