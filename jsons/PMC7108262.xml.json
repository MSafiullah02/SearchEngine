C. parvum is strongly associated with diarrhea in neonatal calves [1]. A report mentioned that the prevalence of this parasite reached 75% in pre-weaned calves in Japan [2]. Diarrhea is a complex and multifactorial disease symptom influenced by the nutritional and immunological status of a calf, the management of the herd, the environment, and various infectious agents [3]. Co-infection with multiple pathogens may increase diarrhea severity and mortality rates. In addition to C. parvum, rotavirus, bovine coronavirus and enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (E. coli K99) are well-known enteropathogens associated with neonatal diarrhea in calves throughout the world [4], [5], [6]. However, investigations to identify the multiple causative agents of diarrhea in calves have not been performed yet in Japan. Therefore, one of the aims of the present study was to determine the prevalence of the four major causative agents associated with clinical diarrheal cases in pre-weaned calves through use of commercial immunochromatography test (ICT) strips.",

            "text": "Traditionally, C. parvum has been diagnosed by microscopy of fecal samples following sample concentration by the sugar floatation method. However, C. parvum cannot be differentiated from C. bovis and C. ryanae using microscopy because their oocysts are of similar size and morphology [7]. C. bovis and C. ryanae have been detected exclusively from cattle, and infections with the two species are most likely asymptomatic [8]. It is therefore important to accurately distinguish those species from C. parvum. Recently, the nucleotide sequences obtained from nested polymerase chain reactions (PCRs) of the small subunit ribosomal RNA (SSUrRNA) and glycoprotein 60 (GP60) genes have been employed as tools for accurate species identification and subtyping analysis, respectively [9], [10], [11], [12], [13]. Although some epidemiological studies on C. parvum in Japan have been performed using these DNA markers [14], [15], [16], [17], they did not characterize the C. parvum populations from more than one region of the country. Therefore, the aim of the present study was not only to obtain epidemiological information about C. parvum based on SSUrRNA and GP60 gene sequences, but also to compare the characteristics of this parasite in two different Japanese prefectures, southernmost Okinawa and northernmost Hokkaido.",

One to seven samples were collected from each farm and the fecal properties of the samples were recorded. Commercial ICT strips (Bio-X Diagnostics SPRL, Jemelle, Belgium) were used to detect C. parvum, rotavirus, coronavirus, and E. coli K99 antigens in the diarrhea samples (Table 1\n). Twenty-five diarrheic samples were also collected from calves aged from 4 to 21 days in Hokkaido prefecture, Japan, from December 2012 to May 2013. One to five samples were collected from 11 farms (Table 2\n). These samples tested positive for C. parvum antigen using ICT strips, and molecular characterizations were performed to compare those with C. parvum from Okinawa prefecture. Rotavirus, coronavirus, and E. coli K99 were not investigated for the samples from Hokkaido prefecture. All the fecal samples were stored at 4 \u00b0C and transported to laboratories for further analyses.",

For the GP60 gene, gp60 nested 1st F (5\u2032-ATG CAA AAA TAC GTG GAC TGG GT-3\u2032) and gp60 nested 1st R (5\u2032-TCG CAC GAA AGA TTT CCA TTG-3\u2032) primers were used for the first round of PCR, followed by gp60 nested 2nd orfF (5\u2032-ATG AGA TTG TCG CTC ATT ATC GTA T-3\u2032) and gp60 nested 2nd orfR (5\u2032-TTA CAA CAC GAA TAA GGC TGC AAA G-3\u2032) primers for the second PCR round. Outer PCR was performed in a 25 \u03bcl volume with 2 \u03bcl of template DNA, 12.5 \u03bcl of 2 \u00d7 Gflex PCR buffer (TaKaRa, Shiga, Japan; Mg2 +, dNTP plus), 0.13 \u03bcl of each primer (10 \u03bcM), and 1.25 U of Tks Gflex DNA polymerase (TaKaRa) using the GeneAmp\u00ae PCR system 2700 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, USA). Thermal cycling consisted of an initial denaturation step at 94 \u00b0C for 1 min, followed by 35 cycles at 98 \u00b0C for 10 s, 55 \u00b0C for 15 s, and 68 \u00b0C for 30 s, with a final extension at 68 \u00b0C for 7 min. Inner PCRs were performed using the same conditions with 2 \u03bcl of the first PCR amplification mixture as the template after 10-fold dilution in double-distilled water. Inner PCR amplicons were purified with the NucleoSpin\u00ae Gel and PCR Clean-up Kit (MACHEREY-NAGEL, D\u00fcren, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions, followed by direct sequencing from both directions using a BigDye Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems). The resultant sequence ladders were determined using a 3500-Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems). The SSUrRNA nucleotide sequences were compared with C. parvum GenBank reference sequences for accurate species identification. A neighbor-joining phylogram inferred from the GP60 sequences was constructed by PAUP version 4.0b10 [18]. In the phylogram construction, the GP60 sequences obtained in this study along with the C. parvum reference sequences were used. Bootstrap analyses were conducted using 1000 replicates.",

Among the diarrhea samples from Okinawa, the C. parvum antigen showed the highest frequency (50%). A previous study performed in Hokkaido reported that the prevalence of C. parvum reached 75% in pre-weaned calves [2]. In contrast, the previously reported prevalence rates for rotavirus in Japan were 9.6% [19] and 5.2% [20]. Further investigations on diarrhea cases from different locations in Japan may reveal the major pathogens involved in calf diarrhea more clearly. The present study revealed that the diarrhea cases associated with C. parvum tended to have watery diarrhea (Table 3). Watery diarrhea causes severe dehydration in neonatal calves, which in turn may lead to a significant economic loss in cattle industry. Our study did not reveal any significant difference in the OPG values between single infections of C. parvum and mixed infections with another diarrhea-causing agent. However, the number of co-infections observed was insufficient to draw any conclusions about the effect that more than one pathogenic organism might have on the OPG values. Hence, continuous sampling from clinical cases of calf diarrhea is needed to obtain more accurate OPG calculations to evaluate whether any correlations between C. parvum oocyst numbers and the presence or absence of other pathogens exist.",

The SSUrRNA gene was probably amplified efficiently because it is a multicopy gene whereas GP60 is a single locus gene [21]. The ICT strip readily detected C. parvum antigen; however, our results suggest that there is a risk of misdiagnosis when this test strip alone is used to detect C. parvum. The GP60 nested PCR did not seem to always be effective at diagnosing C. parvum because we were unable to obtain amplicons from two of the Okinawa samples, despite them being C. parvum antigen- and oocyst-positive according to microscopic observations. Therefore, the results of this study suggest that it is better to use more than one method to reliably detect C. parvum.",

These findings suggest that C. parvum with the IIaA15G2R1 subtype is predominant in Japan.
