Several well-described clusters of infection were difficult to explain by these routes, including transmission to 22 persons on an aircraft [2] , to 13 guests sharing the same floor of a hotel [3] , and to 1300 persons in an apartment complex [4] .

These observations led some to speculate about the possible role of more-remote transmission, including airborne spread by small droplets or true aerosols and fomite spread after contact with environmental surfaces possibly contaminated with SARS coronavirus (SARS CoV) [2, 6] . Environmental contamination and fomite spread has been occasionally implicated in hospital transmission of other viruses, such as rotavirus, and bacteria, such as Enterobacter cloacae [7, 8] .
