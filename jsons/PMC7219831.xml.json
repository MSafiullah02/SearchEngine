This may be accomplished by the use of a conventional nasal cannula or a facemask. Commonly used oxygen-delivery devices are described in Table 1. Current guidelines in nonpregnant individuals suggest starting oxygen therapy with peripheral SpO2 levels below 92% and recommend its use when levels are below 90%.2 Based on physiologic changes in pregnancy (eg, increased oxygen demand and a physiologic increase in partial pressure of oxygen), we suggest starting oxygen therapy in pregnant patients when SpO2 values fall below 94%. Therapy should be titrated to avoid SpO2 levels above 96%.2 Once oxygen supplementation is initiated, obstetricians should involve personnel expert in airway management (eg, an anesthesiologist) in case endotracheal intubation is required later. Together with oxygen therapy, asking the patient to lay down in bed prone (awake self-prone position) appears to improve oxygenation (likely by anterior displacement of the mediastinum and improved posterior lung recruitment).3 The latter may be considered in pregnant patients at less than 20 weeks of gestation.",

In patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, a conservative fluid strategy, as opposed to liberal fluid administration, has been shown to reduce the number of days on mechanical ventilation and the number of days in the intensive care unit.4 Current guidelines suggest a conservative fluid strategy in patients with COVID-19 infection, aiming for a daily negative balance of 0.5\u20131 L.2 During pregnancy, the risk of pulmonary edema in the setting of lung inflammation may be increased secondary to increased blood volume and lower oncotic pressure. We recommend that maintenance fluids be avoided in pregnant patients with acute COVID-19 infection and oxygen desaturation (SpO2 less than 94%). If daily positive fluid balances are present combined with worsening respiratory status, the use of furosemide (10\u201320 mg intravenously every 12 hours) may be indicated.",

Once improvement is noted, the FiO2 should be weaned before the flow is decreased, because the flow provides alveolar recruitment (high flow of air results in 3\u20135 cmH2O of positive pressure ventilation, keeping more alveoli open). We recommend that, once the FiO2 is 0.4\u20130.5, the flow may be weaned gradually by decreases of 5\u201310 L/min every 4\u20136 hours as tolerated to maintain the SpO2 level above 94%.",
