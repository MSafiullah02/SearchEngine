Yet, university research and education have not followed suit. Clearly, services research and education deserve our critical attention and support since services -and services innovation -serve as an indispensable engine for global economic growth. The theme of this paper is that we can and should build services research and education on what has occurred in manufacturing research (especially in regard to customization and intellectual property) and education; indeed, services and manufactured goods become indistinguishable as they are jointly co-produced in real-time. Fortunately, inasmuch as manufacturing concepts, methodologies and technologies have been developed and refined over a long period of time (i.e., since the 1800s), the complementary set of concepts, methodologies and technologies for services are more obvious. However, while new technologies (e.g., the Internet) and globalization trends have served to enable, if not facilitate, services innovation, the same technologies (e.g., the Internet) and 21st Century realities (e.g., terrorism) are making services innovation a far more complex problem and, in fact, may be undermining previous innovations in both services and manufacturing. Finally, there is a need to define a \"knowledge-adjusted\" GDP metric that can more adequately measure the growing knowledge economy, one driven by intangible ideas and services innovation.",

Admittedly, eBay and Microsoft also protect their intellectual property by patents and copyrights, but there is disproportionately more intellectual property protection in manufacturing than in services -that is, much more than 20 percent of the patents issued are in the goods sector, or conversely, much less than 80 percent of the patents issued are in the services sector, which, as indicated in Table 1 , is now employing 82.1 percent of the U. S. workforce.",

            "text": "DSES) in regard to services research and education. More specifically, DSES' Center for Services Research and Education (CSRE)established in 1990 -has been responsible for our substantial activities in furthering services research and services education. Several factors have accounted for our progress in services research. First, the department, formally established in 1987, brought together faculty from science (in operations research), management (information systems and statistics) and engineering (industrial and systems engineering) -that is, from those disciplines that are coincidentally required for services research. Second, a majority of the DSES faculty has always had a research interest in services, especially public (including transportation and infrastructure) and financial services. Third and as detailed in Section 2, we have advanced services research by exploiting similarities, complementarities and differences between services and manufacturing and, then, by building on the extensive research in manufacturing.

Home shoring also provides a flexible, just-in-time workforce whose performance can nevertheless still be monitored with the assistance of software agents and recording devices. While flexibility and control are the primary reasons for workers to accept home shoring assignments, the lack of fringe benefits may forestall future growth in this trend. Interestingly, the outsourcing of work to foreign, offshore companies is now being transformed to only an off shoring situation as U. S. companies gain control or invest in these foreign companies, eventually maybe even taking them over and making them wholly owned subsidiaries.

More specifically and in contrast to a manufactured product, services are based on intellectual property that is rarely protected by any patents belonging to the service provider.Usually the service provider uses physical technologies or products that belong to outside suppliers who protect their intellectual property by patents. However, the use of the intellectual property, either by product purchase or by license, is available non-exclusively to all competing service providers. Examples abound: the airline industry uses jet airplanes, which technology is protected by patents owned by the aircraft manufacturers and other suppliers; Wal-Mart, as part of its vaunted supply chain leadership, relies on point-of-sales cash registers developed and sold by IBM, which holds the intellectual property for those devices; and Citibank, the leader in employing the automated teller machine (ATM) innovation, does not hold the ATM-related patents -Diebold does. Rather than the service processes being protected by intellectual property owned by the service provider itself, the service businesses often obtain competitive advantages in a different manner and by employing intangible assets. As examples, they use branding (e.g., Starbucks) to differentiate themselves from competitors; they use high switching costs (e.g., Microsoft) to make it difficult for customers to go over to other vendors; and they use supply chain cost advantages (e.g., Wal-Mart) or other organizational strengths. Another approach to creating competitive advantages or service value, not necessarily derived from intellectualproperty, is to utilize network externalities (e.g., eBay) for increasing the number of users.",

Trade secret protection may apply to unpublished works and the basic software instructions called source code. A person who works on developing a software considered to be a trade secret is required to sign a nondisclosure agreement; it is a contract that obligates the person signing it to keep the project a secret.Once software is developed and is ready to be sold, it can be copyrighted. Copyright protects the expression of an idea, not the idea itself.For example, a person could not copyright the idea of a computer database management system but could copyright the structure and content of a database software program that expresses the idea of a database system. Quattro spreadsheet program. The court of appeals ruled that Borland had not infringed on Lotus's copyright because the menu's command hierarchy was a \"method of operation,\" which is not copyrightable under Federal copyright law (17 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 102(b)). Patent law provides another means of protecting software. A patent protects the idea itself. It is, however, a difficult venue because it takes a significant amount of both time (usually two years) and money to obtain a patent from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). The patent process is complicated and technical, with the applicant required to prove that a patent is deserved. Because the shelf life of a software program is often short, seeking a patent for the program is often impractical. Trademark law, on the other hand, protects the name of the software, not the software itself. Actually, protecting a name from being used by others can be more valuable than other forms of protection.When software is leased or sold, the purchaser usually must agree to accept a software license, which details how the software is to be used and limits its distribution. A software license is an effective tool in preventing piracy. When consumers buy software from a software company or through a third-party business, they find in the packaging a software license. The license is typically on the sealed envelope that contains the software media, which itself is in a plastic wrapping. These\"shrink-wrap licenses\" describe contractual conditions regarding the purchaser's use of the software, and the opening of the shrink-wrap, according to the license, constitutes acceptance of all of the terms contained in the license agreement. The purchaser is informed that the software is licensed and not sold to the purchaser. By retaining title to the software, the software owner imposes conditions on the purchaser, or licensee, that are not otherwise permissible under Federal copyright law. The principal terms of the shrink-wrap license include prohibiting the unauthorized copying and renting of the software, prohibiting reverse engineering (i.e., figuring out how the software works) and modifications of the software, limiting the use of the software to one computer, disclaiming warranties, and limiting liabilities. The enforceability of shrink-wrap licenses has nevertheless been challenged in the courts. The prevailing view is that when mass-market prepackaged software is sold, the transaction is a sale of goods and not a true license agreement. The key issue is whether the license document is part of an enforceable contract. Defenders of shrink-wrap licenses argue that the purchaser agrees to the conditions of the license after breaking the packaging seal and therefore contract law must uphold the written terms of the contract. Opponents argue that the sequence of events in the typical software purchase transaction is skewed. The purchaser is not aware of the license agreement until after the sale is consummated. The purchaser's acceptance of the license agreement is inferred when he or she opens the package or uses the software. However, the purchaser does not sign the license agreement and may not even read the terms of the license agreement. Obviously, software developers have legitimate concerns about software piracy. For example, piracy and counterfeiting account for billions of dollars in lost software sales each year in China alone. The Software Publishers Association (SPA) and the Business Software Alliance (BSA) are key organizations that combat software piracy. The SPA is the leading international trade association for the personal computer software industry. Both SPA and BSA have collected millions of dollars worldwide from companies that have used pirated software. Most companies with pirated software are usually reported by former -and most likely disgruntled -employees. In sum, the inability to appropriately safeguard the intellectual property of services remains a major obstacle to services innovation, especially as compared to manufacturing innovation. Another approach to protecting the intellectual property of services is through business method patents. However, although there has been a growth of such patents granted by the USPTO, the Japan Patent Office (JPO) and the European Patent Office (EPO), the annual total number is still only in the hundreds and account for much less than one percent of all patents",

Corrado et al. (2005) are concerned that while the government's decades-old system of data collection and statistical analysis are appropriate for capturing tangible investments in equipment, buildings and even software, they are inadequate in reflecting the growing knowledge economy, one driven by intangible ideas and innovation. In other words, the Bureau of Economic Analysis in Washington, D. C., is not tracking the billions of dollars that companies spend each year on innovation and product design, brand-building, employee training, or any of the other investments -not consumption costs -that are required to compete in today's global economy. As a result, services-oriented economies -like those of the U. S. and Japan -are probably much stronger than the official statistics indicate. Such an innovation in economic measurements may result in a \"knowledge-adjusted\" GDP metric which could, in turn, provide a greater motivation for focusing on services research and education.",

            "text": "While the COPP partitioning of the value chain has been recognized in the literature, its management and relationship to various production schemas is novel. In a make-to-stock (MTS) environment (where the COPP is at the retailer), the supply -and its chain -is somewhat given or fixed, while the demand chain can be managed (e.g., through discounting, advertising, etc.); that is, the supply chain is driven by material supply and all the products are finished before the customer order is received. The MTS supply chain is based on the principles of mass production, mass distribution and mass marketing; consequently, MTS allows for very limited product customization. In an assemble-to-order (ATO) environment (where the COPP is at the assembler), the demand -and its chain -is somewhat given or fixed, while the supply chain can be managed (e.g., through lean or just-in-time manufacturing); that is, thedemand chain is driven by the arrival of a customer order, after which stocked components are assembled into a finished product. The ATO supply chain can thus be managed to allow for more customization; as examples, in addition to computer assemblers like Dell and Gateway, Nike offers a program called NikeiD that allows customers to choose the color, material, cushioning, and other attributes of their athletic shoe order, and Procter & Gamble allows women to create and order custom personal-care products such as cosmetics, fragrances, and shampoos. In a make-to-order (MTO) environment (where the COPP is at the manufacturer), the demand -and its chain -is somewhat given or fixed, while the supply chain can be managed (e.g., design-to-order); it is, like the ATO case, driven by the arrival of a customer order but, unlike the ATO case, all the components are made -and assembled -after the order arrives. The MTO supply chain can thus be totally managed to allow for full customization; however, as indicated earlier, except for special, one-time orders, neither mass customization nor real-time mass customization is a reality at this time. Nevertheless, more advanced customization environments are being planned, although their customization capability is neither massive nor timely at this time. Customization of clothing, car seats, and other body-fitted products is being advanced through laser-based, 3-D body scanners that not only capture a \"point cloud\" of the targeted body surface (e.g., some 150,000 points are required to create a digital skin of the entire body) but also the software algorithms that integrate the points and extract the needed size measurements. For example, European shoe makers recently initiated a project called EUROShoE (www.euro-shoe.net), in which an individual's feet are laser scanned and the data are forwarded to a CAD/CAM computer that controls the manufacturing process. Likewise, electronics giant Toshiba wants to give Web surfers and walk-in customers new tools to view digital versions of themselves trying on clothes, accessories and make-up, and Paccar custom-builds large rigs or trucks to individual specifications. We can, of course, expect to see more and more applications of this kind in the future; they will serve to close the gap between products and services. Further, the upstream components of a demand chain (i.e., up to the COPP) are sometimes eliminated for cost reduction reasons; thus, for an ATO case, the \"retailer\" may be unnecessary in the demand chain, and for an MTO case, both the \"retailer\" and \"assembler\" may be unnecessary. Not surprisingly and depending on where the COPP is located, different levels of customization can be defined. More specifically, when the COPP is at the customer, Pine and Gilmore (1997) call it adaptive customization, while Tien et al. (2004) call it mass production;",

Unfortunately, despite the tremendous growth of the services sector in the U.S. economy, the attention paid to services research and education by institutions of higher learning has been minimal. There are, of course, some Fishman-Davidson Center for the Study of the Service Sector (established in 1984 at the University of Pennsylvania), the Center for Services Leadership (established in 1985 at Arizona State University), the Center for Services Research and Education (established in 1990 at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute), and the Center for Excellence in Service (established in 2000 at the University of Maryland). Although minimal, most of the attention has been focused on services research and services courses. At Rensselaer, we have taken a two-prong approach to introducing services into our undergraduate and graduate courses; either by integrating service concepts and methods into our traditional industrial and management engineering courses or by developing new Operations Management\", \"Information and Decision Technologies for Industrial and Service Systems\", \"Models for Production Control and Service Logistics\", and \"Global Strategic Management of Technological Innovation\". In both cases and as discussed in the previous sections of this paper, we have built on or extended our manufacturing-related courses, differences, interdependences, similarities, and complementarities. Not surprisingly, there is a dearth of textbooks on services -except for such noteworthy texts as Fitzsimmons and Fitzsimmons (2006) -and on the relationship between services and manufacturing. In regard to services curricula or degree programs and except for what we have at Rensselaer, we are only aware of a few certificate programs, with each program being defined by 3-5 courses. Actually, it is not surprising that there is no undergraduate degree program in services, inasmuch as services is not a discipline -it is a multidiscipline or a combination of disciplines, including statistics, mathematics, computer science, management science, cognitive science, management, operations research, decision science, industrial engineering, systems engineering, electrical engineering, and man-machine systems. Moreover, because it-like manufacturing -is a multidiscipline, services can appropriately be the focus of a professional Master's degree. Indeed, at Rensselaer we have a Master's program in Engineering (SMSE). In the remainder of this section, our undergraduate degree in Industrial and Management Engineering (IME) and the above cited Master's degree are briefly described; again, both degrees have a focus on the services and manufacturing domains. While certain objectives of an undergraduate education in engineering are common to all disciplinary programs, there are obvious differences that highlight the individual disciplinary fields of interest.
