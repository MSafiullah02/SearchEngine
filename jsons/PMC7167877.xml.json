To prevent these bites, agitated birds will rest for only short periods of time, leading to reduced weight gain and feed conversion.9 In addition, mature beetle larvae climb building walls and posts and chew into building support structures and insulation, seeking pupation sites.10, 11 The 1996 cost of lesser mealworm control in Georgia alone was over $ 1 000 000, with estimated damage costs of $ 8 476 000.12\n",

Therefore, information was collected on all insecticide use at each facility. Insecticide use for fly control at the Cayuga County facility included premise applications of permethrin, tetrachlorvinphos and carbaryl, and feed mixtures containing cyromazine and methomyl fly bait. In this facility, walls and support beams were sprayed with either cyfluthrin or tetrachlorvinphos twice following each manure removal (approximately every 12\u201318 months). The birds were occasionally treated with carbaryl for northern fowl mites, Ornithonyssus sylviarum (Canestrini and Fanzago). Insecticide use (based on interviews with the facility managers) for fly control for at least the previous 5 years at the Wayne County and Onondaga County facilities was limited to pyrethrin space sprays and methomyl baits. Treatments for fly control at the Maine facility included nearly weekly applications of pyrethrins from 1998 to 2001, one application of dichlorvos, two applications of dimethoate and 10 weeks per year of cyromazine feed\u2010through use, as well as methomyl and nithiazine baits. All facilities remove manure every 6\u201318 months. No pesticide use history is available for either the Denmark\u2010S or Waycross County strains. However, because both of these strains were obtained from insect cultures, it is assumed that these strains received no pesticide exposure for at least the last 4 years.

A residual contact bioassay method was used for all the insecticides tested. Glass jars (30 mL volume, treated surface area 18 cm2, total internal surface area 33 cm2) were treated with 0.5 mL of insecticide in acetone, or acetone only for control treatments. Jars were put on an orbital shaker to ensure complete coverage of the bottom and about one\u2010quarter of the wall (beetles could not climb up the jars). The acetone was allowed to evaporate for at least 2 h before the introduction of beetles. A minimum of three doses giving >0% and <100% mortality after insecticide treatment was used for each experiment. Each experiment was replicated at least 3 times. The specimens used in the assays were 2\u20137 day post\u2010eclosion adult beetles or mature larvae that passed through a No. 14 US Standard sieve but were retained by a No. 16 sieve.14 Some 10\u201320 insects were placed inside a glass jar that had been treated with either insecticide or acetone only. Mortality was assessed after 48 h. Typically, a total of 50\u201380 adults and 50\u201380 larvae were treated per concentration per strain.

The highest levels of resistance were found with the Kennebec strain, which is somewhat surprising given the reported lack of cyfluthrin use at this facility. However, this population was from a facility that had been repeatedly treated with pyrethrins, which could result in cross\u2010resistance to pyrethroids such as cyfluthrin.18 Four of the five strains had less steep cyfluthrin log concentration\u2013probit (lcp) lines relative to the susceptible strain, resulting in higher resistance ratios at the LC95 and indicating that these strains are more heterogeneous than the susceptible strain. This suggests that resistance alleles are likely present in these populations. Adults from the Wayne strain were not significantly resistant to cyfluthrin at the LC95.",

Since the Waycross strain (from a cricket colony) had not been exposed to insecticides for many years, and given that highly resistant individuals can still be found in this strain, the present data indicate that the gene(s) responsible for the resistance have a negligible fitness disadvantage in the absence of insecticide use. Adults from the Wayne and Onondaga strains from caged\u2010layer poultry farms were also resistant to tetrachlorvinphos, but these strains did not have plateaus in their lcp lines.

Larvae from the other three strains were not significantly different from the susceptible strain in their response to tetrachlorvinphos (Table 4).

A goal for any resistance monitoring study is to identify the level of resistance detected in the assay, and relate it to the level of control seen in the field. To achieve this goal it will be necessary to conduct additional studies with these strains to examine the mortality response of adults and larvae to formulated materials applied to plywood (as would occur in a commercial setting) or to monitor the effectiveness of these insecticides directly at the poultry facilities. Clearly, the gene(s) involved in resistance to tetrachlorvinphos (in adults and larvae) do not exert a strong fitness cost as they are maintained in the Waycross strain even after several years of being reared in the lab without insecticide exposure. Similarly, Lambkin19 also reported retention of fenitrothion resistance for approximately 15 years in A. diaperinus. Since tetrachlorvinphos and fenitrothion are both organophosphates, it is possible that a similar mechanism of resistance exists for these two organophosphates in the USA and Australia. If so, this could explain why tetrachlorvinphos and fenitrothion resistance alleles are preserved in lesser mealworm populations in the USA. Identification of the gene(s) involved in the resistance will require further study.",
