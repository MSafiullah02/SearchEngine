As a response, there have been several treatment recommendations published by international, federal, state, and local governing bodies. Here, we aim to help neurosurgeons synthesize these recommendations into an institutional policy that fits the unique demands of neurosurgical practice. We performed a comprehensive review of COVD-19 policies and aggregated multidisciplinary expertise at our institution to formulate recommendations for scheduling surgery, providing neurosurgical coverage, and engaging in neurosurgical research during the COVID-19 outbreak. Here, we present a neurosurgical algorithm for varying levels of COVID-19 community infection. This algorithm (with an accompanying checklist) is centered around a 3-tiered system of viral \"surge\" quantification, which we use to triage case scheduling, and a paired coverage model (PCM), which we use to provide inpatient services. COVID-19 represents a challenge to ongoing practice; however, with clear algorithms, checklists, and contingency planning, it is possible to provide focused neurosurgical care during this pandemic.",

[6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] As of March 13, 2020, there were 1629 cases and 41 total deaths in the United States, according to the statistics compiled by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). 13 These cases have been concentrated in California, Washington, and New York; however, almost all states have reported cases of COVID-19. As our healthcare system faces this outbreak, the most pressing issues facing neurosurgeons involve (1) the decision to cancel elective cases and outpatient clinics, (2) organizing staff (including advanced practitioners and resident physicians) to minimize exposure risk, and (3) handling neurosurgical emergencies in situations where intensive care unit (ICU) bed availability is compromised by an increasing number of COVID-19 patients.",

In addition to this literature review, we sought the advice and expertise from neurosurgeons who had direct experience in China caring for neurosurgical patients during the COVID-19 outbreak. These neurosurgeons provided first-hand knowledge of how neurosurgical cases were scheduled during the peak of the COVID-19 outbreak in China. We included these recommendations as discussion points in our ERP.

The black level corresponds to the need for significant resources outside of our institution. As Figure 1 indicates, in the green level, all elective cases proceed as scheduled. In the yellow level, the OR schedule is capped for 3 wk to 75% of capacity, yielding a 25% reduction in all elective and procedural cases. During this time, all outpatient procedures should be designated to an off-site hospital where COVID-19 patients are not expected to be admitted. In addition, there is a hard cap on the number of cases requiring post-operative admission. In the red level, these numbers are more strict. Figure 1 ). In this model, each individual hospital (columns) will have 3 groups of providers: 2 teams that switch coverage on a 3-d cycle, and an alternate group that substitutes for any team member who shows signs of illness. In this way, if a team becomes contaminated, the other team will take over, and the alternates will fill the gap. Contact between teams and alternates is prohibited.

Previous work has shown that checklists help organize surgical staff during times of crisis, such as guiding action during \"red alerts\" from neuromonitoring during spinal surgery. 21 Here, we adapt the checklist strategy to organize surgical staff around the common goal of booking cases during the outbreak (Figure 3) .

And, while the ACS lays out general principles, 20 a detailed COVID-19 surgical treatment algorithm has not been previously published. Thus, our tiered volume limiting approach to restricting OR access based on the current surge level of the virus is novel. This volume limiting approach allows for dynamic resource allocation. By contrast, an alternative model would be to rank every type of surgical case ahead of time, and then triage cases based on these rankings. However, the volume limiting approach is more fluid, and allows surgeons to triage on a case-by-case basis, permitting more flexible operative plans based on the surge level, OR availability, and need for emergent cases. Thus, although neurosurgeons may feel pressure to cancel cases due to fear of intra-and perioperative COVID-19 transmission, these algorithms and checklists identify objective criteria for doing so.",
