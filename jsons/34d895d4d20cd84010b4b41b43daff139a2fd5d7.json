The value of each immunological parameter falls within a range specified in a database and each parameter was scored into three grades based on its value. In particular, values in the range of a cumulative frequency less than 10% of values observed for healthy subject were scored 1, which indicates a low immunity level; those between 10% and 40% were scored 2, which indicates a moderate immunity level; and those with 40% or higher were scored 3, which indicates a sufficiently high immunity level.

The database was obtained from approximately 500 normal healthy population ranging in age from 20 to 90 years. Immunological level of each individual was obtained by summation of 8 scores.
