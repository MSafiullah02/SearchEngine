The T\u2010protein, previously not implicated as biologically important, was recently shown to be present in fimbriae\u2010like structures in beta\u2010hemolytic group A streptococci and probably plays a role in tissue adhesion (56). Pyrogenic exotoxins (erythrogenic toxins) are superantigens capable of triggering T lymphocytes to release massive amounts of cytokines and interleukins, thereby generating severe symptoms such as fever, the scarlatiniform rash, tissue necrosis, hypotension and organ failure (4). The cysteine protease (identical to exotoxin SpeB) according to experimental work may be essential for circulatory shock and lung damage (31, 32). This enzyme, and a second cysteine protease of beta\u2010hemolytic group A streptococci, may cleave immunoglobulin G, thereby interfering with immune opsonization of beta\u2010hemolytic group A streptococci. Streptolysins S and O are capable of lysing erythrocytes as well as leukocytes and platelets (26, 77). Streptokinase, which converts plasminogen to plasmin, may significantly contribute to a rapid spread of beta\u2010hemolytic group A streptococci within infected tissue by lysing blood clots (51).",

It is not known if internalization into host cells can influence the severity of beta\u2010hemolytic group A streptococcal infections. Strains of streptococci show varying capacity to internalize (47, 94), and internalized beta\u2010hemolytic group A streptococci have been found in asymptomatic carriers as well as in patients with pharyngotonsillitis (95\n). Strains from patients with treatment failure exhibit a significantly increased ability to survive intracellularly in cultured epithelial cells compared with strains from successfully treated patients (53).

Impetigo, pharyngotonsillitis and erysipelas may be comparatively mild and are effectively treated with antibiotics. However, since the late 1980s, a rising number of life\u2010threatening invasive beta\u2010hemolytic group A streptococcal infections have been encountered, such as necrotizing fasciitis and streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (12, 36). Streptococci in these diseases are often restricted to certain M\u2010types, in particular M1, and produce powerful superantigens, such as the pyrogenic exotoxin A, SpeA. Surgical intervention is often needed in the case of necrotizing fasciitis. However, in spite of antibiotics and intensive care, the mortality is high for patients with necrotizing fasciitis or streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (14, 19). Acute rheumatic fever, the most serious nonsuppurative complication of beta\u2010hemolytic group A streptococcal pharyngotonsillitis, is the leading cause of acquired heart disease among children in developing countries (5). Although no longer a significant health problem in most socioeconomically advanced countries, limited outbreaks of acute rheumatic fever occurred in the USA in the 1980s (88).",

Concurrent symptoms from the respiratory tract (e.g. cough or rhinorrhea) indicate a viral origin of the disease. Established beta\u2010hemolytic group A streptococcal throat and skin infections in close surroundings of the patient such as at home, or in school or daycare centres, increases the probability of a beta\u2010hemolytic group A streptococcal origin of the infection. Certain symptoms are more pronounced in pharyngotonsillitis of a beta\u2010hemolytic group A streptococcal origin than in pharyngotonsillitis of another etiology. Thus, a high degree of redness in the throat (71), fever (30) and a shorter duration of symptoms before seeking medical care (79) correlate significantly with a beta\u2010hemolytic group A streptococci etiology. The so\u2010called Centor criteria have been widely used to implicate beta\u2010hemolytic group A streptococci in adult patients and these are as follows: tonsillar exudates, tender anterior cervical adenopathy, fever by history and absence of cough. If three of these criteria are met, the positive predictive value for a beta\u2010hemolytic group A streptococcal infection is 40\u201360% (11). The findings are, however, inconsistent and although the clinical picture may be of some guidance, it is seldom sufficient for establishing a reliable etiological diagnosis.",

Bacterial identification can be performed by obtaining a throat culture or by a rapid antigen detection test. A good view of the pharynx and obtaining proper sampling technique are essential to achieve a representative sample. The specimen should be obtained from the tonsillar surface because beta\u2010hemolytic group A streptococci in pharyngotonsillitis are predominantly localized on the tonsils and on the posterior oropharyngeal wall (48). The rapid antigen test requires more bacteria than required for culture. The quantity of sample material thus influences the sensitivity and specificity of the rapid tests, which are currently reported as being 74\u201397% and 89\u201395%, respectively (49, 58).",

During large outbreaks of beta\u2010hemolytic group A streptococcal pharyngotonsillitis, the carrier rate can be as high as 60% (21). A 4\u2010year longitudinal study of 5\u201315\u2010year\u2010old schoolchildren found that the period during which a child carried beta\u2010hemolytic group A streptococci of the same emm type averaged 10.8 weeks (range: 3\u201334 weeks). Many children, however, experienced several periods of carriage during the study and frequently exhibited switches in emm type (54). The risk of becoming a carrier of beta\u2010hemolytic group A streptococci, as well as of contracting pharyngotonsillitis, is related to the period of time spent in close contact with a patient during the week preceding the onset of illness (18, 89). The reason why some individuals become carriers is unknown, but the carrier state appears to be a relatively harmless condition because it probably does not result in a clinical infection (39) and the streptococci are present in low numbers (71), which probably does not support a person\u2010to\u2010person transmission of the organism (21). However, problems arise if a carrier of beta\u2010hemolytic group A streptococci acquires viral pharyngitis, because a positive test for beta\u2010hemolytic group A streptococci raises the issue of antibiotic treatment. This example highlights the importance of a careful evaluation of symptoms in order to avoid unnecessary antibiotic treatment.",

However, beta\u2010hemolytic group A streptococci are amongst the most virulent human pathogens, and patients with pharyngotonsillitis caused by infection with this bacterium can be seriously affected with high fever, dysphagia and severe pain. Although a majority of patients become free of symptoms within a week, irrespective of therapy, antibiotic treatment of pharyngotonsillitis caused by beta\u2010hemolytic group A streptococci can significantly shorten the duration of symptoms (13, 16). Antibiotic treatment may also, to some extent, reduce the risk of purulent complications, such as peritonsillitis, otitis and sinusitis (13, 15, 93). In acute rheumatic fever, it is claimed that a majority of the patients have a history of pharyngotonsillitis. The decline of acute rheumatic fever in the developed world may indeed be the result of routine antibiotic use for beta\u2010hemolytic group A streptococcal pharyngotonsillitis, supporting the present principles of treatment. Rheumatic fever is still a major health problem in many developing countries, and beta\u2010hemolytic group A streptococci have been estimated to be the eighth most common source of global mortality caused by a single pathogen (10). In necrotizing fasciitis and streptococcal toxic shock syndrome, however, the port of entry of beta\u2010hemolytic group A streptococci is seldom reported to be pharyngotonsillitis (14, 19).",

A possible explanation for this is that penicillin resistance in this species is not compatible with a virulent phenotype (29). In penicillin V treatment of beta\u2010hemolytic group A streptococcal pharyngotonsillitis, a treatment period of at least 10 days should be imposed in order to achieve an acceptably low recurrence rate (27, 75, 82, 93).

Viruses account for more than half of the cases of pharyngotonsillitis. Beta\u2010hemolytic group A streptococci are the etiological agents in 15\u201330% of cases, with higher figures observed during the winter months. Beta\u2010hemolytic group A streptococci are virulent human pathogens, which may cause suppurative and nonsuppurative complications, and sometimes life\u2010threatening diseases such as necrotizing fasciitis and streptococcal toxic shock syndrome. Signs and symptoms of a beta\u2010hemolytic group A streptococcal infection include tonsillar exudate, tender anterior cervical adenopathy, a history of fever and absence of a cough, but the findings are rather inconsistent. Identification of the bacterium by culture or by a rapid antigen test is needed to establish a definite diagnosis. Penicillin V for 10 days is the drug of choice in primary beta\u2010hemolytic group A streptococcal pharyngotonsillitis. Although penicillin resistance is not recorded in beta\u2010hemolytic group A streptococci, penicillin V treatment fails in as many as 5\u201325% of the patients, and higher failure rates can occur after a second course of penicillin V treatment, sometimes necessitating tonsillectomy. Factors potentially contributing to antibiotic treatment failure include low compliance rate, re\u2010infection from the environment, eradication of alfa\u2010hemolytic streptococci with an inhibitory effect on beta\u2010hemolytic group A streptococci, an increase in beta\u2010lactamase\u2010producing bacteria inactivating the drug, penicillin\u2010tolerant streptococci, low antibiotic concentration at the site of infection, and intracellular beta\u2010hemolytic group A streptococci surviving therapy. Treatment with cephalosporins or clindamycin has been reported to result in a less frequent recurrence of beta\u2010hemolytic group A streptococcal pharyngotonsillitis and is advocated in patients with beta\u2010hemolytic group A streptococcus pharyngotonsillitis not responding to penicillin V treatment.",
