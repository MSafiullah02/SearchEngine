Some of these autoantibodies are specific for myositis and are not present in other diseases. One of these myositis-specific autoantibodies is anti-Jo-1 autoantibody, directed against histidyl-tRNA-synthetase. This autoantibody is present in approx 20% of patients with myositis and is often associated with the presence of arthritis in finger joints, lung disease, Raynaud\u00b4s phenomenon, and skin problems of the hands (mechanic\u00b4s hands) (3) .",

Before this, different therapies were used, such as amino acids, vitamin E, and anabolic steroids, without any consistent beneficial effect.

To prevent toxicity of glucocorticoids, supplements such as potassium and antacids were given frequently.

In the muscle tissue of patients with myositis, several inflammatory and immunemediating molecules are produced. These are likely to be important for the clinical symptoms and for the muscle fiber damage and loss of muscle strength. These molecules are of interest as targets for new therapies that are more specific than glucocorticoids and other immunosuppressants that are used today. Such new therapies can be developed by modern molecular biology technology, as has successfully been the case, for example, in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and Chrohn\u00b4s disease.

This is well established in the membrane of joints in chronic arthritis (27) . Hypoxia could also be a consequence of loss of microvessels, capillaries, in muscle tissue that is a typical finding in dermatomyositis. Interestingly, a loss of capillaries seems to be an early event in dermatomyositis. More recently, we have also observed a reduced number of capillaries in muscle tissue in patients with polymyositis (unpublished data). As oxygen supply is crucial for aerobic muscle metabolism, hypoxia can have several negative consequences that affect the working capacity of muscles and could also affect the nutritional status of patients with chronic muscle inflammation.",

Although treatment with glucocorticoids made a dramatic improvement in patient survival, it soon became apparent that some patients with myositis do not respond at all and very few patients recover their former muscle performance. Furthermore, as also discussed previously, a disadvantage of high-dose glucocorticoid treatment is the substantial risk of side effects. For these reasons, combination therapies with other immunosuppressive agents have been developed. Today, glucocorticoids are still recommended as baseline treatment (starting doses of 0.75-1 mg/kg body weight per day), although most authors recommend combination with another immunosuppressant from the start as a glucocorticoid-saving drug and to improve the efficacy of treatment. The most often used immunosuppressants are azathioprine and methotrexate. Other therapies that are used in severe cases are cyclophosphamide, cyclosporine A, mycophenylate mofetile, tacrolimus or infusions with high doses of intravenous immunoglobulin. Only a few of these drugs have been tested in controlled trials of adequate size and duration to show beneficial effects. They are mostly used based on observed beneficial effects in occasional individuals or reported case series. Glucocorticoids can have profound negative effects on metabolism, making the immunosuppressive treatment of myositis an important issue with regard to nutritional status in patients with polymyositis and dermatomyositis. These topics are discussed further.",

After the first minute of work, the skeletal muscle is dependent on oxygen-generated ATP. The oxygen is provided to muscle by blood vessels including the small capillaries. By using the macronutrients-carbohydrates (glycogen), proteins (amino acids) and fat (fatty acids and glycerol)-energy is produced in the mitochondria in muscle cells, and the muscle will be able to contract (30).",

Arachidonic acid (AA), the precursor of the proinflammatory PGE 2 is an omega-6 (n-6) polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) and is metabolized from linoleic acid, found in nuts, seeds, and vegetable oils, such as corn oil (86) .",
