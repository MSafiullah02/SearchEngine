The author investigates why the European public's scientific knowledge, as measured by the surveys, has increased substantially over the past few years. He then reviews coverage of science in the European media and analyses the relationships between European scientists and journalists and recent trends in reportage. Noting that it has become harder to gain public acceptance of scientific and technological innovations in Europe, the author argues that the science-society dialogue is insufficiently developed because a genuine communication culture is lacking in the science and technology sector. This lack may hamper the advancement of the sector.",

Because the EU is providing increasing funding to research and innovation, the Directorate-General for Research has decided to gain a detailed understanding of the issues, variables and constraints faced by European researchers when communicating with wider audiences (EC 2007b,c) . To this end, in-depth telephone interviews were carried out with a sample of 100 researchers who have participated in projects funded by the European Commission's Research Framework Programme, based on the excellence of their scientific work. Researchers from all Member States and representing a broad spectrum of scientific fields were interviewed in order to adequately reflect different subgroups. The field work and data reporting were undertaken between the end of April and mid-June 2007. Only 20% of scientists interviewed have an active relationship with the media, although most have been sporadically or very occasionally involved in some way in communicating to a wider audience. Those scientists who currently take an active role believe that it is their moral duty to do so. There appears to be a significant willingness to create dialogue and partnership with the media to achieve better coverage of science as the key to improving the public's perception of scientific culture and its benefits. Despite these good intentions, it is worrying that so few senior scientists are involved in explaining topics that are vital to everyday life, because the scientific community depends on outside support to allow it to continue to make significant advances that benefit society.",

The great majority of scientists interviewed (just over 90%) recognise It seems that, for many scientists, explaining science in general and the scientific method are more important than the short-term dissemination of the results of their work. Although groundbreaking research results are likely to interest the media, there is great potential for scientists to be the interpreters of the day-to-day events that affect people's everyday lives, but that potential does not seem to have been fully harnessed by either side. For a scientist to feel comfortable in the science-media dialogue, there is a need for trust between the scientist and the media contact. However, scientists believe that this trust is best achieved through face-to-face contact, which means that establishing it remains difficult. This suggests that to improve communication between scientists and the media there is a need to find a more immediate and feasible mechanism to allow trust to be established.",

The goodwill shown by many is pushed to its limits by difficulties that to some extent stem from the lack of professional recognition for those scientists who are successful at communicating their work to the public. In a community that rewards specialist publications and does not emphasise the need for general communication, it is obvious that scientists lack funding to support specific communication measures and lack time to communicate.

According to the study carried out by the Royal Society (2006), a quarter of the British scientists surveyed considered that popularizing science and engaging with the public had a negative impact on their professional evolution. Moreover, as reported from the European Commission survey of researchers (EC 2007b), scientists too often see journalists as mere 'spokespersons'. They expect the media to just 'cut and paste' their words. As a result, scientists are keen to train themselves in science communication; they believe that this will enable them to 'package' their work in a form immediately digestible by journalists, hence discouraging detailed, in-depth investigations.",

While communication of every kind is on everyone's lips, we are still far from the genuinely 'intelligent' communication promised by the advent of the 'knowledge society'. Technologies-first and foremost the internet and the mobile phone-may be partly responsible for this paradox. Having pervasive 'means' of accessing and exchanging information creates the feeling that we are communicating better. While this is no doubt true in so far as society is spontaneously generating new and creative initiatives, much remains to be done when it comes to the various levels in established institutions and organizations. Rather late in the day, the world of science is now also in the grip of this communication fever. If nothing else, there is certainly a demand for S&T information! The 2005 Eurobarometer established that very clearly: Europeans want information on S&T, they want to be involved and they want to participate in decisions. The information supply is growing, albeit timidly and not without ulterior motives coming into play. However, many scientists wrongly view communication as the magic wand that will remove at a stroke all the doubts people have about new S&T. Also, but in this case with good reason, effective science communication is seen as a means of attracting extra funding for research. Of course, the danger is that funds will go to the most effective communicators rather than to the most excellent researchers.",
