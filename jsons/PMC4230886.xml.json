The next day she described non-bloody diarrhea and vomiting. A mild erythematous rash appeared on ID-5 on her chest and upper arms. Fever up to 39\u00b0C continued intermittently, escalating on ID-7, accompanied by retrosternal chest pain and worsening sore throat, after which she presented to a clinic in Lusaka (ID-8), where she was given broad spectrum antibiotics. By ID-9 the rash covered her entire body. Myalgias became more prominent and her face was noticeably swollen. Rapid deterioration occurred on ID-10 with progressive confusion and generalized tonic-clonic seizures.

            "text": "The four nosocomial infections of Lujo virus illustrate the risk to healthcare workers. Although no specific exposures were reported and some degree of personal protective equipment was worn by all four secondary or tertiary cases, it appears that strict barrier nursing practices were not always maintained and full VHF precautions were often implemented late in the course of treatment, if at all. Furthermore, the four infected healthcare workers generally had very close and sometimes prolonged contact with the patient, including in closed settings, such as the medical evacuation flight of Patient 1, augmenting the possibility of exposure to blood and bodily fluids. They also performed procedures that are often considered to be high risk, such as endotracheal intubation, insertion of indwelling intravascular catheters, and dialysis. The transmissibility of other emerging viruses such as SARS and MERS coronaviruses has similarly been enhanced when such procedures have been performed [15]. In addition to the 4 secondary/tertiary cases, another 94 persons were identified as contacts and monitored, including support staff (kitchen, laundry, cleaning), laboratory and radiography technicians, and nursing staff. We did not categorize contacts in terms of risk at the time, but now estimate that at least 30 of these would be reasonably categorized as high risk. Nevertheless, no suspected cases of LHF were noted in this group.",

The most detailed data are from Patient 5, who was the only patient for whom a specific diagnosis of VHF was considered and confirmed early in the course of disease. Despite receiving ribavirin at disease onset, Patient 5's clinical status deteriorated and her illness was severe and prolonged. Although these results could be interpreted as lack of efficacy of ribavirin against Lujo virus, this is unlikely considering the drug's proven efficacy in other arenavirus infections [8], [23]\u2013[25] Of greater importance was probably the fact that ribavirin was administered orally for the first 6 days of treatment. Efficacy of oral ribavirin for arenavirus infection has not been definitively shown and, in light of the significant first-pass hepatic metabolism resulting in an oral bioavailability of only \u223c50%, it is unlikely that oral administration reliably reaches the minimum inhibitory concentration for arenaviruses in serum [26] Serum levels are undoubtedly further diminished by decreased gut absorption, vomiting, and diarrhea in these severely ill patients.",

Animal models of sepsis have suggested that statin drugs may improve outcomes in septic shock [32], [10]. Furthermore, a large, population-based cohort analysis in Canada showed reduced risk of sepsis in patients with cardiovascular disease who were treated with statins [11]. Patient enrolment is currently ongoing for prospective trials of statin therapy after the development of sepsis. N-acetylcysteine is an antioxidant and free radical scavenger that resulted in decreased nuclear factor-\u03baB and interleukin-8 in patients with sepsis, suggesting a blunting of the inflammatory response [28]. Recombinant factor VIIa is a prohaemostatic agent thought to act at the local site of tissue injury and vascular wall disruption by binding to exposed tissue factor to promote generation of thrombin and platelet activation. [29]. The drug has been used in hemophilia and other coagulation disorders, as well as in liver disease, reversal of anticoagulant therapy, and for episodes of excessive or life threatening bleeding related to surgery or trauma [30], [31]. Other therapies being explored for sepsis and, in some cases specifically for VHF, such as the recombinant inhibitor of the tissue factor/factor VIIa coagulation pathway, rNAPc2, and activated protein C, were not used in this outbreak due to lack of availability and/or risk of bleeding. The seemingly counterintuitive use of anticoagulants like rNAPc2 stemmed from work with an Ebola virus animal model to ameliorate the effects of tissue factor resulting in DIC [21].",
