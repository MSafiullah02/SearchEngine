The coronavirus subfamily is further classified into 4 genera known as the alpha, beta, gamma, and delta coronaviruses. These viruses cause a wide variety of generally species-specific illness in mammals and birds, including chickens, turkeys, bats, rats, dogs, cats, piglets, and whales [21]. Coronaviruses were named for their characteristic crown-like surface projections seen in electron micrographs that correspond to large surface spike proteins. These viruses are enveloped, nonsegmented, positive-sense RNA viruses and have the largest identified viral RNA genomes, with an approximate length of 30 kilobases [24].",

Both HCoVs 229E and NL63 are alpha coronaviruses and HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-OC43, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV are beta coronaviruses (Table 1) [24, 25]. Phylogenetic analysis has revealed that SARS-CoV-2 also falls within the beta coronavirus in the same subgenus as the SARS-CoV, but in a different clade [26]. All 7 coronaviruses that infect humans are believed to have originated in bats [27, 28]. Based on modeling, it is speculated that HCoV-OC43 was transmitted to humans around 1890 [29]. Bats also appear to be the original host of SARS-CoV-2, and it is hypothesized that currently unknown wild animal(s) sold at the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan, China, might have played a role as an intermediate host to humans [26].",

In the 1970s, studies that used serology and viral culture linked HCoVs 229E and OC43 with 8% of cases of lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) in hospitalized infants [30, 31]. Poor replication in tissue culture and a lack of cytopathic effect in early attempts at culture were major obstacles in making further progress in the field. The development and widespread use of molecular diagnostics as well as the emergence of SARS-CoV in 2003 significantly accelerated coronavirus research. Subsequently, new HCoVs NL63 and HKU1 were identified and are frequently seen in children. Additional pathogenic coronavirus species and outbreaks with MERS-CoV and, recently, SARS-CoV-2 have led to increased interest, research, and concern [21, 23].",

All 4 species may circulate yearly and even simultaneously [34], with the highest rates of HCoV infection seen in winter and spring months in temperate climates [21]. Almost all surveillance data indicate HCoV-OC43 is the most common species. A large prospective surveillance study conducted in Norway from 2006 to 2015 that enrolled all hospitalized children aged \u226416 years with respiratory tract infections revealed that HCoVs OC43 and NL63 were detected most frequently and were epidemic every second winter [35].

The frequent detection of HCoVs in asymptomatic patients as well as coinfection with other respiratory viruses make the interpretation of HCoV pathogenesis and clinical findings challenging. A multicenter, prospective surveillance study conducted in the United States evaluated the prevalence of HCoVs among hospitalized children with acute respiratory illness and demonstrated that the prevalence of HCoVs was similar in both asymptomatic and symptomatic groups of children [52]. In contrast, a prospective community surveillance study of respiratory viruses in Utah showed HCoV detection was often associated with symptoms in all age groups, suggesting HCoV infection might have been previously underestimated as an etiology of respiratory tract infection [49].",

Specific HCoV species and associated risk factors for disease severity have been evaluated, although some studies did not address potential confounders, such as the presence of coinfection [56]. One retrospective study of 212 hospitalized children with HCoV (54 with and 158 without viral coinfection) showed that similar numbers of children received respiratory support and intensive care [57]. Bivariate analyses showed that younger age (<2 years) and chronic complex medical conditions (cardiovascular, respiratory, genetic, or congenital) were associated with increased disease severity. No specific species were associated with severity of illness. Although the presence of viral coinfection was not associated with increased disease severity, the analysis did not assess the impact of specific types of coinfections. A retrospective analysis of 1237 children who presented to Seattle Children\u2019s Hospital (Washington) for acute care with detected HCoVs showed that disease severity did not vary by HCoV species [58]. Younger age, presence of underlying pulmonary disorder, and presence of coinfection, particularly RSV, were associated with increased likelihood of LRTI in multivariable models. The impact of RSV coinfection with HCoV has been described in other studies [59].",

The cumulative incidence of HCoVs in children during the first 365 days following HCT are shown in Figure 2. HCoVs were detected in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) specimens from 2 young children in this cohort. The detection of HCoV in BAL specimens among HCT recipients and patients with hematologic malignancy was also evaluated, but only 1 of 35 patients was a child [69]. Among 16 patients in that study (15 adults, 1 child) with HCoV and without other coinfections identified by BAL, 10 required oxygen support, suggesting a role of HCoV as a significant respiratory pathogen. In a retrospective study of immunocompromised and nonimmunocompromised children with HCoV detected in nasal specimens in Seattle, the prevalence of LRTI that required oxygen supplementation (severe LRTI) was 15% (13/85) and 11% (122/1152), respectively [58].

Our follow-up study suggests that high viral load, high-dose steroids, and myeloablative conditioning are associated with prolonged shedding (\u226521 days) of HCoV in allogeneic HCT recipients (2 pediatric and 42 adult patients) [71]. Using available nasal samples from patients with prolonged shedding, we performed whole-genome sequencing, which revealed only small and slow genomic changes, consistent with previously estimated evolution rates. This is in contrast to more rapid genomic changes associated with influenza infections [72]. In addition, an 18-year-old pediatric patient had 3 HCoV species (OC43, HKU1, 229E) detected sequentially over a 5-month period without an associated poor outcome.",

All 4 species were found in 2.5% of stool samples (22/878) from children with gastroenteritis, whereas 1.7 % of stool samples (2/112) from controls were positive for HCoVs. However, other known enteric pathogens, such as rotavirus or norovirus, were also found in 18 of 22 stool samples in children with gastroenteritis. Among 4 patients with only HCoV detected in stool, 3 had respiratory symptoms [73]. Another study examined both stool and nasopharyngeal swabs in hospitalized children with acute gastroenteritis and in controls [74]. HCoVs were more frequently detected in patients with gastroenteritis than in controls (23/260, 8.8% vs 4/151, 2.6%, respectively). Interestingly, in patients with gastroenteritis, more than half (13/23) had respiratory symptoms and HCoVs were more frequently found in nasopharyngeal samples than in stool samples (22/256, 8.6%, vs 6/260, 2.3%, respectively). Based on these studies, the significance of HCoVs as enteric pathogens appears minor.",

Clinical manifestations of SARS-CoV in children are nonspecific, and it can be very difficult to differentiate SARS-CoV from other respiratory tract infections without laboratory testing in the outbreak setting. However, certain features may provide a clue. A comparison of 15 pediatric patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV and 15 age- and sex-matched patients with culture-confirmed influenza in Taiwan revealed that rates of fever, cough, and constitutional symptoms such as chills and myalgia were similar between the 2 groups, but patients with SARS-CoV had significantly less rhinorrhea, sputum production, and sore throat than those with influenza [88]. In general, respiratory and constitutional symptoms are similar in the beginning of the illness in children and adults. However, a much higher proportion of adult patients progress to severe pneumonia, even acute respiratory distress syndrome. In fact, despite a high mortality rate in adults (9.6%\u201316.7%) [83], there were no fatalities documented in the pediatric population [84\u201387].",

However, detailed information on pathogenesis, immunity, and viral characteristics of disease in children remains limited. Recent and ongoing epidemics of novel coronaviruses in the 21st century have highlighted issues of zoonotic origins of transmissible respiratory viruses and potential transmission, disease, and mortality related to these viruses. The role of children in the spread of disease with these novel viruses remains unclear. As the current pandemic with SARS-CoV-2 unfolds, more information regarding the role of children in viral transmission and their clinical presentation and outcome will become more evident. Further study of coronaviruses in humans is imperative.",
