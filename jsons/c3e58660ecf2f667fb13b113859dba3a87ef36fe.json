The Korean Classification of Diseases (KCD) also reflects these efforts. In 2010, the third edition of the Korean Classification of Diseases of Oriental Medicine (KCDOM3) was incorporated into the Korean modification of the ICD-10, or KCD 6, using U codes (U20-U99) [3] .

While this chapter includes codes such as U04 for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), most of the codes in this chapter were developed to incorporate patterns or disorders diagnosed through Korean medicine (U20-U99). In Korea, doctors of Korean medicine are advised to use KCD 6, which is based on Western medicine, as their 2 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine primary code system; however, when the doctor cannot correlate the diagnosis specifically to KCD 6, the doctors are to supplement the diagnosis with a U code [5] . While KCDOM2 (1994) , which was based on Korean medicine, was used by doctors of Korean medicine instead of KCD 5, the overlap and mismatch of some diseases between KCD and KCDOM caused serious confusion. Therefore, U codes were developed to support the patterns and symptoms diagnosed only through Korean medicine while incorporating many of the disease codes from KCDOM2 that showed similar characteristics to KCD 6 codes. For example, terminology in Korean medicine that refers to cancer was absorbed into KCD 6 because the symptoms of the two different codes were almost identical; however, terminology in Korean medicine referring to patterns of disorders, such as qi deficiency pattern/syndrome, remained under U codes [3] . Therefore, through the third revision, KCDOM eliminated the overlapping disease classifications between the previous KCDOM and KCD5 and reorganized the remaining disorders and patterns into U codes, which reduced possible duplicate coding and allowed pattern identification and diagnosis through Korean medicine. The incorporation of KCDOM3 into KCD 6 was also conducted to meet the needs of doctors of Korean medicine to more effectively reflect the patient's condition.

Burden of disease is a crucial input into health policy, because it provides an account of health loss due to different risks through a disease-by-disease analysis [7] . Most health analyses concentrate on mortality, thereby omitting nonfatal, chronic diseases that affect quality of life [8] . At the same time, a focus on noncommunicable or chronic diseases has gained support as the morbidity and comorbidity of chronic diseases in the general population have increased [9] . The measurement of the burden of diseases, or Global Burden of Disease Study (GBD), was initiated in 1992, with three major goals: (1) to provide information on nonfatal health outcomes, as most of the health policies are generally focused on mortality; (2) to develop epidemiological assessments for major disorders without bias; and (3) to quantify the burden of disease with a measure that could also be used for cost-effectiveness analysis [10] . Research is currently being conducted in different countries for diverse risk factors, such as recent analyses of the global burden of disease due to ischemic heart disease, and to determine if there is epidemiological convergence across countries [1, 11] . Different approaches have been taken in burden of disease studies, including disability weights to cover the burden of disease more elaborately [12] . The foremost milestone, one of the most important milestones, of the GBD study was the development of the composite indicator disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), which is being used throughout diverse academic research as a summary measure of the overall burden of disease and is expressed as the number of years lost due to ill-health, disability, or early death [8] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 83, "end": 86, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 253, "end": 256, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 378, "end": 381, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 562, "end": 565, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1012, "end": 1016, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1267, "end": 1270, "text": "[1,", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 1271, "end": 1274, "text": "11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1421, "end": 1425, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1796, "end": 1799, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Using DALYs, the burden of different diseases and risk factors have been analyzed in Korea using nationally representative data provided by health-related government agencies such as the Health Insurance Review & Assessment Service (HIRA) and National Health Insurance Service (NHIS) [13] .

Although there are Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine 9 some limitations, quantification of the proportion of U codes to KCD 6 codes and redistribution of those codes enable a better understanding of Korean medicine health care utilization. Furthermore, the relationship between U codes and KCD 6 codes through data visualization provides a way of understanding U code disorders and patterns from the KCD 6 perspective. Furthermore, it provided a deeper understanding of the disorders and patterns of U codes through KCD 6 diseases. This data visualization showed that musculoskeletal diseases accounted for a large part of Korean medicine utilization. Furthermore, the methodology applied in this study serves as an initial study to quantify U codes through KCD 6 codes, providing guidelines for further research of the burden of diseases, including other countries with a dual health care system similar to that in Korea.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conclusions"}], "bib_entries": {"BIBREF0": {"ref_id": "b0", "title": "0%)
