Multiple US large center retrospective cohorts showed that 24\u201328% of severely injured trauma patients are found to be coagulopathic on admission. Coagulopathic patients have significantly higher mortality rates, while the degree of coagulopathy correlated with the severity of injury [9\u201311]. Analysis of the German Trauma Registry yielded similar results with rates of coagulopathy up to 34% as well as a direct correlation between the amount of crystalloid received prehospital and an increasing degree of coagulopathy [12]. Looking back at the first decade of war in Iraq, 33% of combat casualties were coagulopathic on admission, which correlated with a fivefold increase in mortality [13]. These data highlight the importance of recognizing the early onset of the coagulopathy of trauma at the time of injury, as well as endothelial damage, which plasma has been shown to correct [14]. Therefore, correction of coagulopathy should not be delayed until laboratory values are available to guide therapy and goals of care. The approach to the trauma patient should aim at preventing and correcting this coagulopathy as soon as possible to decrease its effects on mortality and progression of shock.",

During this conflict, over 335,000 units of blood products were transfused with nearly 110,000 being plasma [16, 17]. Analysis of combat casualties over 10 years revealed improved survival in those receiving a higher ratio of plasma and platelets to blood [13]. By 2010, clinical practice guidelines implemented by the Department of Defense (DoD) led to almost 100% of combat massive transfusions to be at a 1:1:1 ratio [18]. The PROMMTT trial then showed that early plasma administration was associated with reduced mortality in the first 6 h [3]. Following that, the PROPPR trial demonstrated that patients transfused with a higher plasma ratio achieved more hemostasis and had less early death due to exsanguination [19].",

A recent review of US combat casualties in Afghanistan rescued by medical evacuation (MEDEVAC) units showed that early blood product transfusion prehospital or within minutes of injury resulted in greater 24-h and 30-day survival [21]. In a large civilian cohort from a level 1 trauma center, prehospital administration of blood products including RBCs and plasma has been shown to be feasible and beneficial with improved acid-base status on admission and decreased overall blood product use in 24 h as well as a reduction in the risk of death in the sickest patients over the first 6 h [22].

It is important to use plasma as the primary resuscitation fluid for patients who are bleeding [4]. Other benefits of plasma stem from its ability to mitigate the effects of shock on physiology. The role of plasma in the correction of the endotheliopathy of trauma has been reported in multiple studies and is likely more important than correcting coagulopathy. The mechanism of action is thought to be through promoting systemic vascular stability and preventing endothelial permeability, coagulopathy, and inflammation which eventually lead to shock and end-organ failure [24, 25]. Moreover, in a rat model of injury and shock, plasma was able to restore the endothelial glycocalyx, improve syndecan-1 expression\n, and correct lung injury caused by shock [26].",

Neuroprotective effects of plasma in hemorrhagic shock and TBI are thought to be due to improved cerebral perfusion, decreased glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity, and reduction in mitochondrial dysfunction as demonstrated in animal models [28]. Plasma also reduced the size of brain lesions and swelling in multiple swine models of TBI and hemorrhagic shock [29, 30]. It also incurs neuroprotection by providing higher brain oxygenation and cerebral perfusion profiles [30]. In humans, a large retrospective cohort analysis showed that in the subgroup of patients with multifocal intracranial hemorrhage, early administration of plasma was associated with a survival benefit [31].",

In the USA, half of all trauma patients are cared for outside of levels 1 and 2 trauma centers, where blood products are frequently not readily available [32]. In the military, forward surgical teams (FST) were developed to provide immediate support and treatment to injured soldiers. They used to only carry red blood cells (RBCs) for transfusion, and more recently, they are able to provide plasma but not platelets [33]. Warm fresh whole blood (WFWB) is available in these circumstances and has been shown to improve survival in combat casualties treated by FST [33]. These challenges, along with misconceptions regarding the role of blood products in resuscitation, led to the overuse of crystalloids and its own set of unique complications. Excessive crystalloid resuscitation has been shown to be detrimental, while balanced blood product resuscitation decreases the onset of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and abdominal compartment syndrome and improves survival [32, 34].",

He believed plasma was all that was needed to treat hemorrhagic shock [37\u201339]. Elliot utilized pooling by mixing the plasma of up to eight donors together to neutralize anti-A and anti-B antibodies and eliminate the need for cross-matching [38, 40]. Reports of treating shock with dried plasma go back as early as 1938 [41]. In 1940, the British Army called upon the American Red Cross to provide plasma shipped directly to London, and the blood plasma for Great Britain project started [42, 43]. The \u201cBlood for Britain\u201d campaign resulted in almost 15,000 units of blood donated from 1940 to 1941 in New York City alone with the majority used to produce liquid plasma, while the RBCs and platelets were discarded. The program was then stopped due to high incidence of bacterial contamination in liquid plasma [42, 43].",

During the same time, the German Red Cross started processing pooled plasma with a solvent/detergent (S/D) treatment as a method of pathogen inactivation.

Spray-dried plasma production utilizes atomization of liquid plasma via pressurized drying gas to droplets which are then exposed to hot gas (up to 150 \u00b0C) in a drying chamber followed by rapid evaporative cooling. This method can dry a unit of plasma (~250 mL) in approximately 25 min [17, 46]. Dried plasma can then be reconstituted to its original volume or a concentrated form. Multiple pathogen inactivation methods are available to use during the process, and the choice depends on the manufacturer\u2019s preference and experience.",

Pathogen inactivation methods used for plasma include solvent/detergent (S/D) treatment and photochemical inactivation techniques [17]. S/D treatment, which is FDA-approved, binds lipid-enveloped viruses and bacteria to inactivate them followed by a filtration process to remove cells and debris, but it has no effect against non-enveloped viruses and prions [48]. Rigorous screening standards require testing donors for non-enveloped viruses twice at a 6-month interval to decrease the risk of transmission. Moreover, photochemical inactivation utilizes a photosensitizer that binds the DNA and RNA of pathogens, including non-enveloped viruses, and nucleated cells, followed by ultraviolet light exposure to inactivate them [49]. INTERCEPT (Cerus Corp., Concord, CA) is an FDA-approved system, which uses amotosalen (a psoralen molecule) to bind DNA and RNA followed by UV light activation [50]. The Mirasol System (Terumo BCT, Lakewood, CO), which uses riboflavin as the photosensitizer, is currently approved for clinical use in Europe but only approved for investigational use in the USA and Canada [51].

Retrospective analysis showed significantly less time to product administration between patients receiving\nFLyP vs. FFP (median 15 vs. 95 min). This is consistent with similar reports in the literature of time to FFP transfusion [21]. Subsequently, time to achieve 1:1 resuscitation ratio with RBCs was shorter in FLyP group. There were also significantly less cases of massive transfusion utilization and RBC transfusion in the FLyP group compared to the FFP group (7 vs. 45%).

Physicians are forced to use crystalloid and colloid in such situations to stabilize patients. Furthermore, trauma casualties in remote locations requiring long transport times or austere environments requiring prolonged extrication will be at a huge disadvantage. Finally, soldiers and combat casualties are also negatively affected by the delay of plasma transfusion, which has been demonstrated over and over again.",

Dried plasma should certainly replace the recommended crystalloid administration in the ATLS guidelines, which were designed to accommodate all levels of practice and take into account the variable availability of blood products. Taking this concept one step further, it may prove beneficial and efficient to replace FFP altogether, especially when time to transfusion is a critical element of care, thus eliminating the need for cold storage facilities and complicated thawing equipment and procedures. The future of lyophilized plasma is exciting, and while it is an old product, it will likely see a new beginning.",
