When particle size is reduced below this threshold, the resulting material exhibits physical and chemical properties that are significantly different from the properties of macroscale materials composed of the same substance. Research in the nanotechnology field has skyrocketed over the last decade, and already there are numerous companies specializing in the fabrication of new forms of nanosized matter, with anticipated applications that include medical therapeutics and diagnostics, energy production, molecular computing and structural materials. In 2008, nanotechnology demanded over $15 billion in worldwide research and development money (public and private) and employed over 400,000 researchers across the globe [1]. Nanotechnologies are projected to impact at least $3 trillion across the global economy by 2020, and nanotechnology industries worldwide may require at least 6 million workers to support them by the end of the decade [1].",

Undeniably, the most active area of food nanoscience research and development is packaging: the global nano-enabled food and beverage packaging market was 4.13 billion US dollars in 2008 and has been projected to grow to 7.3 billion by 2014, representing an annual growth rate of 11.65% [10]. This is likely connected to the fact that the public has been shown in some studies to be more willing to embrace nanotechnology in \u201cout of food\u201d applications than those where nanoparticles are directly added to foods [7], [11], [12].",

Covered topics include polymer nanocomposites for stronger, higher barrier packaging materials, nanoparticle-based antimicrobials, and sensors/assays that detect contaminants in foods or monitor changes in packaging conditions or integrity. Specific health concerns related to these various applications are also briefly described.

The adsorption rate is generally dependent on the rate of formation of free volume holes in the polymer created by random (Brownian) or thermal motions of the polymer chains, and diffusion is caused by jumps of molecular gas molecules to neighboring (empty) holes. Thus the permeability of polymer films is dependant on free volume hole sizes, degree of polymer motion, and specific polymer\u2013polymer and polymer\u2013gas interactions, all of which can be affected by intrinsic polymer chemistry as well as external properties such as temperature and pressure. Of course, the overall rate of gas diffusion is also directly dependant on the film thickness.",

The first way is by creating a tortuous path for gas diffusion [89]. Because the filler materials are essentially impermeable inorganic crystals, gas molecules must diffuse around them rather than taking a (mean) straight line path that lies perpendicular to the film surface. The result is a longer mean path for gas diffusion through the film in the presence of fillers, as illustrated in Fig. 2\n. Essentially, the tortuous path allows the manufacturer to attain larger effective film thicknesses while using smaller amounts of polymer.",

            "text": "The effect of dispersed nanomaterials on the mean path length for gas diffusion has been modeled theoretically. The simplest model, first proposed by Nielsen, assumes that fillers are evenly dispersed throughout the matrix and take the shape of rectangular platelets of uniform size, and supposes that the tortuosity of the path is the only factor influencing the gas diffusion rate [90]. In the Nielsen model, the gas permeability is given by(1)KcompositeKmatrix=1-\u03d51+\u03b12\u03d5where the K values represent permeabilities of the composite material and of the matrix in the absence of filler, \u03d5 is the volume fraction of filler and \u03b1 is the aspect ratio (length divided by width) of the individual filler particles. This equation shows that as the particles become more anisotropic or plate-like in shape, the barrier effectiveness is expected to increase, a prediction which has been experimentally verified [89]. In practice, the Nielsen model is valid only for small loading percentages (\u03d5\n < 10%), as higher loadings result in particle agglomeration, which in turn effectively reduces the mean particle aspect ratio [89] and may affect other properties of the system such as the amount of polymer available to intercalate into the nanoclay galleries and the proportion of \u201cinterphase\u201d regions in which the nanoclay surface and any organic modifiers interact directly with the polymeric host material [91]. Improvements on the Nielsen model include adjustments for random positioning of the filler throughout the matrix [92], [93], [94], as well as filler shape (e.g., hexagonal [95] or disk [96], [97]), size uniformity [94], [98], angular orientation with respect to the lateral dimension of the film [99], [100], degree of agglomeration or stacking [98], [101], and high nanoclay filler contents [91]. Temperature effects have also been studied [91]. In general all of these models predict that large volume fractions or large particle aspect ratios are required to reduce the gas permeability by an appreciable degree. These theoretical considerations have been reviewed in detail [89] and some of the more widely utilized models have recently been tested experimentally over a full range (0\u2013100 vol.%) of nanoclay filler content and modified accordingly [91].",

The second way that nanoparticulate fillers influence the barrier properties is by causing changes to the polymer matrix itself at the interfacial regions. If the polymer\u2013nanoparticle interactions are favorable, polymer strands located in close proximity to each nanoparticle can be partially immobilized. The result is that gas molecules traveling through these interfacial zones have attenuated hopping rates between free volume holes, or altered density and or size of holes, a fact which has been observed directly via the use of positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy (PALS) [89], [102], [103], [104]. In addition, the presence of surfactants or other additives used to efficiently incorporate the filler into the matrix can also affect the diffusivity or solubility of permeants. The effects of the interfacial regions have been found to be particularly important in polymer matrices that possess very high native gas permeabilities, such as polyolefins [105]. Attempts have been made to model the effect of the interfacial regions [89], [106], [107] on the diffusivity properties of migrant gasses through polymer films, but the relevant parameters are not always easily measurable.",

These considerations also demonstrate why nanomaterials have been so successful as fillers for polymer composites: compared to micro-scale fillers, nanoparticles have much higher aspect ratios and, due to their high surface area to volume ratios, the interfacial volume element in a PNC film is significantly greater than that of a polymer microcomposite created from the same materials. It is also worth mentioning that gas transport properties can also be modified in the absence of exogenous nanofillers; semicrystalline polymers such as PET and PE have gas permeabilities that are directly related to their degree of crystallinity due to the fact that nanocrystalline regions within the polymer matrix increase tortuosity of gas diffusion and effect changes to the gas transport regions of the interfacial regions [108], [109]. In other words, crystalline regions of semicrystalline polymers act as nanoscale fillers. Unfortunately, polymer crystallinity is difficult to measure accurately,\n2 and is dependent on numerous processing and structural factors [109], although some recent efforts at controlling polymer crystallinity in nanoscale layered assemblies has yielded some impressively high oxygen barriers [110].",

The popularity of nanoclays in food contact applications derives from their low cost, effectiveness, high stability and (alleged) benignity. The prototypical clay utilized in PNC applications is montmorillonite (MMT) [(Na,Ca)0.33(Al,Mg)2(Si4O10)(OH)2\u00b7nH2O)], a soft 2:1 layered phyllosilicate clay comprised of highly anisotropic platelets separated by thin layers of water (Fig. 3\n). The platelets have an average thickness of \u223c1 nm and average lateral dimensions ranging between a few tens of nm to several \u03bcm. Each platelet contains a layer of aluminum or magnesium hydroxide octahedra sandwiched between two layers of silicon oxide tetrahedra. The faces of each platelet have a net negative charge, which causes the interstitial water layer (known as the gallery) to attract cations (Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+, etc.) and allows for the construction of multi-layer polymer assemblies under appropriate conditions (Section 2.3).",

These structural characteristics contribute to MMT\u2019s excellent utility as a filler material for PNCs, typically giving rise to impressive increases in polymer strength and barrier properties with only a few wt.% added to the polymer matrix. However, because they have such large surface energies, clay nanoplatelets tend to stick together, particularly when dispersed in nonpolar polymer environments. Agglomeration of clay platelets leads to tactoid structures (microcomposites) with reduced aspect ratios and, according to the Nielsen model, reduced barrier efficiencies. When polymer\u2013clay interactions are more favorable, or when steps are taken (e.g., sonication [112]) to disaggregate the platelets, intercalated and fully exfoliated PNC structures are formed [64], [111], [113], [114]. Intercalated morphologies are characterized by moderate intrusion of polymer strands into the gallery volume, and the shape of the layered stack is preserved. In fully exfoliated structures, on the other hand, individual platelets are well separated and have extremely favorable interactions with the polymer matrix [115]. These various nanoclay morphologies are depicted in Fig. 4\n.",

Melt processing, in situ polymerization and solution-based processing techniques may be more or less suitable for different filler/polymers systems [118], [119], [120], and an excellent review [121] discusses these relationships extensively. As one example, Yeh et al. showed that when MMT platelets are present during in situ polymerization of poly(methylmethacrylate) (PMMA), the resulting MMT/PMMA PNCs have better clay exfoliation and thus significantly lower OTR and water vapor transmission rate (WVTR) values (compared to virgin polymer) than when the MMT was incorporated into commercially purchased PMMA by solution dispersion [122]. Pereira et al. recently showed that the type of extrusion method also can have an enormous effect on the final barrier properties of a MMT/polyamide PCNC film, with OTR rates varying over three orders of magnitude for films made of the exact same polymer and filler materials [123]; a similar dependency of mechanical properties on processing method for MMT/polyamide has also been observed [123], [124]. In this regard, it is clear that controlling the nanoparticle dispersion morphology (i.e., tactoid, intercalate, exfoliate) is important, as it has an enormous influence on the bulk properties of the PCNC materials [73]. For instance, Gorrasi et al. [125] studied the correlation between nanoparticle morphology and water vapor barrier of a series of MMT/polycaprolactone (PCL) composites, and found that while PCL PCNCs possessing the tactoid (microcomposite) and intercalated nanoparticle structures exhibited diffusion parameters close to those of virgin PCL, fully exfoliated structures led to values that were roughly two orders of magnitude lower.",

Good dispersibility of nanoclay platelets in hydrophobic matrices is typically achieved by functionalizing the polar clay surface with organic ammonium ions bearing long aliphatic chains [70], [82], [105], [126], [127]. Note that these organofunctional groups need not be passive spectators: efficient exfoliation of MMT in PMMA and PS polymers can be achieved by functionalizing the MMT particles with an organoammonium ion bearing two styrene groups, which directly participate in an in situ polymerization of the matrix [128].",

            "text": "Not surprisingly, PCNC barrier properties depend on the type of organic compatibilizer utilized due to varying effects on nanoparticle morphology. For example, moisture permeability of a MMT/epoxy PCNC material using octadecylamine as an organic modifier is lower than when the modifier is a quarternary alkylamine [129]; in the latter case, dispersed MMT nanoparticles possess a mean interlayer distance (d-spacing) of 3 nm, compared to the 8 nm mean interlayer separation of MMT particles functionalized with octadecylamine, resulting in less efficient exfoliation and poorer barrier behavior. A more systematic demonstration of the influence of the modifier on degree of MMT exfoliation and, hence, gas barrier properties is provided by Osman et al., who utilized quaternary ammonium modifiers bearing either one, two, three or four long alkyl (octadecyl) chains [130]: when MMT/polyethylene nanocomposites were fabricated using modifiers having more numerous long alkyl chains, the clay platelets generally had larger d-spacing values (inter-platelet separation) due to steric interactions, and thus better gas barriers. MMT clays with better cation exchange capacities also exhibited better degrees of exfoliation within the polymer matrix due to similar steric considerations. When all of the data-sets are combined, a clear inverse correlation between d-spacing and oxygen transmission rate is apparent, as shown in Fig. 5\n. The Osman study is a great example of the power of chemistry and nanotechnology: a clear understanding of the factors involved, combined with the unique chemical properties of nanoscale particles, can lead to impressive control over the physical properties of macroscopic materials.",

The initial interest in PCNC materials stemmed from gains in strength and fire retardancy, and it was not until over a decade after their first appearance in the literature that their impressive barrier properties were fully realized and PCNC-based food packaging materials development commenced [118]. Over the last 25 years, hundreds of clay-based PNC systems have been reported, and nanoscale clay materials have been successfully incorporated into virtually every important class of synthetic or natural polymer. This body of work is especially exciting in light of the evident success in using PCNCs to improve the mechanical and barrier properties of biocompatible polymers, which in their virgin states are either too brittle or water-sensitive to enjoy widespread commercial use in the food industry. Some clay/polymer examples are provided in Table 1\nalong with selected oxygen and moisture permeability data.

In two recent studies, they reported LBL assembled films of MMT/poly(acrylamide) [165] and MMT/poly(ethylene imine) [166] which have oxygen permeabilities and transmission rates below instrument detection thresholds while only being a fraction of a micron thick. For instance, an oxygen permeability of <2 \u00d7 10\u22129\n cc m\u22121\n day\u22121\n atm\u22121 (below the instrument detection limit) was achieved with a 70 bilayer film only 230.75 nm thick, as illustrated in Fig. 6. Oxygen permeability was also found to be dependent both on the number of bilayers in the film as well as the pH of the polymer solution, giving rise to materials whose oxygen transport properties were tailorable to any desired value within a broad range. More impressively, in a follow up study [167], the Grunlan group used a three component (MMT/PAA/PEI) system as the basis for a flexible LBL assembled film which at a mere 51\n \nnm thick (four MMT/PEI/PAA/PEI quadlayers) exhibited virtually undetectable oxygen transmission when coated on a PET substrate. For comparison to these values, the oxygen permeability of a 25,400 nm (1 mil) thick film of EVOH, generally considered to be one of the best food-packaging polymers when high oxygen barriers are required, has an oxygen permeability of 2.76\u201318.70 \u00d7 10\u22126\n cc m\u22121\n day\u22121\n atm\u22121 (measured at 0% relative humidity), depending on the degree of EVOH hydroxyl functional group content [16]. In other words, the LBL-assembled nanocomposite films have oxygen permeabilities several orders of magnitude lower than a 1 mil EVOH film while at the same time being over four orders of magnitude thinner.",

The clay platelets are organized in neat monolayers with a well-defined polymeric region in between each monolayer (Fig. 6, inset). This is an efficient way to promote extensive exfoliation of the clay particles within the polymer matrix. In addition, because each particle is essentially oriented perpendicular to the gas migration direction, the tortuosity of the migration path is optimized, as predicted by theory [89]. Such precise control over the clay particle orientation and morphology within a polymer matrix would be nearly impossible to achieve with conventional processing techniques, and thus for PNC food packaging materials that possess good optical clarity and the highest oxygen barriers, LBL fabrication methodologies or other bottom-up strategies may be the wave of the future.",

More relevant to behavior with real food systems is a 2007 study [151] which showed that total microbial and mold counts on apple slices decreased significantly over a period of 10 days when packaged in CaCO3/iPP PNC films, as opposed to apples stored in neat isotactic PP, which experienced an increase of total mesophilic microflora over the same time period.

The main risk of consumer exposure to PNC packaging is through migration\n3 of nanoparticles or other substances from packages into packaged foods which are then eaten, yet migration studies of PNC materials are ambiguous and few in number. A 2005 study [169] showed that vegetables in contact with clay/starch nanocomposite films exhibited no trends in their iron and magnesium content, but manifested elevated levels of silicon; the authors alleged that the results demonstrated either no appreciable migration of the constituent elements of the clay nanoparticles into the food, or migration within the limits set forth by then-current European Union (EU) regulations. A separate study showed that Uvitex OB, a commonly used additive to polyolefins approved for food contact use in Europe (2002/72/EEC), has very low release into oil-based and aqueous-based food simulants from a MMT/wheat-gluten PNC film, compared to up to 60% loss in LLDPE films subjected to the same test [170]. This MMT/wheat-gluten film also permitted aluminum and silicon migration into food simulants that was allegedly well within the limits set forth by European regulations, although the authors of this study were careful to point out that the more difficult quantification of nanoparticle migration should ideally be performed. Finally, a 2010 paper revealed that diffusion of triclosan and trans-,trans-1,4-diphenyl-1,3-dibutadiene (DPBD), two other common additives, was slower in poly(amide)/clay PCNCs than in neat poly(amide) [171].",

A theoretical treatment has predicted that montmorillonite particles with surface modification embedded in various polymer matrices are unlikely to migrate into foods from a polymer nanocomposite food contact material in any detectable quantities [172]. Nevertheless, more comprehensive experimental studies need to be done in PCNCs made from common-use food-contact polymers such as PET, especially since some food and beverage companies are already utilizing these materials in their products. More importantly, the availability of clay nanoparticle toxicology data is still lacking, as are developments in strategies to detect and categorize clay and other nanoparticles in complex food matrices. One study determined that exfoliated silicate nanoclays exhibited low cytotoxicity and genotoxicity, even when part of a diet fed to rats (measured acute oral toxicity, median lethal dose, LD50\n > 5700 mg/kg body weight under the conditions probed) [173]; however the authors of this study only tested a single clay type and morphology, so it is unclear whether it can be applied in a general sense. Furthermore, it has recently been shown [170] that PCNC films exhibit enhanced migration of nanoclay components into food simulants when the films undergo high-pressure treatment, a food preservation/sterilization method that is becoming increasingly popular; a follow up study [174] demonstrated that MMT clays undergo undetermined structural or chemical changes under pressures as low as 300 MPa and concluded that \u201csuch changes should be taken into consideration when binging [sic] montmorillonite\u2013polymer composites into contact with food.\u201d",

Since the earliest published reports of the antimicrobial properties of silver colloids, silver nanoparticles (AgNP) have been found to be potent agents against numerous species of bacteria, including: E. coli\n[211], [212], [213], [214], [215], [216], [217], [218], [219], [220], [221], [222], [223], [224], [225], [226], [227], [228], [229], Enterococcus faecalis\n[214], [222], [229], Staphylococcus (aureus\n[214], [220], [222], [223], [225], [226], [228], [229] and epidermidis\n[214], [222]), Vibrio cholerae\n[213], [220], Pseudomonas (aeruginosa\n[213], [214], [222], putida\n[230], fluorescens\n[229], [231] and oleovorans\n[232]), Shigella flexneri\n[220], Bacillus (anthracis\n[223], subtilis\n[219] and cereus\n[229]), Proteus mirabilis\n[223], Salmonella enterica Typhimurium [213], [220], [225], [229], Micrococcus luteus\n[225], Listeria monocytogenes\n[229] and Klebsiella pneumoniae\n[214], [222], [229]. AgNPs are also effective against strains of these organisms that are resistant to potent chemical antimicrobials, including MRSA, MRSE, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) and extended-spectrum \u03b2-lactamase (ESBL) producing Klebsiella\n[214], [222]. In addition, AgNPs are toxic to fungi (e.g., Candida albicans\n[223], [229], [233], [234], Aspergillus niger\n[229], [232], Trichophyton mentagrophytes\n[233] and yeast isolated from Bovine mastitis [228]), algae (e.g., Chlamydomonas reinhardtii\n[235]) and phytoplankton (e.g., Thalassiosira weissflogii\n[236], [237]), and are inhibitory to at least two viruses (HIV [238] and monkeypox [239]).",

The most conservative viewpoint is that silver atoms detach from the surfaces of AgNPs and cause cellular damage by the exact same mechanisms observed for conventional silver antimicrobials. Some studies which show that AgNPs are more toxic than an equivalent amount of dissociated silver ion cite the \u201cTrojan Horse\u201d model for engineered nanoparticle toxicity [240], whereby AgNPs act as efficient vehicles to deliver a large quantity of silver ions to the interior of cells in a short period of time. Support for the hypothesis that AgNPs are simply carriers for Ag+ is provided by a study which showed that AgNPs are ineffective at slowing the growth of Ag+-resistant E. coli strains [217]. In addition, E. coli cells exposed to \u223c9 nm AgNPs [216] exhibited the same disruption to trans-membrane potentials and depleted ATP levels observed earlier [205] in E. coli cells exposed to AgNO3, albeit at absolute molar concentrations three orders of magnitude lower (\u03bcM vs. mM). Importantly, the bactericidal effect is clearly related to the chemical nature of silver, as similarly sized gold nanoparticles have no antimicrobial activity [228].",

[213], which showed that the concentration of Ag+ ions released from AgNPs under the tested conditions was too low to account completely for toxicity of AgNPs. More importantly, these authors were able to demonstrate that AgNPs bind to membrane proteins, forming pits and causing other morphological changes (Fig. 7\n); AgNPs were also found to react with the phosphorous groups of DNA. Morphological changes (pitting) in cellular membranes as a result of bacterial AgNP exposure were independently observed by Sondi and Salopek-Sondi [227], who further speculated that AgNP binding to membrane surfaces causes leeching of lipopolysacchrides and a subsequent loss of structural integrity and impermeability. The pitted membranes thus become more porous, which disrupts ion and molecular transport and also catalyzes the entry of additional AgNPs into the cellular interior where they can cause further damage to DNA and other cellular components.",

            "text": "Aside from differences in susceptibility between bacterial species (particularly between Gram-negative and Gram-positive specimens [228]), the quantitative toxicity of AgNPs to bacteria varies from study to study and appears to be dependent on numerous factors. For instance, studies have shown that the toxicity of AgNPs increase significantly as the nanoparticle diameter decreases [212], [213], [214], [217], [226], [241], [242] due to the fact that smaller nanoparticles have larger relative surface areas for Ag+ release, have higher protein binding efficiencies, and pass through pores in bacterial membranes more easily. Nanoparticle shape is also an important factor [218]: triangular AgNPs have better bactericidal properties against E. coli than spherical or rod-shaped particles, which is attributed to the variation in percentage of {1 1 1} vs. {1 0 0} surfaces\n5 present in nanoparticles of each respective shape (Fig. 7). It is thought that {1 1 1} surfaces have better binding efficiency to sulfur groups of cellular components [213]. AgNP surface charge [217], solubility and degree of agglomeration [217], [227], and surface coating [222], [224], [243] also influence the antimicrobial properties, and AgNPs may also act synergistically with other present chemicals (e.g., ampicillin) for amplified effect [225]. Unfortunately, in most studies AgNPs are poorly characterized and/or produced by methods which yield nanoparticles of highly nonuniform shape and size, which complicates the elucidation of important structure\u2013function relationships. Additionally, the specific proteins on various bacterial proteins that are more or less susceptible to AgNP reactivity are only recently beginning to be identified [224].",

Furthermore, that potency can be easily manipulated through the unique physical effects offered by nanomaterials. For instance, Akhaven and Ghaderi [244] showed that when silver nanowires are subjected to external electric fields, they have 18.5\u201363% better antimicrobial potency due to enhanced silver ion production at the wire termini. Also, photoexcitation of AgNPs coated with a thin (1\u20132 nm) layer of porous silica at visible light frequencies which are in resonance with AgNP surface plasmon bands has been shown by Fuertes et al. [245] to enhance antimicrobial activity against E. coli significantly, either through photosensitized ROS generation or photocatalyzed silver ion release; this effect is also reversible, providing a portal into photoswitchable antimicrobial behavior. Studies such as these imply that if intelligently-designed silver nanostructures are incorporated within food storage containers, the application of an external electric field or light source might be able to be used as a controllable and noninvasive sterilization method.",

For example, when the antimicrobial activity of an AgNP/SiO2 nanocomposite material was compared with that of a Ag zeolite and a AgNO3/SiO2 composite, the latter two materials had more (\u223c10\u00d7) potent acute antimicrobial responses yet the nancomposite allowed for a longer duration of activity [229]. Thus while a zeolite-based material might offer a superior immediate effect, the sustained antimicrobial activity of the nanocomposite would be better suited for the packaging of foods that require long transportation distances or storage times. Note that as in the case of \u201cbare\u201d AgNPs, the AgNP/SiO2 composite material was found to be effective against a broad spectrum of bacteria and fungi, was more effective against Gram-negative than Gram-positive bacteria, and could be incorporated within a PP polymer matrix for the creation of antibacterial films for food contact applications.",

            "text": "Numerous AgNP/polymer PNCs have been reported in the literature. Sanchez-Valdes et al., for example, coated a five layer (PE/tie/PA-6/tie/PE; PA-6 = polyamide six and tie = maleic anhydride grafted polyethylene) plastic film with an AgNP/polyethylene nanocomposite layer and found antimicrobial activity against the fungus A. niger, a common food contaminant [232]. Moreover, they found (see Fig. 8\n, top) that the activity was dependant on the coating method: methods that gave rise to a rougher surface (and hence more surface area for silver-ion release) had higher activity than those that resulted in a smoother surface. M\u00fcnstedt and coworkers published several studies on AgNP/PA-6 and /PP PNCs (AgNP particle size \u223c 800 nm) which possessed antimicrobial activity against E. coli and S. aureus as well the fungus C. albicans, polychaete worms (S. spirorbis), sea squirts (C. intestinalis) and algae (U. intestinalis) [249], [250], [251]. The antimicrobial activity was also found to be dependent on factors which affect silver ion release rate, such as degree of polymer crystallinity [249], filler type (i.e., silver particles, zeolites, etc.) [250], hydrophobicity of the matrix [251] and particle size (i.e., nanocomposite vs. microcomposite) [252]. Colloidal silver particles have also been coated 90\u2013150 nm thick onto paper using ultrasonic radiation, and this coated paper was shown to manifest excellent antimicrobial activity against E. coli and S. aureus, \u201csuggesting its potential application as a food packing material for longer shelf life\u201d [253]. Other AgNP/polymer PNCs exhibiting antimicrobial activity include versions in poly(acrylamide) [254], PVA [255], PVP [256], PE [257], PMMA [258], PU [259], PEO [260], alginate [261], soda-lime glass [262], silicone elastomer [247], cellulose [263], [264], [265], and chitosan [266], [267], [268], [269], [270], [271]. The chitosan-based materials are particularly interesting, as chitosan is a polysaccharide with natural antimicrobial properties, which suggests a cumulative antimicrobial effect is attainable. Moreover, chitosan films loaded with AgNPs have also been found to have better tensile and gas barrier properties than virgin films composed of the same material [268], [270]. Layer-by-layer assembly approaches have also been used to create antimicrobial Ag-based PNCs [266], [272] that have enhanced strength and mechanical properties.",

For instance, Mohammad-Fayaz et al. dipped sterilized carrots and pears into alginate solutions containing biosynthesized AgNPs, forming \u201cedible antibacterial films\u201d. They found that the treated carrots and pears had less water loss and higher consumer acceptability (judged on basis of color, texture and taste) over the course of 10 days (Fig. 8, bottom) [261]. In a similar study, fresh asparagus spears coated with AgNP/polyvinylpyrrolidone nanocomposite films had their shelf lives extended to 25 days when stored at 2 \u00b0C; in addition to having less weight loss, greener color and tenderer texture, coated asparagus also had less microorganism (psychotrophic bacteria, yeast and mold) growth during this time period [256]. An edible film based on AgNPs dispersed in glycogen has also been reported [273]. Chinese jujube fruit stored in food storage bags composed of AgNP/nanoparticulate TiO2/polyethylene films were firmer, heavier, and had less decay, less browning and slower ripening over a period of 12 days than fruit stored in control materials [257]. Orange juice stored at 4 \u00b0C in LDPE films incorporating P105 (TiO2 and 10 nm nanosilver mixture) power at 5% loading exhibited statistically significant reduction in Lactobacillus plantarum growth over a time period of 112 days [274]. In another kind of application, cellulose pads containing AgNPs generated from silver ions in situ have been shown to reduce the microbial levels of exudates from beef meat stored in modified atmosphere packaging [275], and fresh cut melon stored on AgNP-containing cellulose pads had lower microbial counts (mesophiles, psychrophiles and yeasts) and longer microbial growth lag times [265]. In addition, since silver particles catalyze the destruction of ethylene gas, fruits stored in the presence of AgNPs have slower ripening times and thus extended shelf lives [265].",

Titanium dioxide (TiO2) particles in particular are promising [276], [277], [278], [279], [280], [281], [282]. Unlike AgNPs, the antimicrobial activity of TiO2 nanoparticles is photocatalyzed and thus TiO2-based antimicrobials are only active in the presence of UV light. For instance, TiO2 nanoparticles have been found to be effective against common food-borne pathogens including Salmonella choleraesuis subsp., Vibrio parahaemolyticus, and L. monocytogenes under UV illumination but not in the dark [276]. Specifically targeting food-packaging materials, Cerrada et al. ultrasonically dispersed TiO2 nanoparticles throughout EVOH films and observed their effective photo-activated biocidal properties against nine microorganisms (bacteria and yeasts) cited to be involved in food poisoning and spoilage, some of the data for which are shown in Fig. 9\n[283]. Another food packaging study showed that polypropylene films coated with TiO2 nanoparticles inhibited E coli growth on fresh cut lettuce [284]. Several researchers have combined the antimicrobial properties of TiO2 nanoparticles with silver or AgNPs to create films or particles with enhanced antimicrobial activity [257], [285], [286]. In principle, food packaging films incorporating TiO2 nanoparticles may have the additional benefit of protecting food content from the oxidizing effects of UV irradiation while maintaining good optical clarity, as TiO2 nanoparticles are efficient short-wavelength light absorbers with high photostability; this approach to UV protection has already found traction in sunscreens [287], textiles [288], [289], [290] and wood varnishes [291], [292], although care must be taken as some forms of nanoparticulate titania may photocatalyze polymer oxidation and degradation.",

Several of these studies [300], [308], [309], [310], [313], [316] are targeted specifically at food or food packaging applications, and a recent publication reviewed the numerous classes of nanomaterial antimicrobials targeted for use in drinking water sterilization [325]. In another system, researchers replaced the sodium ions of montmorillonite nanoclays with silver ions and showed antimicrobial activity of these silver nanoclays when dispersed in poly(\u03b5-caprolactone) [326]; nanoclays modified with silver have also been dispersed in poly(lactic acid) to similar effect [327]. Note that complex nanoscale architectures with antibacterial activity have also been developed; for example, Ho et al. covalently attached vancomycin molecules to the surface of gold nanoparticles and showed that they have killing power more potent than vancomycin on its own, even against vancomycin-resistant bacterial strains [328], and Yang et al. functionalized lysozyme-coated polystyrene nanoparticles with selective antibodies and demonstrated efficient bactericidicity against the common food pathogen L. monocytogenes\n[329]. Finally, Bi et al. [330] loaded carbohydrate (phytoglycogen) nanoparticles with nisin (a broad-spectrum antimicrobial peptide produced by Lactococcus lactis during fermentation which is frequently used during the manufacture of processed cheeses, meats and beverages) and showed that they exhibit sustained antimicrobial activity against plated L. monocytogenes with efficacy that lasts several times longer than free nisin.",

Nanoscale silver particles are currently used in more manufacturer identified products than any other nanomaterial [185]. There are (as of August 2009) at least 259 products which utilize some form of nanosilver for their function [237], ranging from textiles (socks and linens) to cosmetics/hygiene products (toothpastes, make-ups), from appliances (washing machines and refrigerators) to cleaning agents (detergents, soaps), and from kitchen supplies (food storage containers, bakeware, cutting boards) to toys and building materials (paints, caulks, glues). Silver nanoparticles may also make an appearance in commercialized food packaging materials in the future. Unfortunately, the effect of this increase in the use of nanoscale silver on human health and the environment is unclear.",

It is, for example, still unclear to what extent the biochemical pathways which facilitate processing of silver ions apply to AgNPs, to what extent AgNPs pass through the intestinal lining intact or are dissolved into silver ions in the highly acidic environment of the stomach, and to what extent AgNPs can pass through natural biological barriers such as the blood\u2013brain barrier, the placenta or into breast milk. It is also crucial to note that regardless of one\u2019s interpretation of the available body of literature, there have been almost no attempts to study the cumulative effects of chronic AgNP exposure, and systematic investigations of the relationship between particle characteristics (size, shape, surface charge, etc.) and toxicity have yet to be performed. Furthermore, while one study was able to demonstrate that silver nanoparticles dispersed within electrospun PVA nanowhiskers were cytotoxic to epidermal keratinocytes and fibroblasts [331], very little is known about how the toxicity of silver or AgNPs is altered when these species are dispersed within plastic coatings. A review of in vitro and in vivo AgNP toxicological studies provides a more thorough analysis of this topic [332].",

            "text": "\nIn vitro toxicological studies have shown that AgNPs may not be benign to isolated mammalian cells. Human lung fibroblasts and glioblastoma cells exposed to AgNPs exhibit reduced ATP content, increased ROS production, damaged mitochondria, DNA damage and chromosomal aberrations in a dose-dependent manner compared to controls, suggesting that AgNPs have the potential to be cytotoxic, genotoxic, antiproliferative and possibly carcinogenic [333]. AgNPs at low concentrations in vitro cause changes to the cell cycle progression of human hepatoma cells, whereas at higher concentrations AgNPs induced abnormal cellular morphology, cell shrinkage, and chromosomal damage to a much worse extent than that caused by similar Ag+ concentrations, indicating that the toxicity of AgNPs is not only caused by Ag cation release [334]. Exposure of spermatogonial mouse stem cells to 15 nm AgNPs at low (10 \u03bcg/mL) levels in vitro results in cellular morphological changes and mitochondrial damage, etc., and thus AgNPs may represent a threat to male reproductive health under some conditions [335]. AgNPs also exhibit cytotoxicity to rat liver cells mediated through oxidative stress (e.g., disrupted membrane potentials, ROS formation etc.) at far lower concentrations than particles composed of other metals and metal oxides [336]; AgNP size-dependent cytotoxicity caused by oxidative stress and ROS formation was also demonstrated for rat alveolar macrophages [337]. While at least one AgNP-based dermatological ointment has been demonstrated to be cytotoxic to human fibroblasts and skin/carcinoma cells, causing concentration-dependent morphological changes, signs of oxidative stress, lipid oxidation, DNA fragmentation/apoptosis and, at very high concentrations, necrosis, it has nevertheless been concluded that AgNPs were safe for skin contact at concentrations up to 6.25 \u03bcg/mL [338]; however this dosage may be expected to be highly AgNP-size dependent, so the absolute usefulness of this mass-based dosage metric is debatable, particularly since the AgNP characteristics in this study were not disclosed. Despite these reports of AgNP cytotoxicity, some other studies have arrived at contrary conclusions: one group of researchers found that epidermal cells are unaffected by antimicrobial-relevant concentrations of AgNPs [223] and several groups have determined that AgNPs contained in LBL-assembled PNCs or bone-cements cause no observable toxic effects on human osteoblasts under the tested conditions [266], [272], [339].",

            "text": "It is important to keep in mind that in determining the health impact of a new food contact substance, toxicity information needs to be contextualized by a determination of how readily this substance can become released from packaging materials into various foods substances. Unfortunately, very little work has been done to assess the ability of nanoparticles in general, and AgNPs in particular, to migrate through rigid polymer environments and cross over the packaging/food interface. \u0160imon et al. [172] used a physicochemical approach to theorize that embedded AgNPs may diffuse from food packaging into foods at detectable levels only when the particle radius is very small (\u223c1 nm), when the packaging is comprised of a polymer with relative low dynamic viscosity (e.g., polyolefins such as LDPE, HDPE and PP), and when there are no significant interactions between the particles and the polymer. Though broad-scope experiments assessing this prediction have not yet been published, at least one study [274] has shown evidence of migration into a food substance, in this case orange juice, from LDPE packaging materials incorporating Ag or ZnO antimicrobial nanoparticles\n6. A more pressing concern, however, may be food contact materials in which the AgNPs are located on the material surface, such that they come into direct contact with the food matrix. In the aforementioned report of AgNPs being incorporated into cellulose pads for use in modified atmosphere packaging of fresh beef [275], for example, the authors found that detectable levels of silver ions leeched into the meat exudates (though not into the meat itself). Even so, systematic attempts to study relationships between particle characteristics, polymer type, food pH/polarity, and, especially, environmental conditions relevant to food production, storage and packaging use (e.g., temperature, pressure, humidity, light exposure and storage time) are decidedly lacking, making it difficult to broadly assess this important aspect of the safety of AgNP-based food contact materials at this time.",

In many studies particles were poorly characterized or not characterized at all, and the relationship between the effects of exposure observed in isolated cells in vitro and those in whole organisms is not always clear, particularly when questions remain about nanoparticle toxicology. Moreover, some studies go out of their way to sound controversial or to overstate the relevance of their findings. For example, one publication which has garnered some headlines demonstrated that AgNPs interfere with DNA replication during PCR cycles, as well as during reproduction in E. coli cells [344]. Yet the study\u2019s title (\u201cFood storage material silver nanoparticles interfere with DNA replication fidelity and bind with DNA.\u201d) implies that the article reports on a toxic effect in a consumer product, when in fact the article has nothing to do with food or food packaging at all. Thus scientists should make a heightened effort to stick to the facts and avoid hyperbolic titles, conclusions or prognostications wherever possible, so as to minimize the likelihood of misleading news agencies or the public about the safety of consumer products that contain nanomaterials.",

Many of these assays are based on observed color changes that occur to metal nanoparticle solutions in the presence of analytes. For example, gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) functionalized with cyanuric acid groups selectively bind to melamine (Fig. 10\n), an adulterant used to artificially inflate the measured protein content of pet foods and infant formulas; the melamine-induced aggregation causes AuNPs to undergo a reproducible, analyte-concentration-dependent color change from red to blue, which can be used to precisely measure the melamine content in raw milk and infant formula at concentrations as low as 2.5 ppb with the naked eye [345]. A similar approach examined test samples for the presence of melamine by adding in sequential fashion separate solutions of gold ions and a chemical reductant [346]. In this system, when melamine is present in a sample, it binds to the reductant and prevents AuNP formation; thus, test samples with no melamine turn fully red during the assay due to AuNP formation via reaction between the gold ions and the reductant. Colorimetric detection of melamine in raw milk using AuNPs and crown-ether-modified thiols with a limit of detection of 6 ppb has also been reported [347].",

            "text": "Electrochemical detection is another popular method by which nanomaterial-based sensors with applications in the food industry function; compared to optical (colorimetric or fluorimetric) methods, electrochemical approaches may be more useful for food matrices because the problem of light scattering and absorption from the various food components can be avoided. Many electrochemical sensors operate by binding selective antibodies to a conductive nanomaterial (e.g., carbon nanotube) and then monitoring changes to the material\u2019s conductivity when the target analyte binds to the antibodies. For example, conduction changes which occur when Microcystin-LR (MCLR), a toxin produced by cyanobacteria, binds to the surface of anti-MCLR-coated single-walled carbon nanotubes are easily detectable down to MCLR concentrations of 0.6 nM, which easily satisfies guidelines set by the World Health Organization for this substance in drinking water [363]; this technique improves the sampling time over traditional MCLR measurement methods (e.g., ELISA) by an order of magnitude. A similar strategy utilizing AuNPs and glucose-sensitive enzymes can be used to measure glucose concentrations in commercial beverages [364], and a reusable piezoelectric AuNP immunosensor has been developed which detects the presence of aflatoxin-B1\n7 in contaminated milk samples down to a concentration of 0.01 ng/mL [365]. Other electrochemical systems based on nanomaterials include: an immunosensor based on a cerium oxide nanoparticle and chitosan nanocomposite which detects ochratoxin-A, a food-borne fungal contaminant [366]; detection of staphylococcal enterotoxin B [367] and cholera-toxin [368] using silicon nanowire transistors and carbon nanotubes (CNTs), respectively; and detection and quantification of food colorants\n8 (Ponceau 4R and Allura Red in soft drinks [369] and Sudan 1 in ketchup or chili powder [370]) using CNTs and the concentration dependent intensity changes of the colorant-specific oxidation peaks. Note that analytes are not limited to harmful substances: one study showed that CNT-based electrochemical detection in microfluidic devices can be used to measure antioxidant, flavor compound and vitamin content in vanilla beans and apples [371]. Numerous other examples of electrochemical detection of various biomolecules using nanomaterials are provided in a recent review of the topic [372].",

Mills and coworkers, for example, have developed a promising photoactivated indicator ink for in-package oxygen detection based upon nanosized TiO2 or SnO2 particles and a redox-active dye (methylene blue) [375], [377], [378], [379], [380]; this detector gradually changes color in response to even minute quantities of oxygen, as shown in Fig. 11\n. While quantification of the oxygen content within food packages would be difficult with this technology, it nevertheless would provide consumers and retailers an easy, visual method to identify modified atmosphere packages (MAPs) with possible compromised seal integrity. One example of a sensor for moisture content, shown in Fig. 12\n, is based upon carbon-coated copper nanoparticles dispersed in a tenside film [376]. In humid environments, swelling of the polymer matrix results in larger degrees of inter-nanoparticle separation; these changes cause sensor strips to reflect or absorb different colors of light which can be monitored easily for quick and accurate determination of package moisture levels without invasive sampling. A noninvasive method of measuring carbon dioxide content in MAPs has also been devised, and is based upon lifetime analysis of luminescent dyes standardized by fluorophore-encapsulated polymer nanobeads [381]; notably, this CO2 sensor has a detection range of 0.8\u2013100%, a resolution of 1%, and only 0.6% cross-sensitivity with molecular oxygen.",

Though some all-optical methods have been devised, such as one which used two-photon Rayleigh scattering in conjunction with antibody-conjugated gold nanoparticles to selectively detect E. coli\n[396], most detection strategies in real food systems require isolation of the target organism from the surrounding environment to ensure that signal-to-noise ratios are sufficiently large to observe. Often, a technique known as immunomagnetic separation (IMS) is used to satisfy this requirement (e.g., [397]). IMS uses magnetic particles attached to selective antibodies in combination with a magnet to selectively separate the target analyte from the food matrix prior to detection. Nanoscale magnetic particles are especially useful in this regard due to their extremely high surface-to-volume ratios, which facilitate large analyte capture efficiencies. Captured analytes can then be easily purified and subjected to standard measurement techniques. This approach is illustrated graphically in Fig. 13\n. For instance, attachment of antibodies selective for L. monocytogenes onto functionalized, magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles can be used to efficiently separate the target bacteria from artificially contaminated milk and detect them using real-time PCR analysis [398]. A similar approach has been used to isolate E. coli from freshly ground beef with >94% capture efficiency and no interference from other tested bacterial species [399].",

The general idea is that not only can the nanoscale magnetic particles be used to bind and isolate analytes from the matrix, but they (or other nanomaterials which constitute parts of multi-component systems) can also be directly detected without the need for time-consuming biological assays. This is particularly easy with microbial detection because the small size of nanoparticles relative to those of the target organisms causes large, readily observable electrical/optical property modulations before and after binding events. It is also worth pointing out that nanomaterials lend themselves well to multiplexing assays, as in the case of a barcode-style method which utilizes binding of selective antibodies to specific regions of magnetic (and nonmagnetic) multi-metal nanowires for the simultaneous, multiplexed optical detection of bacteria, viruses and protein-based toxins [400].",

For instance, one research group used sugar molecules attached to nanosized magnetic iron oxide particles to isolate up to 88% of E. coli in a sample with only a 45 min incubation time [403]; the E. coli were subsequently detected using fluorescent staining. Irudayaraj and coworkers improved upon this approach by using species- and strain-specific antibodies instead of sugar molecules to isolate and optically detect (bench top FTIR/ portable mid-IR) the target organisms in 2% milk and spinach extract [404]. In a separate series of studies, they used magnetic nanoparticles in conjunction with gold nanorods (AuNRs) to separate and detect key food-borne bacteria; here, the magnetic particles facilitate separation while the AuNRs are used for optical detection in the near-infrared. Notably, because AuNRs have length-dependant absorptive properties and efficient light-to-heat energy conversion, they offer the possibility of multiplexed detection (i.e., simultaneous detection of multiple organisms) as well as efficient photoactivated antimicrobial activity via thermal ablation, all from a single multi-component entity [405], [406]. Optical colorimetric detection and thermal ablation of Salmonella using oval-shaped AuNPs has also been demonstrated [407]. With this in mind, is also worth pointing out that nanomaterials can be useful for the rapid detection of microorganisms after IMS, even IMS performed using conventionally-sized magnetic particles: as an example, Su and Li used IMS to separate E. coli from test samples and semiconductor nanocrystals (quantum dots) as fluorescent tags [408]. Their protocol offered a detection range of 103\u2013107 CFU/mL and total detection time of only 2 h, compared with 18\u201324 h for traditional bacterial plating/incubation methods.",

Though Raman spectroscopy has numerous advantages over infrared for molecular identification, a significant disadvantage is that Raman scattering is an extremely weak effect, which limits its usefulness in diagnostic applications. However, it was discovered in the 1970s that roughened metal surfaces can greatly (typically in the range of 4\u20137 orders of magnitude) increase the Raman peak intensity of analyte molecules in their general proximity. Though the physical origin of surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) is still a matter of some scientific debate, it is known that the effect is at least partially caused by interaction of molecular electronic states with localized electric fields generated by photoexcitation of metal surface plasmons. Because of orientation requirements between the molecular transitions and the plasmon oscillations, SERS enhancement is greatest on surfaces with large degrees of curvature or \u201croughness\u201d. As a result, nanoscale metal structures, such as those comprised of gold or silver, give rise to the most enhanced, and thus practically useful, SERS signals for characterization and detection of analytes.",

In (a) the package is freshly sealed and both indicators are blue. The photograph in (b) shows the indicators immediately after activation with UVA light. After a few minutes, the indicator outside of the package returns to a blue color, whereas the indicator in an oxygen-free atmosphere remains white (c) until the package is opened, in which case the influx of oxygen causes it to change back to blue (d). This system could be used to easily and noninvasively detect the presence of leaks in every package immediately after production and at retail sites.

(a) Antibodies selective for specific bacterial strains or species (e.g., E. coli) are bound to the surfaces of magnetic nanoparticles (e.g., Fe2O3). Only the targeted organisms will bind to the functionalized magnetic nanoparticles. (b) A complex matrix (e.g., food, blood, milk, etc.) contains the target analyte as well as numerous potential interferences, such as other bacterial species, viruses, proteins, food or blood particles, etc. Functionalized magnetic nanoparticles are added to the matrix, where they bind selectively and with high capture efficiency to the target analyte. A magnetic field isolates the analyte-bound magnetic particles, after which the supernatant is then carefully decanted. The remaining material is then subjected to quantification assays. In more sophisticated systems, the magnetic nanoparticles themselves are the means of detection and quantification (see text).",

Both spectra were acquired under identical Raman instrumental conditions. Note that the spectral intensity for CV on the SERS substrate is effectively 4 \u00d7 107 times larger than that of the conventional Raman experiment. Because each chemical compound exhibits a different spectral fingerprint, SERS can be used to quickly and accurately detect a wide range of food contaminents, including living organisms.
