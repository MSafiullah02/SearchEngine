Because prognostication by physician clinical judgment is vulnerable to myriad cognitive biases [2] and prone to error [3, 4], and because the extreme psychological burdens of this approach to allocation of life-saving resources should be avoided, there is an important potential role for prognostic models. Prognostic models can offer actuarial objectivity for critical decision-making, ameliorating the influence of human biases. Many Covid-specific models have already been developed, although an early review indicates they have a high risk of bias [5]. In this viewpoint, we highlight methodological aspects of prediction that are of special relevance for allocating life-preserving interventions and have received little attention in more general methodological guidance for clinical prediction modeling [6, 7]. We believe the considerations we note may be underappreciated, as they do not apply (or may be less salient) in more typical clinical contexts that employ prediction for shared decision-making with patients.",

In that context, \u2018good calibration\u2019 (i.e. agreement between the proportion of patients predicted to have an outcome in any strata and those that actually have that outcome) is critical for effective decision-making. Yet excellent calibration\u2014normally the Achilles heel of prediction, since it requires consistent effects of variables not included in the model [12, 13]\u2014is not a critical issue for microallocation. When the goal is to prioritize patients for scarce resources that would benefit a much larger group, (non-parametric) ranking (i.e. good discrimination) is key. This is because, under conditions of scarcity, the decision threshold is not determined by a patient\u2019s (or clinician\u2019s) point of indifference (the risk at which the utilities of alternative treatments or decisions are evenly balanced), but by capacity.

For example, age and sex are important determinants of actuarial functions, such as mortality risk and life expectancy, which may provide a basis for microallocation. If each year of life is valued similarly for all, clinical prediction will systematically prioritize treatment for the young over the old and presumably, in Covid-19 infection, for women over men. It is also not hard to see how such actuarial functions might differentially allocate resources across different racial or ethnic groups\u2014given influential social determinants of health and other race-correlated factors\u2014which might disadvantage historically marginalized groups. These fairness concerns may be exacerbated by machine learning approaches that are (1) highly dimensional (potentially making use of many variables that might function as proxies for race, ethnicity or sex) and (2) not open to scrutiny by clinicians, regulators or the general public. The field of algorithmic fairness has generated interesting scholarly work, but is not fully mature for application in this crisis [14].",
