This article, therefore, presents a critical review of hand sanitation approaches and products available on the market in light of the scientific evidence available to date.

To put these numbers into context, comparison between the search on \"hand sanitizer\" to that of the words \"pill\", \"drug\" and \"medicine\" was done in Figure 1B . Results show that before the spread of the new coronavirus, these words were constantly googled 25-50 times more frequently than \"hand sanitizers\", while during the peak of the pandemic (March 2020), \"hand sanitizers\" was searched approximately twice as much as those keywords. Although, the astonishing peak of searches on \"hand sanitizer\" is moderately tapering down, it is expected that the interest in this topic will remain much higher than the prepandemic levels, because, until a vaccine against CoViD-19 will be made available, hand sanitisation will remain at the forefront of infection prevention measures. Moreover, it is reasonable to speculate that the current awareness of the general public of the importance of hand disinfection will remain assimilated and will become an integral part of people's hygiene practices, even post-CoViD-19 era.",

As academics and pharmacists working in pharmaceutical technology departments of schools of pharmacy, we have received a high number of requests related to hand sanitisers, spanning from other faculties and businesses requesting the production of hand sanitisers in our laboratories, to pharmacists asking for advice on the compounding of such products. Indeed, hand sanitisers can also be prepared extemporaneously in pharmacies; however, pharmacists need an appropriate formulation and manufacturing directions to ensure a consistent product with adequate quality. Consumer habits and patterns are rapidly reshaping under the CoViD-19 crisis (McKenzie, 2020) and the unprecedented demand of hand sanitisers is likely to remain as the \"new normal\" for an extended period of time. We, therefore, aim to provide in this article a technical perspective on the functionality and development of alcohol-based hand sanitiser formulations.",

CoViD-19 has then rapidly spread around the world and was declared as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) . As of 14 th April 2020, around two million people have contracted the disease, and over 125 thousand deaths have been attributed to CoViD-19 globally (CSSE, 2020) .

Among these supplies, stocks of hand sanitisers have rapidly vanished from some markets, as soon as the frequent handwashing and sanitisation was recommended by the public health agencies across the world. According to a market research from Nielsen, the sale of hand sanitisers skyrocketed by 300% and 470% in the last week of February and first week of March 2020, respectively, in comparison to the same time in the previous year (Huddleston, 2020) . Similarly, in Italy -one of the most affected countries by CoViD-19 -sales of hand sanitisers in supermarkets augmented by 561% during the first three weeks of the pandemic (24 th February-15 th March 2020) compared to the previous year (Ufficio Studi Coop, 2020) .

Google Trends analyse and compare the search volume of given keywords on Google. Figure 1A shows the trend of the search of the keyword \"hand sanitizer\" (American English spelling) within the United States. A fairly constant volume of Google searches on this topic was shown until February 2020, when a massive spike of 100-fold increase in interest in \"hand sanitizer\" appeared. This finding correlated with the increased search of the word \"CoViD-washing the hands with soap and water, rather than to use the ABHR, whenever possible. This is because hand washing can virtually remove all types of pathogens, while the hand sanitiser can effectively kill 99.9% of germs (e.g. less effective with Cryptosporidium, norovirus, and Clostridium difficile). Moreover, in case of extremely greasy or dirty hands, ABHR effectiveness is reduced due to poor penetration of the product through the layer of dirt in soiled hands. In contrast, the detergents in a hand wash enable deeper cleaning and higher removal of germs. Moreover, potentially harmful substances can only be washed by a soap and water rather than hand sanitisation using ABHRs.",

It is however important to emphasise that ABHRs only work when used correctly. Thus, considering that not all ABHR formulations are the same, appropriate labelling is important in directing the correct dose/amount needed to achieve an adequate sanitisation (Hadaway, 2020) .

An analysis of some currently marketed products (discussed later in section 5) reveals indeed that ABHRs, sold in Italian pharmacies as biocides, contain percentages of ethanol between 62% and 74% (w/w)/(70% to 80% v/v). This goes in line with the standard WHO, US FDA and CDC guidelines (Boyce et al., 2009; CDC, 2019a; FDA, 2020 FDA, , 1994 . It is worth highlighting that ethanol, unlike water, has a density < 1 g/cm 3 , which means that percentages of ethanol in water by weight (w/w) and by volume (v/v) can be significantly different and must be specified on the label. A useful comparison between percentages by weight and by volume of ethanol in ABHRs is reported in a recently published document (BDC, 2020) . Although this concept might seem trivial, there are cases of published works, where the concentration expression (either w/w or v/v) was not specified, as indicated by Kampf (G Kampf, 2018) , ultimately presenting ambiguous information. In research work, compounding and manufacturing, it is recommended to clearly specify the concentration units of alcohol used in ABHRs.",

It was noted that definitive claims on the effectivity of various disinfectants against SARS-CoV-2 cannot be made, simply because this is a new virus and the range of off-the-shelf ABHRs has never been tested for SARS-CoV-2. Like other respiratory viruses, the new coronavirus is known to spread mainly from person-to-person through airborne droplets (CDC, 2020) . Moreover, the information about the virus survival on surfaces and the environment is still limited (Jansen, 2020) . It has, however, been indicated that SARS-CoV-2 can also be transmitted through surfaces, as it can survive for a long period of time on various materials;",

Thus, liquid formulations can leave suboptimal doses of disinfectants on the hands, potentially leading to decrease in product efficacy (Greenaway et al., 2018) . For the consumer market, gel formulations are more portable and convenient to dispense on-the-go due to their ease of use and low risk of spillage compared to liquid-based products. Gel-based formulations also reduce the evaporation rate of alcohol and help alcohol to spread and penetrate through contaminating organisms (Fu et al., 2020; Howes, 2020) . Gels can be obtained by incorporating viscosity enhancer excipients in the formulation. A huge variety of thickening agents for the pharmaceutical, cosmetic and food industry are available. Although the performance of these substances is well characterised in aqueous media, little is known about their behaviour in hydroalcoholic solvents.",

The only reference available is from Brown et al. who compared the viscosity of 10% CMC (the type and MW is not specified) in pure water and hydroalcoholic mixtures (up to 40% ethanol). A remarkable increase in the viscosity was observed from pure water (G' 432 Pa) to a mixture containing 30% ethanol (G'1,186 Pa), followed by a drop (G' 671 Pa) at 40% ethanol which may be attributed to the poor solubility of CMC in higher alcoholic media (Brown et al., 1998) .",

Physical and chemical properties., 2017; Lubrizol, 1998) . For carbomer thickeners, it is necessary to raise the pH to around 6.5-7 with the neutralising agent. The neutralising agent has to be added dropwise or gradually after the complete dispersion of the polymer, possibly monitoring the pH with a pH-meter (using electrodes suitable for measuring viscous or dirty samples) or a pH-indicator paper. Gel preparation using this procedure is faster with the surface-treated grades of thickeners such as Carbopol\u00ae Ultrez types for carbomer or Natrosol R-grades for HPC, due to the low lumpiness of these polymers when dispersed [for carbomer Ultrez grades the direct method should be slightly modified -for more details readers are referred to (Lubrizol, 1998) ]. Also, all carbomer thickeners are faster to disperse than the others due to their pHdependent viscosity. They remain in the liquid phase during product preparation until the pH is adjusted to neutral. This is an advantage as solvent diffusion and polymer hydration are much more rapid in liquid state than in an already formed gel system. On the other hand, the direct addition method can be slower and more difficult for HPMC and HPC gels (even for surface-treated grades), due to their high tendency to form lumps during dispersion. The direct addition method is a very effective and economical procedure, as long as an efficient stirring system is available for production.",

The wetting procedure is usually operated using mortar and pestle.

The addition of the neutralising agent for carbomer polymers follows the same procedure reported in the direct addition method.

Interestingly, these three hand gels were among the ones on which we performed the rheological analysis (Table 1) , whereby they showed different rheological behaviour compared to most other analysed products. The product containing HEC was practically liquid, with a white precipitate at the bottom, that could be explained by a decreased polymer solubility at high ethanolic concentration. Indeed, the manufacturer of HEC indicates that this polymer possesses good solubility in hydroalcoholic media containing up to 60% ethanol (Ashland, 2018b) , hinting at a decrease in polymer solubility at higher ethanolic concentrations. As for the carbomer gel neutralised with sodium hydroxide, it was slightly opaque and less viscous compared to the majority of the carbomer products (Table 1) . Noteworthily, sodium hydroxide is not recommended as a suitable neutralising agent for carbomer-based hydroalcoholic gels by the manufacturer, due to possible polymer precipitation (Lubrizol, 2002) , as stated earlier.

It is prepared by the reaction of ethylene oxide with cellulose in the presence of sodium hydroxide under controlled conditions. Each glucose unit of the cellulose backbone contains three hydroxyl groups capable of reaction. If all three hydroxyl groups of each glucose residue react, the theoretical degree of substitution (DS) would be 3, although this is not practically achievable. The introduced hydroxyethyl groups can, indeed, react again with the free ethylene oxide at basic conditions, giving a side chain containing a different number of hydroxyethyl groups. To account for this, the total molar substitution (MS) describes the average number of ethylene oxide molecules attached to each glucose residue. HEC with DS and MS of 1.5 and 2.5 respectively, is known as Natrosol\u2122 250. Natrosol\u2122 250 is available in a range of molecular weight grades (L, M, H, HH) differing in their aqueous viscosity, where the L, M, H, HH",

The label claims on the product determine the choice of the regulation market. If the product is used to cleanse or clean the skin, then the it is subjected to the Cosmetic Products Regulation. While if the use of the product aims at disinfecting the skin from potentially infectious organisms, or if the action of the product goes beyond the general use of personal hygiene, then the hand sanitiser should follow the Biocidal Products Regulation. The marketing authorisation procedures and labelling requirements significantly differ between the two regulatory pathways. Specifically, a biocide has to be authorised by a competent authority (National Health Authority or European Commission) after the evaluation of a dossier containing all the information regarding the safety and effectiveness of the product. The product label must report the concentration of the \"active ingredient\" (including alcohol), the uses for which the product is authorised including all warnings, hazard and precautionary statements. On the other hand, evidence of safety is the key requirement for a cosmetic product. For the market authorisation, the company has to notify the Product Information File (PIF) to the cosmetic products notification portal (CPNP), which makes the information electronically available to competent authorities or poison centres. The product label must contain the list of ingredients (in descending order of weight), particular precautions or warnings and the cosmetic activity unless it is clear from its presentation.",

For each category, the cross-linking density can be low, medium, or high, providing polymers with a varying ability to increase the viscosity of aqueous systems. The \"traditional\" carbomers are still synthesised in benzene, a toxic solvent that cannot be used for pharmaceutical applications. The pharmaceutical-grade carbomers are synthesised in either ethyl acetate or a mixture of ethyl acetate and cyclohexane.
