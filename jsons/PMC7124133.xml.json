            "text": "Since CRISPR/Cas9 was discovered, CRISPR/Cas systems attracted much attention and CRISPR toolbox had been continuously expanded. As a potent complement to DNA targeting CRISPR toolbox, CRISPR/Cas12a (previously known as CpfI), a Class 2 type V CRISPR/Cas effector, was characterized (Zetsche et al., 2015) with the capability to efficiently cleave target double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) guided by a crRNA. Moreover, differing from Cas9, Cas12a possessed a target-dependent nonspecific single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) cutting activity (Chen et al., 2018). Beyond dsDNA, ssRNA molecules could also be edited by another Cas protein, CRISPR/Cas13a (previously known as C2c2) (Abudayyeh et al., 2016). Cas13a, as a class 2 type VI CRISPR effector, was programmed to cleave the target RNA guided by crRNA. In addition, as an expanded RNA-targeting CRISPR toolbox, Cas13a owned the property for target-activated degradation of non-target RNA molecules (East-Seletsky et al., 2016). In 2018, a serial of smaller size of CRISPR/Cas14 effectors (Cas14a, Cas14b and Cas14c) were reported (Harrington et al., 2018), with the highly selective cleavage preference for ssDNA. Moreover, Cas14 possessed a target-dependent indiscriminate ssDNA cutting activity. Subsequently, CRISPR toolbox was further expanded with newly developed CRISPR/Cas systems, including Cas12b (Shmakov et al., 2015; Teng et al., 2018; Strecker et al., 2019; Teng et al., 2019), Cas12c, Cas12g, Cas12h, Cas12i (Yan et al., 2019) and Cas13d (Konermann et al., 2018; Yan et al., 2018). Recently, the emerging CRISPR tools had been developed abundantly for the application of nucleotide detection.",

            "text": "A class of CRISPR/Cas tools for nucleotide detection is based on the specific binding and cutting activity of CRISPR/Cas9 (Fig. 1A). Pardee et al. reported a method for detection of Zika virus (Pardee et al., 2016). This study showed that the detecting capability and specificity dramatically enhanced in combination with CRISPR/Cas9. In the presence of CRISPR/Cas9, this platform could discriminate single-nucleotide resolution between various genotypes of Zika virus. In 2018, a Cas9-based nucleotide detection tool termed CAS-EXPAR (Cas9 triggered exponential amplification reaction) was developed. Combined with exponential amplification reaction, CAS-EXPAR could detect the target at concentration as low as 0.82 amol (0.82 \u00d7 10\u221218 mol/L) (Huang et al., 2018). Subsequently, this technology was optimized to monitor methylation status of DNA fragment. The changes of DNA methylation showed strong correlation with disease such as cancer (Field et al., 2018). CAS-EXPAR provided a versatile option for detection of primitive or methylated DNA molecules, an ideal method for early diagnosis of tumors. Recently, many other Cas9-based detection tools were constantly developed (Zhang et al., 2018; Zhou et al., 2018). The nuclease-deactivated mutant Cas9 (dCas9) was able to bind target DNA without cutting activity. Wang et al. developed a microRNA (miRNA) sensor consisting of dCas9, miRNA-mediated sgRNA and red fluorescent protein (Wang et al., 2019). This sensor provided an exquisite example to measure miRNA activity and track cell-state transition, so that the activity of miRNA in stem cell differentiation and cancer progression could be timely monitored (Wang et al., 2019).",

In combination of the target-dependent indiscriminate RNA cutting activity of Cas13a with recombinase polymerase amplification, Cas13a-based SHERLOCK (specific high sensitivity enzymatic reporter UnLOCKing) was developed (Gootenberg et al., 2017) with attomolar (10\u221218 mol/L) sensitivity for detecting Zika or Dengue viruses. Strikingly, SHERLOCK, as a CRISPR based platform, had shown single-molecule sensitivity for nucleotide detection. The emergence of high sensitivity, convenience and low cost of SHERLOCK shed light on the way for nucleotide detection based on collateral effect of CRISPR/Cas system. However, a drawback of SHERLOCK made it unsuitable for quantitative detection (Gootenberg et al., 2017). Shortly afterwards, it was upgraded to SHERLOCK version 2 (SHERLOCKv2) (Gootenberg et al., 2018) with four channels to detect multiple targets in single reaction. The 3.5 times more sensitivity, as well as the quantitative, potable and visual readout made SHERLOCKv2 a powerful tool for nucleic acid detection. When paired with HUDSON (heating unextracted diagnostic samples to obliterate nucleases), SHERLOCK could directly detect Zika and Dengue viruses from bodily fluids of patients (Myhrvold et al., 2018).",

An updated version HOMLSv2, combined of Cas12b and isothermal amplification, was developed subsequently to detect nucleotide, discriminate SNP, quantify DNA and DNA methylation degree (Li et al., 2019). Unlike DETECTR, which was designed for qualitative measurement only, HOLMES could be utilized for quantitative detection.

The recent emergence of Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by a novel ssRNA virus, has led to serious harm to human health worldwide. Nucleic acid detection played an important role in the diagnosis of COVID-19. Currently, molecular diagnosis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) had been mainly based on Real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), which required expensive equipment and was time-consuming. Moreover, frequent false-negative results from qPCR seriously had delayed the treatment of patients and the prevention and control of COVID-19. In contrast, CRISPR-based tools showed better superiority for nucleotide detection because they were faster, cheaper, more sensitive and accurate within similar workload. Luckily, CRISPR-based detection methods for SARS-CoV-2 had been developed recently (Metsky et al., 2020), making it suitable for molecular diagnosis of this epidemic outbreak. Meanwhile, a rapid SHERLOCK based detection platform of SARS-CoV-2 had also been developed by Feng Zhang\u2019s laboratory that could be completed in one hour.",

The advantages of CRISPR tools including high sensitivity, convenience and low cost show great potentials to replace existing outdated techniques for GMO detection. In combination of Cas9 with rolling circle amplification and gold nanoparticles, CRISPR-based method for plant pathogens could visually detect target DNA at concentration as low as 2 pmol/L (10\u221212 mol/L), which could provide a convenient platform for crops inspection (Chang et al., 2019). Furthermore, a modified version of SHERLOCK, designed to detect multiple soybean genes in one single reaction has been recently developed to monitor the traits of crops during breeding (Abudayyeh et al., 2019). African swine fever (ASF), caused by infection of African swine fever virus (ASFV), becomes an infectious disease with high fatality rate in most pig farms. The point-of-care detection by farmers is of great significance for the prevention and diagnosis of ASF. At present, the detection of ASFV is mainly based on qPCR, which is time-consuming and requires equipping expensive instruments. To improve this situation, Cas12 and Cas14-based detection method for ASFV has been developed to target three key genes of ASFV (VP72, K205 R, CP530R). It could visually detect ASFV from pig secretions such as blood, urine and nasal swab within 15 min (unpublished data). We can envision the prospects of broad applications of CRISPR-based detecting systems in the agriculture, especially the on-site evaluation of transgenosis of genetically modified foods and more infectious animal diseases in the near future.",

By combining with Csm6, a CRISPR type III protein, the sensitivity of signal detection could be further elevated (Gootenberg et al., 2018). The detection platforms with additional lateral flow for visual readout show significant improvement for the control of the spread of infectious diseases, especially in certain areas without essential instruments for molecular diagnostics.
