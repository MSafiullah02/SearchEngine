            "text": "\nAtopy, or the genetic predisposition to produce antigen-specific IgE after exposure to an allergen, is a common component of atopic diseases, such as asthma, allergic rhinitis, food allergy, and atopic dermatitis. In addition, pathogenic factors common to allergic disorders include acute and chronic inflammation involving mast cells, basophils, allergen-specific T cells, and activated eosinophils. Many of the genes for the cytokines and receptors that regulate allergic inflammation are clustered on a short segment of chromosome 5q, and linkage of total serum IgE levels to these genes has been demonstrated in some kindreds.52 In contrast, production of IgE specific for many of the common pollen and pet allergens has been linked to certain human leukocyte antigen (HLA) Class II molecules located on chromosome 6.37 These data indicate that the inheritance of allergic disorders is multifactorial. Furthermore, there appear to be additional factors that influence whether a person born into an atopic family will develop allergic rhinitis, asthma, atopic dermatitis, or some combination of these disorders. For example, Dold et al found that families that included one parent with atopic dermatitis were more likely to have a child with atopic dermatitis (odds ratio [OR] 3.4) than were families with one parent with either asthma (OR 1.5) or allergic rhinitis (OR 1.4).14 Similar trends were observed when inheritance of asthma or atopic dermatitis was examined, and these findings suggest that there are specific genetic or environmental factors that influence which organ system(s) are affected by allergy. In support of this concept, genes within chromosome 5q and elsewhere have been linked to the development of bronchial hyperresponsiveness, a key feature of asthma.70\n",

Although this paradigm has received criticism for its simplicity in terms of the overall immune cytokine network,35 many groups have considered it as a useful starting point in unraveling the pathogenesis of allergic inflammation.93 The Th-2 pattern of response has been found in tissue samples obtained at sites of allergic or parasitic inflammation, whereas the Th-1 response has been more associated with delayed hypersensitivity and response to virus infections.

Various investigators have noted that this Th-2 polarization is established during infancy and early childhood56, 106; indeed, some have noted that diminished IFN-\u03b3 production can be demonstrable in cord blood of infants at high risk of developing allergic disease based on parental histories of atopy.89 Perhaps most importantly, infants with this type of IFN-\u03b3 profile have a significantly increased risk of going on to develop atopic diseases including both eczema and asthma.",

Because IFN-\u03b3 production appears to be abnormal in a number of studies,24, 32, 89, 92 regulation of this cytokine has been evaluated. Two cytokines, IL-12 and IL-18 (IFN-\u03b3 inducing factor), are potent stimulators of IFN-\u03b3 production.66, 91 Interestingly, cord blood mononuclear cells have been noted to produce less IL-12 mRNA and protein compared with adult cells, but IFN-\u03b3 production in response to IL-12 was similar.47 Therefore, alterations in IFN-\u03b3 production in the developing infant and child may be a reflection, at least in part, in cytokine regulation of its production. Furthermore, it has been noted that atopic asthmatic patients have a deficient IL-12 response when whole blood cultures are stimulated with a strain of Staphylococcus aureus.94 Taken together, these findings suggest that the observed decreases in IFN-\u03b3 production in atopic patients may be related to abnormalities in positive regulatory signals, such as IL-12.",

Sensitization to respiratory allergens rarely occurs before 2 years of age, and positive skin tests for indoor allergens such as house dust mite and cat proteins usually precede the development of pollen allergy by several years. This temporal sequence suggests that prolonged contact of high concentrations of allergens with mucosal surfaces provides optimal conditions for allergen sensitization to occur, and this observation has been substantiated in animal models of allergy.",

First, several cases have been reported in which young infants have developed allergic reactions upon their first ingestion of a specific food protein. Considering that IgE does not cross the placenta, one potential explanation for this phenomenon is that sensitization in utero via traces of antigenic proteins that circulate in the maternal circulation cross the placenta and sensitize fetal lymphocytes. To test this hypothesis, several studies have been conducted to detect neonatal allergen sensitization. In support of this, Warner et al demonstrated allergen-specific proliferative responses in cord blood lymphocytes.99 Although the latter findings suggest that fetal lymphocytes can be activated by allergenic proteins in the maternal circulation, positive responses do not necessarily indicate allergy, and these activated lymphocytes could just as well be cells involved in tolerance. In older children, positive lymphocyte responses to allergens can be found in both allergic and nonallergic individuals and have not been found to be useful discriminators of allergy. Additional research is needed to clarify the significance and predictive value of lymphocyte responses in newborns.",

Smoking causes lower birth weights and corresponding reductions in lung size, and small lung size has been identified as a risk factor for wheezing lower respiratory illnesses in infancy.57 In addition to decreasing lung size, in utero exposure to tobacco smoke has been shown to reduce newborn lung function. To measure this effect, techniques have been developed to measure pulmonary function during resting tidal breathing in babies and infants at a very early age. The outcome variable that has been used most often to study the effects of tobacco on infant pulmonary function is the time to peak tidal expiratory flow as a proportion of the total expiratory time (TPTEF:TE); this index measures slowing of expiration by the combination of glottic narrowing and diaphragmatic tone and is reduced in adults with obstructive airway disease.59 Using these techniques, mild airway obstruction has been detected in infants born to smoking mothers within 3 days of birth, strongly suggesting that smoking causes reduced pulmonary function in the developing fetus.50, 85 This concept is further supported by a study of Hoo et al,36 who evaluated pulmonary function prior to discharge in 108 preterm infants, 40 of whom were born to mothers who smoked during pregnancy. In this study, decreased TPTEF:TE was associated with exposure to tobacco smoke in utero, but not birth weight or length, and this relationship persisted in the multivariate analysis. Together, these studies provide compelling evidence that maternal cigarette smoking can harm developing lungs both before and after birth, and these effects are likely to contribute to increasing the risk of developing wheezing with viral infections and chronic asthma.",

The intervention consisted of maternal avoidance of milk, egg, and wheat, with limited soy and wheat intake during lactation and breast-feeding. In addition, infants in the intervention group were breast-fed or given a casein hydrolysate formula until 12 months of age. Solid foods were introduced starting at age 6 months, but egg protein was withheld until 24 months of age or older, and peanut and fish were started after 36 months of age. Children in the intervention group had less atopic dermatitis and food allergy at 1 year of age (Fig. 2)\n, and allergy to cow's milk was reduced through 2 years of age. By age 7, there were no group-specific differences in the period prevalence of eczema and food allergy. Because of effects before the age of 2 years, the cumulative prevalence of food allergy remained lower at age 7, suggesting that the interventions did more than just delay the onset of food allergy and actually prevented some cases.

Although the numerous studies in the interim have so far failed to resolve this issue,45 several points are clear. First, because of multiple beneficial effects on growth, development, and the immune system, breast milk is the ideal infant diet98 and should be advocated regardless of the allergic history of the family. Second, food proteins consumed by the mother can be detected in breast milk, and this low level (nanogram quantities) of food protein is sufficient to cause allergen sensitization and to induce allergic symptoms in a subset of allergy-prone infants. Excluding highly allergenic foods such as cow's milk and egg from maternal diet during lactation can reduce the infant's risk of food allergy and eczema and provides a preventive strategy for highly allergic families.",

This concept is especially intriguing when one considers the temporal sequence of this process: The early exposure to allergenic proteins initiates a process that is not clinically evident for several years because pollen allergy is rarely diagnosed until children have reached school age. These findings, along with data derived from experimental models of sensitization in animals, suggest that early exposure to inhaled proteins initiate allergen-specific T-cell responses, but additional elements in the immune system, such as dendritic cells or other antigen-presenting cells, must mature before allergy to these proteins can develop.33 Alternately, the initial allergen-specific T-cell responses may require repeated restimulation, and the intermittent nature of pollen exposure could explain why hay fever takes longer to develop compared with allergy to either foods or perennial inhalants.",

Finally, Sporik et al conducted a large prospective study in which dust mite protein levels were measured in a large cohort of homes in the United Kingdom.83 In this study, the degree of exposure to house dust mite protein during infancy was to an earlier onset of symptoms in children with asthma. Together, these studies provide evidence of a close epidemiologic relationship between house dust mite exposure and childhood asthma and imply a cause and effect relationship, suggesting that if house dust mite exposure could be controlled or eliminated, there would be less asthma. Enthusiasm for this approach has been tempered, however, by subsequent studies that demonstrated comparable or greater prevalences of allergic rhinitis and asthma in humid environments, where dust mites flourish, and in desert or inner city environments, where exposure to house dust mite protein is reduced or absent.26, 77, 84\n",

Epidemiologic evidence linking increased rates of allergy and asthma to the inner city environment, and even the proximity of the home to major highways, suggests that air pollution enhances allergic sensitization.13, 68 In addition to these findings, there is now experimental evidence that diesel particles, and perhaps other pollutants as well, act as adjuvants to enhance production of Th-2\u2013like cytokines and IgE production in cell culture and in the human in vivo.13, 68 Contrary to these findings, however, is a large study conducted in Germany shortly after reunification.97 German schoolchildren who presumably have a very similar genetic background but live in two different environments were evaluated for allergic sensitization and respiratory diseases. One group of children resided in Munich in the former West Germany, whereas the other group was from Halle, a city in the former East Germany with high levels of air pollution because of the burning of high-sulfur in home furnaces to provide heat. Although the total incidence of respiratory disease was greatest in the group from Halle, asthma and skin test positivity were nearly three times higher in the Munich schoolchildren. This study, like others, indicates that there are factors associated with the Western lifestyle that increase the risk for developing asthma and allergy. Furthermore, pollution did not seem to be associated with greater asthma or allergy. Clearly, air pollution is a complex entity, and it seems likely that individual pollutants may have divergent effects on the risk for developing allergy. Additional information is needed to determine the effects of specific pollutants or combinations of pollutants on rates of allergen sensitization.",

Interestingly, in both murine3 and human38 in vitro experiments, it has been noted that the G protein elicits a predominant Th-2 response, whereas the F protein produces a predominant Th-1 response. In mice, to test the activities of T cells recognizing individual RSV proteins in vivo, virus-specific T-cell lines have been produced using recombinant vaccinia viruses that express either the G or F proteins. Following passive transfer of these cell lines to naive recipients and subsequent intranasal inoculation with RSV virus, mice receiving G-specific cells have more severe illnesses characterized by lung hemorrhage, pulmonary neutrophil recruitment, and intense pulmonary eosinophilia.2 These experiments are of interest based on the adverse clinical response noted in many infants who received a formalin-inactivated RSV vaccine and subsequently became infected with RSV.67\n",

Roman et al75 evaluated 15 hospitalized infants (1\u201315 months) with an acute lower respiratory tract infection caused by RSV. Compared with control infants, the infected children had a suppression of their IFN-\u03b3 production and, although IL-4 production was also decreased, the IL-4/IFN-\u03b3 ratio was significantly increased. Renzi et al73 prospectively followed 26 infants hospitalized with bronchiolitis by obtaining blood samples at the time of illness and 5 months later. Compared with age-matched control infants, infected patients had an increased percentage of CD4+, CD25+, and CD23+ lymphocytes at the 5-month follow-up. Plasma IL-4 levels, although initially not different from control patients, increased significantly in the infected children 5 months later. Blood lymphocytes, obtained during the time of bronchiolitis, produced less IFN-\u03b3 in response to IL-2 in children who went on to develop a pattern of recurrent wheezing. Finally, peripheral blood lymphocytes from infants who had persistent wheezing produced more IL-4 in response to Dermatophagoides farinae antigen. Unfortunately, the pattern of cytokine response these infants had prior to infection was not evaluated, again begging the question as to which of the observed results may be cause and which may be effect.",

Does cytokine dysregulation influence the immunologic response to RSV leading to more severe disease (i.e., bronchiolitis)? Does RSV infection promote the development of cytokine dysregulation, thereby increasing the risk of developing atopic disorders? Do imprinted patterns of cytokine secretion and RSV infections interact at a critical time point to establish a particular wheezing phenotype with future infections or exposures? Additional prospective studies are needed to determine whether childhood infections can cause lasting effects on the immune system to modulate the subsequent risk of allergy and asthma. Alternately, there may be immune factors, perhaps genetically determined, that regulate both the immune response to infections and the risk of developing allergies or asthma.",

For example, Koller et al44 obtained serum for ECP determinations on 33 infants with no previous history of allergic disease and found that median ECP levels were four times higher in those infants who went on to develop recurrent wheezing in the following year. Additional studies are needed to evaluate whether increased ECP is associated with persistent asthma and whether this will be useful as a screening tool.",

So far, however, the techniques required to measure these factors are confined to research laboratories, and large-scale epidemiologic studies will be required to elucidate the value of these tests in clinical practice.",

Changes in the prenatal diet do not affect the risk for allergy and are unnecessary. Sensible dietary modifications for babies include breast-feeding, delaying the introduction of solid foods until 6 months of age, and withholding highly allergenic foods such as cow's milk, egg, and peanut for 2 to 3 years. Several formulas in which the protein source has been hydrolyzed to reduce antigenicity are listed in Table 1\n. These formulas may be used in a preventive fashion if the mother decides not to breast-feed109 or as alternatives to cow's milk or soy-based formulas after cessation of breast-feeding. Changing from breastmilk to a hypoallergenic formula seems to have little additional value, however, for infants who are breast-fed for longer than 6 months.65 Hypoallergenic formulas have the disadvantages of being more costly than standard infant formulas and have a strong taste that some infants find unpalatable, especially if the infant was initially fed breastmilk. In infants older than 6 months of age, alternatives to hypoallergenic formulas include vitamin D and calcium-fortified rice milk or orange juice, and these beverages are available in many health food stores and supermarkets.",

            "text": "Finally, reducing the exposure to environmental allergens can reduce symptoms in patients who already have respiratory allergies, and although the data are as yet incomplete, there are early indications that they could prevent or delay the onset of respiratory allergy or asthma. For example, Hide et al have conducted a study in which 120 infants were prospectively enrolled to determine the effects of combined dietary and environmental interventions on the development of atopic disorders.30, 31 In the active group, infants and lactating mothers were prescribed hypoallergenic diets, and house dust mite protein levels were controlled with acaricides and mattress covers. In addition to having significantly less atopic dermatitis at 1, 2, and 4 years of age, the prophylactic group had less asthma at 1 year of age and fewer children with positive skin tests at age 4 years. These results need to be independently confirmed but suggest that limiting exposure to inhalant and dietary allergens may have additive effects in the prevention of childhood allergies. Sensible guidelines for limiting exposure to indoor respiratory allergens (that were designed for patients with existing asthma) have been proposed by the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute62 and can be considered for preventive therapy. These guidelines follow:\n\u2022Animal danders: Do not allow furred pets in the home.\u2022House dust mite\nEssential: Encase mattresses and pillows in allergen-impermeable covers and wash sheets and blankets in hot (\u2265130\u00b0C) water every 7\u201314 days.Desirable: Reduce indoor humidity <50%, remove carpets from the bedroom and from concrete floors, and avoid sitting on upholstered furniture.\n\u2022Cockroaches: Use poison bait or traps to control; do not leave food or garbage exposed.\u2022Indoor mold: Fix all leaks and eliminate water sources associated with mold growth; clean moldy surfaces. Consider reducing indoor humidity to <50%.\n",
