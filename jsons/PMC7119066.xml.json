Because buds may be found in the distal bronchioles (so-called \u201cproliferative bronchiolitis\u201d), COP also has been termed \u201cidiopathic bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia.\u201d Because of some ambiguity with the other types of bronchiolitis (as constrictive bronchiolitis usually associated with airflow obstruction) and because organizing pneumonia is the characteristic and predominant pathologic pattern, with bronchiolitis only an accessory finding, the current internationally recognized terminology is COP [1].",

The process is patchy, and usually the lesions are all the same age. In some cases, however, the different stages of organization (from fibrinoid inflammatory cell clusters to mature fibrotic buds) may be found on the same biopsy specimen. The lesions are centered on the small airways and distal to them. A mild cellular inflammatory infiltration of the interstitium is present. Type II cell metaplasia may be associated. Foamy macrophages are commonly present in the airspaces [2].",

The negative findings for the diagnosis of organizing pneumonia pattern include the lack of prominent cellular and significant interstitial fibrosis, the lack of fibroblastic foci, the absence of granulomas, the lack of hyaline membranes and vasculitis, and little or no eosinophilia [3]. Other disorders in which organizing pneumonia may be present (and even represent the major histologic finding) also must be excluded (eg, the bronchiolitis obliterans\u2013organizing pneumonia variant of Wegener's granulomatosis) [4].",

(It is worthwhile to remember that it was initially described at the beginning of the twentieth century in nonresolving pneumococcal pneumonia.) Drugs are other established causes of organizing pneumonia (Box 2\n). The syndrome of organizing pneumonia \u201cprimed\u201d by radiation therapy for breast cancer closely resembles COP [25], [26], [27]. It differs from radiation pneumonitis by the involvement of nonirradiated parts of the lungs, the possible migration of opacities, and the lack of chronic sequelae. The syndrome develops within weeks or months after radiation therapy. As in COP, corticosteroids are efficient, but relapses may occur after reducing or stopping treatment. Radiation therapy to the breast induces bilateral lymphocytic alveolitis [28], but only a few patients develop organizing pneumonia, which suggests that a second hit or an individual genetic or acquired susceptibility is necessary for organizing pneumonia to occur.Box 1Infectious causes of organizing pneumoniaBacteria\n\nChlamydia pneumoniae\n\nCoxiella burnetii\n\nLegionella pneumophila\n\nMycoplasma pneumoniae\n\nNocardia asteroides\n\nPseudomonas aeruginosa\n\nSerratia marcescens\n\nStaphylococcus aureus\nStreptococcus group B (newborn treated by extracorporeal oxygenation)\nStreptococcus pneumoniae\n\nViruses\nHerpesvirusHIVInfluenza virusParainfluenza virusCytomegalovirusHuman herpesvirus-7 (after lung transplantation)\nParasites\n\nPlasmodium vivax\n\nFungi\n\nCryptococcus neoformans\n\nPenicillium janthinellum\n\nPneumocystis carinii (after highly active antiretroviral therapy in patients with AIDS)\n\nData from Cordier JF.

One or more relapses (mean 2.4 \u00b1 2.2) occurred in 58% of patients (one in 31% and two or more in 27%, with 19% having multiple [\u22653] relapses).

These results suggest that relapse on more than 20 mg of prednisone per day is rare and should lead to a reconsideration of the diagnosis of COP (especially if not histologically established).

Our current policy of treatment aims at obtaining a well-equilibrated balance between efficient treatment and adverse effects of corticosteroids by using low doses and relatively short treatment duration.

The CT findings of organizing pneumonia are similar to those of severe acute respiratory syndrome, which correspond to diffuse alveolar damage [111].
