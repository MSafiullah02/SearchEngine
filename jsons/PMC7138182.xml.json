Smaller proteins bearing SPs and larger proteins with poorly functional SPs can be pulled through the channel by a chaperone in the ER lumen, such as BiP, a heat shock 70 (Hsp70) family protein.7, 9 For most type I transmembrane proteins, such as the HIV entry receptor, cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4), the SP is the first 15\u201340 amino acids at the N-terminus of the nascent chain of the preprotein. About 5\u201310% of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are the targets of about 30% of drugs on the market,1 have N-terminal signal peptides.19 For the remainder, the first transmembrane domain serves as the signal sequence for targeting to the translocon.",

The model shown in Fig. 1\nis based on previously reported models,7, 8, 20, 21 on cryo-EM structures of ribosome-nascent chain complexes (RNCs),22, 23, 24 and on studies described below. The structure of the translocon is universally conserved,23 but SPs have a wide variety of primary structures that are specific for every protein and are different for the same protein in different species. All SPs have a central, hydrophobic domain consisting of at least six non-hydrophilic amino acid residues forming about two \u03b1-helical turns (labeled H in Fig. 1), a cationic N-terminal domain (labeled N in Fig. 1), and a C-terminal segment between the H region and the cleavage site on the N-terminus of the mature protein (labeled C in Fig. 1). In eukaryotes, the main component of the heterotrimeric translocon termed Sec61\u03b1 consists of ten transmembrane \u03b1-helices and adopts the shape of an hourglass in its resting state.23 Leakage of calcium and other constituents of the lumen are prevented by residues that form a central \u201cpore ring\u201d and by a short, terminal \u03b1-helix that serves as a plug. Protein translation begins in the cytosol. The emerging SP and ribosome are bound by the signal recognition particle (SRP), which temporarily arrests or slows translation.24 The SRP then binds to the SRP receptor (SR) on the ER membrane, and the ribosome with the nascent protein chain (RNC) is transferred to the translocon, converting it to a \u201cprimed\u201d state. A key feature of the translocon is its \u201clateral gate,\u201d which is partially opened by RNC binding, exposing a hydrophobic pocket (Fig. 1, step 1).",

Studies suggest that the SP of CD4, and the transmembrane signal sequences of some Type II signal anchor proteins, initially bind to the translocon head-first, with their N termini facing the ER lumen. As translation pushes the nascent chain deeper into the translocon, the SP apparently does a flip-turn and reorients with its N terminus facing the cytosol (Fig. 1, step 3). The SP apparently moves fully into the lateral gate, making room for the elongating chain to pass through the channel into the ER lumen. The SP is cleaved by a signal peptidase (SPase)28 at the luminal surface of the ER membrane and chain elongation continues. For a Type I transmembrane protein such as CD4, when a hydrophobic transmembrane segment is produced, it binds to the lateral gate and passes into the ER membrane (Fig. 1, step 6). Finally, the protein is released when the mRNA stop codon is reached and the ribosome dissociates from the ER (Fig. 1, step 7).",

Certain specific structural factors are known to facilitate translocation, including basic residues in the N region of the SP and hydrophobic residues, especially leucine, in the H domain. The positive charge of the N domain facilitates the cytosolic orientation shown for steps 3 and 4 in Fig. 1, and hydrophobicity of the H domain favors insertion of this \u03b1-helix into the lateral gate (gating), apparently making room for passage of the downstream residues through the channel. The human prion preprotein, which has a SP with minimal positive charge in the N region and with a weakly hydrophobic H region, undergoes BiP-assisted co-translational translocation.21, 31, 33, 34 The N-to-cytosol orientation of the prion protein is apparently further destabilized by four positively charged residues at the N terminus of its mature domain.33 Chaperone assistance is apparently required for translocation of proteins that cannot effectively be pushed through the translocon by the force of translational elongation, either because they enter the channel post-translationally or because they cannot easily achieve the required N-to-cytosol orientation. BiP is an ATPase, and its role facilitating translocation of a subset of proteins makes it a potential drug target.",

            "text": "It is interesting that the SPs of many proteins have H regions containing some polar, uncharged amino acid residues, such as asparagine, glutamine, serine, threonine, tyrosine, and tryptophan. Some even contain a charged residue, such as aspartate, glutamate, lysine , or arginine, and many contain cysteine, which can potentially form covalent bonds. Are these the results of neutral mutations? The relatively slow rates of evolution of SPs and their variability in efficiency suggest not.21 Why aren\u2019t all SP H domains composed solely of hydrophobic residues, such as leucine, isoleucine, valine and phenylalanine? It was proposed that the structures of SPs are evolutionarily matched with those of the mature domains to facilitate efficient translocation,43 but it has also been recognized that maximum translocation efficiency is not always optimal. SPs can be used by cells to control the efficiency of protein compartmentalization30 and to attenuate protein translocation in response to ER stress,34 so the translocation step can serve as a checkpoint for protein regulation.21 Nonoptimal H-residues may have been selected to reduce the efficiency of expression of some proteins. An interesting case is the lutenizing hormone receptor (LHR). A common human mutation (insLQ-LHR) introduces two additional amino acids into the H region of the LHR preprotein, which increases the efficiency of translocation and LHR expression. In women, this mutation is statistically correlated with shortening of disease-free breast cancer survival rates.44 Polar residues in H regions may have a beneficial effect of regulating expression of many proteins and can potentially serve as handles for SP-targeting drugs.",

A pharmacokinetic evaluation of mycolactone as a subcutaneous analgesic was recently reported.55 The authors found that in mice the analgesic effects of mycolactone were dependent on type-2 angiotensin II receptors (AT2R) and not related to its previously reported suppression of inflammation. This observation is consistent with the expectation that mycolactone inhibits translocation of the angiotensin precursor protein, angiotensinogen, which is expressed with a 33-residue SP on the N-terminus of its preprotein. Hence, the angiotensinogen SP could become a target for developing selective analgesic drugs, as well as anti-hypertensive agents. The cytotoxic effects of substrate-nonselective translocation inhibitors also suggest the translocon as a target for anticancer drugs. Interestingly, there are translocon mutations (channelopathies) that impair protein translocation and many are associated with certain diseases, such as diabetes.17 It is conceivable that small molecules acting as translocation facilitators could be used for treatment of such diseases.",

Photoaffinity labeling and resistance mutation studies have shown that these cycloheptadepsipeptides primarily bind to the Sec61\u03b1 subunit of the translocon,56, 60, 61 but they more potently inhibit translocation of certain preproteins in a SP-selective manner. Two proteins targeted by these cyclodepsipeptides are the vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM1) and the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Mutagenesis studies of the SPs and N-terminal mature domains of these proteins have been performed, showing the importance of specific amino acids in the H and C domains.57, 58 A cyclodecadepsipeptide named decatransin has also been reported to inhibit protein co-translational translocation with a similar selectivity profile and resistance mutations occur in similar locations of Sec61\u03b162 It is also of interest that the cyclodecadepsipeptide ionophore antibiotic valinomycin has been reported to inhibit translocation of hamster but not human prion protein.31 Valinomycin is known to be a down-regulator of BiP, which assists translocation of the prion preprotein, so it has been suggested that the hamster prion nascent chain might require more assistance from BiP than the human variant.46 On the other hand, valinomycin and decatransin are of similar size and hydrophobicity, suggesting that they may bind to the translocon in a similar manner, leaving the reason for substrate selectivity unclear.47\n",

Their hydrophobic structures suggest that they may compete with the H domain of the nascent chain SP for binding to the lateral gate, and a rough correlation between sensitivity to their inhibitory effects and SP hydrophobicity has been observed.57, 58 A mechanistic model has been reported in which cotransin binding allosterically prevents lateral gating of the SP or transmembrane domain, but \u201cTMDs with increased hydrophobicity and helical propensity can override the cotransin-imposed block.\u201d61 On the other hand, an H-region conformational consensus motif for sensitivity of signal sequences to cotransin has been identified.63 It was reported that specific combinations of certain amino acids were important, rather than length or hydrophobicity of the signal sequence. The nonselective translocation inhibitor apratoxin A is a macrocyclic tetrapeptide that also acts as a gating inhibitor. Resistance mutations occur in a similar area of Sec61\u03b1 as for cotransin and decatransin, so it has been proposed that all of these compounds bind and act in a similar, but not identical, manner.48\n",

CADA compounds are radically different from conventional anti-HIV agents that have viral targets and are highly susceptible to onset of resistance by mutation and selection mechanisms. CADA compounds target cellular machinery for expression of CD4, an essential receptor for HIV entry. Hence, it is quite difficult to generate a CADA-resistant virus in vitro; the resulting strain has relatively poor infectivity and is susceptible to neutralizing antibodies.64 CADA has low cytotoxicity and has been shown to selectively down-modulate CD4, without affecting expression of 15 other surface proteins examined on T-cells.72 Available evidence indicates that CADA acts as a co-translational translocation inhibitor through direct interaction with the human CD4 SP (vide infra).",

The \u201cabsolute IC50\u201d is the concentration at which protein is decreased by 50%. The values for sortilin and CD4 are ~10 \u03bcM and 0.35 \u03bcM, respectively. Absolute IC50 values are of clinical relevance, but the inflection points give \u201crelative IC50s,\u201d which are of importance to the mechanism of action. When calculated as the concentration giving 50% of the maximum effect observed for each drug, the resulting relative IC50 values are 0.38 and 0.21 \u03bcM for sortilin and CD4, respectively. Under ideal conditions, the relative IC50 value is equal to the dissociation constant of a drug-target complex. Hence, CADA appears to bind almost as strongly to the sortilin SP as to the CD4 SP, yet the maximum down-modulation for sortilin is only ~ 50%, while CD4 is decreased by ~90%.",

CADA has no effect on production of CD4 mRNA or on targeting of the RNC to the ER membrane.27 In the absence of ER microsomes, CADA has no effect on CD4 synthesis in vitro. In the presence of ER microsomes, CADA prevents translocation of CD4 across the ER membrane. With RNCs bearing N-terminal glycosylation tags, CADA has been shown to inhibit inversion of the SP, blocking translocation of CD4, leading to its diversion to the cytosol (Fig. 4, step 4), where it is degraded by proteolysis.27 It is not currently known whether CADA-displaced proteins are degraded by the ubiquiting proteasome system. According to surface plasmon resonance (SPR) studies, CADA directly binds the 25-residue SP of human (and probably, more generally, primate) CD4, but not mouse CD4, which has less homology with the human CD4 SP.27 We postulate that CADA binds the CD4 SP in a folded conformation, stabilizing an otherwise transitory state in the inversion process, as shown in Fig. 4. CADA is more specific than other selective co-translational translocation inhibitors and it has been proven to primarily target the SP.",

The para-nitro analog has very low potency, but moving nitro to the meta, then ortho position restores potency. These effects cannot be understood considering electron density alone (red, electron rich; blue, electron poor, Fig. 5). We calculated dipole moments of N,N-dimethylarenesulfonamides modeling each side arm and found a linear correlation between the pIC50 values for CD4 downmodulation and the component of the dipole moment in the plane of the benzene ring of the model compound (Fig. 5 inset).69 The IC50 value is related to the dissociation constant of a drug-target complex, so this result indicates that interaction of the side arm dipole with the SP is a major determinant of binding energy.",

The Gln-15 mutation had the largest effect and made CADA potency immeasurable for both the FL and YFP constructs. Because of the correlation between side arm dipole moment with potency described above, we propose that CADA compounds recognize Gln-15 through a dipole\u2013dipole interaction. Replacing Arg-8 with alanine had the second largest effect of reducing CADA potency, which can be attributed to either a secondary interaction with CADA or an effect of decreasing positive charge near the N region of the SP. Pro-20 was also replaced with alanine, resulting in greatly decreased sensitivity to CADA, especially in the YFP construct. Converting it to glycine fully restored CADA sensitivity, which is consistent with this residue forming a hairpin turn in our model and with both proline and glycine being known helix terminators. Exchanging Ala-17 with a valine residue resulted in decreased sensitivity to CADA, which can be attributed to increased hydrophobicity. A general trend observed is that lowering hydrophobicity in the H region increased sensitivity to CADA. Finally, replacing Lys-26 and Lys-27 with alanine also significantly decreased CADA potency, which can be attributed to decreased positive charge at the N terminus of the mature domain.",

First, both have a polar glutamine residue in the H region, which is consistent with our hypothesis that Q15 is important for binding by a dipole\u2013dipole interaction between CADA and the CD4 SP. As noted above, the relative IC50 values suggest that CADA binds CD4 and sortilin with similar affinities. Also, the SPs of both CD4 and sortilin have H domains terminated by proline, actually two prolines in the case of sortilin. A turn at the end of the H-region \u03b1-helix may be important for stabilizing a folded structure of the drug-target complex that keeps the cleavage site away from the SPase active site on the luminal side of the ER membrane. A key difference between the SPs is that the N domain of sortilin is about twice as long as that of CD4. This may explain the lower efficacy for translocation inhibition by CADA for sortilin because its cleavage site may be statistically positioned much closer to the SPase active site. The emergent speculations so far are that for an SP to be druggable it must have: 1. One or more polar or otherwise recognizable amino acid in the H domain, which has the highest degree of secondary structure in the nascent chain; and 2. one or more proline or glycine residues terminating the H region. Polar groups in the H region may reside in the hydrophobic environment of the lateral gate, enhancing the binding energy of polar interactions, including dipole\u2013dipole interactions, hydrogen bonds, and salt bridges.",

The SPs of proteins are unique and many contain residues in their H regions that might be targeted by ionic, hydrogen bonding, dipolar, or covalent interactions, which are already familiar to medicinal chemists.

Some studies found that tianeptine is a \u03bc-opioid receptor agonist,94, 95 but others showed recently that it inhibits neuronal inflammation by suppressing toll-like receptor TLR4-related pathways.96, 97 It is a nonplanar sulfonamide with aromatic benzene rings that could bind an SP H-region \u03b1-helix with van der Waals interactions, as we propose for CADA compounds. Tianeptine might down-modulate receptors or cytokines on TLR4 inflammation pathways by inhibiting their co-translational translocation across the ER membrane. In the search to develop new SP-binding drugs, we suggest focusing on proteins with recognized therapeutic potential that have SPs containing potentially recognizable residues in their H domains, including asparagine, aspartate, cysteine, glutamate, glutamine, histidine, lysine, methionine, serine, threonine, tryptophan, and tyrosine.",
