Over the past decade, extensive research has identified key components of SGs, their molecular interactions, and impact on stress-induced reprogramming of protein expression and cell survival. However, studies defining the signaling pathways that modulate SG assembly have only been launched recently. These studies reveal that posttranslational modifications of selected SG proteins play important roles in the regulation of SG assembly and function. Here we provide an overview of the signaling pathways and posttranslational protein modifications that regulate the assembly and function of SGs. \uf8e9",

            "text": "E ukaryotic cells respond to environmental stress by reprogramming protein translation. 1 The translation of mRNAs encoding 'housekeeping' proteins is turned off, allowing cells to conserve energy for the repair of stress-induced molecular damage. At the same time, translation of mRNAs encoding proteins that re-fold denatured proteins or repair oxidative damage is turned on, allowing cells to survive under adverse conditions. The mRNAs that are translationally repressed during stress accumulate at discrete cytoplasmic foci known as stress granules (SGs). 2 The core components of SGs are translationally stalled non-canonical 48S pre-initiation complexes, but many other proteins are also concentrated at these foci. 2 Processing bodies (PBs) are a related class of RNA granules at which untranslated mRNA accumulates while awaiting degradation. [3] [4] [5] The core components of PBs are mRNA decay factors including deadenylases, decapping enzymes, and a 5 \u21923 exonuclease. Unlike SGs, PBs are found in the cytoplasm * Correspondence to: panderson@rics.bwh.harvard.edu 1 of unstressed cells. Like SGs, the number of PBs increases when cells are exposed to adverse conditions. The messenger ribonucleoproteins (mRNPs) within SGs and PBs are in a dynamic equilibrium with polysomes. 6, 7 Consequently, the assembly of SGs and PBs is inhibited by drugs that freeze mRNAs within polysomes (e.g., emetine, cycloheximide). These observations led us to propose that SGs function as effectors of molecular triage whereby the composition of the mRNP determines whether individual transcripts are degraded, stored, or reinitiated. 8 As recent reviews have described the dynamic properties of SGs and their components that are crucial for SG assembly, 2,9,10 these topics will not be discussed here. In this review, we focus on the signaling pathways that produce posttranslational modifications that promote the assembly of SGs.",

Data from immunofluorescence microscopy suggest that stalled 48S pre-initiation complexes aggregate into visible foci through the coordinate actions of multiple RNA-binding proteins that contain self-aggregation domains. One well-characterized example of a selfaggregation domain is the prion-related glutaminerich domain in TIA-1/TIAR, members of the RNArecognition motif (RRM) family of RNA-binding proteins. 11, 19, 20 Additional SG-associated proteins possessing aggregation domains include G3BP, fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), and TTP. 2 Phosphorylation of SG components also plays an important role in the life cycle of several different viruses. In cells infected with either semliki forest virus 21 or herpes simplex virus type 1, 22 activation of PKR results in the transient assembly of SGs that may contribute to the shut down of host protein synthesis. In contrast, during rotavirus infection, eIF2\u03b1 is phosphorylated but SGs are not assembled. 23 Relocalization of PABP to the nucleus has been proposed to contribute to the inhibition of SG assembly. It is possible that this virus facilitates the expression of its mRNAs by preventing the formation of SGs in the host cell. These studies suggest that manipulation of SG assembly may provide targets for the development of new anti-viral therapies.",

RACK1 is a scaffold protein that is required for the activation of the MAP kinase cascade that culminates in the activation of p38 and JNK, potent effectors of stress-induced apoptosis. In stressed cells, sequestration of RACK1 at SGs prevents stressinduced apoptosis, allowing SGs to actively promote the survival of cells exposed to adverse conditions. 32 Similarly, the recruitment of the RSK2 kinase to SGs and to the nucleus requires its binding to TIA-1, which affects both its ability to induce cyclin D1 and promote survival of cells exposed to oxidative stress. 33 It is possible that these kinases modulate SG assembly independent of their kinase activity. This could involve heterotypic interactions with specific SG components or disruption of interactions between SG components.",

[53] [54] [55] [56] Mass-spectrometric analysis revealed that GST-eIF5A fusion protein can be co-purified with the translation elongation factor 2 (eEF2) in yeast, suggesting that eIF5A associates with translationally elongating ribosomes. 54 Genetic evidence also showed that an eIF5A mutant tif51A-3 interacts with the translation elongation mutant eft2 H699K (eEF2). Moreover, polysome profiling analysis with temperature-sensitive eIF5A mutants showed an increase in polysome peaks compared to isogenic wild-type controls that is also observed in the eft2 H699K mutant. 55 The retention of polysomes under cyclohexamide (CHX)-free conditions was also observed in the yeast tif51a-td, a temperature-sensitive eIF5A degron mutant cultured at the restrictive temperature. Most importantly, eIF5A but not a nonhypusinatable mutant [eIF5A(K51R)] can stimulate translation elongation and termination in an in vitro system. 56 Our RNAi screen revealed that ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), an enzyme required for the synthesis of polyamines, is essential for arsenite-induced assembly of SGs. 53 Moreover, siRNA-mediated depletion of eIF5A, a downstream target of the polyamine pathway, dramatically reduces SG formation in cells exposed to oxidative stress. This is further supported by the finding that knockdown (using siRNAs) or inhibition (using GC7) of DHS, an enzyme that covalently joins spermidine to eIF5A, 57 inhibits SG assembly. We concluded that hypusination of eIF5A via polyamine synthesis pathway is crucial for SG formation. 53 Because stalled translation elongation induced by cycloheximide or emetine inhibits SG assembly, eIF5A may be required to maintain translation elongation in stressed cells. Several lines of evidence support this hypothesis. First, temperature-sensitive eIF5A mutants are hypersensitive to the peptidyltransferase inhibitors sparsomycin and anisomycin. 54 Second, translation elongation factor 2 (eEF2) and 80S ribosomal subunits co-purify with eIF5A. 54 Third, ribosomal transit time is abnormal upon eIF5A inactivation and this phenomenon mimics effects of the eEF2 inhibitor sordarin. 55, 56 Finally, we have found that eIF5A knockdown delays ribosome runoff in U2OS cells subjected to arsenite-induced oxidative stress. 53 Similar results were observed following ODC1 knockdown which significantly impairs eIF5A hypusination. 53 Thus, hypusinated eIF5A may play an important role in promoting translation elongation in stressed compared to unstressed cells. Depletion of eEF2 also has a strong inhibitory effect on SG formation 34 ( Figure 2 ). As eEF2 is phosphorylated in response to stress, this modification may modulate interactions with eIF5A.",

Thus, methylation of FMRP appears to be required for both recruitment to SGs and optimal SG assembly.",

In contrast to FMRP, methylation of RGG promotes the relocalization of CIRP from the nucleus to the cytoplasm of stressed cells.

SGs help to silence the expression of housekeeping genes and promote the expression of molecular chaperones that repair stress-induced damage. 74 At the same time, sequestration of selected proteins within SGs (e.g., RACK1, RSK2) may determine whether stressed cells live and repair stress-induced damage, or die by apoptosis. In this sense, SGs may play a key role in modulating life or death decisions in cells exposed to adverse conditions. The finding that SG assembly and disassembly are regulated by myriad posttranslational modifications of SG components indicates that this process is subject to complex regulation. It is likely that the identification of new types of modifications, additional modified target proteins, and upstream signaling pathways will be essential to fully understand the functions of SGs. Drugs that target these signaling cascades may prove useful in the treatment of infectious diseases and cancer. ",
