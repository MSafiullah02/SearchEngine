The guideline is based on evidence as well as on expert opinion and is for use by both adult physicians and paediatricians practicing in allergy. The recommendations are evidence graded. During the development of these guidelines, all BSACI members were included in the consultation process using a web-based system. Their comments and suggestions were carefully considered by the SOCC. Where evidence was lacking, consensus was reached by the experts on the committee. Included in this guideline are clinical classification of rhinitis, aetiology, diagnosis, investigations and management including subcutaneous and sublingual immunotherapy. There are also special sections for children, co-morbid associations and pregnancy. Finally, we have made recommendations for potential areas of future research.",

The nose is the gateway to the respiratory tract and rhinitis is associated with symptoms arising from the sinuses [5] , middle ear [6] , the nasopharynx and lower airways [7] . Occupational rhinitis often precedes the development of occupational asthma. Both allergic rhinitis (AR) and non-AR are risk factors for the development of asthma [7] . Rhinosinusitis can also be the presenting complaint of potentially severe systemic disorders such as Wegener's granulomatosis, sarcoidosis and Churg-Strauss syndrome [8] . Therefore, all patients presenting with nasal symptoms require appropriate treatment based on an accurate diagnosis. Separate British Society for Allergy and Clinical Immunology (BSACI) guidelines on rhinosinusitis and nasal polyposis will also be published.",

Recent reviews include the 'ARIA Update' [138] and 'Standards for Practical Immunotherapy' (European guideline) [139] . Whereas non-sedating anti-histamines and topical nasal corticosteroids remain first-line treatments for AR, immunotherapy is recommended in those subjects with IgE-mediated disease in whom allergen avoidance is either undesirable or not feasible and who fail to respond to optimal treatment [18] . The benefit to risk ratio should be considered in every case. The quality of allergen vaccines is important and only standardized extracts should be used.

A recent Cochrane meta-analysis [147] concluded that 'SLIT is a safe treatment which significantly reduces symptoms and medication requirements in AR. The size of the benefit compared with that of other available therapies, particularly injection immunotherapy, is not clear, having been assessed directly in very few studies. Further research is required concentrating on optimizing allergen dosage and patient selection'. Recent studies performed in large samples of patients have shown a clear dose effect of tablet-based SLIT in patients with grass pollen-induced rhinoconjunctivitis [148] [149] [150] . In one study in which subcutaneous and SLIT for seasonal rhinitis were compared, both were effective compared with placebo, although the study was underpowered to detect differences between treatments [151] . A further recent trial of grass allergen tablets for sublingual use demonstrated a 30-40% improvement in symptom and medication scores and an approximate 50% increase in the responder rate, compared with placebo [152] . A further follow-up for 5 years is planned in order to assess possible long-term benefits of SLIT as has already been confirmed for the subcutaneous route.",

A number of allergens affect both the nose and the lungs [163] and allergy to HDM or cat dander is a risk factor for both asthma and rhinitis [170, 171] . Many patients with AR have increased non-specific bronchial reactivity [172, 173] during seasonal [174] and perennial [175] allergen exposure. Asthma [169] and bronchial hyperresponsiveness are more common and severe in perennial compared with seasonal rhinitis [175, 176] . Patients with SAR develop seasonal increases in nonspecific bronchial responsiveness (BR) but not necessarily asthma symptoms, and these patients often have normal BR during the winter months [177] . BR is also increased in viral rhinitis [178, 179] and following nasal allergen challenge [180, 181] . These observations suggest that bronchial inflammation is associated with nasal inflammation, and is supported by the fact that bronchial hyperreactivity is reversed by intranasal treatment with sodium cromoglycate [182] and corticosteroids [38, 183] . Nasal allergen challenge results in eosinophil ingress not only to the nose but also to the bronchi, and vice versa [184] . Segmental bronchoprovocation with allergen in AR patients leads to significant changes in mast cell and basophil numbers in both the nasal and bronchial mucosa [185] . A systemic link has been postulated with inhaled allergen, causing a release of immature eosinophils from the bone marrow into the circulation, from where they migrate to the whole respiratory tract, not just to the site of allergen contact [186] .",

These chemicals give rise to the typical immediate symptoms experienced by the patient. In many patients, there is also a late-phase reaction in which T helper type 2 cytokines induce an eosinophilic inflammatory infiltrate, similar to that seen in asthma.
