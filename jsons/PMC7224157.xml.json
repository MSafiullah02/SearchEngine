            "text": "An attractive alternative for mAbs is single-domain antibodies from camelid immunoglobulins, termed VHH, or nanobodies that are the smallest naturally occurring antigen-binding protein domains with a molecular weight of 12\u201315 kilodaltons (kDa) (Muyldermans, 2013). Their small size provides several advantages over conventional mAbs (150 kDa), including larger number of accessible epitopes, relatively low production costs, and ease of rapid production at kilogram scale in prokaryotic expression systems (Wu et al., 2017). More importantly, nanobodies can be administered by inhaled delivery because of their small size and favorable biophysical characteristics, making them particularly suitable for the treatment of respiratory diseases (Van Heeke et al., 2017). For instance, ALX-0171, an inhaled anti-respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) nanobody developed by Ablynx, was found to have robust antiviral effects and reduce signs and symptoms of RSV infection in animal models. Moreover, it was well tolerated at all doses when administered by inhalation in clinical trials (Larios Mora et al., 2018). These findings confirmed the feasibility of administering nanobodies via inhalation. However, the camelid origin of nanobodies limits their application as therapeutics in humans. To reduce the risk of immunogenicity, strategies for humanization of camelid nanobodies have become available in recent years but suffered from time- and labor-intensive processes (Vincke et al., 2009). Humanized nanobodies also retain a small number of camelid residues, especially several specific \u201challmark\u201d residues (F37, E44, R45, and G47) within framework region 2 (FR2), in order to maintain solubility and antigen-binding affinity of parental antibodies (Muyldermans, 2013, Wu et al., 2017).",

As a result, 17 human germline IGHV alleles, along with a camelid nanobody (VHH#3) as control (Beirnaert et al., 2017), were cloned, expressed in Escherichia coli, and characterized for their biophysical properties (Figure 1B). Eight out of 17 alleles could be highly expressed with yields of over 10 mg/L bacterial culture, and 10 out of 17 possessed protein-A-binding capabilities. Notably, germline 3-66\u221701 exhibited the most advantageous properties, including midpoint transition temperature (T\nm) comparable to that of camelid nanobody and the highest aggregation temperature (T\nagg) among all tested antibodies.

To this end, the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 was first used as the target antigen during bio-panning. Significant enrichment was achieved after two rounds of panning, and a panel of 18 unique single-domain antibodies were selected for further studies (Figure 2\nA). They bound potently and specifically to the SARS-CoV-2 RBD and could be divided into three competition groups (A, B, or C) by competition binding assays (Figures 2A and 2B). Most of the antibodies belonged to competition group A represented by n3021, which was also the most enriched clone with subnanomolar affinity (0.6 nM) to RBD (Figure 2C; Table S2). The group A antibodies showed moderate competition with ACE2 for the binding to RBD (Figures 2A and S2) and had no binding to a RBD variant (T500A/N501A/G502A) with mutation of ACE2-binding residues (Figure S3), indicating that their epitope overlaps with ACE2-binding motifs of RBD. To our surprise, none of these antibodies showed efficient neutralization at 50 \u03bcg/mL in a well-established SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus infection assay (data not shown) (Xia et al., 2020a, Xia et al., 2020b). These results suggest that some non-neutralizing epitopes are relatively immunogenic in the isolated SARS-CoV-2 RBD, in contrast to that of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, in which the neutralizing subregion was found to be highly immunogenic (Berry et al., 2010).",

The critical residues (D428, F429, E516) for the binding of group D antibody n3130 were located within the epitope of CR3022 as indicated by alanine scanning mutagenesis of SARS-CoV-2 RBD (Figure S3). Recent studies indicated that CR3022 recognizes a cryptic epitope that is only accessible when S protein is in \u201copen\u201d conformations (Yuan et al., 2020). This epitope could be less accessible in SARS-CoV-2 than in SARS-CoV, explaining why CR3022 was capable of neutralizing SARS-CoV but not SARS-CoV-2 (Wrapp et al., 2020, Yuan et al., 2020). As shown in the recent research (Yuan et al., 2020) and our modeling results (Figure 3F), the binding of CR3022 to homotrimeric SARS-CoV-2 spike is sterically hindered even when the RBD protomers adopt a double \u201cup\u201d conformation. In contrast, despite binding to the same cryptic epitope, the small-size single-domain antibody is very well tolerated in the lateral space between two adjacent RBD protomers.",

            "text": "It is very intriguing that the panning with SARS-CoV-2 S1 or RBD protein as antigen resulted in a substantially different spectra of antibodies. The antibodies identified from S1 panning were very diverse, covering four distinct epitopes on SARS-CoV RBD (competition groups A, B, D, and E). In contrast, most of the antibodies from RBD panning belonged to competition group A represented by n3021, which was also the most dominant clone after two rounds of panning. Furthermore, group A antibodies showed moderate competition with ACE2 for RBD binding but proved to be ineffective viral neutralizers. This phenomenon is quite different from that of SARS-CoV, in which the dominance of an antigenic loop within RBD made it relatively easy to isolate potent SARS-CoV neutralizing antibodies independent of repertoire, species, quaternary structure, and the technology used to derive the antibodies (Berry et al., 2010). Similarly, we previously used MERS-CoV S1 or RBD to isolate antibodies from a naive antibody library, and panning that used either of the two antigens led to dominant enrichment of antibodies that precisely targeted 90% of the receptor binding site within RBD and neutralized the virus potently (Ying et al., 2015b). It was proposed that viruses like SARS-CoV have not yet evolved such that their membrane glycoproteins could avoid direct immune recognition of a single site critical to virus pathogenesis (Berry et al., 2010). It should be pointed out that the difference in the immunogenicity of RBD was observed solely based on in vitro experiments and might not correlate with humoral immune responses in vivo. In this regard, it is imperative to investigate the immunogenic characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 RBD with special attention to potentially antigenic and non-neutralizing epitopes.",

The mAb CR3022 also recognizes this epitope but cannot neutralize SARS-CoV-2, implying the advantage of small-size single-domain antibodies to target cryptic eptiopes. Such hidden trimeric interface epitope was also observed recently in the study of influenza antibodies by our group (Yu et al., 2017) and several other groups (Bajic et al., 2019, Bangaru et al., 2019, Watanabe et al., 2019).

            "text": "Fully human single-domain antibodies offer the potential for prevention and treatment of COVID-19. First, antibodies derived entirely from human sequences would be less immunogenic than camelid or humanized nanobodies, leading to improved safety and efficacy when used in humans. Indeed, despite humanization, caplacizumab, the first nanobody approved by FDA, still contains multiple camelid residues to maintain the antigen binding affinity (Ulrichts et al., 2011). Second, small size and favorable biophysical properties allow for large-scale production of single-domain antibodies within a few weeks in prokaryotic expression systems, thus enabling rapid implementation in an outbreak setting. Furthermore, single-domain antibodies could be delivered to the lung via inhalation, which could offer considerable advantages for treatment of COVID-19, including fast onset of action, low systemic exposure, and high concentration of therapeutics at the site of disease. Lastly, single-domain antibodies can be used alone or synergistically with other neutralizing antibodies. Their small size makes them ideal building blocks for generation of bispecific or multi-specific antibodies to prevent the appearance of viral escape mutants. They can also be easily engineered to further increase neutralization activity by increasing binding moieties. For instance, the trivalent nanobody ALX-0171 was found to have 6,000-fold increased neutralization potency against RSV-A and >10,000-fold against RSV-B compared to its monovalent format (Detalle et al., 2015).",

Next, biosensors were dipped into wells containing the second single-domain antibody with the same concentration at 15 \u03bcg/mL, or 17 \u03bcg/mL ACE2 (Novoprotein Scientific Inc., Shanghai), in the presence of the first competing single-domain antibody, and binding was measured after 300 s of association. For competition of single-domain antibodies with the antibody CR3022, 6 \u03bcg/mL of CR3022 in scFv format were incubated with sensors loaded with SARS-CoV-2 RBD for 300 s to reach binding saturation. Then, the sensors were immersed into wells containing the competition single-domain antibody at 15 \u03bcg/mL in the presence of the 6 \u03bcg/mL CR3022, and binding was measured for 300 s. The signal obtained for binding of the second antibody in the presence of the first antibody was expressed as a percentage of the uncompeted binding of the second antibody that was derived independently. The antibodies were defined as competing if the presence of first antibody reduced the signal of the second antibody to less than 30% of its maximal binding capacity, and non-competing when binding was greater than 70%. A level of 30%\u201369% was considered intermediate competition.",
