Sixty-two patients who experienced the onset of SARS symptoms during the period from 18 March 18 2003 through 30 March 2003 were recruited. All patients had pneumonia and positive SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) seroconversion. The mean age (\u00b1SD) was 37.07 \u00b1 12.96 years, the ratio of male subjects to female subjects was 0.82, and the intubation rate was 9.6%. In this cohort, 90.3% of patients received treatment with ribavirin and corticosteroids [1]. The median interval (\u00b1SD) between the onset of SARS symptoms and the first follow-up visit was 6.59 \u00b1 1.07 weeks.",

No patient reported sputum production. Patients described palpitation as a paroxysmal, fast heart beat or extra heart beat sensation. A sinus tachycardia with resting heart rate of 100\u2013110 beats/min was identified in 18% of patients complaining of palpitation.",

At the first follow-up visit, 46.7% of patients were found to have a lactate dehydrogenase level of >230 U/L. Abnormal chest radiograph findings were reported by the Department of Radiology for 35.4% of patients. These findings included patchy shadows, linear atelectasis, ground glass appearance, reticular marking, and streaky opacities. There was no significant difference in the rate of exertional dyspnea between patients with and patients without abnormal chest radiograph findings (P = .51). For all patients, PCR of urine, nasal, and throat swab samples was negative for SARS-CoV RNA. However, for 1 female patient, PCR of a stool sample obtained 35 days after the onset of SARS symptoms was positive for SARS-CoV RNA. No person who had close contact with that patient after she was discharged from the hospital contracted SARS.",

The finding of abnormal lactate dehydrogenase levels may imply that patients still had not fully recovered from SARS-related tissue damage at the first follow-up visit. We should not overlook the effect of therapy with ribavirin and corticosteroids, which might have contributed to the symptoms and to the abnormal laboratory values. Physicians providing care to patients with SARS during the convalescent period should be aware of the possibility of such abnormal findings.",
