            "text": "PRRSV is an enveloped, positive-stranded RNA virus that is a member of the order Nidovirales, family Arteriviridae, along with lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus of mice, equine arteritis virus, and simian hemorrhagic fever virus. PRRSV causes one of the most economically important diseases of swine which is characterized by severe and sometimes fatal respiratory disease and reproductive failure. Infection with PRRSV also predisposes pigs to infection by bacterial and viral pathogens such as Steptococcus suis, Haemophilus parasuis, Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae, Actinobaccillus pleuropneumoniae, Salmonella spp., and swine influenza virus (Benfield et al., 1992, Done and Paton, 1995, Galina et al., 1994, Groschup et al., 1993, Kawashima et al., 1996, Zeman et al., 1993). The most consistent pathological lesions caused by PRRSV during acute infection are interstitial pneumonia and mild lymphocytic encephalitis (Halbur et al., 1995, Plagemann, 1996, Rossow et al., 1995, Rossow et al., 1996). Tissue macrophages and monocytes are the major target cells during both acute and persistent infection (Molitor et al., 1997), although pneumocytes and epithelial germ cells of the testis have also been shown to be infected (Sur et al., 1996, Sur et al., 1997).",

NF-\u03baB is an inducible transcription factor that plays a key role in inflammation, innate immune responses, the regulation of cell proliferation, and cell survival (Caamano and Hunter, 2002, Li and Verma, 2002). Activation of NF-\u03baB by viral infection is a key trigger to inducing type I interferon (IFN) transcription and other immune responses, including pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, adhesion molecules, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2), and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) (Caamano and Hunter, 2002, Santoro et al., 2003). These molecules are involved in initiating adaptive immune responses by recruiting immune cells to the site of infection. Furthermore, it was recently demonstrated that temporally activated NF-\u03baB confers an essential innate antiviral response against cytoplasmic RNA viruses (human parainfluenza virus type 3 and respiratory syncytial virus) in an IFN-independent manner, showing the importance of NF-\u03baB in the innate antiviral response (Bose et al., 2003).",

The predominant form is a heterodimer composed of p50 and RelA subunits (Ghosh et al., 1998). When inactive, NF-\u03baB is sequestered in the cytoplasm by associating with inhibitory proteins of the I\u03baB family, including I\u03baB\u03b1, I\u03baB\u03b2, and I\u03baB\u03b5, which mask the nuclear localization signal. In response to a wide range of stress signals (e.g., lipopolysaccharide (LPS), tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin (IL)-1, and virus infection), the inactive NF-\u03baB\u2013I\u03baB complex is dissociated via serine phosphorylation by I\u03baB kinase (IKK) and degradation of I\u03baB in proteasomes. These events lead to the unmasking of the nuclear localization sequence of NF-\u03baB, which then allows NF-\u03baB to enter the nucleus and activate transcription of target genes (May and Ghosh, 1998).",

            "text": "While the immune response against PRRSV is not fully characterized, experimental work has demonstrated that the adaptive immune response of PRRSV-infected pigs is generally ineffective (Horter et al., 2002, Murtaugh et al., 2002, Wills et al., 1997, Wills et al., 2003). Specific evidence of an ineffective adaptive immune response includes a slow neutralizing antibody response, which is typically not detected until 3 weeks p.i. (Albina et al., 1998b) and does not reach maximum levels until 10\u201318 weeks p.i. (Nelson et al., 1994, Yoon et al., 1995). While the importance of a cell-mediated response for protection against PRRSV is well accepted, the effectiveness of this response during the early phases of disease also appears to be suboptimal (Murtaugh et al., 2002). For example, the T-cell response to PRRSV is weak and transient and cannot be re-stimulated for more than 4 weeks post-challenge (Molitor et al., 1997, Xiao et al., 2004). Additionally, IFN-\u03b3 responses of PRRSV-infected pigs were relatively weak and increased slowly in comparison to pseudorabies-virus-infected pigs (Meier et al., 2003). Although the precise mechanisms for the ineffective nature of the adaptive immune response to PRRSV are not known, PRRSV evasion of the innate immune responses, such as the type I IFN response, may set the stage for subsequent subversion of the adaptive immune response. Previous studies demonstrated that PRRSV appears to elicit weak innate interferon and cytokine responses compared to other viruses such as swine influenza virus (SIV), porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV), transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) virus, and pseudorabies virus (Albina et al., 1998a, Meier et al., 2003, Van Reeth and Nauwynck, 2000, Van Reeth et al., 1999, Van Reeth et al., 2002). Because NF-\u03baB is important for regulation of type I IFN and cytokines (Lenardo et al., 1989, Mogensen and Paludan, 2001), we hypothesized that PRRSV infection may inhibit NF-\u03baB activation to prevent antiviral responses.",

MARC-145 cells and PAM cultures were either mock-infected or infected with PRRSV at MOI = 0.1, and nuclear extracts were prepared at the indicated times after virus infection. Following infection with PRRSV, NF-\u03baB p65 DNA binding activity increased as PRRSV infection progressed. Although a slight, though statistically significant decrease was consistently observed at 24 h p.i. in PAM cultures (but not MARC-145 cells), the predominant effect of PRRSV infection in both cell types was an increase in NF-\u03baB DNA binding activity. As shown in Fig. 2\n, significant increases in NF-\u03baB DNA binding activity in PRRSV-infected cells were measured, especially at 36 and 48 h p.i, compared with that in mock-infected cells. At 48 h p.i., NF-\u03baB p65 DNA binding activities increased 5.7-fold in MARC-145 cells and 2.2-fold in PAM cultures. The NF-\u03baB DNA binding activity observed in these assays was ablated by an excess of unlabeled competitor, but not by an excess of unlabeled noncompetitor (data not shown).

In some viral infections, binding of the viral particle to a cellular surface receptor is sufficient to trigger signaling cascades that activate NF-\u03baB. To test this possibility, UV-inactivated PRRSV was used to determine if PRRSV binding to its receptor mediates NF-\u03baB activation. As shown in Fig. 3B, UV-inactivation of PRRSV decreased NF-\u03baB activation compared to infection with non-inactivated (fully infectious) PRRSV. NF-\u03baB-regulated gene expression was reduced from 3.34-fold to 1.43-fold at MOI = 1, from 1.99-fold to 1.15 at MOI = 0.1, and from 1.42-fold to 0.96-fold at MOI = 0.01.

Protein levels of I\u03baB\u03b1, I\u03baB\u03b2, and I\u03baB\u03b5 were monitored by Western blot analysis following a time course of infection in MARC-145 cells and PAM cultures.

In MARC-145 cells (Fig. 4A), PRRSV infection resulted in a lower concentration of I\u03baB\u03b1 at 48 h p.i. compared to uninfected control cells, suggesting proteosomal degradation of I\u03baB\u03b1. This correlated with the highest NF-\u03baB activity at 48 h p.i. among the time points tested. However, I\u03baB\u03b1 was still weakly detectable in PRRSV-infected cells at late times p.i. I\u03baB\u03b2 and I\u03baB\u03b5 remained relatively constant at all time points in PRRSV-infected MARC-145 cells.

Despite years of research, little is known about intracellular signaling pathways that play key roles after PRRSV infection and the role of these pathways in PRRSV pathogenesis. The present study demonstrated for the first time that a virus belonging to the Arteriviridae family activates NF-\u03baB in host cells and that potential mechanisms of PRRSV-mediated NF-\u03baB activation are derived from the I\u03baB protein degradation and ROS induction. The major target cells of PRRSV in vivo are tissue macrophages such as PAMs. MARC-145 cells are the only continuous cell line that is highly permissive for PRRSV infection (Kim et al., 1993), and they are typically used for in vitro experiments of PRRSV as well as virus maintenance and attenuation in the laboratory. Viruses could have different effects on NF-\u03baB pathways depending on the cell type infected as demonstrated in Epstein\u2013Barr virus and measles virus infection (Devergne et al., 1996, Dhib-Jalbut et al., 1999, Dreyfus et al., 1999, Fang et al., 2001, Helin et al., 2001). Therefore, in the present study, both MARC-145 cells and PAM cultures were used to determine if PRRSV activates the NF-\u03baB pathway. This study showed that PRRSV infection resulted in increased nuclear translocation of NF-\u03baB and increased DNA binding activity both in MARC-145 cells and PAM cultures. In addition, NF-\u03baB-dependent luciferase expression was significantly increased in MARC-145 cells by PRRSV infection. Although the NF-\u03baB reporter assay was not successfully performed in PAM cultures (due to extremely low transfection efficiencies of PAM cultures), results presented here clearly demonstrated that PRRSV activates the NF-\u03baB pathway in both its natural target cells, PAM, as well as in a continuous cell line, MARC-145 cells.",

            "text": "Viruses have developed various strategies which lead to either activation or inhibition of NF-\u03baB-dependent gene transcription for their benefits (Santoro et al., 2003). The NF-\u03baB pathway can be activated as a protective response of the host to viruses. Therefore, some viruses, such as vaccinia virus, African swine fever virus, influenza A virus, and mengovirus, have evolved strategies to block NF-\u03baB activation in order to evade the innate immune response (Powell et al., 1996, Shisler and Jin, 2004, Wang et al., 2000, Zoll et al., 2002). The NF-\u03baB pathway can also be activated directly by viruses. Viruses including HIV, herpesviruses, hepatitis C virus, encephalomyocarditis virus, reovirus, dengue virus, West Nile virus, and herpes simplex virus have evolved strategies to activate NF-\u03baB to exploit NF-\u03baB for optimized replication, or to control host cell proliferation and survival to maximize viral progeny production (Connolly et al., 2000, Goodkin et al., 2003, Jan et al., 2000, Santoro et al., 2003, Schwarz et al., 1998, Waris et al., 2003). Despite the importance of the NF-\u03baB pathway in immune response, it has not been determined if PRRSV or other arteriviruses modulate this pathway. Previous studies demonstrated that PRRSV induced weak type I IFN responses (Albina et al., 1998a, Lee et al., 2004, Miller et al., 2004, Van Reeth et al., 1999). Therefore, it has been postulated that PRRSV inhibited the NF-\u03baB pathway to evade antiviral responses of host cells. However, the present study provides evidence that PRRSV actually activates the NF-\u03baB pathway in PAMs, which are primary target cells in vivo. The synthesis of type I IFN is regulated trascriptionally and post-transcriptionally, and various transcription factors such as the interferon regulatory factor (IRF) family as well as NF-\u03baB may be involved (Hiscott et al., 2003, Kim et al., 2000b, Taniguchi and Takaoka, 2002, Wathelet et al., 1998). Therefore, it is possible that PRRSV blocks IFN gene expression at transcriptional and/or post-transcription levels but does not inhibit the NF-\u03baB pathway.",

            "text": "Viruses modulate NF-\u03baB activation through various mechanisms. Activation of NF-\u03baB is usually mediated by degradation of I\u03baB\u03b1 in a proteasome-dependent mechanism after phosphorylation by IKK (Hayden and Ghosh, 2004). I\u03baB\u03b1 is generally thought to be the major inhibitor of NF-\u03baB activation. NF-\u03baB activation by influenza virus is mediated by oxidative radicals and activation of IKK as a result of overexpression of viral proteins in endoplasmic reticulum (Flory et al., 2000). The Tax transactivator oncoprotein of human T-lymphotropic virus-1 activates NF-\u03baB by interacting directly with IKK (O'Mahony et al., 2004). HSV-1 induces persistent translocation of NF-\u03baB by I\u03baB\u03b1 degradation (Patel et al., 1998). In this study, Western blot analysis of I\u03baB protein levels revealed that I\u03baB\u03b1 protein was degraded in PRRSV-infected cells and the expression of I\u03baB\u03b1-DN eliminated NF-\u03baB activation by PRRSV. This finding demonstrates that NF-\u03baB activation by PRRSV is mediated at least in part by I\u03baB\u03b1 degradation in MARC-145 cells and the degradation of I\u03baB\u03b1, I\u03baB\u03b2, and I\u03baB\u03b5 in PAM cultures. This result indicates the possibility that different molecules are involved in NF-\u03baB activation in PAM culture infected with PRRSV compared to MARC-145 cells. However, the precise mechanism through which PRRSV influences the I\u03baB degradation in both cells is presently unknown.",

For instance, HIV gp120 and EBV gp350 activate NF-\u03baB signaling pathway through binding to CD4 and CD21 (Bossis et al., 2002, D'Addario et al., 1999, Sugano et al., 1997). However, it is unlikely that NF-\u03baB activation by PRRSV is triggered solely by viral binding to its cognate cellular receptor because the level of NF-\u03baB activation by PRRSV increased as PRRSV replication progression was significantly reduced by UV-inactivation of virus. Therefore, it is possible that PRRSV replication or viral protein expression is a prerequisite for activation of the NF-\u03baB pathway. Alternatively, a soluble factor induced by PRRSV could be responsible for the delayed NF-\u03baB activation.",

            "text": "Previous studies have demonstrated a requirement for NF-\u03baB activation in viral replication. Influenza virus infection is dependent on an active NF-\u03baB signaling pathway (Nimmerjahn et al., 2004). Inhibition of NF-\u03baB activation blocked influenza virus infection of susceptible cells, and cells with low NF-\u03baB activity were poorly susceptible to influenza virus infection (Nimmerjahn et al., 2004). Efficient replication of HSV-1 is promoted by NF-\u03baB activation through the I\u03baB kinase-I\u03baB-p65 pathway (Gregory et al., 2004). However, blocking the NF-\u03baB pathway by overexpression of dominant negative forms of I\u03baB\u03b1 did not interfere with PRRSV replication, suggesting that activation of the NF-\u03baB pathway is non-essential for efficient viral replication. Similarly, other studies with Japanese encephalitis virus or cytomegalovirus demonstrated that NF-\u03baB activation is not required for efficient viral replication (Benedict et al., 2004, Liao et al., 2001). Although NF-\u03baB activation does not play an essential role in PRRSV replication in vitro, it does not mean that NF-\u03baB has no contribution to PRRSV pathogenesis in vivo. Macrophages represent an important source for a variety of soluble immune mediators, including cytokines, chemokines, MMPs, and adhesion molecules which often contain NF-\u03baB binding sites in their promoters (Caamano and Hunter, 2002, Kim and Koh, 2000, Li and Verma, 2002, Mogensen and Paludan, 2001). The MMPs are a group of zinc- and calcium-dependent endopeptidases that degrade an extracellular matrix implicated in tissue remodeling and chronic inflammation. MMPs, especially MMP-2 and MMP-9, play a role in immune responses by promoting infiltration of inflammatory cells (Kumagai et al., 1999). A previous study demonstrated that PRRSV infection significantly increased MMP-2 and MMP-9 which correlated with the appearance of severe histological lung lesions characterized by massive lymphomononuclear cell infiltration and possible local immunosuppression in PRRSV-infected pigs. Therefore, it is possible that MMPs produced in PRRSV-infected cells by NF-\u03baB activation could mediate the influx of new cells of the monocyte/macrophage lineage.",

In cells infected with viruses such as Sindbis virus, reovirus, or dengue virus, apoptosis is facilitated by the activation of NF-\u03baB which was triggered by viral infection (Connolly et al., 2000, Jan et al., 2000, Lin et al., 1995, Lin et al., 1998).

PRRSV has been known to induce apoptosis mostly in bystander cells in vivo (Sirinarumitr et al., 1998).

The resulting ratios were used to compare the expression of the firefly luciferase gene in virus-infected cells to that present in uninfected (mock) cells.",
