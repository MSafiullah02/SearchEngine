Examination for nematode ova and protozoan parasites should be undertaken as well as bacterial culture for Salmonella, Campylobacter and Yersinia. Note that the presence of normal commensal organisms in faeces will not yield information of diagnostic significance -in a clinical setting, it will be impossible to determine whether Clostridia or E. coli are pathogenic or part of the normal bowel flora. Additionally, Salmonella and Campylobacter can often be found in the faeces of clinically unaffected dogs and cats; therefore, the significance of these is not always clear either. Faecal analysis was normal in this case with the exception of an organism like the one seen in the photograph, which was found on examination of a fresh smear made from a faecal swab.",
