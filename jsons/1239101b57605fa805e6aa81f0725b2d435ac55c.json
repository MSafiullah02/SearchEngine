In 1994 first virtual reality-based modelling language was first projected, and used for humanizing the virtual world to overcome the craving over headsets. There exists a vast range of applications offered by this technology, namely; medical training, video gaming, military purposes, etc. Moreover, the virtual reality is an imitation by utilizing the computer/communication devices beyond the boundaries. The majorly employed constituents for the development of virtual reality are the input tools, output devices, and the graphical interface software [1, 2] . The first virtual reality-based environment, for the learning and handling of surgical treatments, has been originated in the 1990s and reported VR as a very cost-effective approach which also allows the medical learners to identify and minimize the errors that occur at any stage of their learnings. In the 20 th century, the concept of virtual reality had further been employed in physical recuperation cases where it has again been proven as a superior quality approach along with the high effectiveness [3, 4] . In recent years, the conception of virtual reality has been broadly employed in the domain of the health sector and effectively proposed in various diseases too. Healthcare in a virtual environment offers the implementation of all the structures of VR activity, namely; period, rigorousness, feedback type, etc. based on the sort of treatment and capability of an individual. In the ongoing pandemic COVID-19 situation, the features and theories proposed by the virtual reality conception can be quite useful in healthcare-related applications and therefore can be effectively employed over to solve or confront many of the issues arising nowadays [5, 6] . The proposed concept of virtual reality will also help provide useful learnings to the COVID-19 medical staffs, which will ultimately improve the efficiency and the accuracy of the healthcare service throughout this pandemic COVID-19. The discussed advantages of virtual reality can play a vital role in effectively and fruitfully solving the cases during ongoing pandemic COVID-19 positively. Figure 1 shows the necessary tools required for the proper implantation of the virtual reality approach for COVID-19. ",

The learning of fracture structure, overall skill development of medical residences, concerns of patient safety and care, ethical views, study support to medical scholars, etc. are the list a few real-life merits attained by employing this emerging concept called as -virtual reality. The simulation-based teaching-learning concept further makes this tactic more practically feasible to explore more new applications of the real world. Based on the past practices made in the domain of medical-related learning, it is always suggested and advised to edify the physicians with the opted simulation contrivances and practices. Some successful, relevant practices attempted are; intrusive hemodynamic observing, ventilation handlings, medical education issues, etc. [7, 8] . These practices ultimately make the working of medical practitioners improved and effective in terms of their working style and flexibility. In the healthcare sector, the training and learning practices based on proposed simulation-based techniques are further observed and suggested as benign, replicable, and economical too. Practically, the virtual reality systems are possessing the VR headsets or multiple projection environment which enables the user to feel, sense, interact with the created realistic like atmosphere which is quite helpful in learning and handling the real-time problems/cases more productively. Classically virtual reality incorporates acoustic and video response, but may similarly permit other kinds of sensual and force response by employing the haptic approach. The learning of medical practitioners can also be improved and developed by providing them with the opportunity to handle the imitation kind of cases over the originated virtual reality background [9, 10] . The primary key benefits offered by offering the VR approach based learnings to the medical domain scholars are explicated in Figure 2 . ",

The coming time is going to be more challenging and competitive for a virtual reality approach in terms of its effectiveness, precision, economic facts, etc. More creativity and sharpness while applying these theories and facts of virtual reality in the real database environment would always be requisite. The further virtual reality application should be targeted over the formation of specifically planned rooms providing with several bigger screen fronts additional to the presently existing small camera screen front in the virtual reality headsets. There have been reports on growing market opportunities for the virtual reality concept to explore itself in the required healthcare domains, especially in the present epidemic situation. This also expresses the proposed utility of the digital and telecommunication facilities in conjunction with the software technologies to answer the critical issues arising out in the present COVID-19 epidemic.",

This approach provides an extensive edge to defend and confront the present epidemic COVID-19 by enhancing the skill, confidence, performance, and overall attitude of healthcare persons. The offered features make a significant improvement in ongoing learning and case handling strategies. It is used as a complementary medical/healthcare edify tool will enhance the execution of medical deliverables. With proper implementation of this approach, researcher, doctors, government, academicians can form a healthier atmosphere to compete with this disease. The concept of virtual reality includes the overall enhancement in the accuracy and the efficacy of the adopted actions, improved working proficiency, well trained medical staffs, etc. which can play a vital role in effectively and fruitfully handling the ongoing pandemic COVID-19 cases positively.",
