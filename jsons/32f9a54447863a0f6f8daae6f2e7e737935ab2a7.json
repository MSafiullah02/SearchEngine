The typical presentation is a respiratory illness with fever, cough, and shortness of breath. Gastrointestinal symptoms are being increasingly recognized and include abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, and nausea. 1 We present a case series of 6 patients who presented to our hospital with COVID-19-associated pneumonia (fever, shortness of breath requiring oxygen, positive COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction [PCR] test, and infiltrates showing on chest radiograph), and upper GI bleeding. The patient and clinical characteristics can be found in Table 1 . The GI manifestations were hematemesis or melena.",

Endoscopy can not only provide therapy but can also allow for risk stratification for re-bleeding that can dictate management. However, the discussion for endoscopy in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia brings about unique management decisions. Although endoscopy can provide therapy if a discrete visible vessel is seen, the risk of the procedure may outweigh the benefit in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.",

Performing upper endoscopy would have likely required general anesthesia with an endotracheal tube in the 5 patients given the patient's oxygen requirements and/or procedure indication (hematemesis). Extubation after the procedure becomes challenging in the setting of pneumonia. In addition, a recent study from China demonstrated an increased mortality rate once a patient with COVID-19 pneumonia is intubated 3 . Although the data for this was in emergent intubation for respiratory failure (and not a elective procedure), the data is compelling. Second, there is a real concern for transmission of the virus to the anesthesiologist, staff, and endoscopist; given aerosolization of respiratory droplets during endoscopy 4 .",

Delaying the endoscopy for 24 hours has recently been shown to not affect 30-day mortality compared to earlier endoscopy 5 . All 6 of our patients responded to conservative management. Cessation of clinical symptoms of acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding was seen in all of our patients in combination with stabilization of hemoglobin.
