For example, the system algorithmically calculated the minimum number of blood tubes required to perform all analyses (taking into consideration not only the total volume of blood, but also intra-laboratory sample handling and aliquoting).

The following month, SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing grew exponentially to >750 tests per day, at which point both traditional analytical infrastructure and reagents became limiting factors (Figure 1). To manage the acute crisis, we established a crisis management team (CMT) consisting of clinical pathology staff specialized in microbiology and in LIS development. The CMT readily implemented a triage system to reduce stress on reagents, and addressed key bottlenecks in the pre-analytical and post-analytical phase. Maximum upscaling in terms of FTE's was estimated to be an additional 20 FTE's for the pre-analytical phase, five for the analytical phase and 13 FTE's for the post-analytical phase (Figure 2). These FTE were divided among three different shifts. After stabilization of the sample flow, a fraction of staff was reallocated to perform test validation and scientific and to engage in epidemiological studies.",
