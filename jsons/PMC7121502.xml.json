The roots of this failure lie in the problem of defining asthma, and the consequent difficulty of reproducible and conclusive case ascertainment; in the transient nature of the principal symptoms, the fact that asthma is heterogeneous in its underlying pathophysiology; and in the absence of simple sensitive and specific markers for the condition. However, the epidemiology of asthma and allergy is currently undergoing a rapid expansion and has shifted attention from traditional risk factors which may exacerbate asthma, to protective factors that may prevent respiratory allergies and asthma. This growth of interest is occurring in the context of major concerns about the increasing burden of respiratory allergy and asthma morbidity, and the realization that previous etiological theories based on animal models of asthma and clinical observations do not appear to explain the large global increases in asthma prevalence.",

Individuals that are not sensitized to these allergens will usually not show symptoms even with very high exposure. Symptoms in sensitized subjects are caused by inflammatory reactions initiated by allergen-specific IgE antibodies present in the airways.

It is usually assessed by skin prick tests or specific and/or total serum IgE against common allergens (see Sect. 56.4.3), and it can therefore be defined either in terms of skin prick text positivity or elevated serum IgE levels (Pearce et al. 1999). Depending on the definition, about 20% to 40% of people in affluent countries are atopic. In population studies, atopy is often associated with an increased risk of asthma (Pearce et al. 1999), but the association is stronger in \u201cWesternized\u201d countries than in developing countries (Weinmayr et al. 2007).",

Thus, a diagnosis of asthma is made on the basis of the clinical history, combined with physical examination and respiratory function tests over a period of time. Several studies have found the prevalence of physician-diagnosed asthma to be substantially lower than the prevalence of asthma symptoms in the community (e.g., Asher et al. 1998). This is not surprising since a clinical diagnosis of asthma can only be made if a person presents him or herself to a doctor. This requires an initial self-assessment of the symptoms (in terms of severity and frequency), as well as access to a doctor once a self-assessment has been made. Several medical consultations may then be required.

Measurements of lung function are the most frequently used and provide important information on airflow limitation including variability, reversibility, and severity. Airflow limitation is most often measured using spirometry or a peak (expiratory) flow (PEF) meter. Spirometry is the preferred method and forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), and peak expiratory flow (PEF) can be derived from this method as indicators for airway obstruction. Pre- and postbronchodilator treatment is important since it will establish whether obstruction is reversible and will distinguish it from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in which obstruction is mostly irreversible. Reversibility of airway obstruction defined as FEV1 of \u2265 12% and \u2265 200mL from the prebronchodilator value is generally accepted as a valid indication of asthma (GINA 2006). However, due to the highly variable nature of the condition, repeated lung function tests are required. PEF meters are inexpensive and easy to use, but they are less precise than spirometry and may underestimate the degree of airflow limitation (Aggarwal et al. 2006).",

However, as emphasized in the updated 2010 GINA guidelines (GINA 2010), asthma involves both the severity of the disease and its responsiveness to treatment. Therefore, asthma could present with severe symptoms and poor lung function but could become completely controlled with low-dose treatment. Thus, the classification of severity had poor predictive value for what treatment was required and what the response to treatment might be. As a consequence, the 2010 guidelines do no longer include the 2006 asthma severity classification. However, it is still a commonly used classification in many epidemiological studies.\n",

This approach allows a large number of participants to be surveyed without great cost, in a short time period. Wheezing, chest tightness, breathlessness, and coughing are all symptoms clinically associated with asthma, but epidemiological studies have shown that wheezing is the most important symptom for the identification of asthma, and the majority of questionnaires used to assess asthma prevalence are based on this symptom (Pearce et al. 1998a) (see Sect. 56.4.1 for more detail).",

            "text": "Ten years ago it was widely believed that asthma was an atopic disease caused by allergen exposure. The fundamental etiological mechanism was that allergen exposure, particularly in infancy, produced atopic sensitization, and continued exposure resulted in asthma through the development of eosinophilic airways inflammation, bronchial hyperresponsiveness and reversible airflow obstruction. In recent years, it has become increasingly evident that this picture is, at best, too simplistic (Ronchetti et al. 2007; Weinmayr et al. 2007). A systematic review of population-based studies (Pearce et al. 1999) has shown that the proportion of asthma cases that are attributable to atopy (defined as skin prick test positivity) is usually less than one-half. Standardized comparisons across populations or time periods also show only weak and inconsistent associations between the prevalence of asthma and the prevalence of atopy. For instance, a comparison of asthma and atopy in 9- to 11-year-olds in Albania and the United Kingdom (Priftanji et al. 2001) showed large differences in the prevalence of current wheeze (4.4% and 9.7%, respectively) and exercise-induced bronchial reactivity (0.8% and 5.4%), but not in skin prick test positivity (15.0% and 17.8%), suggesting that large variations in asthma prevalence can occur without differences in frequency of atopy. This was confirmed by the International Study of Allergies and Asthma in Children (ISAAC; see Sects. 56.5.3 and 56.5.4) which showed that the association between atopy and asthma symptoms differed strongly among populations but increased with the level of economic development (Weinmayr et al. 2007). In this study, the proportion of current wheeze attributable to atopy ranged from 0% in Ankara (Turkey) to 93.8% in Guangzhou (China); the overall proportion of asthma cases that were attributable to atopy was only 41% in affluent countries and 20% in non-affluent countries. This is consistent with a recent study among 3,960 children in Ecuador which found a population attributable fraction of only 2.4% for recent wheeze and atopy (Moncayo et al. 2010). A similar study in Salvador, Brazil suggested the proportion of asthma attributable to atopy to be 24.5% (Souza da Cunha et al. 2010), which, although higher than in Ecuador, is substantially lower than the 50% in most Western countries. The European Community Respiratory Health Survey (see Sects. 56.5.2 and 56.5.4) found that the proportion of asthma attributable to atopy in adults ranged from 4% to 61% between individual study centers with an overall estimate of only 30% for all centers combined (Sunyer et al. 2004). Finally, time trend studies have shown different patterns for atopy and astma in the same geographical areas. For example, a recent study in Sweden in 7- to 8-year-olds showed a significant increase in allergic sensitization over a 10-year period (1996\u20132006) despite asthma symptoms remaining stable over the same period (Bjerg et al. 2010).",

Thus, evidence from studies of eosinophilia and asthma is consistent with that from studies of atopy and asthma: in both instances, at most about one-half of asthma cases appears to be due to \u201callergic\u201d mechanisms.

Briefly, the sensitization process involves the adaptive (or acquired) immune system whereby allergens interact with dendritic cells in the airway mucosa which migrate to the regional lymph nodes where the allergens are presented to B and T cells. This results (through T-helper-2 (Th2) responses) in the production of allergen-specific IgE. Once allergic, a subject can develop symptoms minutes after being exposed. This is known as the early phase allergic reaction, and symptoms develop as a result of mast cell degranulation and release of inflammatory mediators through allergen IgE antibody complexes at the surface of the mast cells, causing contraction of bronchial smooth muscle and edema in the airways. Clinically, this results in a decreased lung function and symptoms of wheeze, shortness of breath, chest tightness, and coughing.",

Patients may have severe and persistent asthma in the absence of eosinophilic inflammation and may experience an exacerbation of asthma without an increase in eosinophilic inflammation (Turner et al. 1995). Repeated assessments of airway inflammation over time have shown that the non-eosinophilic asthma phenotype is reproducible both in the short (4 weeks) and long term (1 to 5 years) (Simpson et al. 2006). However, the underlying mechanisms of non-eosinophilic/non-allergic asthma are not fully understood. One study in 93 non-smoking adult asthmatics found elevated sputum airway eosinophilia in 41% of all asthma cases, 20% had elevated levels of neutrophils, 8% had a mixed inflammatory profile with both cell types being elevated, and the remainder (31%) had no signs of airway inflammation with eosinophil and neutrophil levels both being within the normal range (Simpson et al. 2006). This suggests that asthma can be categorized into four inflammatory subtypes based on the sputum eosinophil and neutrophil proportions: eosinophilic asthma, neutrophilic asthma, mixed granulocytic asthma, and paucigranulocytic asthma (Simpson et al. 2006).",

This poses several problems with the use of \u201cdiagnosed asthma\u201d in asthma prevalence studies, since the diagnosis of \u201cvariable airflow obstruction\u201d usually requires several medical consultations over an extended period. It is therefore not surprising that several studies have found the prevalence of physician-diagnosed asthma to be substantially lower than the prevalence of asthma symptoms. For example, Ehrlich et al. (1995), in a survey in school children in Cape Town, found that among children with more than 12 attacks of wheezing in the previous 12 months, only 60% were reported as asthmatic and only 55% as receiving regular treatment.",

Strictly speaking, the term exposure refers to the presence of a substance (e.g., house dust mite allergen) in the external environment, whereas the term dose refers to the amount of substance that reaches susceptible targets within the body, such as the airways. In some situations (e.g., in a coal mine), measurements of external exposures may be strongly correlated with internal dose, whereas in other situations (e.g., indoor exposure to house dust mite allergen), the dose may depend on individual lifestyle and activities and may therefore be only weakly correlated with the environmental exposure levels. However, in this chapter we use the term \u201cexposure\u201d in the very general sense to denote any attribute or agent which may increase the risk of experiencing the outcome under study. It includes demographic factors (age, sex, ethnicity, social class) and genetic factors as well as environmental risk factors (measured externally and/or internally).",

The risk of developing sensitization to an allergen may be much greater if the duration of exposure is long and/or the exposure is high, and the total cumulative exposure may therefore be important. However, once a person has become sensitized, then the concentration may be crucial in provoking an acute attack, and such attacks may occur after exposure of a relatively short duration. For protracted etiological processes, the time pattern of exposure may be important, and it is possible to assess this by examining the separate effects of exposures in various time windows prior to the occurrence and recognition of clinical disease (Pearce 1992). For example, several studies have found that exposure to environmental tobacco smoke in the first years of life may be as relevant as current exposures with regard to current asthma symptoms (e.g., Shaw et al. 1994). Similarly, it has been suggested that occupational asthma is most likely to occur after about 1 to 3 years of exposure to a sensitizing agent (Anto et al. 1996).",

Thus, if positive findings do occur, one can be confident that these are not due to inaccuracies in the exposure data; however, if no association (or only a weak association) is found between exposure and disease, then the possibility of non-differential information bias should be considered. In general, the aim of exposure assessment (see also chapter 10.1007/978-0-387-09834-0_12 of this handbook) is to (1) ensure that the exposure data is of equal quality in the groups being compared and (2) ensure that the data is of the best possible quality given the former restriction.",

Thus, if the aim is to measure historical exposures, then historical information on exposure surrogates may be more valid than direct measurements of current exposure or dose levels. This situation has long been recognized in occupational epidemiology, where the use of work history records in combination with a job-exposure matrix (based on historical exposure measurements of work areas rather than individuals) is usually considered to be more valid than current exposure measurements (whether based on environmental measurements or biomarkers) if the aim is to estimate historical exposure levels (Checkoway et al. 2004).

However, atopy may also modify the effect of dust mite allergen exposure, that is, non-asthmatic atopic persons may be more likely to develop asthma symptoms than non-atopic persons at the same level of dust mite exposure.

More recently, it has been suggested that FENO measurements can be used to optimize corticosteroid dose without negatively impacting upon asthma control (Pijnenburg et al. 2005). Although measuring FENO shows promise in the diagnosis and management of asthma, other factors not directly related to asthma such as smoking, atopy, height, and sex affect FENO levels (Kharitonov et al. 1995; Olin et al. 2006; Taylor et al. 2007; Dressel et al. 2008). Furthermore, increased FENO levels may only be associated with atopic or eosinophilic asthma, as patients with non-atopic or non-eosinophilic asthma appear to have normal FENO levels, regardless of disease severity (Porsbjerg et al. 2009). Thus, despite FENO being used in large population studies, it is a poor single diagnostic marker of asthma as has been demonstrated in community-based population studies (Travers et al. 2007).

Lung function is measured in between each inhalation period and subjects given inhaled \u03b22-beta agonist if their FEV1 drops below 15 to 20% of baseline. The subjects are asked to cough up any sputum after each dose of hypertonic saline and samples will be used to analyze cell types and inflammatory markers and mediators (e.g., IL4, IL5, IL8, ECP). These tests can be done in children from age 8 to 10 years and adults but given the laborious procedures involved the population sample size will necessarily be limited. An increasing number of population-based studies are being conducted using sputum induction testing, and these and previous studies have clearly shown that asthma consists of at least two inflammatory phenotypes (see Sect. 56.3.1). Further studies are currently in progress to assess the clinical and epidemiological importance of these findings.",

In addition, non-volatile substances (i.e., proteins including a number of cytokines) in the lower respiratory tract can be transported in the form of aerosols in exhaled breath. Successful collection of EBC has been reported using a variety of devices including teflon-lined tubing in an ice bath and specially designed double-wall glass condenser systems (Hoffmeyer et al. 2009). EBC has been shown to contain a range of inflammatory markers and mediators, including nitric oxide, hydrogen peroxide, nitrites, eicosanoids, and various cytokines (Kharitonov and Barnes 2006; Hoffmeyer et al. 2009). The significance of breath condensate analyses is that this technique is straightforward, non-invasive, and completely safe and could be widely used in population-based surveys of asthma (including young children in whom more invasive procedures are not possible). However, EBC results have been highly variable between and within laboratories, and further validation work is therefore required before the technique can \u201croutinely\u201d be used in epidemiological studies of respiratory allergies and asthma (Czebe et al. 2008).",

Nevertheless, most studies, which have determined the prevalence of asthma symptoms using the same methodology in the same community at different times, have reported that asthma prevalence has increased in recent decades and that the magnitude of the increase has in some cases been substantial (Table 56.2). Although methodological differences in these studies make it difficult to compare the magnitude of the differences in asthma prevalence between countries, the trend of increasing prevalence among populations in countries of widely differing lifestyles, and ethnic groups is generally consistent.\n",

During 1926\u20131961, the prevalence of asthma recorded at call up examinations was in the range of 0.02\u20130.08%. However, asthma prevalence increased from 0.29% in 1966 to 1.79% in 1989. The authors concluded that the increase was unlikely to be due to improved diagnostic methods and that much of the increase was likely to be real. This conclusion was strengthened by a concomitant rise (from 0.12% in 1966 to 0.75% in 1989) in exemptions and discharges due to asthma. This study is consistent with other evidence that the increases in asthma prevalence in industrialized countries appear to have commenced after the Second World War, particularly in the 1960s and 1970s.",

An important component of this research process involves standardized international prevalence comparisons (Pearce et al. 1998a). The key problem is to gain information on large numbers of people in random samples collected in a comparable manner across social groups, regions, and countries. Thus, comparisons of asthma prevalence are increasingly being based on a simple comparison of symptom prevalence in a questionnaire survey in a large number of people, followed by more intensive testing of factors related to asthma (e.g., BHR) and risk factors for asthma (skin prick test positivity, serum IgE, and environmental exposures) in a subsample, and a repeat of the prevalence survey over time. This approach has been used in the international survey of asthma prevalence in adults (Burney et al. 1994) and in the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (Pearce et al. 1993; Asher et al. 1995; Ellwood et al. 2005).",

Thus, it is not inherited in the simple Mendelian fashion that is characteristic of single-gene disorders. A particular genetic factor may affect one or more aspects of the complex etiological processes potentially involved in asthma including atopic sensitization, bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR), airway inflammation, innate immunity, etc. Whether this genetic potential is expressed will depend on various factors, including whether sufficient exposure to environmental factors occurs. Investigating possible genes for the individual etiological factors is also fraught with difficulties, since control of these factors (e.g., IgE production and BHR) are also multifactorial (Zamel et al. 1996). Also, as noted earlier, asthma is an extremely heterogeneous disease including a variety of phenotypical and clinical manifestations which are likely to be associated with different (combinations of) genes. Another potential source of phenotypic variability is that asthma development, exacerbations, and progression may involve different environmental triggers and genetic factors.",

However, the concordance was still only 19%, and even this may in part be due to similar environmental exposures in monozygotic twins, including a common intrauterine environment (Godfrey et al. 1994). Other large population studies have yielded similar findings, but this may be because these studies have determined asthma on the basis of questionnaires or hospital and pharmacy records, whereas smaller studies with more intensive diagnostic methods have generally yielded higher concordance (Sandford et al. 1996).",

However, these associations were relatively weak and the genetic variants very common. As a result, despite these associations being highly statistically significant, the sensitivity and specificity for identifying asthmatics based on these genetic variants was poor (Ober and Yao 2011). Also, many \u201casthma genes\u201d previously indentified in candidate gene association studies (using a hypothesis-driven approach) were not replicated in these large GWAS meta-analyses. This may be because GWAS studies are not able to detect some of the rarer variants (Michel et al. 2010), or, alternatively, the previously indentified candidates may be false-positive results. Whatever the reason, it is clear that our knowledge of the genetics of asthma is currently still very limited, but future GWAS for asthma on well-defined asthma phenotypes may shed some more light on the importance of genetics in the development of asthma.",

One possible explanation is that the average age of onset in childhood and adolescence may be later in females. Levels of cord blood IgE are lower at birth in girls than in boys (Weeke 1992), indicating a lower risk of the subsequent development of asthma. Some authors have noted that boys have smaller airways than girls, relative to lung size, and that this may explain the greater frequency and severity of lower respiratory tract illness in boys, even though infection rates are similar for both sexes (Martinez et al. 1988). Alternatively, it is possible that boys have more exposure to factors that increase asthma incidence or duration. The relatively higher prevalence (or smaller reduction in prevalence) in females than in males after puberty could be due to hormonal influences on allergic predisposition, airway size, inflammation, and smooth muscle vascular functions (Redline and Gold 1994). Premenstrual asthma may be especially relevant to the hormonal involvement of asthma since it may not only cause asthma exacerbations but may thereby affect the frequency and duration of asthma symptoms, resulting in an increase in the prevalence of \u201ccurrent asthma.\u201d",

There has been less evidence of social class differences as the diagnosis of asthma has become more widespread (Littlejohns and Macdonald 1993), even though diagnostic labeling of wheezing in adults differs by social class (Littlejohns et al. 1989). However, severe asthma appears to be more common in children in the lower social classes (Stewart et al. 2001) and in some disadvantaged ethnic groups (Pattemore et al. 2004), and low socioeconomic status is associated with hospital admissions for asthma (Watson et al. 1996) and with reduced lung function in adults. This could represent either a greater prevalence of asthma in disadvantaged groups, or increased severity due to environmental factors (e.g., environmental tobacco smoke, nutrition, occupational exposures) (Eagan et al. 2002; Ellison-Loschmann et al. 2007), or inadequate disease management and poor access to health care (Ellison-Loschmann and Pearce 2006).",

Like asthma, the prevalence of overweight and obesity has increased dramatically in the past few decades in many regions of the world (Burney 2002). Studies have shown associations between body weight and asthma in both adults (Braback et al. 2005) and children (von Mutius et al. 2001). Prospective studies of children suggest that obesity precedes asthma signaling a causal link (Gilliland et al. 2003; Gold et al. 2003), as do studies showing associations between asthma and both weight gain and weight loss in adults (Hakala et al. 2000). Nonetheless, some studies have failed to show an association (Brenner et al. 2001), while others showed an association only in one sex (Mannino et al. 2006). Several reported an association only with respiratory symptoms (e.g., wheeze), but not BHR (Bustos et al. 2005), although this may merely indicate that obesity increases asthma risk through mechanisms other than BHR. Obesity may also increase severity in subjects with preexisting asthma (Akerman et al. 2004).",

In particular, it has been speculated that the increase in asthma prevalence may be due to a change in dietary patterns in the past few decades, that is, as cultures have become more \u201cwesternized,\u201d they have shifted from a tradition of growing and consuming locally grown foods to consuming more processed foods with an overall increase in the intake of refined sugars, fats, and additives, as well as a reduction in the intake of fresh fruits, vegetables, and fish. Several observational studies have shown protective effects of fruit and vegetables, whole grain products, and fish (Devereux 2007), and these findings are consistent with an ecological analysis of the ISAAC Phase I survey (Ellwood et al. 2001). Fruit, vegetables, and wholegrain products are rich in antioxidants and may reduce airway inflammation by protecting the airways against both endogenous and exogenous oxidants (Devereux 2007). Fish oils are rich in n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids which may also protect against airway inflammation and subsequent symptoms of asthma (Devereux 2007). However, dietary supplement studies focusing on antioxidants and n-3 fatty acids have not shown convincing evidence of a protective effect on allergies and asthma (Reisman et al. 2006; Almqvist et al. 2007).",

An association between measures of distance to major roads or traffic density and asthma symptoms has been found in a number of European countries (WHO 2005). Also, a large number of studies have reported associations between direct measurements of air pollution levels and exacerbation of preexisting asthma, both in children and adults (Boezen et al. 1999; WHO 2005). Some studies, including a recent birth cohort study (Brauer et al. 2007), have also suggested that air pollution may cause new onset of asthma and allergic disease. In particular, several large prospective studies have suggested a role for ozone (McDonnell et al. 1999; McConnell et al. 2002), although significant associations with some asthma outcomes were also shown for PM2.5, soot, and NO2 (Brauer et al. 2007). Nonetheless, although it is clear that air pollution can provoke exacerbations in preexisting asthma and a positive association between outdoor air pollution and asthma prevalence at the population level has been shown (Asher et al. 1998), the weight of evidence does not currently support a major role for outdoor air pollution as a cause of the initial development of asthma.",

In particular, several recent reviews and meta-analyses differ in their conclusions about the role of second-hand tobacco smoke (SHS). The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and Californian EPA concluded that SHS was causally associated with the development of asthma in children (EPA 1992; OEHHA 1997). The 2006 Surgeon General\u2019s report on \u201chealth effects from involuntary exposure to tobacco smoke\u201d (DHHS 2006) concluded that the evidence was suggestive, but not sufficient to infer a causal relationship. This analysis was based on a previous meta-analysis conducted by Strachan and Cook (1998) and did not include the most recent epidemiological studies. However, the more recent meta-analysis including studies published between 1970 and 2005 concluded that household SHS exposure was positively and consistently associated with the incidence or new onset asthma (Vork et al. 2007) not only in younger but also older children.",

However, much higher estimates have also been reported. For example, a study of the entire employed population of Finland from 1986 to 1998 estimated the attributable fraction of adult-onset asthma due to occupation to be 29% for men and 17% for women (Karjalainen et al. 2001). More than 250 agents have been identified as causes of OA (Department of Health and Senior Services, State of New Jersey 2006).

With the recognition of causal environmental exposures such as pollen (Blackley 1873) and house dust (Osler 1892) in the latter half of the nineteenth century and the increased understanding of the inflammatory mechanisms underlying asthma in the second half of the twentieth century (Holgate 2004), the notion that asthma was caused by emotional stress slowly lost support. Thus, many asthma researchers currently regard emotional stress as predominantly a consequence of the disease or as an external factor which may trigger exacerbations in those with preexisting asthma. Associations between stress/anxiety and asthma in (cross-sectional) epidemiological studies are therefore generally dismissed as examples of reverse causation.

The subsequent change in levels of neurohormones (and in particular endogenous glucocorticoids) has considerable immunomodulatory effects, including an atopy (or Th2)-biased response favoring allergic outcomes (von Hertzen 2002). In addition to neuroimmunomodulatory effects, it is plausible that direct neurogenic mechanisms may underlie at least part of the association between stress and asthma (Miller et al. 2009).",

If there is a causal association, most of the evidence points toward endotoxin, but other pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) may be equally (or more) important. There is evidence that exposure to peptidoglycans, CpG-containing DNA, and certain viruses may also reduce the risk of atopic disease (Douwes et al. 2004). The evidence for these PAMPs is, however, scarce.",

            "text": "Although the specific immune mechanisms are not clear, it is believed that microbial exposure may affect T lymphocytes which have an important function in controlling immune responses, including help for B cell production of antibodies (IgE, IgG, IgA, IgM). T-helper-2 (Th2) cells stimulate B cells to produce IgE upon allergen stimulation, whereas T-helper-1 cells (Th1) inhibit this process. The initial interpretation was that growing up in a more hygienic environment with less microbial exposure may enhance atopic (Th2) immune responses, whereas microbial pressure would drive the response of the immune system \u2013 which is known to be skewed in an atopic Th2 direction during fetal and perinatal life \u2013 into a Th1 direction and away from its tendency to develop atopic immune responses. More recently, an alternative interpretation has been offered which involves inadequate immunoregulation by T regulatory cells wich control both Th1 and Th2 immune responses. Active regulation through T regulatory cells is believed to be critical in maintaining tolerance to allergens through a balanced Th1/Th2 immune response. The hypothesis is that a lack of microbial exposure may result in reduced immune suppression of T regulatory cells allowing upregulation of both Th1 and Th2 immunity, thus rendering subjects more susceptible to developing allergies (as well as Th1 conditions including autoimmune disease which has also increased in prevalence in the past few decades). However, the immunological mechanisms underlying the observed epidemiological associations remain largely unclear (Romagnani 2004).",

            "text": "Several studies have shown that the presence of pets in the home early in life is inversely associated with atopy in children (Hesselmar et al. 1999). Other studies have also shown a protective effect of pet ownership and asthma, for example, de Meer et al. (2004b) showed that having had a cat before the age of 18 protected against atopy to outdoor allergens, airway hyperreactivity, current wheeze, and current asthma. These results should, however, be interpreted with caution, since avoidance behavior (removal of pets in the families with sensitized and/or symptomatic children) may have contributed to this inverse association. However, in a longitudinal study in which subjects with childhood asthma at enrolment were excluded from the analyses, the protective effects actually increased (de Meer et al. 2004b), whereas a decrease would be expected if selective avoidance was a major issue. There are also studies that have found no association, or a positive association, between pet exposure and asthma, despite showing an inverse association with atopy (Apelberg et al. 2001; Kerkhof et al. 2009). In other parts of the world (Guinea-Bissau and Nepal), it has been shown that pigs and cattle in the home are associated with less atopy (Shaheen et al. 1996; Melsom et al. 2001). Thus, although the evidence for a protective effect on atopy is reasonably consistent, currently, it is unclear whether pets can also protect against asthma.",

These protective effects for allergies and asthma have also been observed in adult farmers (Leynaert et al. 2001; Kauffmann et al. 2002; Kilpelainen et al. 2002; Portengen et al. 2002, 2005; Braback et al. 2004; Eduard et al. 2004a,b; Koskela et al. 2005; Radon et al. 2006; Chen et al. 2007; Douwes et al. 2007; Smit et al. 2007, 2008) despite the increased risks of other respiratory conditions such as COPD, reduced lung function, and farmers\u2019 lung (Schenker et al. 1998). The fact that similar effects are found in low-income countries (Weinberg 2000; Viinanen et al. 2007), where people have less opportunity to move away from farming because of allergies and asthma, further suggests that selection effects are unlikely to explain the often substantial lower risk in farming communities (Douwes et al. 2009).",

Farm animals are associated with high exposures to microorganisms, in particular bacterial endotoxin (Douwes et al. 2002b). Also, an upregulation of several innate immune receptors specific for microbial products (TLRs and CD14) has been shown in farmers\u2019 children (Ege et al. 2006) suggesting that microorganisms and microbial products may be involved. In fact, a recent study showed that exposure to a wide variety of environmental microorganisms as well as exposures to specific fungal and bacterial species explained a substantial fraction of the inverse association between farm upbringing and asthma (Ege et al. 2011). Exposures early in life including the prenatal period appear particularly protective, although continued exposure may be required to maintain optimal protection (Douwes et al. 2007).",

The etiological mechanisms are unclear, but probiotic bacteria or other currently unidentified non-microbial components in farm milk may play a role. Evidence from other populations with anthroposophic lifestyles which are characterized by (among other things) diets rich in (probiotic) microbes (Alm et al. 1999) suggests that this protective effect may not be limited only to the farming environment, although the findings of these studies have not always been consistent (Alfven et al. 2006).

However, since about one-half of asthma cases involve non-atopic/allergic mechanisms (Pearce et al. 1999), it is questionable whether the hygiene hypothesis on its own can explain the large increases observed over the last decades or the global prevalence patterns, particularly since there is some evidence that non-atopic asthma may have increased more than atopic asthma (Thomsen et al. 2004). Also, although housing conditions are unlikely to have become more hygienic in United States inner city populations, asthma prevalence has increased significantly in those populations, particularly among African Americans living in poverty (Crater et al. 2001). Finally, the hygiene hypothesis is unlikely to explain why asthma prevalence is now apparently falling in affluent countries, as exposures to factors that have previously been identified as being \u201cprotective\u201d (family size, endotoxin exposure, infectious diseases, pets) are likely to have decreased in more recent times rather than increased. These findings thus further emphasize the potential limitations of the current hygiene hypothesis (Douwes and Pearce 2008). Nevertheless, whatever mechanism is involved, it is becoming increasingly clear that the \u201cpackage\u201d of changes associated with westernization may be contributing to the global increases in asthma susceptibility and prevalence.",

Thus, although we have learnt a great deal about immunology in mice in the past few decades, these mouse models have provided only limited understanding of the underlying immunological mechanisms of human asthma. Nonetheless, most biomedical research on asthma continues to be conducted in mice. Similarly, the overemphasis of allergen exposure as the \u201ccausal\u201d factor of asthma, as well as the lack of appreciation of the heterogeneity of asthma in many epidemiological studies, has guided biomedical and clinical research into studying (almost exclusively) allergic mechanisms and allergy-specific treatment options, with very little consideration of other potentially relevant mechanisms. In particular, there are now several studies suggesting that corticosteroid treatment is less or non-effective in asthma phenotypes that do not involve allergic mechanisms and subsequent non-eosinophilic airway inflammation (Berry et al. 2007), despite these phenotypes being very common (Douwes et al. 2002a; Simpson et al. 2007). Also, studies of asthma genetics continue to be based on populations of mixed phenotypes limiting the potential to find meaningful results. This \u201ctunnel vision\u201d has led to assumptions that findings in Western countries can be extrapolated to the rest of the world, and it has taken international collaborations such as the ISAAC study, to show that, for example, the strong associations between atopy and asthma symptoms that have been repeatedly observed in Western countries are not so evident in low- and middle-income countries (Weinmayr et al. 2007). Thus, considering the complex interplay between environmental exposures, genetic susceptibility, immunological mechanisms, as well as social and cultural factors involved in asthma development \u2013 and indeed most non-communicable diseases \u2013 an interdisciplinary approach bringing together expertise from each of these disciplines is most desirable, as it is likely to open up new avenues of cutting edge research, yielding greater explanatory power, more efficient use of research funding, and more efficient translation into disease prevention. Also, a closer link with biomedical research will ensure the development of more sensitive and valid methods that can be widely applied in population studies to improve both disease definition (including the assessment and recognition of disease phenotypes) and relevant exposures.",

However, although epidemiology is well placed to take the lead in developing interdisciplinary research, we also see a role for more \u201ctraditional\u201d epidemiology.

Studies such as ISAAC (see Sect. 56.5.3) are an excellent example where the use of a one-page questionnaire conducted in more than one million children worldwide has made a major impact on how we think about asthma etiology (Enarson 2005).",

            "text": "Despite decades of intensive biomedical and epidemiological research, the etiology and pathogenesis of asthma is still poorly understood. In particular, a large number of potential risk factors for asthma have been identified including genetic factors, allergen exposure, demographic parameters, diet, obesity, indoor and outdoor pollution, passive and active tobacco smoking, occupational exposures, viral infections, stress/anxiety, and the use of paracetamol (acetaminophen). However, none of these risk factors on their own appears to explain the substantial global increases in asthma prevalence observed in the last few decades. They also cannot explain the significant differences in asthma prevalence between countries. Recent studies have shown that the increase in asthma prevalence appears to have leveled off in many high-income countries, with some even showing a decrease. The reasons for this are also unclear. As a consequence, a single target for intervention has not (yet) been identified.",

Recent epidemiological studies have provided innovative theories of the etiology of asthma, such as the hygiene hypothesis, which have considerable potential to guide the development of feasible primary (and secondary) prevention options. However, given the complex gene-environment interactions (Vercelli 2009) and diverse asthma phenotypes (Douwes et al. 2002a), any single type of intervention is unlikely to prevent all or even a substantial proportion of asthma cases \u2013 a \u201cone size fits all\u201d approach is unlikely to work. Epidemiology (alongside other disciplines) has a major role to play in developing new theories regarding asthma causation and the subsequent development and evaluation of effective prevention strategies. However, for these efforts to be maximally effective, they would need to be part of a multidisciplinary program that includes expertise (in addition to epidemiology) in biomedical, clinical, genetic, psychological, and other disciplines.",
