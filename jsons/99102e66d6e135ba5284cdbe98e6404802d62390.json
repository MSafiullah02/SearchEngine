The long checklist group performed procedural variables (e.g. call 911, first pulse check, compression rate) correctly 33% of the time compared to either 13% or 14% of the time in the short or no checklist groups (p<0.02 and<0.01 respectively). The three groups did not show differences in the quality of compressions or ventilations as registered by a recording manikin. In addition, the long checklist group performed at least as well in all measured aspects of BLS (procedural or quality of compressions and ventilations), suggesting no detrimental effects of using a checklist. This study is a well-designed RCT, but of limited applicability to the current ILCOR question as it evaluated only lay rescuers performing simulated BLS.",

The first of this series (Runciman, 1993, 579) used consensus opinion to develop a mnemonic algorithm to focus attention on common anesthesia problems during times of crisis. The developed tool was applied retrospectively to a sample of 1,301 voluntarily reported anesthesia incidents. The method of analysis involved three investigators using their professional judgment to decide if the algorithm would have led to a better outcome during the reported incident. They determined that the algorithm would have diagnosed the underlying problem in 99% of the incidents and would have led to a better outcome in 12.6% of cases. A similar process was applied to various anesthetic complications requiring problem specific algorithms (e.g. the septic patient) with results favoring the use of these sub-algorithms (Bacon, 2005, e18 Williamson, 2005, e17) . While providing a useful framework for the development of a checklist for crisis situations, the tools have only been validated using expert opinion applied to a retrospective convenience sample of anesthetic events, significantly limiting its applicability to the current question. \u2022 LOE 5 : Favorable.
