For instance, vaccines obviously make the individuals less susceptible to a contagious disease and also they reduce the chances that non-vaccinated people will get the disease. Clearly, vaccination is good for the whole society since with only few unvaccinated individuals the transmission of the disease cannot be maintained and the risk of pandemic will be low. In a free market, this type of goods are either under-consumed or under-produced due to free-riders as well as incorrect pricing policies or ignorance of external benefits. Thus, there is a need for regulating the environment of these goods by a central authority (government or social planner) so that their consumption is raised towards a socially desirable level. Here, the main goal of the central authority is to design and fund an intervention scheme that triggers the actors of the supply chain to take decisions for the benefit of the society. In this study, we explore the problem of designing an intervention strategy for a public-interest good that has uncertainty in availability.",

            "text": "The motivation of this study is based on influenza vaccine supply chain. Influenza is a very well-known acute respiratory illness that circulates quickly resulting in seasonal outbreaks. World Health Organization (WHO) reports that each year the outbreaks end up with 250,000\u2013500,000 deaths globally; additionally annual costs of outbreaks in terms of health care, lost days of work and schooling, and social disruption vary between $1 million and $6 million per 100,000 inhabitants in industrialized countries like France, Germany, and the United States (World Health Organization 2005). Annual vaccination is known to be the most effective and efficient strategy for fighting influenza to prevent morbidity and mortality. Therefore, majority of the countries carry out influenza vaccination programmes targeting nationwide coverage levels. In spite of the programmes having been implemented, current statistics show that the vaccine coverage lag behind the targeted goals in most of the developed countries (Mereckiene 2015; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2015a). Also, WHO reports that all countries in the world are facing influenza vaccine shortage. These problems originate from issues that are inherent to influenza vaccine supply chains.",

            "text": "One of the challenges of this system arises mainly due to characteristics of production process such as long production times, reformulation of vaccine composition each year, and yield issues. Majority of the production depends on flu virus grown in chicken eggs. The process starts with the announcement of the WHO Global Influenza Program on the virus strains that will be included in the forthcoming season\u2019s vaccines. The manufacturing procedure takes approximately six months and can be summarized as follows: growing the virus in chicken eggs, harvesting the virus containing fluid from the eggs after several days, inactivating viruses, purifying, testing, and packaging (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2015b; Gerdil 2003). Vaccine composition is controlled each year and updated if needed due to continuous antigenic changes in the virus strains. The uncertain characteristics of the biological processes and safety and quality tests cause yield uncertainty. Specifically, either the production may result in fewer quantities or it may need extra time to end up with the desired quantities (National Vaccine Advisory Committee 2003). Besides, there are always problems of timely distribution of the usable vaccine to different areas, all causing an uncertainty in the availability of vaccine in the desired quantities at each demand point. We are going to name this phenomena as \u201cuncertainty in availability\u201d, caused by production yield problems that includes late production instances, as well as delays in timely distribution of vaccine that prevents effective usage (Duijzer et al. 2018; Yarmand et al. 2014). Hence, instead of produced quantity, \u201cusable quantity\u201d is available for effective vaccination.",

In the strategy, we consider possibility of different efforts that will eventually increase the usable quantity. We enable this by considering a total budget, which can be used for different efforts, and solve a budget allocation problem. Formulating the problem as a budget allocation problem and solving it under a limited budget are motivated from the fact that budget is generally made up off funding from various sources (i.e. countries, organizations, and etc.) and thus the total is not fully controllable. Also, in their introduction to a special issue on health care, Brailsford et al. (2012) explicitly point out the importance of strategic decisions and budget usage in public-oriented health sector activities.",

Thus, we study the problem for a system consisting of a newsvendor firm that faces yield issues and a central authority having a fixed budget throughout the paper. For the influenza vaccine case, central authority refers to a social planner like WHO, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), etc. or a government. The role of the central authority is to coordinate the expenditures limited by the budget and maximize the social welfare. A critical issue while designing an intervention mechanism is to choose the intervention tools to be considered and their associated effects.",

In practice, these may correspond to subsidizing vaccine cost, public education, media campaigns to inform those at high risk, expanding access to vaccination services (i.e. via pharmacy, immunization centers near schools and worksites, home visits), organizing school vaccination programs, and establishing client reminder and recall systems (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2015a). A different example to demand increasing strategies can be given based on a recent news discussing low immunization rates for HPV (The New York Times 2015). Current policy issues and lack of MD endorsement (and recommendation) are found to be responsible for the shortfall in the usage of these vaccines. For this case mentioned in the news, organizing information briefing for doctors can be a good example for demand increasing strategies so that they will make timely recommendations to children for receiving the vaccine.",

            "text": "Another intervention tool is availability increasing strategy through which usable quantity of the production decision can be increased. The uncertainty associated with the availability of flu vaccines has two causes which are output quantity due to random yield and delivery timing (Dai et al. 2016). The former dimension of uncertainty is mainly due to current production technologies that have several limitations such as yield issues, production capacity, and ability to accelerate production in case of pandemic. These inefficiencies can be overcome through financial support to manufacturer to increase yield and thus availability. Deo and Corbett (2009) also highlight that it is required to subsidize research on production processes instead of only implementing immunization programs. This can be done by giving funding to manufacturer to share his risk or investing in new production technologies. For instance, U.S. government and the Crucell Corporation have been investing in cell based technology which promises to provide more flexibility and has the potential to reduce lead times and yield uncertainty (Williams 2016). The U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) granted $9.5 million to ID Biomedical to develop this technology. In 2016, FDA has approved cell isolated vaccine viruses and the only cell based flu vaccine has been licensed (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2019). The latter dimension of uncertainty in the availability includes timing inefficiencies in production and delivery timing (Duijzer et al. 2018). Several examples from US can be found. An early example can be given as 2000\u20132001 season during which influenza vaccine coverage has been realized 16% lower than the previous season while leaving 7.5 million doses unused (Dai et al. 2016). The reason behind has been explained by the unavailability of vaccines during peak demand times of October and November which results with the cancellation of vaccination campaigns. A more recent example is delayed shipments during 2014\u20132015 season leading to shortage during peak demand time. These examples bring out the idea of removing these issues by better planning and support to manufacturer to encourage him to initiate at risk early production prior to the design freeze.",

Bivariate lognormal distribution is quite general as one can represent distributions with different shapes and values of coefficient of variation. We express demand and availability as functions of corresponding investments made to improve them. Under the lognormal demand and availability models proposed, given central authority\u2019s decisions we obtain closed form expression for the optimal quantity to be produced by the manufacturer.

            "text": "Recent studies in operations management have examined the design of incentives in public-interest goods context. The incentives considered are generally in the form of rebates (i.e. refund of money awarded to consumers of that particular product) or subsidies (i.e. payment to the firm that manufactures and/or sells the product for every unit produced/ordered). There are a number of studies that consider a single intervention tool in order to motivate the adoption of this type of goods, which are Lobel and Perakis (2011), Cohen et al. (2015), and Chemama et al. (2014). Lobel and Perakis (2011) consider the use of rebates in order to reach a specified adoption target for solar photovoltaic technology. Cohen et al. (2015) investigate the impact of demand uncertainty on the optimal rebate amount as well as governmental expenditure, supplier\u2019s profit, and consumer surplus. Chemama et al. (2014) develop a two-period model to study the effect of committing to a rebate amount along two periods versus adjusting it among the periods on the risk sharing between government and supplier. On the other hand, there are studies on intervention design and its impacts on the societal and players\u2019 outcomes in a setting including multiple intervention tools. Raz and Ovchinnikov (2015) and Taylor and Xiao (2014) employ rebates and subsidies for coordinating the market. Raz and Ovchinnikov (2015) analyze the problem via three different mechanisms (i.e. joint mechanism consisting both tools and two simplified mechanisms including one of the tools) and show that joint mechanism can coordinate the system, whereas simplified mechanisms can coordinate either price or quantity. In contrast, Taylor and Xiao (2014) explores the problem for a long shelf life product like malaria drugs and show that the donor should only subsidize the firm at the optimal scheme. In Demirci and Erkip (2017), central authority uses a joint mechanism composed of investment in demand increasing strategies and rebates for regulating the system. They present a model that decides on the optimal budget amount and details of intervention mechanism. One possible example of public-interest good is home care service with a lot of inference to possible strategic and tactical level plans as described by Matta et al. (2014). They present a model for home care organisations from an operations management perspective. Additionally, as a solution methodology we use a similar approach employed by Demirci and Erkip (2017). However, the characteristic of this problem is quite different as this one includes an explicit budget consideration, as well as random yield in addition to random demand and different intervention tools.",

            "text": "At the same time, there is an increasing interest in vaccine supply chain related decision problems in OR/OM literature. Duijzer et al. (2018) presents a structured overview of vaccine supply chain literature by classifying the studies depending on the supply chain component under consideration, which are composition, allocation, distribution, and production. The studies on vaccine composition investigate the problem of which virus strains to include in the vaccine for either influenza or HIV vaccines. Examples for the ones focusing on influenza vaccines are Kornish and Keeney (2008), Cho (2010), and \u00d6zalt\u0131n et al. (2011), and examples for HIV are Porco and Blower (1998) and Maher and Murray (2016). Besides, there are also studies focusing on epidemic dynamics of influenza, which can be utilized for making preparatory planning. One recent example is Lee and Shin (2016). The vaccine allocation problem decides on for which groups vaccination will be administered. As the problem is a higher level decision problem and quite general, it has been studied for various types of diseases and cases. Some recent studies are Samii et al. (2012), Tanner and Ntaimo (2010) and Yarmand et al. (2014). Vaccine distribution problem includes several operational problems. One is determining how to distribute the vaccines, i.e. via fixed locations (or point of dispensing) or mobile facilities. Each option brings out new questions like facility location and layout and staffing decisions if point of dispensing is chosen and routing problems otherwise. The other operational problem is to decide on size and location of vaccine inventories. Examples of studies dealing with these problems are Jacobson et al. (2006), Halper and Raghavan (2011), and Ramirez-Nafarrate et al. (2015). The studies which are closely related to our work fall into the production category. This cluster of papers has been devoted to find schemes to coordinate the vaccine market. We will only review the ones which focus on influenza vaccines in the remaining part of this section.",

            "text": "The inefficiencies of a flu vaccine supply chain emanating from operational issues on the supply side and negative externality effect on the demand side mostly have not been addressed concurrently in prior studies. A group of studies focus on only supply uncertainty and its impact on social welfare. Chick et al. (2008) present first integrated supply chain/health economics model for a system consisting of a monopolistic manufacturer that sells vaccines to a government. Based on their results they investigate that manufacturer bears all of the production risks due to lack of coordination, which results in shortfall of vaccines. Hence, they derive a variant of cost sharing contract, which provides an incentive to the manufacturer to produce social optimum quantity. In Chick et al. (2016), the major concern is to design a contract that will align incentives of government and manufacturer as in Chick et al. (2008), but they consider an environment with asymmetric information about production uncertainty and include the possibility to fulfill the shortfall demand at a higher cost after the delivery date. Mamani et al. (2013) extend the study of Chick et al. (2008) to a scenario with multiple governments and risk of disease transmission across borders. They design a contractual agreement among governments that will enhance global health outcomes. Using a Cournot competition model, Deo and Corbett (2009) argue that the limited number of entrants in a vaccine market, vaccine undersupply and low society surplus can be explained by yield uncertainty inherent to this environment. In all of these studies demand is exogenous to their models; however the consumer behavior (reflecting negative network externality effect) is also incorporated in this context more recently. Briefly, they assume that consumers\u2019 decision of whether to uptake vaccine depends on the vaccinated fraction of the population. Mamani et al. (2012) show that in an oligopolistic vaccine market, a fixed subsidy should be administered to consumers so that a socially optimal immunization rate can be reached. However, they ignore the impact of yield uncertainty on the subsidy design and social welfare. Later, Adida et al. (2013) study a similar problem in a setting that includes consumer behavior as well as yield uncertainty, and show that a fixed two-part subsidy scheme is not sufficient to coordinate even the monopoly market. They propose a two-part menu of subsidies that includes a subsidy dependent on coverage level given to the consumers and a unit production payment to the manufacturer in order to eliminate the market inefficiencies. In contrast to previous studies, Arifo\u011flu et al. (2012) do not formalize the setting as an incentive design problem, but instead explore the implications of demand side versus supply side interventions on the manufacturer\u2019s decision and societal outcome under different conditions. In addition to yield uncertainty considered in the articles described below, Yarmand et al. (2014) shows that allocation problem and timing of distribution significantly affects the issue of availability as mentioned in the introduction.",

Any effort aimed at increasing demand will shift the demand distribution, and similarly investment made in availability increasing strategies will affect availability distribution. Thus, mean demand and mean availability increase as investment made in demand increasing and availability increasing strategies increase, respectively.

The reason behind this is that the main goal is to increase the adoption level in this environment. The adoption level is closely related with the quantity produced as the self-interested individuals decide whether to search for vaccine by knowing the available quantity (Arifo\u011flu et al. 2012; Arifo\u011flu 2012).

Note that we can also envision a correlation between the uncertain components of demand and availability variables. Positive correlation indicates that higher demand motivates the manufacturer to improve availability, as well as improved availability may result in a tendency for more demand. On the other hand, it is harder to justify negative correlation though. One possible explanation might be to consider a situation where knowledge of higher levels of availability dampening the artificial demand amplification caused by the previous unacceptable experiences.",

However, we see that the additional budget spent per person can be considerably high for some cases due to concave structure of demand and availability models. For the cases where the budget spent per additional person vaccinated is higher than $15, the policy maker may prefer to subsidize whole cost of vaccines instead of investing in demand and availability increasing strategies. Moreover, we can interpret whether the budget used in current practice is reasonable based on these results. If uncertainty in the system is high, the current budget used in practice seems to be reasonable and can be increased further; otherwise for low uncertainty case a much lower budget looks to be sufficient for investing in demand and availability increasing strategies.",

The goal of the intervention is to resolve the inefficiencies like insufficient demand and availability issues that are inherent to the system and motivate the channel to take socially more acceptable decisions. We develop and incorporate lognormal demand and availability models to our decision problem, general enough to be used in different contexts as well. For the detailed analysis of the model, we follow a pessimistic view and use demand and availability functions with equal coefficient of variation values. Of course, the value of the mechanism will be more if the variances are also affected from the investments made.",

Along with the numerical study, we show that the vaccination coverage in US can be increased considerably via the proposed joint mechanism by addressing both demand and availability issues in the system. Note that in addition to enhancing social welfare, proposed mechanism decreases total budget requirements for a desired level of vaccination. Note that the budget used for improving the vaccination percentages and availability are generally separate as they are funded by different organizations or resources. The budget we used in the numerical study is mainly to support and extend the reach of influenza vaccines.
