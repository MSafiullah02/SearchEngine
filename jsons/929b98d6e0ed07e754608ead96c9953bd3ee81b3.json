While consent can be assumed in a true emergency, many non-emergent situations still require decisions earlier than the weeks-to-months it would take to appoint a guardian. A recent legal review by Thaddeus Pope highlights the confusing patchwork of laws that various states have passed in order to address this issue (2017) . A number of states have taken preventative measures, such as expanding the list of legally acceptable surrogates to include more distant relatives, or friends. A few have authorized the physician to make certain decisions, often after seeking a second medical opinion. Others have authorized physicians to make decisions after consulting an ethics committee. Many limit the decisions or prescribe a \"tiered\" approach. Currently, there is no consistency in the law, and many states (such as ours) have yet to address the issue at all.",

Briefly, when the medical team identifies a PWP who will require imminent, but non-emergent medical decisions, they are advised to contact the ethics consultation service. The consultant first works with the medical team and social worker to conduct an aggressive search for a surrogate, or, failing that, to find someone who knows the patient and can provide information as to what treatment the patient might have wanted. By using creative search techniques, the consultants are often successful in finding a surrogate or another source of information such as a friend, clergy, or previous health care provider. Occasionally surrogates are incapacitated themselves, or refuse to take on the role of decision-maker. Our state law prevents many of these people (friends, neighbors, etc.) from serving as surrogates, but they are often available and willing to contribute by telling us what they know of the patient's life and values.",

However, after 10 days, she still could not be weaned from the ventilator, and had shown no signs of cognitive recovery. The PWP committee met again and recommended against tracheostomy and PEG placement, instead opting for comfort care. They based this decision on the belief that an active, independent woman like Ms. M would most likely not want an extended life of disability in a nursing facility. The attending physician agreed.

She refused the surgery, saying she would \"wear the boot and use the crutches this time.\" However, the medical team believed that she lacked capacity to make this decision, and called ethics. Ms. F had long ago alienated her family, so none could be located.

The PWP committee met Ms. F and tried to understand her reasons for refusing surgery, but she could not articulate any.

Volunteers receive HIPAA training, authorization to have access to patients' private health information, and protection from liability.

It is also important that committee members are available at short notice. Decisions are usually needed urgently, so members are asked to meet with the medical team within 24-48 h after receiving the consult. It has been helpful to have committee members who live or work close to the hospital and are retired or have flexible schedules. Over the years since the inception of the protocol, committee orientation and education have become somewhat more formalized. Three of the original members did not recall any formal training beyond participating in the larger ethics committee. More recent recruits were asked to meet with the ethics consultants, read and discuss an article about the PWP protocol, and sit in on PWP consults as an observer. This combination of clinical experience, serving on the ethics committee, and observing PWP cases seems to be adequate, as they are not expected to provide expert ethical opinions.

Further research demonstrated that family predictions about the patient's treatment preferences more closely match their own (Fagerlin et al. 2001) .

Interviewees expressed a variety of opinions about this, weighing the benefits of gaining additional information and humanizing the patient against the risk of introducing bias into the decision-making process. Ultimately, most committee members felt that seeing the patient was at the very least permissible and in some cases obligatory. We agree that seeing critically ill patients may elicit a strong emotional response from committee members, and that medical professionals are much less likely to react in such a way. It is the role of the medical team to provide context for what the committee members are seeing. Their differing perspectives complement one another; the clinicians bring their own biases that laypersons do not, and vice versa.

Depending on how much background information the ethicist and social worker can discover, it is sometimes possible to make a reasonable guess as to what the patient would have wanted. Perhaps a neighbor says the patient was fiercely independent and valued physical activity above all other aspects of life; or staff at the patient's nursing home describe a patient's recognition of poor quality of life and expressed wishes to stop treatment. In these cases, there is at least some indication that a patient's wish might be to set limits on treatments, or forego them entirely. Alternatively, knowing that a patient had a positive outlook and adjusted well to life in a nursing facility does not tell us exactly what a patient would want, but suggests the patient's tolerance for extended rehabilitation or permanent residence in a facility. Piecing together these bits of biographical information does not suggest that substituted judgment in the classic sense is being exercised.

Committee members have higher levels of health literacy and clinical experience in decision-making than most patients or surrogates, which we believe enable them to ask more probing questions and even disagree with the medical team at times. One can imagine that traditional surrogates might lack the knowledge or confidence to challenge medical professionals. However, the lack of racial diversity is a significant weakness.

With limited knowledge of patients and their wishes regarding treatments, decision-making based on substituted judgment is not possible. However, we feel that the protocol facilitates decision-making that is ethically more desirable than \"best interest\" based on what a \"reasonable person\" would want given the risks, benefits, and likelihood of success. Because we have been able to gather important information about the patient's lifestyle and quality of life in almost all cases, we believe that we are utilizing a hybrid standard, which we have termed \"informed best interest\". We believe that \"informed best interest\" is best determined by rigorous dialogue between the medical team and committee members. Committee members do not perceive they are simply \"rubber-stamping\" the doctor's decision; rather, they have thorough discussions commensurate with the gravity of the decision at hand. The process is made transparent by recording all attempts to locate surrogates and information gathered about each patient, as well as the deliberations and decisions made for them. Finally, fairness is served by adherence to the same protocol for every PWP case.",

Our protocol ensures that every attempt is made to respect the autonomy of these patients by mandating a thorough search for suitable surrogates and other evidence of the patient's wishes. It minimizes medical and institutional bias by including community members in the decision-making process. By identifying these patients, aggressively searching for family and background information, reaching a consensus on the most ethical treatment plan, and tracking outcomes, we have established a level of transparency and oversight that was previously lacking.",

Providing treatment recommendations that can be life altering, and in some cases, life ending, can generate feelings of discomfort and moral ambiguity. Several interviewees admitted to occasionally dwelling on past cases and wondering whether they made the right decision. A more formalized review and debriefing process could be initiated, which would be helpful for quality control and training, as well as a source of closure for the committee members. At this time, PWP cases are reviewed on a regular basis by the full ethics committee. The purpose is to ensure rigor and consistency in the decision-making process, as well as to inform committee members about the outcomes of their cases. However, it would be beneficial to also debrief committee members periodically, one-on-one, to provide an opportunity to discuss any concerns they may not be comfortable sharing with the full committee. Talking through challenging cases with others may lessen any negative feelings and protect against burnout. While these negative feelings are an important concern, the committee members also take great satisfaction in helping these patients. It is worth noting that no PWP committee members have dropped out or avoided meetings due to burnout.",

At the very least, our protocol identifies these patients and provides transparency and accountability in decision-making. We have a committee of community members who are empathic and knowledgeable in clinical and ethical decision-making, doing their best to represent patients who otherwise have no one to speak for them. Their background and experience give them the confidence to question the medical team thoroughly, understand the options, and make a reasoned judgment based on \"informed best interest\". No protocol for PWP decision-making will avoid the moral discomfort and uncertainty involved in making decisions for this patient population, nor should that be the goal. Rather, PWP protocols should focus on improving on the status quo by implementing thorough procedures for finding background information about the patient, promoting transparency, and minimizing conflict of interest.",
