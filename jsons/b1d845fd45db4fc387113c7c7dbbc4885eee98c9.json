It is indispensable to have robust and reliable ways of evaluating the effectiveness of these measures. In this work, we assume that, at a very coarse-grained level of description, the overall effect of all the mitigation measures is that we can still describe the spread of the pandemic using the most basic Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removed (SEIR) model but with an \"effective contact rate\" (\u03b2) which is time-dependent. We then use the time series data of the number of infected individuals in the population to extract the instantaneous effective contact rate which is the result of various social interventions put in place. This approach has the potential to be significantly useful while evaluating the impact of mitigation measures on the spread of COVID-19 in near future.",

The speed with which an epidemic spreads is dependent on a large number of factors. E.g., an infectious disease has certain intrinsic parameters such as mean serial interval, mean incubation period, mean infectious period etc. In addition, the spread of the disease also depends on the ease with which newer susceptible individuals can get infected: this plays a pivotal role in determining parameters such as the basic reproduction number of the epidemic in a population. The mitigation measures essentially try to ensure that the number of contacts between infectious and susceptible individuals as well as the probability of infection on contact are as small as possible. Modelling the spread of an epidemic while the various mitigation measures are being practised is thus a complex task.",

The present work deals with an approach which could prove to be useful when we wish to have a coarse grained description which still takes into account all the different effects (such as migrations, contact tracing, quarantines, lockdowns, heterogeneous mixing of population, testing of some fraction of asymptomatic cases etc) which go on almost simultaneously when an epidemic spreads. We surmise that, as these myriad complex processes take place, at a very broad, coarse grained level of description, the dynamics of a pandemic such as COVID-19, which is known to have some latency period, is still going to be described by the well known Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removed, SEIR model [18, 19] with an effective contact rate \u03b2 which will be time-dependent. We shall present a step-by-step procedure by which this time dependent effective contact rate \u03b2(t) can be reliably reconstructed from the time series data of infectious fraction of the population. We must emphasise that this effective instantaneous contact rate \u03b2(t) is found while all the complicated mitigation measures and social distancing measures are being practised and put in place. Thus, for a given population such as a given city, we shall know the mitigation measures taken, and we can use the procedure described in this work to determine the effective instantaneous contact rate (or one of its smoothed incarnations).",

The Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removed, SEIR, class of models are some of the simplest and most studied ones. As an epidemic spreads, at any time t, let I(t) be the number of infected individuals and S(t) be the number of susceptible individuals in the population. Furthermore, let R(t) be the number of individuals removed from the epidemic dynamics (i.e. the number of those who have either died till time t or who have recovered till this time). We assume that those individuals who have recovered from the disease can not become susceptible again. Since the functions I(t), S(t) and R(t) give the number of individuals, their codomain must be the set of non-negative integers and hence, strictly speaking, these functions can not be continuous. Moreover, the true dynamics of the number of individuals during the spread of an epidemic is stochastic in nature. We shall mostly deal with the fractions s = S/N , i = I/N , r = R/N , where N is total population (which we assume changes only negligibly during the course of the spread of the epidemic). These quantities also change by discrete amounts but if the minimal possible change is sufficiently small, we can think of s(t), i(t) and r(t) as differentiable functions.",

For initial condition for i(t), we use the observed value of i(t i ) obtained using Eq (7) . On the other hand, for the fraction of population which is removed, we set r(t i ) = r 1 , while for the fraction of population exposed, we use the value of e(t i ) obtained by our reconstruction procedure. Next we need to use the reconstructed \u03b2 in SEIR evolution equations. In order to do so, we can either work with raw \u03b2, or, we can work with one of the smoothed forms of \u03b2 found in the last section. In fig (4) , we show i(t) found out after using the \"step-down\" form of \u03b2(t) (defined in Eq (14)) as well as the i(t) obtained from observations. From the fact that the two curves are so close, we learn that instead of working with raw \u03b2, we could also work with the \"step-down\" form of \u03b2 in order to find the long term evolution of the infected population. Similarly, in modelling the effects of various mitigation measures, other smoothed out forms of \u03b2 (such as the moving average or the polynomial fit) are almost as good as raw \u03b2 itself.",

These measures include personal preventive measures (such as the use of face masks, self quarantine etc), social distancing measures (such as closing down of schools and cancellation of social gatherings etc), travel restrictions, curfews and so on. When these drastic measures are practised on a large scale, they often lead to severe socioeconomic disruptions. Given this, it is extremely important that we should be able to compare the economic costs of disruptions to the extent to which the spread of a pandemic can be arrested by these measures. This is a task which can potentially be handled by sufficiently well predictive mathematical models of the spread of pandemics. Needless to say, any reliable forecasting for a system as complex as a city or a country is a colossally difficult task. Often, one has to build a virtual copy of the entire population of interest in one's simulation, taking into account such diverse effects as migrations, number of contacts per day, the effect of testing, contact tracing etc. Despite this, the predictions of the model depend on the values of a large number of parameters whose values can only be roughly estimated at best. Moreover, all of this modelling needs to be done while unprecedented mitigation measures are taking place. This just leads to the fact that, typically, models which try to take into account a very detailed description of the spread of the pandemic still prove to be inadequate.",

Then, in section \u00a7III, we began by elaborating on the procedure for obtaining a raw form of \u03b2 by reconstructing from the time series data by making use of SEIR evolution equations. It turns out that this raw form of \u03b2 can occasionally take unphysical negative values. We have explained what causes this to happen. Furthermore, the reconstruction procedure depends on the values of other parameters such as recovery rate (denote by \u03b3) and incubation rate (denoted by \u03c3) whose experimentally known values have experimental uncertainties.

We then illustrated how smoothed \u03b2 could be used to evolve SEIR equations. This can be used to find the evolution of the number of infected individuals if the mitigation measures are known beforehand. Finally, we provided the raw \u03b2 for six countries to demonstrate the method.
