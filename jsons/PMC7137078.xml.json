As of June 26, 2013, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) had caused 77 laboratory-confirmed cases and 40 deaths.1 The virus is related to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) that emerged in 2002\u201303. And, as SARS-CoV had during its prepandemic stage, MERS-CoV has probably been transmitted from an unknown animal host to human beings repeatedly in the past year.2, 3 Cases of human-to-human transmission have also been documented in several countries.1 This raises an important question: does MERS-CoV have the potential to cause a pandemic?",

The number of secondary infections caused by an index case can be highly variable.8, 9, 10 Sometimes, an individual with a highly infectious disease will only cause a few infections. Conversely, individuals with a disease of normally low infectiousness can occasionally cause many infections. This effect is compounded by the small number of confirmed cases during the prepandemic stage, and the difficulty of identifying whether the earliest patients were infected by other human beings or by animals. Additionally, if R0 is not much larger than 1 (ie, between 1 and about 1\u00b75), there is a fair chance that transmission will fade out anyway. Hence we cannot conclude that R0 is less than 1 just because secondary transmission seems to be low, as is the case for MERS-CoV so far. Using intuition to estimate whether R0 is greater than or less than 1 might not be accurate during the prepandemic stage, necessitating investigation using statistical methods.",

Other factors are more difficult to account for because the investigators would have to know how the situation might change in the future. For example, very recent reports document six asymptomatic infections.1 Additionally, R0 might change seasonally according to climate, school calendars, or yearly gatherings such as pilgrimages that put individuals in closer proximity to one another.12 If such gatherings involve greater contact between humans and infected animals, they would also create an opportunity for more disease introductions from animal populations.",

In the case of SARS-CoV, several mutations enabled the spike glycoprotein of the virus to bind with the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 human receptor, making it much easier for the virus to infect humans and thus probably increasing the R0 of the virus.13 Evolution presents a particularly relevant challenge for estimating R0 from a series of outbreaks distributed through time. The approach used by Breban and colleagues4 implicitly assumes that R0 does not change. Hence, a trend towards increasing cluster sizes would be interpreted by their method as natural variability unrelated to virus adaptation. If cluster sizes were actually growing because the virus was evolving a higher R0, the method would underestimate the actual, more evolved R0. Therefore, the significance of a large, new cluster might be misinterpreted. A method that allows for the estimated R0 to rise or fall over time might capture movement toward the R0=1 threshold caused by viral adaptation or seasonality, although the amount of data available for MERS-CoV probably does not permit this at present.",
