            "text": "It was the eminent mathematician Daniel Bernoulli (1766) from Basel who had the idea of describing the development of an epidemic using a differential equation, in particular with the aim of showing how the epidemic could be mitigated by vaccination. Bernoulli calculated the risk of dying from the vaccination against pox in his day as 1 to 200 and set it in relation to the expected prolongation of life of 3 years and 2 months. To Bernoulli's surprise, people resisted vaccination; they preferred the probability of dying earlier to the risk, though low, of dying immediately. Clearly, Bernoulli was not as brilliant as a psychologist as he was as a mathematician: he could not understand that people have no idea of probability, a concept too abstract for a non-scientist.",

The spread of the Black Death in Europe right up to the far north was the typical progress of a diffusion front as described by Fisher when talking about the spread of an advantageous gene, that is, a gene with higher advantage (Chap. 4). Noble was the first to describe this spread of an epidemic using equations (Noble 1974) .

Therefore, the spread of the Black Death is in fact a classical diffusion process that can be described with equations. It is one step more complicated than the spread of a growing population, as found, for example, in the case of the oak tree, since the spread of the epidemic implies 'finding' and increasing the number of infected people until the point at which these have either died or been healed.",

Fisher's growth term is now the increase in the percentage of infected people. This means that the interesting factor \u03b1 is not growth by reproduction as for the oak trees or Neolithic farmers (see Chaps. 4 and 5), but rather the rate of infection of still healthy but susceptible people (that is, people not immune from the start). The number of infected people cannot increase to infinity, however, since the number of people is limited, and not every one of them is susceptible. Hence, after a certain amount of time, every susceptible person has been infected, and the epidemic has reached its climax. Afterwards, the plague declines because all susceptible people have either died or else have been healed and are now immune. Noble put forward a reaction-diffusion equation for the infected population similar to that proposed by Fisher about 20 years earlier for the spread of an advantageous gene. Noble replaced Fisher's growth rate \u03b1 of the advantageous gene with the growth rate \u03b1 of the infected population (which he described as the product of the susceptible population and the rate of infection). In addition, Noble had to consider that a proportion of the infected persons would die and that others would recover. Therefore, the epidemic would die out after some time.",

For simplicity's sake, one-dimensional spread is assumed. It is evident that the number of infected people at the place of outbreak first increases (here from 500 infected per 1,000 km 2 to 2,000 after live on rats and other rodents; it is sometimes also transferred directly from person to person. The infected persons, if susceptible, fall ill and either die or become immune after having survived the illness. The Black Death has then 'consumed' the region and loses its strength. To make an estimation of the area in which a sick person can infect others, Noble assumed that people move on the average with a speed of 1-2 km per hour and that fleas jump over a distance of 2 m to their next victim, with a chance of infection of 10%. Noble attained a 'cross section' of an infected person for infecting others of about 1 km 2 per year.

Now comes one of those drastic simplifications characteristic of and necessary for calculations of historic events because, as emphasized earlier, in the humanities, unlike in the exact sciences, we cannot modify the real parameters, since they were fixed in the past. Noble assumed that people were equally distributed over Europe, thus arriving at an average population density of 20 people per square kilometre. And Noble assumed further, based on historical reports, that rumours and gossip spread in Europe with a speed of 100 miles per year in the manner of a random walk and that the Black Death spread at the same speed, since it also relied on personal contact. With Einstein's formula for movements on the surface of the earth (Chap. 3) Noble received a value for the diffusivity.

Descriptions of spread problems in the past, on the other hand, can be dealt in this way, since only a few parameters of these processes are known.

            "text": "As argued by Chapman et al. (2016) (see Chap. 4) for invasive plants (neophytes), repeated introduction to multiple areas and by multiple trade pathways is a feature of many invasions and leads to dispersal from newly emerging nuclei. Brockmann (2018) considers the same mechanism for the propagation of infectious diseases. Through air transport of people, the spread of epidemics over long distances appears even more probable than the spread of invasive plants, which in principle could be drastically mitigated. The possibility of transmitting diseases to distant locations can yield new seeds far away that can eventually become the nuclei of new waves of propagation. This implies that the distance from an initial outbreak location can no longer be used as a measure for estimating or computing the time that it takes for an epidemic to arrive at a certain location. From Fig. 7 .4, it can be seen that the dispersion of SARS, the severe acute respiratory syndrome, an epidemic caused by a virus, did not progress by means of a geographical wave. It sprang up in China and infected victims in the USA and in Europe earlier than in geographically much closer countries such as Korea or India. To treat traffic and consequently infections In this model, a once infested cell will never recover. Transmission occurs not only to nearest-neighbour sites but also to farther sites, though with a lower probability controlled by a distribution similar to a Gaussian (Richter et al. 2013a , Richter 2015 , see also Chap. 4). Bottom row: model of the spread of a disease. An infected site (red) can transmit an infection to a susceptible (white) neighbouring site. Left, earlier point in time, right, later time. Please note that in this model, infected sites recover and become immune (grey). Also here, in addition to nearest-neighbour transmission, with a small probability, a transmission to a distant site can occur (Brockmann 2018) spreading across many locations worldwide, a new idea is needed: Brockmann (2018) replaces the diffusion fluxes by the probabilities that susceptible, infected and recovered persons move from one location to another one and back.",

If two locations in the air-transportation network exchange a large number of passengers, they should be effectively close because Note that the epidemic arrived earlier in USA and Europe than in Korea or India. (Brockmann 2018) a larger number of passengers imply that the probability of an infectious disease being transmitted between them is comparatively higher than if these two locations were linked only by a small number of travelling passengers. This leads the authors to define the shortest path between each pair of airports. Figure 7 .5 depicts the shortest path tree Fig. 7 .5 Shortest path trees and effective distance from the perspective of Tegel airport (TXL) in Berlin. TXL is the central node. Radial distance in the tree quantifies the effective distance to the reference node TXL. Large European airports such as Frankfurt (FRA), Munich (MUC) and London Heathrow (LHR) are effectively close to TXL. However, some airports that are geographically distant, such as Chicago (ORD) and Beijing (PEK), are actually effectively closer than smaller European airports. (Brockmann 2018) for the Berlin airport Tegel, TXL. You can see that large European airports are effectively close to TXL, as you might expect. However, large Asian and American airports such as Beijing (PEK) and New York (JFK) are also comparatively close to TXL. Because the shortest path tree also represents the most probable routes for spreading, this method can be used to identify airports that are particularly important in terms of distributing an infectious disease throughout the network. Figure 7 .6 employs the effective distance and shortest path tree representation from the perspective of the outbreak location of an epidemic. Similar to a reaction obeying simple reaction-diffusion dynamics, which spreads as a wave of advance with constant speed over distance, infection processes spread at a constant speed over effective distance (Brockmann 2018) . One can predict the arrival time of an epidemic wave front, knowing the speed of the effective wave of advance and the effective distance. For example, if the spreading commences shortly after an epidemic outbreak and the initial spreading speed is determined, arrival times can be forecast. Fig. 7.6 Temporal snapshots of computer-simulated hypothetical scenarios corresponding to an epidemic initially starting at LHR (London). The networks depict the shortest effective distance to the corresponding seed airports. (Brockmann 2018) ",

The girl died because the doctors could not imagine that her disease was malaria and so did not give her the correct treatment. Transport over large distance is a modern phenomenon, whereas in medieval times-with the exception of the crusades or long journeys by merchants such as Marco Polo-people moved by random walk in a very limited area. Globalization has completely revolutionized the spread dynamics of diseases: whereas 700 years ago it took a ship arriving from the Levant to import the Black Death, which then needed several years to spread over Europe, today the outbreak of a global disease may be a matter of days. On the other hand, the mitigation of the Black Death was impossible, the numerous 'plague walls' all over Europe proving useless, whereas computer simulations such as those of Brockmann may be expected to lead towards models that might accurately predict contagion patterns and thus prevent the invasion.",
