Hence, identification of SES zones in thirty-eight sub-basins (SB) for basin prioritization is necessary. The present research addressed the issue by using four multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) models: VlseKriterijumska optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje (VIKOR), technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS), simple additive weighing (SAW), compound factor (CF). To determine the best fitted method from MCDM for erosion susceptibility (ES), a comparison has been made with Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), where fifteen morphometric parameters were considered for MCDM, and meteorological data, soil, slope and land use land cover (LULC) were considered for SWAT model. Two validation indices of percentage change and intensity change were used for evaluation and comparison of MCDM results. With SWAT model performance, SWAT calibration and uncertainty analysis programs (CUP) was used for sensitive analysis of SWAT parameters on flow discharge and sediment load simulation. The results showed that 23, 16, 18 SB have high ES; therefore they were given 1 to 3 ranks, whereas 31, 37, 21SB have low ES, hence given 38 to 36 rank as predicted by MCDM methods and SWAT. MCDM validation results depict that VIKOR and CF methods are more acceptable than TOPSIS and SAW. Calibration (flow discharge R 2 0.86, NSE 0.75; sediment load R 2 0.87, NSE 0.69) and validation (flow discharge R 2 0.79, NSE 0.55; sediment load R 2 0.79, NSE 0.76) of SWAT model indicated that simulated results",

Second step comprises of boundary demarcation for extraction of stream number and its contributing area of specific outlets, flow direction, and flow accumulation in each DEM pixel, using ArcSWAT tools. In order to attain high accuracy value, SRTM DEM was used for comparison and clarification of sub-basin boundary with topographical maps, and extracted three dominant morphometric aspects i.e. basin shape, linear and landscape. Table 1 presents the measuring techniques of nineteen major morphometric parameters following such literature. After extracting morphometric parameters, four MCDM methods of TOPSIS, VIKOR, SAW, and CF were applied to predict the sub-basins priority for estimating ES in Kangsabati basin at sub-basin level, retrieved from their validated results of percentage change and intensity change. In contrary, SWAT model was applied to estimate the flow discharge and sediment load, as well sediment yield for the assignment of actual sub-basin priority rank, and then make a comparison between effective MCDM methods and SWAT model.",

Huge sediment load helps to accumulation of sediment yield at sub-basin level where SWAT model is applied to estimate the amount of yield following some considerable hydrological parameters (Welde, 2016 Figure 7 showed that most of the basin area come under low to medium sediment yield priority class, whereas high and very high sediment yield classes are mainly concentrated at outlets or confluence points. Generally, absences of flow discharge, low drainage density and lower catchment area helps to generate low sediment yield, while presence of confluence points, high drainage density and large catchment area helps to accumulate of high sediment yield (Bhattacharya et al., 2020a) . In terms of ES at sub-basin level, monthly sediment yield priority is classified into four classes i.e. According to assigned rank of simulated sediment yield, very high erosion priority class mainly concentrated in SB 13, 16, 18, 19, 23 , while high erosion priority class concentrated in SB 2, 6, 14, 17, 20, 22, 25, 26, 28 and 31, respectively (Fig. 8 ).

Therefore, it is pointed that amount of sediment yield are fully dependent with ES level throughout the basin. classes throughout the basin. These susceptible classes are major sediment source sites where huge sediment load supply helps to vast accumulation of sediment yield.

In spite of dense vegetation cover and pasture land, SB 13, 16, 18, 23 are more susceptible to erosion due to maximum values of linear morphometric parameters (mean bifurcation ratio, drainage density, drainage texture, stream frequency) and relief morphometric parameters (slope, ruggedness index, relief ratio, basin relief) as well as minimum values of basin form parameters (form factor, shape factor, compact coefficient and circular ratio) (Fig.9 ). In contrast, despite the presence of barren land, double crop practice and dense settlement, of 0.8073 m ton/ha. Thus, based on the above discussion, it can be said that among all the available MCDM methods for ES, VIKOR model is more pragmatic for ES in respect to simulated sediment yield rank as predicted by SWAT. In order to ES and sediment yield deposition at sub-basin level, in this study demonstrated that VIKOR is fittest MCDM model for suitable selection of best and worst values from morphometric parameters using normalize decision matrix of AHP, maximum group utility index, minimum regret index of opposite group value, as well as assessment of compatibility and incompatibility decision among effective morphometric parameters. Therefore, VIKOR model is useful MCDM method to prepare rational sub-basin prioritization from linear normalize ranking of all morphometric parameters. Moreover, VIKOR method helps to identify the five critical sub-basins that are most sensible to erosion due to presence of responsible morphometric parameters in line with the results of Bhattacharya et al. (2020a) . On the other hand, SWAT parameters helps to determine the significant role of morphometric parameters on ES in response to sediment yield deposition throughout the basin. Therefore, it can be stated that morphometric parameters are considered as crucial contributing parameters for ES generation in this plateau fringe basin, followed by LULC patterns, climate, and soil characteristic. These agreements are validated with the findings of Biswas et al. (1999) , Hembram and Saha (2018) , Sridhar et al. (2018) . Based on literature review in introduction, previous researchers have presented sub-basin prioritization in order to ES using MCDM methods; however, there is no hydrological model to measure the significant role of hydrological parameters like runoff volume, sediment load, sediment concentration, etc. on sub-basin prioritization. In this context, there is research gap in previous studies of sub-basin prioritization. Present study tried to address this research gap using a comparison between MCDM and SWAT models. In term of ES, present study humbly argues that effective morphometric and hydrological parameters are prerequisite for sub-basin prioritization in any region in the world as assigned by VIKOR and SWAT models. Moreover, both models reveal that all morphometric and hydrological parameters are not equally significant in every sub-basin as they have own characteristics.",
