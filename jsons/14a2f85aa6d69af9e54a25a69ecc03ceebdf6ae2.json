Intuitively, one may hypothesize that those synonymous mutations which increase the tAI values are favored by natural selection. Results: We use the maize (Zea mays) genome to test our assumption. The first supporting evidence is that the tAIincreasing synonymous mutations have higher fixed-to-polymorphic ratios than the tAI-decreasing ones. Next, the DAF (derived allele frequency) or MAF (minor allele frequency) of the former is significantly higher than the latter. Moreover, similar results are obtained when we investigate CAI (codon adaptation index) instead of tAI.",

Codons with higher tRNA concentrations tend to have higher translation rates. These codons are regarded as optimized codons or optimal codons [7, 8] . It is intuitive to consider that the change in tAI caused by synonymous mutations should undergo selection force. This selection is certainly independent of amino acid sequences because they do not alter the amino acids. Although this notion is verified in a limited number of animal species, the genome-wide situation (selection patterns on synonymous mutations) in plant kingdom remains largely unknown.

A study in the ancient gymnosperm species Gingko biloba found higher frequency for A/T ending codons than G/ C ending codons, but meanwhile it found that the highly expressed genes and those genes involved in environmental adaptation tend to use C/G ending codons, suggesting that the Gingko genome is dominated by natural selection [9] . Similarly, in angiosperms, it was found that the G/C ending codons were optimal (e.g. in Arabidopsis thaliana) and that there was enrichment of these G/C ending codons in monocots compared to dicots [10] . Another study in four non-grass monocot species also proposed that the G/C ending codons are optimal and that this preference is not likely caused by mutation biases [11] . Nevertheless, a recent study on four cotton species found the pattern that the pyrimidine-enriched codons (especially those ending with T) have higher frequency in the CDSs [12] . Meanwhile, it was also declared that the GC3 (GC content at the 3rd codon position) method was not always suitable for evolutionary comparisons at different scales [13] although CAI is positively correlated with GC3 [11] . From another aspect, the strength of codon bias could be largely different in different species. Previous studies comparing rice and Arabidopsis discovered that codon bias is stronger in housekeeping genes [14] , and that the preference for increasing CDS GC content is stronger in rice [15] .",

Usually, the nonsynonymous to synonymous ratios are measurements for the adaptiveness of different sets of nonsynonymous mutations [20, 21] . Accordingly, we observed that the fixed to polymorphic ratios of nonsynonymous or nonsense mutations are significantly lower than that of synonymous mutations (Fig. 2) . We wonder whether we could see differences in fixed to polymorphic ratios between the two categories of synonymous mutations.",

We show our data that the median distance between the nearby tAIup and tAI-down mutations is less than 90 bp (Additional file 1: Figure S7 ). However, for recombination hotspots, the \"unit\" for recombination should be \"Kb\" or longer. If recombination bias does play a role, it should equally affect the tAI-up and tAI-down mutations, which means that the tAI-up mutations near the hotspots should have higher allele frequencies than the tAI-up mutations far from recombination hotspots. In other words, under recombination bias, the high frequency mutations should be clustered and the low frequency mutations should be clustered, respectively. Take a \"tAIup\" mutation for instance, if its nearest mutation is also a \"tAI-up\" mutation, we name it \"up near up\". If its nearest mutation is a \"tAI-down\" mutation, we name it \"up near down\". Similarly, we define \"down near up\" and \"down near down\" mutations. We find no difference between the DAF/MAF of \"up near up\" versus \"up near down\" groups, or \"down near up\" versus \"down near down\" groups (Additional file 1: Figure S8 ).

Both X1 (CAI change) and X2 (tAI change) are positively correlated with Y. Next, we provide the regression coefficients of X1, X2 and X3 against Y (Fig. 6b) . The result supports a major role of CAI and tAI, and a minor role of GC percentage. The selection on CAI or tAI is truly playing a role in shaping the allele frequency spectrum.",

The observed GC3 is the relic of natural selection and it does not directly tell the functional relevance. We associated the pure genomic features with the potential function. Since 23 out of 32 high tAI codons are G/C-ending and 21 out of 29 codons are A/T-ending, our study has found a putative reason (higher translation rate) for the positive selection for optimal codons. Meanwhile, GC-biased gene conversion would mimic the pattern under natural selection for transnational efficiency, which means that gene conversion could lead to an overestimation of the optimality of C/G-to-A/T mutations [28] . Since the optimal codons in maize is biased toward C/G-ending ones, one cannot rule out the higher frequency of preferred codons is due to GC-biased gene conversion. For example, two derived mutation sites, T-to-C at site1 and G-to-A at site2, mean that in the population there are T and C alleles at site1, and G and A alleles at site2. If DAF site1 > DAF site2 , then we would claim that T-to-C should be more favorable than G-to-A mutation according to our theory. However, this might also be caused by the biased gene conversion towards C allele at site1 and towards G allele at site2. We find a way to exclude this bias if we test our pattern among the A/T-ending codons alone or among the C/G-ending codons alone. We retrieved all A-to-T or T-to-A mutations, the tAI-up mutations have a median DAF of 0.388 and those tAI-down mutations have a median DAF of 0.301 (p-value = 2.9e-4, Wilcoxon rank sum test). Among all C-to-G or G-to-C mutations, the tAI-up mutations have a median DAF of 0.407 and those tAI-down mutations have a median DAF of 0.303 (pvalue = 6.3e-8, Wilcoxon rank sum test). The A-T switches and C-G switches ensure that the comparison between the bi-allelic site is fair and not affect by the biased gene conversion. So that our conclusion is robust.",

Then OrthoMCL employs all-against-all blastp algorithm to identify orthologs between species and paralogs within species. It provides us the best-two-way hits, that is the reciprocal best similarity pairs. We only focus on the orthologous genes between species. For each ortholog group, we require it to contain three single gene of three species. For example, let M = maize gene, C = carrot gene and W = wheat gene, then group (M1, C1, W1) is wanted rather than group (M1, C1) or group (M1, M2, C1, W1). Now that we have orthologous gene group (M1, C1, W1) resulted from OrthoMCL, we could use multiple alignment to align the CDS sequences of gene M1, C1 and W1. We use ClustalW [32] with parameters type = nucleotide and matrix = pam. With the CDS alignments, for each nucleotide in maize CDS, we could easily know the nucleotides at the orthologous site in wheat and carrot.

For polymorphic mutations (called from the deep sequenced RNA-seq data) and fixed mutations (obtained from the CDS alignment) in maize, the ancestral state is inferred from the orthologous nucleotide in wheat and carrot. Only the sites with identical bases between wheat and carrot are used. Take the case (of polymorphic mutations) shown in the graph as an example, the orthologous sites in two outgroups are C, and the reference genome of maize is also C, while in the RNA-seq data, both C and another nucleotide are detected. Furthermore, any potential polymorphic sites in wheat or carrot (that are detectable in RNA-seq in wheat or carrot) are discarded. Figure S2 . Locations of the CDS sequence files and RNA-seq data of the plant species used in this study and the basic statistics of the maize genome. Figure S3 . Fixed to polymorphic ratios of different mutation categories. Highly expressed and lowly expressed genes are classified. These mutation categories include nonsynonymous and nonsense mutations as well as the synonymous mutations that increase or decrease the tAI. Figure S4 . DAF and MAF spectrum of polymorphic mutations of different mutation categories. Highly expressed and lowly expressed genes are classified. These mutation categories include nonsynonymous and nonsense mutations as well as the synonymous mutations that increase or decrease the tAI. P values are calculated from Wilcoxon rank sum tests. Figure S5 . Relationships between tAI, GC content and RNA folding. a Spearman correlation between tAI and GC content of genes. P value <2e-16. b Spearman correlation between GC content and the percentage of RNA structured regions of genes. P value <1e-3. c GC contents in versus out of RNA structured regions. P value is calculated from Fisher's exact test. d",
