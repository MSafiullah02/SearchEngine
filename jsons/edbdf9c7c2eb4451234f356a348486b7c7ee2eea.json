It is the balance between the net immune status of the subject and the load of the infecting inoculum that determines the severity of the illness.

In the laboratory these two forms are inter-convertible by altering the temperatures and nutrients of the growth medium. The disease is highly endemic in the Midwestern and southeastern parts of the US. It is estimated that 50-80% of people living in the Ohio and Mississippi river valleys have evidence of remote infection with histoplasma [7] Human and animal infections occurred after inhalation of aerosolized micro-conidia, the infecting particle, which can reach the alveolar space due to its very small size of 2 to 5 mm.

Due to their small size, microconidia can reach the alveolar space where they convert to the yeast form, a key step in the pathogenesis. The initial tissue response to the organism is predominantly neutrophilic, followed by an increase in alveolar macrophages [11] . After being phagocytosed, yeast survive and actually proliferate inside the macrophages, which serve then as a carrier throughout the reticuloendothelial system. Shortly after infection the yeast forms can be identified in the mediastinal lymph nodes. The fungus then gains access to the circulation. It is likely that transient self-limited fungemia occurs in most, if not all, patients. Later the yeast disseminates throughout the body to establish foci of infection in many organs, such as the liver, spleen and the adrenal glands [5] .",

Specimens obtained from bronchoscopy have a high but poorly defined yield in severe primary histoplasmosis with progressive ARDS and especially in PDH in AIDS, when diffuse infiltrates are one of the clinical features. In highly selected series the diagnostic yield of bronchoscopy for diagnosis of histoplasmosis in an endemic area is about 60% in patients with infiltrates [29] . In a strictly AIDS population in Indianapolis, Indiana, fungal stains performed on bronchoalveolar lavage fluid provided a rapid diagnosis in 70% of patients; diagnostic yield increased to 89% when culture results were included. In that series, 22% of patients had co-infections or alternative diagnoses that were detected by BAL and would not have been detected if Histoplasma antigen testing had been the sole diagnostic test [30] . Use of cytologic examination without special fungal staining (silver, PAS) may explain the lower yield of BAL reported in series from non-endemic areas [31] . It is likely best to do a battery of stains including a silver stain. Although transbronchial biopsy is not mandatory at the time of bronchoscopy and BAL, histopathology does appear to enhance the diagnostic yield [31] . The fungus is difficult to see on standard hematoxylin and eosin stains; special stains (usually a silver stain) are needed.

In heavily parasitized samples, a direct smear of the bone marrow, stained with a supravital stain such as the Giemsa stain, usually gives a rapid diagnosis ( Figure 2 ). On permanent histologic sections, the fungus is difficult to see on standard slides prepared with hematoxylin and eosin stain. It is best to go directly to special stains, usually one of several modifications of the silver stain or the PAS stain. Recently, the role of blood cultures in diagnosis of PDH has expanded. The lysis-centrifugation system increases sensitivity. In AIDS patients with PDH, the density of organisms is higher than in other immunosuppressed patients, and blood cultures are particularly useful, yielding a diagnosis in up to 90% of cases. In fact, in AIDS patients with PDH typical intracellular organisms can be seen directly on peripheral blood smears (buffy coat preparations) up to 50% of the time. Bronchoalveolar lavage also has a very high yield, both by direct smear and by culture in AIDS patients with high burden of organisms.

If blastomycosis is being considered in this setting, bronchoscopy with BAL can be the initial procedure, reserving transbronchial biopsy for cases with no diagnosis from a safer and easier first procedure.

Multiple infections often co-exist, adding additional value to diagnostic bronchoscopy early in the course of illness [75] , [76] . Bronchial washings and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid should be sent for cytology, fungal stains, and culture. In a recent study of an AIDS patient in Phoenix, Arizona, the Papanicolaou stain was the most useful direct test (when compared to KOH and calcofluor white) for rapid diagnosis of pulmonary coccidioidomycosis and was even positive in two patients with negative cultures [77] . Histopathologic examination of biopsy material is extremely helpful. When mature spherules (visible on standard hematoxylin and eosin stained tissue sections) are seen, the diagnosis is secure. More commonly, only endospores, immature spherules or spherule fragments are present. Therefore fungal stains such as a silver stain should always be used in addition to hematoxylin and eosin staining. In one study, transbronchial biopsy yielded a specific tissue diagnosis of coccidioidomycosis in eight of eight patients.",

Most asymptomatic skin test converters never have CF titers over 1:8, which is the threshold for a positive result. Most symptomatic patients have titers of 1:8 or 1:16. Titers of 1:32 or higher are generally associated with more severe infections and poorer prognosis. In the classic studies of Smith and colleagues [79], many patients with these high titers either had already undergone or were about to undergo dissemination. However, other patients with disseminated coccidioidomycosis did not have high titers. Also the cutoff of a 1:32 CF titer as a harbinger of dissemination never transferred perfectly to other laboratories that did not use the same method or the same antigen. A single CF titer, no matter how high, should never be used to make a diagnosis of disseminated coccidioidomycosis. Nonetheless, a steadily rising titer should raise the suspicion of disseminated coccidioidomycosis and prompt further tests (including bone scan, spinal tap, or both when appropriate) to better define the extent of disease.",

Similarly, many experts believed that all patients with pulmonary disease that is severe or persists beyond a few weeks should receive amphotericin B to approximately the same total dose to prevent local pulmonary progression and to prevent dissemination. In current practice, many such patients (and also less symptomatic patients with pulmonary coccidioidomycosis of shorter duration) are often given fluconazole for 3-6 months, reserving AMB for patients with diffuse infiltrates and women in the third trimester of pregnancy.
