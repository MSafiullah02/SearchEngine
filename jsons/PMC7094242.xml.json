The human coronavirus HcoV-229E replicase gene encodes two overlapping polyproteins [3], that mediate all the functions required for viral replication and transcription [4]. The functional polypeptides are released from the polyproteins by extensive proteolytic processing, which is primarily achieved by the 33.1-kDa main proteinase (Mpro) [5]. Mpro from HcoV-229E (MproH) has been biosynthesized in Escherichia coli and its enzyme properties have been well characterized [5], [6].",

Previous experimental data have shown that the differential cleavage kinetics of all coronaviruses is a conserved feature of Mpro\n[9]. Furthermore, the cleavage pattern appears to be conserved in Mpro from SARS-CoV (MproS) and from other coronaviruses [10], as deduced from the genome sequence [11], [12]. The functional importance of Mpro in the viral life cycle has made it an attractive target for the development of drugs directed against SARS and other coronavirus infections. Thus, screening the known proteinase inhibitor libraries may be an appreciated shortcut to discover anti-SARS drugs [13]. Crystal structures of MproH [10] and Mpro from porcine coronavirus (transmissible gastroenteritis virus, TGEV) (MproT) complexed with its inhibitor [14] have been determined. Comparison of these structures reveals a remarkable degree of structural conservation.",

In order to arrange the soaked water molecules randomly, water molecules alone were submitted to 10 000 iterations by conjugate gradient minimization, keeping the protein atoms fixed. The system composed of the minimized structures of protein and water molecules was then used as the starting image. Finally, 200 ps MD simulation with 5 ps in equilibrium step was carried out for each system using the Discover module of Insight II. The explicit image periodic boundary condition (PBC) was used for solvent equilibrium. The temperature and pressure were maintained for each MD simulation at 300 K and one atmosphere, respectively, as described by Berendsen et al. [20]. Cut-off radius of 10 \u00c5 for the non-bonded interactions was applied. The time-step of the MD simulations was 1 fs.

It indicates that MproS may follow the similar substrate binding mechanisms of MproT and MproH, allowing us to design anti-SARS drugs by simply screening the known proteinase inhibitors. The low sequence identity and secondary structure conservation in domain III among these proteins suggest that it may play a minor role in proteolytic activity. As shown in Table 2\n, the RMSDs of MproSH and MproST are 4.84 and 3.94 \u00c5, comparing to their corresponding templates, MproH and MproT, respectively; while the RMSD between MproSH and MproST is 5.78 \u00c5. It indicates that the structure of MproS is more similar to that of MproT.",

It is obvious that domain III exhibits higher structural variations than the other two domains in all cases. S1 was found to maintain its structural integrity, whereas S2 exhibits higher structural fluctuations during the entire MD simulations. It is attributed to that S2 is located on the open mouth of the catalytic cleft between domains I and II, whereas S1 is situated in the very bottom of this cleft and is well protected by the hydrophobic core. The higher structural variation of S2 makes it flexible enough to accommodate a bulky hydrophobic residue from the substrate.",

From a dynamics point of view (Fig. 4\n), the Cys144\u2013His41 distance of MproH fluctuated more rapidly than that of MproT. In addition, the Cys145\u2013His41 distances of MproSH fluctuated more rapidly than that of MproST beyond 150 ps. These results indicate that both MproT and MproST may exhibit more stable active site configurations than those of MproS and MproSH. The large degree of fluctuation of these Cys\u2013His distance may indicate that the structure of the catalytic site is not stable when it is not protected from substrate or ligand binding. This result is in very good agreement with the previous findings that there are significant differences in the flexibility in the active site of the SARS-CoV proteinase [25]. Furthermore, the high flexibility of the active site may allow these proteins to execute the catalytic process more efficiently.",

In MproS, S2 is lined by the side chains of His41, Asp48, Pro52, Met165, and Gln189. It indicates that S2 is not as conserved as S1 among these proteins. It is worthy of mentioning that the main chain of Leu164 of MproT (or Ile164 of MproH or Met165 of MproS) forms part of S1, while its side chain is involved in S2, indicating that these two subsites are somewhat influenced by each other towards substrate binding.",
