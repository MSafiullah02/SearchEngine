One meta\u2010analysis on the prevalence of dampness and mould in the European housing stock, including published data from 31 European countries, concluded that 12.1% of the homes in Europe had dampness, 10.3% indoor mould and 10.0% water damage 2. Even higher prevalence of dampness and mould in European homes were found in the European Community Respiratory Health Survey (ECRHS), where 24.8% of the participants reported that they had ever seen mould in their current home and 27.9% reported water damage. Researchers who visited a subset of the homes observed mould in 13.6% and damp spots in 18.2% of the homes 3. A number of review articles and meta\u2010analysis have been published suggesting associations between dampness and indoor mould and rhinitis 4, bronchitis and airway infections 5 and onset of asthma 6. These studies are mostly based on population samples and have not specifically studied exacerbation of asthma. One recent review on indoor environmental exposure has focused on exacerbation of asthma 7. They concluded that there is sufficient evidence of a causal association between outdoor culturable fungal exposure and exacerbation in asthmatics sensitized to fungi. They also concluded that there is limited or suggestive evidence of an association between indoor culturable Penicillium exposure and exacerbation in asthmatic children with specific sensitization, any fungal sensitization, or unspecific sensitization. Moreover, they concluded that there is limited or suggestive evidence of an association between indoor total culturable fungal exposure and exacerbation of asthma in children with any fungal sensitization. The study has no conclusions concerning exacerbation of asthma in adults in relation to indoor exposure to dampness or mould 7.",

Another prevalence study found associations between airway obstruction and higher concentration of 1,3\u2010beta\u2010glucan in homes, a marker of fungal exposure 10. One longitudinal European population study observed increased lung function decline (FEV1) in adults living in homes with dampness and mould, equivalent to smoking 5\u201310 cigarettes per day 11. Finally, one study found that asthmatic patients living in homes with confirmed dampness had lower FEV1 than those living in dry homes 12.",

            "text": "Dampness in buildings has been defined broadly and most existing data on building dampness and mould but it is unclear which is exposure that is the causative agent in damp buildings 1. One consequence of building dampness is an increased growth of bacteria and mould on indoor surfaces and inside the building construction. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS, endotoxin) and peptidoglycan are the two most studied bacterial cell\u2010wall compounds. LPS is a chemical marker for Gram\u2010negative bacteria 13. Endotoxin is mostly measured by the biological limulus test 13 but 3\u2010hydroxy fatty acids from endotoxin can also be measured by chemical analysis 14. Peptidoglycan is found in all bacteria but in the largest amounts in Gram\u2010positive bacteria 15. Muramic acid (MuA) is an amino sugar, is found exclusively in peptidoglycan and can be measured by similar chemical analysis 14, 15. Associations between endotoxin concentration in indoor dust and respiratory health, including asthma and allergies, have been studied in a large number of studies. The effect can depend on exposure timing, dosage, environmental cofactors and genetics 16. Radon has summarized the effects of endotoxin with respect to different phenotypes of asthma. The risk of atopic asthma, dominated by eosinophilic response, is decreased in those exposed to endotoxin. In contrast, the risk of non\u2010atopic asthma, characterized by a neutrophilic response, is enhanced in subjects with higher endotoxin exposure 13.",

Moreover, there is some evidence of protective effects from fungal exposure on allergies from studies on children in farming environments 17. Chemical analysis of ergosterol 14 and analysis of beta\u20101\u20103 glucan in dust by the limulus method 10 has been used as markers of total fungal load. Detection and quantification of indoor mould is now possible using mould\u2010specific quantitative polymerase chain reaction (real time PCR) 18, 19. This molecular method can give quantitative data on the occurrence of the most common indoor moulds, irrespectively of viability. EPA scientists have designed and tested primers and probes for over 100 types of mould (http://www.epa.gov/microbes/moldtech.htm). The method is called mould\u2010specific quantitative PCR (MSQPCR) 19, 20.",

One way is to analyse health association between the concentrations of each fungal DNA sequence in dust or air and the health parameter, mostly asthma or asthmatic symptoms. Two prevalence studies in schools found associations between the concentration of certain fungal DNA sequences in school dust (e.g. from Aspergillus versicolor and Streptomyces) and respiratory symptoms 23, 24 as well as lower FEV1 24 in the pupils. One case\u2013control study reported that levels of Aspergillus versicolor DNA were higher in asthmatics homes as compared to controls 25.

The ERMI value is computed by quantifying the concentration of species\u2010specific DNA sequences from 36 indicator mould species in home dust samples. The mould species are divided in two groups. The first group (group 1 mould) consists of 26 mould species that indicate water damage. The second group (group 2 mould) consists of sequences from 10 Group 2 species that can be from outdoor sources and these moulds are commonly found even without water damage 27. For each home, the mould burden is computed by taking the sum of log\u2010transformed group 1 mould species concentrations minus the sum of log\u2010transformed group 2 mould species concentrations. The ERMI value does not measure the total fungal concentration in the dust or the total fungal exposure. It is used as a way to rank homes with respect to the relative mould burden in homes 28, 29, 30.",

One longitudinal study found that early exposure to moulds as measured by ERMI at 1 year of age, but not 7 years of age, increased the risk for asthma at 7 years of age 35.

One recent study found an association between ERMI values in home dust and asthma and rhinitis in adults 38. Moreover, few studies have investigated exacerbation of asthma from mould, assessed by the ERMI\u2010index. Recently, in Clinical and Experimental Allergy, McSharry et al. 39 have extended the use of the ERMI\u2010index and other microbial markers in the home environment to study exacerbation of asthma, measured as decreased FEV1% among non\u2010smoking adult asthmatics in Scotland. They also studied associations between FEV1% and corticosteroid use, asthma control Questionnaire score (ACQ) and St. George's Respiratory questionnaire score. FEV1% were negatively correlated with ACQ and SGRQ scores and weakly with corticosteroid use. Higher ERMI values in home dust were associated with decreased FEV1% but there was no correlation between FEV1 and other biological contaminants such as concentrations of endotoxin, 1,3\u2010beta\u2010glucan or cat allergen (Fel d 1), dog allergen (Can f 1) or house dust mite allergens (Der p 1 or Der p 2) in home dust 39. The study adds evidence on the possible role of mould as a cause of exacerbation of asthma in adults and also links the ERMI\u2010index to airway obstruction measured as FEV1. The study supports the view that measurement of fungal DNA in dust in epidemiological studies can be a useful indicator of fungal exposure in indoor environments. Moreover, the study supports the view that the ERMI\u2010index has relevance for respiratory health and can be a useful indicator of relative fungal burden in indoor environments. The ERMI\u2010index may also be useful in patient investigations to identify patients that need to improve their home environment.",

Moreover, respiratory effects of different types of indoor biological contaminants, including fungal DNA measured by mould\u2010specific quantitative PCR and calculation of the ERMI\u2010index, should be extended from the home environment to other indoor environments such as day care centres, schools, hospitals and offices.
