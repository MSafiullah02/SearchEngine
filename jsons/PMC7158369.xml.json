Nondegenerate neutrophils are morphologically normal with mature condensed chromatin and well-segmented purple lobes. These neutrophils predominate in relatively nontoxic environments such as immune-mediated diseases (Fig. 2-7A\n), neoplastic lesions (Fig. 2-7B), and sterile conditions caused by irritants such as urine and bile (Fig. 2-7C). Degenerate neutrophils display early signs of oncotic necrosis with observable cellular and nuclear swelling with decreased nuclear stain intensity. In cytology, this early recognizable change is termed karyolysis (Fig. 2-8\n). Karyolysis is attributed to decreased mitochondria function to produce ATP that maintains transmembrane ion pumps resulting in an influx of sodium, calcium, and water (hydropic degeneration) as well as to damaged cell membranes that result in release of endonucleases that degrade RNA and DNA. This often indicates rapid cell death in a toxic or injurious environment (Perman et al., 1979). Degenerate neutrophils predominate in bacterial infections, particularly gram-negative types that produce endotoxins. Cytologically, under conditions of neutrophil degeneration, small infectious agents must be found intracellularly to confidently report it as septic neutrophilic inflammation (Fig. 2-9\n).",

If pyknosis is related to a slow, progressive change within a relatively nontoxic environment, an intact cell membrane may be present around the shrunken, more eosinophilic cell as occurs with normal cell aging. An end stage of nuclear breakdown termed karyorrhexis or karyorhexis (Mastrorilli et al., 2013) may be seen as the result of pyknosis of hypersegmented nuclei (Fig. 2-8) or fragmentation of chromatin of an individual dying cell (Fig. 2-11\n) as seen on both cytology and histology. Histiocytic or macrophagic lesions contain a predominance of macrophages, suggesting chronic inflammation (Fig. 2-12\n). Foamy, often vacuolated, and phagocytic cells characterize this type of inflammation. In contrast, granulomatous lesions consisting of activated macrophages that morphologically resemble epithelial cells form in response to foreign material or persistent intracellular infectious agents and have a secretory rather than phagocytic activity. These cells are therefore termed epithelioid macrophages and recognized by their abundant basophilic cytoplasm and large polygonal shape (Fig. 2-13A\n). Epithelioid macrophages under the influence of cytokines and other inflammatory mediators undergo macrophage fusion to form giant multinucleated forms (Fig. 2-13B\n). Granulomas are often associated with foreign body reactions and mycobacterial infections and may be recognized cytologically by the presence of epithelioid macrophages and/or multinucleate cells.",

Lymphoglandular bodies (Fig. 2-20\n) are cytoplasmic fragments from fragile cells, usually lymphocytes, which are discrete, round, lightly basophilic structures (Flanders et al., 1993). Nuclear streaming refers to linear pink to purple strands of nuclear remnants (Fig. 2-21\n) produced by excessive tissue handling during cytologic preparation or with necrotic material when sampled. Clear to light-pink amorphous strands representing collagen (Fig. 2-22A\n) may be admixed with spindle cells and endothelium within a fibrovascular stroma. However, when these collagen fibers undergo damage (as in the collagenolysis associated with mast cell tumor), degranulating eosinophils release collagenase that produces dense, hyalinized pink collagen bands (Fig. 2-22B). Amyloid is an uncommon pathologic protein found in tissues composed of several types between cells (Woldenmeskel, 2012). It appears amorphous, eosinophilic, and hyaline and may be associated with chronic inflammation, plasma cell tumors (see Fig. 3-54E&F), or familial amyloidosis (Fig. 2-22C).",
