Several methods are currently being evaluated such as protease and glycosylated spike (S) protein inhibitors, that outlines the main fusion site among coronavirus and host cells. Notwithstanding, the Heptad Repeat 1 (HR1) domain on the glycosylated spike (S) protein is the region with less mutability and then the most encouraging target for new inhibitors drugs. The novelty of the proposed approach, compared to others, lies in a precise training of a deep neural network toward the 2019-nCoV virus. Where a Siamese Neural Network (SNN) has been trained to distingue the whole 2019-nCoV protein sequence amongst two different viruses family such as HIV-1 and Ebola. In this way, the present deep learning system has precise knowledge of peptide linkage among 2019-nCoV protein structure and differently, of other works, is not trivially trained on public datasets that have not been provided any ligand-peptide information for 2019-nCoV. Suddenly, the SNN shows a sensitivity of 83% of peptide affinity classification, where 3027 peptides on SATPdb bank have been tested towards the specific region HR1 of 2019-nCoV exhibiting an affinity of 93% for the peptidylprolyl cis-trans isomerase (PPIase) peptide. This affinity between PPIase and HR1 can open new horizons of research since several scientific papers have already shown that CsA immunosuppression drug, a main inhibitor of PPIase, suppress the reproduction of different CoV virus included SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Finally, to ensure the scientific reproducibility, code and data have been made public at the following link: https://github.com/bionick87/2019-nCoV.",

The first approach is the virus protease inhibition that prevents the virus from polypeptide filaments to be split and therefore the viral core proteins cannot be built. For instance, Nelfinavir, an HIV-1 protease inhibitor to treat HIV, was prophesied to be a likely inhibitor of 2019-nCoV principal protease by different molecular docking computationalbased [5] . The second strategy is targeting the glycosylated spike (S) protein in the fusion with the entry of the host cell [6] , which represents the most promising target for developing new inhibitors for the target site spike (S) S-HR1 [7, 8] . Notwithstanding, it is unclear whether 2019-nCoV also holds a similar fusion and entry mechanism as that of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and if true, consequently, the S-HR1 site can also serve as an important target for the development of 2019-nCoV fusion/entry inhibitors. Though, it is also unexplored if 2019-nCoV also exists other comparable fusion and entry mechanisms with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV [9] .",

Specifically, protein spike (S) is made up of two subunits: S1 and S2. The S1 subunit binds the cell receptor with its receptor-binding domain (RBD), followed by a set of conformation changes in the S2 subunit, allowing the fusion peptide to enter the cell membrane of the host cell. In the S2 region, we find another region called heptad repeat 1 (HR1) with three hydrophobic grooves that bind to a high region called heptad repeat 2 (HR2) forming a structure with six helices (6-HB), which helps to bring the two membranes closer together for the final fusion and hence the entrance. The RBD of any CoV family is a highly mutable region and not suitable for inhibition, while the HR region in the S2 subunit is conserved among various HCoVs [8] .",

Though, this one-shot learning system reduces the use of specific datasets, enabling directly work on the available biological data. In other words, the network learns to discriminate target examples on its protein domain from other domains with completely different biological characteristics without the explicit use of a specific dataset. Further is then applied deep SNN which i) lean generic image functionality to make inference on unknown distributions. ii) provide a valid approach that explores solutions on the unknown domain without relying on a trivial supervised training dataset (i.e. peptide ligand correspondence). iii) use several states-of-the-art CNN previously pre-trained on huge datasets.",

The peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase (further known as peptidylprolyl isomerase or PPIase) is an enzyme (Fig 5) that transforms the cis and trans isomers with the amino acid proline [36] . The two major families of PPIase are Cyps and the FK506-binding proteins (FKBPs) where the Cyps are implicated in a broad spectrum of cellular processes including cell signaling, protein folding, and protein trafficking [37] . The affinity between HR1 and PPIase may play an essential role in the identification of PPIase inhibitors as several therapies with CsA immunosuppression drugs [38, 39] . Several scientific papers have noted that, in cellular culture, the reproduction of different CoV (included SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV) can be inhibited by CsA therapy [40, 41, 42] . A well recognized CsA immunosuppression drug is the Sirolimus a PPIase inhibitor that has been shown to enhance results of patients with intractable H1N1 pneumonia [43] , where recent computational studies show how Sirolimus can be also selected as a potential drug for 2019-nCoV [44] ; confirming what has been observed in this work on HR1 and PPIase affinity. In order to provide the reproducibility of this work, the code and data has been made available to the scientific community at https://github.com/bionick87/2019-nCoV. Future work is thus still needed to confirm the association mechanism between HR1 and PPIase through molecular docking studies, therefore important for understanding biological mechanisms of PPIase on 2019-nCoV.
