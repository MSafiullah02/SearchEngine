            "text": "The use of face masks for the general public has been suggested in literature as a means to decrease virus transmission during the global COVID-19 pandemic. However, literature findings indicate that most mask designs do not provide reliable protection. This paper investigates the hypothesis that the impaired protection is mainly due to imperfect fitting of the masks, so that airflow, which contains virus-transporting droplets, can leak through gaps into or out of the mask. The fluid dynamics of face masks are investigated via analytical and numerical computations. The results demonstrate that the flow can be satisfactorily predicted by simplified analytical 1D-flow models, by efficient 2D-flow simulations and by 3D-flow simulations. The present results show that already gap heights larger than 0.1 mm can result in the mask not fulfilling FFP2 or FFP3 standards, and for gap heights of ca. 1 mm most of the airflow and droplets may pass through the gap. The implications of these findings are discussed and improvements to existing mask designs are suggested.",

Opposing arguments include that masks should be reserved for healthcare workers and that the use of medical masks in the community may create a false sense of security (World Health Organization, 2020) . However, the global shortage of masks may not persist indefinitely so that protective masks may become available to the public in future. Arguments in favor of using face masks for the general public include indications by several studies that face masks can reduce viral exposure and infection risks (e.g. van der Sande et al., 2008) . Protective effects of masks were demonstrated for various severe infections such as SARS, tuberculosis and pandemic influenza (e.g. Andersen, 2019; Jung et al., 2014, and references therein) and also for dust, oil, or combustion-exhaust particles (Penconek et al., 2012; Ntlailane and Wichmann, 2019) .",

            "text": "Virus transmission can occur via direct contact with secretions and via exhaled water droplets (Tellier, 2006) . The former risk can be reduced by hygiene practices, such as hand washing and not touching one's face; furthermore, the virus was found to survive at most several days on surfaces (Kampf et al., 2020) . However, reducing the risk of virus transmission via droplets is complicated by the different particle sizes, which roughly range from larger droplets in the order of 100 \u00b5m to smaller aerosol-size droplets in the order of < 1 \u00b5m (Tellier, 2006; Fabian et al., 2008) . Larger particles (> 20 \u00b5m) have shorter settling times, i.e. they fall to the ground within seconds up to a few minutes. Smaller particles, however, may float in the air for hours and particles with a diameter < 3 \u00b5m essentially do not settle (Tellier, 2006) . Thus virus-contaminated droplets may accumulate in closed rooms such as workplaces or public transportation. Although at present it is not known how long the virus remains infectious, results by van Doremalen et al. (2020) indicate that the virus could survive several hours in aerosols-size droplets, and Asadi et al. (2020) conclude from their literature review that even the smallest aerosol-size droplets might be able to transmit the virus during face-to-face conversation with an asymptomatic infected individual. Fabian et al. (2008) found that humans exhale > 500 droplets per liter of air, of which 99.9% had diameters between 0.3 \u00b5m and 5 \u00b5m, and 87% were smaller than 1 \u00b5m. That most exhaled particles have diameters below 1 \u00b5m has been confirmed by other authors (e.g. Fairchild and Stampfer, 1987; Papineni and Rosenthal, 1997; Edwards et al., 2004) . Thus this work focuses on particles smaller than 5 \u00b5m.",

Alternatively, the protection factor (PF) can be used, for which holds PF = 1/TIL (van der Sande et al., 2008) . Milton et al. (2013) found that surgical masks reduced the number of influenza virus droplet that were emitted by ca. 75% compared to test persons not wearing masks if the droplets were larger than 5 \u00b5m, but for smaller droplets the surgical masks provided no substantial protection. Therefore, in the following the focus will be only on FFP-masks, which are typically more effective than surgical or home-made masks (van der Sande et al., 2008) . FFP-masks can be subdivided in classes FFP1 to FFP3 with filtration efficiencies of 80% (FFP1), 94% (FFP2) and 99% (FFP3), respectively, and leakage rates of less than 22% (FFP1), 8% (FFP2) and 2% (FFP3) (cf. Seidler et al., 2004; Lee et al., 2016; European norm EN 149:2001+A1:2009 ). Thus technically it would appear that FFP3-masks provide satisfactory protection, and indeed they are widely used in hospitals. As outlined in the following, though, literature suggests that many FFP3-masks do not provide reliable protection, especially if not properly fitted. Steinle et al. (2018) investigated FFP2-masks with median filtration efficiency of FE \u2265 98% and found that the total inward leakage varied between 0% \u2264 TIL \u2264 84.4%. Cherrie et al. (2018) , Lee et al. (2016) and Jung (2014) reported similar values and argued that, regardless of the quality of the filter materials, FFP-type masks may not provide reliable protection if the mask does not fit tightly. Lee et al. (2017) reported face-seal leakage surrounding the chin and the cheeks for FFP-masks, because the masks did not fit all wearers. Furthermore, they observed that the percentage of particles that penetrated through face-seal leaks increased for low air intake and for particle diameters below 0.1 \u00b5m. Children were found to be less protected by FFP-type masks, which was attributed to inferior fitting of the masks on smaller faces (van der Sande et al., 2008) .",

In the following, a more efficient approach was selected so that the flow problem remains two-dimensional and the computational effort remains low. Consider that, if the gap were closed (H g = 0), the flow rate through the mask filter F m = F t , so the average velocity through the mask filter is u m = u t S t /S m . If the gap width B g is halved, the domain size in z-direction and thus S t and S m are halved as well. To maintain the same flow rate F t , u t and thus also u m are doubled. The solution domain was discretized with a rectilinear grid with local mesh refinement as shown in Fig. 3 , so that the gap was resolved with at least 10 cells per gap height H g . For the grid dependence study, the grids were refined uniformly by halving the cells in xand y-directions. Depending on the gap size, the grids consisted of ca. 10 000 to 160 000 cells. To verify that the conclusions drawn from the 2Dflow simulations are applicable to realistic 3D-flow through face masks, also 3D-flow simulations were performed for a few representative configurations.",

As Fig. 6 , except for logarithmic vertical axis Figure 8 shows that the pressure drop across the mask filter can decrease by more than 75% when the gap height is increased to H g = 1 mm. This makes breathing easier, which could tempt mask wearers not to tighten the mask to the face, with the consequence that up to ca. 70% of the air flows unfiltered through the gap into the mask. Figure 9 shows pressure and velocities within the gap for a representative configuration. The results show similar trends as those for C m = 2000 m/s, and although the filter resistance is halved, the flow rate through the gap reduces only by 10 \u2212 20% in most cases. Thus, the choice of filter material has a comparatively small influence concerning how large the gap height H g may be before the mask ceases to fulfill FFP3 requirements.

Therefore, Fig. 13 presents analytical predictions with-out backup from simulation data. The figure shows that when the gap height is small (a few multiples of 0.1 mm), then changing the seal thickness (i.e. the gap length) from a thin seal (L g = 0.1 cm) to a wide seal (L g = 2 cm) can change the gap flow rate F g by factor 10 or more.

Fig. 4 ) for three cases denoted setups A, B, and C. These differ mainly with regard to the gap shape, flow rate and flow direction, as summarized in Table 1 . The first 3D-flow simulation results (setup A from Table 1) correspond to inhaling during normal breathing with a mask that fits tightly over the whole perimeter, except for a very small gap (average gap height H g = 0.26 mm and gap width B g = 2.5 cm, cf. Figs. 4 and 14). Table 1 Figures 14-15 show that the analytical predictions for gap flow rate and pressure within the mask agree well with 3D-flow simulation results, demonstrating that previous assumptions were justified. The results show that the pressure (not shown) can indeed be approximated as constant within the mask. The largest flow velocities occur within the gap, as expected. Although the gap is very small, 1.84% of the flow enters the mask through the gap, which just fulfills FFP3requirements that leakage must be below 2%. Thus if there would be another such gap below the other eye, or if the seal would be slightly thinner (i.e. smaller gap length L g ), FFP3-requirements would not be fulfilled. Fig. 15 . Analytical predictions and 3D-flow simulation results for the flow rate F g through the gap as percentage of the total flow rate F t = 30 L/min (top) and pressure drop \u2206p across the filter (bottom), as a function of gap height H g ; for the human head and realistic mask geometry from Fig. 4 with setup A from Table 1 The second 3D-flow simulation results (setup B from Table 1 ) correspond to inhaling and exhaling during either normal breathing or deep breathing with a mask that fits tightly over the whole perimeter, except for two small gaps (average gap height H g = 0.66 mm and total gap width B g = 2.16 cm). Figure 16 shows that, although the gaps are still comparatively small, between 8.9% (inhaling with total flow rate F t = 95 L/min) and 15% (exhaling with total flow rate F t = 30 L/min) of the flow enters or leaves the mask through the gap unfiltered, i.e. neither FFP3-nor FFP2-requirements (i.e. less than 8% leakage) are fulfilled. As before, the percentage flow through the gap is larger for lower flow rates. The gap flow rates F g were ca. 10% larger for exhaling than for inhaling, which was attributed to the different edge angles at gap inlet and outlet for this specific geometry (i.e. different resistance for entering the gap). The agreement with analytical results from the 1D model is again remarkably good. Table 1 , both for inhaling and exhaling",

Figure 17 shows that the gap directs the airflow towards the eyes with comparatively large velocities (locally more than 8 m/s, i.e. up to Beaufort number 5 'fresh breeze'). Figure 18 shows how the exhaled breath from the nostrils hits the mask, is diverted sideways, partially passes through the mask with low velocities and partially is accelerated through the narrow gap and blows against the eyes and the forehead. If the mask is worn in combination with glasses, such a flow can be visualized by the fogging of the glasses.

Moreover, the present findings indicate that the large variation in protection observed for FFP2-and FFP3-type masks in literature (with total inward leakage of 80% or more for some test participants) resulted from imperfect fitting of the masks. Already for gaps which can hardly be distinguished by the naked eye, the mask may loose most of its protection. Therefore, it appears that the design of many typical FFP-type masks does not adequately consider the importance of tight fitting of the mask and may not provide reliable protection. Thus, fit-testing with suitable instruction can be recommended (cf. Lepelletier et al., 2019) .",

Only large droplets that do not follow the flow of air may be filtered more effectively. Future work could model larger droplets as Lagrangian particles, to determine via flow simulations the amount of larger droplets that pass through the gap as a function of the particle size and gap location.",

This material should be flexible enough to allow tight fitting for different face geometries, which can be achieved by selecting a deformable material and pressing it tightly against the face by adjustable bands. Furthermore, the material should be com-fortable enough to allow wearing durations of several hours. An example for such a material are the ear-pieces of typical passive noise-cancelling headphones. The mask filter can be made of the same materials used so far. The shape of the filter is not important because the present results show that the pressure within the mask is basically uniform. The suggested improved design is illustrated in Fig. 19 . Fig. 19 . Design suggestion for a tight-fitting FFPtype mask: a flexible headphone earpiece (white) with cushion cross-sectional diameter of ca. 2 cm is pressed onto the face by two adjustable bands (red) with sufficient pressure so that no gap occurs; to the other side of the earpiece, a suitable filter material of arbitrary shape is fitted tightly; in this manner a reusable mask can be constructed which provides satisfactory protection and can be comfortably worn for several hours",

One-way valves can reduce the breathing effort and humidity inside the mask: When exhaling, the valve opens a gap of height H g \u2248 1 \u2212 4 mm and width B g \u2248 2 cm. Thus from the present results it can be expected that for these masks most air leaves the mask through the valve unfiltered. Therefore, such a mask does not provide adequate protection for others when worn by an infected person. Especially, such masks should not be worn by healthcare workers or other professions where the risk of being infected is increased. For pandemic viruses such as COVID19, which survives at most several days on surfaces (Kampf et al., 2020) , ordinary citizens may only require a few masks, which can be stored in a dry, warm place and after a few days can be reused, and thus would remain reusable for years. With suitable material choice, the mask can even be disinfected more quickly, for example by placing it in an oven at temperatures in the order of 80 \u2022 C for ca. half an hour (Mackenzie, 2020) . In this manner, production and distribution of FFP3masks for the general public can be realized comparatively cost-effectively, so that social and economic consequences of a pandemic might be reduced by this measure.",

The under-relaxation factors were 0.8 for velocities and 0.2 for pressure. The initial conditions were pressure p = p \u221e , velocity u = 0 and density \u03c1 air = 1.2 kg/m 3 . The time step was \u2206t = 0.004 s and 6 outer iterations were performed per time step. The total simulated time was selected t end = 0.5 s, at which point a converged, quasi-steady solution was obtained in all simulations. Detailed information on finite-volume-based flow simulations can be found e.g. inFerziger et al. (2020).",
