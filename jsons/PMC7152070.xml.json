Although ostrich farming became well established on the African, American, European, and Australian continents in the second half of the 20th century, wild ostriches have become exceedingly rare in some parts of their range. South Africa and East Africa still hold strong populations, but most of the S. c. camelus subspecies populations in West and North Africa are considered endangered.14, 19 The Rheidae, the only family to the suborder Rheae, are endemic to the Neotropical Region and include two species: (1) the Common or Greater Rhea (Rhea americana) and (2) the Darwin's or Lesser Rhea (Pterocnemia pennata). Although neither species is reckoned to be in immediate danger, both have been listed as near-threatened, and their numbers are declining in most parts.19 The close genetic relationship between the families Dromaiidae (emus) and Casuariidae (cassowaries) is recognized by the common suborder Casuarii. Emus consist of one single species (Dromaius novaehollandiae) and occur in stable populations on mainland Australia, and the cassowaries constitute three clearly distinguishable species (Southern cassowary, Casuarius casuarius; Dwarf cassowary, C. bennetti; Northern cassowary, C. unappendiculatus), with a high number of subspecies.19 All three species occur in altitudinally separate habitats in New Guinea, and the Southern cassowary also occurs in the northern parts of Australia. Because of defragmentation and reduction of their rain forest habitat, cassowaries are considered endangered.19, 41 The fifth ratite family, the kiwis (Apterygidae), is endemic to New Zealand and consists of three species (Brown Kiwi, Apteryx australis; Little Spotted Kiwi, A. owenii; Great Spotted Kiwi, A. haastii). Habitat destruction, inadvertent poisoning and trapping for pest control, and introduced predator species have greatly reduced their numbers and rendered some populations endangered, but because of their reclusive way of living, their status is poorly known.29\n",

The wings are vestigial and carry variable numbers of claws (two in ostriches, one in rheas, none in emus and cassowaries) and are used for balance and display behavior. Ratites have long, heavily muscled legs, which enable them to run at high speeds; they also use their legs for defense and offense, kicking forward, with cassowaries using both feet at once. Ratites lack a patella. Whereas emus, cassowaries, and rheas have tridactyle feet with a nail on all toes, the ostrich only has two toes (didactyl) with a nail on the larger, medial toe only. Cassowaries carry a daggerlike, dangerously sharp claw on the inner toe. Kiwis have a small fourth toe pointing caudally with a spurlike nail.18, 19, 52, 53\n",

Other than in the rhea, in which the proventriculus is significantly smaller than the ventriculus, both compartments are similarly sized and connected by a large, rather indistinct sphincter in the ostrich and small stones for grinding are physiologically found in both compartments. Ostriches show a unique arrangement of the two gastric compartments, with the thin, saclike proventriculus taking a turn and the gizzard being located cranioventrally. Whereas the rhea largely depends on enormous paired ceca for effective hindgut fermentation, the ostrich has a particularly voluminous colon and long rectum and relatively smaller ceca. Spiral folds within the cecal lumen provide an increased surface area for fermentation. Following the adaption to a more nutritive and less fibrous diet, the proventriculus in emus and cassowaries is comparably large and diffusely glandular, whereas the small ventriculus is thin walled and lacks a koilin layer altogether in the cassowaries. The paired ceca in emus and cassowaries are vestigial and of minor functional importance, particularly in the cassowary. The gastrointestinal (GI) passage time is approximately 48 hours and 18 hours in ostriches and rheas, respectively, but only 7 hours in emus.53 In all ratites, a particularly strong rectal\u2013coprodeal sphincter results in separate defecation and voiding of urine: feces are stored in the rectum, whereas urine is mainly stored in the proctodeum, which acts as \u201cbladder.\u201d18 Ratites lack a true bursa; instead, the bursa of Fabricius in the ostrich and emu forms an integral part of the dorsolateral wall of the proctodeum. No gallbladder exists in the ostrich, but one is present in the other ratites.53\n",

In zoologic institutions, ostriches, rheas, and emus are commonly included in multispecies exhibits with other herbivores. In the wild, ostrich groups move and feed with herds of hoofstock, but they tend to avoid close contact with other animals. If startled or challenged, ostriches may react with panicky escapes; therefore, exhibits need to provide sufficient space and structures to allow avoidance or flight behavior. Barriers have to be easily visible, as ostriches, emus, and rheas tend to get entangled and caught in piles of branches, wires, and dry moats. Large ratites are usually kept in open paddocks and fenced pastures.18 Ratites need indoor enclosures or at least dry shelters to be protected against wind and precipitation. They may tolerate cold temperatures and even snow for short periods, but they are sensitive to cold-wet conditions.45 As waterproofing is impossible because of the lack of interlocking barbules, ratites get sodden in rain, and they lack down feathers for insulation.19 Indoors areas with heated or at least well-insulated flooring are imperative for hatchlings and juveniles.18\n",

Ratites jump, kick, and slash in a forward direction; therefore, manual restraint of large ratites may be dangerous and requires experienced personnel.47, 52 The risk of injury from the daggerlike claw does not allow for manual restraint of adult cassowaries.47 Ostriches, emus, and rheas may be approached from behind or the side. At least three people are needed to handle an adult bird, but care needs to be taken not to grab the bird by the neck (neck hooks are not recommended), the legs, or the vestigial wings or to interfere with respiration during straddling.47, 52, 53 In ostriches, lowering the head quickly to the ground prevents them from kicking, and they may even assume sternal recumbency. Darkness has a calming effect on ratites, and hooding is one of the best aids to handle manually restrained ostriches.52 Other ratite species are less tolerant of hooding, and the effect is unpredictable.53 As ratites are prone to exertional myopathy, chemical restraint is advisable for any longer procedure to reduce stress and risk of injury to birds and handlers.52\n",

For remote injection of anesthetic drugs in larger birds, the ideal dart placement is perpendicular into the proximal thigh muscle.53 Underdosing may result in overexertion during the excitatory phase and should be avoided. Benzodiazepines (diazepam or midazolam 0.3 to 1 milligram per kilogram [mg/kg]) and \u03b12-agonists (xylazine 0.2 to 3 mg/kg, medetomidine 0.05 to 0.5 mg/kg) are commonly used alone or in combination with butorphanol (0.1 to 0.2 mg/kg) for sedation and premedication, but times to effect and efficacy are highly variable and depend on the disposition of the bird.42, 52, 53 Ketamine (3 to 20 mg/kg) or telazol (2.3 to 4.9 mg/kg) are commonly used as induction agents but need to be combined with benzodiazepines or \u03b12-agonists to prevent muscle rigidity and rough induction and recoveries.47, 53 Injectable agents rarely provide anesthesia of sufficient duration for longer procedures, and inhalants (usually isoflurane) are commonly used for maintenance.42, 52, 53 Intubation is achieved easily with the tracheal opening readily visible at the base of the tongue.47 The unique tracheal cleft in emus necessitates wrapping of the lower neck with an elastic bandage to avoid insufflation of the pouch.47, 53 Alternatively, intravenous (IV) maintenances on a triple-drip combination (ketamine, xylazine, and guaifenesin) or propofol infusion are described in the literature.47 Ratites appear rather refractory to the sedative effects of potentiated opioids but show excessive running or frenzied activity during the excitatory phase and apnea during anesthesia.47 However, combinations of thiafentanil, \u03b12-agonists, and telazol have shown promising results in emus and rheas.6, 17, 38\n",

A left lateral approach over the proventriculus is preferred. Failure to adequately absorb the yolk sac may necessitate removal of the yolk sac in chicks, which is usually performed with a ventral midline approach, cranial of the umbilicus to beyond the extension of the yolk sac.52, 53 After excising the umbilical cord, the yolk sac is lifted out of the coelomic cavity and the duct ligated. Any spillage of yolk requires vigorous rinsing with warm saline. As in all other birds, egg binding may have to be addressed surgically, and castration of male ratites has been performed successfully.18, 53\n",

The pathogenicity in ratites depends on the viral strains, with particularly high mortality reported in H7N1 outbreaks among juvenile ostriches. Chicks are more susceptible than adults, and secondary bacterial respiratory and intestinal infections sometimes mask the underlying viral infection.12, 52 Despite the highly contagious nature of avian paramyxovirus serotype 1 (Newcastle disease) during an outbreak, chronic neurologic disease in ostriches tends to spread relatively slowly through the population, is usually limited to a small number of birds (mostly juveniles), and may therefore be controlled with vaccinations. Emus have tested serologically positive, but no cases of clinical disease have been described.2, 12, 30, 52 In contrast to the pathogenesis in most other avian species, eastern equine encephalitis virus does not cause neurologic disease in emus and rheas but shows a unique visceral tropism, primarily leading to GI symptoms.52, 53, 55 Avian poxvirus may manifest as either wet or dry forms. Vaccination with fowl pox vaccines has proven effective in ostriches.12, 52, 53 Bornavirus infection has been reported to have resulted in outbreaks of paresis and general malaise, followed by anorexia, depression, and death from dehydration in ostrich chicks in intensive farming conditions.12, 53 Both adenovirus and circovirus were isolated from sick ostrich chicks and were suspected to be implicated in the \u201cchick-fading syndrome.\u201d22, 40, 53 Miscellaneous viral pathogens reported in ratites include infectious bursal disease virus (only experimental disease, no natural infections reported),35, 53 rotaviruses, orthoreoviruses, and reoviruses (serologically positive samples or viral isolation, but clinical relevance remained unclear),18, 53 and Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF), a tick-transmitted disease occurring across the African continent, that causes a short, symptomless viremia in sheep, cattle, and ostriches and has fatal zoonotic potential (through handling of tick-infested ostriches or through contact with infected ostrich blood during slaughter).12\n",

Heavy parasitic load may lead to proventriculitis with associated weight loss and anemia and to high mortality in chicks and juveniles.15, 18, 36, 53 The parasite appears to be rather host specific but may infect other ratites such as rheas. Similarly, in rheas, Sicarius uncinipenis, a reddish worm, inserts itself between the koilin layer and the ventricular mucosa and leads to destruction of the koilin layer.53, 56 In addition, the large-intestine nematodes Paradeletrocephalus minor and Deletrocephalus dimidiatus are considered to be of some relevance because of their blood-feeding habits, which may, in high infections, be associated with an anemia syndrome in rheas.36, 56\nTrichostrongylus tenuis has been found in the ceca of emus, and pathogenicity is comparable with that in game birds. A low burden might remain clinically unapparent, but large numbers of parasites may result in bloody diarrhea, progressive anemia, and toxemia.36, 53\nCodiostomum struthionis is a slightly larger helminth, which inhabits the distal cecum and upper rectum of adult ostriches but is mostly clinically inapparent.18, 36, 53\nHouttuynia struthionis is a large tapeworm, which inhabits the small intestine of ostriches and rheas, causing ill-thrift in young ostriches.15, 18, 36, 53\nFasciola hepatica has been associated with subacute and chronic hepatitis in emus. Antiparasitic treatment with triclabendazole may be necessary in severely affected birds, and separation of hoofstock carriers and pasture management are recommended. Although no reports of clinically apparent fasciolosis exist, chronic fasciolosis was identified in the livers of healthy slaughtered rheas.36, 54 The finding of extraintestinal filarial worms (Dicheilonema rhea, D. spicularia, Contortospiculum rhea, Paronchocerca struthionis, Struthiofilaria megalocephala) in the coelomic cavity, musculature, lungs, and air sacs of ratites is, however, mostly incidental. Attempted antifilarial treatment may be detrimental because of the immune response to the dead parasites.53\nSyngamus trachea and Cyathostoma variegatum have been found in apparently healthy ratites, but high parasitic burden and accompanying stressors may lead to respiratory clinical signs, especially in juvenile birds.36, 52, 53 Fatal cerebral nematodiasis caused by Baylisascaris procyonis and Chandlerella quiscalis larvae migrans are primarily reported in emus and ostriches but also occasionally in other ratites in North America. Songbirds are the reservoir for C. quiscalis, and the parasite is transmitted by Culicoides mosquitoes, whereas B. procyonis is harbored by raccoons and directly transmitted from raccoon latrines near ratite enclosures. Prophylaxis with oral ivermectin, fenbendazole, or pyrantel tartrate is recommended in endemic areas.10, 15, 53\n",

            "text": "Deformities of legs are identified as one of the most important constraints to farm ostrich production but also happen in other ratites. Tibiotarsal rotation, rolled toes, slipped tendons, and bowed legs appear at different stages of growth, and the multiple etiologic factors include protein content of feed and other nutritional factors (minerals, trace elements), trauma, flooring (pen design), inadequate exercise, availability of water, and genetic predisposition. Rolled toes happen by medial displacement of the toe pad and happen most frequently in chicks less than 2 weeks of age. Vitamin B deficiency was hypothesized on the basis of \u201ccurled toe paralysis\u201d syndrome in poultry, but the pathogenesis differs. Splinting and trimming nails work in most cases, but often spontaneous resolution also occurs by the age of 4 weeks. Tibiotarsal rotation and bowed tarsometatarsal bones occur in 2-week to 6-month-old chicks and may be caused by an inappropriate diet (high protein; excessive vitamin supplementation; deficiencies of calcium, manganese, and niacin), and rapid early growth rates. Slipped tendon corresponds to lateral displacement of the gastocnemius tendon of the tibiotarsometatarsal joint mostly in older chicks or the Achilles tendon medially over the tarsometatarsophalangeal joint in younger birds, often because of abrupt movement (\u201cwaltzing\u201d). Similarities to perosis in poultry because of magnesium deficiency have not been proven.18, 41, 44, 53\n",

Impaction of the proventriculus with foreign body material because of abnormal compensatory picking (disorientation stress, desertion stress, or frustration with regard to finding food from change of location or diet), with or without stasis of the ventriculus with accumulation of natural substrates, and koilin hypertrophy frequently occur simultaneously, and the clinical signs and treatment are identical. Clinical signs are nonspecific (loss of appetite, lethargy, weight loss, dehydration, scant defecation), and successful treatment depends on early recognition of the syndrome; regular weight checks, serial contrast radiographic examinations, and auscultation and palpation of the left cranial quadrant after withholding food for 12 hours are the helpful measures.18, 44, 46, 53 If impaction is suspected, medical treatment may be tried with high-energy liquid (vegetable oil), gastric lavage and emulcents and laxatives, metoclopramide, and systemic antibiotics.3 However, if no improvement is seen in over 24 hours or presence of foreign bodies is confirmed radiologically, surgical intervention (proventriculotomy) is mandatory and has a good prognosis if attempted early. As birds mimic each other's behavior, all birds must be checked if one bird is affected.33, 52\n",

            "text": "Differences in reproduction between the five ratite species are listed in Table 9-1.18, 19 Male ostriches sexually mature at 4 to 5 years of age and the hens slightly earlier, and they remain reproductive for up to 40 years. Their sexual activity is seasonal and associated with the photoperiod, rainfall, and availability of food. Males become territorial during the breeding season and display an impressive courtship behavior. Territorial males dig shallow nest scrapes, in which several visiting females contribute eggs to a communal clutch, leading to multiple maternity and paternity in one clutch, but only the \u201cmajor\u201d female and the resident territorial male provide incubation and parental care. More eggs (40\u201360) are laid in the nest than may be incubated, and the major female ejects surplus eggs from the incubated central clutch of approximately 20. Incubation is carried out by both genders, with the male bird mostly sitting during the night. Hatching in the nest occurs after average incubation duration of 42 to 43 days and over 4 to 5 days. Parental care is provided by both parents, and chicks are abandoned at the age of 1 year.18, 19, 53 Ostrich eggs are unusual for their large size and low shell conductance, which makes them prone to insufficient water loss and results in edematous and malpositioned chicks.18 The ostrich has been farmed for over 100 years, and the production has gained global importance in the past few decades. The main constraints of the ostrich production are high rate of infertility, low hatchability, and post-hatch problems such as leg deformities and fading chick syndrome.18, 53 As a consequence, a wealth of literature on ostrich production is available, and the reader is referred to it. Briefly, artificial incubation protocols consist of preincubation storage of the eggs at approximately 20\u00b0 C for 7 to 10 days, incubation at temperatures of 36\u00b0 C to 36.5\u00b0 C and comparably low humidity at 20% to 25% to reach 8% to 18% loss of egg weight until pipping. Vertical position of the eggs during incubation appears beneficial, and frequent turning of the eggs is crucial.16, 53 Sperm collection and artificial insemination have been attempted but are not commonly practiced.42\n",

The close relationship between ratites and tinamous is reflected in similarities in bone structures (especially the palate), eggshell structure, and thermoregulatory and metabolic physiology. The subfamily Tinaminae (forest tinamous) includes 29 species, which are primarily found in tropical and subtropical forests and are differentiated from the second subfamily Rhynchotinae (steppe tinamous, 18 grassland species) by the presence of nostrils in the distal half of the bill. Tinamous are shy and elusive birds and good runners when startled. Their diet is extremely variable and opportunistic, including plant material (fruit, seeds, leaves, flowers, roots), invertebrates, and small vertebrates. Forest dwelling species generally have a larger part of fruit in their diet, whereas grassland species take a greater proportion of seeds.19, 34\n",

The tail is rudimentary and useless for steering, so flight cannot be kept up for long distances and does not appear particularly coordinated. Tinamous feathers have a unique structure, with the barbules being joined together in a solid mass and producing a whistling noise during flight. Feathers on the back and rump are easily shed as a defensive measure. Unlike Struthioniformes, tinamous have highly developed powder-downs for waterproofing the feathers. Females of some species are more brightly colored than males and are heavier. Tinamous have three forward facing toes and one absent or rudimentary hind-toe, and some species may be differentiated by the colors of the tarsi.19\n",
