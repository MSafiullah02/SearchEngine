The type of target assayed forms the basis behind the classification of the wide varieties of microfluidic systems encountered. However, irrespective of the actual target assayed for, the microfluidic systems have to overcome twin problems: that of low pathogen concentration and/or the presence of interferents. Hence various strategies, such as culturing, filtration, electro-kinetic separation, magnetic separation, enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), polymerase chain reaction (PCR), etc., are used to amplify and/or isolate the target pathogen prior to detection. Detection is accomplished using optical, electrical and mechanical techniques (or a combination of them).

            "text": "Infectious pathogens have posed a considerable threat to global health throughout history. Such pathogens are responsible for the black death (caused by Yersinia pestis) of the fourteenth century and the influenza pandemic that occurred between 1918 and 1920, each of which claimed more than 50 million lives [1] [2] [3] . More recently, the acquired immunodefi- More than 50 new, or newly discovered, pathogens have been identified over the past 30 years [1] . In addition to these new discoveries, there exists the constant threat of re-emerging pathogens, which often occur throughout new or extended geographic regions. West Nile fever is one infectious disease that has recently (1999) made a reappearance within a new geographical location, the United States [4] . This disease is the result of a flavivirus transmitted via mosquitoes. Bioterrorism and the growing phenomenon of antimicrobial resistance further compound the difficulties posed by infectious pathogens. One familiar example of a bioterrorist attack took place in 2001 with the mailing of letters filled with anthrax spores that ultimately claimed the lives of 5 people and caused illness in 13 others [6] . The issue of antibiotic resistance is not necessarily new, but, is growing for a variety of reasons, including the inappropriate utilization of antimicrobials [7, 8] . Infectious pathogens that have developed antimicrobial resistant strains over the last several years include pneumococci, enterococci, staphylococci, Plasmodium falciparum, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis [5] . As can be seen from Figure 9 .1, the prevalence of infectious diseases is a global phenomenon. It is estimated that approximately 25% (15 million of 57 million) of annual worldwide deaths are directly attributable to infectious diseases [2] . The toll of these diseases is much greater in the developing world than it is within the developed world [9] , with at least half of all deaths being caused by infectious pathogens [10] . However, even within developed countries, microbial pathogens are not a trivial public health issue. An appreciation of their significance can be gained by examining relevant sepsis statistics. Sepsis is a condition that occurs when toxinproducing bacteria, and other pathogens, infect the bloodstream. These pathogenic organisms are often introduced into the blood stream via infected organs, such as the kidneys (upper urinary tract infection) and the lungs (bacterial pneumonia), or during a hospital stay via various routes (e.g. intravenous lines, surgical wounds, surgical drains, and open-skin wounds like bedsores). Although it does not attract much publicity, sepsis is one of the leading causes of death in the US, with an estimated 750,000 people annually developing severe sepsis and over 215,000 (close to 30%) of those people succumbing to the infection [11] . Within the US, sepsis claims more lives annually than myocardial infraction [12] , lung cancer, or breast cancer [13] . Perhaps a greater cause of concern is that, unlike most other leading causes of death, the fatality rate associated with sepsis has not decreased significantly over the last few decades [14] . Prevention and early detection leading to prompt treatment are essential since minor infections can rapidly turn life threatening [15] . Multiple studies have shown that the earlier bacteria can be detected within the bloodstream and the appropriate antibiotic can be delivered, the more successful the treatment is in fighting off the infection [16] [17] [18] . Diagnostic systems therefore play an integral role in facilitating an effective response to be provided against these infections.",

This method was first popularized by Robert Koch in the last quarter of the 19 th Century, and is still extensively used today with only minor modifications. The standard procedure is to dilute the available sample serially over a few orders of magnitude and to spread approximately 0.1 ml of each of these serially diluted sub-samples uniformly over the surface of a petridish (usually 3-4 inches in diameter) containing a bed of agar gel. This gel contains nutrients that support the growth of microorganisms. Once the liquid suspension is spread out, bacteria in the (sub)sample adhere to the agar gel. The plates are then kept at a temperature favoring growth (typically 37\u00baC), and after an incubation period during which bacteria on the agar proliferate, bacterial colonies that can be visually observed are formed (assuming the initial presence of target bacteria). The number of colonies established is then counted. For a limited range of dilutions of the original sample, it is possible to distinguish individual colonies, and these counts are used to establish the concentration of bacteria in the original sample.",

            "text": "The plate-culture technique is relatively simple and provides a snapshot of the number of bacteria in the original sample at the time that it was collected. However, it does have a number of drawbacks. To begin with, the plating technique utilizes a significant amount of material, is tedious, labor intensive, and takes a long time to provide results (depending on the species and the medium, the time required may range from overnight, to days, or to weeks). The process becomes even more labor intensive if one seeks to screen a sample for multiple bacteria. In this case, multiple petridishes are required and selective media (a medium that supports the growth of only a limited class of bacteria, sometimes even just a single species) have to be designed for each of the target pathogens. Given that in many cases it is not possible to design growth media that are selective for all the individual targets, differences in colony morphology have to be relied upon in order to distinguish different targets and obtain an estimate of their concentrations in the sample. Unfortunately, identifying bacteria based on colony morphology requires very specialized training, and the readings obtained are subject to errors in observer judgment. A more subtle drawback is that the blend of nutrients present in the agar gel may not support the growth and colony formation of all the different types of bacteria present in the (sub)sample spread on the plate. It is also possible that different types of bacteria present may grow/proliferate at very different rates on the agar. It is likely that non-growing or slow-growing bacteria may not be seen, in which case they will not be considered. For many applications, this is a significant limitation. For instance, it is believed that a large fraction of microbes residing in the intestines of humans and other mammals, whose absolute and relative numbers have clinical significance, have never been cultured on plates [20] .",

In addition, these low numbers of bacteria need to be detected in the presence of blood cells, of which there are millions per milliliter. Microfluidic diagnostic systems thus have to deal with two distinct, but inter-related problems, increasing the concentration of the target pathogen cells (in absolute terms and/or with respect to that of the other cells) and detecting/quantifying their presence. The easiest way to approach this overall problem is to tackle these two challenges individually. First, isolate the target cells and second, devise a platform for detection and quantification. It is expected that during this isolation process, not only will the absolute concentration of targets increase, but that interfering species will be discarded as well.",

Antibodies are proteins synthesized by the immune system of animals (including humans) as a targeted response to an infection by a foreign body or pathogen (typically referred to as an antigen). The conformation of these proteins is such that they bind to specific proteins on the surfaces of the invading pathogens. Since different strains of pathogens often exhibit different proteins on their surfaces, it is possible to generate antibodies that are strain specific --such as those developed for Escherichia coli (E. coli) O157:H7, a particularly virulent strain of E. coli [23] . It is also of importance that only a small part of the antibody molecule actually binds to the target antigen. The other end of the molecule, the terminal end, can be chemically modified and immobilized on to a wide variety of surfaces like glass or silica (silicon wafers with a thin oxide layer or glass) [24] , polymers such as acrylates [25] , phthalates [26] , polyethylene [27] , and metals such as gold [28] .

This also serves to facilitate the transport of oxygen and nutrients to the surface of the cell, and prevents toxic wastes excreted by the cells from building up near their immediate vicinity. Additionally, the cultures are usually maintained at a constant temperature (typically 37\u00baC) by housing the growth vessels within incubators. Achieving similar local flow regimes and temperature profiles around proliferating cells maintained within reactors at volumes on the order of micro-liters is a non-trivial task. To resolve these challenges, microfluidic valves, mixers, and heaters have to be incorporated to culture the cells [31] [32] [33] [34] . Additionally, sensors to measure and regulate temperature, dissolved oxygen concentration, and pH within the micro-reactor have to be developed and integrated. One such microreactor is shown in Figure 9 .2. Additional challenges in micro-reactor development include considerations relating to the volume, scales, and fabrication materials typically encountered in microfluidic systems. For instance, polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), a material commonly employed in biomicrofluidic systems, is permeable to air. This material property may lead to sample losses due to evaporation [35] . While the rate may be low (micro-liters per hour or lower), the sample losses cannot be neglected when the operation volume is on the order of micro-liters and the reactor is to be maintained for hours.",

Another issue of concern involves the use of a single micro-reactor for culturing multiple samples, which may be required depending on the cost of the microreactor. Under these circumstances, the formation of biofilms can be problematic. Biofilms are formed when bacteria and other microorganisms adhere to solid surfaces in contact with water and secrete a complex polymeric substance that both anchors them to the solid surface and protects them from bacteriocidal substances in the water [38] . Such biofilms will intermittently shed cells housed within them, which can lead to contamination of the samples being cultured. Biofilms are also difficult to get rid of due to the nature of the polymer matrix in which the microbial cells are housed. The challenges associated with biofilm formation are much more acute in microfluidic systems due to the high surface area to volume ratios encountered [39] , and consequently using disposable systems is preferred. If for some reason a disposable system cannot be employed, complex bioreactor designs may be required to avoid biofilm formation. One such design involves the continuous transport of small, isolated volumes within a micro-channel loop [40] .",

The sample suspension being investigated is allowed to pass through a filter whose pore size is smaller than that of the target, resulting in the target pathogen being retained in the excluded filter cake (retentate). The retentate may then be resuspended in a volume of liquid much smaller (1/10 th or even less) than the original sample. At the macroscale, filtration is more commonly employed for applications like environmental monitoring and food safety, where large sample volumes (1L or larger) and low bacterial loads (~1 CFU / 100 ml or lower) are commonly encountered. On the other hand, clinical samples are typically much smaller. Given the limited aliquot size that can be introduced into a microfluidic device, the use of filtration at the micro-scale may also be necessitated. For example, consider the case of a liquid clinical sample with a bacterial concentration of 100 CFU/ml. If the aliquot size to be employed within the microfluidic device is 100 \u03bcl, then it can be expected that the aliquot will contain 10 CFU on average. However, if the aliquot size is further reduced to 10 \u03bcl, then the average colony count within an aliquot will only be 1 CFU, meaning there is a significant chance that the aliquot drawn will contain no bacteria (even though it was present within the original sample suspension). The ability to concentrate the bacteria from the original sample suspension through filtration would thus be beneficial in preventing false negative test results.",

In this case, the material trapped between the two filters is likely to contain a higher concentration of target particles. It is still possible that a rapid buildup of filter cake on the upstream filter could occur, however, the use of cross-flow and electrokinetic stirring [52] can be employed to remove the cake.",

An example of a cell that exhibits magnetic susceptibility is the red blood cell. Deoxygenated red blood cells are the most paramagnetic cell within the body as a result of the free electrons associated with the iron atom contained within the heme ring of hemoglobin. A continuous separation of red blood cells from whole blood has been achieved in a microfluidic system by placing a small ferromagnetic wire along the length of a microchannel and applying a uniform external magnetic field to create a high gradient magnetic field locally [55] .",

Consequently magnetic particles with the capability of selectively binding to the target pathogen must be employed, and there exist many examples of their use within the literature [56] [57] [58] [59] . Such particles are advantageous for a variety of reasons, including that they offer a considerable surface area for pathogen capture, and that magnetic handling is generally not impacted by changes in pH, temperature, etc. [60] . Magnetic particles are typically composed of an interior magnetic core and an outside shell that can be made of substances ranging from polystyrene to silica to polysaccharide. The idea fundamental to the use of magnetic particles is that some form of interaction between the particle and the pathogen can be created. One prominent example relies upon the conjugation of antibodies specific to a given pathogen onto the surface of the magnetic particle. After the introduction of a sample containing the target pathogen, this pathogen will bind to the conjugated capture antibodies while other substances within the sample should remain unattached. This specific technique was employed by Lien et al in an effort to isolate Dengue virus serotype 2 and enterovirus 7 [58] . This isolation employed Dynabeads \u00ae (Dynal Biotech, Norway), which are hydrophobic superparamagnetic polystyrene beads of approximately 4.5 \u03bcm in diameter. After allowing for the target virus pathogen to bind to its respective antibody on the surface of the beads, the beads were then isolated via a magnetic field created using an integrated magnet of microcoils. While holding the beads in place, the remaining suspension could be flushed from the region, allowing for the isolation and concentration of target pathogen.",

These technologies rely on both the surface charge and the dielectric properties of bacterial cell membranes to isolate the pathogen target from the matrix or suspension in which they are dispersed. Electrophoresis refers to the migration of charged particles suspended in a fluid down the potential gradient of an externally applied electric field. Typically, particles, which are broadly defined here to include both biological cells and macromolecules such as proteins and nucleic acids, migrate with a constant velocity that arises when the viscous drag forces on them equal that of the coulombic forces propelling them down their potential gradients. The velocity of the particle per unit field gradient is referred to as its \"electrophoretic mobility\". The net charge that the particle carries can be a function of the pH of the solution (most proteins and many cells have a net positive charge at low pH and a net negative charge at high pH), and the pH value at which the particle carries no net charge is referred to as its isoelectric point (pI). Particles with different electrophoretic properties can be separated from each other using various schemes, yielding different techniques such as \"field flow fractionation\", \"zone electrophoresis\", \"isoelectric focusing\", etc. that have been described elsewhere [66, 67] . It has also been known for some time that when suspended in common buffers, bacteria of different species have different electrophoretic mobilities, and that their isoelectric points are also different [68] . These differences have been attributed to variations in the surface composition (surface charge density) between the different species/strains of bacteria [69] . Such differences in the electrophoretic behavior of cells have been extensively used at the macro-scale to separate various types of biological cells from each other and from non-biological material [70] .",

Due to the electrophoretic velocity of the seperands relative to the buffer, the seperands elute at a dif-ferent time than when they would have had they flowed along with the buffer. By definition, CE is a \"microfluidic\" technique. Though traditionally performed within specially constructed capillaries, it can also be performed within channels housed in microfluidic chips [71] . The narrow dimension of the capillary (or micro-channel) plays a key role in the success of the technique by preventing the development of recirculation vortices that tend to arise due to temperature differences generated by the joule heating of the ionic current through the system. The Grashof Number, which gives the ratio of buoyancy forces to viscous forces on a fluid element, predicts the formation of natural convection vortices, and scales as the cube of the characteristic length. Consequently, reducing the characteristic length of the system suppresses natural convection that is driven by temperature induced density differences. The high surface area to volume ratio within a microfluidic device also enables relatively rapid heat transfer between the capillary interior and the ambient, thereby further preventing the onset of natural convection.",

Another significant disadvantage with CE stems from the fact that extremely high voltages (kilo-Volts) must be used to drive the electro-osmotic flow (EOF) through the capillaries. This high voltage requirement not only necessitates the use of bulky (and dangerous) high voltage supply units, but also produces extensive electrolysis (gas bubbles). Special provisions must then be included within the device to allow for the escape of air [78] , while also compensating for the fact that if air bubbles do enter a micro-channel or capillary, then EOF alone may not be sufficient for displacing the bubbles within the conduit [79] .",

In contrast to DC, within AC the polarity of the electrodes changes once every halfcycle of the AC signal. If frequencies higher than ~10 kHz are used, the half-cycle time period is shorter than the charge transfer time at the electrode for most electro-chemical reactions, and consequently most Faradaic reactions, which produce air bubbles, are suppressed [80, 81] . In characterizing DEP, it is convenient to consider it the AC analog of electrophoresis. DEP is a process in which migration of suspended particles (not necessarily charged) occurs in the presence of an electric field gradient, either towards or away from regions of high electric field strength. The migration of a particle towards a high-field region is termed positive DEP, while the opposite is known as negative DEP. Whether the particle experiences positive or negative DEP is determined by the sign of the Claussius-Mossotti factor, a complex term that depends on the values of the conductivity and dielectric constants (permittivity) of the particle and the suspending medium [82] .",

However, for frequencies that can be practically realized, ~10 kHz to 100 MHz (high enough not to generate bubbles, but low enough to not require expensive equipment), DEP behavior depends in a complex manner on both of these quantities. Qualitatively though, the effect of conductivity is more pronounced at lower frequencies and that of permittivity at higher frequencies. In standard buffers, such as phosphate buffered saline (PBS), both the conductivity and the permittivity of bacterial cells are typically lower than that of the medium. Consequently, bacterial cells generally do not display any cross-over from negative to positive DEP (have negative DEP for all frequencies). However, when these cells are placed in low conductivity suspensions (~100 mS/cm), they display positive DEP at lower frequencies and cross-over to negative DEP in the range of 100 KHz to 100 MHz [83] . Since dielectrophoretic phenomena rely on field-induced dielectric polarization at the cell membrane, and the composition and properties of the membrane vary from species to species, the cross-over frequency (the particular frequency at which the DEP behavior changes from positive to negative) is generally a function of the species and strain of the cell [84] . Thus, there can exist certain frequencies where the DEP behavior of target cells is different from that of other cells (and non cellu-lar impurities in the system), allowing for the isolation of the target cells from complex suspensions containing many other species [85] [86] [87] [88] . However, it must be considered that prolonged storage, or other sample handling processes that impact the physical composition of the membrane can change the cross-over frequency of the target cell [89, 90] .",

            "text": "Perhaps the main disadvantage associated with DEP is that typical obtainable particle velocities are low. It can be shown that the DEP force on a particle scales to the third power of the particle radius and quadratically with the applied voltage. This cubic dependence on particle radius in conjunction with practical limitations on the applied voltage render the particle velocity produced by a DEP force miniscule, typically on the order of 10 \u03bcm/sec for bacteria and 1 \u03bcm/sec for viruses. Concentration times on the orders of hours are thus required. Also problematic is the fact that the field gradient necessary to drive DEP motion can only be achieved with relatively narrow inter-digitated electrodes, whose field penetration depth is limited by the electrode width. As a result, DEP channels are usually less than 50 microns in transverse dimension. The slow capture and the small transverse dimension produce extremely low throughputs for continuous flow kits. For example, for a 5 cm-long device employing a 50 micron transverse dimension and a 10 micron/s DEP velocity, pathogen capture can only be ensured if the throughput is less than 25 nanoliters per second. At this flowrate, it would require more than 10 hours to process a 1 ml sample. This low throughput and batch volume can be somewhat alleviated with a massively parallel array for laboratory use, but such arrays cannot be easily designed for a miniature and portable diagnostic kit.",

            "text": "Bacteria isolation and concentration by DEP can be sped-up by using fluidic forces (convection) to transport suspended particles (of all types, including the target pathogen) to a specific localized region, and then capturing the targets utilizing DEP forces. This basic idea has been extensively applied in a variety of manners to capture different targets by the corresponding author of this review and collaborators. This can be accomplished by generating converging flows with stagnation points, and imposing the electric field gradient on the particles at the electrode stagnation points (or lines) where the viscous drag is weakest. In such systems, while all suspended particles are swept towards the stagnation point along with the fluid flow, only particles (such as the target pathogen) that are directed by the electric field (due to positive or negative DEP) towards the stagnation points are captured. Converging flows of this nature have been generated by AC EOF at symmetric electrodes [91] , by AC EOF generated with serpentine coils [92] , by rotational vortices generated using an ionic wind [93] , and by a combination of DC bias and circulatory AC EOF [94] . It is possible to generate fluidic velocities of approximately 10 mm/s, which represents a thousand-fold increase in the speed at which target particles move towards the collection zone compared to simple DEP. Once collected at a \"point\" (a volume of a few pico-liters), the pathogens can then be detected via a variety of detection mechanisms. The rapid dielectrophoretic isolation and/or concentration of pathogens within continuous flow-through systems has been accomplished utilizing methods such as integrated \"3-dimensional\" (3D) electrodes. Such designs employ aligned electrode pairs fabricated either along the sidewalls [96] or on the top and bottom [97, 98] of channels through which the particleladen fluid flows. This 3D configuration produces a high field normal to the flow direction and penetrates across the entire height of the channel. Therefore, bacteria present through the entire depth of the channel (as opposed to just those near the bottom, as is the case for single electrode devices) can be deflected and/or captured while liquid flows unimpeded. Through tailoring the orientation of the 3D electrode, the particles can be directed to different streamlines/exits, or can be prevented from flowing past a point in the channel altogether, creating a DEP force field cage through which particles can not pass [99] [100] [101] [102] . DEP fields from 3D electrodes have been exploited to generate a continuous sorting and trapping device, which is shown in Figure 9 .3, that is capable of sorting and collecting three different types of pathogens at a rate of ~300 particles/sec [95] . The unique physical and electrical properties of nano-particles, such as carbon nano-tubes (CNTs), can also be harnessed to isolate target species dispersed in the sample. Due to their ability to store charge and their long, narrow geometry, very strong dipoles are induced by exposing CNTs to a high frequency AC field. This focused field, especially at the tips of the CNTs, leads to high field gradients, which serve to attract pathogen particles to the CNTs by DEP. CNTs may be embedded onto the \"floor\" of the micro-channel [104] , or may be deliberately dispersed into the pathogen containing suspension [103] . In the latter case, on average the CNTs are closer to the target pathogens. Additionally, at lower AC frequencies, CNTs are themselves attracted to electrodes embedded within the microfluidic device. Their cylindrical geometry confers upon them a much higher DEP mobility than is typically observed for spherical or ellipsoidal pathogens. Consequently, suspension dispersed CNTs will drag along the surface of embedded electrodes as they flow through a micro-channel, thereby bringing trapped pathogens to the electrode surface. This approach, as illustrated in Figure 9 .4, has been successfully utilized to enhance the trapping rate of target pathogens by a factor estimated to be over 1000.",

First, particles other than the target may get deposited or adhere non-specifically to the surfaces being monitored, thereby yielding misleading results. Second, the targets may take a long time to diffuse to the surface, thereby degrading the performance of the system. This latter problem can be overcome by coupling the detection system to the systems described above for isolating the targets [109] .",

            "text": "Another potential approach is to use a specific property of the pathogens that enable them to provide a unique and recognizable signature. One such property that can be exploited is the ability of bacteria to store charge. Direct measurements [110] of the amount of charge in an individual bacte-rium (~10 -13 Coulombs) and their zeta potential (~20 mV) suggest that an individual bacterium, if considered a solid sphere of radius 1 \u03bcm, has an effective dielectric constant of ~10,000. This remarkably high number probably arises due to the presence of proteins (such as those forming the various ion channels and regulators) that are extremely efficient in capturing electrons. In contrast, the dielectric constant of aqueous solutions is typically about 80, and so the presence of even a few bacteria should greatly alter the dielectric constant of the solution. Unfortunately, the \"double layer\" capacitance at the electrode solution interface effectively screens this bacterial capacitance that is dispersed in the bulk solution, especially when operating at frequencies below 1 MHz [111] . However, by modulating the geometry and positioning of the electrodes in a manner that increases the bulk resistance (R), and hence increases the RC time of the medium, the measured reactance (\"imaginary\" or \"out-of-phase\" component of the measured impedance) can be made sensitive to bulk capacitance. Consequently signatures of bacterial presence and proliferation at concentrations low enough (100-1000 CFU/ml) to be applicable to many \"real world\" problems have been detected [112] .",

Fluorescence is popular due to its high sensitivity, allowing for single molecule detection [132, 133] , high selectivity, and easy integration of fluorescent tags within the microfluidic system. The joining of fluorescence-based detection platforms with on-chip assay and separation schemes has become prevalent. For instance, Xiang et al. produced an immunoassay device that was capable of detecting E.coli O157:H7 at a limit of detection of 0.3 ng/\u03bcl [127] . A membrane-based immunoassay system was developed by Floriano et al. that incorporated fluorescent detection of Bacillus globigii at a detection limit of as little as 500 spores [128] . Realtime PCR chips that employ fluorescent detection schemes have been developed for the amplification of hepatitis B virus [130] and E. coli O157:H7 stx1 [131] . Electrophoretic separation of PCR amplicons and subsequent fluorescent identification has been demonstrated for the detection of E.coli O157:H7 and Salmonella typhimurium at a starting concentration of as low as 6 copies of target DNA [116] .",

Efforts to miniaturize optical detection platforms are currently underway, and are discussed in detail elsewhere [120, 126] . Light emitting diodes (LEDs) coupled with optical filters and silicon photodiodes offer the potential for developing a miniaturized optical detection platform [134] .

There are three key components of a typical flow cytometer, the first being a fluidic mechanism that causes all of the particles in a suspension to line up in a single file as they flow down a channel. The second key component is a set of detectors (such as lasers of different wavelengths) that can probe individual particles, along with the fluid stream, flowing past the detector and obtain information (such as whether a given cell has taken up a particular fluorescent dye) that indicates one or more specific properties of the cell. This information, along with the known velocity of the particle traveling down the channel, can then be taken advantage of by the third key component of the flow cytometer to steer target particles/cells to specific downstream collection chamber(s), while the remaining particles are discarded. Although conventional state-of the-art flow cytometers can measure and subsequently sort particles based on a combination of as many as ten parameters [136] and/or achieve throughputs as high as ~10,000 cells per second [137] , they do suffer from a number of drawbacks. Besides requiring expert operators, they also require large volumes of sheath fluid (~1 L of sheath fluid per 1 ml of sample) and high performance pumping systems to operate, thereby making them non-portable and prohibitively expensive for routine diagnostic procedures in the clinical setting.",

An excellent review of microfluidic flow cytometry has been provided by Huh et al. [138] . These research efforts, along with others directed towards developing microfluidic pumps, valves and other peripherals [139] [140] [141] , have already yielded commercial bench-top flow cytometers, such as the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer\u00ae (Agilent Inc.), the Cyflow\u00ae ML (Partec GmbH) and the Mycrocytometer\u00ae System (Micronics Inc.). While these systems, like their macroscale counterparts, are primarily designed for mammalian cells, they have also been employed by some researchers to quantify bacteria [142, 143] . This is a difficult task though as bacterial cells are typically 10-100 times smaller than mammalian cells, making them difficult to confine to a single file in a fluid stream, and thus providing unsatisfactory results. Consequently, there have also been efforts to develop cytometers specifically for bacterial cells [143] [144] [145] .",

The weight of the beam (when subjected to gravitational forces) and external forces, if any, flexes the beam. The beam's elasticity, in turn, attempts to restore it to its original shape, thus leading the system to have a characteristic natural frequency of vibration. This frequency, known as the principle resonant frequency, is a function of the effective mass and the spring constant of the beam. Therefore, when the effective mass of the beam in-creases due to the adhesion of particles (like bacteria) to it, the vibration of the beam is dampened, and the principle resonant frequency decreases [147] . This effect is utilized to detect the presence of bacteria of interest in many microfluidic systems. Typically, antibodies specific to the target pathogen are immobilized on the cantilever, either by physical adsorption [148] or chemically [149] , prior to exposing the system to the sample of interest. Ideally, washing with plain buffer removes all particles adhering non-specifically to the cantilever, and the resonant frequency can subsequently be measured. This is typically accomplished through an external instrument, such as an \"optical lever\" or interferometer, or through changes in the piezoelectric resistance or capacitance of the beam as measured via internally embedded circuit elements [150] . The change in the resonant frequency from its value prior to the introduction of the sample of interest is related to the amount (mass) of bacteria adhering to the cantilever, thereby also allowing for a quick quantification of the target species as well.",

However, coating multiple antibodies on adjacent micro-cantilevers is a complex task, requiring multiple surface treatment steps (one for each type of antibody being coated/immobilized). Furthermore, this process is made more difficult by problems of \"stiction\" (fluid remaining stuck underneath the cantilever due to surface tension), that require special treatment procedures like freeze-drying [155] , \"critical point drying\" [156] , application of laser pulses [157] , etc. after each step involving a different solution.",

Flow and mixing of the sample solution can give rise to shear forces that bend (and may even break) them. Non-specific adsorption of random species from the sample and electrochemical reactions can change the mass of the cantilever. Moreover, only some of these effects may be corrected for using a reference (control) cantilever in addition to the sensing cantilever. In addition to sharing the problems associated with non-specific adhesion with most antibody-based systems, having their antibodies anchored to a nondispersed surface also requires that the targets have to diffuse to the surface (thereby requiring a long time with solutions having low counts of the target species). Thus, while they have been used in the laboratory to detect bacteria suspended at reasonably high concentrations (10 6 / ml and above) in buffers [148, 151] , such cantilever based systems may not have the degree of ruggedness that will be required to handle a large number of real world samples.",

This changes the properties, like pH, dissolved concentration of gasses (oxygen and carbon-dioxide), and electrical conductivity, of the suspending medium. If an appreciable change is detected in these properties, it is taken to imply that pathogens are present that are causing the observed change. A generic growth medium (such as Tryptic Soy Broth, Luria Broth, or Beef Broth) supports the growth of multiple pathogenic and non-pathogenic microbes. Therefore, the use of such media only allows the determination that there exist some viable cells within the sample of interest. That being said, however; selective media can be designed that supports the growth of a limited number of pathogens, typically being those from the same genus. For instance, the Cornell Modified Growth Medium supports the growth of Mycobacteria (a slow growing class of bacteria whose members include the organism causing tuberculosis in humans) while suppressing the growth of other microorganisms [158] . The elapsed time prior to detection (of a specified change in medium properties) can be used to predict the initial pathogen load. This is fairly intuitive given that the greater the initial number of microorganisms in the sample, the higher will be the overall rate of metabolism occurring within the sample, and the faster a detectable change in medium properties will occur. The initial load against elapsed time to detection (TTD) calibration for a particular system (device-medium-organism) can be obtained relatively easily. These methods span a variety of techniques, from those based on detecting the activity of a specific enzyme [159] , the release of a specific metabolite like carbon dioxide (radio-labeled [160] or otherwise [161] ), looking for an increase in the electrical conductivity [162] , a change in the pH (typically observable as a color change within most culturing medium) [163] , or finally a change in the oxygen tension of the medium as a whole [164] .",

            "text": "A large number of high throughput, but not necessarily \"microfluidic\" devices rely on this basic principle. These include the Bactec,\u2122 which de-tects the amount of radio-labeled carbon dioxide released; the ESP\u00ae Culture System (TREK Diagnostic Systems), which detects a decrease in oxygen tension; Coli-Check TM swabs, which use Bromocresol Purple as an indicator to measure a decrease in pH due to bacterial metabolism, and the Bactometer\u2122 (Bactomatic Ltd.), Malthus 2000\u2122 (Malthus Instruments Ltd.), and RABIT\u2122 (Don Whitley Scientific Ltd.) systems that each use electrical impedance. These devices are typically designed to handle samples of ~1-10 ml, and are used for a variety of applications, such as environmental water quality testing, food safety, and veterinary and medical diagnostics. As these devices/methods have greatly simplified handling procedures and incorporated many other features (such as automated readouts) that aid in enabling high-throughout operation, they have acquired broad acceptance in the applied microbiology community. However, the common operating principle, monitoring the sample for effects of microbial metabolism, fundamentally limits how quickly these devices can deliver reliable results. In other words, their \"time-to-detection\" is still quite high, often being comparable to that of the traditional plating technique. In some cases, such as when the initial bacterial load is very low (~100 CFU/ml or lower), the automated techniques may actually take more time than the traditional plating technique (in which the TTD is independent of bacterial load). This is because the amount of metabolite processed by an individual bacterium is extremely small. Given that the specific oxygen consumption rate for E. coli has been estimated to be ~20 milli-moles of oxygen per hour per gram (dry weight) of bacteria [165] , and a typical bacterium has a dry weight of ~10 -12 grams [166] , a fairly active individual E. coli bacterium consumes ~2 x 10 -14 moles of oxygen per hour. A typical well-oxygenated sample will have a dissolved oxygen concentration of ~2 x 10 -4 M (2 x 10 -7 moles in 1 ml of sample). If the sample has a moderately low initial concentration of bacteria to begin with (~1000 CFU/ml), then the hourly consumption of oxygen for 1000 bacteria (~2 x 10 -11 moles) represents a 0.01% change in the concentration of dissolved oxygen. Such a change is so small that it is practically undetectable. Given the exponential growth nature of bacteria, a subsequent change in the concentration of the metabolite being monitored of 2-5% in 8-12 hours for E. coli would be expected. At that point, the presence of the original 1000 could be confirmed. However, in this case, the TTD would be comparable to that obtained with the traditional plating technique. Lower initial loads would further increase this TTD, and slower metabolizing/growing bacteria would further stretch the TTD. Consider that the detection times for mycobacteria are typically 10-45 days using such automated techniques [164] .",

Gas sensors [169] and biosensors for specific chemicals [170] have also been incorporated within microfluidic systems for detecting/monitoring bacterial growth and proliferation. Interestingly, when cells are confined to small volumes (on the order of picoliters) and consequently are in close proximity to the electronic sensing elements, it has also been possible to use thermal sensors [171] to record bacterial metabolism. The TTD of the microfluidic versions of the metabolism based detection systems, however, is limited by the same basic principle that stymies their macrofluidic counterparts.",

These assays take advantage of the specificity of formation of an antibody-antigen complex, which is a result of the fact that such antibodies are produced based on a specific antigen. Therefore, in use within a diagnostic assay, a given antibody will remain specific to the antigen for which it was developed. As mentioned above, one of the most fundamental immunoassay techniques is the ELISA. There are several different ELISA types, including direct, competitive, and sandwich formats. The sandwich ELISA will likely be one of the primary immunoassay platforms employed on-chip given that it generally exhibits impressive sensitivity and specificity traits, along with favorable kinetics [176] . This assay, as it is traditionally performed, is presented in Figure  9 .6. Basic schematic (minus the rinsing and blocking steps) for a traditional sandwich ELISA. In the first step (A), a capture antibody specific to the target antigen is attached to the surface of a microwell plate. This is followed with a rinsing step, a blocking step, and an additional rinsing step. Sample solution, containing target antigen, is added next, allowing for the target antigen to bind to the capture antibody (B). After an additional rinsing step, a detection antibody, which is generally covalently bound to an enzyme, is introduced and allowed to selectively bind to the captured target antigen (C). Finally, after a last rinse, a substrate molecule is added and converted into a product molecule via the bound enzyme (D). This product molecule is utilized as a means of detecting and quantifying the target antigen.",

These drawbacks can often lead to inconsistencies in the obtained assay results and are problematic in producing a rapid diagnostic assay that can be utilized for POC healthcare solutions. The development of microfluidic ELISA platforms will likely relieve these stresses. While microfluidic-based ELISA has not received the same attention that nucleic acid based microfluidic technologies have, the trend is beginning to change [182, 183] . Commercial microfluidic immunoassays are beginning to appear, with one example being the Triage\u00ae system developed by Biosite\u00ae Inc.

Microfluidic devices are attractive platforms for immunoassays given that they can alleviate the time and labor difficulties of conventional ELISA as transport is through both diffusion and convection, transport distances are greatly reduced, and the assay can largely (if not completely) be automated. Moreover, such devices have the potential to be fabricated and operated inexpensively, and provide the opportunity to integrate the assay with on-chip sample preparation and target detection, providing a micro-Total Analysis System (\u03bc-TAS).",

One of the key issues involved in localizing an immunoassay to the surface of a microchannel wall is the efficient immobilization of antibody (or protein) to the surface while preventing non-specific protein adsorption that would both interfere with the assay and also reduce the available surface area for target protein immobilization. This issue was discussed in a review written by Lee [190] and has been considered in several publications [176, 185, 191] . In developing a microfluidic immunoassay device for the detection of E. coli O157:H7, Bai et al. functionalized a poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) surface with poly(ethyleneimine) (PEI) to introduce amine groups to the polymer channel walls [191] . This was followed by glutaraldehyde addition to provide aldehyde groups for protein binding. An affinity purified antibody to E. coli O157:H7 cells was then allowed to adsorb to the surface of the channel via the aldehyde groups, followed by the introduction of a sample suspension containing inactivated cells which was allowed to bind to the immobilized antibody. Finally, peroxidase-labeled affinity purified antibody to the cells was added. The peroxidase enzyme catalyzed a substrate to product conversion, producing fluorescence for detection purposes. This surface treatment method improved antibody binding, and compared to untreated PMMA microchannels, an approximately 45 times greater signal and 3 times greater signal/noise ratio was achieved. Additionally, this microchannel device required only 2 minutes for E. coli O157:H7 capture and required a mere 5-8 cells within the initial sample aliquot, both of which are an improvement compared to traditional multiwell plate ELISA.",

However, the use of beads is becoming more commonplace [187] [188] [189] 193] because of inherent advantages, such as an increased available surface area to volume ratio (which in-turn increases the real-estate that can be taken advantage of for protein binding), further reduced antigen-antibody molecular diffusion distance, potential for multiplexing, ease of manipulation, and ease of performing surface chemistry modifications. One specific example of a bead-based microfluidic immunoassay platform was provided by Liu et al. for the detection of a marine iridovirus [187] . In their work, antibody-coated microbeads (~2.89 \u03bcm in diameter) were trapped within a microfluidic channel via an included filter assembly. After incubation with the iridovirus, detection was provided through the insertion of quantum dots attached to the detection antibody. In comparison to a traditional ELISA scheme, this approach was able to detect the marine iridovirus at a significantly improved limit of detection (22 ng/ml as opposed to 360 ng/ml), in a shorter time period (<0.5 hours as opposed to >3.25 hours), and with less demand on the availability of antibodies (0.035 \u03bcg used as opposed to 0.5 \u03bcg).",

The genetic identification of pathogens is dependent upon the presence of sufficient genetic material (i.e. DNA or RNA). However, it is typical that the target pathogen is present at a dilute concentration, complicating detection. To alleviate this difficulty, DNA amplification becomes essential. This is typically achieved through implementation of the PCR, which incorporates three cycled reaction steps: a denaturing step run at 92-96\u00baC, an annealing step run at about 40-65\u00baC, and finally an extension step run at about 72\u00baC.",

One notable advantage specific to microfluidic-based PCR is a decreased time of amplification as a result of low thermal capacities and large heat transfer rates (because of large surface area to volume ratios) [201, 202] . Though the miniaturization of PCR offers several advantages, the first micro-PCR device was not described until 1993 [203] . Currently, microfluidic chip based PCR can operate with reaction volumes of less than 200 nl [204] [205] [206] [207] [208] , and can offer reductions in reaction time through improvements in the on-chip heating and cooling rates. A conventional thermal cycler provides heating and cooling rates of approximately 1-2\u00baC/s, however, a heating rate of 175\u00baC/s and a cooling rate of 125\u00baC/s has now been reported within a microfluidic design [209] . Commercial microfluidic based PCR devices have arisen as well, and have been employed in detecting a variety of pathogens. For instance, Mycobacterium bovis was detected using the GeneXpert \u00ae system produced by Cepheid (Sunnyvale, CA) [210] . Within this system, a filter is employed to capture organisms from a clinical sample, which is then followed by cell lysis. Real-time PCR of the released nucleic acids can then be conducted for pathogen identification. This system is of particular interest as all of these steps, organism isolation, cell lysis, and real-time PCR detection are performed on a single, disposable cartridge. Another example of a commercial microfluidic based PCR device is the BioMark\u2122 48.48 Dynamic Array developed by the Fluidigm \u00ae Corporation (San Francisco, CA). This system is capable of running up to 2304 reactions per chip while only 96 total liquid loading steps are required. The advantages offered by this microfluidic chip, especially the large number of reactions that can be run in parallel, were beneficial to a study aimed at probing individual bacteria within the lignocellulose-decomposing microbial community that exists within wood-feeding termites [211] .",

Another example, E. coli O157:H7, is a food-born pathogen that has been identified as the culprit in several severe human infection outbreaks [227] . This pathogen is particularly dangerous given that a minimal concentration is required for human infection (as low as 10-100 CFU/g) [228] , and that the organism produces many clinical manifestations [229] . It has been estimated that there are 73000 cases and 61 deaths per year within the United States alone that are attributable to this pathogen [230] . Traditional detection protocols, namely identifying the bacteria in stool cultures, can be time-intensive [230, 231] , requiring at least a 16 hour culture period [232] . In view of this limitation, Koh et al. have described a microfluidic device created from poly(cyclic olefin) for the amplification of E. coli O157:H7 and subsequent on-chip detection through electrophoresis and fluorescence identification of amplicons [116] . The static amplification was carried out within a gel-valve isolated reaction chamber with volumes as small as 29 nL using E. coli O157:H7 serotype specific primers. Heating was accomplished using a localized printed ink-based heater that allowed for a heating rate of ~12\u00baC/s. A detection limit of approximately 6 DNA copies present within the initial solution fed to the PCR was determined. Several additional examples of on-chip PCR of E. coli O157:H7 can be found within the literature [233, 234] .",

            "text": "There are several issues that complicate the rapid, microfluidic genomic detection of pathogenic substances. These concerns include low concentrations of biological targets and a typically complex biological sample matrix. Taken in context, there is thus some balance between minimum sample volume, rapid assay time, and detection sensitivity that must be considered in practical device fabrication. Considering this, Yang et al. amplified a DNA segment on-chip directly from an E. coli K12 strain (often referred to as colony PCR) [232] . The polycarbonate device employed a serpentine PCR channel for continuous amplification of volumes as large as 40 \u03bcl, and target DNA was provided through thermal lysis of the E. coli cells. The amplification was carried out using these cells both within and without the company of 2% sheep blood, and amplification from as few as 10 cells was observed. To block potential PCR inhibitors present within the biological sample matrix, the PCR mixture was supplemented with a specific buffer (Q buffer). Another potential means around this is to isolate the target genomic DNA after on-chip lysis. This was accomplished after thermal lysis of E. coli cells through capture onto probe tagged magnetic particles by Yeung et al. [235] . After DNA isolation, asymmetric PCR was performed to produce amplified single strand DNA that was subsequently detected through electrochemical methods. Other examples of microfluidic amplification of target DNA directly from a biological sample can be found within the literature [211, 217, 218, [236] [237] [238] .",

            "text": "There remain many key considerations regarding the miniaturization of PCR that must be resolved. Some of these platform design criteria can be seen in comparing the devices described by Koh et al. [116] and Yeung et al. [235] . This includes the PCR format, which can be static with the PCR mixture held within a reaction chamber while the chamber temperature is cycled through the normal temperature ranges, or continuous with the PCR mixture transported through a channel and different regions of the channel held to appropriate temperatures. Each of these designs present different challenges, such as achieving a rapid and precise temperature control and fluid manipulation. Additional considerations include providing for onchip heating and cooling (typically through either contact or non-contact methods), preventing sample evaporation (which is an increasing problem with a reduction in sample volume), ensuring sufficient sample volume to provide enough starting target DNA, preventing cross-contamination, preventing sample adsorption to surface walls, integrating sample preparation and detection platforms with the PCR on-chip, the material(s) employed for device fabrication, and providing for real-time PCR. As would be expected, the various materials available for construction of microfluidic devices each have different properties that will impact some aspect of the PCR reaction. Thus far, most microfluidic PCR devices have been fabricated utilizing either silicon or glass [116, 202, 239] . Silicon is advantageous for its high thermal conductivity and glass is advantageous because it lends itself well to integration with optical detection schemes. However, the use of these two materials presents specific challenges. For instance, bare silicon is opaque, complicating the integration of optical detection methodologies, and it is known to inhibit the PCR reaction through sample adsorption to the surface wall [239] . As is also the case with silicon chips, glass carries with it a high fabrication cost, preventing the realization of a truly disposable chip. This lack of disposability increases the risk of crosscontamination through multiple uses [226] . A potential means of accounting for cross-contamination involves control of the micro-chamber surfaces. To accomplish this end, Prakash et al. silanized a glass microchamber surface prior to carrying out the PCR reaction [220] . Following the reaction, the silanized surface of the microchamber was removed and a fresh silanization was carried out. In this manner, cross-contamination was controlled by ensuring sample antigen from a previous amplification did not remain on the wall of the microchamber during future amplification reactions. Another attractive solution to the cross-contamination problem involves the use of certain polymer substrates in the construction of microfluidic chips. Polymers, such as polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), are relatively inexpensive, potentially allowing for the realization of a truly disposable chip, which would obviously circumvent the problem of crosscontamination. PDMS is also an attractive material as it provides good optical properties and exhibits limited PCR sample adsorption. Consequently there are several examples of the use of PDMS within microfluidic PCR designs [202, 213, 217, 239] . However, the use of PDMS is not without its own difficulties. One such difficulty is that PDMS is permeable, providing the possibility of sample losses. This problem becomes more significant as sample volume is reduced within a microfluidic chip. To avert this obstacle, the use of a vapor barrier has been suggested [240] . In one report, a polyethylene vapor barrier layer was implanted within the PDMS from which the device was fabricated [240] . Amplification was then carried out on 1.75 \u03bcl of PCR solution, with yeast genomic DNA as the target. The use of the vapor barrier was shown to reduce fluid loss by at least 3-fold, significantly enhancing the amplification. Finally it should not go without mentioning that sample evaporation is not a problem solely confined to polymer-fabricated devices, as this issue must also be considered when re-ducing sample volume within silicone and glass devices. Steps taken to minimize this sample loss include the use of mineral oil [209] and microvalves [241] . Recently, valve-less strategies based on diffusion-limited evaporation mechanisms for reducing sample evaporation were shown to be effective by Wang et al. [242] . To accomplish this aim, long and narrow channels were built into the microchip. As convective airflow is not present within these channels, sample evaporation then becomes limited by the lengthy diffusion time of vapor traversing the long, narrow channel. To supplement this strategy, efforts to decrease the liquid evaporation driving force included thermal isolation and vapor replenishment utilizing water.",

The \"hardware\" aspect of this research is directed at designing better micro-devices (like pumps, sensors, etc.), formulating methods to fabricate these micro-devices in or on materials that are biocompatible (or desirable from some other standpoint), and in devising ways to package these systems and interface them with the outside (macro) world. The \"software\" aspect of this research is directed towards arriving at newer and more effective strategies for isolating and/or detecting target pathogens.",

While these efforts have produced very interesting and encouraging results, the development of a practical and ro-bust device that fulfils the pathogen detection goals laid out in the introduction of this chapter will likely require considerable focus on combining these varied approaches into an integrated microfluidic system. Such a system will conceivably (at least when describing first generation devices) employ a short pre-culture step in order to increase the concentration of detection targets. This step will be followed by relatively simple separation steps (perhaps utilizing phenomena such as DEP), and then the device will end with a sensitive biosensor of some type. In designing this system, it will be important to consider that the optimization of target pathogen detection (i.e. detecting low number of target pathogens with high specificity) might require the operation of the initial device stages (selective amplification and separation) sub-optimally.",

For instance, recent work [246] has uncovered links between periodontal disease and the infestation of gums by archaea (a class of microscopic organism that is believed to have evolved separately from bacteria and other cellular organisms). Periodontal disease, in turn, has been identified as a contributing factor to endocarditis, atherosclerosis, stroke, and preterm delivery of low-birth-weight infants. Unfortunately, little is currently known about the exact mechanisms by which archaea could lead to these complications. Additionally, the protocols for quantifying the presence of such microscale organisms have either not been standardized, or are known only to a few expert researchers. Consequently, diagnostic devices (both micro-and macro-scale) that can successfully detect such microbes have yet to be developed.",

However, recent research has suggested that microbial \"communities\" may in fact either be responsible for and/or contributing towards several aggravating conditions, such as obesity [247] and Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) [248, 249] . In such instances, the relative number, pathogen-host and pathogen-pathogen metabolic interaction, and spatial distribution of the micro-organisms likely determines their resulting impact (regarding both what the impact is and its severity) on the host. All these factors will add up to alter the technical goals required of microfluidic diagnostic devices and place increased demands on their capabilities in the future.",
