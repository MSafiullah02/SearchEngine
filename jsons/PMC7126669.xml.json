LRTI could be excluded by either nonresponse to broad-spectrum antibiotics or at least one bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) testing negative for an extensive panel of known pulmonary pathogens. Transbronchial biopsy was recommended when clinically permissible. Many clinical syndromes were included in this IPS definition, including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute interstitial pneumonitis, delayed pulmonary toxicity syndrome, peri-engraftment respiratory distress syndrome, DAH, cryptogenic organizing pneumonia, and bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome. The working group acknowledged the clinical heterogeneity within this definition and recommended multidisciplinary investigation to improve our understanding of IPS pathobiology and motivate novel treatments.",

Incidence of IPS in these populations that included children and adults was 5.7% after autologous HCT18 and 8% after allogeneic HCT.18, 19 Median time to IPS onset was 21 days, ranging from 7 to 34 days. Risk factors included high-grade GVHD, age, total-body-irradiation (TBI) dose, and transplant indication. Mechanical ventilation was used in 62% to 69% of IPS cases, and mortality rates were approximately 75% in the hospital or within 30 days of discharge.

For example, it is not known how biology varies between IPS subtypes. A recent study by Seo and colleagues45 highlights another important limitation to our understanding of IPS. Using modern molecular diagnostic technologies, the investigators detected occult potential pathogens in 57% of BAL fluid samples taken from clinically diagnosed IPS cases. Patients with occult microorganisms experienced worse outcomes. This study suggests that infection may play unrecognized roles in IPS development, phenotype, or severity. Alternatively, it is possible that clinical research from which the basic understanding of IPS arose was biased because of misclassification of true infectious pneumonia as IPS. Additional research is needed to progress our ability to develop new preventive and therapeutic strategies for IPS.",

The investigators generated and internally validated high-performing models that used varied combinations of peptides to predict the development of IPS and its response to treatment with etanercept, a soluble TNF-\u03b1-binding protein. Several proteins in the acute phase response signaling pathway were selected for inclusion in the prediction models and changed throughout the course of IPS, consistent with dysregulated innate immunity.

In another trial, children receiving etanercept experienced higher rates of survival without supplemental oxygen 28 days after enrollment compared with historical controls.40 Although long-term survival was not studied, 63% of etanercept-treated children remained alive 1 year later, a higher survival rate than seen in prior studies of corticosteroid therapy.

Macrolides suppress production of macrophage-derived cytokines implicated in IPS pathogenesis64 and improve cryptogenic organizing pneumonia in small studies outside HCT settings.65, 66 Macrolides may similarly benefit patients with IPS when administered at doses higher than are commonly used for infection prophylaxis.

Its reported incidence varies widely after allogeneic HCT, whereby neutrophil activation may be a component of acute GVHD.75 In the original description of PERDS after autologous HCT, 32% of 19 patients were mechanically ventilated and 26% died.70 Most severe PERDS cases treated with systemic corticosteroids improved. Whereas ES is associated with transplant-related mortality,71, 75 the better response to corticosteroids and higher survival of PERDS relative to other IPS subtypes highlights the fact that IPS subtypes may have importantly different biology.",

COP typically manifests as a subacute illness characterized by fever, dyspnea, and nonproductive cough. However, the timing and pace of onset of COP varies; its severity ranges from mild to severe respiratory failure.90 The median onset is 108 days after HCT.91 Risk factors include acute and chronic GVHD, female donors for male recipients, and conditioning with combination cyclophosphamide and TBI.91, 92 Radiographs commonly show unilateral or bilateral patchy foci of consolidation and ground-glass opacities with a subpleural, peribronchial, or bandlike pattern (Fig. 5\n).93 Pulmonary function tests show ventilatory restriction and reduced diffusing capacity with or without obstruction. The definitive diagnosis of COP requires surgical lung biopsy; however, a case presenting with typical clinical features and bronchoscopy excluding infectious pneumonia may justify a treatment trial.94 Histologic samples are characterized by patchy proliferation of immature fibroblasts called Masson bodies in a matrix of loose connective tissue involving the terminal airways, alveolar ducts, and alveoli with or without bronchiolar intraluminal polyps.95 COP most often resolves with several months of corticosteroid therapy and frequently relapses with discontinuation of steroids. In one study of 51 COP cases treated with 1 mg/kg/d prednisolone following HCT, 78% resolved or remained stable and 22% progressed resulting in 16% case fatality.91\n",

Secondary PAP occurs rarely after HCT, possibly from macrophage depletion or anti\u2013GM-CSF alloantibody.121 The diagnosis is suggested by bronchoscopy yielding opaque/milky BAL fluid and PAS-positive material present within macrophages after exclusion of infectious pneumonia. However, lung biopsy is required for definitive diagnosis. PAP after HCT may be self-limited but can also progress to fatal respiratory failure. Optimal treatment of this rare entity, including the role of GM-CSF therapy, is unknown. As is done in other settings, whole lung lavage should be considered in severe cases to restore alveolar ventilation with repeat lavage considered for recurrences.122\n",

Clinical manifestations include fever, cough, and respiratory distress. Radiographic findings range from small, peripheral nodules to diffuse opacities. Diagnosis requires lung biopsy with histology characterized by vascular occlusions in distal pulmonary vessels, entrapment of leukocytes, endothelial disruption, and infarction of adjacent tissue. In a single-center, retrospective study, grades II to IV acute and chronic GVHD were independent risk factors for developing PCT. Treatment of PCT consists of systemic corticosteroids (prednisone 1\u20132 mg/kg/d) until pulmonary symptoms resolve (typically within 2 weeks) followed by a steroid taper over 2 to 4 weeks. The strong association with acute and chronic GVHD, as well as the response to corticosteroid therapy, suggests that PCT is a manifestation of alloreactive lung injury.
