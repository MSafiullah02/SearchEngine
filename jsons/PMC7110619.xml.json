            "text": "Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is a coronaviral disease that can affect cats of any age, but is most prevalent among cats <3 years of age and especially from 4 to 16 months of age (Pedersen, 2009). FIP occurs commonly in catteries (pedigreed cats), shelters, kitten foster/rescue facilities and dense free-roaming colonies. Typical of an enzootic infection, the incidence of FIP can vary widely over time. The mortality is extremely high once clinical signs appear, although some cats can live with the disease for weeks, months or, rarely, years. A detailed clinical description of FIP can be found in earlier comprehensive reviews and will not be covered herein (Addie et al, 2009, Pedersen, 2009, Drechsler et al, 2011).",

            "text": "FIP virus (FIPV) arises through specific mutations in a common feline enteric coronavirus (FECV) that is ubiquitous in cats throughout the world and not in itself an important pathogen (Pedersen, 2009). FECV is shed in the feces of most apparently healthy cats in large multi-cat environments (Pedersen et al., 2004) and transmission results from direct ingestion of feces or contaminated litter and other fomites. Kittens usually become infected at around 9 weeks of age (Pedersen et al, 2004, Pedersen et al, 2008). Mutants of FECV capable of causing FIP are probably generated in large numbers during this initial infection, when levels of FECV replication are extremely high (Pedersen et al, 2008, Vogel et al, 2010). However, only a small proportion of cats exposed to these mutant viruses will develop FIP. Resistance to FIP is complicated and involves genetic susceptibility, age at the time of exposure and a number of stressors that occur at the same time as infection and have a negative impact on the ability of the infected cat to eliminate the virus. The time period between initial FECV exposure and clinical signs of disease can be as short as 2\u20133 weeks, as long as several months or, rarely, years. This period could reflect the time it takes for mutant FIPVs to evolve, or for the disease to progress from a subclinical to clinical state. Subclinical infections are usually limited to the mesenteric lymph nodes and can resolve or progress (Pedersen, Black, 1983, Legendre, Bartges, 2009, Pedersen, 2009). The onset of overt disease is a signal that the cat's battle with the virus has been lost and a return to normal health is extremely uncommon. There are rare occasions when a cat will make an apparent recovery, only to have clinical signs recur months and even years later (Legendre and Bartges, 2009).",

            "text": "Owners that have acquired a kitten or young cat often become deeply attached to the animal before the first signs of FIP occur. The diagnosis of FIP, especially with its extreme mortality rate and lack of any effective treatment, has a great psychological effect on many owners. It also is the trigger for an owner communication most feared by both breeders and shelter managers. Because some cats with FIP are still reasonably well at the time of diagnosis and can often live weeks or months longer with only symptomatic treatment, owners might be reluctant to accept the diagnosis or the fact that there is no effective treatment. This can lead to a series of additional tests that often purport to be highly sensitive and specific, but seldom provide the desired answer and might even further cloud the diagnosis. The lack of an effective therapy often complicates matters, and some owners will go to great lengths to research the disease on the Internet and other sources. This can lead them to individuals who claim to have found treatments for the disease that are either curative or will prolong life. These claims are frequently supported by anecdotal statements from owners who have found such treatments beneficial. Unfortunately, due to problems with interpreting available diagnostic tests, not all cats diagnosed with FIP actually have the disease. If these cats have a self-limiting condition other than FIP, they will appear to respond well to almost any non-harmful treatment that is administered. Such cases give credibility to a particular treatment when none is deserved.",

Elevations in serum and urine bilirubin (or biliverdin) are usually not associated with elevations in liver enzymes (Addie et al., 2009) and the liver is often spared in cats with FIP; evidence of cholestasis is not observed. Therefore, elevations in blood and urine bilirubin are not due to liver disease, as has been previously suggested, but rather are due to the increased destruction of RBCs in both lesions and in the circulation and difficulties in clearing hemoglobin breakdown products. Cats are notoriously poor at glucuronidation (Court and Greenblatt, 2000), thus limiting the rate that bilirubin and biliverdin are metabolized and recycled. If these common abnormalities are coupled with the usual signalment and clinical signs, a diagnosis of FIP can be made with high certainty. Even though many cats with FIP have characteristic CBCs, albumin and globulin levels and A:G, it is not reasonable to expect that every targeted parameter is always abnormal in the right direction. It is more important to look at the total picture and always in context of the signalment, clinical and physical features.",

The fluid is usually yellow tinged due to the presence of bilirubin and, rarely, green-tinged due to the presence of biliverdin.

Five cats had a hypoechoic subcapsular rim in one or both kidneys. Free fluid was present in the peritoneal cavity in seven cats and in the retroperitoneal space in one cat. Abdominal lymphadenopathy was noted in nine cats. The spleen had normal echogenicity in 14 cats and was hypoechoic in two. One cat had bilateral orchitis, with loss of normal testicular architecture.

In the absence of other common laboratory abnormalities, it is sometimes helpful to analyze these proteins by gel electrophoresis to determine the exact cause of the elevation. Taylor et al. (2010) performed a retrospective study of all serum protein electrophoresis (SPE) results from cats presented to the University of Bristol Feline Centre, UK, from 2002 to 2009; 155 results met the inclusion criteria. Clinical cases with a final diagnosis were classified as having normal or abnormal serum protein electrophoretic patterns compared to 77 clinically normal cats. Of the 155 cases, 136 (87.7%) had abnormal serum electrophoresis profiles, most commonly from a polyclonal increase in gamma globulins. The most common disease classification associated with serum protein abnormalities was infectious/inflammatory disease (80/136; 58.8%), including 39 cats diagnosed with FIP. Monoclonal gammopathy was observed in four cats, including one with FIP, one with lymphoma and two cases of splenic plasmacytoma.",

Ocular FIP is usually manifested by a uveitis, with idiopathic uveitis being one of the main differential diagnoses. Wiggans et al. (2013) compared the two disorders, particularly the diagnostic utility of aqueous humor cytology. They noted that the duration of disease tended to be shorter in cats with FIP than with idiopathic uveitis. In cats with idiopathic uveitis, microbial nucleic acids, antigens, or antibodies against a causative agent were seldom found in blood/serum, while serum feline coronavirus titers \u22651:6400 were detected only in cats with FIP. On cytological examination of the aqueous humor, plasma cell numbers were correlated with keratic precipitates and disease duration. As expected, clinically detectable hyphema correlated with erythrocyte numbers, while there was no correlation between cell numbers in the anterior chamber and aqueous flare. Although aqueous humor contained predominantly neutrophils in cats with FIP and large reactive lymphocytes and plasma cells appeared more frequently in cats with idiopathic uveitis, neither clinical nor cytologic assessment of anterior chamber contents differed significantly between cats with idiopathic or FIP-associated uveitis.",

The main problem with antibody tests is that both FECVs and FIPVs, being virtually identical to each other, evoke the same antibody responses. Titers also tend to be high among healthy cats in the same environments that foster FIP. Feline coronavirus antibody titers, if accurately performed, are nonetheless of some value. Although many healthy FECV exposed cats have titers by indirect immunofluorescence assay from 1:100 to 1:400 (Pedersen et al., 2008), as do many cats with FIP, the likelihood of a titer being associated with FIP increases with its magnitude. Fewer healthy cats have titers of 1:1600, while titers \u22651:3200 are highly suggestive of FIP (Hartmann et al., 2003). Healthy cats with titers <1:100 infrequently shed FECV in their feces, while cats with titers of 1:400 are usually positive for feline coronavirus in the feces (Pedersen et al., 2008).",

Thirteen effusions, one plasma sample and three undefined samples from cats with FIP that had unexpectedly low serum coronavirus antibody titers were examined by real-time reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR. Increasing amounts of virus correlated with lower signals in indirect immunofluorescent, ELISA and rapid immunomigration antibody tests in 70% of samples.

A classical test, which is still marketed, is the \u20187b\u2019 antibody test. This test was developed on a faulty premise that FECVs lack the ORF 7b gene and hence do not produce the ORF 7b protein product, while FIPVs have the ORF 7b gene, produce the protein and therefore also evoke an antibody response to the ORF 7b protein. It is now well known that virtually all field isolates of FIPVs and FECVs possess an intact ORF 7b gene and therefore both evoke anti-ORF 7b antibodies. This fact, as it relates to the 7b antibody test, was reconfirmed by Kennedy et al. (2008); 95 serum samples submitted for various diagnostic assays and 20 samples from specific-pathogen-free cats (free of coronavirus infection and antibodies) were tested for antibodies against the purified ORF 7b protein. As expected, expression of the ORF 7b protein, as indicated by detection of antibodies against the protein, was found in most feline coronavirus (i.e. FECV or FIPV) infected cats and it was concluded that seropositivity for this protein was not specific for FIPV and could not be used to diagnose FIP. In essence, the 7b antibody test is no different than any other feline coronavirus antibody test.",

This application of the test should be discouraged, because the odds that a significant proportion of cats in the cattery will be shedding FECV at any given time are high, while the odds of an adult FECV shedder developing FIP are very low.

However, the presence of inhibitors needs to be taken into consideration and can affect quantitative measurements of viral levels (Dye et al., 2008). Large amounts of virus are shed in the feces for many weeks, and even months, after initial infection, but with time and lack of re-exposure most cats will stop shedding (Pedersen et al., 2008). However, some cats can shed at high levels for prolonged periods of time and some cats that have stopped shedding become susceptible to reinfection (Pedersen et al., 2008).",

Even so, the enteric signs are uncommon and usually mild and short lived (Pedersen et al., 2008). Given the fact that the majority of shelter and cattery cats shed the virus at any given time, coupled with its low intrinsic disease potential, there is little need to test for its presence in shelters or catteries other than as a means toward eliminating FECV from the premises and thus lowering the chances of cats dying of FIP. However, without keeping cat and especially kitten numbers low, and evoking an extremely strict quarantine, FECV is both difficult to rid from premises and easily re-acquired. Moreover, establishing and maintaining a FECV free cattery or shelter run counter to the purpose of such facilities. Even if a coronavirus free status is achieved, kittens from such an environment will ultimately become exposed when they are sent elsewhere or new cats introduced. Although fecal testing for FECV is not a very productive procedure, there is some predictive value in knowing the proportion and frequency of fecal shedders. The greater the proportion and frequency of shedding, the more likely there will be FIP losses (Foley et al., 1997).",

PCR-based tests for feline coronaviruses start with the purification of RNA from feces, blood or tissues; the RNA is then reverse transcribed to complementary DNA (cDNA). A small region of this cDNA that encodes a feline coronavirus-specific sequence is then amplified thousands of times and the product identified as a single distinct band by gel electrophoresis. Further refinements have been made to increase the sensitivity and specificity of PCR. Nested PCR is a method that greatly increases the ability of the test to detect very small amounts of feline coronavirus RNA as cDNA (Gamble et al., 1997). Nested PCR involves amplifying a larger fragment of the viral cDNA in the first step, purifying this PCR product and then amplifying a smaller piece from within the larger amplified DNA in a second reaction. A nested PCR was reportedly >90% sensitive and specific in detecting FIPV in ascites from cats with effusive FIP (Gamble et al., 1997). Although very sensitive, nested PCRs are plagued by DNA contamination with PCR products, which causes false positive reactions.",

            "text": "The problem of laboratory contamination with PCR products can be avoided by using real time RT-PCR and, for this reason, virtually all PCR-based diagnostic tests for FECV/FIPV RNA are based on this format. It is generally conceded that real time RT-PCR is quite sensitive and specific in detecting and semi-quantitating fecal coronavirus (FECV) shedding in both experimental and naturally infected cats (Pedersen et al, 2008, Pedersen et al, 2009, Pedersen et al, 2012, Kipar et al, 2010, Vogel et al, 2010, An et al, 2011, Addie et al, 2012, Amer et al, 2012, Wang et al, 2013). However, a high sensitivity and specificity is conditional on a number of variables. Samples must be collected to maximize virus content, the viral RNA within these samples must be properly extracted and preserved, the RNA has to be properly purified and reverse transcribed, any PCR inhibitors (usually in feces) must be negated (Dye et al., 2008), all reagents must be properly designed and maintained in active form, and samples properly run by knowledgeable technicians on reliable instruments. A remaining problem is the high degree of viral genome diversity, which affects the binding of primers used in RT-PCR tests. An attempt was made to address this by designing a RT-PCR that takes into account a degree of genomic variability in various feline coronaviruses (Horny\u00e1k et al., 2012). Most of these technical aspects, although daunting, can be overcome with attention to detail. Therefore, it is generally assumed that real time RT-PCR is a sensitive way to detect coronavirus RNA in feces and diseased tissues/effusions. Nevertheless, in one study testing its accuracy, PCR-based testing was found to be only 80\u201390% accurate in confirming the presence of FIPV in diseased tissues (Sharif et al., 2010). In another study, only 377/854 (44%) of peritoneal effusion specimens from cats suspected but not confirmed of having FIP tested positive by RT-PCR (Soma et al., 2013). Strangely, positivity was 78-92% in purebreds vs. 35% in mixed breed cats.",

However, in a second study using the same procedure, 54% of healthy cats, especially in the 6\u201312 month age range, also tested positive (Can-Sahna et al., 2007). This was later explained by experimental infection studies of FECV by Kipar et al. (2010) and Vogel et al. (2010), both of whom demonstrated that viremia accompanied intestinal infection. FECV was identified in blood monocyte/macrophages in 40% of experimentally FECV infected cats by day 14 and 14% remained viremic at day 48 post-infection; FECV was detected in several internal organs after fecal shedding ceased (Kipar et al., 2010).",

Mutations in the ORF 3c and at the S1/S2 gene cleavage site are unique to each FIPV and therefore are not good candidates (Licitra et al, 2013, Pedersen et al, 2009) . The most FIPV-specific mutations are two single nucleotide changes within the fusion protein region of the spike or surface (S) protein (Chang et al., 2010). Either one of these mutations occurs in >98% of FIPVs detected in diseased tissues, but no results have been reported regarding whether these mutations are present in blood at detectable levels. It is also possible that these mutations could be found in healthy cats with abortive or subclinical infections (Porter et al., 2014). Even if highly sensitive and specific FIPV RNA detection tests could be developed, it appears that many cats with naturally occurring FIP do not have detectable levels of viral RNA in their blood, either within plasma or concentrated in the white cell fraction.",

Drugs that affect the cellular machinery are least likely to be effective because they tend to have a negative effect on both the host and virus. The most successful antiviral therapies have involved drugs that target specific regions of the viral genome that regulate key processes in infection or replication. Feline coronaviruses have several genes that are similar in activity to those of HIV-1, including RNA-dependent polymerase and viral proteases. The retroviral protease is another important target for HIV-1 and a combination of reverse transcriptase, protease and integrase inhibitors have effectively reduced HIV-1 to a chronic subclinical infection in most patients. Based on experience with other viral protease inhibitors, similar drugs are now being developed against the main protease (3CL) encoded by both coronaviruses and noroviruses (Kim et al., 2013). Many of the structural proteins of coronavirus are first transcribed from mRNA as polyproteins which are cleaved by proteases into their constituent parts. Although cellular proteases have been assumed to play a major role in cleaving FIPV polyproteins, preliminary in vitro tests show 3CL protease inhibitors are effective in inhibiting FIPV replication at levels that are not toxic to cells (Kim et al., 2013).",

This confirms a role for cellular immunophilins (cyclophilins) in coronavirus replication. The authors postulated that non-immunosuppressive derivatives of cyclosporine A might not only serve as broad-spectrum inhibitors of emerging human coronaviruses, but also of the more ubiquitous coronavirus pathogens of humans and livestock. The ability of cyclosporine A to inhibit feline coronavirus replication in cell culture has been confirmed, but it has not been tested in vivo (Tanaka et al., 2013). The problem with antiviral agents such as chloroquine and cyclosporine is that they work through pathways common to cellular and viral activities. Coronaviruses usurp normal cellular pathways to facilitate their own replication and the anti-viral effects of compounds such as chloroquine and cyclosporine cannot be separated from their other effects on cells and, therefore, the host. For example, the antiviral activity of chloroquine in vivo was inferior to in vitro activity and there were toxic effects in the host (Takano et al., 2013b).",

These include immunostimulants such as staphylococcal A protein, ImmunoRegulin (Propriobacterium acnes), Acemannan (mucopolysaccharide extract of Aloe vera leaves) and Imulan (lymphocyte T cell immunomodulator). Polyprenyl immunostimulant (PI) is the latest plant extract claimed to prolong the lives of some cats with mild forms of dry FIP.1 The current rush to use this biologic agent was based on a study of three cats, one of which was reportedly cured of FIP after long-term treatment (Legendre and Bartges, 2009). However, all three cats had non-effusive disease localized to a single mesenteric lymph node; two had subclinical disease and were healthy at the onset of the trial and the third appeared only mildly affected. The authors reported that the treatment had no effect on cats with more severe disease, such as effusive FIP, although no results were provided on this point. The authors also failed to consider that cats with such localized disease could potentially undergo spontaneous remission.1 Subsequent trials with PI that excluded cats with effusive FIP and cats with severe disease (presumably from dry FIP) showed only a 5% survival at 1 year.1 Therefore, there is no evidence that PI is curative of FIP in any form and no evidence that it can significantly prolong life in even cats with the mildest disease.",

            "text": "It must be emphasized that the use of all such biologic immune stimulants for the treatment of FIP is off-label, as most were conditionally licensed or licensed for use in cats with FeLV or FIV infections, or in the case of PI, feline herpesvirus. Furthermore, these compounds can be expensive, with no evidence of significant benefit. The dosage regimen for such drugs is often uncertain and frequently based more on limiting costs to the owners by administering small doses or treating less frequently. This lack of information is in itself evidence of the quality of pre-testing. None of these immunostimulants have been subjected to vigorous pharmacokinetic and bioactivity studies, although all appear to be safe. In the absence of adequate pretesting, it is important to do valid clinical testing prior to recommending these agents for general use. Proper clinical testing requires the use of a placebo control, randomization, double blinding, sufficient case numbers for statistical validity and accurate determination of disease status. It is also paradoxical that many veterinarians use these types of drugs in combination with more traditional prednisone/prednisolone treatment, since one drug reportedly stimulates the immune system while the other drug suppresses it.",

            "text": "FIP has been well documented in virtually every species of Felidae. FIP of domestic cats and cheetahs has been historically intertwined (Pearks Wilkerson et al., 2004). Initial studies of genetic diversity among cheetahs concluded that they were extremely inbred as a species, to the point of accepting skin grafts from each other, and that this inbreeding was a result of an extreme bottleneck that occurred some 12,000 years earlier. If correct, this degree of inbreeding would have made the species highly vulnerable to the introduction of a novel and highly fatal pathogen. This paradigm was thought to have been realized when a fatal epizootic of what appeared to be FIP caused by feline coronavirus occurred among captive cheetahs at Winston Safari Park in Oregon, USA, in the early 1980s. The outbreak started with two confirmed FIP deaths among cheetahs recently acquired from Sacramento and, within months, other cheetahs in the park fell ill. Retrospective serum samples tested for antibodies demonstrated that, prior to 1982, all cheetah sera were negative, but within 6 months of the arrival of the index cases, 100% of the cheetahs had seroconverted. Ninety percent of the 60 cheetahs in the park became ill over the next 2 years, manifesting a range of clinical signs such as weight loss, diarrhea, jaundice, hepatic and renal disease, and gingivitis, all ascribed to coronavirus, often without firm evidence. The conclusions of these early studies were that captive cheetahs were highly susceptible to feline coronavirus due to extreme inbreeding and that the introduction of coronavirus into wild cheetahs could be catastrophic. This was later found to be incorrect. Castro-Prieto et al. (2011) tested a much larger sampling of wild cheetahs and reported that they had much more MHC class I and II diversity and immune competence than previously believed, contradicting previous speculation that the cheetah is a paradigm species for inbreeding vulnerability. This was confirmed in another manner by studies of feline coronavirus infection in wild and captive cheetahs (Gaffney et al., 2012). Cheetahs in the wild were found to have an extremely low rate of exposure to many common cat infections, including feline coronavirus, and were rarely affected by infectious diseases. However, almost half of healthy captive cheetahs shed feline coronavirus in their feces persistently, transiently, or intermittently, and FIP losses after the initial outbreak remained very low. Therefore, it appears that domestic cats and cheetahs handle feline coronavirus in a similar manner. Although already briefly described in the mountain lion or puma (Puma concolor), a detailed report of FIP in a California mountain lion has been recently published (Stephenson et al., 2013).",

            "text": "An epizootic of catarrhal enteritis caused by a novel coronavirus was first described in pet ferrets in the USA in 1993 (Murray et al., 2010). Subsequently, a disease identical in appearance to dry FIP of cats was also described in ferrets in the USA (Murray et al., 2010). The causative virus of the epizootic catarrhal enteritis (ECE) was named ECE virus (ECEV), while the causative virus of FIP-like disease was named ferret systemic coronavirus (FRSCV). These infections have subsequently been reported in pet ferrets in Japan and Europe (Michimae et al, 2010, Wise et al, 2010, Provacia et al, 2011). A genetic analysis of ECEVs and FRSCVs indicated that the two coronaviruses were closely related but genetically unique (Wise et al., 2010). Interestingly, functional mutations in the ORF 3c gene resembling those of FIPV were seen in 2/3 FRSCV isolates from ferrets, but were not present in the ECEVs. Terada et al. (2014) detected coronavirus in the feces of 44/79 (56%) pet ferrets in Japan and classified the viruses into two genotypes based on S gene sequences. Genotype 1 was related to the FRSCV reported by Wise et al. (2010), whereas all published ECE strains fell within genotype 2 and resembled ECEV. These two ferret coronaviruses appear at first glance to resemble FECVs and FIPV in cats. Whether viruses causing FIP-like disease and ECE in ferrets are indeed genotypically distinct, or a spectrum of closely related strains, remains to be determined. What is certain is that ferret infectious peritonitis is a relatively new and increasing problem in pet ferrets and is hauntingly similar to the appearance of FIP for the first time in cats in the late 1950s (Pedersen, 2009). The fact that ferret coronavirus exists in several genetic forms indicates that coronaviruses have been in the species for some time. Has a new ferret coronavirus evolved that is more likely to mutate to cause infectious peritonitis? As ferrets have become more popular as pets, do they face the same risk factors that faced cats as they became more popular as pets? Are similar mutations responsible for systemic disease in both feline and ferret coronaviruses? These questions remain unanswered.",

            "text": "The diagnosis of FIP should not be difficult. It is a disease mainly of kittens and young cats from multi-cat environments, such as shelters, cat/kitten rescue organizations or catteries. The presenting historical and physical signs, whether in the effusive or non-effusive form, are relatively stereotypic and the results of routine CBCs, serum protein, albumin and globulin determinations often confirm the suspicions obtained from the history and physical examinations. Yellow-tinged, mucinous, inflammatory peritoneal (or pleural) effusions are characteristics for the effusive form of disease, while neurologic signs, uveitis and masses in the ileo-cecocolic region, kidneys and mesenteric lymph nodes are characteristics for the non-effusive form of FIP. Coronavirus antibody titers can be misleading in the range of 1:25\u20131:1600, but are increasingly relevant at higher titers. Gross and microscopic findings at postmortem examination are often undervalued and should be given greater importance. Immunohistochemistry and real time RT-PCR are very useful for identifying FIPV antigens in tissues with lesions or effusions and, if done properly, can provide a definitive diagnosis. The holy grail for FIP diagnostics is a simple blood test that would detect FIPVs associated with active disease and not FECVs or mutants of FECV that are not yet capable of causing FIP. Currently, there is no effective treatment for FIP and mortality is extremely high. However, the fact that a rare cat appears to make a spontaneous recovery with good supportive care is enough of an impetus to lead owners to try a number of alternative therapies that are touted mainly on the Internet.1 Many of these therapies are expensive and come with a high emotional burden. It is important that all such treatments be adequately tested on an adequate number of cats with confirmed disease and in a randomized, placebo controlled and double blinded manner. The most promising therapies will probably involve drugs that specifically target viral proteins important in viral replication. Coronaviruses have large genomes with many potential target genes and hopefully safe and effective antiviral drugs will be developed. It is anticipated that such drugs might be developed as offshoots of research investigating emerging and highly fatal coronavirus infections of humans.",
