By the end of May of 2003, the number of SARS patients declined to single digit and this significant and rapid containment seems to suggest the effectiveness of these control measures. Since these measures unfortunately had significant negative impact on the daily life and the economic growth of the country, it becomes extremely important, for future control and prevention of possible outbreak of SARS and other infectious diseases, to determine whether relaxed measures might be able to yield similar results.",

            "text": "In addition to the unprecedented massive campaign involving newspapers, radios, televisions and posters to improve public awareness leading to some changes of daily life at both the individual and community levels (such as regular ventilation, reduction of social activities, increasing regular exercises), a national wide system of SARS checkpoints and health registrations [2] was quickly established, and the body temperature was measured at bus stations, train stations, airports, shipsides and major meeting facilities. The Chinese government also implemented a very strict quarantine and isolation policy, summarized in the Clinic Diagnostic Standard of SARS decreed by the Ministry of Health of China (MHC) [9]. Quarantine measures were implemented, with different strengths for three distinct environments: complete isolation, partial isolation and free environment [13]. In the hospital settings, complete isolation was strictly implemented. This included isolation and mandatory treatment of diagnosed and suspected cases, quarantining and close observation of individuals with fever, isolating areas and buildings hosted suspected and diagnosed SARS cases. Therefore, possible transmission links between the spreading sources in these areas and the outside were broken. In addition, all health care workers taking care of diagnosed and suspected SARS patients were fully isolated from the outside, in contrast to some other SARS affected regions [3], [4], [10]. Great restrictions were also imposed on the flow of individuals in many residential areas, villages, schools, universities, major companies and other partially isolated communities, and a very systematic recording system for the flow of individuals was developed. These helped to significantly reduce the basic reproductive number and also speed up the hospitalization time. These communities were not fully isolated, so the tracking was effective but not perfect, and hence once some infective were identified, only a portion of exposed individuals could be tracked. In the free environment, there was no effective restriction for the movement and contact of individuals and the tracking was poor. Therefore, once an infective was identified, very few who had previous contact with the infective can be tracked. In summary, the quarantine measures implemented by the Chinese government involved the division of the whole population into two parallel blocks: one block corresponding to the so-called free environment where individuals can move and interact with each other without restrictions, and another block corresponding to the so-called isolated environment (mostly hospitals) that hosted all individuals with record of exposure to SARS virus or showing symptoms similar to those of SARS, in addition to the health care workers taking care of the SARS patients and suspected cases. The second block was relatively isolated from the first block except exposed and infective eventually enter to this isolated block and some misdiagnosed individuals were discharged and then entered the free environment.",

One of the contribution of this article is to lump several parameters together and use only the statistical data reported by MHC as the basis to calculate the basic adequate contact rate and the basic reproductive number. These two calculated numbers, together with other parameters describing the epidemiological features of SARS virus that have been determined in the two recent articles [16], [17], allow us to use the model to generate the infectious curves that are in excellent agreement with the daily reported data from MHC. This agreement thus provides a convincing validation for the model and our identified parameters. We then vary parameters related to different control strategies and carry out intensive simulations to compare the influence and effectiveness of these control measures including the influence of different quarantine intensity, speed and duration. Our simulations based on the model show that the rapid decrease of the SARS patients is attributed to the high successful quarantine rate and timely implementation of the quarantine measures, and indeed all of the prevention and control measures implemented in China seem to be necessary, adequate and effective: premature relaxation of some quarantine measures would lead to a second outbreak, and delayed implementation of these quarantine measures by one or two days would lead to much larger number of infected individuals.",

The same discussions above apply to the term g(H,P,D), and we writeg(H,P,D)=\u03bbq(t)(\u03b4qP+D).Then, (2.1) becomes a linear non-autonomous system with the following subsystem:(3.2)E\u2032=\u03bbf(t)(\u03b4fE+I)\u2212(\u03b5+dep)E,I\u2032=\u03b5E\u2212diqI\u2212\u03b1I,P\u2032=depE+dspD\u2212bspP\u2212dpqP,D\u2032=\u03bbq(t)(\u03b4qP+D)+dpqP+diqI\u2212(\u03b1+\u03b3)D.This subsystem is obviously of fundamental importance for the prevention and control of SARS outbreak. In this section, we consider the long-term behaviours of the above subsystem under the assumption that the basic adequate contact rates in both blocks change continuously and are bounded, thus \u03bb\nf(t) is a continuous function bounded below by \u03bb\nf\n0 and above by \u03bb\nf\n*, \u03bb\nq(t) is also a continuous function bounded below by \u03bb\nq\n0 and above by \u03bb\nq\n*.",

Thus the basic reproductive number R\nM\n0f in Block F is the maximal number of secondary infections generated by an average infectious individual during the mean time staying in the I-class in an entirely susceptible population. This quantity thus determines the potential for the SARS virus to start an outbreak, or the extent of transmission in the absence of control measures. Similarly, we can define the minimal reproductive number in Block F asRm0f=\u03bbf0(\u03b5+\u03b4f(\u03b1+diq))(\u03b1+diq)(\u03b5+dep)and the maximal and minimal basic reproductive numbers in Block Q asRM0q=\u03bbq*(\u03b4qdsp+bsp+dpq)(bsp+dpq)(\u03b1+\u03b3)\u2212dspdpqandRm0q=\u03bbq*(\u03b4qdsp+bsp+dpq)(bsp+dpq)(\u03b1+\u03b3)\u2212dspdpq.The following theorem, standard in mathematical epidemiology, shows that the basic reproduction numbers determine the long-term outcome of the SARS outbreak.Theorem 3.1\nThe trivial solution of the model\n(3.2)\nis globally asymptotically stable if\nR\nM\n0f\u2a7d1 and\nR\nM\n0q\u2a7d1, and unstable if\nR\nm\n0f>1 or\nR\nm\n0q>1.\nProofWe first consider the equilibrium O(0,0,0,0) of the following linear autonomous system:(3.3)E\u2032=\u03bbf*(\u03b4fE+I)\u2212(\u03b5+dep)E,I\u2032=\u03b5E\u2212(diq+\u03b1)I,P\u2032=depE+dspD\u2212(bsp+dpq)P,D\u2032=\u03bbq*(\u03b4qP+D)+dpqP+diqI\u2212(\u03b1+\u03b3)D.The coefficient matrix isJ=\u03bbf*\u03b4f\u2212\u03b5\u2212dep\u03bbf*00\u03b5\u2212(\u03b1+diq)00dep0\u2212(bsp+dpq)dsp0diq\u03bbq*\u03b4q+dpq\u03bbq*\u2212(\u03b1+\u03b3).The characteristic polynomial of the matrix J is the product of det(J\n1) and det(J\n2), whereJ1=\u03c1\u2212\u03bbf*\u03b4f+\u03b5+dep\u2212\u03bbf*\u2212\u03b5\u03c1+\u03b1+diq, J2=\u03c1+bsp+dpq\u2212dsp\u2212\u03bbq*\u03b4q\u2212dpq\u03c1\u2212\u03bbq*+\u03b1+\u03b3.It is easy to see that all the four eigenvalues of the matrix J are real. Furthermore, when\u03bbf*\u2a7d(\u03b1+diq)(\u03b5+dep)\u03b5+\u03b4f(\u03b1+diq) and \u03bbq*\u2a7d(bsp+dpq)(\u03b1+\u03b3)\u2212dspdpq\u03b4qdsp+bsp+dpq,these eigenvalues are all negative so that the equilibrium O is globally asymptotically stable.When\u03bbfm>(\u03b1+diq)(\u03b5+dep)\u03b5+\u03b4f(\u03b1+diq) or \u03bbqm>(bsp+dpq)(\u03b1+\u03b3)\u2212dspdpq\u03b4qdsp+bsp+dpq,the matrix J has at least one positive eigenvalue.The standard comparison argument can then be used to obtain the stated results of the theorem. \u25a1\n",

            "text": "With the above preparation, we can now carry out some numerical simulations to validate our model, to discuss the effectiveness of control measures, and to see if alternatives are permitted.Simulation 1Comparison with daily reported dataIn Fig. 3\n, the curve in stars is the daily SARS patient number reported by MHC, and the continuous curve is the results simulated by our model with the aforementioned identified parameters. The simulated result shows that the number of the SARS patients increases rapidly during the first week, reaches the peak between May 11 and May 18, 2003, and with the maximal number between 3164 cases and 3220 cases. The reported data is 3068. This simulation suggests very good agreement with real data, serving as a validation of the model.\nSimulation 2The impact of the strict quarantine measure:Case 1The pattern of SARS transmission in China if there is no preventive and control measures.Assuming that there is no preventive and control measures implemented, but the toxicity of SARS virus naturally declines at the rate of 0.01 per unit time, then our model simulation shows a completely different pattern as shown in Fig. 4\n: the outbreak will peak at the end of October of 2004, with the maximal number 4.5 million before it declines to 10,000 cases (about 19 months after the peak) and then eventually disappear slowly.\nCase 2The pattern of SARS transmission if the preventive and control measures are relaxed prematurely.It is evident that preventive and control measures did play a significant role in the containment of SARS outbreak in China, these measures did have great negative impact to the daily life and economic development. It becomes natural, and also important for the control and prevention of the outbreak of SARS and other emerging infectious diseases, to ask whether those strict control measures could be relaxed and lifted earlier. To address this issue, we carried out some numerical simulations by taking \u03bb\nf(t) to be \u03bb\nt0(t), that is \u03bb\nf(t) when t\u2a7dt\n0 and \u03bb\nf(0)0.99t\u2212t0 when t>t\n0, where t\n0 represents the time when the prevention and control measures is relaxed in the Block F while the Block Q is still under complete control. Some of these simulation results with t\n0 being 30 (corresponding to May 19), 37 (corresponding to May 26), and 44 (corresponding to June 3), respectively, are shown in Fig. 5, Fig. 6, Fig. 7\n. In Fig. 5, the stars is the reported data of SARS patients and the broken line is the simulation curve for the number of SARS patients, and our simulation shows that SARS would rebound and the second peak of SARS epidemic would appear in China and the number of SARS patients at the second peak could reach over 4000, higher than that of the first peak. In comparison, Fig. 6, shows that although the number of SARS patients could increase again and the second peak of SARS epidemic would appear, the number of SARS patients at the second peak would be only 730, much less than that at the first peak. Note also that the time when the number of SARS patients falls below 4 would be postponed. With t\n0=44 shown in Fig. 7, however, the speed of the decrease of the number of SARS patients would be slightly slower (than the real data), there would be no second outbreak anymore.The simulation results seem to indicate strongly that all of the prevention and control measures implemented in China are necessary, adequate and effective, and that the time to relax prevention and control measures has significant impact not only on the rate at which the disease dies out but also on the transmission pattern.\n\nSimulation 3The influence of the delayed quarantineIn order to investigate the impact on the pattern of SARS epidemic of implementing the quarantine measure with different speed, we carried out our simulations with varying transfer rate d\niq. In Fig. 8\n, the stars and real lines are the same as that in Fig. 7. The bottom broken line at the bottom shows the daily number of SARS patients when all infective stay in the I-class for one additional day since April 21: the peak would be postponed for about 2 days and the number of SARS patients at the peak would increase by about 880 cases. The top broken line presents the daily number of SARS patients when all infective stay in I-class for two more days since April 21: the peak would be postponed for about 4 days but the number of SARS patients at the peak would increase by about 1900.\n",
