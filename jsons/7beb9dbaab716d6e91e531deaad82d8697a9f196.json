The invasion of human metastatic tumor cells (SN I2M renal-cell carcinoma, HTI 080 fibrosarcoma and A375M melanoma) into Matrigel-coated filters was inhibited by an anti-CD I3 MAb, WM 15, in a concentration-dependent manner. However, this MAb did not have any effect on tumor-cell adhesion and migration to the extracellular matrices, which may be involved in tumor-cell invasion. MAb WMl5 inhibited the",

Since our previous study indicated that bestatin, an aminopeptidase inhibitor, was able to inhibit tumor-cell invasion, as well as aminopeptidase activities of murine and human metastatic tumor cells, cell-surface aminopeptidase N/CD13 may be partly involved in the activation mechanism for type-IV collagenolysis to achieve tumor-cell invasion, and anti-CD I 3 MAb WM I 5 may inhibit tumor-cell invasion through a mechanism involving its inhibitory action on the aminopeptidase N in tumor cells.",

Cell-surface aminopeptidase activity was potently blocked by known inhibitors of the enzyme, such as bestatin and lJ0-phenanthroline (Ashmun and Look, 1990) . Bestatin has been shown to possess immunomodulatory effects, presumably through the inhibition of multiple aminopeptidases, including the augmentation of humoral and cellmediated immune responses and the activation of macrophages and natural killer cells to become cytotoxic against tumor cells (Schlorlemmer et al., 1983; Bruley-Rosset et al., 1979; Saito et al., 1978) . Talmadge et al. (1986) have reported that the administration of high doses of bestatin resulted in the significant inhibition of pre-existing experimental and spontaneous metastases in mice. We also demonstrated that bestatin inhibited tumor-cell invasion and the degradation of type-IV collagen by tumor cells, possibly through a mechanism involving its inhibitory action on aminopeptidases in tumor cells (Saiki et al., 19896; Yoneda et al., 1992) .",

N/('1)13 on tilmorinvnsion We have reported that bestatin, a potent inhibitor of aminopeptidases, including the isolated microsomal and cytosolic leucine aminopeptidase, aminopeptidase B and membrane-bound aminopeptidase, inhibited invasion of murine and human metastatic tumor cells in vitro, as well as the aminopcptidase activity of tumor cells (Saiki et ul.. 19896; Yoneda et ul., 1992) . Therefore, in order to determine the role of a cell-surface aminopeptidase X/CD 13 in the tumor inva-sive process, we examined the effect of 3 different MAbs specific for CD13 on the invasion of human metastatic cells into reconstituted basement membrane Matrigel in vitro. SN12M cells were incubated for 8 hr at 37\u00b0C with 3 MAbs specific for CD13 (WM15, My 7 and MCS-2) at concentrations ranging from 0.025 to 25 yg/ml in the upper compartment of the Transwell chamber. The results of a representative experiment (out of 3) are shown in Figure 1 , and demonstrate that the invasion of SN12M renal carcinoma cells into the Matrigel/ cells by flow cytometry after immunofluorescence labeling with the FITC-conjugated MAb WM1S disclosed that 3 tumor cells expressed a moderate or high level of aminopeptidase N at the cell surface (Fig. 3) . The distribution of CD13 on the cell surface was also examined by immunoelectron microscopy. Figure 4 shows that CD13 on the SN12M cell surface during the invasion into Matrigel was identified in the invasion edge of tumor cells in the Matrigel and no appreciable staining was observed in the reconstituted basement membrane Matrigel. The above results using one of the anti-CD13 mAbs (WMlS) clearly indicate that cell-surface aminopeptidase NICD13 and its specific distribution are associated with the invasion of metastatic tumor cells. However, the level of CD13 expression on the cell surface is distinct from the cell lines used, and is unlikely to correlate with the degree of inhibitory effect on tumor cell invasion by CD13-specific MAb WM1S.",

As shown in upper panel of Figure 5 , SN12M cells showed the various amino-acid-MCA-hydrolysing activities (Ala-, Pro-, Phe-, Gly-, Arg-and Leu-MCA). Ala-MCA was the most sensitive for the hydrolysing activity of tumor cells. The lower panel of Figure 4 shows that MAb WM1S at concentrations ranging from 0.01 to 10 Fgiml inhibited the Ala-MCA-hydrolysing activity of 3 different tumor cells in a concentration-dependent manner, as did bestatin. In contrast, another CDl3-specific MAb, MCS-2, which presumably recognizes the different epitopes of aminopeptidase N and showed no inhibition of tumor-cell invasion (Fig. l) , did not inhibit tbc aminopeptidase activity of tumor cells. The above result is in good agreement with the previous study of Ashmun and Look (1990) on the inhibition of aminopeptidase N by various CDl3-specific MAbs. This suggests that MAb WM15 may recognize the functionally active site of aminopeptidase N, as compared with other MAbs (My7 and MCS-2). We have also found that other aminopeptidase inhibitors, amastatin A and arphamenine B. were able to S u b S l r a t e S . inhibit tumor-cell invasion iri vitro (Saiki et ul., 19898) .

Metalloproteinases capable of specifically degrading type-IV collagen have also been postulated to play a role in tumor-cell invasion and metastasis (Tryggvason et al., 1987; Nakajima et al., 1987; Liotta et al., 1980; Nicolson, 1989) . We therefore invcstigated whether or not a CD13-specific MAb (WM1.5) is able to influence the degradation of type-IV collagen by tumor cells. SN12M cells were incubated for 24 hr in the presence or absence of MAb WM15 in wells pre-coated with 3H-labeled type-IV collagen. Figure 6 shows that MAb WM15 inhibited the degradation of labeled type-IV collagen by tumor cells in a concentrationdependent manner. In contrast, MAb 84H10 did not inhibit cell-mediated type-IV collagenolysis. We also observed that the conditioned medium from SN12M cells after 24-hr incubation degraded the labeled type-IV collagen, but that MAb 84H10 did not inhibit conditioned-medium-mediated type-IV collagenolysis (data not shown). The results indicate that the CD13-specific MAb WM15 inhibited type-IV collagenolytic activity in the presence of tumor cells, and that the inhibitory effect on tumor invasion by the MAb may be partly attributable to the inhibition of type-IV collagenolysis rather than to the inhibition of tumor-cell attachment and motility in the invasive process. The mechanism for the inhibition of enzymatic degradation by the MAb does not appear to depend on any direct effect against type-IV collagenase.",

            "text": "We have previously reported that a potent inhibitor of multiple aminopeptidases, bestatin, markedly inhibited the invasion of murine and human metastatic tumors and the degradation of type-IV collagenase by tumor cells but not by tumor-derived conditioned medium (Saiki et al., 1989b; Yoneda et al., 1992) . This suggests that the anti-invasive effect by the inhibitor is partly mediated by the inhibitory mechanism for the cell-surface aminopeptidase activity. Aminopeptidase N/CD13 is an important ecto-enzyme and plays physiological roles, not only in myeloid cells but also in cells from diverse tissues (Amoscato et al., 1990; Ashmun and Look, 1990;  FIGURE 6 -Effect of anti-CD13 MAb on the degradation of [3H]-collagen type IV by SN12M cells. SN12M cells were added to the wells pre-coated with [3H]-labeled type-IV collagen (3 x los cpmil.6 pgiml), and incubated with or without MAb at 37\u00b0C for 24 hr. Radioactivity in the supernatants was measured by liquid scintillation counting. Bars represent standard deviations. *, p < 0.01; * * , p < 0.001. Kuramochi et al., 1987) . Aminopeptidase activity was shown to increase in proportion to the activation and differentiation of macrophages in vivo (Morahan et al., 1980; Wachsmuth, 1975) . Gorvel et al. (1990) have reported that neutral aminopeptidases on the surface of granulocyte and macrophages could be associated with the activation of mouse thymic T lymphocytes. However, whether aminopeptidase NICD13 on normal or malignant cells acts as a regulatory enzyme or serves some other function remains to be determined.",

Of 3 MAbs specific for CD13, WM15 inhibited the invasion of SN12M, HT1080, or A375M tumor cells into reconstituted basement membrane Matrigel in a concentration-dependent manner, but the other two MAbs did not show any invasive property (Figs. 1,2) . The expression of CD13 on the surface of tumor cells was observed by flow cytometry with FITC-labeled WM15 (Fig. 3) , and the distribution on the surface was consistently located in the invasive processes (Fig. 4) . The level of CD13 expression on the surface of different tumor cells is not necessarily associated with the degree of the inhibition of tumor-cell invasion by WM1.5. Aminopeptidase activity in tumor cells was inhibited to a similar degree by the addition of WM15 as well as of bestatin, but was not inhibited by another anti-CD13 MAb, MCS-2 (Fig. 5) . The above results are well consistent with the previous reports on the inhibition of aminopeptidase N by various anti-CD13 MAbs (Ashmun and Look, 1990) . Thus, the inhibitory cffcct on tumor invasion is likely to be in parallel with inhibition of the aminopeptidase activity by the MAb.",

            "text": "Metalloproteinase activity of degrading basement membrane collagen type IV was first reported by Liotta et al. (1979) . Good correlation between type-IV collagenase activity and the metastatic potential of tumor cells has been found using a variety of human and animal tumor lines (Nakajima et al., 1987; Liotta et al., 1980) . AntLCD13 MAb (WM15) inhibited the degradation of type-IV collagen by SN12M cells in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 6 ). This result is in good agreement with our previous findings that bestatin, an aminopeptidase inhibitor, inhibited type-IV collagenolysis by tumor cells (Saiki et al., 1989b; Yoneda et al., 1992) . Chop et ul. (1989) found high levels of expression of plasma-membraneassociated aminopeptidase activity in rat mammary adenocareinoma cells, which spontaneously metastasize from rat mammary-fat-pad sites to the lymph nodes and the lung. Thus, aminopeptidase activity on metastatic tumor cells may be relevant to the cascade of tumor-invasion mechanisms by hydrolysing extracellular matrix components already cleaved by other proteinases, such as plasmin or type-IV collagenase (Nakajima and Chop, 1991) . However, our previous study using the zymography of SN12M-derived conditioned medium showed that the treatment of tumor cells with bestatin resulted in the disappearance of the 68-kDa type-IV collagenase level (active form) and slight reduction of the 72-kDa type-IV collagenase level (latent form) (Yoneda et aZ., 1992) . We also found that bestatin did not inhibit the hydrolyzing activity of tumor-derived plasmin , which can degrade basement-membrane components and activate the latent eollagenase produced by tumor cells (Liotta et al., 1981) . These results using anti-CD13 MAb WM15 as well as bestatin indicate that plasma-membrane aminopeptidase N/CD13 may be involved in the activation or conversion mechanisms of type-IV collagenase and other matrix proteinases such as stromelysin, possibly by removing N-terminal amino acid and initiating or completing activation processes. The role of membrane-bound aminopeptidases, including CD13, in tumor invasion and metastasis rcmains to be dctcrmined in detail.",
