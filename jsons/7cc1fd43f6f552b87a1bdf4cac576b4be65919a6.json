The animals were sacrificed 4, 7, 15,21,30, and 60 days postinoculation. 5HT and 5hydrodryindolacetic acid (SHIAA) in raphe and cortex were determined by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with electrochemical detection.

The content of 5HT or SHIAA and 5HT/ 5HIAA ratios were not significantly different in infected compared with control mice. However, a decrease of 5HT turnover rate, determined after pargyline treatment, was observed in the raphe and not in the cortex of infected mice at 4 and 7 days after the inoculation. The turnover rate/(5HT)o in raphe is decreased in infected mice with signs of illness, suggesting a lower density of 5HT innervation in this brain area.

In contrast, blocking M A 0 may be used to determine turnover rates. The latter is a good index of neuronal activity in different groups of animals.

The advantage of this type of subclinical infection of the CNS in neurochemical studies has been documented [Lima et al, 19831. Because of the multiple regulatory mechanisms of monoamine metabolism in the CNS, the concentration of 5HT may not change even in neuronal disfunction. And even if changes occur, they may not accurately reflect neuronal activity [Neff and Tozer, 1968; King et al, 19851 . Thus, measuring 5HT turnover rate is necessary and should be estimated by various pharmacological approaches.

The accumulation of 5HT or the decline of 5HIAA need not correspond exactly (Figs. 1A,3) . This is probably the result of the existance of multiple pools of 5HT [Lane and Aprison, 19781 . Thus other methods such as the administration of inhibitors that do not completely block enzyme activity or administration of probenecid, which effect could differ in different brain regions, generate pharmacological and analytical difficulties [Neckers and Meek, 19761. In the present report we show that the content of 5HT and 5HIAA are not significantly modified by the infection of the CNS. However, the disfunction is observed only when specific pharmacological agents are given as demonstrated by the decrease in the turnover rate of 5HT in the raphe (neurons) and to a smaller degree in the cortex (terminals) of infected mice. The fact that significant variations of turnover rate are observed in INS as well as IS mice suggests that signs of the illness could be dissociated from the biochemical damage of the brain produced by the virus.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 88, "end": 110, "text": "[Bonilla et al, 19801.", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 199, "end": 221, "text": "[Delsedime et al, 1984", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 224, "end": 251, "text": "Damasio and Vanhoese, 19851", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 288, "end": 309, "text": "[Fishman et al, 19851", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 365, "end": 383, "text": "[Maurizi, 1985a,b]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 556, "end": 574, "text": "[Lima et al, 19831", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 753, "end": 779, "text": "[Walder and Bradish, 19791", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 890, "end": 909, "text": "[Lima et al, 19831.", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1139, "end": 1161, "text": "[Neff and Tozer, 1968;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1162, "end": 1179, "text": "King et al, 19851", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1422, "end": 1441, "text": "[Tozer et al, 1966;", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 1442, "end": 1465, "text": "Neckers and Meek, 1976;", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 1466, "end": 1483, "text": "King et al, 19851", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1647, "end": 1671, "text": "[Lane and Aprison, 19781", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1919, "end": 1944, "text": "[Neckers and Meek, 19761.", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1562, "end": 1574, "text": "(Figs. 1A,3)", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "By administering pargyline, a significant decrease in the turnover rate of 5HT in raphe at 4 and 7 days after inoculation was observed (Fig. 1) .
