While HeV is confined to Australia, more recent NiV outbreaks have been reported in Bangladesh, India and the Philippines. The clinical manifestations of both henipaviruses in humans appear similar, with a predominance of an acute encephalitic syndrome. Likewise, the pathological features are similar and characterized by disseminated, multi-organ vasculopathy comprising endothelial infection/ulceration, vasculitis, vasculitis-induced thrombosis/occlusion, parenchymal ischemia/microinfarction, and parenchymal cell infection in the central nervous system (CNS), lung, kidney and other major organs. This unique dual pathogenetic mechanism of vasculitis-induced microinfarction and neuronal infection causes severe tissue damage in the CNS. Both viruses can also cause relapsing encephalitis months and years after the acute infection. Many animal models studied to date have largely confirmed the pathology of henipavirus infection, and provided the means to test new therapeutic agents and vaccines. As the bat is the natural host of henipaviruses and has worldwide distribution, spillover events into human populations are expected to occur in the future.

Since then, nonpathogenic Cedar virus has also been included into Henipavirus (71) . More recently, many newly discovered African henipaviruses and a pathogenic henipavirus from the Philippines have been reported, all of which have not been isolated or fully characterized (14, 27). Hendra virus (HeV) and Nipah virus (NiV) are enveloped, pleomorphic virions with diameters averaging about 500 nm, but may range from about 40 to 1900 nm in length (38, 55) . Each virion contains a tangle of nucleocapsids with a herringbone structure typical of paramyxoviruses. As negative-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses, they have unusually large genomes of more than 18 000 nucleotides, comprising six genes encoding for the nucleocapsid, phosphoprotein, matrix protein, fusion glycoprotein (F), attachment glycoprotein (G) and the large polymerase ( Figure 1) .The viral G protein attaches to the host cell ephrin B2 and/or B3 receptor, and activates the F protein to initiate viral envelop and host membrane fusion and viral entry (4, 82, 91) .",

Most likely urine and oronasal secretions from infected animals were responsible for passing the infection to humans through direct or possibly airborne exposure (75, 92, 109) . In the NiV outbreak in Malaysia and Singapore, the pig was the main intermediate host, and pig farmers, abattoir workers, pork sellers and army personnel involved with culling of pigs had the highest prevalence of infection (2, 13, 88, 95, 106) . Bat-to-pig transmission could have resulted from pigs consuming half-eaten, contaminated fruits dropped by bats (20). Other domestic animals such as dogs, cows and goats may have the potential to act as intermediate hosts for NiV (18, 76, 133) . Human HeV outbreaks were closely associated with infection in horses and indeed occurred mainly among veterinarians, stable workers and other personnel in close contact with horses. Though rare, the HeV-infected dog may also have the potential to be an intermediate host (97) . Bat-to-horse transmission remains unclear but is likely to be due to environmental contamination from bat urine or other bat-derived materials (31, 127) . Interestingly, in the henipavirus outbreak in the Philippines, the majority of patients were involved with slaughtering infected horses and/or consuming under-cooked horse meat (14).",

In other health staff involved with patient care, serum neutralization tests were found to be negative, possibly because of good clinical prophylactic measures (78) . In the Philippines' henipavirus outbreak, the clinical and epidemiological evidence also suggested human-tohuman transmission (14). To date, bat-to-human or human-tohuman HeV transmission has not been reported (69) .

Subsequently in Bangladesh, the first NiV outbreaks were only suspected after these tests were found to be positive in patients (54) . In human NiV infection, IgM seroconversion from day 4 to day 12 was about 65%-100%, persisting for at least 3 months, while IgG seroconversion by day 25 was 100% and persisted for several years (17, 101). These tests have also been used widely for investigative field studies in bats and other animals (56, 58, 120) . Specific IgM or IgG has also been reported in HeV-infected patients (47, 85, 109) .",

Acute henipavirus infection is characterized by disseminated small vessel vasculopathy comprising endothelial infection/ulceration, vasculitis (Figure 2A ,G) and vasculitis-induced thrombosis/occlusion (Figure 2A) , often resulting in parenchymal ischemia and microinfarction in the central nervous system (CNS) ( Figure 2D) , lung, kidney and other major organs (134, 136) .

            "text": "The pathological features of relapsing henipavirus encephalitis were based on an autopsy case of HeV (134) and autopsies of relapsing NiV encephalitis (114, 136) . Relapsing HeV and NiV encephalitides are similar where pathology was confined to the CNS. Confluent and extensive parenchymal necrosis, edema and inflammation were seen mainly in neuronal areas where there was prominent perivascular cuffing, severe neuronal loss, reactive gliosis and neovascularization. Focal viral inclusions/antigens/ RNA and nucleocapsids were demonstrated mainly in surviving neurons. Severe meningitis was found in many areas. Notably, vasculitis, endothelial syncytia and thrombosis seen in acute henipavirus encephalitis were absent and blood vessels were all negative for antigens/RNA. The presence of viral inclusions, nucleocapsids, antigens and RNA confirmed relapsing henipavirus encephalitis as a recurrent infection rather than postinfectious encephalitis (114) . The absence of vasculopathy and extra-CNS organ involvement suggests reactivation of latent viral foci within the CNS rather than virus reentry from an extra-CNS site.",

Although vasculopathy was invariably present, neuronal infection and encephalitis were not prominent in the ferret, pig, cat, horse and guinea pig (except in high HeV doses) models. NiV infection in mice was subclinical (28), but older mice were susceptible to HeV for reasons possibly related to interferon I response after viral entry (25) or perhaps to other host responses such as CXCL10, a chemokine induced by NiV (72) . An interesting but rare finding was neuronal syncytia formation in the hamster and chicken embryo CNS (118, 133) . In addition to vasculopathy and lung parenchyma infection seen in most animal models, the pig also showed prominent infection and syncytia formation in the bronchial epithelium (63, 133) .

So far, there has been no direct evidence for this in human infection (136) . Despite NiV strains from Bangladesh and Malaysia sharing about 91.8% genomic sequence homology (48) , the infectious disease pathology may still differ. To address this question, two separate studies using the hamster model were performed. In one study, the Malaysian strain caused a more accelerated infection (24), but in another study there were no apparent significant differences (3). A study in ferrets also showed no pathological differences except for higher viral titers in oral secretions following infection with the Malaysian strain (22). Further studies by manipulating NiV genome using a recently described infectious clone may be helpful to further understand the differences, if any, between Bangladesh and Malaysian strains (142) . The only study so far that directly compared HeV and NiV infections in an animal model (hamster) did not appear to demonstrate significant differences in the two viruses either, except for the finding that NiV initially replicated in the upper respiratory tract epithelium, whereas early HeV replication was in lung interstitium (105) .",

However, its effect on human HeV infections, if any, was uncertain (69) . Nonetheless, as it was found to have some effect on henipaviruses experimentally (36, 139) , ribavirin was further tested for its anti-henipavirus properties either alone or in combination with a potentially useful antimalarial drug called chloroquine (94) . Unfortunately, in the hamster, ferret and African green monkey models, ribavirin or ribavirin/ chloroquine combinations were found to be ineffective against infection and disease (32, 86, 104) .

In fact, on humanitarian grounds, two patients with HeV infection have been given these antibodies with no adverse effects but the antiviral effectiveness has not been verified (9). Many new vaccine candidates for active immunization using different live recombinant vaccine, subunit vaccine and virus-like particle platforms that mainly express henipavirus F and/or G proteins have been successfully developed and tested in various animal models including hamsters, pigs, cats, ferrets and African green monkeys models (6, 40, 60, 66, 77, 79, 87, 93, 96, 121, 125, 141) .
