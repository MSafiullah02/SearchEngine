Given a sequence of text passages as query, the goal is to retrieve a sequence of images that best describes and aligns with the query. This new task extends the traditional cross-modal retrieval, where each image-text pair is treated independently ignoring broader context. We propose a novel variational recurrent seq2seq (VRSS) retrieval model for this seq2seq task. Unlike most cross-modal methods, we generate an image vector corresponding to the latent topic obtained from combining the text semantics and context. This synthetic image embedding point associated with every text embedding point can then be employed for either image generation or image retrieval as desired. We evaluate the model for the application of stepwise illustration of recipes, where a sequence of relevant images are retrieved to best match the steps described in the text. To this end, we build and release a new Stepwise Recipe dataset for research purposes, containing 10K recipes (sequences of image-text pairs) having a total of 67K imagetext pairs. To our knowledge, it is the first publicly available dataset to offer rich semantic descriptions in a focused category such as food or recipes. Our model is shown to outperform several competitive and relevant baselines in the experiments. We also provide qualitative analysis of how semantically meaningful the results produced by our model are through human evaluation and comparison with relevant existing methods.",

Classical approaches to compare data across modalities include canonical correlation analysis [12] , partial least squares regression [28] , and their numerous variants. More recently, various deep learning models have been developed to learn shared embedding spaces from paired image-text data, either unsupervised, or supervised using image class labels. The deep models popularly used include deep belief networks [23] , correspondence autoencoders [9] , deep metric learning [13] , and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) [33] . With all these models it is expected that by learning from pairwise aligned data, the common representation space will capture semantic similarities across modalities.",

VRSS produces a joint representation of the image-text repository, where the semantic associations are grounded in context by making use of the sequential nature of the data. Stepwise query results are then obtained by searching this representation space. More concretely, we incorporate the global context information encoded in the entire text sequence (through the attention mechanism) into a variational autoencoder (VAE) at each time step, which converts the input text into an image representation in the image embedding space. To capture the semantics of the images retrieved so far (in a story/recipe), we assume the prior of the distribution of the topic given the text input follows the distribution conditional on the latent topic from the previous time step. By doing so, our model can naturally capture sequential semantic structure.",

For instance, an alignment model [16] was devised that learns inter-modal correspondences using MS-COCO [19] and Flickr-30k [25] datasets. Other work [18] proposed unifying joint image-text embedding models with multimodal neural language models, using an encoder-decoder pipeline. A later method [8] used hard negatives to improve their ranking loss function, which yielded significant gains in retrieval performance. Such systems focus only on isolated image retrieval when given a text query, and do not address the seq2seq retrieval problem that we study here. In a slight variation [2] , the goal was to retrieve an image-text multimodal unit when given a text query. For this, they proposed a gated neural architecture to create an embedding space from the query texts and query images along with the multimodal units that form the retrieval results set, and then performed semantic matching in this space. The training minimized structured hinge loss, and there was no sequential nature to the data used.",

We also define Story Recall@k, which considers the retrieved image as correct if it is from the same data sequence. Further, we provide Visual Saliency Recall@k values. We implement Visual Saliency Recall following [27] and train a VGG-19 network to classify the images of the story test set, with visual features from [22] for initialization. We also report Visual Feature Similarity using the average cosine similarity between gold-standard image and retrieved image, considering image features generated by [22] . Previous work [27] highlights that existing quantitative retrieval metrics may be too harsh for a task of this description. Therefore, it is imperative that we use human evaluators to judge how appropriate and coherent the retrieved illustration sequences are. For our human evaluation, we pick a random sample (164 recipes, 1564 image-text pairs) from the test set (1K recipes, 6K image-text pairs). We present each evaluator with a sequence of recipe instruction steps that make up one complete recipe. Alongside each text segment, they are given three possible illustrations that depict that step, which are randomly shuffled images of the gold-standard, the non-context model, and the proposed VRSS model. The evaluator is asked to select all image options that may be appropriate illustrations for the corresponding text segment. A total of 5.1K ratings are obtained from 12 evaluators, ensuring that every sample receives at least 2 ratings. Table 1 reports the retrieval performance of different methods using Recall@k and Story Recall@k metrics. LDA gives the worst results, which shows that using a generative model for capturing the semantic topics from both text and image does not work well in the seq2seq retrieval task. By mapping both text and image into the same embedding space, VSE++ outperforms LDA. Our VRSS model without the VAE component (VRSS-VAE) gives similar performance compared Recall@k and Story Recall@k metrics only measure the degree of exact matches of the retrieved images with regards to the gold-standard images. This might not be appropriate for our text illustration task since a given text segment could be illustrated by multiple images expressing similar semantics. Example image retrieval results are shown in Fig. 3 where both the gold-standard and the VRSS retrieved images are displayed for some recipe instructions. It can be observed that although VRSS failed to retrieve the gold-standard images in these examples, its output images are still appropriate illustrations of the corresponding texts. For this reason, we also report the evaluation results using more semantics-based and feature-based metric, Visual Saliency Recall@k.",

We only count a vote if there is majority consensus among the evaluators. Hence, in Table 2 , the '# Votes' column indicates the number that constitutes a majority among voters. In Table 2 , we see the preference results obtained from human evaluation of the retrieved recipe illustrations. Considering majority agreement as 2 votes, gold-standard was never preferred in isolation. Rather, in 61% of the cases, both the gold-standard image and the image retrieved using VRSS were deemed to be appropriate illustrations for the given text query. In 18% of the cases, gold-standard as well as the retrieved images from both models were considered appropriate. In the remaining 21% of the cases, the VRSS output was not judged as being appropriate. Taking 3 votes as the majority, gold-standard alone was picked in 88% of the cases, and picked in combination with the VRSS output in 8% of the remaining cases, with a negligible number of cases for the other combinations. Where the majority consensus is above 4 votes, evaluators chose gold-standard alone in every case. Therefore, VRSS outperforms other models particularly in ambiguous cases where the text is likely to contain an indirect description of the image. The VRSS output is about 3 times more likely to be selected compared to the VSE++ output. Over 60% of the time, at least 2 human evaluators believe that the VRSS output is as appropriate as the gold-standard image. These results indicate that the context based VRSS model significantly outperforms the non-context based model. Figure 3 shows examples where the VRSS output was preferred by human evaluators. It also highlights cases where metrics other than recall are beneficial such as semantically related entities and paired images having Visual Feature Similarity. The last text segment implicitly refers to the previous, with this retrieved image counted favourably when using the context-aware Story Recall metric. We also perform a qualitative error analysis, and find that the attention mechanism sometimes misdirects the image retrieval (Figs. 4 and 5). ",
