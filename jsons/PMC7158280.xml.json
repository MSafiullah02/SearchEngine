            "text": "\nLectins are an important class of proteins or glycoproteins of non-immune origin that bind non-covalently to characteristic carbohydrate structures with specificity or selectivity. There are many ways to classify lectins. Given the fact that a wide range of living organisms, from microbes to mammals, produce lectins, they can be divided according to species origin, such as microbial lectins, plant lectins, invertebrate lectins and vertebrate lectins. Based on the similarities in sequence of homology and activity, lectins can also be grouped into subfamilies. There are at least five groups of vertebrate lectins, such as C-type (calcium dependent), P-type, S-type, I-type, and pentraxins [1]. Cellular lectin molecules or receptors with lectin-like carbohydrate-binding domains play important roles in cell signaling, protein intracellular trafficking, and cell\u2013cell communication [2], [3], [4], [5].",

            "text": "Lectins can also be classified according to their binding specificity or selectivity with carbohydrates. This type of classification is helpful for selection of lectins as structural probes in biomedical applications. By the early seventies, the carbohydrate-binding activity of a lectin was commonly described in terms of monosaccharide specificity. Experimentally, a type of inhibition assay, such as agglutination inhibition, was performed to identify the monosaccharide that most effectively inhibited the binding reaction. Many lectins are able to cross-react with a panel of sugar chains with a common terminal sugar residue. Lately, disaccharides are considered to be a better way to define a lectin's specificity. However, some lectin-binding sites accommodate glyco-epitopes larger than mono- and disaccharides and recognize conformational epitopes. The latter may consist of much longer oligosaccharide or polysaccharide chains. There is also evidence that lectins recognize certain cluster configurations of complex carbohydrates with high selectivity and avidity.",

Aromatic amino acid residues appear frequently in carbohydrate-binding sites of various fine specificities. Such residues are large and participate in a wide variety of van der Waals and electrostatic interactions. The majority of crystal structures so far resolved are associated with a network of H-bonds, frequently with water molecules, in their combining sites. Such bound water molecules play important roles at the contacting interface between carbohydrate ligands and receptors. In addition, polyamphiphilic surfaces were identified in the interfaces of a number of carbohydrate ligands and binding sites. Presence of relatively rigid structures is required to produce an amphiphilic surface in solution. Carbohydrate molecules with branched termini, such as many blood group substances, which are formed by oligosaccharide chains, are favorable for the generation of such contact surfaces.",

            "text": "Glycoproteins and glycosphingolipids contain many carbohydrate epitopes or crypto-glyco-epitopes of biomedical importance. They are present on the cell surface and function as receptors in various life processes. Many known glyco-epitopes exist in soluble or gel form and serve as biological lubricants or as barriers against microbial invasion. During the past decade, 11 mammalian structural units have been used to express the binding domain of Gal- and GalNAc-specific lectins. They are F, GalNAc\u03b11\u21923GalNAc; A, GalNAc\u03b11\u21923Gal; T, Gal\u03b21\u21923GalNAc; I, Gal\u03b21\u21923GlcNAc; II, Gal\u03b21\u21924GlcNAc; B, Gal\u03b11\u21923Gal; E, Gal\u03b11\u21924Gal; L, Gal\u03b21\u21924Glc; P, GalNAc\u03b21\u21923Gal; S, GalNAc\u03b21\u21924Gal and Tn, GalNAc\u03b11\u2192Ser(Thr) (Fig. 1\nand Table 1\n). Except L and P, all of the units can be found in glycoproteins. Tn, which is an important marker for breast/colon cancer and vaccine development, exists only in O-glycans. Natural Tn glycoprotein, the simplest mammalian O-glycan, is exclusively expressed in the armadillo salivary gland. Antifreeze glycoprotein is composed of repeating units of T. Pneumococcus type 14 capsular polysaccharide, which has uniform II disaccharide as carbohydrate side chains. Asialo human \u03b11-acid glycoprotein and asialo fetuin provide multi-antennary II structures. Human ovarian cyst glycoproteins, which belong to the complex type of glycoform, comprise most of the structural units. To facilitate the selection of lectins that could serve as structural probes, the carbohydrate-binding properties of Gal/GalNAc-reactive lectins have been classified according to their highest affinity for structural units and their binding profiles are expressed in decreasing order of reactivity. The source and the structural relationship of the proposed mammalian structural units (lectin determinants) for Gal- and GalNAc-specific lectins, which are shown in Fig.1 as part of carbohydrate structures, are shown in Fig. 2\nand Table 1. Most of the lectin F\n\u03b2 and T\n\u03b2 determinants are found in glycosphingolipids [12], [13], [14], and the other determinants are present in mammalian glycoproteins [9, [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], especially in the human blood group A, B, H, Lea, Leb, and Ii active glycoproteins prepared from human ovarian cyst fluid [15, 18] and salivary glycoproteins [20]. The reactivities of lectin determinants represent a combined result of the binding of individual sugars. The contribution of each sugar to the binding is not necessarily equal, and is different among lectins, for example, both Amaranthus caudatus (ACL) and PNA are Gal\u03b21\u21923GalNAc specific [8, 21]. However, the inhibitory profile of the monosaccharides with these two lectins is quite different;\nGalNAc>>>Gal (inactive) in ACL and Gal>>GalNAc (poor) in PNA. Both RCA120 and WGAs are Gal\u03b21\u21924GlcNAc\u03b21\u21926 specific, and the inhibitory profile of the monosaccharide residues with these two lectins is also very different: Gal>>>GlcNAc in RCA120 and GlcNAc\u03b21\u2192 >> Gal in wheat germ [8, 9]. From the data available, expressions of the Gal/GalNAc-specific lectins based on mammalian structural units [8], [9], [10], [11], [22], [23], [24] are shown in Table 2\n.",

Effect of polyvalencies of glyco-epitopes on the binding of a lectin from the edible mushroom, Agaricus bisporus\n[27] is another important example, in which the disaccharide II monomer and tri-antennary Gal\u03b21-4GlcNAc (Tri-II) glycopeptides, the major carbohydrate side chains of Pneumococcus type 14 ps, asialo fetuin and asialo human \u03b11-acid glycoprotein, were poor inhibitors, while their polyvalent carriers were very active, implying that there are other more complicated structural factors involved in binding besides the multi-antennary II sequences. To explain this phenomenon, the present concept of glycoside cluster effect has to be further defined and classified into two groups \u2013 (a) the \u201cMulti-antennary or simple glycoside cluster effect\u201d as in galactosides with hepatic lectin\n[25, 26] and tri-antennary II with a galectin from chicken liver (CG-16) [28] as well as (b) the \u201cHigh-density polyvalent or complex glycoside cluster effect\u201d as in macromolecular interaction of high-density II cluster containing glycoproteins (Pneumococcus type 14 ps and asialo human \u03b11-acid glycoproteins) with ABA. The clustered glyco-epitopes present on macromolecules generate a great enhancement in affinity with ABA up to 4.7 \u00d7 106 times as compared to their monomeric counterparts, and demonstrate the structural importance of complex carbohydrates.",

Recent advances in characterization, cloning, and structural analysis have allowed us to classify plant lectins into seven families of structurally and evolutionarily related proteins. Within each lectin family the overall profile and structure of the carbohydrate-binding site(s) are conserved. A closer examination of the carbohydrate specificity further indicates that most plant lectins are not targeted against plant carbohydrates but preferentially bind foreign glycans [36, 37]. Establishing the relationship between the amino acid sequences of the combining sites of plant lectins and mammalian glyco-epitopes should be an important direction to be addressed in lectinology.",

Both A and B subunits are likely responsible for the binding to the terminal Gal in B, T, I, and i glyco-epitopes. However, this preparation of GS-I has no binding to cyst 9 (blood group A/location B4) and Hog4 (blood group A/location D4). This is unexpected given that its A subunit is specific for the A-glyco-epitopes. It is also not clear why this lectin is strongly reactive with asialo-OSM that displays T-glyco-epitopes but is completely negative to T-HAS. A possible interpretation of this result is that asialo-OSM displays the T-glyco-epitopes in a specific cluster configuration that substantially facilitates the binding to GS-I. By contrast, the T-glyco-epitopes of T-HAS are in the unfavorable configuration for GS-I. It is important to further characterize the specificities of individual GS-I isolectins (A4, A1B3, A2B2, A3B1, and B4).

This antibody is specific for a unique cluster of sugar chains displayed by the gp120 glycoprotein of HIV-1 [57]. It is, therefore, important to examine whether naturally occurring SARS\u2013CoV expresses the Tri-II or mII-type autoimmune reactive sugar moieties. During SARS epidemic, the viruses replicate in human cells. Their sugar chain expression may differ from the monkey cell produced viral particles. Scanning of the serum antibodies of SARS patients using glycan arrays or other specific immunologic tools may provide information that can shed light on this question.",

It is our prediction that microarray-based broad-range binding assays may substantially extend the scope of current carbohydrate research, including lectin characterization and classification. We have described here a practical platform of carbohydrate microarrays and discussed a few examples to illustrate the application of this technology in lectin characterization. We also present an integrated experimental strategy to facilitate the identification of the glyco-epitopes in biological systems, such as a newly emerged viral pathogen, SARS\u2013CoV. This research strategy is likely applicable for the exploration of complex carbohydrates that are differentially expressed by host cells, including human cancers and stem cells at various stages of differentiation.",

Lectin F determinant is found in glycosphingolipid (the principal glycolipid of mammalian tissues) of the tissues of the guinea pig, horse, cat, and chicken. It can also be found on the surface of some bacteria, viruses, human gastric carcinoma, and colon tumors [14, 15, 18, 38]. All (F, A/Ah, B, I/II, T, Tn) determinants are found in human blood groups A, B, H, Lea, Leb, and Ii active glycoconjugates prepared from human ovarian cyst fluid (HOC) [16, 18, 22, 42]. The Gal\u03b21\u21923GalNAc group at the non-reducing end of asialo-GM1 is also considered as a lectin T\u03b2 determinant. Determinants of lectins I and II discussed in this article are equivalent to human blood group type I (Lacto-N-biose, Gal\u03b21\u21923GlcNAc) and type II (N-acetyllactosamine) carbohydrate sequences [39]. S determinant is found in human Tamm-Horsfall glycoprotein (THGP) and GM2. (a) A, B, Ah, F\u03b1, T\u03b1 and Tn structural units of human ovarian cyst (HOC); (b) Asialo Sd(a+) THGP; (c) Tri-antennary II and T units of asialo fetuin. It has three oligosaccharide side chains with two different structures O-glycosidically linked to Ser or Thr of the protein core as well as three carbohydrate side chains per molecule N-glycosidically linked to asparagine. Asialo-carbohydrate chains of fetuin are shown as above [40, 41]. C: Chitin disaccharide. (d) Representative carbohydrate chains of blood group glycoprotein from human ovarian cyst fluids. The four-branched internal structure (I\u2013IV) shown is the representative internal portion of the carbohydrate moiety of blood group substances to which the residues responsible for A, B, H, Lea, and Leb activities are attached. This structure represents precursor blood group active glycoproteins [16] and can be prepared by Smith degradation of A, B, H active glycoproteins, purified from human ovarian cyst fluids. Numbers in parentheses indicate the site of attachment for the human blood group A, B, H, Lea, and Leb determinants. These determinants as well as the structural units at the non-reducing end are the sources of lectin A/Ah, B/Bh, I/II, T, and Tn determinants in (a) [9]. A megalosaccharide of 24 sugars has not been isolated. However, most of the carbohydrate chains isolated are parts of this structure.",
