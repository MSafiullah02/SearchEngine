The global production of poultry meat and eggs is around 100 and 73 million tons, respectively. The poultry industry has a significant impact on the economy. For example, this industry, including farming and processing, contributes around $7 billion to Canada\u2019s gross domestic product, which demonstrates its importance. However, the poultry industry is constantly at the risk of infectious diseases, including viral infections. Viral infections are major concerns in the poultry industry worldwide, causing drastic economic losses. Some high-priority, economically important poultry viruses, such as the avian influenza virus cause enormous socio\u2010economic impacts on public health. The expanding of both human and livestock populations, changes in the farming system with the goal of increasing production and financial benefit, the globalization of livestock farming increase the chance of the occurrence of emerging infectious disease and their spread. Therefore, there is a vital need to gain a better understanding of sources and causes regarding the emergence and spread of viral infections in poultry which will improve our strategies to control their spread and possible intra-species transmission.",

Avian influenza virus (AIV) is an enveloped, negative-sense single-stranded segmented RNA virus in the family of Orthomyxoviridae type A influenzas [1]. Based on clinical signs in chickens, AIVs have been classified into two pathotypes: highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses and low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) viruses [2]. Among 18HA subtypes of AIVs, only the H5 and H7 subtypes evolve into a highly pathogenic form of the disease. HPAI viruses cause severe outbreaks and mortality in chickens, whereas LPAI viruses usually cause mild respiratory disease [3]. The outbreaks cause a decline in the production and slaughter of birds. Enhanced biosecurity measures, surveillance, stamping out, and quarantine of infected and contact chickens are the cornerstone measures for control of AIV. AIV infected poultry can also represent a source of human infections depending on the subtype of AIV [4].",

It is a highly contagious pathogen with geographically distinct strains [5]. In chickens, the virus is transmitted mainly through aerosols and ingestion of feces or contaminated water and feed. The resulting disease, infectious bronchitis (IB), is predominantly mild-severe respiratory disease. Furthermore, the virus can infect the other part of the respiratory system, including the lung and air sacs. Then, depending on the virus strain, the virus can be found in other epithelial cells, such as oviduct and kidney epithelial cells, and causes the infection in other tissues. Some of these strains, including variant D388, known as QX genotype, or the Massachusetts (Mass) serotype cause pathological lesions in chicken oviducts, which leads to cystic oviduct formation in young pullets and subsequently false layer syndrome in the peak of production [6], [7], [8].",

In conjunction with the research efforts focused on developing effective vaccines and prophylactic strategies, there is a need to explore novel approaches to tailor favorable host innate responses, as a part of a strategy to induce rapid innate antiviral responses against viral infections. The induction of effective innate antiviral responses in chickens is a new strategy that recently gained increasing attention. Innate responses provide the first line of defence against invading viruses. To induce proper innate antiviral responses, it becomes of necessity to have a better understanding of the intracellular pathways which are triggered by the viruses. Chicken airway epithelial cells are the primary target of respiratory viral infections that play a significant role in the induction and coordination of the innate responses. These cells build a barrier as the first line of defense by isolating the lumen, and luminal surfaces from basolateral surfaces. Chicken tracheal epithelial cells are able to induce antiviral responses against viral infections and affect the functions of neighboring cells, such as macrophages. The cross-talk between different host cells directs the immune responses and the outcome of the infection. Therefore, inducing suitable responses could be a potent and efficacious strategy to induce host innate responses [9]. There are some pieces of evidence that AIV can replicate in chicken tracheal epithelial cells with increasing virus titer in a short period of time, demonstrating the susceptibility of tracheal epithelial cells to AIV infection [9], [10], [11]. Innate antiviral responses against viruses include the sensing of viral proteins and nucleic acids, production of cytokines, and chemokines [12]. Some components of innate antiviral responses against AIV and IBV are described in this review (see Fig. 1\n).",

Mucin is a heterogeneous glycoprotein produced by different types of airway epithelial cells, such as basal cells, goblet cells, and ciliated cells. Two types of mucin are present in the respiratory system; a secreted form (for example MUC5AC and MUC5B) and a form present on the cell surface acting as a receptor (for example, MUC1, MUC4, MUC11, MUC13) [13], [14].

In humans, cDCs are present beneath epithelial cells and above the basal membrane. DCs play a vital role in the initiation phase of immune responses to influenza virus infection and can recognize virions and debris of infected cells. Following the sensing or capturing of viral antigens by cDCs, these DCs migrate to lymph nodes in a CCR7-dependent manner to present the viral epitopes to CD4 + T cells via major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II [16], [21]. Moreover, DCs also present viral epitopes to CD8 + T cells via cross-presentation [22]. The activity of cytotoxic CD8 + T cells is crucial to eliminate influenza virus infection. Transportation of viral antigens from the site of infection to draining lymph nodes by DCs influences the activation of T cell subsets. CD103 + DCs are resistant to influenza virus infection. Therefore their existence is critical for the transportation of viral antigens. It has been shown that the expression of interferon-induced transmembrane protein (IFITM)3 in CD103 + DCs ensures their resistance to influenza virus infection [23]. However, some tissue-resident DCs are susceptible to influenza virus infection. As a result, they cannot migrate to lymph nodes to present viral epitopes to T cells. In the virus-infected DCs, inflammasome and caspase-1 are activated following the infection, leading to the production of interleukin (IL) \u22121 beta, and induction of pyroptosis. Pyroptosis is a form of host cell death triggered by various stimuli, including infection with pathogens and activation of the inflammasome and caspase 1 pathway [24]. Following IL-1 production, other DCs which are known as bystander DCs, move toward the site of infection to capture virus particles and migrate to lymph nodes [25].",

In fact, the hemagglutinin glycoprotein binds to the host cell surface depending on the presence of specific sialic acid moieties on host cells. As a result, the viral hemagglutinin glycoprotein affects the host range of different influenza viruses and is known as a determinant of host susceptibility. Changes in the amino acid sequence of hemagglutinin affect the sialic acid receptor specificity and pathogenicity of the virus [33]. The HA of human origin viruses commonly binds to SA moieties with \u03b12,6 linkages, while the HA of avian origin viruses commonly binds to SA moieties with \u03b12,3 linkages. In addition, the patterns of \u03b12,3 and \u03b12,6 sialic acid expression differ in a variety of mammalian and avian species [34], [35], [36]. In humans, tracheal epithelial cells primarily contain SA moieties with \u03b12,6 linkages, whereas the tracheal epithelium in chickens and pigs expresses both SA moieties with \u03b12,6 and \u03b12,3 linkages [35], [36], [37]. However, the expression pattern of SA moieties is varying among different cells of the epithelium in chickens. For example, chicken tracheal ciliated cells mostly express \u03b12,3-linked SA, while \u03b12,6-linked SA is expressed in goblet cells. Basal cells express both \u03b12,3-linked SA and \u03b12,6-linked SA [11].",

Previous studies demonstrated that the activation of cells with different PAPMs leads to the up-regulation of TLR2. Stimulation of TLR2 with its cognate ligands results in the induction of intracellular signaling pathways and the initiation of the innate responses, which interfere with the replication of pathogens within host cells. Several studies in chickens using in vitro, in ovo, or in vivo models demonstrated the induction of antiviral responses following TLR2 stimulation in chickens. The activations of TLR2 with Pam3CSK4, TLR2 ligand, results in the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Increased expression of IL-1\u03b2 in macrophages induced with Pam3CSk4 has been coinciding with the reduction in AIV replication [50]. In addition, enhanced expression of IL-1\u03b2 was observed in chicken tracheal cells following TLR2 ligand treatment. IL-1\u03b2 can induce NO synthesis, the proliferation of T and B cells and recruitment of lymphocytes, macrophages, and heterophils and finally can inhibit the spread of infection in the host [53]. Activations of TLR2 with Pam3CSK4 enhances the expression of interferon regulatory transcription factor (IRF)1, IRF7, type I interferons (IFNs), IFN-\u0263, and the interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). In chickens, IRFs involve in antiviral responses by the regulation of interferon responses. Pam3CSK4 is able to induce a wide array of ISGs in chickens, including 2\u2032-5\u2032-oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS) and interferon-induced transmembrane protein (IFITM)5, protein kinase R (PKR) and viperin. The induction of type I IFN and ISG expression following TLR ligand stimulation can limit AIV shedding from infected chickens since IFNs and ISGs play an essential role in interfering with AIV infection. Barjesteh et al. demonstrated that the pre-stimulation of macrophages with Pam3CSk4 reduces H4N6 AIV replication [50]. In chickens, intranasal, and intramuscular administration of TLR2 ligand, significantly reduces oral and cloacal AIV shedding. The intranasal treatment of Pam3CSK4 is more effective than the intramuscular administration. In chickens, intranasal treatment with Pam3CSk4 results in the up-regulation of IFN-\u03b2 and ISGs (PKR, viperin, and melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5) in trachea and down-regulation of IFN-\u03b2 and viperin and up-regulation of PKR and MDA5 in cecal tonsils. These data suggested that intranasal treatment may locally stimulate respiratory epithelial cells to induce antiviral responses and subsequently limit AIV replication [47].",

The anti-influenza property of poly I:C may be attributed to the unique signaling pathway utilized by TLR3, which signals solely through the TIR domain-containing adaptor inducing IFN-\u03b2 (TRIF) pathway and promotes the production of type I IFNs, IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2 [55], [56]. Barjesteh et al. indicated that treatment of chicken tracheal epithelial cells (cTECs) with polyI:C reduces the replication of AIV in cTECs [9]. In contrast, BX795 and celastrol, inhibitors of IRF7 and nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-kB) pathways, increase AIV replication in polyI:C treated cells demonstrating the role of IRF7 and NF-kB signaling pathways in the induction of antiviral responses post TLR3 stimulation. PolyI:C induces IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 and IL-8 expression in cTECs [57]. The induction of pro-inflammatory responses in cTECs through the NF-\u03baB pathway following polyI:C treatment can recruit macrophages to the site of infection. The chemotactic effects of supernatants from cTECs treated with polyI:C on chicken macrophages, indicated increased macrophage migration toward TEC supernatants. In addition, it has been demonstrated that supernatants from cTECs treated with TLR ligands can contain IFNs, ISGs or other active antiviral components that interfere with AIV replication in other host cells, such as chicken macrophages [9]. Moreover, Ahmed-Hassan et al. showed that in ovo treatment of eggs with dsRNA activates the innate responses against H4N6 LPAIV infection through increasing TLR3 expression and type I IFN production as well as macrophage recruitment. In addition, dsRNA elicits antiviral responses against LPAIV correlating with type I IFN activity in macrophages in vitro\n[4]\n.\n",

            "text": "TLR4 is expressed in most chicken cells, including macrophages, heterophils, B cells, as well as in tissues including the trachea, the spleen, and bursa of Fabricius [58], [59]. Bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is the main component of the outer wall of all gram-negative bacteria which is recognized by TLR4. TLR4 on the surface of cells interacts with three different extracellular proteins: LPS binding protein (LBP), CD14 and, myeloid differentiation protein 2 (MD-2) [60]. TLR4 ligand activates two downstream intracellular signaling routes: myeloid differentiation primary response gene (MyD88) dependent and independent pathways in chicken macrophages [61]. Prophylactic treatment of chickens with LPS, TLR4 ligand, prior to influenza virus infection, significantly reduces virus shedding and has the ability to increase host immunity against AIV [55], [62]. Barjesteh et al. demonstrated that treatment of chickens with LPS prior to AIV infection reduces AIV shedding. LPS from Escherichia coli 026:B6 reduces cloacal virus shedding and both low and high doses of LPS could significantly reduce oral shedding of H4N6 AIV. Moreover, TLR4 ligand induces the expression of genes involved in antiviral responses such as type I IFN and ISGs in the chicken trachea and cecal tonsils. The results of this study raise the possibility of treatment of chickens with LPS as antiviral agents [47]. Moreover, pre-treatment of macrophage by LPS showed a significant reduction in H4N6 AIV replication. The study revealed that LPS can activate macrophages and increase in expression of IL-1\u03b2 and IFN-\u0263 in stimulated macrophages concurrent with the reduction in viral replication. It is assumed that this reduction is mediated by reinforcement of macrophages antiviral responses, and TLR4 ligand may interfere with AIV replication through IFNs induction [50]. It is discovered that the treatment of embryonated chicken eggs with LPS reduces AIV infection. Following embryonic treatment, the expression of IL-1\u03b2 increases in the chorioallantoic membrane (CAM), which may recruit other cells, such as macrophages, to the site of infection. In addition, the expression of IFN-\u0263 is upregulated after TLR4 ligand treatment in CAM, which may play a role in the reduction of the AIV titer [63]. However, the direct antiviral activity of IFN-\u0263 against AIV in chickens has not been characterized. In addition, cTECs treated with LPS show a reduction in replication of AIV. The blockage of IRF7 pathway with BX795 in LPS treated cTECs, results in increased AIV replication, indicating that IRF7 pathway plays a significant role in induction of antiviral response through TLR4 ligand stimulation [57]. Furthermore, treated cells with TLR4 influence the functions of neighboring cells. For example, Barjesteh et al. demonstrated the effects of supernatants of tracheal cells treated with LPS on macrophages. These cells can activate macrophages and increase the production of NO by chicken macrophages [49]. In addition, treated cells with TLR4 liagand are able to communicate with chicken macrophages in which co-culture of treated tracheal cells with macrophages results in the limitation of AIV in macrophages [9], [57].",

Activation of this pathway leads to the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL) 1\u03b2 and IL-6 [64], [65]. Stewart et al. demonstrated the antiviral properties of the TLR7 ligand, loxoribine, in chickens demonstrating its antiviral properties of loxoribine. The treatment of primary chicken splenocytes with loxoribine resulted in the induction of interferons-\u03b1, -\u03b2, and -\u0263, and ISGs including PKR and Mx [48]. Additionally, resiquimod, a TLR7 ligand can increase IL-1\u03b2 production in chicken macrophages, which leads to stimulation of antiviral responses against AIV. The induction of antiviral response against AIV by TLR7 ligands is attributable to IL-1\u03b2 production and not to the NO production [66]. In addition, after treatment of embryonated chicken eggs with R848, a TLR7 ligand, IL-1\u03b2 is upregulated in CAM, which may recruit macrophages to the CAM. This recruitment may be the source of iNOS in the CAM and the cause of the inhibition in AIV replication [63]. R848 has been used in vivo in chickens resulting in a significant reduction of cloacal and orad AIV shedding [47].",

CpG oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) acts as a potent immunomodulatory agent in chickens by inducing innate responses against pathogens. CpG ODNs can be used for the stimulation of the TLR21 signaling pathway in chickens resulting in the up-regulation of mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and the recruitment cells of the innate system, such as macrophages [68]. Recently, the in ovo delivery of CpG ODNs was shown to protect chickens against many bacterial and viral infections by activating the TLR21 signaling pathway. This pathway resulted in increased recruitment of macrophages, a cluster of differentiation (CD)8\u03b1+ and CD4+T lymphocytes, and an up-regulation of interferon (IFN)-\u03b3 mRNA in the respiratory tract of the chickens [69]. In a previous study, chicken embryos were inoculated with CpG ODN and challenged with virulent IBV. The results showed that there was a significant differential up-regulation of IFN-\u03b3, IL-8 (CXCLi2) and macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1\u03b2 genes and suppression of IL-6 gene expression being associated with inhibition of IBV replication in pre-treated lungs tissue retrieved from embryos [70]. In addition, the transcriptional analysis revealed that CpG ODN is able to induce the expression of IL- 1\u03b2, IFN-\u03b3, IRF7, and IFN-\u03b2 in macrophages, which might play a role in control in viral replication in these cells [50]. The delivery of CpG ODNs in ovo in chickens before hatching day significantly reduces H4N6 AIV replication in the chicken lungs after they hatch [69]. These reductions are associated with enhanced NO production and macrophage recruitment [69]. Furthermore, the treatment of embryonated eggs treated with CpG ODNs leads to the reduction of AIV replication in embryonated eggs which can be correlated with the induction of type I IFNs and ISGs, such as OAS and IFITM5 in CAM [63].",

Barjesteh et al. showed the ability of CpG ODNs to induce antiviral responses in chicken macrophages with an increase in the expression of IRF1 and IRF7 genes, type I and II interferons and ISGs, such as 2\u2032-5\u2032 OAS. In macrophages stimulated with CpG DNA, reduction of AIV titer was detected, which was correlated with the up-regulation of IL-1\u03b2 and IFN-\u0263. CpG ODN can be used prophylactically in chickens to enhance host immunity against AIV [50]. Intramuscular injections of either low or high doses of the TLR ligands CpG ODN leads to a reduction in virus shedding. It is suggested that this reduction is mediated by the induction of type I IFNs, ISGs and IFN-\u0263. However, different classes of CpG ODNs have varying effects on chickens [50]. Chicken macrophages respond differently to different types of CpG ODNs in a sequence-specific manner [70]. The administration of different classes of CpG ODNs results in different levels of induced antiviral responses in chickens. The class B CpG ODNs, including 2007 and 1826 are more effective in reducing viral shedding from infected chickens than class A (2216) or class C (2395) CpG ODNs [47]. Consequently, different degrees of antiviral effects within class B CpG (2007 and 1826) were observed in which CpG 1826 is more efficacious to induce antiviral responses compared to CpG 2007 [47].",

TLR 2, 3, 4, 5 and 21 ligands have been shown to be efficacious adjuvants for AIV vaccines in chickens [71], [72]. PolyI:C and CpG combination adjuvant enhances antibody-mediated and cell-mediated immune responses against AIV antigens. A possible mechanism may be attributed in part to the synergistic IFN-\u0263 response in chicken monocytes stimulated with poly I:C and CpG combinations. PolyI:C and CpG adjuvants may result in the synergistic induction of IFN-\u0263 upon acting directly on tissue-resident macrophages and dendritic cells soon after immunization. Moreover, polyI:C and CpG ODN combination adjuvant can promote the induction of a robust T-cell response [72]. The induction of T-cell responses is highly desired in an AIV vaccine, as effector T-cells have been shown to protect the host against lethal H5N1 AIV infections in chickens [73]. Therefore, polyI:C and CpG ODN combination adjuvant improves the efficacy of the inactivated whole virus AIV vaccines by enhancing T-cell mediated responses [72].",

Despite the lack of RIG-I in chickens, MDA5 compensates for the missing gene [42]. However, a previous study suggested that the lack of RIG-I in chickens leads to inefficient antiviral innate immune response induced by this pathway [80]. In contrast, Liniger et al. showed that MDA5 functionally responsible for sensing AIV in the absence of RIG-I. In addition, it has been revealed that chicken LGP2 is a positive regulator of MDA5 signaling, similarly to those in the mammalian RLR pathway [78]. There seems to be contrary evidence that the lack of RIG-1 in chickens does not affect the susceptibility of chicken to AIV infection. Chicken MDA5 (chMDA5) expression is upregulated in response to influenza infection and following IFN activation of cells, but knockdown of chMDA5 expression does not appear to impact influenza virus replication.",

Activated MAVS can recruit downstream IRF7 and NF-\u03baB, leading to the rapid production of type I IFNs and pro-inflammatory cytokines.

In the absent of RIG-I in chickens, STING plays a critical role in the induction of type I IFNS in chickens. Chicken STING is able to interact with chicken MDA5 and it may have a role in MDA5 signaling in chickens [88].",

Rohaim et al. suggested that the stable expression of chIFIT5 alone is insufficient to provide protection against HPAIV, but improves the clinical symptoms [113]. Recently, it is demonstrated that the chIFIT5 gene is responsive to both type I IFNs (IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2) and AIV infection. In addition, chIFIT5 can specifically antagonize with negative-sense viral RNA structures carrying 5\u2032-ppp portion. A previous study in chickens demonstrated the interaction between AIV and IFIT5 and subsequent reduction of AIV replication by using a lentivirus-mediated IFIT5-stable chicken fibroblast model [110]. Furthermore, the kinetics of AIV replication in transgenic chicken embryos (expressing chIFIT5 protein or knocked-down for endogenous chIFIT5 gene) showed the potential antiviral activity of chIFIT5 against AIV in ovo\n[110]. Infection of different chicken tissues (liver, kidney, spleen, beak, trachea, lungs, and duodenum) with H9N2 avian influenza virus strain showed higher levels of chIFIT5 expression and it seems that AIV infection positively regulates the transcriptional dynamics of chIFIT5 in chickens [110].",

            "text": "IFITM family is known to have a critical role in limiting AIV infection in chickens [114], [115]. Clustering of gene expression profiles in chickens suggests that IFITM1 and 2 have an antiviral response and IFITM3 may act prior to viral membrane fusion and thus blocks viral entrance [114]. In physiological status, IFIRM5 is the main expressed IFITM in different embryonic and adult organs in chickens, except for the colon in which IFITM1 and 3 are the main expressed IFITMs. However, a previous study in chickens demonstrated the significant expression of IFITM5 in CAM of embryonated eggs following the treatment with TLR2, 4 and 7 ligands. The expression of IFITM3 is increased following IBV infection in chickens [116]. The expression of IFITM3 is significantly increased in the lung of infected chickens with AIV [117]. IFITM3 is a viral restriction factor, which targets influenza A virus entry process in humans by blocking complete virus envelope fusion with cell endosome membranes [115], [118]. It has been suggested that the chicken IFITM3 protein protect host cells from infection with AIV to a similar level as its human orthologue and in vitro experiments showed the anti-influenza activity of IFITM3 in chicken cells [114]. Barjesteh et al. in vivo study demonstrated the up-regulation of IFITM5 in the chicken trachea cells following CpG ODN and Pam3CSK4 treatments [49]. In addition, IFITM3 is up-regulated in trachea after CpG treatment of chickens in vivo, which may be the reason for the largest reduction in oral AIV shedding by CpG 1826 since IFITM3 inhibits the replication of AIV in host cells by preventing viral uncoating [47], [115], [119]. Furthermore, it has been shown that HPAI H5N1 virus can induce excessive expression of IFITM5 in lung tissues of chickens. Conversely, the IFITM5 gene is down-regulated in the lung tissues following infection of chickens with LPAIV H9N2. It is suggested that this dysregulation of IFITM5 gene may contribute to the severity and the outcome of the influenza infection in chickens [120].",

Cytoplasmic human Mx interacts directly with influenza nucleoproteins (NP), while nuclear MxA blocks viral RNA transcription [127]. Mx is principally induced by type I IFN [124]. The study of Schusser et al. on chicken Mx revealed that this protein lacks GTPase activity [128]. Previously, it was suggested that GTP hydrolysis is essential for Mx antiviral function, but recent studies in chickens have shown that Mx protein is not able to induce protection against influenza and Mx lacks GTPase activity [100], [129], [130]. A weak host immune response is observed in chickens infected with HPAI H5N1 strain of AIV, in spite of the induction of IL-6, Mx, and PKR. It is suggested that the induction of the antiviral proteins PKR and Mx without an increase in type I IFNs fails to produce effective antiviral responses against HPAIVs [124].",

            "text": "2\u2032-5\u2032oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS) is an ISG protein in chickens. Activation of the classical OAS/RNase L pathway results in RNA degradation of both viral and cellular RNA, including ribosomal RNA within infected cells. Subsequently, it inhibits protein translation in these cells, which leads to effective prevention of viral genome replication [131], [132]. The expression of OAS is increased following viral infections, including IBV [96]. In addition, several studies have shown the significant mRNA expression of OAS gene following TLR ligand treatments in chickens. Previous studies demonstrated that TLR2, 4 and 21 ligands Pam3CSK4, LPS, and R848, respectively, induced the expression of some ISGs, including OAS in the CAM, trachea and cecal tonsils. In contrast, TRL21 ligand CpG ODN 1826 does not induce 2\u2032-5\u2032 OAS in the CAM [63]. Another study indicated that LPS and Pam3CSK4 significantly induce the expression of OAS in the chicken trachea and cecal tonsils. The findings of the Barjesteh et al. suggested that TLR ligands can interfere with the replication of AIV, which may be correlated with the expression of OAS [63]. In addition, it is evident that IFN-\u0263 induces nitric oxide production, macrophage cell surface markers and up-regulation of some ISGs such as 2\u2032-5\u2032 OAS. Therefore, it might be that IFN-\u0263 through the initiation of RNase L pathway, indirectly, interferes with the replication of AIV in macrophages.",

The combination of the virus replication in host tissues, and activation of the PRRs and their downstream IFNs and pro-inflammatory cytokines suggests that the chicken innate responses play a key role in the control of viral infections. The host innate responses either clear invading viruses or allows the adaptive immune system to establish an effective antiviral response. Although our knowledge about chicken innate responses against respiratory viral infections has significantly expanded in the last decade, a better understanding of cross-talk between different host cells and involved underlying mechanisms is required. Understanding the molecular mechanisms involved in the interaction between different host cells is crucial for further improvements in strategies.",

            "text": "Fig. 1: Summary of antiviral signaling pathways in chickens. Chicken antiviral responses rely on the recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). Viral double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) is detected by chicken melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5) or laboratory of genetics and physiology 2 (LGP2), which triggers downstream signaling mediated through mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS). Endosomal Toll-like receptors (TLRs), TLR3, TLR7 and TLR21 can recognize dsRNA, ssRNA and cytosine-guanosine oligodeoxynucleotides (CpG ODNs), respectively. TLR3 signals through adaptor protein TIR-domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon (TRIF) and TLR7 and 21 signal through myeloid differentiation primary response 88 (MyD88). Surface TLR2 and 4 also signal through MyD88. However, when present in the phagosome, TLR4 signals through adaptor protein TRIF and TRAM (TRIF-related adaptor molecule). These adaptor molecules then activate the transcription factors interferon regulatory factor (IRF)7 and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB), by coordinating the assembly of multi-protein complexes. Upon activation, IRF7 and NF-\u03baB induce transcription of type I interferons (IFNs), pro-inflammatory cytokines, and interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). Additionally, secreted type I IFNs can activate Janus kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription (JAK/STAT) pathway through type I IFN receptor binding. Activated JAK/STAT leads to the phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT2 molecules, results in recognition of the IFN-stimulated response element (ISRE) and transcription of ISGs. Activation of these various pathways leads to the induction of an antiviral state.
