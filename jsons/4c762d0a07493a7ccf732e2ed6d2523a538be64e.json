            "text": "Patients only tested positive for 2 of the 13 viruses (HBoV = 1, EBV = 3). This detection rate of 8% is known to be similarly low in non-CF patients indicating that the 13 viruses tested for do not frequently account for most pulmonary exacerbations in patients with CF [6, 8] . Retrospective studies report that HBoV is most prevalent in infants up to the age of 2 years [7] . It should also be borne in mind that most of respiratory virus infections occur during childhood and therefore, age may be the most important risk factor [6, 9] . Thus, as our cohort consisted of mostly adults, we cannot exclude the possibility that age effects may have biased our results. Previous investigations demonstrated a higher frequency of pulmonary exacerbations for common respiratory viruses like RSV [1, 4, 10] . In line with these results, we found that the pulmonary exacerbation frequency was significantly associated with virus positivity in this study. However, we did not detect any deterioration of the Shwachman Score or a decline of FEV1 as shown for common respiratory viruses [1, 4, 10, 11] . Moreover, our results indicate an association of virus positivity with colonization by A. fumigatus, P. aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus species (including MRSA). For other well-known respiratory viruses, an association with several of the same bacterial pathogens has been previously suggested [1, 11, 12] . A limitation is the small number of CF patients participating in our study. Further studies should clarify whether our findings reflect a non-specific colonization (HBoV) or reactivation (EBV) in an otherwise severely infected organ or if these viral infections worsen lung tissue inflammation and thus accelerate the progression of lung disease in CF. Results were partly presented at the 61st Annual Meeting of the German Society of Microbiology and Hygiene (DGHM) in G\u00f6ttingen, Germany (20-23 September 2009) [13] .",
