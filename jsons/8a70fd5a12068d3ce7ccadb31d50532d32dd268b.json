This dramatically highlights the need for specific medical countermeasures to enable the authorities to protect individuals from a future bioterrorism attack.",

[5] , Craft et al. [6] , Kaplan et al. [7, 8] , Mu and Shen [9] , Hiroyuki et al. [10] , Tadahiro et al. [11] , Michael et al. [12] . Various mathematical models have been proposed to analyze and study the general characteristics of each epidemic, such as SI, SIR, SIS, SIRS, SEI, SEIR, and others. It is worth mentioning that the major purpose of these articles is to compare the performance of the following two strategies, the traced vaccination (TV) strategy and the mass vaccination (MV) strategy. Furthermore, the epidemic diffusion models which they adopted are based on the traditional compartment model, while the complex topological structure of the social contact network is not considered.",

            "text": "As is well known, a class of network with a topology interpolating between that of lattices and random graphs is proposed by Watts and Strogatz [13] . In these models, a fraction of the links of the lattice is randomized by connecting nodes, with probability p, with any other node. For a range of p the network exhibits 'small world' behavior, where a local neighborhood (as in lattices) coexists with a short average path length (as in random graphs). Analysis of real networks reveals the existence of small worlds in many interaction networks, including networks of social contacts [14] . Recently, attention has been focused on the impact of network topology on the dynamics of the processes running on it with emphasis on the spreading of infectious diseases. For many infectious diseases, a small-world network on an underlying regular lattice is a suitable simplified model for the contact structure of the host population. It is well known that the contact network plays an important role in both the short term and the long term dynamics of epidemic spread [15] . Thus, one of the major motivations for studying the complex network in this work is to better understand the structure of social contact network, because there is a natural link between the epidemiological modeling and the science of complex network. Jari and Kimmo [16] propose an SIR model for modeling the spreading process of randomly contagious diseases, such as influenza, based on a dynamic small-world network. A study by Masuda and Konno [17] presents a multi-state epidemic process based on a complex network. They analyze the steady states of various multistate disease propagation models with heterogeneous contact rates. In many models, heterogeneity simply decreases epidemic thresholds. Xu et al. [18] present a modified SIS model based on complex networks, small-world and scale-free, to study the spread of an epidemic by considering the effect of time delay. Based on twodimension small-world networks, a susceptible-infected (SI) model with epidemic alert is proposed by Han [19] . This model indicates that the broadcasting of a timely epidemic alert is helpful and necessary in the control of epidemic spreading, and is in agreement with the general view of epidemic alert. Shi et al. [20] propose a new susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) model with infective medium. The dynamic behaviors of the model on a homogeneous network and on a heterogeneous scalefree network are considered respectively. Furthermore, it is shown that the immune density of nodes depends not only on the infectivity between individual persons, but also on the infectivity between persons and mosquitoes. Zhang and Fu [21] study the spreading of epidemics on scale-free networks with infectivity which is nonlinear in the connectivity of nodes. The result shows that nonlinear infectivity is more appropriate than a constant or a linear one. With unit recovery rate and nonlinear irrational infectivity, the epidemic threshold is always positive.",

            "text": "As mentioned in Craft et al. [6] , deterrence is not a reliable strategy to against the terrorists, and it is difficult to get the biological agents out of the hands of terrorists before they attack. Our security against a biological attack rests largely on consequence management, i.e., how to ensure the availability and supply of emergency resource so that the loss of life can be minimized and the efficiency of each rescue can be maximized? Considering the relationship between an unexpected bioterror attack and the associated emergency logistics decisions, Liu and Zhao [22] focus on how to deliver emergency resources to the epidemic areas when a bioterror attack is suffered, and propose a mixed-collaborative distribution model for the emergency resources distribution based on the epidemic diffusion rule. A very recent research effort by Wang et al. [23] constructs a multi-objective stochastic programming model with time-varying demand for the emergency logistics network based on epidemic diffusion rule. It is worth mentioning that majority of the existing studies relies on different kinds of differential equations. For instance, first-order partial differential equations are used to integrate the age structures; second-order partial differential equations are suitable when a diffusion term exists; and integral differential equations or differential equations are often used when time delay or delay factors are considered.

            "text": "The first mathematical model that could be used to describe an influenza epidemic was developed early in the 20th century by Kermack and McKendrick [26] . This model is known as the Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) model. To simulate an influenza epidemic, the model is analyzed on a computer and one infected individual (I) is introduced into a closed population where everyone is susceptible (S). Each infected individual (I) transmits influenza, with probability \u03b2, to each susceptible individual (S) they encounter. The number of susceptible individuals decreases as the incidence (i.e., the number of individuals infected per unit time) increases. At a certain point the epidemic curve peaks, and subsequently declines, because infected individuals recover and cease to transmit the virus. Only a single influenza epidemic can occur in a closed population because there is no inflow of susceptible individuals. The severity of the epidemic and the initial rate of increase depend upon the value of the Basic Reproduction Number (R 0 ). R 0 is defined as the average number of new infections that one case generates, in an entirely susceptible population, during the time they are infectious. If R 0 > 1 an epidemic will occur and if R 0 < 1 the outbreak will die out. The value of R 0 for any specific epidemic can be estimated by fitting the SIR model to incidence data collected during the initial exponential growth phase. The value of R 0 may also be calculated retroactively from the final size of the epidemic. If the SIR model is used, R 0 for influenza is equal to the infectivity/transmissibility of the strain (\u03b2) multiplied by the duration of the infectious period. Therefore once the value of R 0 has been obtained, the value of \u03b2 can be determined. The SIR model has been used as a basis for all subsequent influenza models. The simplest extension to the SIR model includes demographics; specifically, inflow and outflow of individuals into the population. Analysis of this demographic model shows that influenza epidemics can be expected to cycle, with damped oscillations, and reach a stable endemic level [27] . By modifying the basic SIR model in a variety of ways (e.g., by including seasonality [28, 29] ) influenza epidemics can be shown to have sustained cycles. The SIR model has also been extended so that it can be used to represent and/or predict the spatial dynamics of an influenza epidemic. The first spatial-temporal model of influenza was developed in the late 1960s by Rvachev [30] . He connected a series of SIR models in order to construct a network model of linked epidemics. He then modeled the geographic spread of influenza in the former Soviet Union by using travel data to estimate the degree of linkage between epidemics in major cities. In the 1980s, he and his colleagues Baroyan and Longini extended his network model and evaluated the effect of air travel on influenza pandemics [31, 32] . Since then other modeling studies have quantified the importance of air travel on geographic spread [33, 34] . For example, a recent study has modeled the potential for influenza epidemics to move through nine European cities: Amsterdam, Berlin, Budapest, Copenhagen, London, Madrid, Milan, Paris, and Stockholm. The authors estimate that, due to a high degree of connectedness through air travel, it would take less than a month for an epidemic beginning in any one of these cities to spread to the other eight [33] . Network models have also been use to understand the temporal and spatial synchrony of influenza epidemics within the United States (US) [35] .",

            "text": "As mentioned in Rachaniotis et al. [36] , a serious epidemic is a problem that tests the ability of a nation to effectively protect its population, to reduce human loss and to rapidly recover. Sometime such a problem may acquire worldwide dimensions. For example, during the period from November 2002 to August 2003, 8422 people in 29 countries were infected with SARS, 916 of them were dead at last for the effective medical resources appeared late. Other diseases, such as HIV, H1N1 can also cause significant numbers of direct infectious disease deaths. Epidemic diffusion is a typical complex dynamic system problem in Gao et al. [37] , for we don't know what kind of epidemic outbreaks, when it outbreaks, and how it diffuses. Generally, after an epidemic outbreak, public officials are faced with many critical and complex issues, the most important of which is to make certain how the epidemic diffuses so that the rescue operation efficiency maximized. Traditionally, analytical works on epidemic diffusion are concentrated on the compartmental epidemic models of ordinary differential equations [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] . In these models, the total population is divided into several independence classes and each class of individuals is closed into a compartment. The sizes of the compartments are large enough and the mixing of members is homogeneous. In other words, the models based on the differential equations are always under the assumption of both homogeneous infectivity and homogeneous connectivity of each individual. However, the traditional models do not consider the population migration among different compartments.",

            "text": "The other stream of related research to our work is on the epidemic diffusion with population migration. For instance, Hethcote [43] proposed that deterministic communicable disease models were initial value problems for a system of ordinary differential equations, and thus he considered the asymptotic stability for the equilibrium points for models involving temporary immunity, disease-related fatalities, carriers, migration, dissimilar interacting groups, and transmission by vectors. In his work, both susceptible individuals and infected individuals in each population could migrate (only equal rates were considered), which led to different equilibriums. Another model that considers two interacting populations undergoing SIS dynamics was presented in Kribs-Zaleta and Velasco-Hernandex [44] . The authors considered that the two groups may have different values for model parameters especially those dealing with vaccination. Liebovitch and Schwartz [45] proposed that classical disease models always use a mass action term as the interaction between infected and susceptible people in separate patches and they derived the equations when this interaction is a migration of people between patches. Sani and Kroese [46] formulated various mathematical control problems for HIV spread in mobile heterosexual populations. They applied the cross-entropy method to solve these highly multi-modal and non-linear optimization problems, and demonstrated the effectiveness of the method via a range of experiments and illustrated how the form of the optimal control function depends on the mathematical model used for the HIV spread. Yang et al. [47] considered SIR and SIS epidemic models with bilinear incidence and migration between two patches, where infected individuals cannot migrate from one patch to another due to medical screening. They found the thresholds classifying the global dynamics of the models in terms of the model parameters, and they obtained the global asymptotical stability of the disease free and the disease endemic equilibrium. Wolkewitz and Schumacher [48] pointed out that the main limitation of the compartmental models is that several parameters are based on uncertain expert guesses (default values) and are not estimated from the study data. Lee et al. [49] extended the SEIR model to incorporate population migration between cities and investigated the effectiveness of travel restrictions as a control against the spread of influenza.",

On the other hand, the number of infected individuals in city 1 increases at first and then decreases; while the number of infected individuals in city 2 increases gradually with time increasing. However, all the susceptible individuals and infected individuals in city 1 and city 2 tend to the fixed values when time is long enough (t > 300). Meanwhile, the limit value of the SIS epidemic diffusion model with population migration between two cities is Q 1 = (S 1 , S 2 , I 1 , I 2 ) = (2.5013 \u00d7 10 4 , 5.0025 \u00d7 10 4 , 0, 2.4961 \u00d7 10 4 ).",

According to Lemma 2.8, one can get that the number of susceptible and infected individuals will be converged at Q 2 = (S * 1 , S * 2 , I * 1 , I * 2 ) = (2.50125 \u00d7 10 4 , 5.00245\u00d710 4 , 0, 2.4963\u00d710 4 ). One can see that Q 1 is very close to Q 2 , which is not a surprise, as it is consistent with the analytical conclusion in the last section. Once an epidemic outbreak, we are more concerned with the change regularity of the infected individuals in practice. Therefore, in the following subsections, we will discuss the relationship between the key parameters and the number of the infected individuals. Figure 2 .14 demonstrates the change of the number of the infected individuals in both cities with different propagation coefficient. It is easy to know that the evolution trajectories of infected individuals in city 1 are different from that in city 2 for any certain propagation coefficient \u03b2. From Fig. 2 .14a, we can see that in the first some days, the larger \u03b2 is, the faster spread of the epidemic in city 1 is. However, from Fig. 2 .14b, we can't get the similar conclusion. Number of infected individuals in city 2 is not in direct proportion to the propagation coefficient \u03b2. It is worth mentioning that when the number of infected individuals in city 1 reach zero, the number of infected individuals in the other city is still positive when the epidemic diffusion system is stable. This is consistent with the Lemma 2.8. Similarly, if the initial conditions changed, we can also test and verify the other lemmas. informs us it is important to improve the recovery rate as much as possible when in controlling an epidemic spread. Figure 2 .16 shows the change of the number of infected individuals in both cities with different migrating-out coefficients a 1 and a 2 . According to Fig. 2 .16, one can observe that no matter in city 1 or in city 2, the evolution trajectories of the infected individuals may generate a serious change when the migratingout coefficient of susceptible individuals changed. For example, in city 1, when a 2 < a 1 (a 1 = 0.02, a 2 = 0.01 and a 1 = 0.02, a 2 = 0.015), the number of infected individual tends to be zero. However, when a 1 < a 2 (a 1 = 0.02, a 2 = 0.025 and a 1 = 0.02, a 2 = 0.03), the number of infected individuals tends to be a positive constant above 1 \u00d7 10 4 . In other words, with the increment of migrating-out coefficient in city 2, the limit number of infected individuals in city 1 may become positive from zero. The larger the migrating-out coefficient in city 2 is, the larger the limit number of infected individuals in city 1 is. Opposite to city 1, when a 2 < a 1 , the number of infected individuals in city 2 tends to be a positive constant above 1 \u00d7 10 4 . When a 1 < a 2 , the number of infected individuals is very small and tends to be zero at last. It informs us that with the increment of migrating-out coefficient in city 2, the limit number of infected individuals in city 2 may become zero from a positive value. The larger the migrating-out coefficient in city 2 is, the smaller the limit number of infected individuals in city 2 is. To summarize, decreasing the migration population in only one city is not as effective as improving the recovery rate for controlling the epidemic diffusion. However, we can find a trade-off between the migrating-out coefficients in these two cities, and hence can control the infected individuals in both cities at last.",
