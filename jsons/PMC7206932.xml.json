We extracted medication data for each patient, on the basis of the history in the electronic health record, and defined previous treatment with an antihypertensive medication as use of the medication within the preceding 18 months, provided that there was no evidence that the medication was discontinued at least 1 month before the Covid-19 test. The criteria for medication use included clinical documentation in the chart of prescribed medications. Medication lists and problem lists are updated frequently in our electronic health record by clinicians, who are routinely prompted by the system to cross-reference the medication list with pharmacy fill records and to ask patients about adherence.",

Propensity-score matching was implemented with the use of a nearest-neighbor strategy. The caliper for the matching was specified in the nearest-neighbor strategy if the unspecified approach did not result in satisfactory balance. For body-mass index, the mean value was imputed for patients with missing data. Our goal was to rule out a clinically meaningful difference in risk, which we defined a priori as an absolute difference of at least 10 percentage points in the likelihood of a positive or negative test for Covid-19 and in the likelihood of the presence or absence of severe Covid-19. Our primary analysis involved patients with hypertension. We also analyzed data from all patients, without regard to hypertension.",

As our prior distribution, we assumed a Beta (a,b) distribution, a conjugate to the binomial distribution, with both shape parameters a and b equal to 1. Because very few data are currently available, these uninformative parameters produce prior probabilities of outcomes that are distributed uniformly between 0 and 1. We estimated the difference as the median of the posterior samples, along with a 95% credible interval for the difference. Association between a medication class and an outcome was considered to be present when the 95% credible interval excluded zero. A substantial difference was considered to be present when the lower boundary of the 95% credible interval exceeded zero and the upper boundary exceeded 10 percentage points. We conducted sensitivity analyses using traditional frequentist approaches rather than Bayesian approaches and using adjusted logistic regression rather than propensity-score matching. Analyses were performed with the use of R statistical software, version 3.6.1 (with the libraries MatchIt and BayesianFirstAid).",

There was also no substantially higher risk (by \u226510 percentage points) of severe Covid-19 associated with any of the medications studied among the patients with a positive test in our cohort. In most cases, the study sample size permitted us, with a high degree of confidence, to rule out that the risk was higher \u2014 even by as little as 6 percentage points \u2014 among treated patients than among untreated patients. An effect size smaller than 10 percentage points may be of clinical interest, but we elected to report our findings now before the accrual of a larger sample in order to provide actionable information to the medical community, given the urgency and the rapid progression of the pandemic. Our findings may help to allay concerns on the part of patients and providers regarding the continued use of these agents in patients undergoing testing or receiving treatment for Covid-19.",

            "text": "Our data suggested a modestly lower likelihood of a positive test for Covid-19 among patients taking beta-blockers that was of marginal significance in an analysis that included all matched patients. This finding could be attributable to effects of beta-blockers on the expression or presentation at the cell surface of ACE2, the viral receptor for SARS-CoV-2, or residual confounding in the observational study design. To be relevant in SARS-CoV-2 infection, the effect on ACE2 would need to be present on respiratory epithelium, but relevant studies in animals or humans are limited, so this proposed mechanism remains speculative. Furthermore, we did not observe a similar effect with ACE inhibitors or ARBs, which would be expected to have similar effects on ACE2. Because beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors, and ARBs act at different points in the RAAS, their effects on the risk of Covid-19 or the severity of Covid-19 could potentially differ. Our observation of a lack of association between beta-blocker use and the likelihood of severe Covid-19 argues against an antiviral effect.",

The true sensitivity of testing remains unknown. Some patients in the cohort underwent multiple tests, which increased the likelihood of identifying disease. At this time, many persons with possible Covid-19 in New York City and elsewhere are not tested, particularly those who are not hospitalized. Thus, our study may include an overestimation of the proportion of cases of severe Covid-19. That said, it is unlikely that reduced access to testing would add systematic bias in assessment of the relation between use of antihypertensive medications and Covid-19.",

Despite propensity-score matching, there may be additional unmeasured confounders affecting our results. Propensity-score matching aims to create overall balance between comparison groups. Our confidence in the evidence from the primary Bayesian analysis is also supported by the sensitivity analyses that used frequentist methods.
