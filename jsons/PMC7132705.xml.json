Specific questions assessing knowledge of the major routes of H1N1 transmission included the following: (1) \u201cDo you think H1N1 could transmit via the airborne route?\u201d; (2) \u201cDo you think H1N1 could transmit via water?\u201d; and (3) \u201cDo you think H1N1 could transmit via body contact?\u201d with responses of \u201cagree/disagree/not sure.\u201d An indication variable (1 item/2 items/all 3 items) was created to determine the number of correct answer (agreeing with the statements) regarding knowledge of routes of H1N1 transmission. Risk perception assessment included perceived risks of H1N1 infection, perceived risks of H1N1 infection compared with the 2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) pandemic, and perceived risks of H1N1 infection compared with the 2007 H5N1 pandemic.",

The number of preventive precautions reported by the student was then recorded (0-1 item/2-3 items/4-5 items). Adopting 4-5 preventive precautions was used as the outcome in the logistic regression models to calculate the odds ratios (OR) for correct knowledge of transmission (all 3 items vs 0-2 items), as well as absolute risk perception of H1N1 infection (very high/high vs very low/low/don\u2019t know), and comparative risk perception of H1N1 infection with the 2003 SARS and 2007 H5N1 pandemics (higher vs similar/lower/don\u2019t know).

Thus, our findings are of value to those devising and evaluating strategies to combat future global pandemics. Another limitation of this study is the self-reported nature of the data.
