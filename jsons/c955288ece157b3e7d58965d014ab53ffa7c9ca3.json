As a result, traditional epidemic modelling is not possible. Using an 'SIS' model with constant force of infection into each care home (as an infectious unit rather than individuals) to model the outbreak across care homes does not explain the data well. However this is probably owing to a time varying transmission term. The spline used in the GAM above is a proxy for this mathematical form and given that SIS theory predicts a steady state of constant fraction of care homes in outbreak status we project the current trend observed into the future",

According to CQC, the number of care homes is N = 15517. 8 We find that an upper limit estimate on Q \u221e = 190/N from the two week plateau seen in the data and fit by the statistical model which we use as a worst case scenario. The recovery time of a care home is uncertain. If the generation time is taken to be 5 days 9 and 3-4 generations of disease occur with associated wait of a couple of 14 days after last observed case then T \u223c 34 is plausible meaning that P \u221e = 0\u00b741.

Additionally the route of infection importation may be higher in early stages from the community (visitors) or from cases being discharged from hospital. Indeed early on we should expect the generation of new cases to track the community outbreak. These processes should have been stopped once social distancing interventions were in place but may explain the early fast growth and the later plateau may be a sign of a change in transmission term varying over time.

Staff seem to be suffering disease at similar numbers to residents (it should be noted that the reason for staff absence is unclear in the data and may be that staff are absent for precautionary reasons or care of dependents elsewhere, rather than due to the disease directly). If staff work in multiple care homes then these high attack rates may lead to depletion of susceptible staff and so reduce transmission in time. However, recent statements from WHO suggests evidence for long lasting immunity is limited. 10 Moreover, staff interact with households and community and other care homes, so infection can be passed between care homes with staff acting as main vectors. This is not a sign that staff are being unobservant of the current severity of the situation but highlights the challenges they face and the high numbers of mild symptoms in cases.",
