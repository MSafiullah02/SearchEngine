Through its crossing species, it was found to cause a cluster of frequently severe respiratory infection cases in human population that greatly resemble the clinical manifestation of viral pneumonia.3, 4, 5 While first reports from initial investigations of this outbreak in Wuhan, China indicated that most cases are associated with wildlife animals and a seafood market where these patients had worked or visited, and the nonexistent of COVID-19 transmission between humans and if so, it could not spread easily between them.6 However, now it is clear that such spreading occurs7 and many confirmed cases were identified among contacts with patients with COVID-19 and among healthcare professionals, and most of these cases lack direct contact with this animal's market. Thus, transmission between human populations has been confirmed in china7 and many other countries8\n,\n9 and has rapidly evolved into a global health emergency as declared by World health Organization (WHO).10 As April 21st, 2020, the confirmed number of cases was 2,555,760 with about 75,254 new cases globally, and these numbers are increasing continuously around the world, with the USA emerging as the new COVID-19 hotspot.11\n",

Those include vaccine administration, such as during the H1N1 outbreak, drug distribution, health education, and providing direct patient care under exceptional conditions.13\n,\n14 Therefore, ensuring sufficient knowledge and awareness of pandemics among pharmacists, in addition to recognizing factors shaping their risk perceptions and communication practices, are vital for the prevention and control of disease.",

However, there are too many sources and sites through which any one can obtain information, and many of them are not credible which resulted in misinformation and difficulties to distinguish between rumors and reality. Thus, health care workers and the public must refer to trustworthy sources and information regarding COVID-19 such as WHO which provided social media teams and technical risk communication to respond and track rumors and myths.11 Additionally, government and health care facilities should provide transparent and clear communication with health care workers, staff, and public regarding COVID-19 outbreak.

The primary items were reviewed by seven experts in the field of clinical pharmacy and public health who were required to provide feedback and suggest necessary changes in order to establish both face and content validity of the survey questionnaire. Afterwards, the reliability of the questionnaire was established using a pilot test by collecting data from 20 pharmacists not included in the study sample. They were asked to fill in the questionnaire individually and were encouraged to think loudly and to speak what they meant by each answer and how they understood each question. Responses were voice recorded and questions were adjusted accordingly.",

Knowledge about COVID -19 was assessed using questions on basic knowledge and factual knowledge. Basic knowledge part consisted of 5 questions that included name, origin (place and vector), incubation period, and diagnosis. These were scored by assigning one point for each correct answer. Factual knowledge included questions on mode of transmission, signs and symptoms, and risk factors. The 3-point Likert scale was used to measure pharmacists perceived risk towards COVID19 by giving each item of the questionnaire one point (Disagree = 1, Neutral = 3, and Agree = 4) to analyze the results as follows: low score (1.00\u20131.66), medium score (1.67\u20132.33), and high score (2.34\u20133).

Additionally, living in city areas, having children, and working in a hospital pharmacy are all associated with a higher perceived risk of the coronavirus pandemic. Other studies also report a strong association between age and risk perception. For example, Jacob et al. found that younger age (16\u201324) predicted higher disease concern.20 In contrast, a study of 1290 US adults showed no association between age and engagement in protective measures during the H1N1 influenza pandemic.23 In our study, those below 25 and above 35 years had the highest risk perception, but the difference was not significant. This could be due to lower participation of younger age groups (<20 years) in both our study and the study from the US. Distinction between city and rural areas can also be justified by the variation in case numbers between different geographic areas.23 Therefore, we expect higher concern about viral spread in the more crowded cities. Jacobs also finds no association between having elderly and children in the household and disease concerns. This is however inconsistent with results from a similar study, where more household members predicted increased precautionary activities.23 It is justified as children can be more susceptible to viral infections. Nonetheless, it is worth to note the difference in disease vulnerability among children between H1N1 and the novel coronavirus. Whereas morbidity and mortality is increased in the former, COVID-19 appears to take a milder toll on children.4\n,\n24\n",

However, only 13.6% and 41.6% correctly identified headache and diarrhea, respectively, as disease symptoms. Those symptoms, in addition to nausea, may be the early clinical manifestation among coronavirus patients.4 Reports from earlier pandemics show similar satisfactory levels of disease knowledge among pharmacists. However, they remain inferior compared to other healthcare providers, possibly due to less involvement in hospital patient care. For example, when Albarrak et al. scored knowledge related to MERS, pharmacists (88.9%) ranked third to physicians (95.7%) and technicians (91.4%) in having \u2018Good\u2019 disease knowledge.17 Highest scores (94.4%) were attained for questions related to vaccine availability in the market and methods of viral transmission. Most (94.4%) pharmacists showed positive attitudes towards the MERS crisis, with all (100%) agreeing that protective masks, gloves, and googles should be used when dealing with patients, and that patients should be kept in isolation. This was in accordance with study results from Saudi and Vietnamese populations where attitudes towards wearing protective gear were also positive.33, 34, 35 The majority of pharmacists have also shown positive MERS practices, including washing hands with soap and water (72.2%), throwing used tissues in the trash (100%), and covering nose and mouth during sneezing and coughing (77.8%). However, only 27.8% reported wearing face masks in the crowds. Another small study of 35 healthcare providers (HCP) in hospitals and community pharmacies was conducted during the H1N1 pandemic.36 The study assessed the knowledge of HCP on the transmission, prevention, and management of H1N1. Pharmacists' knowledge was suboptimal among all three aspects. Additionally, most participants (64%) were uninformed about the drug management of H1N1 or the side effects (92.5%) of recommended antivirals.",
