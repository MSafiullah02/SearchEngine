The developed world responds to new and re-emerging diseases through the discovery of medications. Disease can be transmitted around the world in a day, but the development of medications does not occur at this rate. The world has one environment and the focus in health care must be on identifying factors in this environment that coalesce to produce disease. Aim. The aim of this paper is to introduce the integrative model of environmental health and explore its potential to illuminate the Toronto SARS experience.",

Response to this new disease varied from one area to another and was dependent upon the level of integration of health services and communication across services. The present focus of the health care system is on treating the results of disease rather than the causative factors. Reacting to a new disease had grave social and economic consequences. The time for a new global environmental approach to health is now. The Toronto SARS experience was examined using the integrative model of environmental health and the upstream perspective as exemplars to interrupt the traditional approach to disease. All health care providers share the responsibility to learn about and to understand how our environment creates disease. This knowledge comes through research on topics such as; chemicals, pesticides, soil erosion, killing of forests, contamination of water, destabilization of climate, and social disruption from wars. Conclusions. Health care systems in the developed world continue to focus on the treatment of disease. A global ecological initiative for an integrated disease prevention system must be negotiated among nations.",

Unique to this new disease was the worldwide effort and collaboration among countries to identify the causative agent. Why is this? To date, the exact mode of transmission is uncertain but it appears that human beings are vulnerable no matter their socio-economic status, race, gender, age and geographic location. We can only imagine the state of AIDS care or malaria care if these diseases had had the same status and level of collaboration that SARS has had. There is, however, some reason to be optimistic on this front. Mitka (2001) described a report issued by the Council on Foreign Relations and Milbank Memorial Fund arguing that United States of America (USA) foreign policy must consider the health of the people of the world for the following reasons. The USA is at increased risk from infectious diseases that know no borders, developing countries receive 42% of USA exports and poor health is known to create 'political instability, disenfranchises people with inadequate social capital, limits economic growth and exacerbates the human damage caused by social and economic dislocation ' (p. 1165) .",

The purpose of this paper is to examine a classical result of downstream approaches in health care in order to offer a way forward for nursing and others to reframe thinking about disease so that actions may begin upstream to prevent disease. Such actions could be referred to as 'strategic actions reframing systems' (SARS). The following strategies will be used in order to promote an upstream health care discourse: (a) The Dixon and Dixon (2002) integrative model of environmental health is presented as an organizing framework and contrasted with the public health model; (b) SARS and the Toronto experience in particular are examined using the Dixon and Dixon model, as well as other readings; (c) the results of the Toronto experience are interpreted in relation to the model and to upstream thinking and finally; (d) nursing research strategies that can reframe existing disease control discourses are presented.",

            "text": "Why this model? SARS is a new disease that affected people on three continents in a matter of days (CDC 2003, para 1). Globalization is a reality, but it will not be sustainable without environmental preservation (Friedman 1999) . In the recently released Institute of Medicine report on Emerging Infections: Microbial Threats to Health in the United States (Smolinski et al. 2003) , the impact of infectious diseases on the USA is described as steadily increasing. The report identifies 13 factors that contribute to new and re-emerging diseases. All of these factors have either a direct link to the environment or an indirect link through human actions. The environment has been a consistent domain in nursing theory, and nursing theorists' definitions of the environment are the subject of an important critique. Kleffel (1994) identified that nursing's present understanding of the environment is inadequate and set out to explicate an expanded nursing and environmental domain. Kleffel challenged nursing theorists to develop the knowledge base to create this expanded environmental domain. This yet to be developed knowledge could contribute to a better understanding by nurses of the context of care. The rather narrow view of the environment and the patient that nurses and other health care professionals have learned may perhaps be serving to drive health care professionals to consider only the immediate environment of the patient. Kleffel (1991) introduced Butterfield's ideas on upstream nursing approaches, urging nurses to work on modifying economic, political and environmental factors that coalesce and result in health problems. Traditional approaches locate the problem within the individual and keep strategies downstream. Dixon and Dixon (2002) proposed the integrated model of environmental health. The focus of the model was to move thinking from the agent and the individual to an examination of the environmental context in which humans live. Such a proposition creates the possibility for upstream thinking that connects us with what is happening in the environment. This connectedness creates awareness of the fact that infectious diseases kill twice as many people as cancer. These diseases kill 14AE4 million people each year (Worldwatch Institute 2003a ). Dixon and Dixon saw 'factors in the environment as major determinants of health for individuals and populations' (p. 43) and therefore the model supports upstream thinking. Dixon and Dixon (2002) The four domains deal with the following questions respectively: 'What is the problem' (p. 45)? 'Who is affected' (p. 47)? 'How does everyone know about this' (p. 49)? and 'What do people do about it' (p. 51)? These authors also believe that the existing public health epidemiological model falls short in getting thinking upstream.",

(1999) , it fails in its persistent focus on individual risk behaviours, and its dismissal of hazards that lie beyond personal choice, leading to failure to examine public health problems from the wider perspective of the global environment and the societies in which risk behaviours take place. Once risks are identified, public health departments have a good record on preventing and reducing risk through education. Public health departments control health problems using the results of epidemiological studies. For example, following discovery of the relationship between cigarette smoking and coronary heart disease and between injuries and automobile seatbelts, public health departments were instrumental in developing educational programmes on smoking cessation and the use of seatbelts (Mann et al. 1999 ). This work, although valuable, is still a response to what has already happened and brings us to where Dixon and Dixon (2002) want to go: what combination of factors has the potential to lead to a problem, and what can be done upstream so the world is not dealing with emerging diseases like SARS?",

Scientists were busy working on a vaccine. Politicians were busy doing damage control and defending public policy.

Meanwhile, the disease continued to simmer at home (Abraham & Priest 2003a) . Following the immediate reactions, criticism of provincial public health policy and hospital policy began to appear. Physicians criticized the lack of a provincial microbiology laboratory and a communication system (Abraham & Priest 2003b) . Nurses criticized the reduced employment of full-time nurses (Grinspun 2003) , and the fact that they were not being listened to when they knew the second wave of SARS was breaking out (Galloway 2003a) .

The model, however, does seem at times downstream. This observation comes from the sense that in the physiological domain there is an assumption that new disease is taken for granted. To be all the way upstream, the model needs to have an ecological domain that necessitates professionals and the public knowing the current status of the world's environment so that all communities are acting locally and putting systems in place to prevent or minimize exposure to emerging disease. There is always a risk in the unilateral application of any single theory to phenomena. In order to minimize this risk and do justice to this new disease, and to the model, the perspective of upstream thinking is now considered in relation to SARS. Butterfield (2002) noticed that 'the origins of disease are reinterpreted to emphasize individual behavioural factors (e.g. exercise, diet, stress) rather than the socially constructed conditions that promote those behaviours (e.g. lack of safe places to walk, easy access to high carbohydrate snacks, mundane and repetitive work tasks) ' (p. 37) . In order to interrupt the disease discourse that focuses on the individual and to open a discourse that makes visible the social constructedness of disease, Butterfield proposes for nurses an upstream perspective that elaborates nursing actions that are distributive and strategic. Distributive actions are those activities that nurses carry out on a day-to-day basis to incorporate environmental thinking into their work. They could include asking questions about the environment when interviewing clients, and working to alter the ways in which we carry out daily activities to include an environmental perspective. Distributive actions amount to vigilance toward ongoing threats in the environment. Nurses and physicians who specialize in infectious disease treatment have a unique opportunity to be upstream, and to scan the macro environment for precursors of disease and advocate societal strategies to reduce them.",

This new knowledge will enable for nurses and others to develop upstream discourses, although they are often caught downstream caring for the victims of diseases like SARS. Toronto, Canada and the world now have an opportunity to move their actions upstream, but first they need to see how they contribute to the social construction of phenomena in particular diseases. The social construction of phenomena referred to by Butterfield is a common thread in the work of several contemporary authors from different disciplines. For example, Kleinman et al. (1997) , Mann et al. (1999) and Friedman (1999) clearly saw the social connectedness from the perspectives of suffering, human rights and economics, respectively. The WHO operates within a public health model and therefore continues to focus on individual risk behaviours. It represents the public health voices of many countries and needs to examine public health problems from the wider perspective of the global environment in which risk behaviours happen. Upstream voices are needed in places like WHO that can alter discourses. Two such voices are those of nurses and nursing research that is strategic.",

Butterfield (2002) suggested that nurses should get involved in research to examine 'proposed etiologic links between environmental agents and the development of diseases such as Parkinson's and asthma ' (p. 44 ). In addition, nurses need to demonstrate how poverty, disease and violence are linked to environmental devastation. They need to know how the public views the environment in which they live, to find out what environmental concerns citizens have and to initiate needed research or implement existing research. Engagement of participants locally ensures that what is needed is addressed, and local success can be projected nationally and internationally (Kleinman et al. 1997 , Friedman 1999 . Through local connectedness nurses will know what illnesses are prevalent in their communities, and with comprehensive environmental knowledge can develop strong hunches about links between the two. They can be vital in reporting diseases with known and/or suspected environmental links. Tracking these diseases will lead to research confirming environmental links. Knowledge of these links is necessary in working to modify economic and political policy that induces and perpetuates environmental destruction resulting in poor health. Preservation of the environment has the potential to interrupt the development of further diseases. Nurses can play all of the roles from principal investigator in nationally funded studies, to instrument developer, to data collector, to organizing collaborative efforts for multi-site studies and identifying to researchers studies that need to be done.",
