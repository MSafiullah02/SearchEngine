Here, we provide preliminary data on the altruistic stem cell (ASC) based defense against a mouse corona virus; MHV-1 infection. In a mouse model of mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) mediated M. tuberculosis (Mtb) dormancy, MHV-1 infection in the lung exhibited 20 fold lower viral loads than the healthy control mice, suggesting the potential enhancement of an anti-MHV-1 defense by Mtb. This defense involved the in vivo expansion and reprogramming of CD271+ MSCs in the lung to ASC phenotype characterized by activation of genes involved in the HIF-2alpha stemness pathway. The conditioned media of the ASCs exhibited direct anti-viral activity in an in vitro model of MHV-1 induced toxicity to type II alveolar epithelial cells.

However, ASCs facilitated intracellular replication and extracellular release of Mtb. Thus, our data suggest that MSCs exert an innate defense against MHV-1 by activating the ASC defense mechanism, which might be exploited by dormant Mtb to undergo reactivation. Hence, our findings may provide a novel anti-viral defense mechanism against novel corona virus SARS-Cov2, which could be further utilized to develop vaccine against COVID19. Our findings also predict a potential increase of tuberculosis in post-COVID19 era.",

Thus, there is an urgent need to study the association of COVID19 with dormant TB reactivation to avoid a later global TB pandemic. Viral infection such as the influenza virus or SARS-Cov-1 is known to cause transient immune suppression that leads to reactivation of dormant bacterial infection (6) (7) 4) .

These stem cells reside in the bone marrow (BM) niche (19) and in the area of inflammation (20) . We have identified a rare fraction of cells in BM, the CD271+BM-mesenchymal stem cells (CD271+BM-MSCs) as the potential niche for dormant Mtb in both mice and humans (17) . In this stem cell niche, Mtb remains dormant, maintaining reactivation potential. Importantly, we have developed a mouse model of stem cell mediated Mtb dormancy (figure 3, (17) . Briefly, streptomycin dependent mutant 18b strain infected mice exhibit lung infection following 3 weeks of streptomycin treatment. These mice develop granulomas, and also acquire humoral immunity against the bacteria. Following streptomycin starvation for 6 months, the bacteria acquire a nonreplicating status. Mostly, these bacteria can be detected in the CD271+MSCs of BM, but a few are also present in the CD271+MSCs of lung (17) . Furthermore, Mtb harboring CD271+ MSCs reside in the hypoxic niche of BM (18) . Notably, in this model, the presence of Mtb-CFUs in the non-CD271+MSC compartment of lung can be utilized as a sign of Mtb reactivation. Thus, the model can be used to study the stem cell mediated Mtb reactivation. Using this mouse model of stem cell mediated Mtb dormancy; we sought to find out if corona virus can reactivate dormant Mtb (dMtb). We are using a mouse corona virus strain; murine hepatitis virus strain-1 (MHV-1), that represents clinically relevant model of human infecting corona virus strain; SARS-CoV-1 (21) (22) (23) . MHV-1 causes acute lung inflammation by inducing acute respiratory infection (ARI) within 2-4 days in C57BL/6 mice by increasing viral load. 5 Animals exhibit an elevated level of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-alpha during 2-14 days post-infection (21, 24) and then fully recover (21) . Importantly, in vitro study demonstrated that MHV-1 can infect type II alveolar epithelial (ATII) cells (25) . Therefore, ATII cells could be utilized in the MHV-1 model to study if these cells can exert the putative altruistic stem cell (ASC) based defense mechanism against the virus.",

Simultaneously, mice were also injected with streptomycin as the mutant 18b strain requires the antibiotic to replicate (30) . Study was ended after three weeks, because (i) three weeks of streptomycin is sufficient to establish lung infection (17) were sacrificed at stipulated time, lungs obtained, and the viral titers as well as Mtb-CFUs in the lung tissues were evaluated ( Figure 1B-C) . We also measured the TNF-alpha in the animals' blood on day-2 of MHV-1 infection to confirm MHV-1 induced immune response (21) . First, we evaluated the viral infection in the mice as shown in Figure 1B . MHV-1 infected healthy mice were used as the control. In this control group, streptomycin was also added to find out if addition of streptomycin can affect the viral load. MHV-1 infection in the control group led to an increase in viral titers in the mouse lung for the first 4 days, and then gradually decreased within next two weeks, which is consistent with the previous result of C57BL/6 mice (23). MHV-1 infected mice with dMtb (henceforth, dMtbMHV-1 group) showed an increase in viral load for the first 4 days similar to control, but then rapidly subsided at the end of two-weeks, where the viral load was 20-fold less than control group (p<0.004; Figure 1B) . The TNF-alpha levels in both the groups were increased by 3-4 fold (p<0.03; n=4) on day-2 (dMtb-32.5 \u00b111.4 vs7.3\u00b14.5pg/ml; dMtbMHV-1-36.5 \u00b114.7 vs9.5 \u00b1 3.6pg/ml).

Next, the Mtb-CFU of these two drugs treated mice with the Mtb-CFU obtained from one-month post-MHV-1 infected mice were compared. We found that Mtb-CFUs increased by only 3-4-fold (p=0.06; n=4) 13 following either dexamethasone or aminoguanidine treatment, which was 400-fold lower than the MHV-1 infection group (p<0.00001, n=4; Figure 1D ).

We hypothesized that during dMtb reactivation, the bacteria transfer from MSCs to non-MSC compartments in the lung (17) . Thus, we analyzed the lung CD271+MSCs for intracellular Mtb replication and release into the extracellular space. Lung CD271+MSCs were obtained by immunomagnetic sorting after a stipulated time period of MHV-1 infection, Viable cell count was obtained by trypan blue to evaluate expansion of these cells. The dMtb group served as a control. We also studied possible CD271+MSCs expansion in healthy mice infected with MHV-1 to evaluate a potential effect of this virus on MSCs of lung. Next, the sorted cells were cultured in serum-free media for 8 hours to evaluate both the intracellular and the extracellular release of Mtb by measuring Mtb-CFUs in the cell pellet and supernatant respectively. We found that the dMtbMHV-1 group showed a transient 12-fold (p<0.001) expansion of CD271+MSCs between day-0 and 8. Strikingly, we also found that MHV-1 infection alone group exhibited expansion of CD271+MSCs. However, the expansion was 6-fold lower than the dMtbMHV-1 group; the dMtb alone group showed no expansion of the MSCs ( Figure 2B) . Notably, in the dMtbMHV-1 group, along with MSC expansion, there was a corresponding 27-fold (p<0.0001) increase in the number of intracellular Mtb-CFUs ( Figure 2C ). 14 During this period supernatant of dMtbMHV-1 group did not exhibit marked increase in extracellular Mtb-CFUs compared to dMtb control ( Figure 2D ). However, in the next four days i.e. between day-8 and 12, supernatant showed a 40-fold increase of Mtb-CFU (p<0.0032; Figure   2D ). Thus, Mtb-transfer from CD271+ MSCs to non-CD271+MSC compartment probably occurred between the day-8 and 12, when the supernatant showed a sharp increase in Mtb-CFUs. ",

Briefly, when a clone of stem cells such as hESCs cell colony is threatened by hypoxia/oxidative stress induced differentiation/apoptosis, a few of these cells reprogram to an \"enhanced stemness\" phenotype. This phenotype is characterized by distinct gene expression associated with HIF-2alpha stemness pathway (26, 31) , and rapid expansion of the reprogrammed cells. These cells continue to maintain enhanced stemness phenotype for the next two weeks, and then activate p53 to undergo 15 differentiation/apoptosis. During the expansion period, these cells exhibit altruistic behaviors by secreting cytoprotective agents such as glutathione that enhance the fitness of the rest of the hES cells. Thus, we identified stem cells with the \"enhanced stemness\" reprogramming as altruistic Stem Cells (ASCs) (26) , and described these cells as \"intermediate\" cell type in Waddington's epigenetic landscape (32) ( Figure 3A ) (33) . Indeed, transient cells having ES cell like phenotype has been identified in mice and human, including our findings (34) using defined criteria (35) ( Figure 3B ), suggesting the clinical significance of ASCs. We speculate that this ASC reprogramming may function as a putative innate defense system against invading pathogens that threaten the integrity of the stem cells residing in their niches (35) . Thus, our findings of MHV-1 mediated transient expansion of CD271+MSCs may be part of the ASC defense mechanism against the virus. Indeed, the day-8 CD271+MSCs of MHV-1 infected healthy mice not only showed expansion ( Figure 2B ), but when subjected to real-time PCR gene expression study ( Figure 3C ), these cells also exhibited marked alteration of genes associated with enhanced stemness phenotype (HIF-1alpha, HIF-2alpha, Sox2, Oct4, Nanog, ABCG2, MDM2, GCL, p53, and p21) ( Figure 3D ). We further characterized the stemness of these CD271+MSCs and indeed, they expressed the MSC markers on day 8; CD73, CD74, and Sca-1 whereas CD45 was not expressed ( Figure 3D ). Demonstration of the increased up-regulation of p53-upstream genes bax, p21 and PUMA, and down-regulation of HIF-2alpha on day-20 ( Figure 3E) , further confirm the ASC reprogramming. We also noted that the expression of Sca-1 was down regulated in these cells on day 20 ( Figure 3E) , suggesting differentiation. Interestingly, in the dMtbMHV-1 group, the several ASC reprogramming related gene (Oct4, GCL and ABCG2) expression was increased by 2-3-fold compared to MHV-1 infection alone group ( Figure 3D) . Thus, these findings suggest that MHV-1 infection led to ASC reprogramming of CD271+MSCs, and this reprogramming was also seen in the dMtb harboring mice, when infected with MHV-1.",

Notably, a significant number of infected individuals have recovered. However, evidence for a possible host defense or anti-viral mechanism against the virus has not yet been identified. Currently, there are no approved drugs or vaccines to treat COVID-19. Here, we demonstrate a mouse corona virus model with a potential ASC based defense mechanism activated by dMtb loaded lung CD271+MSCs against the virus. As per recent data from some surveys and reports, it has been seen that countries which do not have a policy of universal Bacille Calmette Guerin (BCG) vaccination have experienced higher mortality related to COVID-19 (36) (37) . Interestingly, BCG is closely related to Mtb which enhanced ASC based defense mechanism of CD271+MSCs to fight against MHV-1 infection. Thus, our results described here could provide a novel explanation of BCG mediated host defense or anti-viral mechanism against SARS-CoV2 that could be further utilized to design a drug or vaccine against the virus.",

We have identified a similar altruistic stem cell defense system in hESc, wherein a subset of these cells, (SSEA3+/ABCG2+), acquire an enhanced stemness state that enable these cells to secrete antioxidants and growth factors in the hostile microenvironment of oxidative stress. This altruistic act protects the rest of the population from oxidative stress induced apoptosis and differentiation (26) . The enhanced stemness state is associated with an increased expression of Oct-4 and Nanog governed by an altered and transient state of the p53/MDM2 oscillation system. After two weeks, the SSEA3+/ABCG2+ ES cell population undergoes apoptosis or differentiation, thus exhibiting an altruistic behavior i.e. enhancing group fitness by sacrificing self-fitness (26) . In this preliminary study, we have demonstrated an ASC based innate defense response against infection with the mouse corona virus; MHV-1. The recovered lung CD271+MSCs of MHV-1 infected mice exhibited the ASC phenotype, as shown by their expansion, and expression of genes associated with the HIF-2alpha stemness pathway, followed by the activation of p53 and its downstream genes including p21 and p53 up-regulated modulator of apoptosis (PUMA) on day-20. The activation of genes involved in p53 mediated apoptosis/differentiation was associated with the decrease in lung CD271+MSCs, suggesting that the cells might undergo apoptosis or differentiation, an important phenotypic characteristic of 18 ASCs and ASC based defense mechanism. Notably, further support was obtained for ASC reprogramming in vitro by studying the cytoprotective activity of these ASCs in MHV-1 mediated toxicity of lung alveolar epithelial cells. Thus, the conditioned media of the CD271+MSCs recovered from the MHV-1 infected mouse lung exhibited a direct anti-viral and cytoprotective property on MHV-1 infected type II alveolar epithelial (ATII) cells. Hence, we have identified a unique anti-viral defense system mediated by the innate ASCs. We suggest that ASC defense system may be harnessed to develop novel therapeutic strategies against COVID19.",

            "text": "Following MHV-1 infection, the non-replicating dormant m18b-harboring CD271+MSCs underwent ASC reprogramming, and permitted m18b replication. There was also a potential transfer of the pathogen to the extracellular space. However, the detailed mechanism of Mtb reactivation needs further investigation. Here, we speculate that MHV-1 infection inducing inflammation might trigger the mobilization of dMtb harboring MSCs from BM to lung and cause rapid Mtb reactivation in lung, because; (i) studies showed that stem cells mobilize to the area of infection (20) (ii) after 6 months of streptomycin starvation, a few Mtb was found in mice lung CD271+MSCs, whereas a greater number of Mtb were inside BM-CD271+MSCs (17) . The remarkable and significant finding at this moment of COVID19 pandemic is that the Mtb reactivation was associated with significant boosting of the ASC mediated anti-viral activity. 19 Lancet has recently reported that most of the death related to COVID19 is due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which is characterized by cytokine storm. This will mediate a severe attack by the immune system, as seen in cases of SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV infection, leading to the death of the individual (39) . Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are immunosuppressive and they release various immune modulators like nitric oxide (NO), prostaglandin (PGE2), interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-10, which can modulate the innate and adaptive immune response (35) . We speculate that MSC to ASC reprogramming may further increase the secretion of these immunosuppressive cytokines, thus potentially contributing to the reduction of the cytokine storm in COVID19 subjects treated with MSC therapy. BCG vaccine has been proposed to work against COVID19 infection, although the mechanism is not yet known. It is possible that BCG may remain dormant in the lungs, which then reprogram the MSCs to ASCs following COVID19 infection and thus, could exhibit antiviral defense against the virus. MSCs were already shown to exhibit antiviral activity via extracellular vesicles carrying microRNA (40) (41) (42) and human cathelicidin hCAP-18/ LL-3 (43) against influenza, hepatitis C and pneumonia respectively. We also have previously used BCG-MSC interaction to target cancer stem cell (CSCs) (44) . We speculate that the immunosuppressive property of MSCs could help in neutralizing the severe cytokine storm caused by COVID-19. In SARS-CoV2 MHV-1 infection model and immune response, the role of trained immunity has not been evaluated. The trained immunity constitutes innate immune memory where hematopoietic cells may undergo cell intrinsic changes including metabolic and epigenetic modifications to remember pathogenic insult (45) (46) (47) (48) (49) (50) . Trained immunity of MSCs has not yet been studied.",
