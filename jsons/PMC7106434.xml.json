In 1984, a religious sect in the USA deliberately contaminated restaurant salad bars with Salmonella typhimurium, intending to disrupt local elections.2 The attack resulted in several hundred cases of salmonellosis and no deaths. The anthrax letters incident in 2001 in the USA resulted in 11 cases of inhalation anthrax, with five deaths, and another 11 cases of cutaneous disease.3 Extensive circumstantial evidence strongly suggests that the perpetrator was a civilian employee of the US military. However, no evidence of a clear motive was found. Thousands of workers received prophylactic or post-exposure therapy, and affected buildings were decontaminated at huge expense.4, 5 In 1993, a cult in Japan carried out an attack using anthrax spores with no physical casualties,6 but later, evidence of post-traumatic stress syndromes was found in victims of the attack.7 The perpetrators were apparently planning to use other agents such as Q fever bacteria, botulinum toxin, and Ebola viruses,8 but they were detained before they could implement further attacks.",

Additionally, in the past few years, developments in the field of microbial genetics have heightened concern about the possible abuse of new technologies. Since there are so many unknowns, it is extremely difficult to assess the risks and threats of bioterrorism.9, 10 The most likely perpetrators could be disgruntled individuals, terrorist organisations, or rogue countries that are believed to support international terrorism. Whereas individual attackers are unlikely to cause mass casualties, terrorist organisations could pose a substantial threat if they gain access to sophisticated biological weapons, materials, or scientific expertise. Although regulations and safeguards for securing dangerous pathogens in research laboratories now exist in most countries, the scope of these regulations and the extent of the safeguards vary.11 Rogue countries have the necessary capabilities for a bioterrorist attack but might be restrained by the threat of the response of a unified global community.",

A bioterrorist attack has a lot in common with naturally occurring public health emergencies resulting from infectious diseases. However, there are some important differences. Since it is a deliberate act to cause harm, there are the obvious security considerations. The resulting outbreak differs in some important ways from naturally occurring epidemics\u2014for instance, it is more likely to be a point source outbreak initiated by simultaneous exposure to many people. The infectious agent used is likely to be uncommon and possibly not endemic to the region, might have been modified genetically to make it resistant to current medications and vaccines, and produced in a way that enhances its transmission or virulence. Therefore, early clinical symptoms and signs after infection with a bioterrorist agent might be unusual, complicating both recognition and management of the disease. These factors could create greater public panic.",

            "text": "Despite the many similarities with naturally occurring outbreaks of infectious disease, preparedness for bioterrorist attacks is more complex. In many aspects, a bioterrorist attack has the characteristics of a mass casualty event, and thus preparedness involves strengthening of the specialised infrastructure that is required for treatment of seriously ill patients over a very short period of time. New prophylactic and treatment regimens for unusual diseases are required, to ensure their accessibility when needed, along with clear standards for the handling and study of dangerous pathogens. When the proportion of available resources that should be devoted to bioterrorism is decided, the potential effect on funding for other important health and security threats must be considered. Preparedness for bioterrorism will inevitably improve the ability to detect and control other infectious diseases, in particular emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases. Thus, resources diverted to preparedness for potential bioterrorism have a dual purpose. For instance, funding for new vaccine technologies for potential bioterrorist agents are very likely to lead to advances in the development and improvement of vaccines for common, important infectious agents, such as Zika virus, dengue virus, or the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus.",

Genetic modifications could be made using the tools of synthetic biology; such activities might be an example of dual-use research.19, 20 For instance, in 2005, the 1918 Spanish influenza pandemic virus was reconstructed,21 and the poliovirus was synthesised nearly 20 years ago.22 The addition of an immunomodulatory gene to the mousepox virus genome in 2001,23 rendered a mousepox vaccine ineffective, and this technology could potentially be applied to the smallpox virus.24 The recent synthesis of the extinct horsepox virus24 has been a reminder that the smallpox virus could be reconstructed, and that the regulations that have been put in place to prevent the misuse of powerful, cheap, and globally available tools must be reconsidered.25 This possibility has also raised the issue of whether research results should sometimes be censored, or even refused publication, if the potential to cause harm is too high.19\n",

For instance, the R0 of pneumonic plague has been estimated to be around 1\u00b73,26 whereas the R0 for smallpox is likely to be around 5.27 For diseases that are not contagious, such as inhalational anthrax, the number of cases of disease will depend almost entirely on the size of the population exposed and the timing of post-exposure antibiotic prophylaxis.28 Aerosolised agents remain the threat of most concern, but safety and security of food29, 30, 31 and water supplies32 are also important components of primary prevention (panel 3\n).

To obtain information rapidly, the ongoing collection of health-related data (termed syndromic surveillance) has been introduced, to monitor patterns of symptoms and signs that are suggestive of an outbreak.49, 50, 51, 52 Although it was hoped that syndromic surveillance would be a more sensitive method for early detection of an epidemic, frequent reports of unusual increases in incidence of non-specific illnesses can desensitise and paralyse the system.53 In fact, early detection will depend largely on alert, prepared clinicians. For example, when the 2001 anthrax attacks occurred, an astute clinician identified the index case.34 Emergency room and community physicians should be updated regularly on the clinical signs and symptoms associated with the most common bioterrorist agents.54 The syndromic surveillance system would be more useful after suspicious or confirmed cases have been reported by physicians. A focused analysis of the surveillance data against non-specific, background disease rates could detect changes and provide information about the dynamics of the disease. Special legislation might then be necessary, to gain access to medical records.55\n",

            "text": "The management of patients that have been infected during incidents of bioterrorism can be challenging.64 Precautions and treatment regimens for several bioterrorist agents are summarised in panel 4\n. Although supportive care serves as the basis of management for all agents, treatments for some of the relevant diseases have substantially progressed. The management of inhalation anthrax has advanced since the 2001 attack,64, 70, 71 with improvements in critical care, and in treatment of acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome, severe sepsis, and septic shock. Pleural effusions are routinely drained and there are more options for antimicrobial therapy. Antibiotics are still recommended for 60 days after exposure or diagnosis, together with the anthrax vaccine. If the vaccine is given concurrently with antibiotic treatment, the period of treatment could be shortened. Antibiotics for treatment of other bacterial infection are usually given for shorter periods, since the causative agents do not sequester spores. Tularaemia is treated with ciprofloxacin or doxycycline.72 For smallpox, antivirals such as cidofovir or a related acyclic nucleoside phosphonate analogue appear to be more effective than post-exposure vaccines in preventing mortality, according to experiments in non-human primates infected with monkeypox virus.73 This suggests that antivirals might play an important role when preparing for a smallpox outbreak. For viral haemorrhagic fevers, ribavirin might have some efficacy in post-exposure prophylaxis. A small-molecule antiviral drug, GS-5734, has been developed that appears to be effective in treating Ebola virus infection.74\nPanel 4Precautions and treatment regimens for patients affected by selected agents\nSmallpox\nStandard contact and airborne precautions should be taken.65 Supportive therapy and antibiotics can be provided for secondary infections. There is some evidence of the potential efficacy of thiosemicarbazones. Cidofovir has shown in vitro efficacy against variola, and has shown efficacy against other diseases caused by human orthopoxviruses, notably diseases caused by vaccinia viruses. It has also shown efficacy in animal models of orthopoxvirus infections. Since 2012, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved drugs and biologic agents developed under the Animal Rule. This rule allows for approval of a drug that cannot be tested for efficacy in humans, but is effective in animals and safe in humans. The first drug approved under this rule was the monoclonal antibody raxibacumab for treatment of inhalation anthrax. Tecovirimat is a drug that inhibits all orthopoxviruses tested in vitro. It was found to be highly effective in treating monkeypox and rabbitpox in animals and is considered safe in humans.66 Tecovirimat is being considered by the FDA for approval for use in humans to treat smallpox under the Animal Rule.\nPneumonic plague\nStandard and droplet precautions should be taken.65 Ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, and doxycycline have been approved for the treatment of pneumonic plague. Streptomycin and gentamicin have been found to be effective in treatment, although there is some evidence of the development of multiple resistance.67, 68\n\nTularaemia\nIsolation of the patients is not necessary and standard precautions should be taken. Ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, and doxycycline are all approved for the treatment of tularaemia. Streptomycin and gentamicin have been found to be effective.68, 69\n\nHaemorrhagic fevers\nStandard contact and airborne precautions should be taken until diagnosis is confirmed. Subsequently, droplet precautions can be considered. Supportive care and treatment of secondary infections can be provided. Ribavirin is now approved for treatment of Lassa fever and it also appears to be effective against new world arenaviruses and Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever.\nInhalation anthrax\nProtective N95 respirators and clothing should be provided to health-care personnel. Clothing of patients should undergo decontamination and thorough handwashing. Supportive therapy is available, with antibiotics such as ciprofloxacin, doxycycline and ampicillin. If the bacteria are resistant to some of the antibiotics, the treatment regimen will depend on sensitivity testing.\nBotulism\nNo isolation is needed and standard precautions should be maintained. Patients require supportive care and passive immunisation with equine antitoxin. The licensed antitoxin (Emergent BioSolutions, Winnipeg MB, Canada) neutralises botulinum toxin serotypes A, B, and C. A licensed heptavalent (A, B, C, D, E, F, G) equine antitoxin produced by Cangene (Emergent BioSolutions, Winnipeg MB, Canada) is available from the CDC.",

In regions with poor infrastructure, it might be necessary to consider treating patients in their homes.

During the Ebola virus outbreak in west Africa, suspect cases were held until they could be cleared as negative, which took about 3 days pending the PCR results. On a national level, reducing the movement of populations is a sensitive issue, potentially interfering with commerce.79 Closure of schools is an important means of achieving social distancing to reduce spread. Whether the public should use masks during an outbreak of a contagious disease is less clear,80 and the efficacy of the masks is extremely variable.

To the majority of the population, only post-exposure prophylaxis is relevant. Post-exposure prophylaxis for an intentional outbreak would include both those people known to be exposed during the incident and those people who were infected by others. The prophylaxis itself might consist of both vaccines and antimicrobials. When using live, attenuated vaccines, the relatively large proportion of the population who has some form of immunodeficiency has to be taken into account.81, 82 Monoclonal antibody preparations are now being considered for prophylaxis in select, high risk groups.83\nTable 2\nsummarises pharmacological prophylaxis for Tier 1 pathogens.",

            "text": "Currently, the vaccines that would most likely be used for pre-exposure or post-exposure prophylaxis are the smallpox and anthrax vaccines. Since routine vaccination against smallpox was stopped in the 1980s, less than 50% of the world's population has been vaccinated, and antibody titres usually decline markedly after 5 to 10 years.84 Residual cell-based immunity can persist for many years.85, 86 Post-exposure prophylaxis involves ring vaccination, which requires intensive tracing and vaccination of primary contacts, followed by vaccination of secondary contacts,86 and finally, vaccination of all people in a defined affected region. For post-exposure prophylaxis of those directly exposed during the incident, vaccination can be effective if given within 3 to 4 days of exposure.87 Since it might take that amount of time to detect the first cases after exposure, the vaccine will generally only be effective for secondary and subsequent contacts. Immune-boosting adjuvants88 and toll-like receptor agonists have the potential to improve the immune response to post-exposure vaccination.89 Serious side-effects are relatively rare90, 91 but can affect compliance.92 In those cases, lower doses of vaccine might be administered, to provide adequate protection with fewer side-effects.93 Newer smallpox vaccines are in development,94 including those that could immunise people who have atopic dermatitis.95 Because it is produced in small quantities by collecting antiserum from immunised humans, there might be a shortage of vaccinia immune globulin, used to treat people who would have serious side-effects with the vaccine. One possible solution to this shortage would be to use antibodies against other poxviruses, such as cowpox and monkeypox,96 because of their cross-protective properties.",

The protective, antigen specific memory B cells persist for many years after vaccination and are associated with humoral immunity.99 Serum IgG response to the vaccine has been 100% after the fourth dose.101 For post-exposure prophylaxis in unvaccinated people, the vaccine should be administered as a three-dose subcutaneous series (at 0, 2, and 4 weeks), in conjunction with a 60-day course of appropriate antimicrobial drugs. It has been given to thousands of US military personnel, and notable adverse events have been rare.102 The anthrax vaccine is not recommended for pregnant women, although one study103 with women in the US military, inadvertently vaccinated during pregnancy, did not show evidence of an increase in birth defects. In this study, 4418 women received the vaccine in the first trimester and 423 in the second and third trimeseter.

Imported cases of Ebola virus disease were identified in the USA and Spain. Locally, in the affected countries in west Africa, 10% of the people who died because of Ebola virus disease were health-care workers. Various shortcomings in the response to the epidemic have been identified since (panel 1).",

Lessons from the 2014 west African Ebola virus epidemic show that health-care providers must always be watchful for unusual presentations of disease, and new and improved approaches must be developed for early detection and response. Health-care providers need more effective means of isolating infected patients, and better methods to control the movement of potentially infected people outside of the affected areas. Personal protective equipment should be inexpensive and effective, and available to use with minimal training and under harsh environments. Protection of health-care workers against infection remains particularly problematic, and should be a focus of research and development. The Ebola virus epidemic has highlighted the importance of improving the logistics of moving human and material resources in areas with relatively poor infrastructure. Risk communication and public education before and during an outbreak need to be improved. More clinical trials should be fast-tracked during development of new vaccines and antiviral drugs. Preparedness for a low-risk, high-impact event that is bioterrorism should be monitored constantly, tested in tabletop exercises,142, 143 and integrated into the routine functioning of the health system. Here it would serve the dual purpose of ensuring that countries are prepared to meet the challenges of controlling epidemics of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases.",
