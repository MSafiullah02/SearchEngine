For the binding assay, S1 protein conditioned mediums were mixed with the cells and incubated at 4 \u00b0C for 1 h. After washing, the cells were incubated for 30 min at 4 \u00b0C with anti-6\u00d7 His mAb (R&D systems, Minneapolis) or sera from SARS patients. Normal mouse or human sera were used as control. The cells were then washed and incubated for 30 min with diluted fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled antiserum. Cells were analyzed with a Moflo cytometer (Dako Cytomation, Denmark).

These fragments would be secreted into the culture medium because of the signal peptide ligated to their N terminal, and their existence in conditioned medium was tested by ELISA. The binding of these proteins to Vero E6 cells was analyzed by FACS using sera from SARS patients or anti-6\u00d7 His mAb. We found that both S640 and S500 were able to bind with Vero E6 cells while S440 was unable to do so (Fig. 1A\n). Further study with S500 showed that it did not bind to non-infectable cells such as HeLa cells (Fig. 1B). Moreover, this S500 binding could be blocked if S500 was pre-incubated with neutralizing sera from convalescent SARS patients (Fig. 1C). These studies indicate that S500 could specifically interact with a putative receptor expressed on the surface of Vero E6 cells. Similar results were recently reported that the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the S protein located in the N-terminal 318\u2013510 residuals [15], [16]. Our results further indicated that 503\u2013510 residuals were unnecessary for binding with the receptor.",

We found that the F5 cells were highly susceptible to HIV/SARS pseudovirus while non-transduced control HeLa cells were non-infectable (Fig. 2B). The presence of a functional receptor for S protein in the F5 cells was further confirmed by the cell\u2013cell fusion assay. For this purpose, we established S-expressing HeLa cells (S-HeLa) by transducing the S gene into HeLa cells. When the F5 cells were co-cultured with S-HeLa cells, many syncytiums could be observed (Fig. 2C). These results demonstrated that F5 cells expressed a functional receptor required for HIV/SARS pseudovirus or SARS-CoV infection, which not only had a high binding affinity with the S protein but also was sufficient to mediate the entry of the virus.",

            "text": "Two strategies were used to recover the cDNA sequence encoding the receptor protein for HIV/SARS pseudovirus in the F5 cells. Recombinant retroviruses could ectopically express the encoded cDNA library proteins to confer the infectivity of the HIV/SARS pseudovirus. Alternatively, the retroviral vector used for cloning cDNA libraries had two long terminal repeat sequences (LTRs) on both sides of the cDNA insert. The LTRs could function as a promoter to initiate the transcription of their downstream sequences [17]. Integration of recombinant retroviruses containing two LTR promoter sequences into the upstream region of an endogenous gene might thus transcriptionally activate the expression of the downstream endogenous gene by the second LTR promoter element in the virus. We analyzed both possibilities by extracting the genomic DNAs from F5 cells. The virus-encoded cDNA was amplified by PCR using the primers flanking inserts in the retroviral vectors. A 1.3 k PCR product was cloned. DNA sequencing revealed the cDNA encoded triosephosphate isomerase (TPI). Analysis of the expression of TPI in non-permissive and permissive cells to infection suggested that there was no correlation between the susceptibility of the HIV/SARS pseudovirus and TPI expression in various cells (data not shown). Therefore, we tested the possibility that the LTR\u2013TPI\u2013LTR fragment might accidentally integrate into the upstream region of the endogenous receptor gene for S protein so that the second LTR activated the transcription of the endogenous receptor gene in the F5 cells. The expression of this receptor protein conferred the infectivity of F5 cells to HIV/SARS pseudovirus. To identify the genome DNA sequences downstream of the retroviral LTR element, we used the thermal asymmetric interlaced (TAIL) PCR, a method for recovery of DNA fragment adjacent to known sequences [14], [18]. After three rounds of TAIL-PCR, a 300 basepair (bp) band and a 900 bp band were detected (Fig. 3A\n). The PCR products were cloned and sequenced. Sequence alignment indicated that one of them was part of the retrovirus vector sequence and the other was the 5\u2032 region of the human ACE2 gene. The retrovirus integrated into the 5\u2032 end of the endogenous ACE2 gene so that there was only 169 bp from the end of retroviral LTR to the start codon (ATG) of endogenous ACE2. The integration of the retroviral LTR into the upstream region of the endogenous ACE2 gene was further confirmed by genomic DNA PCR using primers specific to LTR and ACE2 (Figs. 3B and D).",

To further confirm the receptor function of ACE2, we pre-incubated the F5 cells with anti-ACE2 polyclonal antibody before challenging the cells with the pseudovirus and found that the infection could be abrogated (Fig. 4A\n). We then cloned the ACE2 cDNA from F5 cells by RT-PCR and transfected it into NIH3T3 cells. The ACE2-expressing NIH3T3 cells exhibited similar infectivity to that of F5 cells to HIV/SARS pseudovirus (Fig. 4B). These results clearly demonstrated that ACE2 was the functional receptor for SARS-CoV. When we were preparing this manuscript, Li et al.
