We would like to remind them that up\u2010regulation of intrahepatic interferon\u2010stimulated genes (ISG) is associated with treatment failure in patients with chronic HCV, and levels of ISG are differently distributed according to different IL28B genotypes.4 Furthermore, Prokunina\u2010Olsson and her collaborators demonstrated that IFNL4 induces ISG expression in HepG2 hepatoma cells.5 Thus, high baseline ISG levels might be associated with poor response to exogenous IFN, by exhausting the IFN response pathways.6\n",
