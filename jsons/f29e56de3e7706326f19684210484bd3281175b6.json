This is in line with findings from two previous studies in England/Wales and Germany in which M. pneumoniae was detected by PCR in 0.5-4% of patients with RTI (10, 11) . These studies were performed before the occurrence of the most recent M. pneumoniae epidemics in Europe in 2010-2012 and other recent studies describing much higher rates of M. pneumoniae detection in children with RTI (6, (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) . For example, a study in the Netherlands including children aged 3 months to 16 years from July 2008 to November 2011 showed that 16% of children with RTI (mean age 2.7 years) and 21% of asymptomatic children (mean age 5.6 years) were positive for M. pneumoniae by PCR (6) . Importantly, the prevalence of M. pneumoniae in children with RTI was lower in the years 2008/2009 compared to 2010/2011, with 4-7% and 21-24%, respectively, suggesting a considerable year-toyear variation likely influenced by the presence of local or national M. pneumoniae epidemics. The lower prevalence of M. pneumoniae in our study might be explained by an absence of an M. pneumoniae epidemic between 2010 and 2014 in our region. Such a diverse regional prevalence of M. pneumoniae seems possible as other European regions or countries in the same time interval also did not report an increasing M. pneumoniae prevalence (18) .

However, the proportion of other pathogens identified was low in the group of M. pneumoniae-positive children. This strongly suggests that the detection of M. pneumoniae in the nasopharyngeal specimen as a single organism increases the likelihood of causality for the RTI. This notion is supported by another study reporting that over 40% of symptomatic children with M. pneumoniae detected had no other pathogen identified in their nasopharyngeal specimen (6) . There are limited data comparing sensitivity of upper versus lower respiratory tract samples for M. pneumoniae. However, the available evidence indicates that in most cases, both specimens are positive. Thus, the detection of M. pneumoniae in the nasopharyngeal specimen of a symptomatic child with lower RTI strongly implicates this pathogen as the cause of the pneumonia (23, 24) . This interpretation is also in line with evidence showing the narrowing of the microbiota present in nasopharyngeal specimen from children with RTI (25) .
