            "text": "This paper is motivated by the global spread of the coronavirus referred to as COVID-19 and its effect on Sub-Saharan African (SSA) economies. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has alluded to the COVID-19 not only affecting the global health but also trade and tourism, commodity prices, and financial conditions that calls for an additional policy response to support demand and ensure an adequate supply of credit (IMF 2020a, b). Sub-Sahara African countries have equally been affected though infection cases are low compared to the epic centre Europe. To this effect, World Bank Group (WBG) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) have availed financial support packages to help low income and emerging market countries in the prevention, detection and treatment of COVID-19. IMF availed about US$50 billion through the Rapid-Disbursing Emergency Financing Facilities for low income and emerging market countries that needed financial support. As of 17th  March, the World bank and International Finance Corporation (IFC) increased the financial aid to prevent, detect and treat COVID-19 to a tune of US$14 billion of which US$6 billion was marked for health measures and US$8 billion to support private companies and their employees affected by the economic downturn caused by COVID-19 (World Bank 2020a, b). IFC\u2019s working capital facility will help banks continue lending to Small Medium Enterprises (SMEs) suffering from the economic fallout of the pandemic. However, access to IFC funds is based on credit, environmental and social governance and compliance criteria, as alluded by IFC. Hence, it is not a given that all countries will access these funds.",

These measures have been effective in other parts of the world such as Australia according to Milne and Xie (2020) and collaborate with the declining transmission rate trajectory in SSA over time as shown in Fig. 1. With the first SSA case recorded in Nigeria on the 28th of February and subsequent new cases in other countries, the initial local transmission in the region is noted in South Africa on 7th of March at 100% rate. As at end of April, the transmission rate stood at a low of 6% despite having 19,490 confirmed cases in SSA. The decline in the transmission rate that commenced end of March coincides with the SSA government implementation of social distancing measures. This indicates an increase in the number of local transmitted confirmed cases at a slow pace at inception of social distancing measures implementation, end of March. With strict adherence to social distancing alongside other measures, the region may sustain low transmission rate and preventive spread in the congested townships.",

The implies that urban townships are more susceptible to the exposure of the virus than rural areas given the high person per kilometre square occupancy as well as access to populated social amenities. According to the 2020 World meter data, Eastern Africa and Western Africa have the highest person per kilometre square occupancy in SSA, recorded at 67 persons per km2 and 66 persons per km2, respectively, as shown in Fig. 2b. Low person per kilometre square occupancy is recorded at 28 persons per km2 and 25 persons per km2 for Middle Africa and Southern Africa, respectively. Therefore, slackened adherence to social distancing may propel the virus spread to congested townships and the effect is likely to be more severe in SSA than confirmed cases in North America1 on account of persons per km squared measure. Eastern Africa and Western Africa with 2.35 and 2.30 times more persons per km squared occupancy than North America density occupancy are likely to be the most affected part of SSA as shown in Fig. 2c. With the upward curve exhibited in Fig. 1, relaxing social distancing may enhance infection transmission and spread to congested townships.",

To boost economic activities, most SSA governments have pronounced relief measures focusing on tax exemptions and business compensation. The heightened monetary demand has been cushioned by WBG and IMF relief packages. Despite the interventional measures instituted by WBG and IMF to cushion the economic downturn effect on SSA economies, countries face a high economic risk given the prevailing underlying health infrastructures and resource deficiency, unsustainable high debt levels and existing drought effects due to climate change. World Health Organization (WHO) recommended doctor-to-population ratio is 1:1000 (Kumar and Pal 2018). As of end 2015, WHO reported inadequate doctors in SSA that stood at less than 1 per 1000 population at a record of 0.2 per 1000 population. Restricting ranking of the inadequate doctor-to-population ratio levels from 2015 to 2017, South Africa with the highest ratio close to the WHO standard depicted 0.9 per 1000, with the least of 0.0 per 1000 recorded for Somalia, Sierra Leone, Liberia, Togo, Malawi, Chad and Tanzania. Most of the remaining countries fell in the 0.1 per 1000 population category such as Zambia, Zimbabwe, Uganda, Lesotho, Mozambique, Burundi, Burkina Faso, Cameron, Congo DR, Central republic, Eritrea, Swaziland, Ethiopia, Gambia, Guinea, Mali, Niger, Rwanda and Senegal as shown in Fig. 3 (World Bank 2020a, b). To meet the doctor demand, outsourcing is very unlikely given the global doctor challenge in all parts of COVID-19-affected countries but utilise available medical personnel.",

The fiscal capacity adjustment is inevitable to address surgeon deficiency as well as develop emergency response infrastructure and procure required ventilators for extreme cases.

For exceptional few companies still engaged in production, operations come at a cost as the restricted supply chains disrupt access to inputs. Hence, some regional stores have incurred losses and foreclosures, and subsequent job losses. An example is the closure of some stores for a renowned Southern Africa regional group clothes chain stores trading as Edcon Ltd, with stores such as Egdars, Jets and CNA.

On a global front, the economic downturn is buttressed by loss of export revenues in commodity export-based countries due to a trade fall with developed and emerging countries, particularly China. As at early April, trade fall led to currency depreciation for most of SSA currencies. The year to date currency depreciation according to African Markets for the most affected currencies was 49% for the Zimbabwean currency, 33% for the Zambian Kwacha, 32% for the South African Rand, 28% for Namibian dollar and 15%% for the Botswana Pula. Subsequently, these will push up local inflation and trigger monetary policy and financial tightening. Furthermore, loan repayments on the rising dollar debt will surge to higher levels.",

Resilience is the capacity of complex systems of people and nature to withstand disturbance without shifting into an alternate regime, or a different type of system organised around different processes and structures (Holling 1973). It is also described as a process to ensure soft landing after a shock and prevent a lasting damage to a functionality (Linkov et al. 2016). From a 4-resilience stage, SSA is in the vulnerability stage on account of the increasing virus spread cases as shown in Fig. 1. Vulnerability concept, defined as the magnitude of system damage given the occurrence of a disruptive scenario (Jonsson et al. 2008), is applied to the COVID-19 pandemic. SSA region falls under the vulnerability phase as it is still vulnerable to the virus spread given the upward confirmed cases in Fig. 1 with a record of 19,490 cases as at end of April.",

Appallingly, the infancy stage of the COVID-19 spread in SSA avails little data to apply quantitative methods in assessing resilience. However, recent historical index is utilised to project resilience during the pandemic. The most recent 2019 FM Global Resilience Index that evaluates business resilience to disruption indicates good SSA resilience derived from inherent cyber risk, oil intensity and urbanisation rate with an average resilience index of 71, 82 and 65%, respectively, as shown in Fig. 6.

At a micro-level, restricted supply chains have disrupted access to inputs which has increased the cost of production, scarcity of essentials and a surge in prices. Business closures have resulted in job losses, low liquidity levels and compromised household consumption.
