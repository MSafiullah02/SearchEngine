There are a certain number of other governing bodies that are directly involved in the management of hospitals. A cross-ministry group was set up in 2006 to facilitate the implementation of hospital reforms. Apart from the organizational structure, the funding of hospitals and its evolution is studied. Between 1979 and 1991, the government introduced a co-payment system in healthcare establishments. In 1992, the Ministry of Health officially granted greater autonomy to public hospitals. They were authorized to deliver paid services and to make profits, but were made responsible for their losses and debts. By 2003, central government funding had fallen to 8% of the hospital budget. As a result, public hospitals in China behave very similarly to for-profit firms, while being governed as any traditional public structure. The next step is the current experiment of a Diagnostics Related Group-based payment in China. Along with the financial autonomy of public hospitals, different reforms have been directed at developing private hospitals, even though many obstacles still remain.",

Because of the historical healthcare system context, the public sector is more mature than the private one. As a consequence, some pilot reforms are introduced only in the public sector. As example is the implementation of a Diagnostics Related Group-(DRG)-based payment presented at the end of the first section of this Chapter. Actually, this does not mean that the private sector will be immune to these new forms of funding. In the United States, for instance, when the DRG-based payment was introduced, it was designed for Medicare patient (patients aged over 65) without focusing on a specific hospital ownership by also targeting private hospitals.",

Most hospitals and medical schools affiliated with the PLA are considered to be of a high quality and provide services to political leaders. 1 that have not yet been classified. The \"non-profit\" category mainly consists of organizations owned by government and companies (available data do not permit a disaggregation of the non-profit category by ownership) This fragmented structure is a hurdle to the implementation of any hospital reform, with four main ministries involved: the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security (MoHRSS), the Ministry of Finance (MoF) and obviously the Ministry of Health (MoH). These ministries do not have the same objectives. As a consequence, healthcare suppliers do not respond to the same incentives, which leads to a lack of co-ordination between healthcare providers. The effect of the reforms implemented may be affected by this multiplicity of governing bodies.",

In China, as in many other Asian countries, patients do not consult doctors in their doctor's office-outside any healthcare facilities-but in the hospital outpatient department. Prescriptions are given at the end of the consultation by default (patients are not asked if they want to purchase them). The total cost is the sum of the price of the consultation and that of the prescribed medicine. Patients do not have an explicit choice in not accepting the doctor's prescription. In this context, prescription prices can be varied in order to compensate for the fall in the hospital's central funding. This practice has been severely questioned during the recent healthcare reforms in China. Prescriptions currently account for about half of healthcare expenditure. The overprescription of medicine and the over-use of high-tech equipment for diagnostic purposes have often been identified as the cause of the rapid increase in healthcare expenditure (Eggleston et al., 2008a 8 ; 9 . The current healthcare system has been judged to be both too costly and more sophisticated than is medically necessary (World Bank, 2004 10 ; Blumenthal and Hsiao, 2005 11 ).

For instance, two counties in Shaanxi province adopted a fixed-price reimbursement system for some selected THCs and selected county hospitals according to specific criteria. 32 Some providers moved from a FFS service to a prospective payment system but not in conjunction with a public insurance scheme. In Heilongjiang province, by the end of 2000, 16 hospitals started to use a DRG-based payment system.

Nonetheless, the average size of private hospitals is much smaller than public hospitals. In 2008, the average number of inpatient beds for a private hospital was 42, which is in sharp contrast to the average number of 228 beds for a public hospital. 35 Recently, when classifying hospitals by their ownership, 58% of the hospitals in China are public, including state-owned and indirectly stateowned ones; the remaining 42% are private. In terms of level, according to the official hospital classification, the percentage of publicly owned hospitals by admissions is 96% for Level 3 and 91% for Level 2 hospitals. As a result, 90% of Chinese patients choose to visit public hospitals. Private hospitals in China only account for around 10% of the service volume and for 14% of beds while being operated at a lower level (Fig. 4.4) . 36 The picture is quite the opposite in the United States, where public hospitals make up 15% of total hospitals and only 27% of patient visits. 37 Nonetheless, the private hospital sector has been steadily increasing over the past few years.

Using competition between public and private sectors to better regulate hospital care is also increasingly popular in a number of European countries (e.g. Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and France). In China, the 12th Five Year Plan (2012-2016) and the 13th Five Year Plan (2016-2020) emphasize the development of private hospitals. Until then, setting up a private healthcare structure had been legally possible for two decades, but almost impossible in practice, in particular due to the difficulties of hiring medically qualified personnel. 39 Private hospitals have been addressing, as a priority, three markets segments: high-end healthcare for expats and the affluent local population, healthcare targeted to very specific pathologies and finally healthcare in direct competition with that offered by public hospitals.",

This difficulty in attracting patients seems hard to understand in the context of dissatisfaction over the service provided by public hospitals, but it actually sheds light on the priority criteria of patients/customers.

            "text": "As mentioned previously, recruitment of highly skilled professionals is one of the main obstacles to the development of private hospitals. The status of physicians in public hospitals, the benefits it brings and the additional wages received in various forms are often roadblocks to a migration to a private structure. 41 A 2010 McKinsey report entitled \"China Healthcare Reform\" gives the example of Beijing municipality. It addresses Community Healthcare Centres 42 (CHCs) but the configuration is identical for private hospitals: \"A few cities have tried to force more patients to go to CHCs, but these efforts have generally been unsuccessful. In January 2010, for example, one local government implemented a policy of requiring patients with certain chronic diseases to be treated at a CHC before they could receive care at a class III hospital. However, the local department of health withdrew this policy one month later, saying that the quality of the CHCs needed to be improved before the policy could be implemented.\" 43 The status and financial obstacles to hiring well-known professionals in private hospitals creates a vicious circle. As they do not manage to hire renowned physicians, private hospitals are obliged to hire young doctors with little experience. For both patients and professionals, this type of structure tends to become a second choice, when public hospitals are not an option. The story of An Hua and Li Peng provides a good example. They are reputed physicians in a Level 1 hospital in Beijing. They confided that working in a private structure could resolve their current, difficult, working conditions. Where they work, they have to deal with an extended number of working hours, an excessive number of patients and a patienthospital staff antagonistic climate. However, according to them, the size of private facilities is too small to attract a sufficient number of patients; the healthcare equipment is too limited; and the professional environment does not provide a sufficiently stimulating setting in which to work and grow. 44 This difficulty in recruitment is a recurring theme mentioned by professionals as well as academics. Dr. Wang Zhen, from the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS) gives the example of the creation of a private hospital in Shenzhen in 2012. It was a showcase collaboration between Hong Kong University (HKU) and the Shenzhen municipality. In 2015, this state of the art facility has not managed to fill all the physician positions. Out of 300 full-time positions, 100 are yet to be filled, to a point where it is seriously considering shift the establishment to a public status to solve the recruitment issue. 45 In parallel, another obstacle to the development of private hospitals is the restrictive conditions on the reimbursement of healthcare expenses by public insurance. This does not include the reimbursement of healthcare in private facilities. However, a main part of the population can only afford to get healthcare access using public insurance. As a consequence, the restrictive rule of public insurance excludes a large part of the population from access to private facilities. Recently, in some cases and in some areas, expenses in private facilities have been partially reimbursed by public health insurance. 46 It would be interesting to assess the effect of such a change on the individual's preference in the choice of healthcare providers.",

Her Weibo blog (Chinese equivalent of Twitter) has more than 3 million followers. On it, she has been describing her hesitation about leaving the public sector, her difficulties after crossing the bridge, but also the fulfillment it created for her. 47 Yu Ying, who had chosen \"Emergency Room superwoman\" for her pseudoname, is one of the few professionals to have left a Level 3 hospital to create a private medical centre. When she decided to leave her public hospital, her objective was to open her clinic in Beijing city, within the Fifth Ring Road. However, as she explained, this was not as easy as expected. A series of administrative constraints and barriers prevented her from opening a centre there. All her efforts failed. Having resigned from her previous hospital and given up her civil servant status, returning to the public sector was no longer an option. She decided to take her chance in Chengdu, Sichuan province, where she tried again to open a private clinic providing the most basic medical services. She failed again. During this time, she used her Weibo blog to explain part of her difficulties and the obstacles encountered along the way. When I interviewed her, the term \"bribery\" was never mentioned. As she said, she was able to explain her disappointment without going too far into detail about the local administrative process. In March 2014, she used her Weibo account to explicitly address the authorities about her situation asking, \"Which deputy of the National People's Congress can tell me why it is so difficult for a doctor, who has worked in the country's top-grade hospital for 12 years and has held a doctorate degree after eight years of professional medical education, to open a regular clinic through formal channels?\" 48 The timing was perfect. It was between the plenary session of the National People's Congress and the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, allowing a strong echo to her protest. The outcome was finally positive, even though she had to drop the idea of setting up her own facility. She is now the CEO of a private general clinic in Beijing city run by the Amcare group, 49 a public-private partnership joint venture, two and a half years after having resigned from a top public hospital. Despite her 3 million fans, she has to struggle to both promote the quality of a market-oriented institution and recruit staff members from big public hospitals.",

In 2014, US-based Warburg Pincus LLC invested $100 million in Beijingbased AmCare Women's and Children's Hospital to support its expansion. Today AmCare accounts for about half of the high-end healthcare market for women and children in Beijing, which is now dominated by private hospitals. 51 According to the Roland Berger report illustrated in Fig 4. 6, \"investors with various backgrounds are entering China's private hospital market. Foreign hospital chain investors, such as Chindex have built up high-end chain hospitals in smaller size in China.

The other is a progovernment group that advocates the need for a large government role in the production and distribution of health services. The latter prioritize issues of equity or fairness and aim at reducing social inequities. Depending on the period, each school of thought has had the upper hand in the direction given to reform.
