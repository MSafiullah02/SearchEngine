According to data from Venture Scanner, from 2010 through the end of 2019\u2014a period we refer to as the \u201cFinTech Revolution\u201d\u2014more than $165.5 billion poured into FinTech companies. FinTech is still an area that is not well understood and, certainly, this is an area that may be overlooked by investors who are looking to diversify into non-standard industry sectors. In this article, we build a conceptual framework that we believe can be used by investors who are looking for value in the growth of the FinTech sector. We begin by defining FinTech and then proceed to establish a taxonomy of the different areas within FinTech which we refer to as our \u201cFinTech Ecosystem.\u201d This conceptual framework can be used by investors seeking to diversify their allocation to alternative investments by identifying FinTech companies with the most promising areas and/or technologies (what we refer to as FinTech verticals and horizontals, respectively). Thus, investors can develop a strategy akin to allocating across sectors along the different FinTech verticals or obtaining more broad-based coverage by investing in the emerging technologies themselves (i.e., FinTech horizontals).\n",

Digital transformation, as we apply it, relies on a catalyst. The catalyst that really thrust FinTech innovations into the limelight was the Global Financial Crisis (GFC). The catalyst that will ensure that the most promising FinTech innovations are more widely adopted and that the ones that do not provide a solution to consumers and businesses will fall by the wayside is the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, the idea of digital transformation allows us to highlight the delicate risk-reward balance in FinTech. While it may be the case that funding was plentiful and valuations were frothy over the past few years, the market correction that started in the first quarter of 2020 has put into motion the kind of economic Darwinism that we saw when the Dot-Com bubble burst in 2001\u20132002. Very few would argue that society has benefitted from the exponential growth in e-commerce and technology since the early 2000s, but the bursting of the bubble ensured that smart capital went to the most promising ideas, and that is what is likely to happen in FinTech over the next couple of years.",

Pure technology companies that historically have had nothing to do with finance\u2014software development firms, hardware manufacturers, e-commerce companies, mobile technology, and data analytics platforms\u2014are seeking to take business away from banks, asset management firms, brokerage firms, insurance companies, and other household names that have provided these financial services for decades (even centuries for some).

Examples of these types of FinTech companies in this space include Monzo, Revolut, and Starling Bank in the UK, as well as Chime, Simple, and Varo Money in the USA. The rise of these challenger banks and neo-banks over the last decade is no coincidence. As we will discuss in the section describing the FinTech Revolution, the lack of trust and confidence in the big banks after the GFC sowed the seeds for today\u2019s FinTech innovations. However, in the latest crisis during the COVID-19 pandemic, bank customers are falling back on the brands that they have come to trust over the course of their lives and seem less inclined to use a start-up company for their primary banking needs.",

This is all within the realm of digital transformation, the concept we utilize below, and could play out in one of three ways. First, it could provide headwinds to the growth of neo-banks and challenger banks ultimately leading to a shortage of funds and their demise. Second, it could accelerate partnerships between FinTech start-ups in banking and the traditional or incumbent banks (even outright acquisitions of neo-banks/challenger banks by the big global banks and larger regional banks). Third, it could play to the favor of FinTech start-ups in banking as customers of the big banks become frustrated with subpar service, technical glitches, and user experience at the incumbent, thereby driving more money back into the neo-banks and challenger banks.",

The third category represents a new mechanism for borrowing and lending. Initially, P2P lenders provided a platform to allow individual borrowers to enter their funding needs and then, instead of going to a bank or other lender for a loan, the funds are borrowed directly from other individuals or groups of individuals that are looking for alternative places to invest, rather than buying stocks or bonds or putting their funds into a savings accounts. Hence, P2P lenders matched borrowers who require funds with \u201cpeer\u201d lenders, or individual investors. This is an example of disintermediation,2 which is an underlying theme in the economics of FinTech that should be considered when evaluating business plans of innovative startups.",

A very small portion of their funds are coming from individual investors in the form of micro-loans, but rather the loans tend to be funded by warehouse credit facilities from large financial institutions and then sold off either as whole-loans or bundled together into asset-backed securities. As a result, P2P lenders are more commonly known now as Marketplace Lenders (or MPLs). This reversed the practice of disintermediation, a term referred to as reintermediation. An innovative firm falling somewhere in between our categorization of an online lender and a MPL is CommonBond.3 That firm helps college graduates refinance student loans at competitive rates using technology, Big Data, algorithmic risk models, and the securitization market.",

Yearly amounts spiked in 2018 with over $1.4 billion being raised in that year alone, almost twice what was raised the previous year. The next year is likely to be critical for digital wealth management for at least three reasons. First, retail solutions in the digital wealth management vertical\u2014including the companies we named above\u2014are growing in popularity and not just with the digitally native demographics (millennials and Gen-Z) but also with older wealthier clients who have come to accept these products. Second, stay-at-home measures make using a digital wealth management solution more attractive during the COVID-19 pandemic as clients are limited in having in-person meetings with their financial advisors and are more likely to use online/digital solutions. Both of those could provide some support for digital asset management businesses. Yet, lastly, one counterpoint to these positive factors is that robo-advisory start-ups such as Wealthfront, Betterment, SigFig, and Acorns have never been through a bear market. Typically, they invest in broad-based ETFs, so their performance should not lag the market as a whole too much, but it will still be a challenge for them to prove to their clients and investors that they can weather a downturn.",

In Fig. 1, this is labeled \u201cemerging technologies\u201d and falls under the Internet-of-Things or IoT. The idea is that from data obtained from wearable sensors (e.g., a FitBit or Apple Watch) or from the dashboard of an automobile (Progressive and State Farm offer these dongles that attach under the car\u2019s dashboard, referred to as an onboard diagnostic port), insurance companies have much more access to real-time and near-continuous data about our health, driving habits, and other behaviors. This, in turn, can allow insurance companies to dynamically reprice insurance policies: safer and healthier behavior (working out regularly or driving under the speed limit) can lead to reduced life insurance or car insurance premiums, respectively. Insurance companies do not make the use of these trackers mandatory but rather give the consumer the option to use them. We see this as having the potential to exacerbate the problem of adverse selection that already plagues insurance markets.

            "text": "In this article, we developed a conceptual framework for understanding how technology is transforming financial services or FinTech. Our framework is predicated upon two conceptual underpinnings, both of which can be used by investors who are looking for value in the growth of FinTech in the future. The first is our FinTech Ecosystem which views technological innovations across different sectors within finance\u2014the FinTech verticals\u2014as well as the different functional areas and emerging technologies that tend to span all areas\u2014the FinTech horizontals. We discussed how FinTech verticals can be used to perform a kind of sector analysis when seeking FinTech exposure as an alternative investment. Over the course of this discussion, we provided examples of fund flows from venture capitalists and other investors into start-ups across each of the FinTech verticals. We also provided some insight as to where we feel the next opportunities are going to be, with InsurTech topping the list. We then discussed some of the exciting emerging technologies that are being applied to financial services and how investors might achieve more broad-based exposure to those technologies.",

            "text": "The second conceptual underpinning supporting our framework is what we call the Digital Transformation Triangle. We explained how FinTech essentially \u201crose from the ashes\u201d of the GFC in 2008\u20132009. That same framework can be used to predict which areas of FinTech innovation are going to thrive coming out of the COVID-19 pandemic and which may fall by the wayside. Using the Digital Transformation Triangle, the \u201cPeople\u201d vertex has clearly been impacted by the catalyst of stay-at-home measures and social distancing. What this has done is force people to bank, invest, and pay their bills remotely rather than face-to-face with human representatives. The \u201cOrganization\u201d vertex is being impacted by the perpetual game of tug-of-war that is being played between financial incumbents that are trying the best they can to bring their digital offering up to speed to accommodate the increased demand for online and mobile products and FinTech start-ups that have the digital products with superior user experience but lack the brand recognition. At the \u201cTechnology\u201d vertex, we are likely to see more of the emerging technologies highlighted in our FinTech Ecosystem moving more into the mainstream. Another trend at the \u201cTechnology\u201d vertex is the more seamless integration of financial services with e-commerce apps (curbside pickup and contactless delivery) and healthcare. It will be interesting to see how this plays out, but there will be no shortage of opportunities for forward-thinking investors who are looking to capitalize on innovation and help bring the next generation of technologies to the market.",
