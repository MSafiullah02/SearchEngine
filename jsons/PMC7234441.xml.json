We included weekend/holiday as a covariate to account for differences in consult requests between business days and weekends. We excluded specialty areas with less than 20 e-consult requests, specialty areas that did not offer both an active e-consult and ambulatory consult option, and psychiatry as it included some requests for behavioral health resources without a need for specialist guidance.",

While both types of consult requests declined after March 11, the ambulatory consults declined more than the e-consults resulting in an increase in absolute e-consult proportion from 8.5 to 19.6%. After adjusting for weekend and secular trend, we found e-consult proportion increased by 5% (95% CI 2\u20137%) daily from pre-emergency declaration levels (Fig. 2).",
