Termed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by the World Health Organization (WHO), it has spawned a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) [7]. At present, there are >100 affected countries and districts [8]. SARS-CoV-2 is the seventh member of the enveloped RNA human coronavirus (HCoV) family, which also includes HCoV-229E, \u2212OC43, -NL63, -HKU1, SARS-CoV, and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) [9]. Earlier data have shown that adult patients with COVID-19 present with fever, dry cough, dyspnea, fatigue, and lymphopenia. Serious pneumonia may also ensue, more often in elderly adult men and those with chronic comorbidities, posing greater risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome and even death [[1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6]].",

The epidemiologic criteria were as follows: (1) Travel or residence in Wuhan area or other areas showing continuous local spread within 2 weeks of onset; (2) Exposure within prior 2 weeks to fever or respiratory symptoms from Wuhan area or other areas where local spread was ongoing; (3) Close contact with confirmed or suspected cases of COVID-19 within 2 weeks of onset; (4) Disease clusters, comprised of patients (other than the child in question) with fever or respiratory symptoms suggesting or identified as COVID-19; and (5) Newborns of mothers with suspected or confirmed COVID-19. Qualifying clinical manifestations were as follows: (1) Fever, fatigue, dry cough, or some with no fever (2) Abnormal chest imaging (X-ray or computed tomography [CT]); (3) Normal or low total leukocytes counts or lymphopenia in the early phase of disease.",

Pathogen detection improved as the outbreak took hold, so reports of pediatric infections began to mount [[12], [13], [14], [15], [16]]. Herein, we have analysed 16 patients of Xiangyang city with laboratory confirmed COVID-19, 12 of whom had immediate family members (sometimes two or more) harbouring the same illness. It is suggested that the extent of epidemics in children reflects the dynamics of family units. Although avoidance of public places and social gatherings under our national prevention and control policies effectively reduced overall morbidity, children clearly rely on parental care. Close contact within the family is thus the likely mode of SARS-CoV-2 infection in children of Xiangyang city, similar to SARS and MERS [18,19]. We are subsequently reminded that prevention and control of pediatric infections is indeed a family effort. Respiratory isolation, hand hygiene, and surface disinfection are all simple yet important preventive measures. Aside from the current lack of medical masks suitable for children, it is quite unrealistic for infants or toddlers to don masks, and many older children are incapable of self-discipline entailed in viral combat. While tending to their own obligations, parents must then do the same for their children, insisting on respiratory protection and hand hygiene.",

The median incubation time (15.5 days) was also lengthy, enabling a prolonged period of concealment, and four patients had demonstrable CT abnormalities. Such departure from customary adult presentations compounds other diagnostic obstacle. We have not known clearly the pathogenic features of SARS-CoV-2, so by using chest CT, we can effectively identify patients with pneumonia, determine severity of lung lesions and isolate the source of infection [15]. Whereas in our study, eight asymptomatic patients with or without chest CT abnormalities didn\u2019t show any sign of deterioration during the course and their outcomes were good. Hence, we should keep an eye on illness and think twice about CT scans when necessary. Regular use of NAT may be a workable approach to detecting asymptomatic carriers in family units. The rest of the children (50%) examined presented with fever and cough, much like first symptoms of adult infection [[1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6]]. However, fever in children was of shorter duration and not as high (maximum, <38.6 \u00b0C). None of them had early respiratory tract symptoms, and no dyspnea or extrapulmonary issues emerged in the course of disease. We thus concluded that COVID-19 in children is an asymptomatic or mild clinical illness.",

Lymphopenia reflects consumption of lymphocyte by SARS-CoV-2 and signals severe disease [1,3,4], which is rare in children.

Lesions in children commonly occupy lung periphery, sitting close to the pleura. In adults, lesions are likewise shown pleural distributions, positioned at interlobar fissures. However, those in children seem to align with bronchovascular bundles, simulating changes of bronchopneumonia; and although GGOs and consolidation are shared features, single lung involvement by few nodular or small/patchy changes are characteristic of children. Furthermore, the GGO halos are diminutive, consolidation is limited, and air bronchograms are unusual. Adult patients, in contrast, have bilateral broad-ranging lung changes, mainly large patches with paving-stone pattern and halo or reverse-halo signs. These phenomena suggest a more robust inflammatory response in adults, more so than in children. Extrapulmonary manifestations, such as nodal enlargement and pleural effusions that appear in adults are actually rare or absent in children. Finally, the pulmonary lesions in the pediatric patients tend to resolve after treatment, without sequelae, and not reappear; whereas, fibrous cords and secondary diseases may develop in adults. By comparison then, children with COVID-19 have atypical clinical symptoms, showing nonspecific and inconsequential CT changes of lung.",

Both SARS-CoV [21] and SARS-CoV-2 gain entry to airway cells via angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors [22,23], triggering massive inflammatory cytokine release and causing tissue necrosis. The resultant immune imbalance may be catastrophic, culminating in systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) or ARDS. It is still unclear whether the maturity, functionality, or affinity of ACE2 receptors is lower in children than in adults, or whether other mechanisms (eg, accessory receptors) are operant, explaining the many discrepancies in pediatric and adult disease expression. The need for more research is urgent.",

Our early inexperience in treating of children during the outbreak prompted some questionable decisions, based on adult guidelines [24]. We now recognize the innocuous course that most children without underlying ailments will follow, so antivirals are not warranted. However, the principles of traditional Chinese medicine are worthy of further study, although recommended by guidelines and experience [17,24,25].
