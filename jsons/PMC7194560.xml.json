About a decade later, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS CoV) was diagnosed in Saudi Arabia [4]. Soon after the emergence of SARS and MERS CoVs, they spread to outside of the countries of its origin, causing major world-wide concerns [5,6]. Lastly, COVID-19 emerged in Wuhan, China.
