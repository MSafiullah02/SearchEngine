            "text": "Coronaviruses (CoVs), a genus of the Coronaviridae family, order Nidovirales, are enveloped, positive-stranded RNA viruses that have been identified in humans and a variety of animals, including pigs, mice, cows, rats, dogs, cats, rabbits, horses, bats, whales, and birds, and they cause highly prevalent diseases, including respiratory, enteric, cardiovascular, and neurological disorders (Masters, 2006). The genomic RNA of CoV is 27\u201332-kb in size, and it is capped and polyadenylated. The 5\u2032 two-thirds of the CoV genome encodes the replicase genes, which are translated into two large polyproteins (1a and 1ab) that are processed into 15 or 16 non-structural proteins (Nsps) via proteolytic cleavage. The 3\u2032 one-third of the CoV genome encodes several structural proteins, such as the surface spike glycoprotein (S), small envelop (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins. Additional accessory protein genes are located in the 3\u2032 part of the genome in a CoV species-specific position. In most Beta and all gammacoronaviruses, the S protein is cleaved into two polypeptides, S1 and S2, by a trypsin-like host protease (Cavanagh et al., 1986). The S1 domain is the most divergent region of the molecule, both across and within coronavirus genera. It is generally believed that the S1 subunit contains the receptor-binding activity of the S protein, carries virus-neutralizing and serotype-specific determinants, and is a determinant of cell tropism. Because of its genomic plasticity, coronaviruses are characterized by a high potential for evolution, adaption, and interspecies jumping (Woo et al., 2009).",

Since IBV was first described in 1936, many serotypes and variants have been isolated worldwide. They arose as a result of the point mutations, insertions, or/and deletions in the genome, especially in the S1 subunit of the S protein (Cavanagh, 2007). In addition, like other coronaviruses, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV (Stavrinides and Guttman, 2004, Hon et al., 2008), human CoV NL63 (Pyrc et al., 2006), human CoV HKU1 (Woo et al., 2006), and the recently identified Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (Sabir et al., 2016), recombination is another very important feature that is thought to contribute to the emergence of novel IBV pathotypes, serotypes/genotypes, and variants (Kusters et al., 1989, Wang et al., 1993).",

In 1956, Jungherr was the first to demonstrate that IBV was heterogeneous by isolating an IBV in Connecticut, USA, that did not cross-protect chickens against challenge with the original Massachusetts (Mass) isolate (Jungherr et al., 1956); since then, dozens of IBV serotypes and variants have been isolated worldwide (de Wit et al., 2011). 793/B (also named 4/91 or CR88) is among the most well characterized and important IBV serotypes that emerged in the UK and France in the 1990s, and it has been associated with major illnesses and economic impacts in apparently well-vaccinated flocks (Gough et al., 1992, Parsons et al., 1992). The pathology caused by 793/B is not typical of other IBV infections, as it was originally associated with mortality in breeders, scouring in broilers, and possibly muscle myopathy under field conditions. It is interesting that unlike some of the IBV serotypes that remain localized, 793/B type viruses quickly spread to many parts of the world (Xu et al., 2007), but we do not know why this occurred. In addition, the 793/B type virus continues to be a problem in many parts of the world, but its structure and antigenicity do not appear to have changed greatly (de Wit et al., 2011).",

Since then, some other strains of this virus also have been isolated and identified (Xu et al., 2007, Han et al., 2009). Interestingly, we recently isolated a virulent, nephropathogenic 793/B type virus, which was found to have emerged from a recombination event between the 4/91 vaccine strain and an LX4 type (also known as QX-like) virus (Liu et al., 2013). More recently, we isolated another 793/B genotype virus, which also originated from a recombinant event that resulted in a serotype shift (Zhang et al., 2015). These results indicate that the 793/B type might be becoming a major concern to the poultry industry in China, although the origin and evolution of the virus is not clear and little is known about the influence of the genotype on the ecology of other IBVs. In the present study, 20 793/B isolates were selected by screening 418 IBVs (Chen et al., 2015) that were isolated from chickens during our continuous surveillance activities for IBV in China from 2009 to 2014. The molecular characteristics, antigenicity, and pathogenicity of the 20 viruses were investigated to further elucidate the origin and evolution of IBV isolates genotypically related to 793/B viruses in China.",

A commercial 793/B genotype vaccine, the 4/91 strain, was used for the viral genomic sequencing, virus-neutralization, and vaccination-challenge tests. Two LX4 type IBV strains, ck/CH/LHLJ/04 V and ck/CH/LDL/091022, were also used for virus-neutralization and/or vaccination-challenge tests. The viral stocks of these viruses were prepared by inoculating the viruses into embryonated SPF chicken eggs via the allantoic cavity and collecting the infectious allantoic fluid 48 h post-inoculation as previously described (Liu and Kong, 2004). The titers of the viruses were determined using previously described methods (Reed and Muench, 1938).",

Briefly, viral RNA was extracted from 200 \u03bcl of viral stocks using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and re-dissolved in 80 \u03bcl of RNase-free water. RT and PCR were performed using a PrimeScript II High Fidelity One Step RT-PCR kit (TaKaRa, Shiga, Japan) with twenty overlapping primers (Zhang et al., 2015). Primers sequences, amplification and sequencing conditions are available from the author upon request. The 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 ends of the viral genomes were confirmed by rapid amplification of cDNA ends using a 3\u2032/5\u2032 RACE kit (TaKaRa) as previously described (Liu et al., 2013). The PCR products were detected by electrophoresis of a 1% agarose gel and visualization under UV light after ethidium bromide staining. Then, the PCR products were cloned into a pMD 18-T vector (TaKaRa). Sanger sequencing was performed (Big Dye Terminator) and three to five clones were sequenced to determine a consensus sequence for any given genomic region.",

The selected avian coronavirus reference strains and their accession numbers are shown in Fig. 1\n. To detect possible recombination events between our 20 isolates and the other viruses, a sliding window analysis was performed using a nucleotide alignment of the available genome sequences that was generated by ClustalX version 1.83 and edited manually with BioEdit version 7.1.3 (Lasergene Corp, Madison, WI, USA).

However, some isolates, including, ck/CH/LGD/120723, ck/CH/LGD/120724, ck/CH/LGD/090907, and ck/CH/LSD/111235, as well as the reference strain Deyang-06, showed various topologies compared with those of other 793/B viruses, although they still clustered together with other 793/B strains in the phylogenetic analysis (Fig. 1). Nucleotide and amino acid similarities also confirmed these results (data not shown). Furthermore, insertions and deletions were also found at different positions between amino acid residues 10 and 135 in the S1 subunit of the S protein in the different viruses. In addition, 19 of the 30 Chinese 793/B-like strains have a Ser residue at position 95, seven have an Ala, and five have other residues at this position (Fig. 1). It was reported that virus replication in chickens and embryonated eggs was favored by a Ser or Ala residue at this position (Xu et al., 2015). These results indicate that IBV isolates genotypically related to 793/B that are circulating in chicken flocks in China likely originated from different ancestors and/or evolved differently as they adapted to, and spread among, different chicken flocks. In addition, the recombination events have been detected in the S1 genes by the network tree constructed between some of the IBV isolates and reference strains (Supplemental Fig. 1).",

Of the 11 mutations in the S gene that differentiate the pathogenic 4/91 strain and the 4/91 vaccine strain, the 12 isolates shared eight mutations with the 4/91 vaccine strain and only one with the pathogenic 4/91 strain (Table 1\n), suggesting that this region of the 12 isolates was more similar to that of the 4/91 vaccine strain than that of the pathogenic 4/91 strain. The ck/CH/LSD/110857 isolate (designed as type II), which differed from the other 793/B genotype viruses, had at least 98.8% nucleotide homology to the 4/91 vaccine strain and the type I viruses. Of the 11 aforementioned mutations, ck/CH/LSD/110857 shared 10 mutations with the 4/91 vaccine strain and only one mutation with the pathogenic 4/91 strain (Table 1).

The results suggested that ck/CH/LSD/110857 arose from recombination events between the 4/91 vaccine strain and another vaccine strain, H120 (Fig. 4\nA and Supplemental Fig. 2A). Two recombination sites in the genome of the ck/CH/LSD/110857 isolate, which are located at nt 9548\u20139560 and 15594\u201315602 in the Nsp5- and Nsp13-encoding genes, respectively (Supplemental Fig. 2B), were identified. In addition, as illustrated in Fig. 4B and Supplemental Fig. 3B, isolate ck/CH/LGD/120723 originated from recombination events, and 4/91- and GX-LY9-like viruses served as the parental strains. Two recombination breakpoints (nt 21043\u201321048 and 22130\u201322143) were confirmed to be located in the S1 gene of the ck/CH/LGD/120723 isolate (Supplemental Fig. 2B).",

Chicks were monitored daily for clinical signs. Abnormal respiratory sounds, called snicks, made by all of the birds were counted by three people over a 2-min period. Birds were checked individually for tracheal rales, nasal discharge, watery eyes, and wheezing (Cavanagh et al., 2005). The results are shown in Table 3\n. No clinical signs were observed in the chickens that were challenged with the ck/CH/LSD/110851 and ck/CH/LSD/110857 isolates, which are similar to the 4/91 vaccine strain, or in the negative control group. In contrast, the remaining three isolates, ck/CH/LHB/130575, ck/CH/LGD/090907, and ck/CH/LGD/120723, induced obvious respiratory signs in some or all of the challenged chickens. Some challenged chickens died during the experiment, with gross lesions mainly confined to the kidneys. The kidney parenchyma was pale, swollen, and mottled, and tubules and urethras were distended and contained uric acid crystals (Supplemental Fig. 4A). Immunohistochemistry (IHC) results revealed that IBV-positive cells were present in the kidneys of the dead chickens (Supplemental Fig. 4B). These results identified these three IBV isolates as nephropathogenic strains. The clinical signs in inoculated birds tended to disappear gradually after 15 days post-infection (dpi). The seroconversion in chickens inoculated with ck/CH/LSD/110851and ck/CH/LSD/110857 was similar to that in chickens inoculated with the 4/91 vaccine strain, which was later than that induced by the remaining three isolates (Table 3).

As expected, none of the chickens in the negative control group were positive for virus isolation. Interestingly, virus shedding in the cloaca of the vaccinated chickens after challenge was different from that in the respiratory tract. The 4/91 vaccine virus could not be recovered from the respiratory tract after 16 dpi. However, it could be recovered from the cloaca after 20 dpi, and it could be recovered at 40 dpi in some chickens (Table 5\n); the viruses recovered from the cloaca were a mixture of the 4/91 vaccine and the challenge viruses (data not shown). In addition, the 20-day-old chickens showed slight resistance to the challenge viruses compared with 1-day-old chickens, although the pathogenicity of each virus was similar in these two age groups. Nearly all of the 20-day-old chickens seroconverted by 8 dpc with each of the viruses, which was earlier than that of the 1-day-old chickens; none of the birds in the negative control group seroconverted (Table 4).",

While spreading, most RNA viruses, such as IBV, may undergo a high rate of genetic change that contributes to diverse subpopulations of the virus that continually emerge to form new variants of existing strains, as well as completely new types of the virus. For IBV, it is also believed that the spread of the live vaccine strain may serve as a parental virus, thereby driving the generation of recombinant viruses, especially where multiple IBV genotypes might be involved (Liu et al., 2013), as the results herein suggest. Hence, live vaccine use should be ideally restricted to situations in which there is a known protective benefit (Farsang et al., 2002).",

In China, this genotype emerged at the end of 20th century; however, use of the 4/91 vaccine strain began by the mid-1990s. Recent studies showed that the 793/B type has become a major concern to the poultry industry in China in recent years (Liu et al., 2013). To elucidate the origin and evolution of IBV isolates genotypically related to 793/B in China, we selected 20 IBVs that were isolated from 2009 to 2014 in China, and we investigated their genetic, antigenic, and pathogenic characteristics by comparing them with those of the 4/91 vaccine strain. Based on a sequence comparison and a phylogenetic analysis (Fig. 1) of the S1 gene, it appears that the IBV isolates genotypically related to 793/B in China exhibited diversity in recent years, which is consistent with previous findings (Farsang et al., 2002). A sequence comparison and a phylogenetic analysis (Fig. 3) using complete genomic sequences confirmed this result, and a significant signal of phylogenetic incongruence between the S1 gene and the complete genomic sequences in some of the isolates indicated the possible occurrence of recombination events during the origin of these viruses.",

Hence, based on the mild clinical signs, the virus shedding in SPF chickens, and the seroconversion in the animal experiments, as well as their close genetic relationships, most of the isolates might be vaccine-derived strains, although a direct comparison has not been conducted because the pathogenic 793/B strain was not available in our laboratory. Furthermore, the fact that, in most samples, the IBVs were isolated in the first egg passage also supports this hypothesis, as vaccine-derived viruses are more easily isolated because they have adapted to grow in embryonated eggs (Martin et al., 2014). It is possible that the use of the 4/91-like vaccine in chickens in China may have contributed to the spread of the isolates genotypically related to 793/B. As expected, the representative strain of the 12 isolates, ck/CH/LSD/110851, had the same serotype as the 4/91 vaccine strain, and vaccination with the 4/91 vaccine strain provided compete protection against a challenge with the ck/CH/LSD/110851 isolate.",

This mechanism promotes homologous recombination events (McKinley et al., 2011). Recombination contributes to the genetic diversity of coronaviruses, and it can lead to the emergence of new viruses and outbreaks of new diseases (Makino et al., 1986, Woo et al., 2009). In this study, two classes of viruses genotypically related to 793/B were shown to have evolved from recombinant viruses. Isolate ck/CH/LSD/110857 was the first class, and it was predicted to have originated from two vaccine strains, the Mass type H120 and 793/B type 4/91 strains, which are the most commonly used vaccines in chicken flocks in China. The genome of this isolate acquired the 5\u2032 (5\u2032-untranslated region (UTR) to 5\u2032 part of the Nsp6 gene) and 3\u2032 parts of its genome (3\u2032 part of the Nsp13 gene to the 3\u2032-UTR) from the 4/91-like virus, which includes the S gene. Because the S gene contains the epitopes of the main antigenic viral protein and the diversity of which is thought to account for the level of serotypical variation, the serotype of the ck/CH/LSD/110857 isolate was the same as that of the 4/91-like ck/CH/LSD/110851 isolate and the 4/91 vaccine strain (the 793/B type). Consistent with this result, vaccination with the 4/91vaccine strain provided compete protection against challenge with the ck/CH/LSD/110857 isolate.",

            "text": "Interestingly, we found that many (seven of the 20) isolates emerged from recombination events between the 4/91 vaccine strain and IBV field strains circulating in China. Although the genomes of the seven isolates were diverse, which suggested that they have a varied history of evolution, they still have a similar phylogeny topology, indicating that they likely have the same origin. Analysis of the representative ck/CH/LGD/120723 isolate revealed that it acquired the 5\u2032 (5\u2032-UTR to 5\u2032 part of S1) and 3\u2032 parts of its genome (most regions of the 3\u2032 part of the S2 gene to the 3\u2032-UTR) from an GX-YL9-like virus, while only parts of the S1 gene and small parts of the S2 gene were acquired from a 4/91-like virus. It is reported that serotype differences among genetically distinct IBVs generally correlate with variations in the hypervariable regions of the S1 gene (Cavanagh, 2007), and that differences of as little as 5% between the S1 sequences of IBVs could result in poor cross-protection by currently used vaccines (Hofstad, 1981). In this study, the ck/CH/LGD/120723 isolate acquired HVR I and II of the S1 gene from a GX-YL9-like virus, as well as HVR III from a 4/91-like virus, suggesting that a recombination event in the S1 gene likely accounts for the change in serotype of the ck/CH/LGD/120723 isolate and the poor protection of the 4/91 vaccine strain against challenge with this isolate. IBV strains 4/91 and GX-YL-9 belong to different types and therefore, vaccination with 4/91 likely did not cross-protect chickens against challenge with GX-YL-9-like strain. This indicates that it is possible for a GX-YL9-like virus and the 4/91 vaccine strain to co-exist in a certain chicken flock, which is believed to be an important prerequisite for recombination between IBV strains in the field (Cavanagh, 2007). Importantly, the 4/91 vaccine strain is still commonly used in China, and GX-YL-9-like viruses are still circulating in China for a long time (Zhao et al., 2016); hence, more IB cases associated with ck/CH/LGD/120723-like viruses might be expected in the future. This was the case in the present study, as seven viruses, which emerged from recombination events between the 4/91 vaccine strain and a GX-YL-9-like virus, were isolated in different regions in different years in China. In addition, the results of this study emphasize that conclusions based on a single gene or partial gene segment analysis should be made cautiously, because the true origin and evolutionary history of an IBV can only be evaluated by an extensive, complete genome analysis (Reddy et al., 2015).",

Over the past 20 years, nephropathogenic IBV strains have emerged as the most predominant IBV strains in the poultry industry, and they were responsible for outbreaks of kidney disease on chicken farms in China (Xu et al., 2007). In this study, the third class of identified recombinant viruses was isolated from chickens that exhibited kidney diseases (Supplemental Table). Furthermore, two of the selected recombinant isolates were shown to be nephropathogenic to SPF chickens, as IBV-positive cells were observed in the kidneys of the dead chickens following challenge with these IBV isolates, as assessed by IHC, thereby demonstrating that the tissue tropism and pathogenicity of the naturally occurring recombinant viruses that we isolated were similar to those of their parental virus and differed from those of the 793/B type. Thus far, a conclusion had not been made about the pathogenicity determinants of IBV, although it was reported that they might be located in the 1a, S, M, and accessory proteins of some virus strains (Reddy et al., 2015). Only parts of the S1 gene were shared between the two recombinant viruses and the 4/91 vaccine strain, suggesting that the pathogenicity determinants of these strains were not likely to be located in this region of the S1 gene; the molecular basis of the nephropathogenicity of IBV will need to be elucidated by reverse genetics. For the ck/CH/LHB/130575 isolate, no chickens died after challenge, and we did not investigate the kidney tropism of this isolate. It was shown that the replicase gene of IBV is a pathogenicity determinant (Armesto et al., 2009); however, the ck/CH/LHB/130575 isolate shared very high nucleotide similarity to the aforementioned strains, indicating that a mutation(s) in the replicase gene likely accounted for its altered pathogenicity. Alternatively, the pathogenicity determinants of some IBV strains might be located in other regions of the genome (Reddy et al., 2015), although this will require further investigation. For the recombinant strain ck/CH/LSD/110857, the chickens from which the virus was isolated did not exhibit kidney diseases. It was not surprising to find that the ck/CH/LSD/110857 isolate was not pathogenic to SPF chickens, because this strain was predicted to have arisen from recombination events between two vaccine strains, H120 and 4/91.",
