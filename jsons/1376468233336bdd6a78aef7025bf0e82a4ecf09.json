Interleukin-22 (IL-22) plays a critical role in maintaining intestinal mucosal barrier function through repairing intestinal epithelial damage. However, little was known about the effects of IL-22 against apoptosis caused by toxins and infection of intestinal pathogens in the intestinal epithelium, especially in pigs. In this study, we had successfully used prokaryotic expression system to produce recombinant porcine interleukin-22. Meanwhile, purified rIL-22 could activate STAT3 signal pathway and have been demonstrated to be safe to IPEC-J2 cells by increasing E-cadherin expression, without proinflammatory cytokines changes. Furthermore, rIL-22 reversed apoptosis induced by deoxynivalenol (DON) and played a vital part in repairing the intestinal injury. We also found that rIL-22 stimulated epithelial cells to secrete pBD-1 against enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) K88 infection, as well as alleviating apoptosis ratio. This study provided a theoretical basis for curing intestinal inflammation caused by ETEC infection and epithelial apoptosis induced by DON with rIL-22 in pigs.",

IL-22 acts biology function via the signal transduction in immune response by heterodimeric receptor complex consisting of IL-22R1 and IL-10R2 (Witte et al., 2010) . In combined with receptor complex, IL-22 activates the receptor-associated Janus kinases, Jak1 and Tyk2, and then leads to the phosphorylation of STAT3 and activation of p38 mitogen activated protein kinase pathway (Lejeune et al., 2002) . IL-22 has been described as the cytokine of epithelium protection, which has been widely studied for its different effects on cell proliferation, tissue regeneration, cellular defense and inflammation (Lindemans et al., 2015) . Especially, IL-22 in the gut is able to stimulate intestinal epithelial cells to produce antimicrobial peptides, enhance the intestinal epithelial barrier of mucus and promote intestinal repair (Hou et al., 2018; Parks et al., 2015) . Pathogens such as enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) and mycotoxin in contaminated feed are destructive to intestinal epithelial cells, which cause enteritis and seriously threatens gut health of pigs (Alizadeh et al., 2015; Lee et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2018) .",

Pigs are the most sensitive species to DON, which can cause abdominal distress, diarrhea, vomiting and even shock or death (Pinton and Oswald, 2014) . Besides, DON can induce apoptosis and breakdown intestinal barrier integrity in epithelial cells (Akbari et al., 2014; Ma et al., 2012) , which increases the susceptibility of animals to intestinal pathogen infection (Antonissen et al., 2014) . Besides feeds, enteropathogens, such as enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) K88, commonly induce diarrhea in piglets, which cause mortality and reduce growth rate, resulting in heavy economic losses (Jin and Zhao, 2000) . Recent studies demonstrated that IL-22 could effectively suppress infection of several intestinal viruses through activation of STAT3 signaling (Xue et al., 2017) .Moreover, IL-22 also activated STAT3 to induce the expressions of transcription factors, such as Pou5f1, Sox2, and Nanog, and promoted tumor progression in human colorectal cancer cells (Koltsova and Grivennikov, 2014; Kryczek et al., 2014) . However, IL-22-STAT3 pathway plays a protective role in intestinal epithelium during colitis by promoting expression of genes involved in apoptosis, proliferation, migration, and survival (Akira, 2000; Chung et al., 2006) .",

Meanwhile, 100 ng/ml rIL-22 alleviated the reduced level of pBD-1 caused by ETEC K88 infection (P < 0.05) (Fig. 4b) . These results demonstrated that rIL-22 can induce epithelial cells to produce pBD-1 and reduce the adhesion of ETECK88. Meanwhile, we also found that the viability of cells infected ETEC K88 for 2.5 h decreased significantly, and 10 ng/ml and 100 ng/ml rIL-22 pretreatment decreased apoptosis ratio of intestinal epithelial cells induced by ETEC K88 significantly (P < 0.001) (Fig. 4c) .",

However, little is uncovered to the function of porcine IL-22, which may be a good alternative to prevent and cure porcine diarrhea. Previous research have found that IL-22 play an important role against the infection of enteric coronaviruses (Xue et al., 2017) . In this study, prokaryotic expression system was successfully used to produce recombinant protein rIL-22, which was able to lead to phosphorylation of STAT3 and rescue the apoptosis induced by DON. Combined with its safety on cell viability and balance proinflammatory cytokines expressions, rIL-22 is a novel idea to cure the vomit and apoptosis of intestinal epithelial cells induced by toxin.",

ETEC K88, is a vital pathogens, which caused serious intestinal disorder in piglets. IL-22 mainly actives STAT3 signal pathway that related to suppress apoptosis to maintain intestinal epithelial barrier function, ameliorate intestinal inflammation and prevent infection of gastrointestinal bacteria via regulation of antimicrobial peptides expression (Wittkopf et al., 2015) . Porcine intestinal epithelial cells could produce \u03b2-defensin to maintain the integrity of intestinal mucosal barrier (Mariani et al., 2009 ). \u03b2-defensin attenuated intestinal inflammation and mucosal lesions in dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) induced colitis and displayed broad antimicrobial activity against pathogenic intestinal bacteria (Veldhuizen et al., 2008; Wittkopf et al., 2015) . In our experiment, we found that rIL-22 significantly improved the expression of pBD-1 against the infection of ETEC K88, although the increase of pBD-2 was not obvious at statistical level. Researches showed that pBD-1 had a strong inhibitory activity against E. coli, S. typhimurium, L. monocytogenes, C. albicans and B. pertussis (Elahi et al., 2006; Shi et al., 1999) . It's possible that rIL-22 decreased the adhesion of ETEC K88 via antibacterial effect of pBD-1.",
