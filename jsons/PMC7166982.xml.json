The first RV was discovered in the 1950s, and approximately 100 RV serotypes were classified as RV\u2010A or \u2010B species by the early 1990s.1, 2, 3, 4 With the development of molecular diagnostic techniques, the RV\u2010C group was identified in 2006.5, 6 The RV genome consists of structural (VP4, VP2, VP3, and VP1) and nonstructural (2A, 2B, 2C, 3A, 3B, 3C, and 3D) regions flanked by 5\u2032\u2010 and 3\u2032\u2010untranslated regions (UTRs). Recently, a genotypic classification of RVs was proposed according to the sequence of VP1 or VP4/VP2, and more than 160 RVs have now been classified as RV\u2010A, \u2010B, or \u2010C species (http://www.picornaviridae.com/).7\n",

Many real\u2010time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT\u2010PCR) assays for detecting RVs have been described to generate sensitive and quantitative results as laboratory diagnostic methods14, 15; however, real\u2010time RT\u2010PCR methods require multiple steps, highly specialized technical skills, and take time to generate results (>1 hour). Loop\u2010mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), first reported in the early 2000s, is an isothermal nucleic acid amplification method, and a real\u2010time LAMP (RT\u2010LAMP) assay can be performed simply without the need for high\u2010precision instruments and can detect viral genomes within 30 minutes.16, 17, 18 A LAMP assay can be performed using fluorescent dyes for real\u2010time monitoring or for judgment by the naked eye,19, 20 while fluorescent dyes have a major limitation in that they can bind nonspecifically to double\u2010stranded DNA, such as primer\u2010dimers, leading to erroneous results.21 Previously, real\u2010time fluorescent RT\u2010LAMP was established to detect viral RNA using a quenching primer (QPrimer) or a quenching probe (QProbe). By using a QPrimer or QProbe, nonspecific reactions can be decreased and the target can be detected in a real\u2010time manner.22, 23 In this study, two assays were developed to detect RVs by a real\u2010time fluorescent RT\u2010LAMP method, and the competence of both assays was compared with real\u2010time RT\u2010PCR assays for the detection of RV infection using clinical specimens.",

Among nucleic acid amplification techniques, real\u2010time fluorescent RT\u2010LAMP can be performed simply by incubating the reaction tube at 63\u00b0C and completed within 30 minutes.22 Other than real\u2010time RT\u2010PCR and RT\u2010LAMP methods, nucleic acid sequence\u2010based amplification (NASBA) to detect RVs, has been reported.27, 28, 29, 30 Similar to RT\u2010LAMP, NASBA is an isothermal nucleic acid amplification method that can be performed without the need for expensive equipment. However, NASBA takes 2 hours to generate a result, and requires an annealing step at 65\u00b0C before an isothermal amplification step at a lower temperature.31 It has been more than a decade since NASBA assays for RV detection were reported, and it is still not certain whether these assays can detect recently circulating RVs, especially the recently identified RV\u2010Cs. More recently, reverse transcription strand invasion\u2010based ampli\ufb01cation (RT\u2010SIBA), which can be performed isothermally to detect RVs, has been reported32; however, this assay takes more than 1 hour to generate results and has only been evaluated with RV\u2010A and \u2010B, but not with RV\u2010C. Similar to NASBA assays, it is uncertain whether RT\u2010SIBA can detect RV\u2010Cs.",

In contrast, the assays failed to detect two RV\u2010A, 1 RV\u2010B, and 1 RV\u2010C species (Tables 2 and 3), which may have been caused by the presence of mismatches between the target RNA and the primers. Focusing on the QPrimer region, the four undetectable viruses have three nucleotide mismatches at the 3\u2032\u2010end of the Set 1 QPrimer and one nucleotide mismatch at the 3\u2032\u2010region of the Set 2 QPrimer. Meanwhile, from the assay results showing a detection rate of 90% for the tested RVs with high sensitivity and specificity (Tables 2 and 3), the assays were considered to be useful as molecular detection tools for RV infections.",

Unfortunately, only three RV\u2010B\u2010positive clinical specimens were available and the assays failed to detect all of them. The Cp values of the real\u2010time PCR assays for these three clinical specimens were greater than 30 (data not shown), so it was speculated that the low concentrations of the viral genomes resulted in their nondetection. Considering that the inability of the assays to detect RV\u2010Bs is a limitation of this approach, further evaluation using additional RV\u2010B\u2010positive clinical specimens and improvement of the assays are required. Recently, several molecular epidemiological studies have been conducted to type RVs, and it was shown that the majority of circulating RV species were RV\u2010A and \u2010C, and even the prevalence of each RV species differed in each report.34, 35, 36 Considering these epidemiological studies and the sensitivity of the developed assays in the present study, it is suggested that the assays can detect 70% to 80% of recently circulating RVs.",
