Several methods with comparable performance had been developed and successfully applied to sequencing of exomes, transcriptomes, cancer genes, significant pathogens, etc. [2\u20138]. Utilizing TruSeq RNA Access protocol and a large panel of oligos for whole-genome capture of 34 human respiratory viral pathogens (TruSeq RVP) enables enriching sequences of respiratory DNA and RNA viruses out of complex clinical specimens and production of genome sequences for genotyping and genetic variant analysis. The process includes collection, transportation, and storage of respiratory specimens, extraction of DNA and RNA, preparation of TruSeq fragment library, RVP enrichment, NGS and sequence data analysis (Fig. 1). The laboratory procedures require approximately 5 days from specimens to NGS run excluding specimen acquisition, NGS instrument run time and post-run data processing and analyses.\n",

The large capture panel and the scheme of genome-wide capture allow detection of most known respiratory viruses and viruses with high sequence divergences. The method is robust in handling specimens with viruses of a wide range of concentrations as well as specimens of compromised quality, e.g., degraded nucleic acids or high non-viral contents. The high capture efficiency and the superior sensitivity from this method make it a powerful tool for discovery of respiratory virome. However, there is an elevated risk of false positivity which demands more stringent contamination control procedure for the investigation of clinical specimens (see\nNote\n1).",

            "text": "\nThe method we described in this chapter is for research use only. It is not validated for clinical diagnosis purpose. The potential contamination and cross-contamination can come from specimen collection, shipping and handling, storage, laboratory surfaces and instruments, reagents, viral cultures, nucleic acids or PCR amplification products, etc. Conduct the experiments in a clean laboratory room where high titer cultures, high concentration nucleic acids and PCR amplifications are not present. Clean frequently used instruments and devices, e.g., centrifuge, thermocycler, mixer, pipettors, on a regular basis to prevent accumulative contaminations and before each experiment to minimize carry-over of nucleic acids from the previous run. Use newly opened consumable materials and freshly prepared reagents. We highly recommend dividing original specimens, DNA/RNA extracts, and stock solutions into small aliquots or fractions to avoid accumulative contamination and for independent repeating of the test when trouble-shooting or verification of results is needed.Respiratory swabs can be stored in transport medium such as Copan Universal Transport Medium (UTM) (Murrieta, CA, USA) or PrimeStore Molecular Transport Medium (MTM) (Longhorn Vaccines and Diagnostics LLC, Bethesda, MD, USA). We use QIAGEN QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit in DNA/RNA preparation. Carrier RNA is used in DNA/RNA extraction with QIAamp Viral RNA kit to increase RNA yield and protect purified RNA from degradation. Store RNA extracts in small aliquots and minimize freeze thaw cycles. Use RNase-decontamination products, for example, RNase AWAY made by Molecular Bio-Products, Inc., to clean the surface of the hood, benches, instruments, etc. When handle RNA samples, always wear gloves and change them often. During the procedure, work quickly and keep tubes closed and plates covered.Most reagents used in this method are parts in Illumina TruSeq RNA Access Library Prep Kit. The user\u2019s guide that we used with modification is RS-301-9001DOC Part# 15049525 Rev. B. The plate names in the protocol are DFP (Depleted RNA Fragmentation Plate), ALP (Adaptor Ligation Plate), CAP (Clean up ALP Plate), RAH1 (RNA Access Hybridization 1), RAW1 (RNA Access Wash 1), RAH2 (RNA Access Hybridization 2), RAW2 (RNA Access Wash 2), RAC1 (RNA Access Clean-up 1), RAA (RNA Access Amplification), TSP1 (Target Sample Plate 1) and RAL (RNA Access Library).SuperScript II Reverse Transcriptase and the new SuperScript IV Reverse Transcriptase can also be used. SuperScript III Reverse Transcriptase is the most often used reverse transcriptase. It is advised that SuperScript IV can obtain good yield and length of cDNA synthesis with improvements on thermal stability, speed, and resistance to inhibitors.The TruSeq RNA Access library has size range around 300 bp. Both Illumina MiSeq Reagent kits v2 and v3, which can read 150 bp and 300 bp from either end, can be used in sequencing the libraries.The TruSeq RNA Access Library guide recommends using 10\u2212100 ng of RNA as starting materials. Since total nucleic acids extracted from respiratory specimens contain both DNA and RNA and have highly variable concentrations from specimen to specimen, we use 8.5 \u03bcL of DNA/RNA for each sample in RNA fragmentation.Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer can analyze up to 12 samples in one run. An alternative high-throughput system, the Agilent TapeStation 4200, can analyze up to 96 samples in one run.The total hybridization time is about 2 h. Over hybridization may cause a high degree of nonspecific binding.Instead of using microcentrifuge tubes and a magnetic beads separation rack, a 0.8 mL 96 deep well plate and a magnetic beads separation stand for 96-well plate can be used to process a large number of samples.After two rounds of hybridization and capture and the second PCR amplification, the post-enrichment library appears having broadened size distribution with the peak shifted slightly to a higher molecular weight as compared with the fragment library shown in Fig. 2.We always include Illumina PhiX Control v3 library in MiSeq runs. The PhiX control can be used for quick assessment of data quality and for technical trouble shooting. Besides, the addition of PhiX library can improve base calling quality for libraries with high G/C or A/T contents or low diversity sequences. The spiking ratio can be increased or reduced based on the needs and the nature of the specimens.Using this method, partial to near-complete viral genome sequences can be obtained to allow genotyping and recombination and variant analysis. The method can detect both RNA and DNA viruses. During interpretation of the results, take cautious consideration of probable contamination and cross-contamination. If necessary, verify the results with additional tests such as molecular assays and/or by repeating the experiment with archived specimens or DNA/RNA aliquots.\n",
