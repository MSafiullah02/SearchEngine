The representation of causal relations can be concluded into four forms: explicit causal relation whose sentence contains explicit causal connective such as \u201clead to\u201d, implicit causal relation whose sentence does not contain causal connective, intra-sentence causal relation whose cause-effect are distributed in short text between two adjacent punctuations, and inter-sentence causal relation whose cause-effect is broken by punctuations. Examples of the four forms are shown in Table 1. Automatic extraction of causality from texts plays an important role in natural language processing application, such as providing event basis for question answer system [19].\n",

More specifically, rule-based methods heavily depend on manually designed language patterns, such as lexical-syntactic patterns [11]. Recently, deep learning methods are widely used in NLP tasks including causality extraction. Some researchers [3] focused on finding language expression of causality and extracting causal triplets from explicit causality sentences. In Table 1, for sentence like the first line, phrase \u201clead to\u201d indicate the causality blocked by adjacent punctuation explicitly. For sentence like the second line, explicit cause and effect distribute in two adjacent blocks. For sentence like the third line, the cause \u201cReduced food production\u201d and the effect \u201cfalling prices of gold and silver\u201d are hidden implicitly. As being distributed in nonadjacent sentient blocks or lacking of causality indicators, mining inter-sentence or implicit causality is harder when compared with that of intra-sentence and explicit causality. Regardless of implicit causality in nonadjacent sentence blocks like the last line.",

In the proposed model, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) with self-attention mechanism, and CRF layer are employed to capture semantic relevant characteristics. The output of CNN and self-attention are concatenated as high-level phrase representations, which improves the performance of inter-sentence or implicit causality extraction. The output of CRF layer is the label of each word in inter-sentence or implicit causal relation sentences. In the experiment, we created three annotation datasets on a wide range of public data, which will be released to facilitate ongoing research. The results shown that our model achieved stat-of-the-art performs by improving the F1-scores of causal extraction up to 82.27% and F1-scores of effect extraction up to 75.34% on the created datasets.",
