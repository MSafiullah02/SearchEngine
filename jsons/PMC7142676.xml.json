He underwent CT simulation and started the treatment of five daily fractions. On March 5th 2020 a woman with brain metastasis underwent CT simulation for whole brain and another patient with bone metastasis started treatment. During the second session of radiotherapy the patient with brain metastases had vomiting in the treatment room and treatment was stopped. Three technologists and one physician did not used personal protective equipment (PPE) at that time when they went into contact with her. On March 13th 2020 the head of ROd was informed that the aforementioned patients resulted COVID-19 positive. Two of them died some days after. The four professionals were put in quarantine and COVID-19 test was required. On March 16th, 2020, PPE were provided and constituted by surgical mask, FFP2 (Filtering Face Piece) mask to be used during contact with patients, disposable gowns and gloves. FFP1 masks filter nontoxic powder with an admitted leakage of 15%, FFP2 ones filter powder fumes and aerosols damaging the human health with maximum leakage of 11%, and FFP3 as the FFP2 but they also filter viruses and bacteria with a maximum leakage of 5%.",

In case of other type of contacts with positive patients, the HCW is required to keep working and to self-monitor her health status (temperature monitoring). It is likely that this policy was determined by regional shortage of tests and personnel. In this department the positive nurse was put in quarantine and the remaining HWC were treated as cases with non-strict contact because of the use of surgical masks.",
