Western immunoblot of whole-cell lysates showed that HGF treatment suppressed TNF-\u03b1 induced total E-selectin expression in a time-dependent manner. E-selectin is found both on the cell membrane and in the intracellular reservoir in activated endothelial cells.24 Only membrane E-selectin is accessible to leukocytes and functionally active in mediating the endothelial\u2013leukocyte adhesion. To examine whether HGF treatment modulated cell surface expression of E-selectin, flow cytometry (Figure 1b) and fluorescent immunocytochemistry (Figure 1c\u2013f) without cell membrane permeabilization were employed. As shown in Figure 1c\u2013f, control and HGF alone treated HUVEC cells are negative for E-selectin. TNF-\u03b1 markedly induced E-selectin expression with a typical surface distribution pattern, and HGF pretreatment significantly decreased the surface E-selectin staining. Flow cytometry analysis corroborated the immunocytochemistry findings. HGF prevented TNF-\u03b1 induced surface expression of E-selectin in HUVEC cells.",

TNF-\u03b1 promoted monocyte adhesion (Figure 2c), and HGF strikingly prevented it (Figure 2d). To quantify monocytes adherent to HUVEC monolayers, cells were lysed and subjected to fluorometric analysis (Figure 2f), which was in agreement with the microscopic findings. Of note, addition of a specific rabbit anti-E-selectin antibody blocked monocyte adhesion, suggesting that E-selectin mediates endothelial to monocyte adhesion and that suppression of endothelial expression of E-selectin by HGF accounts for the reduction in monocytic adhesion.",

To determine which signaling pathway mediates HGF suppression of E-selectin, we pretreated HUVEC with various inhibitors specific for each pathway. As shown in Figure 3b, the suppressive effect of HGF on TNF-\u03b1 -induced E-selectin was blocked by two different inhibitors specific for the PI3K\u2013Akt pathway, wortmannin and LY294002. In contrast, U0126, the selective inhibitor for the Ras\u2013Mek\u2013Erk pathway and PpYLKTK-mts, the Stat3 inhibitor, failed to abolish the HGF's inhibitory action (Figure 3c).

In HUVEC cells, HGF treatment immediately elicited inhibitory phosphorylation of GSK3\u03b2 and, to a lesser extent, GSK3\u03b1 (Figure 4a\n). This effect persisted for at least 90 min in the presence or absence of TNF-\u03b1, while TNF-\u03b1 alone had only a minor effect.

Vectors encoding the hemagglutin (HA) tagged wild type (WT) GSK3\u03b2 or uninhibitable mutant GSK3\u03b2,30 in which the regulatory serine-9 residue was replaced by alanine (S9A-GSK3\u03b2), were transfected into HUVEC cells. As a control, pcDNA3 was used in transfection. To evaluate the levels of expression, whole-cell lysates were analyzed by immunoblotting for HA or HA-GSK3\u03b2 (Figure 7a\n). Immunofluorescent detection using an antibody against the HA epitope revealed that over 50% of the cells expressed the HA-tagged constructs 24 h after transfection. As shown in Figure 7a\u2013c, HGF inhibition of TNF-\u03b1 induced E-selectin expression was evident in HUVEC cells transfected with pcDNA3 or WT-GSK3\u03b2. In contrast, ectopic expression of S9A-GSK3\u03b2 abolished the suppressive action of HGF on E-selectin expression.

Leukocyte to endothelium adhesion mediated by the selectin family of adhesion molecules, in particular E-selectin, is an indispensable event initiating the inflammatory reaction.6., 7., 8., 9., 10. In the present study, we found that HGF suppresses monocyte to endothelial adhesion and attenuates acute renal inflammation via inhibition of endothelial E-selectin expression. HGF exerts this action via activation of PI3K\u2013Akt\u2013GSK3\u03b2 pathway in endothelial cells. This finding complements our recent report demonstrating that HGF attenuates renal inflammation in the rat remnant kidney model of chronic renal disease.23 HGF has also recently been reported to be anti-inflammatory in non-renal diseases.21., 31., 32., 33., 34. In a murine model of inflammatory bowl disease (IBD), HGF gene transfection diminished inflammatory infiltrates in the intestinal epithelium.31 Similarly, Arthur et al.\n32., 33. reported that direct intravenous infusion of exogenous HGF to rats with IBD significantly ameliorated gross and microscopic bowl inflammation. In a murine model of airway hyperresponsiveness, airway inflammation was reduced by administration of recombinant HGF.34 In the present study, exogenous HGF significantly attenuated TNF-\u03b1 induced macrophage infiltration and acute renal inflammation in rats. The finding that HGF has systemic anti-inflammatory effects suggests that HGF may intercept common processes in the general inflammatory reaction rather than organ-specific mechanisms.",

Increased expression of particular adhesion molecules is an important early marker of endothelial activation. E-selectin is of particular interest because it is only found on the inflamed endothelium in contrast to other adhesion molecules, which have a wide constitutive tissue distribution.9 Previous studies demonstrated that inhibition of endothelial activation by glucocorticoids35 or statins36 attenuates inflammation by decreasing endothelial expression of adhesion molecules, including E-selectin. Similarly, blocking the interaction between the endothelium and leukocytes with E-selectin antibodies as well as selectin antagonists also ameliorates various inflammatory diseases.11., 12., 13., 14., 15., 16. For instance, anti-E-selectin blocking antibody or E-selectin gene disruption protected mice from ischemia\u2013reperfusion induced acute renal failure.12 Similarly, antibody blockade of E-selectin decreased adventitial inflammation and attenuated intimal hyperplasia in rat carotid arteries after balloon injury.13 Moreover, transgenic mice producing soluble E-selectin that can competitively inhibit the binding of inflammatory cells to E-selectins on the endothelium are resistant to bleomycin induced chronic pulmonary inflammation and lung fibrosis.14 All these studies suggest the therapeutic potential of E-selectin blockade in inflammatory diseases. In our study, HGF was found to suppress endothelial E-selectin expression in cultured HUVEC cells and in vivo in rats injected with TNF-\u03b1. Suppression of E-selectin in turn was responsible, at least in part, for HGF-induced suppression of monocyte to endothelial adhesion and inflammation in the kidney.",

The PI3K\u2013Akt pathway is a major signaling cascade triggered by the binding of HGF to its cognate receptor c-Met on endothelial cells.17., 18., 19. In the present study, HGF activated PI3K\u2013Akt in endothelial cells and specific blockade of PI3K\u2013Akt overrode HGF suppression of E-selectin expression. These data are consistent with another study in a murine model of endotoxemia,37 in which blocking the PI3K\u2013Akt pathway with wortmannin or LY294002 enhanced LPS-induced E-selectin levels and exacerbated macrophage infiltration in liver and kidney. GSK3 is an important downstream substrate of the PI3K\u2013Akt signaling pathway that has been shown to regulate the inflammatory response.29., 38. A ubiquitously expressed serine-threonine kinase, GSK3 exists in two isoforms, GSK3\u03b1 and GSK3\u03b2 and is a unique signal transducer in that it is constitutively active under normal conditions. GSK3 is inactivated in response to PI3K signaling, as a result of Akt-mediated inhibitory phosphorylation.39., 40. We found that HGF induced inhibitory phosphorylation of both GSK3\u03b1 and GSK3\u03b2 in endothelial cells. Selective inhibition of GSK3 by lithium also inhibited phosphorylation of GSK3 and suppressed TNF-\u03b1-induced E-selectin expression in HUVEC cells, reminiscent of the action of HGF. Furthermore, ectopic expression of a mutant construct encoding the uninhibitable GSK3\u03b2 blunted HGF-induced suppression of E-selectin, again suggesting that HGF inhibits E-selectin via inhibition of GSK3\u03b2. A regulatory role for GSK3\u03b2 in E-selectin gene expression was also reported by Hoeflich et al.\n29 In that study, E-selectin-luciferase transcription induced by TNF-\u03b1 or IL-1\u03b2 was reduced in GSK3\u03b2\n-/- cells and could be restored by the expression of exogenous GSK-3.",

Recent data suggest that GSK3\u03b2 is an essential element for NF-\u03baB activation.41., 42., 43. Sequence analysis reveals the presence of multiple putative \u03baB elements in the promoter region of the E-selectin gene.44 In addition, interaction between NF-\u03baB and \u03baB elements in the E-selectin promoter is required for E-selectin expression.44., 45. Therefore, it is possible that HGF inhibition of endothelial E-selectin and inflammation might be due to suppression of NF-\u03baB via GSK3\u03b2 inactivation. GSK3\u03b2 has been recently suggested to be a key regulator of multiple cellular processes implicated in the pathogenesis of diabetes and chronic inflammatory diseases.26., 38. Due to its regulatory effect on GSK3\u03b2, HGF might represent a novel potential strategy for the treatment of inflammatory diseases.",
