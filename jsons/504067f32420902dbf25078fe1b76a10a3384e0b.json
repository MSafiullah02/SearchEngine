Beta-hemolytic group A streptococci are mainly extracellular bacteria, but by specifically binding fibronectin, a protein that exists in human blood plasma and in the extracellular matrix, beta-hemolytic group A streptococci may be efficiently internalized into human mucosal cells. The fibronectin bound to the bacterial surface thereby acts like a bridging molecule with host cell integrins, which in turn initiate the uptake process that leads to internalization (45) . Sela & Barzilai (76) found that beta-hemolytic group A streptococcal strains were able to survive for 4-7 days inside cultured epithelial cells. They also found that beta-hemolytic group A streptococcal strains from patients with treatment failure harboured an internalization-associated gene in higher prevalence than strains recovered from patients in whom the streptococcal strains had been successfully eradicated. It is not known if internalization into host cells can influence the severity of beta-hemolytic group A streptococcal infections. Strains of streptococci show varying capacity to internalize (47, 94) , and internalized beta-hemolytic group A streptococci have been found in asymptomatic carriers as well as in patients with pharyngotonsillitis (95) . Strains from patients with treatment failure exhibit a significantly increased ability to survive intracellularly in cultured epithelial cells compared with strains from successfully treated patients (53) . On the other hand, a betahemolytic group A streptococcal strain that was able to internalize in an animal model was less able to cause serious disease than beta-hemolytic group A streptococci without the internalizing capacity (59) .",

Impetigo, pharyngotonsillitis and erysipelas may be comparatively mild and are effectively treated with antibiotics. However, since the late 1980s, a rising number of life-threatening invasive betahemolytic group A streptococcal infections have been encountered, such as necrotizing fasciitis and streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (12, 36) . Streptococci in these diseases are often restricted to certain M-types, in particular M1, and produce powerful superantigens, such as the pyrogenic exotoxin A, SpeA. Surgical intervention is often needed in the case of necrotizing fasciitis. However, in spite of antibiotics and intensive care, the mortality is high for patients with necrotizing fasciitis or streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (14, 19) . Acute rheumatic fever, the most serious nonsuppurative complication of beta-hemolytic group A streptococcal pharyngotonsillitis, is the leading cause of acquired heart disease among children in developing countries (5) . Although no longer a significant health problem in most socioeconomically advanced countries, limited outbreaks of acute rheumatic fever occurred in the USA in the 1980s (88) .",

Concurrent symptoms from the respiratory tract (e.g. cough or rhinorrhea) indicate a viral origin of the disease. Established beta-hemolytic group A streptococcal throat and skin infections in close surroundings of the patient such as at home, or in school or daycare centres, increases the probability of a betahemolytic group A streptococcal origin of the infection. Certain symptoms are more pronounced in pharyngotonsillitis of a beta-hemolytic group A streptococcal origin than in pharyngotonsillitis of another etiology. Thus, a high degree of redness in the throat (71), fever (30) and a shorter duration of symptoms before seeking medical care (79) correlate significantly with a beta-hemolytic group A streptococci etiology. The so-called Centor criteria have been widely used to implicate beta-hemolytic group A streptococci in adult patients and these are as follows: tonsillar exudates, tender anterior cervical adenopathy, fever by history and absence of cough. If three of these criteria are met, the positive predictive value for a beta-hemolytic group A streptococcal infection is 40-60% (11) . The findings are, however, inconsistent and although the clinical picture may be of some guidance, it is seldom sufficient for establishing a reliable etiological diagnosis.",

A good view of the pharynx and obtaining proper sampling technique are essential to achieve a representative sample. The specimen should be obtained from the tonsillar surface because beta-hemolytic group A streptococci in pharyngotonsillitis are predominantly localized on the tonsils and on the posterior oropharyngeal wall (48) . The rapid antigen test requires more bacteria than required for culture.

            "text": "An asymptomatic carriage stage of beta-hemolytic group A streptococci is reported to occur in about 10% of adults and 25% of children during the winter season, although the estimates vary considerably (71) . During large outbreaks of beta-hemolytic group A streptococcal pharyngotonsillitis, the carrier rate can be as high as 60% (21) . A 4-year longitudinal study of 5-15-year-old schoolchildren found that the period during which a child carried beta-hemolytic group A streptococci of the same emm type averaged 10.8 weeks (range: 3-34 weeks). Many children, however, experienced several periods of carriage during the study and frequently exhibited switches in emm type (54) . The risk of becoming a carrier of beta-hemolytic group A streptococci, as well as of contracting pharyngotonsillitis, is related to the period of time spent in close contact with a patient during the week preceding the onset of illness (18, 89) . The reason why some individuals become carriers is unknown, but the carrier state appears to be a relatively harmless condition because it probably does not result in a clinical infection (39) and the streptococci are present in low numbers (71) , which probably does not support a person-to-person transmission of the organism (21) . However, problems arise if a carrier of beta-hemolytic group A streptococci acquires viral pharyngitis, because a positive test for beta-hemolytic group A streptococci raises the issue of antibiotic treatment. This example highlights the importance of a careful evaluation of symptoms in order to avoid unnecessary antibiotic treatment.",

However, beta-hemolytic group A streptococci are amongst the most virulent human pathogens, and patients with pharyngotonsillitis caused by infection with this bacterium can be seriously affected with high fever, dysphagia and severe pain. Although a majority of patients become free of symptoms within a week, irrespective of therapy, antibiotic treatment of pharyngotonsillitis caused by beta-hemolytic group A streptococci can significantly shorten the duration of symptoms (13, 16) . Antibiotic treatment may also, to some extent, reduce the risk of purulent complications, such as peritonsillitis, otitis and sinusitis (13, 15, 93) . In acute rheumatic fever, it is claimed that a majority of the patients have a history of pharyngotonsillitis. The decline of acute rheumatic fever in the developed world may indeed be the result of routine antibiotic use for beta-hemolytic group A streptococcal pharyngotonsillitis, supporting the present principles of treatment. Rheumatic fever is still a major health problem in many developing countries, and beta-hemolytic group A streptococci have been estimated to be the eighth most common source of global mortality caused by a single pathogen (10) . In necrotizing fasciitis and streptococcal toxic shock syndrome, however, the port of entry of beta-hemolytic group A streptococci is seldom reported to be pharyngotonsillitis (14, 19) .",

Patients show prominent exudate and swelling of the tonsils, cervical adenopathy, hepatomegaly and often splenomegaly. Mononucleosis patients with beta-hemolytic group A streptococcal pharyngotonsillitis show a prolonged course of pharyngotonsillitis, fever, fatigue and tender cervical adenopathy. Heterophile antibodies are not detectable until several weeks after the onset of mononucleosis, but immunoglobulin M specific antibodies against capsid and early Epstein-Barr virus antigens can be helpful for early diagnosis. Mononucleosis in most patients will resolve without special treatment. Some patients having difficulty with swallowing and breathing will need hospital care. Cytomegalovirus causes about 10% of mononucleosis cases, and hepatitis is more evident than with Epstein-Barr virus-related disease.

Viruses account for more than half of the cases of pharyngotonsillitis. Beta-hemolytic group A streptococci are the etiological agents in 15-30% of cases, with higher figures observed during the winter months. Beta-hemolytic group A streptococci are virulent human pathogens, which may cause suppurative and nonsuppurative complications, and sometimes life-threatening diseases such as necrotizing fasciitis and streptococcal toxic shock syndrome. Signs and symptoms of a beta-hemolytic group A streptococcal infection include tonsillar exudate, tender anterior cervical adenopathy, a history of fever and absence of a cough, but the findings are rather inconsistent. Identification of the bacterium by culture or by a rapid antigen test is needed to establish a definite diagnosis. Penicillin V for 10 days is the drug of choice in primary beta-hemolytic group A streptococcal pharyngotonsillitis. Although penicillin resistance is not recorded in beta-hemolytic group A streptococci, penicillin V treatment fails in as many as 5-25% of the patients, and higher failure rates can occur after a second course of penicillin V treatment, sometimes necessitating tonsillectomy. Factors potentially contributing to antibiotic treatment failure include low compliance rate, reinfection from the environment, eradication of alfahemolytic streptococci with an inhibitory effect on beta-hemolytic group A streptococci, an increase in beta-lactamase-producing bacteria inactivating the drug, penicillin-tolerant streptococci, low antibiotic concentration at the site of infection, and intracellular beta-hemolytic group A streptococci surviving therapy. Treatment with cephalosporins or clindamycin has been reported to result in a less frequent recurrence of beta-hemolytic group A streptococcal pharyngotonsillitis and is advocated in patients with beta-hemolytic group A streptococcus pharyngotonsillitis not responding to penicillin V treatment.",
