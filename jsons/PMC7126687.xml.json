The single stranded, positive sense RNA genome of HEV comprises three open reading frames (ORFs). ORF1 encodes nonstructural proteins including methyltransferase, protease, helicase, and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. ORF2 encodes the capsid protein, which enables virus cell entry and contains the targets for neutralizing antibodies. ORF3 encodes a phosphorylated protein that is important for virus release.1\n",

However, progression to severe fulminant liver failure may occur in certain high-risk groups, such as pregnant women and elderly patients with underlying liver disease. Although there is only one serotype, four major HEV genotypes capable of infecting humans are currently recognized. HEV genotypes 1 and 2 are only found in humans and account for most of the hepatitis E in the developing world where transmission occurs by the fecal-oral route via contaminated waterways. HEV genotypes 3 and 4 are found in swine and other animals across the world, sporadically infecting humans in industrialized countries via foodborne routes. Human-to-human spread in developed countries is limited to blood-borne transmission via blood products derived from viremic donors. In addition to these genotypes of clinical importance, several novel HEV-like viruses have been discovered in a variety of animal specimens, similar to each other in overall genomic organization but differing in terms of the total genome length and position of ORF3 with respect to the ORF1/2 junction.4\n",

HEV3 was first isolated from swine specimens in the United States in 1997, when it was also discovered that large proportions of herds across the North American Midwest were seropositive against HEV, a finding echoed by studies on swine populations across the world.5, 6 Another genotype of clinical importance, HEV4, was identified from pigs in Taiwan.7 This genotype has subsequently been found to be enzootic in China and Japan; it has also recently been reported in swine populations and autochthonous human infections in Europe.8, 9, 10, 11 HEV infection generally affects young pigs and is subclinical. Given the high fecal viral loads and prolonged periods of virus shedding in stool, transmission between pigs is likely to be fecal-oral.12\n",

Increased HEV seroprevalence in swine handlers compared to the general public provides indirect evidence for subclinical infection due to contact with infected animals.39, 40 Nonhuman primates have been successfully infected by both HEV genotypes 3 and 4 in experimental settings, proving the feasibility of zoonotic infection.3, 41 Epidemiological studies from outbreaks and case series show that a history of consumption of uncooked deer, wild boar meat, and shellfish is a risk factor for acquiring hepatitis E.42, 43, 44 The foodborne zoonotic source hypothesis is further supported by the high sequence similarity of HEV gene sequences from patients with autochthonous hepatitis E and animal sources in the same region.45, 46 HEV3 and HEV4 RNA are frequently detected in meat products originating from pigs and feral animals that are sold for human consumption.45, 46, 47, 48, 49 In a local study in Hong Kong, 31% of pig liver samples were positive for HEV RNA and the sequences were identical to human cases in the region, highlighting the risk of acquiring hepatitis E from consumption of foods such as pig liver congee, which is a common delicacy in the region.50 Homogenates of such contaminated meat have been successfully used to infect pigs, demonstrating that the HEV RNA forms a part of the fully viable infectious particles.49 Deserving special mention is the recent detection of HEV3 RNA from shellfish, which may be an emerging, indirect vehicle for zoonotic transmission and highlights the health risks of consuming undercooked bivalves that filter feed in waterbeds supplied by runoff contaminated with swine excreta or viscera.51 Due to rapid industrialization and improvement in sanitary conditions in many parts of East Asia, zoonotic HEV transmission is assuming an increasing importance with a resultant genotype switch from HEV1 to HEV3 or HEV4.8 In other developing countries in Asia, although HEV genotypes are frequently detected in pigs and other animals, most human disease still occurs by person\u2013person spread of HEV1.52 However, even in such settings, zoonotic transmission may account for some hepatitis E cases.53 Although rat, rabbit, and mongoose populations are known to harbor HEV strains that are closely related to human pathogenic HEV strains, their role in causing zoonotic human hepatitis E is unclear at this stage.16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22 The potential of rats to harbor infectious HEV is a particular concern due to their close proximity to urban human dwellings. As for the possible role of dromedary camel HEV, although a study has shown that HEV is the commonest cause of acute hepatitis in Dubai,54 no sequence information from the HEV strains involved is available. Further genomic studies on HEV from Dubai patients should reveal the importance of dromedaries as the possible source of HEV in the Middle East.",

Besides expediting diagnosis, such epidemiological clues could also enable treatment of certain groups of patients at risk of chronic hepatitis E infection (see below) and facilitate outbreak investigation. Although most zoonotic HEV cases are sporadic, point source foodborne HEV outbreaks are well documented.44 Acquisition of HEV through the use of porcine derived medical products such as heparin, insulin, or coagulation factors has never been convincingly demonstrated, but remains a theoretical possibility given the ubiquity of HEV in swine populations.55\n",

Vaccination is an attractive alternative, but its cost-effectiveness for population-wide usage remains to be evaluated. HEV control at the level of animal husbandry remains to be assessed; measures such as housing swine in barrier conditions and regular screening of HEV RNA have been proposed for herds raised to provide xenotransplants and other medical products.58 However, such methods are likely to be inhumane and commercially impractical for swine raised for the food industry.

Controlled trials are required to define the role of ribavirin in the treatment of patients with acute hepatitis E. Ribavirin prophylaxis has been described for postexposure prophylaxis of some viral hemorrhagic fever viruses.90 This raises the intriguing possibility of ribavirin for postexposure prophylaxis in sequestered outbreak settings, such as refugee camps and military encampments, to suppress initial viral replication. However, ribavirin is strictly contraindicated in pregnant women, limiting its use in an important high-risk group. Therefore, hepatitis E vaccination still remains the most important prospect for disease prevention in such settings (see below).",

            "text": "HEV 239 (Hecolin), a recombinant bacterially expressed polypeptide vaccine based on a 26 kDa segment of HEV genotype 1 ORF2, was licensed in China in 2011. The polypeptide takes the form of a virus-like particle with surface presentation of immunodominant epitopes for optimal immunogenicity.91, 92, 93 In a Phase III clinical trial involving 112,604 participants from 11 townships in China, healthy adults were randomized to receive either three doses of HEV 239 (at 0 months, 1 month, and 6 months) or placebo (hepatitis B vaccine).94 They were followed up for 13 months after receiving the third dose. No participants in the HEV 239 vaccine arm, who had received at least two doses, developed clinical hepatitis E during the follow up period. Vaccine efficacy at 19 months after one dose of HEV 239 was estimated to be 95.5% (95% Confidence Interval 66.3\u201399.4). In a subsequent analysis on the vaccinated population, protection extends to 2 years after vaccination and is independent of hepatitis B carrier status.95, 96 The vaccine was well tolerated and also appears to be safe in pregnancy on preliminary analysis.97 Interestingly, the majority of patients in the placebo group who developed clinical hepatitis E had genotype 4 HEV RNA on sequencing. This supports previous animal studies that found this genotype 1 based vaccine to be highly cross protective against HEV4, a zoonotic genotype. This is a significant finding that encourages trial of the vaccine in areas with HEV3 predominance. While the vaccine appears highly promising, questions remain about the duration of protection, efficacy in outbreak settings, immunogenicity in young children, immunogenicity against HEV3, and efficacy in immunocompromised patients. A Phase IV trial, currently in progress, involving individuals above the age of 65 years, will address the effectiveness of the vaccine in elderly recipients, a group at risk for severe zoonotic HEV infection.98 The HEV 239 vaccine has also been shown to be highly immunogenic in rabbits, conferring protection against both HEV4 and rabbit HEV.99 If vaccination is found to be effective in blocking transmission in swine populations, animal vaccination may be an effective intervention to reduce zoonotic hepatitis E in developed countries.",

While improvement of sanitation facilities is the clear (if difficult to achieve) solution for hepatitis E control in resource-poor settings, the roadmap for autochthonous foodborne disease control in developed countries is less clear. Effective HEV control in meat production chains will take a major industry initiative, but may be the only way forward for sustained control of autochthonous hepatitis E. The need to screen blood products for HEV RNA is currently under debate and is generating considerable public interest. Further refinement of treatment paradigms of acute and chronic hepatitis E is required. The genetic basis for reduced viral ribavirin susceptibility should be defined for patients who fail ribavirin therapy. Alternatives such as favipiravir should be explored in case of ribavirin treatment failure in chronic hepatitis E patients. Finally, political will and resource mobilization is required to export the effective and safe vaccine to areas where it is most required. Ongoing characterization of novel animal HEV genotypes is important due to the possibility of such viruses undertaking a species jump to cause human infections in the future.",
