            "text": "In 2007, the fever, thrombocytopenia and leukopenia syndrome (FTLS; also called severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome, SFTS) was first reported in Henan province, China [1], [2]. Since then, this life-threatening disease has been reported in many Chinese provinces, including Hubei, Anhui, Jiangsu, Liaoning and Shandong. The main clinical symptoms are sudden onset of fever (>37.5\u00b0C), fatigue, marked anorexia, headache, myalgia, arthralgia, dizziness, lymphadenopathy, vomiting, and diarrhea. Laboratory tests show thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, increased urine protein, and elevated serum aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase. Initially, this disease was diagnosed as suspended human granulocytic anaplasmosis (HGA) infection [3]. However, only 8% of patients were positive for HGA infection, indicating that other pathogens likely contribute to this syndrome. Samples collected in 2009 identified a novel virus in the Bunyaviridae family, genus Phlebovirus in FTLS cases; the virus has been named several times including severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus (SFSTV), Henan fever virus (HFV), fever, thrombocytopenia and leukopenia syndrome virus (FTLSV), and Huaiyangshan virus (HYSV) [1], [2], [4]. Serosurveillance has shown that 1 to3.8% of examined populations in hilly areas had FTLSV antibodies, suggesting that SFTSV has circulated widely in China but only a small proportion of infected individuals develop disease. The overall mortality of FTLSV infection in China is about 7.3% (2391 cases and 174 deaths),but ranges from 6.3% to 30% in various studies [5].",

The L segment contains 6391 nucleotides encoding an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase; the M segment contains 3366 nucleotides encoding glycoproteins Gn and Gc; and the S segment contains 1760 nucleotides of antisense RNA encoding a nonstructural protein (NS) and a nucleocapsid protein (N) in opposite orientations. Partial sequencing of L and S segments from human cases and ticks confirmed that FTLSV is a novel Phlebovirus and is most closely related to the non-pathogenic Uukuniemi virus (the pairwise nucleotide similarities for the L, M and S segments are 34%, 24% and 29%, respectively) [4]. All FTLSV sequences currently available in GenBank are similar regardless of their sampling locations (>90% sequence similarity), suggesting that they descended from a relatively recent common ancestor.",

FTLSV has been detected in Haemaphysalis longicornis and Rhipicephalus microplus ticks collected from a number of domestic animals, including cattle, buffalo, goats, cats and dogs [4], [7], [8]. The potential for human-to-human transmission has also been shown [9], [10], [11], and phylogenetic analysis of partial L, M and S sequences has indicated that there are five phylogenetic groups circulating in China [4]. However, more detailed genetic information is needed to fully characterize the history of FTLSV and elucidate its transmission dynamics in China. Such studies could facilitate the future development of new strategies for controlling FTLSV.",

GTR+G was selected for all three segments. Preliminary analyses were conducted to determine which clock (strict versus relaxed) and demographic (constant versus Bayesian Skyline population size) models were most appropriate for the datasets, with runs initially consisting of 10,000,000 generations. An analysis of marginal likelihoods [25] indicated that the relaxed uncorrelated lognormal clock [26] and constant population size model were most appropriate for all three segments (log10 Bayes Factors >2 in all cases). Thus, the final Bayesian coalescent analyses used the GTR+G substitution model, a relaxed uncorrelated lognormal clock, and a constant population size. The S and L segment datasets were run for 50,000,000 generations, whereas the M segment dataset was run for 40,000,000 generations to ensure effective sample sizes (ESSs) of at least 200.

A standard discrete phylogeographic analysis using continuous-time Markov chains (CTMCs) to estimate the migration events between major geographic regions was set up [27]. This method can be used to infer the location state of the ancestral-branch geographic states, detect non-zero rates of state-transition over the whole tree, and build a reversible diffusion rate matrix between previously defined locations identified using the BSSVS applications. The results were summarized in an MCC tree, and further visualized by converting the tree into a keyhole markup language (KML) file suitable for viewing in Google Earth (http://earth.google.com). Following our discrete phylogeographic visualizations, we used SPREAD 1.04 [28] to estimate the putative spatiotemporal pattern of the spread and visualize the diffusion of the virus. The Bayes factor (BF) test, which determines statistically significant phylogeographic links, was performed using SPREAD 1.04.

The root state posterior probabilities for all locations ranged between 9.21% for Liaoning and 37.40% for Huaiyangshan.

Two main spread routes were observed (Figure 5A, Figure 5B, Figure 5C). FLTSV initially spread from the Huaiyangshan region into the surrounding provinces: eastward to Anhui and Jiangsu Provinces, and northward to Liaoning and Shandong Provinces. Thereafter, FTLSV is predicted to have spread from the Jiangsu Province to Liaoning, Shandong, and Anhui Provinces. In a further investigation of these diffusion patterns, the BF test identified three well-supported (BF>3) migration routes for FTLSV (Figure 5D): from Huaiyangshan to Jiangsu (BF = 9.74), from Jiangsu to Shandong (BF = 3.35), and from Jiangsu to Liaoning (BF = 3.17).",

At least two possible reasons for unencumbered movement of FTLSV: 1) there are no obvious physical barriers to prevent viral transmission, as the locations all correspond to plains or hilly regions of China; and 2) these regions share similar enzootic vectors and potential primate and non-primate reservoirs. Several papers have reported the isolation of FTLSV from two tick species (Haemaphysalis longicornis and Rhipicephalus microplus) and domestic animals such as sheep, goat and cattle [4], [7], [8]. Furthermore, the analysis performed in this study suggest that FTLSV strains from Japan share a common ancestor with viral genotypes circulating in China, indicating that the virus has crossed the sea between China and Japan, forming the Japanese linage.",

Genetic reassortment can profoundly affect the pathogenicity and diversity of RNA viruses [34], [35], [36], [37], [38], [39]. For example, reassortment among influenza virus strains (another RNA virus with a segmented genome) results in antigenic shift and the emergence of new pandemic strains [40]. The S segment of FTLSV encodes the N protein, which binds viral RNAs and encapsidates them in to ribonucleoprotein complexes (RNPs) as well as the NS protein, which prevents the host interferon response by interfering with the cellular mRNAs and protein synthesis machineries of host cells. Reassortment of the S segment, therefore, could influence the replication and immunogenicity of the virus. The existence of many circulating genotypes in China and the wide distribution of potential vectors may increase the opportunity for reassortment to occur in FTLSV. Surveillance for detection of viruses with enhanced pathogenicity is critical to implementing control and prevention measures reducing the impact of FTLSV infection.",

However, with advances currently being made in the development of increasingly more realistic evolutionary models, the bias imposed by the purifying selection may be solved in the foreseeable future.

Consistent with this, these results indicate that FTLSV has been circulating in China for many years. The reconstructed epidemic history of FTLSV suggests that the virus is a recently emerged pathogen that originated around the 18th century. Bayesian analysis indicated that the most recent common ancestor of the FTLSV strains existed an estimated 117 to 195 year prior to 2012. Similar estimates were obtained for the L, M and S segments, indicating that these segments have co-evolved. Lam et al. [31] reported that FTLSV originated from a common ancestor and most likely existed between 1817 and 1895, which is somewhat more recent estimate than the one proposed in this analysis. This difference might be explained in two ways. First, the evolutionary rate of Rift Valley Fever Virus (RVFV) was used as a model for the FTLSV analysis of Lam et al. Although RVFV and FTLSV both belong to the family Bunyaviridae, RVFV is mosquito-borne while FTLSV is tick-borne, and mosquito-borne RNA viruses are believed to evolve more rapidly than tick-borne viruses within the same family [43], [44]. Second, our analysis used full-length sequences of the three segments, and included many more sequences than were available in GenBank at the time of the previous study.",

Once FTLSV reached Jiangsu Province, this province became a secondary source of FTLSV spread, as the virus moved from Jiangsu Province into Liaoning Province between 1905 and 1943. In the past 50 or 60 years FTLSV has moved more rapidly, as the MCC tree shows that many strains isolated from Shandong, Liaoning and Anhui were recently introduced from Huaiyangshan and Jiangsu. Finally, the Bayesian test provided statistical support for three transmission routes: from Huaiyangshan to Jiangsu, from Jiangsu to Shandong and from Jiangsu to Liaoning.",

Movement over large distances was observed, such as that between Liaoning and Jiangsu Province and Huaiyangshan (\u223c1500 km). It is likely that an animal infected with FTLSV or carrying virus-infected ticks introduce FTLSV into Liaoning Province. The recent dramatic increases in unregulated wildlife trade, livestock import/export, and global human movement are likely to have created additional opportunities for spread of this severe disease. In addition, expanding urban populations have triggered ecosystem changes that may have promoted the emergence of FTLSV by increasing human exposure to the natural reservoir or vector.",
