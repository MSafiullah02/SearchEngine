The event, which usually lasts for about a month and a half, requires careful planning and disease-risk assessment in order to detect and control infectious disease outbreaks. Kumbh Mela gatherings have been associated with major outbreaks of cholera [15]. Telemedicine\u2014the use of electronic resources in the exchange and transmission of medical knowledge and data- was credited with aiding to avert a possible cholera epidemic at the 2001 gathering [16]. Researchers have also used novel technologies such as Apple iPads to geo-locate pilgrims visiting hospitals during Kumbh Mela [11], [12]; however, most of the public health success can be attributed to sanitation, and the sufficient availability of hospitals, doctors and medical staff. In addition, thousands of sweepers are charged with the collection of both faecal material and other rubbish estimated at 40 to 50 tons each day [13], [17]. Such sanitation practices help to limit cases of diarrhoea, Escherichia coli, cholera and other infections.",

            "text": "The Hajj, which draws about three million people to Mecca from all over the globe annually, is another major religious gathering [18], [19], [20], [21]. Muslims also gather in Mecca year-round to perform a \u2018minor\u2019 pilgrimage called Umrah. The month of Ramadan is the peak time for performing Umrah and the number of participants can be as high as during the Hajj. Given both the magnitude of these events, and the geographic diversity represented among the pilgrims, a broad range of infectious diseases can be introduced. Respiratory infections occur frequently among pilgrims returning from the Hajj [2], [18], [22]. In addition to rhinovirus, risk for contracting tuberculosis is as high as 10% [2], [23]. The vast majority of pilgrims travel from low-income countries where tuberculosis is endemic, and though they may not be symptomatic upon arrival, the disease may be reactivated by the physical stress of the pilgrimage [2]. This said, the leading cause of hospitalization during Hajj is pneumonia, which may be caused by a wide array of common infectious pathogens such as Streptococcus pneumoniae\n[24]. However, evidence suggests that the novel Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, which was first discovered in 2012, may also present clinically as pneumonia [25]. Following a large outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome in spring 2014, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has been particularly conscientious about surveillance during the 2014 Hajj season [2], [22], [24]. In addition to infectious disease surveillance, a number of novel digital technologies have emerged in recent years that can be useful for a variety of other problems that commonly arise during the Hajj, including crowd control to avoid trampling and identification of pilgrims who are lost, dead, or injured [2], [20], [23].",

A BSN is a highly specialized application of WSN in which on-body sensors monitor an individual's biometrics (e.g. heart rate, oxygen saturation, blood pressure, etc.). When combined, these two networks can be used to locate pilgrims who are ill and send ambulatory services to their coordinates if necessary. Similarly, Mitchell et al. outline a system that can track pilgrims using radio frequency identification (RFID) technology [20]. This particular solution also offers a mobile application for pilgrims with smartphones, which can be used not only to further supplement the RFID location data but also to call for an ambulance in the case of an emergency.",

Although currently in an exploratory phase, such technologies lend promise to the future of disease surveillance and detection. Additionally, rapid point-of-care diagnostic tests for both bacterial and viral infections can be useful during mass gatherings. There are several of these technologies on the market (and in development) with varying sensitivity and speed of diagnosis [56]. Accessibility of these tests to clinicians can aid in rapid diagnosis of existing and emerging infectious diseases.",
