Chronologic age is the single most important determinant for severe bronchiolitis; about two thirds of hospitalizations occur before 6 months of age.1, 2 Several reasons may account for this age distribution. Birth shortly before or soon after the onset of the RSV season results in a longer period of exposure to RSV earlier in life. Maternal antibody concentrations to RSV also show seasonal variation, and infants born early in the RSV season are more likely to be born to mothers with low neutralizing antibody concentrations.12, 13, 14\n",

Intercostal, supracostal, and subcostal retractions are evident. Initially, wheezing occurs during the expiratory phase only and is audible only through a stethoscope. As wheezing progresses, it can be heard without a stethoscope. The chest becomes hyperexpanded and hyperresonant, respirations become more labored, and retractions become more severe. Mild hypoxemia occurs in most infants with bronchiolitis. Respiratory failure can occur due to progressive hypercapnia and respiratory muscle fatigue.1\n",

Apnea can be an early manifestation of RSV infection, sometimes resulting in respiratory failure.30, 31, 32 Because the severity of bronchiolitis often waxes and wanes before consistent improvement, serial assessment of respiratory status should be performed. The ability of a young infant to breastfeed or bottle-feed without distress over time often provides a practical guide to disease severity and management. An infant who has substantial difficulty feeding as a result of respiratory distress has moderate or severe illness and usually requires hospitalization.",

These studies were challenged on the basis that control groups received water aerosols, which can produce bronchospasm in individuals with hyperreactive airways. Clinical trials with ribavirin have not demonstrated a consistent decrease in the need for mechanical ventilation, decrease in length of stay in the intensive care unit, or reduction in days of hospitalization.
