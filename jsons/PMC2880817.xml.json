For example, in the past, respiratory tract viruses were difficult to detect by using conventional methods because some do not grow well in culture. In clinical studies of acute viral illnesses, detection rates of 30% to 50% were the norm with techniques such as viral culture, antigen detection with labeled antibodies, or serologic detection. More recently, molecular techniques have greatly improved overall rates of viral detection (Table I\n), and some studies of acute respiratory tract illnesses have reported viral detection rates of as high as 90%, especially in infants. These techniques have been used to identify whole new classes of viruses, such as metapneumoviruses, bocaviruses, new strains of coronaviruses (NL63, SARS, and HKU1), and polyomaviruses. Each of these viruses can cause acute wheezing in infancy, and some have also been associated with acute exacerbations of asthma.",

It seems likely that HRV-C has been circulating for some time rather than being a newly emergent virus. Recent data in studies of children suggest that viruses in the HRV-C group might be either more prone to stimulate acute symptoms of asthma or intrinsically more virulent.5 One common feature of HRV-C and other newly identified viruses is that most are difficult or impossible to grow in standard tissue culture, which explains why they were detected first with molecular techniques.",

This is particularly true for HRV, which can be found in a considerable proportion of healthy subjects, especially in the spring and fall. Studies using sequential sampling in children indicate that detection of HRV in well children represents asymptomatic infection. Therefore it has been important to link symptomatic illnesses, particularly wheezing illnesses, with HRV detection when estimating its role in determining asthma risk.6, 7 Chronic infection with HRV does not occur except in association with marked immunosuppression.8 Identification of biomarkers that would allow us to better connect viral detection with clinically relevant outcomes is an important research goal, which would improve our ability to interpret epidemiologic data. The use of viral sequencing to track individual strains in clinical studies and the development of new techniques to track the anatomic distribution of viruses in vivo could aid the understanding of this issue.",

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most frequent infection causing bronchiolitis and pneumonia in children 1 year of age and younger and commonly presents as a wheezing illness during the late fall, winter, and early spring in temperate climates.10 Recently, Wu et al11 reported that the timing of infant birth in relationship to the peak of bronchiolitis hospitalizations for that winter season predicted the likelihood of clinically significant bronchiolitis. In addition, children who were about 121 days old at the winter virus peak also had the greatest risk of asthma. Similarly, seasonal epidemiologic analysis has been used to demonstrate that infantile wheezing illnesses during HRV seasons are important predictors of the development of persistent wheezing and asthma later in childhood.7, 12 These studies suggest the possibility that respiratory tract viral infections in early childhood contribute to asthma causality.",

Thomsen et al13 investigated the relationship between RSV infections requiring hospitalization and the development of asthma by applying genetic variance and direction of causation models to a large twin registry in Denmark. Based on this work, the authors conclude that RSV infections severe enough to result in hospitalization are an indicator of genetic predisposition, rather than a causal factor, for asthma. The apparent disparities between these informative, high-quality studies with regard to the direction of causation between severe RSV infections and asthma suggest that resolving this controversy might require prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled interventional studies, such as use of prophylactic RSV-specific mAb therapy.",

It is important to understand how host factors modify relationships between early-life viral respiratory tract infections and the development of wheezing illnesses and childhood asthma. Identifying risk factors that determine which infants and young children are most likely to wheeze with infections and the role of these infections in the genesis of asthma has been the focus of intense investigation. In this regard the relative importance of (1) lower lung volumes at birth, especially in those born prematurely; (2) the atopic status of infants; (3) the intensity of mucus secretion in response to infection; (4) neurotrophic pathways critical to airway hyperresponsiveness provoked by infection15; and (5) the ability of infants who wheeze to generate immune responses to viral pathogens, including the production of IFN-\u03b3 and type I and III interferons, remain important areas of research. Overall, it will be important to identify host genetic factors that influence the developing pulmonary and immune systems because maturational delays in host airways and antiviral responses could increase the risk of virus-induced wheeze and childhood asthma; that is, differences in the maturational level of airways and the immune system could render some infants and children more susceptible to the development of respiratory tract virus\u2013initiated, persistent airway sequelae. Alternatively, it is possible that virus-induced wheezing episodes might be a marker for subjects predisposed to asthma because of delays in airway and immune system development.",

Also, macrolides deserve more attention as possible anti-inflammatory agents targeting exacerbations. Although pharmacogenetics is expected to offer personalized solutions in the future, there are currently many attempts to characterize asthma phenotypes in a clinical sense by using, among other criteria, virus-induced exacerbations as a key component. Consequently, it is possible that interventions should be tailored to specific phenotypes. Notably, recent placebo-controlled trials suggest that neither high-dose inhaled nor oral corticosteroids are suitable for virus-induced wheezing in infancy.29, 30 It is possible that asthma controllers could be of benefit to specific subsets of infants.31, 32 Study designs evaluating individual responses to controller medications can highlight differential treatment responses.33 Among other issues, continuous versus on-demand pharmacotherapy for exacerbations should be re-evaluated for different asthma phenotypes. Recent efforts to perform comprehensive studies investigating immunologic, virologic, and physiologic measures in the lower airways of asthmatic subjects during viral infections will help to inform the development of targeted therapeutic strategies.34 Strategies aiming at reduction of respiratory tract virus exposure achievable by simple means, such as hand washing, can have a significant effect on morbidity, further suggesting the need for including focused educational programs as part of exacerbation management.",
