            "text": "Electronic data interchange (EDI) has revolutionized the way in which organizations conduct their activities. The rapid growth of electronic commerce (e-commerce) in the global scope is forcing developing countries such as China to adopt EDI to fulfill international electronic business-to-business (B2B) trades (Gibbs, Kraemer, & Dedrick, 2003). China's total amount of import and export trade reached 510 billion US dollars in 2001 (News, 2002). Accordingly, the Chinese government's attention to the development of EDI is rapidly increasing. A series of policies have promoted the development of information technology (IT) and the leaders of China envisioned that electronic commerce (e-commerce) represents the future direction of business development and will bring more opportunities to China (He, 2000). The encouragement from the government greatly impacted the attitude of industry toward IT, especially B2B e-commerce. In addition, the rapidly changing global economic environment also mandates the use of new information technologies. Upon joining the World Trade Organization (WTO) on November 10, 2001, China promised to open its telecommunications and finance markets, which coerced the development of e-commerce in China. International companies have increased their investments in China and some global companies have started to implement EDI in their subsidiaries in China.",

The B2B sector accounts for 80% of the 9.3 billion US dollar e-commerce business in China (News, 2001). The Chinese government's vision of e-commerce focuses on EDI via dedicated networks and is oriented toward wholesale procurement (Electronic Commerce, 2002). The Chinese government has undertaken various measures to promote the development of EDI, including new policies (e.g., trans-border security), significant infrastructure investment, and application promotion strategies.

The problems confronting healthcare organizations include rapid healthcare cost escalation, the inefficiency in healthcare resource allocation, and the inefficiency in healthcare provision. IT is considered as helpful in tackling these problems. China's Ministry of Health (MOH) is undertaking a major project, the China Golden Health Medical Network Project, to establish a satellite-transmitted nationwide healthcare communications network (CBnet, 1997). A part of the project is to launch the Golden Health Card, a smart card with a small embedded chip to save patient financial and medical information and to help patients obtain appropriate healthcare from hospitals in different geographic locations. Hospitals have started to use EDI to communicate with other hospitals, medical resource suppliers, insurance companies, and banks. The MOH anticipates that using EDI can significantly contribute to the containment of healthcare costs and the efficient allocation of healthcare resources.",

A descriptive study, therefore, was carried out to assess EDI usage in Chinese hospitals from four dimensions: volume, diversity, breadth, and depth. One objective of this paper is to report the study results.

Documents of the same business function but exchanged using different EDI standards also require different hardware and software components. Therefore, more diversity is associated with higher degree of computer integration (Hart & Saunders, 1998). Cox and Ghoneim (1995) argued that a firm's competitive advantage gained from a single EDI connection is unlikely to be sustainable. An increased diversity of EDI usage may be positively associated with the sustainability of a firm's competitive advantage in the market.",

Basically, the file-to-file connection needs human efforts to accomplish the electronic document exchange. The application-to-application EDI connection automates all the procedures of a business transaction. In the coupled work environment, a firm is able to directly access its partner's computer-based system. More sophisticated EDI depth means more investment, so increasing EDI depth is not necessarily a strategically wise move.",

Despite the fact that application-to-application EDI and the coupled work environment are likely to be more efficient than file-to-file EDI, they require more highly trained employees, greater network bandwidth, and more open-minded hospital policy. In China's hospitals, these requirements are not satisfied. Given this situation, measuring depth with Massetti and Zmud's three levels is not applicable in Chinese hospitals. A new perspective to examine the depth of EDI usage is necessary.",

This question classifies the depth of an EDI document into three incremental levels: (1) data, (2) data and text, and (3) data, text, and image. The three levels are based on the complexity and objective of the task for which an EDI document serves. At the first level, the task is simple and usually serves for simple hospital administration. For example, the payroll transfers between departments only require numbers and few texts. At the second level, the task is more complicated and serves for some administrative functions and most medical document exchange. For example, departmental monthly reports and patients medical records require a large amount of data and texts. At the third level, the task is mainly for medical purpose, especially telemedicine which not only requires text-based information but also multimedia information. For example, physicians performing telediagnosis for a patient with a broken spine need the patient's medical records, vital signs, symptoms, CT images, and MRI images in order to make an accurate diagnosis. Therefore, this question can differentiate EDI usage at the file-to-file level and indicate the depth of hospitals\u2019 EDI usage.",

Many Chinese researchers have tried to give EDI a precise definition, but to date there has been no consensus in this regard in China. After interviewing five IT department managers in China's hospitals, the authors found that these managers consider organizational internal data exchange as a form of EDI. These managers think that exchanging data electronically among different departments within one organization enables the organization to exchange data electronically with other organizations. Based on these interviews, the term of EDI in this study was broadly defined as the direct exchange of electronic documents among computer systems in different departments within an organization or between different organizations without human intervention.",

Second, many organizations in Beijing have excellent IT infrastructures in place. Third, Beijing is one of the 13 cities that established EDI centers of the China Public Electronic Data Interchange Business Network early in 1996. Due to these factors, the hospitals in Beijing usually receive more assistance from the government and various industry organizations to implement new technologies than hospitals in other cities. As a result, Beijing's hospitals are typically the earliest health institutions to experiment with new technologies. Therefore, choosing Beijing as the research site means that our findings might predict the future of EDI usage in hospitals in other parts of China.

Similarly, the low percentages (less than 25%) of EDI breadth denote that the hospitals have established EDI connections with only a very limited number of trading partners. This finding implies that the adoption of EDI is still in its early stage for both the hospitals and other firms. In addition, most hospitals only use EDI at the file-to-file level. At this level, 93.0% of the EDI documents do not contain image information, indicating that EDI is mostly used to support hospital administration and simple professional healthcare tasks.

Surprisingly, few differences were identified among the three hospital levels. Other than the fact that Level III hospitals have significantly greater EDI volumes in purchasing and IT and a greater EDI depth, there are no other statistically significant differences among hospital levels. The results of differences among hospital levels are interpreted with great caution because a convenience sample was used which might not represent the general population of hospitals in Beijing. For example, seven Level I hospitals were selected from a total of 230; it is very likely that this sample was biased. A plausible explanation of the lack of EDI differences between Level III hospitals and lower-level hospitals is that those Level I and Level II (especially Level I) hospitals who sent their managers for continuous education in Beijing University are likely to be the ones who put more emphasis on technology and have more resources. These Level I and Level II hospitals may tend to be champions with respect to leveraging advanced information technologies; therefore, the level of their EDI usage is shown in this study to be close to that of the Level III hospitals. Nevertheless, the major objective of this paper is to depict the EDI usage status in China's hospitals. The selection of Beijing and the inclusion of more Level III hospitals enable us to study a sample where EDI usage would more likely be great. Based on a reasonable analysis of the sample, it can be inferred from the results that in general the various aspects of EDI usage in China's hospitals will be less than the extent of EDI usage in our sample.",

First, the Chinese people's cultural assumptions and social issues might inhibit EDI usage. In China, businesses, especially in the B2B sector, operate to a large extent on the basis of personal relationships. The Chinese people build friendships with each other before undertaking any serious business initiatives. Using EDI to conduct B2B transactions can often involve unfamiliar or new trading partners, which is incongruent with the Chinese business culture. Given the great geographical expansion and heterogeneous traditions in China, people living in different regions have dissimilar beliefs. Companies that are not located close to each other are reluctant to do business with each other using manual methods because of trust concerns, let alone using EDI. This trust hurdle will not be easily overcome in a short period of time in China.",

China has no regulations to define the legitimacy of electronic patient records (EPR) and control the exchange of EPR, which has greatly impeded the electronic communication among hospitals, employers, and insurance agencies.

Shifting from traditional business to electronic business can profoundly change an organization's structure and business processes, which is perceived highly risky. Labor in China is so cheap that the start-up costs of EDI can be higher than the labor costs. As a result, the perceived benefits of EDI such as reduced costs and automated business processes may not be attractive enough to justify EDI adoption. A related issue of EDI adoption in China is the unemployment dilemma. The high unemployment rate is currently a big problem facing China (Smyth, 1999).

In the US and many European countries, the HL7 standards have become the main EDI standard for healthcare systems (Spyrou et al., 2002). IT infrastructure inadequacy is another technological obstacle for EDI adoption. Compared with other industries in China, healthcare organizations demonstrate the minimal level of leased-line connectivity (Foster & Goodman, 2000). According to United Nation, high Internet access cost, restrictions on Internet services, slow and uncertain delivery of network connections, lack of awareness of perceived benefits, and lack of knowledge of e-commerce technology are reasons for the delay of e-readiness in developing countries (UnitedNations, 2001).

In an effort to augment the understanding of EDI adoption in China's hospitals, the differences between hospital levels are discussed next. This study did show some differences between the Level III hospitals and the lower-level hospitals, although these differences were much less than expected. Based on the authors\u2019 observation, the differences among hospital levels can be illustrated in three aspects: resources availability, government-driven adoption, and market position. First, Level III hospitals have more resources, thus more capabilities to implement EDI than lower-level hospitals (Level I and Level II). The resources include financial resources, human resources, and IT resources. Second, Level III hospitals tend to be early adopters of information systems due to the government's requests. In China, it is a common strategy for the MOH and local governments to use several Level III hospitals to develop or experiment with innovations. If the experiments are successful, the Level III hospitals will become \u201cmodel hospitals\u201d and their experiences will be shared by other hospitals which will become followers. For example, the China Golden Health project requires high-level hospitals to take initiatives earlier than low-level hospitals. This national project entails building hospital information systems, insurance accounting and payment networks, and telemedicine, and the objective is to electronically link stakeholders in the healthcare systems to improve management and quality of care. Given that Level III hospitals are early innovators taking part in this project, it is a rational anticipation that they will have more inter- and intra-organizational electronic connectivity than lower-level hospitals.",

For example, outpatient registration fees are determined by the healthcare policy in China. The registration fee difference between Level III hospitals and lower-level hospitals is approximately USD $0.2. Since the fee difference is so small, many patients are willing to pay more to go to Level III hospitals where they think better care can be provided. As a result, Level I and Level II hospitals have few outpatient visits while Level III hospitals have long waiting lines. This situation affects hospitals\u2019 strategic foci. For Level III hospitals, the focus is likely to be on performance improvement by leveraging IT so that their competitive advantages can be sustained. For lower-level hospitals, patient attraction is a critical issue with the first priority and they are more likely to invest on marketing rather than IT. By explicating these three differences, some insights are offered regarding the phenomena of EDI usage in the different levels of hospitals.",

The hardware configuration included two IBM servers, one with 128 megabytes of main memory and four gigabytes of hard drive capacity, and the other with 512 megabytes of main memory and 10 gigabytes of hard drive capacity. These servers are simply not powerful enough to support information-intensive tasks such as EDI. In addition, the client computers at this hospital have only 16 megabytes of main memory and 540 megabytes of hard drive capacity. With such a limited hardware configuration, the online transaction speed will be greatly affected and the advantages of information systems in general, and EDI in particular, cannot be realized.
