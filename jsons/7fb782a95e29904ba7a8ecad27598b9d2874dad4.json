The annual proportion of hospital admissions with antibiotics dispensed was estimated and stratified by age group. An interrupted time series analysis was conducted to examine any potential change in tetracycline dispensing after the release of the new clinical practice guideline. Results A total of 35,535,506 antibiotic prescriptions were dispensed among 2,161,360 unique hospitalized patients from 2000 to 2015. Antibiotics were dispensed in 29.2% of all hospital admissions in the public hospitals, the annual proportions of hospital admissions with antibiotics dispensed increased over the study period from 27.87% in 2000 to 31.39% in 2015, ranging from 27.17 to 31.39%. However, a significant increase was only observed in age groups of 5-19, 20-44, and 85 years or above when stratifying by age. In the interrupted time series analysis, a change in trend was detected for tetracycline dispensing that coincided with the time of publication of the new clinical practice guideline. Conclusions We found that the overall volume of antibiotic use increased between 2000 and 2015. The rise in the dispensing of carbapenems in our study is concerning. The significant change in tetracycline use after being recommended as one of the preferred regimens demonstrated that the change in the clinical practice guideline had an immediate effect on the antibiotic prescribing practice in Hong Kong public hospitals.",

            "text": "In the past decade, antibiotic consumption has increased by 65% globally, with a particularly concerning increase in the use of last-resort antibiotic drug classes including carbapenems and polymyxins [8, 9] . In 2013, the WHO organized the first meeting to work on the strategic plan and priority activities to tackle AMR; the subsequent endorsement of the Global Action Plan on Antimicrobial Resistance was proposed in May 2015 [1] . Since then, there have been sparse longitudinal data on antibiotic use. There is an urgent need to examine antibiotic prescribing patterns after the adoption of this global action plan. According to the statistics from the Department of Health of Hong Kong, the number of community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) cases notified to the Centre for Health Protection of the Department of Health has increased five-fold from 2008 to 2016. When compared to other countries, the proportions of resistant bacterial isolates were at a high level in Hong Kong in both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, as indicated in the data on S. aureus resistant to methicillin and Escherichia coli resistant to third-generation cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones from the Hong Kong Hospital Authority [10] . In light of the emergence of resistant pathogens, the Centre for Health Protection, Health Authority, and experts from local universities published the Inter-hospital Multi-disciplinary Programme on Antimicrobial ChemoTherapy (IMPACT) guideline [11] , which is a collection of evidence-based recommendations for clinical antibiotic prescribing in combating AMR in the clinical setting. The IMPACT guideline was first released in 1999; the fifth edition published in 2017 being the latest. Throughout the years, new editions of IMPACT were published with changes in recommendation on prescribing practices based on new evidence. The effect of such changes on the actual prescribing practice should also be examined. This study aims to describe the antibiotic dispensing patterns in public hospitals in Hong Kong from 2000 to 2015 and the characteristics of antibiotic users.",

A segmented linear regression was conducted using the R-package \"segmented\". The breakpoint was automatically estimated in the model rather than being pre-specified. If a significant change in the dispensing trend was identified shortly after the publication of the updated IMPACT guideline (fourth edition), it might indicate that changes in the guideline did have an impact on the prescribing practices in the public hospitals.",

Primary diagnosis was considered to ensure the antibiotic prescription was dispensed for treatment of the primary infections rather than for treatment of secondary infections or prophylaxis. These diagnoses were categorized into the following infection groups based on the previous literature [21] : (1) Pneumonia (ICD-9: 481-486); (2) skin and subcutaneous infections (ICD-9: 680-686); and (3) septicemia (ICD-9: 038). Although the WHO recommends the defined daily dose as the unit for drug utilization studies [22] , it only reflects drug use for defined major indications among adults. Therefore, the DOT was used in this study instead to examine the drug utilization among patients of different age groups. To estimate the annual DOT per hospital bed-day, we summed the prescription duration in days of all antibiotic prescriptions for admissions with the above-selected bacterial infections as the primary discharge diagnosis and divided by the sum of hospital bed-days of these admissions. To ensure the validity and reliability of the data on prescription duration, only antibiotics dispensed on or after year 2004 were included in this part of the analysis. Dispensing records with a missing prescription duration in days were excluded from this analysis. All analyses were conducted using R 3.1.2 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria) and SAS 9.4 (SAS Inc., Cary, NC, USA). The most commonly dispensed antibiotics were amoxicillin-clavulanate (co-amoxiclav), cefuroxime, metronidazole, piperacillin-tazobactam, levofloxacin, cloxacillin, ampicillin, cefoperazone, ceftriaxone, and ciprofloxacin. These ten antibiotics accounted for 68% of all antibiotics dispensed to the inpatients admitted during the study period. A total of 15% of admissions had antibiotic prescriptions with a switched route of administration from oral to parenteral, whilst around 29% switched from parenteral to oral within one admission. When comparing the first and last antibiotic prescriptions within the same hospital admission, 20.3% switched from parenteral to oral whilst 57.3% remained the same route (38.7% for oral and 18.6% for parenteral). The most common primary discharge diagnoses were listed in Table 1 for all hospital admissions with antibiotics dispensed. Pneumonia was the most common diagnosis with an antibiotic dispensed, followed by chronic airway obstruction. General symptoms, the fifth most common diagnosis associated with antibiotic dispensing, did not provide adequate details of the hospital admission. Therefore, we examined the second-listed diagnosis among hospitalizations with general symptoms as the primary discharge diagnosis (Appendix 2).",

The increase in the dispensed \u00df-lactamase inhibitor combinations may account for the overall increase in antibiotic use in all admissions given that the majority of the prescriptions were co-amoxiclav. The average overall proportion of hospital admissions with at least one antibiotic prescription (29.2%) estimated in our study was slightly lower than that (34.4%) from the recently published Global Point Prevalence Survey study based on the data collected from 53 countries in 2015 [23] , while penicillins in combination with \u03b2-lactamase inhibitors were the most commonly dispensed antibiotic drug class in both studies. The primary discharge diagnoses associated with hospitalization with antibiotics dispensed were mostly infections such as pneumonia, other disorders of the urethra and urinary tract (inclusive of urinary tract infection), and cellulitis. Chronic airway obstruction was the second most common diagnosis among all hospitalizations with antibiotics dispensed. As infection is a known common co-morbidity of chronic airway obstruction, the antibiotics that were dispensed in these episodes might be for the treatment of such a co-morbidity [24, 25] . The most common secondary diagnoses of hospitalization with \"general symptoms\" as the primary discharge diagnosis included essential hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and some other non-specific conditions (Appendix 2).",

In addition, bacterial load in MRSA carriers was indicated to be related to the use of fluoroquinolones and \u00df-lactam therapy [29] . Therefore, the rise in dispensing of \u00df-lactams including carbapenems in our study was concerning especially when carbapenems, as one of the last-resort antibiotics, had been increasingly dispensed as the first antibiotic dispensed over the study period. The decrease in the use of broad-spectrum penicillins as first-line antibiotics was probably owing to the preference for \u00df-lactamase inhibitor combinations, such as co-amoxiclav, with a broader spectrum against Gramnegative bacteria. This might also indicate an increasing prevalence of AMR in the hospital setting or a conservative prescribing behavior in choosing broad-spectrum antibiotics. A previous study showed that inappropriate empirical antibiotic treatment was an independent risk factor for 30-day mortality in patients with Klebsiella pneumoniae bacteremia [30] . Given the rapidly increasing use of \u00df-lactamase inhibitor combination drugs such as co-amoxiclav as a first-line drug, further investigation into the appropriate use of antibiotics may be needed to prevent the development of resistance and improve the outcome of clinical treatment. It is also worth noting that in addition to clinical use of antibiotics in humans, multiple factors might have been driving the development of AMR including antibiotics used in agriculture and veterinary medicine [31, 32] . Stakeholders should work together within the one-health framework to effectively combat AMR.",

Linezolid, indicated to treat MRSA infections, was the second most commonly dispensed WHO reserve antibiotic in this study. The increasing dispensing of linezolid was largely consistent with the change in the prevalence [34, 35] . Although the observed associations [6, 7, 36] might not necessarily indicate a causal relationship between antibiotic exposure and development of resistance, the use of the WHO reserve antibiotics should be continuously monitored. With this large dataset, we were able to identify an effect of the change in clinical practice guideline on the actual dispensing patterns in hospitals. In the interrupted time series analysis, tetracycline use increased significantly after being added as one of the preferred regimens of the fourth IMPACT guideline published in 2012, whilst during the same time no change was observed in macrolide prescriptions, which presumably should not be affected by the guideline update. Tetracycline remained the preferred regimens for hospitalized community-acquired pneumonia in the latest edition of the IMPACT guideline [11] . Our analysis demonstrated that the change in the clinical practice guideline had an immediate effect on the antibiotic prescribing practice. Should there be any need to change the prescribing practice in the future, changing the clinical practice guideline in public hospitals can be considered as one of the channels for better implementation.",

Admissions related to skin and subcutaneous infections had the highest DOT because of the shortest hospitalday but the highest number of antibiotics dispensed among these admissions. In line with the empirical treatment recommended by the local IMPACT guideline [11] , co-amoxiclav and cloxacillin were the most commonly dispensed antibiotics for pneumonia and skin and soft-tissue infections, respectively, indicating a good adherence to local clinical practice guidelines among public hospitals in Hong Kong.",

Based on the currently available data, we were unable to determine the indication for which the antibiotic was dispensed. Therefore, we could not rule out the possibilities that some antibiotics were dispensed for infection control or surgical prophylaxis. This is a common limitation of using healthcare records to conduct population-based studies. However, we are confident that the study population had good compliance with the antibiotics dispensed based on stringent medication administration protocols within the hospital. Therefore, the dispensing records should closely reflect the actual usage among the inpatients. Second, this study only included antibiotic use data from public hospitals in Hong Kong. According to the recently published wholesale supply data of antibiotics in Hong Kong [37] , the Hospital Authority is the second largest sector, purchasing 20% of all antibiotics supplied in Hong Kong, whilst only 4-5% were supplied to private hospitals. This ratio of antibiotic supply to public versus private hospitals is consistent with the fact that around 80% of all local hospital admissions occur in public hospitals and 20% occur in private hospitals. However, more than 50% of the antibiotics supplied to the outpatient sector were consumed by the private general practitioners. Further studies on antibiotic use in the private outpatient healthcare sector are urgently needed.",

Future policies in changing clinical practice with antibiotics may be implemented through modifying the recommendations in the clinical practice guidelines. See Table 4 . ",
