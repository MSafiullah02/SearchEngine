MMTV/PyMT transgenic model of metastatic mammary tumor showed that thoracic irradiation at 10 Gy by shielding other portions of the body enhanced lung surface metastasis by threefold at 2 weeks after irradiation. This took place in a manner dependent on TGF\u03b21 in the tumor cells, because conditional depletion of TGF\u03b2RII using Cre/Lox technology reversed the effect. TGF\u03b21, which is induced by irradiation in a tumor-independent manner, is thought to facilitate directly the survival of the tumor cells. In this case, the lungs were not irradiated to cause inflammation but tumor burden by itself induce premetastatic conditions in the lungs and irradiation-induced serum TGF\u03b21 activates CTC to reach the lungs.",

Readers should remember that the organ first encountered by circulating tumor cells from the primary tumor is liver by CRC, lungs by any tumors that do not drain into the portal vein, and any organs by lung cancer. A more focused analysis of chronic viral hepatitis (CVH) B and C, liver metastasis took place in 2.86% (2 of 70 cases) compared with 16.9% (48 of 284) in non-CVH. In C57BL/6 mice with cirrhosis, which was induced by carbon tetrachloride gastrogavage for 2 months, B16F1 melanoma cell injection via the portal vein caused seven- to ninefold increase in frequency of tumor in the liver by histological analysis in cirrhosis over the untreated group [4]. No surface metastatic nodules were found in the lungs. Intravital kinetic analysis showed that the tumor cell movement was slower in the cirrhotic group. Given the presence of regeneration, fiber generation and inflammatory cells in both clinical autopsy and experimental mouse settings, I assume that inflammatory nature in the liver and its matching with tumor cell property may make a difference.",

However, LPS promotes tumor cell migration in vivo [5]. Supportive evidence has been provided by experiments in which direct intratracheal administration of either Escherichia coli or LPS before injection of tumor cells, such as B16F10 melanoma or RM-9 cells, through the tail vein enhanced lung metastasis at 14 days after tumor challenge [6]. Tumor cell injection at any time points earlier than 6 h, but not later than 3 days, of LPS was effective for the enhancement. BAL fluid 6 h after LPS had increased amounts of IL-6, G-CSF, KC, SDF-1, and extracellular ubiquitin. The major chemokine receptor of neutrophils in acute lung inflammation is CXCR2, which is activated by MIP-2 and KC (remember that KC is a rodent version of IL-8 in humans). As with TLR4, CXCR2 is expressed in both blood and non-blood cells, both of which contribute to neutrophil accumulation and pulmonary permeability in the lungs. Both ubiquitin and SFD-1 are known to bind CXCR4, and CXCR4 inhibitor AMD3100 blocked the enhancement of metastasis. The reasonable but important point is that they found no metastasis in the extrapulmonary organs. In our laboratory, LPS administration through a catheter only to the left bronchus with microspheres to make sure of the stimulation sites induced vascular permeability at 48 h and accumulation of intravenously injected labeled tumor cells in the left but not right lung. Therefore, a local TLR4 activation of a given pulmonary segment causes a limited inflammatory space to which tumor cells are allowed to metastasize. If the lung TLR4 is activated by an endocrine manner, the whole lungs should be transformed to be premetastatic soil.",

Rheumatoid arthritis mouse model by type II collagen injection was performed intradermally at 9 weeks of MMTV-PyMT mice to induce arthritis in 11\u201313 weeks of tumor development [7]. The combined systems at early developmental stages of mammary tumor are assumed to see the systemic inflammatory effect at the premetastatic phase. Bone metastasis took place only in the arthritis mice, and more than twofold increase in lung metastasis was observed in the same group. The arthritis induction caused leukocyte infiltration in the lungs, which was enhanced by roughly fourfold in the background of mammary tumor. Elevation of factors in the lungs and circulation was detected, including IL-17, IL-6, and PGE2. Anti-IL-17 antibody and COX-2 inhibitor both reduced the metastasis. The same group demonstrated that arthritis induced mast cell recruitment in the lungs in a tumor-independent manner, but tumor cell engagement enhanced the mast cell activation underpinning the enhanced metastasis [8]. Anti-c-Kit antibody also was effective to reduce metastasis. Importantly, the detailed experiments tell us that premetastatic soil can be cultivated by inflammation of other organs.",

Orthotopic RENCA tumor model and LLC footpad model also aggravated lung metastasis in DSCR-1-KO mice, while growth of the primary tumor was suppressed as just described. The difference between the primary sites and metastatic lungs turned out to be Ang2 expression in the lungs without endothelial apoptosis. Up-regulation of both VEGF and activated VEGFR2 was recognized in the tumor-injected DSCR-1-KO mice.",

In addition, stimulation of metastasis after removal of LLC primary tumor was further augmented in the background of those EET-high mice. I underline that they observed that the affected metastatic organs were multiple, including lymph nodes, liver, and lungs even without removal of the primary tumor. The EET-high tumor-bearing mice after tumor removal showed high levels of plasma VEGF and the resected tumor expressed high VEGF mRNAs. Most importantly and intriguingly, the authors performed parabiosis experiments to share circulation between, for example, a tumor-bearing Tie2-sEH-KO mouse as a donor with high EET and a Tie2-sEH-tg mouse as a recipient with low EET. This parabiosis gave enhanced tumor growth but the opposite condition, i.e., tumor in EET-low mice failed to enhance it. The shared high levels of EET were not sufficient to enhance tumor growth and endothelial EET levels were critical. It also was the case in metastasis.

The binding domain is localized in the C-terminal 30 amino acids S100A8 [60\u201389], which is supported by the results of docking simulation [43].

S100A8 from endothelial cells is secreted into the interstitium where macrophages are located and stimulated to secrete SAA3. The interstitial SAA3 then stimulates TLR4 expressed in club cells in the terminal bronchiole regions, a preferential site of lung metastasis. Club cells then express SAA3, which stimulates their own TLR4 resulting in autoamplification of SAA3 [54] (Fig. 15.2). At this stage, the paracrine cascade starting from CCL2 may be dispensable for the establishment of premetastatic milieu even if the primary tumor is removed.

While Gr1- monocytes were recruited in the primary tumor, Gr1- monocytes were mobilized to the late-stage lung metastatic lesions and forced pulmonary metastatic nodules by intravenous injection of a PyMT-induced mouse mammary tumor cell line ( Met-1), and intriguingly lungs 7 h after intravenous injection of Met-1 cells before extravasation in the lungs, but not 7-week-old PyMT mice with yet premalignant mammary tumors presumably without expression of CCL2 even if they make an entry into circulation. High levels of CCR2 expression were observed in the recruited Gr1- monocytes. Notably, CCL2 expression levels in tumor cells were homogenous in the metastatic lung nodules but heterogenous in the primary tumor. Therefore, CCL2 expression appears to confer a metastatic trait on the tumor cells. Given that even CTC expressing CCL2 alone without primary tumor induced Gr1+ monocytes in the lung, augmented levels of CCL2 in circulation may be misrecognized by Gr1+ monocytes in the bone marrow as a danger producing CCL2 in the lungs. The recruited monocytes are destined to prepare premetastatic soil by producing VEGF in contact with CCL2-secreting tumor cells and VEGF works in concert with CCL2 to facilitate tumor cell extravasation into the lungs. They showed that myeloid cell-specific conditional knockout of VEGF by the tamoxifen-inducible system linked to the CSF1-R promoter abrogated the tumor cell seeding in the lungs. VEGF by itself was not required for the recruitment of Gr1- monocytes since VEGF-null monocytes were recruited at similar levels to the control.",

The frequency of metastasis by 5 years after breast cancer surgery was 40% in D299G patients compared with 26.5% in those without polymorphism, suggesting the polymorphism is loss of defensive function [58]. Autosomal recessive mutations in MyD88 within the IRAK4-interacting domain, such as L93P result in failed interaction with IRAK4 leading to severe infection with pyrogenic bacteria during the early infancy [59]. Compared with reactions in the initial exposures to exogenous bacteria in neonates, those in early adolescence get less and less severe. Conversely, a gain of function mutation L265P in MyD88, which results in constitutive MyD88 signaling with production of cytokines, such as IL-6, can facilitate diffuse large B-cell lymphoma progression [60]. Thus, the TLR4-MyD88 pathway appears to be defensive against bacteria and tumor progression, but too much defensive reaction favors tumor progression.",

Because no expression of human SAA3 has been reported so far, it has been assumed to a pseudogene. Although we could not find human SAA3 transcripts in the database of the expressed pseudogenes in tumor cells [97], elaborate qPCP analysis of human lung cancer samples in our laboratory revealed that there exists a chimeric SAA2-SAA3 fusion mRNAs [98]. The human SAA2 exon3 is connected to the human SAA3 exon2 with roughly 200 kb between the 2 exons to yield the SAA2-SAA3 fusion protein that could be recognized by a monoclonal antibody against the unique sequence of human SAA3. The corresponding gene product activates Erk by binding and stimulating LOX-1, an endothelial cell-specific scavenger for oxidized LDL. The binding affinity was 206 nM as judged by ELISA between C-terminal synthetic 26-mer human SAA3 peptide and soluble LOX-1.

Levels of SAA3 mRNA in epididymal adipose tissue and colon of germ-free Swiss-Webster mice were approximately ten- and sevenfold, respectively, higher than those raised conventionally. MyD88-KO reduced the SAA3 mRNA levels by sixfold compared with the wild type. LPS simulates TLR4 in the colon epithelial cells as well as macrophages to induce SAA3 expression. Serum levels of SAA3 in conventionally raised mice were higher than those in germ-free mice and LPS administration induced SAA3 expression in adipose tissue. Given that both authentic ligand LPS and endogenous one SAA3 bind TLR4 in adipose tissue macrophages to secrete SAA3 by a feed-forward mechanism. Thus LPS-triggered and autoamplified SAA3 production stimulates myeloid cell mobilization from bone marrow resulting in accumulation of macrophages in both tissues. The inflammatory response in both colon and adipose tissue is stabilized at homeostatic levels. We should pay attention to the mechanism by which LPS-induced inflammation in colon can spread to other tissue(s) if LPS can induce expression of endogenous TLR4 ligands, because they can function as LPS in bacteria-free tissues.",

Up-regulation of TNF\u03b1, S100A8, and SAA3 was found in the skin lesions, which were sensitive to UVB at 500 J/m2 to induce apoptosis [102].

Exogenously borne microbes through the airway induce mobilization of bone marrow-derived myeloid cells (BMDC) to the lungs. The triggering mechanism may involve microbial LPS that activates TLR4 in club cells in terminal bronchioles. The paracrine signaling goes in the direction to the circulation side. Expression of endogenous ligands, such as S100A8 and SAA3, in endothelial cells in sterile premetastatic lungs is induced by primary tumor-derived growth factors, such as CCL2, from the circulation side and the paracrine signaling goes in an opposite direction from the circulation to airway side to result in amplification of SAA3 in club cells. Bone marrow may misrecognize those endogenous ligands as LPS derived from lung infection and mobilize the myeloid cells there to battle against the phantom microbes",
