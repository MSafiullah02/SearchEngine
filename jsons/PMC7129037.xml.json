            "text": "Before the advent of modern genetic analysis, diagnosis of diseases was a cumbersome process that sometimes involved lengthy culturing of pathogens and analysis of species-specific markers. This could take days to complete, during which disease progression also worsened. Consequently, mortality rate did not only depend on the availability of appropriate drugs to treat a disease but also on the accuracy and speed of diagnosis. The detection of DNA or RNA is now used not only to identify disease states but also to identify mutated genes that could predispose one to certain diseases. Classic examples are BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes, which when mutated are known to drastically increase a woman\u2019s risk of breast cancer [1]. In the last few decades several workers have developed sensitive detection of DNA or RNA using either organic or nanoparticle fluorescent [2], [3], [4], electrochemical [5], [6], [7], colorimetric (usually via horseradish peroxidase or alkaline phosphatase) [8], [9], [10], [11] tags or even personal glucose meters [12]. Protein-based nucleic acid detection methods, such as those that use peroxidases, require refrigeration for reagent storage and are not ideal for resource-poor areas or field detection.",

Following the seminal discovery by Sen [18] that DNA G-quadruplexes can enhance hemin peroxidation [19], there has been an explosion of the use of G-quadruplexes for the detection of DNA, RNA and other molecules, including proteins, small molecules as well as metals. The advantage of using DNAzymes for diagnostics is that they can be stored as lyophilized powders at ambient temperatures, without significant degradation and can be reconstituted into active enzymes by simply dissolving in a buffer containing monovalent cations, such as potassium, sodium or ammonium [20].",

Additionally, in contrast to Kolpashchikov\u2019s turn-on strategy, Willner\u2019s approach uses a chemiluminescence turn-off probe to detect the target DNA. In the absence of target DNA, the two split G-quadruplex probes associate with each other to form a peroxidase mimicking G-quadruplex. However, when the two probes bind to a DNA analyte, the G-rich regions are too far from each other to reconstitute into a G-quadruplex and therefore the chemiluminescent signal is reduced. A detection limit of 600 nM was obtained with this system, which is still impressive considering that it is a turn-off assay, which are known to be less sensitive than turn-on approaches.",

In their study, they detected gene deletion in the CCR5 gene (CCR5-\u039432) by designing a split G-quadruplex with recognition sequences, which would bind the sequences that flank the deletion target. For an intact gene, the two split G-quadruplex probes would be too far apart to reconstitute into a G-quadruplex. However, when the region between the two binding sites of the two probes gets deleted, the two G-rich probes are now brought into close proximity for effective reconstitution into a G-quadruplex.

Zhou and co-workers have used an asymmetric split G-quadruplex, and ABTS as the peroxidase substrate, to detect fragments of HIV genes, HIV-1 (NL4-3) or HIV-1 (HXB2), at a concentration of 5 nM [27].

That is, is topology of the DNAzyme important for binding of hemin or the actual oxidation of peroxidase substrates or both? A few groups have demonstrated that parallel G-quadruplexes, but not anti-parallel G-quadruplexes, are good peroxidase enzymes. In 2011, the Sintim group demonstrated that anti-parallel G-quadruplexes are equally as good peroxidase enzymes as parallel G-quadruplexes when the hemin cofactor was covalently linked to the DNAzyme (Fig. 7\n) [41]. Thus, it was concluded that topology is important for hemin binding and not necessarily for catalytic activity. When hemin was covalently attached to single stranded DNA (ssDNA) that could not form G-quadruplex, peroxidation enhancement was minimal, implying that the G-tetrad floor was a prerequisite for nucleic acid peroxidation enhancement of hemin. Based on the observation that the covalent linkage of hemin to G-quadruplexes overcomes any limitation that is imposed by the G-quadruplex topology, attempts were made by the Sintim group to detect nucleic acids using probes that are covalently linked to hemin (see Section 2.2.2).",

Sintim and Nakayama therefore wondered if they could detect nucleic acids using two probes, whereby one probe contained a preformed G-quadruplex and the other, a covalently linked hemin cofactor (Fig. 8\n). The rationale behind this design is that the probe that contains G-quadruplex but no hemin would be unable to catalyze peroxidation because hemin is required for the oxidation whereas the other probe that is covalently linked to hemin but does not contain a G-quadruplex would also have low peroxidation efficiency because the G-quadruplex motif is a necessity for nucleic acid enhanced peroxidation. In line with this expectation, in the presence of target analyte the G-quadruplex/hemin\u2013DNA conjugate probe combination gave a higher peroxidation than both probes in the absence of target (Fig. 9\n). However, the background from the hemin\u2013DNA conjugate probe alone was too high to allow for a sensitive detection of DNA. It appears that although non-G-quadruplex DNAs are not good peroxidases, when covalently attached to hemin, some peroxidation can occur, albeit not as effectively as when G-quadruplex motif is present.",

The 420 nm light emitted from the oxidized luminol (chemiluminescence) excited the QD, which then emitted 620 nm light (Fig. 11\n). The overall process is termed a chemiluminescence resonance energy transfer (CRET).

When there is no target DNA, and both molecular beacons are intact, the probe can form a complete G-quadruplex, resulting in an active DNAzyme peroxidase. However, in the presence of target DNA, MB-I unfolds resulting in the unfolding of the G-quadruplex as well. The turn-off probe gives rise to a limit of detection of 5.4 nM. The other stem-loop (MB-II) contains an aptamer for thrombin. Thus in the presence of thrombin, MB-II unfolds to bind to thrombin (which is also a G-quadruplex structure).

The molecular beacon probe had a symmetric split G-quadruplex at the 3\u2032- and 5\u2032-termini. When blocker DNA is bound, the two halves of the G-quadruplex could associate to form an active DNAzyme leading to a colorimetric signal by oxidation of ABTS. However, when the blocker DNA, associates with the MB the split G-quadruplex is broken and no signal is observed. To create a turn on probe the authors used the blocker DNA in a two-step amplification process, in which the blocker DNA would lose affinity for the MB and bind the DNA analyte of interest resulting in the molecular beacon refolding and forming an active G-quadruplex peroxidase. Once the target DNA and the blocker DNA are bound (step 1), a primer associates (step 2) and DNA polymerase extends the primer (step 3) resulting in the target DNA falling off (step 4). The target DNA may then associate with another blocker DNA resulting in the reformation of another active G-quadruplex-MB peroxidase thereby creating a turn on probe for this system.",

Willner and co-workers showed that upon binding of a target to a MB G-quadruplex probe that was attached to a gold electrode, a G-quadruplex forms. Upon the addition of hemin, this DNAzyme reduces H2O2, which can be detected by the gold electrode resulting in a detection limit of 1 pM [35].",

Thus the target brings the G-quadruplex, QD and the gold electrode in close proximity. The G-quadruplex/hemin complex is used to oxidize luminol and the light produced is transferred to the QD (CRET). Upon excitation, the excited QD transfers electrons to the Au-electrode, which is then measured as an electrical signal (Fig. 17\n) [36].",

RCA of circular DNA using RNA polymerase to make long RNA has also been described [54], [55]. In a study done by Willner and co-workers, a RCA machine was employed, which allowed the circular ssDNA template to recognize a target DNA sequence which then acts as a primer [56]. Once the primer is hybridized with the circular DNA, RCA was used to create a sequence of tethered G-quadruplexes [56].

NESA obviates the need for a 1:1 binding stoichiometry of DNA probe to target DNA. This allows amplification of signal from minimal amounts of target DNA. Chen and co-workers used an endonuclease amplification approach, in conjunction with a gold immobilized DNA to detect oligonucleotides (Fig. 19\n) [60]. A sequence containing a 3\u2032-terminal thiol group, a G-rich sequence and a sensing sequence was immobilized on a gold electrode [60]. Upon hybridization of the target sequence to the immobilized DNA the endonuclease nicks the DNA thus cleaving it from the G-rich sequence still attached to the gold and the G-rich sequence was then allowed to fold into a G-quadruplex and the excess DNA could be washed away [60]. The immobilized G-quadruplex was then used to oxidize TMB (3,3\u2032,5,5\u2032-tetramethylbenzidine), using a hemin/H2O2 system [60]. The peroxidation reaction could be followed by either a color change or an increase in current across the electrode [60]. This method allowed for the detection of DNA at a concentration as little as 0.02 fM [60].",

The target molecule could then bind another DNA probe and continue signal amplification.

In this work, they utilized a DNAzyme cascade to produce a folded G-quadruplex capable of a colorimetric output by the oxidation of ABTS. In this system, two probes hybridize with the DNA analyte forming a duplex. Each probe contains an overhang, which can form an active, Mg2+-dependent DNAzyme that can nick RNA. In addition, the overhangs contain a region, which hybridizes with a pseudo-circular DNA, which contains two G-rich regions capable of forming a G-quadruplex. Each of these G-rich regions is, however, blocked by a small DNA as to prevent G-quadruplex folding. After hybridization with the target DNA the active DNA machine assembles. In the presence of Mg2+, the DNAzyme then nicks the circular DNA next to an inserted rA nucleobase. This results in the release of the G-rich regions and as a result these sequences fold and carry out the oxidation of ABTS in the presence of hemin.",

Upon addition of adenosine, the adenosine aptamer binds adenosine and converts to a G-quadruplex. This G-quadruplex is more sterically demanding than the ssDNA aptamer alone. As a consequence, a larger concentration of ssDNA remains unassociated with the gold surface, which oligreen can then bind and in turn fluoresce. If however, adenosine is absent the majority of the ssDNA aptamer associates with the gold surface. Although oligreen still binds this ssDNA its fluorescence is quenched by the gold nanoparticle resulting in no signal. This system allows for a 5.5 nM, turn on detection of adenosine [79].",

In the last decade or so, it has been shown that there is more to G-quadruplexes than just cancer studies and that they can also be used for sensitive detection of nucleic acids and other analytes. Despite the enormous progress that has been made in G-quadruplex-based detection protocols, there is still room for improvement. G-quadruplexes enhance hemin peroxidation but hemin on its own has some residual peroxidation activity so future studies that could help suppress the peroxidation of hemin, when not complexed to G-quadruplexes, could enhance the sensitivity of G-quadruplex-based peroxidations. Additionally the development of assay conditions [112], [113], [114] or G-quadruplex modifications [115] that enhance catalysis should allow sensitive detection of nucleic acids and other analytes. Recently a few reports have also shown that nucleotides as well as simple guanine based molecules can also catalyze peroxidation reactions [116], [117], [118], [119]. The incorporation of these nucleotide-based peroxidations into methodologies that detect other analytes could be forthcoming.",
