Results from long-term follow-up are not yet available, and it remains to be seen whether a quadrivalent or bivalent HPV vaccine will elicit a response similar to that produced by a monovalent hepatitis B vaccine. Additionally, it is very likely that the observed weak cross-reactivity with types 31, 33, and 45 will require a booster injection after 10\u201315 years, given the current vaccination protocol.",

It would be short-sighted to disregard the large number of cervical lesions that develop after infections with high-risk HPV types requiring surgical interventions. Since cervical cancer is caused by HPV infections, the most effective strategy to prevent this cancer, its precursor lesions, and the associated pain and suffering is the prevention of infection.",

Although the initial expense will be higher, additionally accounting for the prevention of HPV-linked cancers in men (eg, anal, penile, and oropharyngeal cancers) will make this approach cost effective. The eventual eradication, or even a drastic reduction in the rate of HPV infections, will require vaccination of both sexes.",
