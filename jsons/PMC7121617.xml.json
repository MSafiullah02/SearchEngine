            "text": "Plants contain a wide array of phytochemicals, which have traditionally been utilized for centuries in folk medicines or ethnomedicines. The earliest information on the medicinal use of plants comes from China in 5000 BC (Greathead 2003), from India (in Rigveda and Atharvaveda) in 2000 BC (Ramawat et al. 2008), from Mesopotamia in 2600 BC (Newman et al. 2000), and also from Egypt in about 1550 BC (Davidson and Naidu 2000). The natural medicines were widely used until the first half of the twentieth century, when a shift towards synthetic medicines that were more effective, patentable and highly profitable, occurred (Tyler 1999). However, there have been increasing interests towards use of natural chemicals in medicinal purposes in recent years. These ethnomedicines are encouraging for both the public and national health care institutions as alternatives to synthetic drugs due to relatively lower incidences of adverse reactions compared to modern conventional pharmaceuticals along with their reduced cost (Nair et al. 2005).",

The ethnopharmacologists, botanists, microbiologists and natural-product chemists are constantly in search of medicinal efficacy of plants and their phytochemicals, since the reported data so far available on plants are comparatively meager compared to the vast number of plant population. Plants produce a great diversity of compounds. The structures of close to 50,000 compounds have already been elucidated and there are perhaps hundreds of thousands of such compounds in plants (Pichersky and Gang 2000). Only a few of these are part of \u2018primary\u2019 metabolic pathways (those common to all organisms). The rest are secondary metabolites or phytochemicals whose biosynthesis is restricted to selected plant groups (Pichersky and Gang 2000). Phytochemicals can be divided into many major classes depending upon the chemical structures, botanical origins, biosynthesis pathways or biological properties. The most phytochemical classification scheme is based on chemical structures such as phenolics, alkaloids, saponins, terpenoids, limonoids, polyacetylenes and secoiridoids and so on. Numerous studies have been conducted in vitro and in vivo in the recent years on the efficacy of plant phytochemicals as antimicrobial agents. This paper presents the antimicrobial properties of some major group of phytochemicals against pathogenic bacteria, fungi and virus, and beneficial microbes of the gastrointestinal tracts and their mechanism of action.",

The naturally occurring phenolic acids generally have two characteristic constitutive carbon frameworks: the hydroxycinnamic and hydroxybenzoic structures (Robbins 2003). Majority of cinnamic and benzoic acid derivatives in plants are linked through ester, ether or acetal bonds to structural components, polyphenols, organic acids (quinic, maleic, tartaric and shikimic acid), glucose and terpenes (Robbins 2003). Chlorogenic acid is an ester of quinic acid and caffeic acid. Some aldehyde analogues of phenols (e.g. vanillin) are also grouped with phenolic acids (Robbins 2003). The numbers and positions of the hydroxyl and other groups on the aromatic ring can produce a large number of compounds in this subclass (Robbins 2003; Vermerris and Nicholson 2006). Phenolic acids are present in a wide range of plants including in many common foods such as tea, coffee and berries. Besides, phenolic acids and aldehydes could be formed by the intestinal microbial biotransformation of other phenolic compounds in the intestine, where they may influence intestinal microbiota.\n",

Gram-positive bacteria are enclosed in a plasma membrane covered by a thick peptidoglycan wall and lack an outer membrane (Alakomi et al. 2007; Cueva et al. 2010).

Phenolics may selectively suppress or stimulate the growth of certain members of intestinal microbiota, which may influence microbial population dynamics in the gastrointestinal tract (Tzounis et al. 2008). Chlorogenic, quinic and gallic acids stimulated growth of Lactobacillus\ncollinoides relative to control cultures (no additive) up to concentrations of 1 g/L of tomato broth media.

It has been reported that the antimicrobial effect of phenolic acids derivatives increased with the increasing length of the alkyl chain (Merkl et al. 2010). The presence of hydroxyl groups on the phenol groups and oxidized status of phenol groups also determine the toxicity of microbes. The fluidity of the cell membrane could be disturbed with increasing hydrophobic alkyl chains. The phenolic acids could enter the molecular structure of the membrane with the polar hydroxyl group oriented into the aqueous phase by hydrogen bonding and nonpolar carbon chain aligned into the lipid phase by dispersion forces (Kubo et al. 1995). Thus, when the hydrophilic force exceeds hydrophobic one, the activity tends to disappear. Also, the number and position of substitutions in the benzene ring of the phenolic acids and the saturated side-chain length influenced the bacteriocidal effects of phenolic acids against the different microorganisms, but in different ways against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria (Cueva et al. 2010). For example, Cueva et al. (2010) showed that for benzoic and phenylacetic acids, E. coli was inhibited in the following order of potency: non-substituted > 4-hydroxy-3-methoxy- > 3-hydroxy- > 4-hydroxy- > 3,4-dihydroxy-substituted acid. For phenylpropionic acids, the order differed slightly: nonsubstituted > 4-hydroxy- > 3-hydroxy- >3,4-dihydroxysubstituted acid. However, the potency of phenolic acids was in different order for Lactobacillus\nspp. For benzoic acids, the order of potency was: 4-hydroxy- > 3-hydroxy- > non-substituted > 4-hydroxy-3-methoxy- > 3,4-dihydroxy-substituted acids, except for Lactobacillus coryniformis CECT 5711 (4-hydroxy-> non-substituted > 3-hydroxy > 4-hydroxy-3-methoxy-substituted acids). For phenylacetic acids, growth inhibition of lactobacilli was on the order of non-substituted > 3-hydroxy- > 4-hydroxy- > 3,4-dihydroxy-substituted acids. For phenylpropionic acids, growth inhibition was as follows: non-substituted > 4-hydroxy- > 3-hydroxy > 3,4-dihydroxy-substituted acids, except for Lactobacillus fermentum CECT 5716 (3-hydroxy > non-substituted > 4-hydroxy- and 3,4-dihydroxy-substituted acids) and Lactobacillus plantarum LCH17 (non-substituted > 3-hydroxy- > 4-hydroxy-> 3,4-dihydroxy-substituted acids).",

Oz\u00e7elik et al. (2011) investigated the effects of quercitin, apigenin, genistein, naringin, silymarin and silibinin against HSV-1 and PI-3 virus. All flavonoids inhibited HSV-1 activity, but only genistein inhibited parainfluenza type-1 (PI-1) activity. Of the three flavonoids (baicalin, rutin and naringin) examined by Ng et al. 1996, baicalin was found to be the most potent in inhibiting the growth of S. aureus: 11 of the 16 strains tested were inhibited at 128 mg/L. However, no inhibitory activity of rutin and naringin against S. aureus was observed at 128 mg/L. At this concentration, naringin and baicalin inhibited two strains and rutin inhibited one strain of the eight P. aeruginosa strains tested. The flavonoids compounds display different mode of antiviral action. For instance, baicalein probably block human cytomegalovirus infection at entry level while the primary mechanism of action for genistein may be to block immediate-early protein functioning off human cytomegalovirus (Evers et al. 2005). Both these flavoinoids did not inhibit the virus replication (Evers et al. 2005).",

Most abundantly present polyphenolic compounds in plants are tannins, which are usually of two types: hydrolysable tannins (HT) and condensed tannins (CT). The HT are complex molecules with a polyol as a central core such as glucose, glucitol, quinic acids, quercitol and shikimic acid that is partially or totally esterified with a phenolic group, i.e. gallic acid (3,4,5-trihydroxy benzoic acid; gallotannins) or gallic acid dimmer hexahydroxydiphenic acid (ellagitannins) (Haslam 1989). The CT (proanthocyanidins) are mainly polymers of the flavan-3-ols (epi)catechin and (epi)gallocatechin units, which are linked by C4-C8 and C4-C6 interflavonoid linkages (Ferreira et al. 1999; Hagerman and Butler 1989).",

Ellagitannin extracts inhibited a range of pathogenic organisms including Vibrio cholerae\n, Shigella dysenteriae\nand Campylobacter\nspp. (Silva et al. 1997; Puupponen-Pimia et al. 2002). Puupponen-Pimia et al. (2005) reported that berry extracts exhibit selective inhibitory properties against intestinal bacteria such as Staphylococcus\n, Salmonella\n, Listeria\nand Lactobacillus strains, and the selective inhibitory actions varied with berry extracts. In general, pathogenic Staphylococcus and Salmonella were sensitive to various berry extracts and ellagitannins fractions, while pathogenic Listeria and beneficial Lactobacillus were not inhibited. Rauha et al. (2000) studied antimicrobial effects of some berry extracts against food spoilage and poisoning bacteria. The widest antibacterial activity was present in berries belonging to the genus Rubus (cloudberry and raspberry) that are rich in ellagitannins. Ellagic acid has been reported to exhibit a dose-dependent inhibitory effect (IC50  =  1 mM) on Helicobacter pylori isolated from peptic ulcer patients (Chung 1998). Tannins isolated from Dichrostachys cinerea roots exerted antimicrobial effects against S. aureus, E. coli, Shiegella spp. and P. aeruginosa with MIC of the tannins ranging between 4.0 and 5.5 mg/mL, while the MBC ranging between 4.5 and 6.0 mg/mL (Banso and Adeyemo 2007). Gallotannins extracted from the mango seed kernel inhibited the growth of Gram-positive food spoilage bacteria and decreased the growth of Gram-negative E. coli, but did not affect lactic acid bacteria (Engels et al. 2009). The antibacterial properties of cranberry juice with inhibition of E. coli adherence to mucosal surfaces by cranberry juice is reported to be associated with the presence of proanthocyanidins (Howell et al. 1998).",

Thus, polyphenols could be cleaved by bacterial enzymes to form a number of phenolic acids in the intestine, where they may influence the microbial populations (Bock and Ternes 2010). Engels et al. (2009) recently studied the effects of gallotannins with different galloyl units from mango seed kernel on various Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Gallotannins showed antibacterial activities with MICs ranging from 0.1 g/L for S. aureus to 3.3 g/L for Pediococcus acidilactici. They also observed that degree of galloylation did not affect the growth of bacteria. It has been suggested that the antibacterial activities of gallotannins are due to their strong affinity for iron and the inactivation of membrane-bound proteins (Engels et al. 2009). It has also been shown that gallotannins changed the morphology of Bacillus subtilis, which has been hypothesized due to inhibition of cell division by binding of gallotannins to the cell wall or inhibition of enzymes involved in cell separation (Engels et al. 2009).",

            "text": "Antimicrobial activities of garlic and onion against a wide range of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, virus and fungi are known for many years (Ankri and Mirelman 1999). The antifungal activities of garlic oils appear to be more than the antibacterial activity (Avato et al. 2000). Extracts of garlic exhibit the most potent antibacterial activity, followed by onion, and Brassica including cabbage (Kyung and Lee 2001). The principal antimicrobial compounds of Allium and Brassica are allicin (S-allyl-L-propene thiosulfinate) and methyl methanethiosulfinate, respectively (Kyung and Lee 2001). These compounds are derived from S-allyl and S-methyl derivatives of L-cysteine sulfoxide, respectively. Avato et al. (2000) tested different mixtures of garlic distilled oils containing diallyl disulfide (DDS) and diallyl trisulfide (DTS), ranging from 1% to 51% and 88% to 38%, respectively, against yeasts (C. albicans, C. tropicalis and B. capitatus), Gram-positive bacteria (S. aureus and B. subtilis) and Gram-negative bacteria (P. aeruginosa and E. coli). Incubation of garlic extracts made up of 1% DDS and 88% DTS did not show growth inhibition against all the tested microorganisms, whereas garlic oils with higher quantities of DDS showed significant inhibitory activity, increasing with the increase of DDS amount, thus implicating the DDS as the active antimicrobial agent (Avato et al. 2000). It has been reported that allicin (MIC, 6 \u03bcg/mL; MBC, 6 \u03bcg/mL) was more potent than DDS (MIC range, 100\u2013200 \u03bcg/mL; MBC range, 100\u2013200 \u03bcg/mL), its corresponding sulfide, but of a strength similar to that of diallyl tetrasulfide (MIC range, 3\u20136 \u03bcg/mL; MBC range, 3\u20136 \u03bcg/mL) against H. pylori (O\u2019Gara et al. 2000). Kyung and Fleming (1997) investigated the different S-compounds found in cabbages on the growth of 15 bacteria and 4 fungi. S-Methyl-L-cysteine sulfoxide, sinigrin, and dimethyl sulfide at 500 ppm did not inhibit the growth of any of the bacteria and yeasts. Dimethyl disulfide at 500 ppm retarded the growth of some bacteria, but was not bactericidal to any of the test microorganisms. Dimethyl trisulfide, methyl methanethiosulfinate and methyl methanethiosulfonate had MICs of 200 ppm, between 50 and 200 ppm, and between 20 and 100 ppm, respectively for bacteria, and 20 ppm, between 6 and 10 ppm and between 50 and 500 ppm for yeasts, respectively (Kyung and Fleming 1997).",

Intact glucosinolates do not show antimicrobial action, but the hydrolysis products of glucosinolates are active against various microorganisms (Manici et al. 1997; Tierens et al. 2001). Aires et al. (2009a) observed that the in vitro growth inhibition and the sensitivities of the individual bacteria are influenced by the structure of glucosinolates and their hydrolysis products. The most effective glucosinolate hydrolysis products were the isothiocyanates; sulforaphane and benzyl isothiocyanate were the strongest inhibitory against the growth of human pathogenic bacteria. Regarding action of glucosinolates products on the type of bacteria, 4-methyl sulfinyl butylisothiocyanate exhibited antibacterial activity against a larger range of bacteria. Indole-3-carbinol had some inhibitory effects against the Gram-positive bacteria, but had no effect against the Gram-negative bacteria. Indole-3-acetonitrile had some inhibitory activity against the Gram-negative bacteria. Glucosinolates, nitriles and amines were ineffective at the doses up to 3 \u03bcmol (Aires et al. 2009b). Saavedra et al. (2010) evaluated the in vitro antibacterial actions of different classes of common dietary phytochemicals, i.e. simple phenolics \u2013 tyrosol, gallic acid, caffeic acid, ferulic acid, and chlorogenic acid; chalcone \u2013 phloridzin; flavan-3-ol \u2013 (\u2212) epicatechin; secoiridoid \u2013 oleuropein glucoside; glucosinolate hydrolysis products \u2013 allyl isothiocyanate, benzyl isothiocyanate and 2-phenylethyl isothiocyanate) against four pathogenic microbes. All of the isothiocyanates had significant antimicrobial activities, while the phenolics were much less efficient. No antimicrobial activity was observed with phloridzin. Allyl isothiocyanate from cabbage had an MIC between 50 and 500 ppm for bacteria and between 1 and 4 ppm for yeasts (Kyung and Fleming 1997).",

They occur in a wide variety of plants with triterpene saponins (in soybean, alfalfa, quillaja, and guar), and are more widely distributed in nature than steroidal (in yucca, tomato, and oats) saponins (Hostettmann and Marston 1995). The steroidal saponins may possess furostanol or spirostanol (e.g. smilagenin and sarsapogenin) moiety. The saccharide chains are commonly attached at the C3 position (monodesmosidic), but some sapogenins contain two saccharide chains (bidesmosidic) attached at the C3 and C17 (via C28) position (Vincken et al. 2007). A large number of saponins could be possible depending upon the modifications of the ring structure of aglycone moieties and number of sugars added to it, and in turn producing different biological properties.\n",

The structure of sapogenin moiety, chain length and composition of sugars influences the antimicrobial activities. The Y. schidigera saponin fraction possessing a trisaccharide chain without any oxygen functionalities at C-2 and/or C-12 of the aglycone exhibited potent anti-yeast activity, while saponins with 2b-OH or 12-keto groups showed very weak or no activity. Low activity was observed for saponins with a disaccharide chain and no activity was observed for the aglycones obtained after acid hydrolysis (Miyakoshi et al. 2000). Yang et al. (2006a) noted that no activity was observed in the hecogenin saponins when its sugar moiety was less than four monosaccharide units. Pentaglycoside was more active than tetraglycoside and shows extended antifungal spectrum against A. fumigatus. In the diosgenin saponin series, saponins with only triglycosides are active against C. albicans and C. glabrata, while the diosgenin saponins with monoglycoside and diglycoside did not show any activity. Again, within the group of tigogenin saponins, their antifungal capacity was slightly influenced by the composition of the sugar moiety. The replacement of a glucosyl unit with a xylosyl unit showed enhanced activity against A. fumigatus. Avato et al. (2006) suggested that the sugar moiety is not important for the antimicrobial efficacy from their study since antibacterial activity increased from the saponin extracts to the sapogenin samples.",

            "text": "Terpenoid compounds derive from a basic structure of C5 isoprene units. They are classified according to the number of isoprene unit involved for their synthesis, i.e. monoterpenoid (C10), sesquiterpenoids (C15), diterpenoids (C20), sesterterpenoids (C25) and triterpenoids (C30). They can be acyclic (myrcene and geraniol), monocyclic (cymene and carvacrol), bicyclic (pinene) and tricyclic with different groups (alcohol, phenol, and aldehyde). The most commonly occurring essential oils (EO) are included in two chemical groups (Fig. 1.7): terpenoids (monoterpenoids and sesquiterpenoids) and phenylpropanoids, which are synthesized through mevalonate and shikimic acid metabolic pathways, respectively (Gershenzon and Croteau 1991; Calsamiglia et al. 2007). Among these two classes, terpenoids are the more diversified group of plant bioactives abundantly found in many herbs and spices (Gershenzon and Croteau 1991). Within terpenoids, the most important components of EO of the majority of plants belong to the monoterpenoids and sesquiterpenoids (Gershenzon and Croteau 1991; Calsamiglia et al. 2007). Phenylpropanoids have a side chain of three carbons bound to an aromatic ring of C6 (Calsamiglia et al. 2007). Phenylpropanoids are less abundant compounds of EO compared with terpenoid family, but some plants contain in significant proportions. The EO are a group of secondary plant metabolites obtained from volatile fractions of plants by steam distillation process (Gershenzon and Croteau 1991). The EO are used traditionally by humans, for many centuries, which provide characteristic flavor and aroma specific to many plants, and are used as antimicrobial agents and preservatives. The EO have diverse chemical composition, nature and biological properties. The EO can be obtained from flowers, petals, leaves, stems, fruits, roots and barks and the concentrations of EO in these parts depends upon the stage of growth, environmental conditions (Hart et al. 2008).\n",

Curcumin and its derivatives, the phenylpropanoids, are the principal compounds in rhizome of Curcuma longa (turmeric), which exhibit antibacterial properties against different bacteria and fungi. Essential oil fractions of turmeric inhibited the growth of pathogenic Gram-positive (S. aureus and Staphylococcus\nepidermidis) and Gram-negative (E. coli, P. aeruginosa and S. typhimurium) bacteria (Singh et al. 2002). The EO fraction was more effective against Gram-positive compared to Gram-negative strains, and was comparable to standard antibiotics gentamycin, ampicillin, doxycycline and erythromycin in these strains (Singh et al. 2002). A recent study by De et al. (2009) demonstrated that curcumin inhibited the growth of different clinical isolates of H. pylori with MICs ranging from 5 to 50 \u03bcg/mL. The gingerols, another phynylpropanoids from Zingiber officinalis (zinger), possess antifungal and antibacterial properties (Park et al. 2008). Ginger extract containing gingerol inhibited the growth of H. pylori with MICs ranging from 0.8 to 12.5 \u03bcg/mL (Mahady et al. 2003).",

For example, anise oil had higher antifungal activity at pH 4.8 than at 6.8, while the oil of Cedrus deudorawas was most active at pH 9 (Janssen et al. 1987). The structure and stereochemistry of the essential oils have profound influences on the antimicrobial activities. Alkenyl substituents incorporated into nonphenolic ring structures of essential oils such limonene showed increased antibacterial activities compared with alkyl substituents such as p-cymene with alkylation showing more inhibitory effect on Gram-negative bacteria (Dorman and Deans 2000). From stereochemistry of EO, it has been reported that \u03b1-isomers such as \u03b1-pinene are less active relative to \u03b2-isomers such as geraniol and nerol; cis-isomers are inactive contrary to trans-isomers; compounds with methyl-isopropyl cyclohexane rings are the most active; or unsaturation of the cyclohexane ring further increases the antibacterial activity, e.g. terpinolene, terpineol and terpineolene (Hinou et al. 1989; Dorman and Deans 2000). However, Griffin et al. (1999) reported that the specificity and level of antimicrobial activity of terpenoids were not always characterized by the functional groups, but were associated with hydrogen-bonding parameters, and for Gram-negative organisms a com\u00adbination of hydrogen-bonding parameters and molecular size parameters. The antimicrobial properties of EO from different sources have been discussed in details elsewhere (10.1007/_5).",

Rahman et al. (2009) tested two limonoids isolated from the seeds of Swietenia mahagoni (Meliaceae family), swietenolide and 2-hydroxy-3-O-tigloylswietenolide against various multiple-drug-resistant bacterial strains including Gram-positive (S. aureus\n, S. pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae) and Gram-negative (E. coli\n, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella\ntyphi, and Salmonella paratyphi) strains. The most potent activity of swietenolide was observed against H. influenzae, S. typhi, and S. paratyphi, whereas 2-hydroxy-3-O-tigloylswietenolide was most active against S. pneumoniae, S. typhi, and S. paratyphi. The lowest activity was observed against K. pneumoniae for both compounds. The limonoids compounds may exhibit antibacterial properties against pathogenic bacteria by disrupting the quorum sensing system and biofilm production. Vikram et al. (2010) demonstrated limonin, nomilin, obacunone, deacetyl nomilin and limonin 17-O-\u03b2-D-glucopyranoside purified from seeds of grapefruits to possess the anti-quorum sensing activity and inhibitory effect on biofilm formation of pathogenic E. coli O157:H7 with obacunone exhibiting strong antagonistic activity.",

For example, the application of dual combinations demonstrated synergy between streptomycin and gallic acid, ferulic acid, chlorogenic acid, allylisothiocyanate and 2-phenyle\u00adthyliso\u00adthiocyanate against the Gram-negative bacteria. Moreover, they can act synergistically with less efficient antibiotics to control bacterial growth (Saavedra et al. 2010). 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid and 3-hydroxyphenylacetic acid increased the susceptibility of S. enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium strains for novobiocin. In addition, organic acids present in berries, such as malic acid, sorbic acid, and benzoic acid, were shown to be efficient permeabilizers of Salmonella as shown by an increase in the 1-N-phenylnaphthylamine uptake assay and by lipopolrsaccharide release (Alakomi et al. 2007). Cinnamon essential oil and its major component (trans-cinnamaldehyde) enhanced the antibacterial activity of clindamycin against a toxicogenic strain of Clostridium difficile (Shahverdi et al. 2007). In addition, the enhancement activity of different essential oils (Mentha longifolia L. and Mentha spicata L.) and different monoterpenes (piperitone, carvone and menthone) on the antibacterial activity of nitrofurantoin has been reported (Rafii and Shahverdi 2007; Shahverdi et al. 2004). The antibacterial activity of cefixime, cephotaxime, vancomycin and tetracycline was also increased by curcumin (Moghaddam et al. 2009). Allicin has a synergistic effect with amphotericin B against C. albicans via enhancing the phospholipid peroxidation reaction in vitro and in vivo, which suggests that allicin could reduce the amphotericin B dose to lessen side effects (An et al. 2009). Due to the growing use of phytochemicals and other dietary phytochemical-rich supplements, it is required to understand whether problems might arise from using these preparations in combination with conventional drugs. There is lack of comprehensive studies that can establish the consequences of phytochemicals-drug interactions. However, all these evidence also suggest that intake of phytochemicals rich foods could be considered in future research while antimicrobial agents are applied to the body.",

            "text": "Plant genomes contain 20,000\u201360,000 genes, and about 15\u201325% of these genes encode enzymes for secondary metabolism (Bevan et al. 1998; Somerville and Somerville 1999). The genome of a plant species encodes only a small fraction of all the enzymes that are required to synthesize the entire set of secondary metabolites found throughout the plant kingdom (Pichersky and Gang 2000). Identification of particular genes for target phytochemicals and the genetic engineering techniques could allow expressing the biosynthetic pathways of some phytochemical synthesis in organisms such as E. coli, B. subtilis or S. cerevisiae. For example, Miyahisa et al. (2006) reported that introduction of four genes for a phenylalanine ammonia-lyase, cinnamate/coumarate:CoA ligase, chalcone synthase, and chalcone isomerase, in addition to the acetyl-CoA carboxylase, in E. coli cells resulted in efficient production of (2S)-naringenin from tyrosine and (2S)-pinocembrin from phenylalanine. Finally, the possibility of using phytochemicals as antimicrobial compounds would be a paradigm shift towards the potential health benefits and safety overcoming the problem of microbial resistance to drugs.",
