Ethical dilemmas known to the specialty arise from the decisions to be made between what can be done and what should be done for varieties of cardiovascular pathologies. Some of the ethical deliberations are resurrection of a patient with acute coronary syndrome or malignant arrhythmias.1 The practice of cardiology is increasingly constrained by guidelines, regulations, and legal considerations.2 All doctors, including cardiologists, have a primary duty of care to individual patients, in addition to their responsibilities to society, institutions, and colleagues. Among cardiologists, the propensity to test and treat is closely associated with fear of malpractice suits.3\n",

Other limitations are nonapplicability for public health policies, access to a patient\u2019s personal information by third parties, and duress or constraints experienced by patients.",

Training on descriptive bioethics96 using various modern medical education technologies and discussion with fellow doctors, hospital administrators, religious leaders, and social scientists in difficult situations, can help to make policy decisions amicable to the patient, family, and society. Achievements in medical practice and health care delivery depend on the status of the medical education system, the nature of medical manpower, economic resources, the health care system, and, importantly, medicolegal law. The quality of medical manpower and medical services are determined by policy, findings, regulatory mechanisms, professional organizations, direction from judiciary, and expectations and participation of the community.",

            "text": "A common difficulty in the current medical education system is that it fails to inculcate appropriate skills and competencies to recognize and tackle ethical issues among the learners. Although developing an ethics-based medical education system is a challenging task, we have to take initiatives to deal with a variety of issues.Prevention\nA.Knowledge in medicine and timely application in a given situation to assess the case at the bedside meticulously with empathy; analysis of clinical issues and challenges, and differentiating one from another with or without the help of laboratory data; application of appropriate specific and nonspecific measures to alleviate the symptoms or to treat cases with currently available guidelines; acceptance of limitations of knowledge and skills, resources, and constraints; arrangement for referral or consultation; provision of follow-up care, rehabilitation services, or welfare program depending on the case; proper documentation, adequate informed consent, continuous monitoring to strengthen physician\u2013patient relationship, patient satisfaction, and quality of life, thereby avoiding any conflicts or liability issues.B.The attitude of health care professionals toward the patients shall be:1.Receive them with care and concern2.Respond with empathy3.Realize the underlying clinical problem(s) and manage with appropriate measures4.Review the clinical course, therapeutic strategies, and outcome5.Revise the plan and management with shared decision6.Seek further help, if needed\nC.Cardiologists should be informed to establish the kind of actions, communication skills, and empathy that are required to build a stronger patient\u2013health care professional relationship, which improves prognosis, treatment efficacy, and therapeutic adhesion.97\nD.Cardiac report cards should be developed that incorporate an ethical framework, which can identify points of ethical concern for practitioners, patients, policymakers, and researchers98\nE.The integrity and behavior of an individual physician plays a major role in the prevention of liability cases. Professional associations play a major role in the regular monitoring process and for initiating self-regulation of professionals.F.Doctors involved in handling insured patients are encouraged to consult Booth, 2008,99 which has extensive information on prevention. Also, physicians are encouraged to familiarize themselves with local guidelines because policies and practices of health care insurers are extremely varied.G.The role of community participation and utilization of existing laws and regulations in India toward clinical trials have alerted the highest health care bodies in the country, such as the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MOHFW), Central Drugs Standards Control Organization (CDSCO), and policymakers, to introduce new regulations on compensation for injury and death occurring during drug trials.100\nH.The Clinical Establishment Act101 of India, if implemented, will improve the dignity of patients and ensure safe services.I.To overcome the legal issues, one has to follow ethics and maintain professionalism and team spirit at all times. Respect, dedication, sincerity, compassion, good communication skills, prudence, meticulous documentation, and acknowledging the limitations of one\u2019s abilities help avoid legal liability.J.In India, the Supreme Court included the health profession under the 1986 Consumer Protection Act (CPA) of India [Supreme Court judgment AIR 1995 SC 550, dated 13.11.1995. New Delhi, India]. As a result, doctors can be charged for medical negligence liability under CPA.102\nK.\nResponsibilities of the health care institutions: Health care institutions have to provide a written notice of their privacy policy to all those who seek medical care for the first time. Patients must be informed of how the institution may use and disclose information. The written notice must describe patient\u2019s rights, including the right to access their medical information and their right to provide feedback or complaint, if they believe their rights were violated. The notice shall be in plain language and presented in an understandable manner. An acknowledgment of receipt of the information notice must be obtained from the patient.103 The institution shall have a close working relationship among medical personnel, legal, and risk management team. The team, through interaction on case by case basis, can acquire a wealth of information, learn, and meet the needs of clinical dilemma, which are evolving constantly. Such interactions enhance health care and ensure patient safety, and thereby establish a high standard of care. Also, the institution shall ensure quality assurance, organize risk management programs, and conduct routine audits or monitoring as suggested by a specialist\u2019s team. Laws generally require that therapeutic interventions be done in a reasonable and medically approved manner, preferably based on clinical evidence or standard guidelines. Medical staff dealing with cases should remember that the issues raised by any one case are complex and application in a real situation is difficult. Hence, staff should review the hospital counsel and the local laws and regulations pertaining to these issues.103\nL.\nMedical records: Medical personnel should be trained and motivated for proper documentation, adherence to risk management principles, and entry of every aspect related to the case in the respective medical record. The physician is required to write a medical record that will support the basis for the appropriate medical judgment made. The medical record should reveal supporting clinical data or facts, the patient\u2019s history available at that time, hemodynamic status, physical examination, investigation reports, and treatment plans administered. One must remember that hospital records are prima facie evidence.104 Therefore physicians who do not record supporting clinical data and history deprive themselves of a strong \u201cmedical judgment defense.\u201d103 Moreover, inappropriate entries or markings on the medical record can weaken the defense in a liability case.104\nIf any corrections are required in the medical record, the preferable method is to draw a single line over the word or value to be changed; and at the place where such correction is made, initials or signature should be affixed. However, total obliteration of a number or word may indicate that obliteration was done intentionally. Quality-assurance reviews of records of EDs often reveal inadequate charting by physicians and nurses.103 A lapse of documentation of patient\u2019s clinical condition for 4 hours or more after initial physician and nursing assessment will be utilized by the plaintiffs attorney in a lawsuit to develop the theory that no care was given. The uncooperative acts of the patient and the difficulties encountered in providing care to the patient because of his or her actions should be recorded. Poorly written physicians\u2019 notes may become an issue in a medical malpractice action and considered a less-than-caring attitude by the doctor. Descriptions of a patient\u2019s behavior and lifestyles should depict compassion and a professional manner. Health care institutions and cardiovascular physicians should realize consumer rights and responsibilities such as information disclosure, choice of providers and plans, access to emergency services, participation in a treatment discussion, respect and nondiscrimination, confidentiality of health information, and complaints and appeals.83\nM.\nIncentives and ethics: Incentives, in different forms, have been introduced for various services and are not accessible in health care delivery.105 Incentive mechanisms are based on four types of motives: traditional, self-interest, affective, and shared purposes. Financial incentives have helped to achieve the quality or efficiency of related targets but have potential adverse consequences including conflicts of interest that threaten patient\u2013physician trust. The ethical allegations, implications for effectiveness, and mechanisms of different motives were highlighted. Incentive schemes based on a robust sense of shared purposes protect and promote physicians\u2019 sense of moral responsibilities and ethical standards. These also enable physicians to take ownership of it rather than make them feel it is imposed on them.105\nN.\nPatient-centered specialty practice: As a part of a new phase of health care delivery systems, the National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) launched patient-centered specialty practice (PCSP) in 2013. The objectives of the committee are to reinforce care coordination, improve access to specialty care, reduce the use of unnecessary or duplicate tests, enhance communication, and assess and improve performance.106\nO.Provision of safe prescriptions is already included in the curriculum of health sciences. However, prescription errors remain a significant cause of patient harm. Lum et al.107 identified 12 core competencies for safe prescribing and listed them under 4 stages: information-gathering, decision making, communication and decisions, and monitoring and review.\u2022Overall, medical students and physicians should be trained and motivated to maintain:\u2022Physician\u2013patient relationship on all aspects of patient care\u2022Holistic approach\u2022Empathy\u2022Respect for patient autonomy\u2022Involvement of patients or, where appropriate, family members or caregivers as partners in therapeutic and management decisions\u2022Respect for patient culture, values, views, and beliefs or religious sentiments\u2022Consideration of patient\u2019s views on the use of alternative treatment options\u2022Nonjudgmental attitude in all aspects of work\u2022Engagement in reflective practice\u2022Clinical audit\n\nDelay in diagnostic investigations, the nonavailability of interventional procedures, recurrent and repeated system failures, and so on, are real aspects of all our daily lives, yet rarely are considered in mitigation. Careful documentation of these failures is paramount, if we need to defend ourselves against a system that seeks criminal prosecution or compensation. A legal decision for violation of ethics may lead to loss of status, career, and livelihood.\n\n",

To improve the quality of the physician\u2013patient encounter, we need to develop formal and informal curricula at medical institutions on communication skills and ethics.Key Learning Points\n\u2022Illness remains universal; however, human expectations and experience may vary personally and geographically.\n\u2022Principles of ethics and legal aspects have to be incorporated into health science education and discussed at every stage of clinical teaching.\u2022Ethics and legal aspects related to emerging areas of health care, such as medical tourism, ubiquitous health care, consumer-driven health care, integration of complementary therapy, and so on, need to be addressed.\u2022Curriculum about medical ethics should be included in all aspects of medical education and training, including continuing education. Such measures should reduce the possibilities of medical liability cases.\n\n",
