Healthy monocytes preconditioned with uremic serum reflected the same expressional regulation of ACE/ACE2, MAS and AngII receptors as those observed in HD and CKD stage 3-5 leukocytes. Overexpression of monocytic ACE dramatically decreased levels of ACE2 and induced a pro-atherogenic phenotype, partly reversed by AngII-modifying treatments, leading to an increase in ACE2. Overexpression of ACE2 in monocytes led to reduced endothelial adhesion, transmigration and downregulation of adhesion-related molecules.

Recently, Chon et al. [26] studied nondialyzed CKD patients and found that despite a relevant antihypertensive effect, angiotensin blockade did not consistently affect AT1R leukocytic expression. The authors postulated that factors involved in uremia are more dominant modulators of leukocytic AT1R expression in these patients. In contrast to these findings, therapy with AngII receptor blockers in our HD patients led to some degree of reduction of leukocytic AT1R and AT2R expression.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 206, "end": 210, "text": "[25]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 309, "end": 313, "text": "[26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 592, "end": 596, "text": "[26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 782, "end": 786, "text": "[26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 787, "end": 791, "text": "[27]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 792, "end": 796, "text": "[28]", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 821, "end": 825, "text": "[26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "D I S C U S S I O N"}, {"text": "Experimental overexpression of ACE on monocytes leads to downregulation of ACE2. This effect is most likely transmitted via formation of AngII and ligation of the AT1R, since it can be inhibited by ACE inhibition, and in part by angiotensin receptor blockade.

The expression pattern found in dialysis patients is associated with enhanced expression of adhesion molecules ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 as well as the activating cytokine MCSF. In the transfection experiments, overexpression of ACE induces these molecules and the angiotensin receptor blocker losartan reverts the induction. In contrast, overexpression of ACE2 has the opposite effects, with downregulation of the adhesion-promoting molecules.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 319, "end": 323, "text": "[29]", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "D I S C U S S I O N"}, {"text": "These findings are in agreement with earlier data that suggested ACE and ACE2 to be a counterregulatory mechanism not only within the kidney, heart or astrocytes, but also within the circulating leukocytes [30] [31] [32] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 206, "end": 210, "text": "[30]", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 211, "end": 215, "text": "[31]", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 216, "end": 220, "text": "[32]", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "D I S C U S S I O N"}, {"text": "Our results allow speculation that the uremic milieu induces a specific dysregulation of ACE/ACE2 expression that is responsible for the formation of a pro-inflammatory and adhesive monocyte phenotype. This fits well with our earlier data showing high expression of ACE on monocytes in dialysis patients in association with subclinical atherosclerosis [5] or cardiovascular mortality [18] . In comparison with a healthy population with significantly lower leukocytic MASR and upregulated ACE2 levels, it seems that the uremic environment, and especially uremic toxins, may affect the proper function of a local ACE2-MASR axis as a counterregulatory mechanism. Uremic toxins are not only able to induce the vascular damage of CKD, but also may induce the components of the RAS [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] . Shimizu et al. [34] demonstrated that indoxyl sulphate (IS), one of the most representative uremic toxins, upregulated angiotensinogen (AGT) expression in proximal tubular cells. Sun et al. [35] reported that IS and p-cresol sulphate upregulated, in addition to elevated AGT expression, other reninangiotensin-aldosterone system components such as renin and AT1R. Studies by Vanholder et al. [36] and Pletinck et al. [37] showed clearly that pro-inflammatory effects triggered by protein-bound uremic toxins contribute to vascular damage and renal disease progression by stimulating crosstalk between leukocytes and the vessel wall. Our data cannot rule out an additional participation of the systemic RAS, particularly since Kovarik et al. [24] demonstrated elevated Ang1-7 levels in HD plasma that may strongly upregulate leukocytic MASR. It is also worth noting that human macrophages react to inflammatory stimuli such as LPS with increased MASR transcripts [38] . On the other hand, it has been reported that oral administration of IS to CKD rats led to decreased levels of MASR in proximal tubular cells [39] . Such a contrary expression as compared with increased MASR in uremic leukocytes could be explained by different roles of the Ang1-7-MASR axis in mesangial and tubular cells within the kidney and other cells such as circulating leukocytes.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 352, "end": 355, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 384, "end": 388, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 776, "end": 780, "text": "[33]", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 781, "end": 785, "text": "[34]", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 786, "end": 790, "text": "[35]", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 791, "end": 795, "text": "[36]", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 796, "end": 800, "text": "[37]", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 818, "end": 822, "text": "[34]", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 993, "end": 997, "text": "[35]", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 1195, "end": 1199, "text": "[36]", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 1220, "end": 1224, "text": "[37]", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 1544, "end": 1548, "text": "[24]", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 1765, "end": 1769, "text": "[38]", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 1913, "end": 1917, "text": "[39]", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "D I S C U S S I O N"}, {"text": "Recently, there has been emerging evidence that microRNAs may trigger the silencing of distinct transcripts and cause the development and/or progression of renal disease [40] .
