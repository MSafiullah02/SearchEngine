Proteinuria was observed in 60% of patients on the first day of admission, suggesting that they had renal injury before or at the moment of admission. Elevated levels of serum creatinine (SCr) (>104 \u03bcmol/l for men and >84 \u03bcmol/l for women) and blood urea nitrogen (>8 mmol/l) were observed in 22% and 31% patients, respectively, during treatment. Furthermore, 28% of patients gradually worsened and were diagnosed with AKI. The mortality of these patients was 5.3-times higher than those without AKI. A previous study including 536 patients with SARS-CoV in Hong Kong in 2003 showed that 36 patients developed AKI after viral infection after a median of 20 days and 33 (91.7%) of them died3. These results indicate that development of AKI in patients with COVID-19 might be a crucial negative prognostic factor for survival. Li and colleagues1 also showed that patients with severe COVID-19 are at increased risk of kidney impairment. The level of SCr in patients with severe COVID-19 was significantly higher than in those without severe disease (P < 0.001), whereas patients with mild COVID-19 had higher SCr levels than patients with non-COVID-19-associated pneumonia (P < 0.01). AKI requiring CRRT occurred in 7 of the 65 patients with severe disease, but in none of the other patients included in this study.",

Acute renal tubular damage (but not glomerular injury) was seen in all six patients and acute tubular necrosis, luminal brush border sloughing and vacuole degeneration were observed to varying degrees. Similar findings were also observed in autopsy kidney samples from patients with MERS-CoV infection4, which showed degeneration of the renal tubules, including ectasia changes and necrosis, sloughing, and loss of brush surface in the proximal tubular epithelial cells. These results suggest that the renal tubules are a common target of infection. As SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have similar pathogenicity, comprehensive analysis of kidney injury in patients with SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV should be undertaken to improve our understanding of the possible outcomes.",

One study in testis autopsy specimens obtained from six patients who died of SARS-CoV showed that this virus can induce orchitis6. Pathological results showed spermatogenic cell apoptosis, germ cell destruction, few or no spermatozoa in the seminiferous epithelium, thickened basement membrane and leukocyte infiltration in all six specimens. Thus, the testes could be affected by SARS-CoV-2. A recent study provides insights into impaired male gonadal function on SARS-CoV-2 infection2. This study showed that the testosterone to luteinizing hormone (T to LH) ratio in 81 patients with COVID-19 was dramatically decreased in comparison with 100 age-matched healthy counterparts (patients with COVID-19: 0.74; healthy men: 1.31, P < 0.0001). Serum T to LH ratio (as a predictor of male gonadal function) could be a potential marker of impairment of reproductive health by SARS-CoV-2 (ref.2).",
