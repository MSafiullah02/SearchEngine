            "text": "The two-step contagion model is a simple toy model for understanding pandemic outbreaks that occur in the real world. The model takes into account that a susceptible person either gets immediately infected or weakened when getting into contact with an infectious one. As the number of weakened people increases, they eventually can become infected in a short time period and a pandemic outbreak occurs. The time required to reach such a pandemic outbreak allows for intervention and is often called golden time. Understanding the size-dependence of the golden time is useful for controlling pandemic outbreak. Using an approach based on a nonlinear mapping, here we find that there exist two types of golden times in the two-step contagion model, which scale as O(N 1/3 ) and O(N \u03b6 ) with the system size N on Erd\u0151s-R\u00e9nyi networks, where the measured \u03b6 is slightly larger than 1/4. They are distinguished by the initial number of infected nodes, o(N ) and O(N ), respectively. While the exponent 1/3 of the N -dependence of the golden time is universal even in other models showing discontinuous transitions induced by cascading dynamics, the measured \u03b6 exponents are all close to 1/4 but show model-dependence. It remains open whether or not \u03b6 reduces to 1/4 in the asymptotically large-N limit. Our method can be applied to several models showing a hybrid percolation transition and gives insight into the origin of the two golden times.",

This slow period is called golden time as it allows for intervention, which is much more difficult after the disease becomes global. Modeling of epidemic spread with essential factors is necessary to control catastrophic outbreaks within this golden time. To this end, several epidemic models have been investigated on complex networks, for instance, the susceptible-infected-removed (SIR) model [2, 3] and the susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) model [4] . Analytical and numerical studies of those models revealed that a continuous phase transition occurs on Erd\u0151s-R\u00e9nyi (ER) random networks [5] . Thus, abrupt pandemic outbreaks on a macroscopic scale, which often occur in the real world, cannot be reproduced using those models.",

            "text": "Considerable effort has been devoted recently to construct mathematical models that exhibit a discontinuous epidemic transition at a finite transition point on complex networks. A natural way is to appropriately extend the conventional SIR and SIS models. For instance, an extended SIR model includes more than one infected state of different pathogens that are cooperatively activated in contagion: A person who is suffering from the flu can be more easily infected by pneumonia. This model is referred to as a cooperative contagion model [6, 7] . Similar instances include a two-step contagion * bkahng@snu.ac.kr process. A patient becomes weakened first and then becomes sick. This model is referred to as the susceptible-weakenedinfected-removed (SWIR) model [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] . In another instance of modified SIR models, a network evolves by rewiring links at a certain rate during the spread of contagion [16] . The rewiring takes into account the mobility of humans. Then, epidemic spread can be accelerated as the rewiring rate is increased, which can lead to a discontinuous transition representing the pandemic outbreak.",

Here we reconsider this problem and represent the pattern of disease transmission using a nonlinear mapping. We show that the linear and nonlinear terms of the nonlinear mapping separately behave well. The linear term is responsible for one-step contagion without weakened states and the nonlinear term describes the two step contagion, which includes weakened state. Thus, the previous result of N 1/3 for the golden time is consistent with the characteristic size of the giant cluster generated in the SIR model [19, 20] , thus it is verified within this new framework. Next, we consider another case, which is the main concern of this paper, in which an epidemic starts to spread from endemic multiple seeds of O(N ) on ER networks also at the epidemic threshold. In this case, long latent period appears not immediately but after some characteristic time. Thus fluctuations induced by the stochastic process of disease transmission in the early time heavily affect the behavior during the latent period, which changes the measured exponent \u03b6 to a value slightly larger than 1/4. We estimate this scaling behavior using the saddle-node bifurcation theory [21] and discuss the underlying mechanism.",

We show that when the cascade starts from a fixed number of multiple seeds O(N ), the golden times for both models also become proportional to N \u03b6 , where \u03b6 are estimated to be slightly larger than 1/4 within our simulation range and those values are different to each other, suggesting non-universal behavior. However, we cannot exclude the possibility \u03b6 = 1/4 in large-N limit. We shall discuss this point in Sec. IV. This paper is organized as follows: We first introduce the SWIR model and set up the evolution equation of the epidemic dynamics in Sec. II. Next, we derive a nonlinear mapping for the epidemic spread from a single seed in Sec. III A. We show that the roles of the linear and nonlinear terms are well separated. In Sec. III B, we derive a similar nonlinear mapping for the multiple-seed case, and show how the multiplicative feature of the fluctuations of epidemic spreading affects scaling of the golden time. In Sec. IV, we obtain the golden times of the multiple-seed case for k-core percolation and the threshold model and show that the numerical values of \u03b6 are slightly larger than 1/4. We also discuss the possibility of \u03b6 = 1/4 in the thermodynamic limit. In Sec. V, we discuss the origin of the puzzle in view of nonlinear dynamics theory. A summary is presented in Sec. VI.",

It proceeds in the form of a CB tree [17] , i.e., the mean branching ratio (u n+1 \u2212 u n )/(u n \u2212 u n\u22121 ) is almost unity, and the main contribution is that of the reaction S + I \u2192 2I . Thus, in the thermodynamic limit, u n always stays zero so that nonlinear terms in Eq. (18) do not appear. However, in finite systems, u n grows gradually and the nonlinear term (b \u2212 a)u 2 n becomes significant after a characteristic time n c (N ). It was argued in Ref. [19] that for the SIR model at the epidemic threshold, the maximum size of outbreaks is proportional to N 2/3 in the mean field limit. When u n grows up to O(N 2/3 ), the nonlinear terms in Eq. (14) suppresses further growth of the cluster, leading to a subcritical branching process. This means that the CB process driven by Eq. (14) persists up to O(N 1/3 ), because the fractal dimension of the CB tree is two. However, for the SWIR model, the coefficient of the nonlinear term Eq. (18) is positive, and the nonlinear term enhances further increase of removed nodes. The CB process turns into a supercritical process, leading to a pandemic outbreak. Accordingly, the golden time, the duration of the CB process, scales similarly as \u223cN 1/3 to that of the SIR model, which is what we observed in a previous work [14, 17] .",

Due to the universal mechanism, the golden time scales as N 1/3 in a universal way for those models. During that study, we found that numerical simulations for the CFoIN with large system sizes require long computational times and memory space, so that numerical results with limited ensemble average were not neat. Based on such experience, here we limit our interest on to the golden time problem with multiple seeds to k-core percolation [22] and the threshold model [34] besides the SWIR to check the universal behavior. We find that for both models, the exponent values of the golden time are also measured to be slightly larger than 1/4. We note that the SWIR model and the two models above can be regarded as special cases of generalized epidemic process [8, 35] with heterogeneous transmission probabilities.

We first construct a k-core subgraph from an ER random graph with mean degree z > z c . After that, we perform an avalanche process by removing randomly selected \u03c1 0 N nodes from the k-core subgraph simultaneously. This removal may cause additional successive deletion of nodes. The avalanche size is defined as the total number of removed nodes in the avalanche process, and the duration time of the avalanche is the number of pruning steps. The avalanche size is classified as finite or infinite according to the criterion: If it is finite, the k-core would still remains; if it is infinite, the k-core would collapse to zero. The avalanche size depends on z and \u03c1 0 . For sufficiently large z, there exists a critical density \u03c1 c such that an infinite avalanche can occur when \u03c1 0 > \u03c1 c in the thermodynamic limit. In Fig. 6 , we measure the mean cascade time step (golden time) n c of infinite avalanches at the transition point for different system sizes N . We also measure d 0 (n * ) \u22121/2 + , where d 0 (n * ) is the noise measured at n * = 60, at which a critical branching process starts. The definition of d 0 is presented in the Appendix. It was found that n c scales as N 0.2655\u00b10.003 and d 0 (n * ) \u22121/2 + scales as N 0.262\u00b10.007 . The distribution function of \u221a Nd 0 (n * ) is shown in Fig. 7 (a) for two different system sizes. Similar to the case of the SWIR model, d 0 (n * ) is distributed asymmetrically and the distribution becomes more symmetric for larger system sizes. The skewness S 3 of Q N (d 0 (n * )) is plotted as a function of the system size N in Fig. 7(b) . It shows a power-law decaying behavior. Those obtained facts lead to the measured exponent \u03b6 being larger than 1/4, supporting the numerical result.",

However, because the dynamics proceeds from n = 0 stochastically, noises are accumulated during the avalanche dynamic process. In this case, for a given network at n = 0, noises of d 0 obtained at n * do not form a regular Gaussian distribution but do an asymmetric distribution, and the observed scaling of n c is not N 1/4 .

Using this model, we obtained the scaling behavior of the golden time with respect to the system size. Using the local tree approximation, we set up a nonlinear dynamic equation in the form of saddle-node bifurcation that represents the cascade dynamics of two-step contagion. When the epidemic dynamics starts from a single infected node, we showed that the linear and the nonlinear terms of the nonlinear mapping play distinct their roles. In the early time regime, the linear term governs a critical branching (CB) process. The CB tree can be regarded as a critical cluster in percolation. However, in the late time regime, the nonlinear term causes an explosive spread of epidemic disease. The golden time is determined by the finite-size effect on the linear term, which scales as \u223cN \u03b6 with \u03b6 = 1/3. This scaling behavior is universal for cascade-induced dynamic models such as the threshold model, k-core percolation and the CFoIN.",

In this case, a long CB process does not appear from n = 0, but it does at some characteristic time n * . During the time until n * , clusters of ever infected nodes merge and form a cluster of size O(N ). The size fluctuates for different realizations. The fluctuations are induced by the stochastic process of disease transmission. We found that these fluctuations change the value of \u03b6 from 1/3 to about 0.252 for the multiple-seed case. Due to the multiplicative noise of disease spread, the size distribution of those clusters over different realizations becomes asymmetric with a long tail in its positive region. It seems that due to such non-Gaussianity the golden time scales as \u223cN \u03b6 with \u03b6 slightly larger than 1/4. However, this asymmetry decreases gradually in a power-law manner of the skewness function as the system size is increased. This leaves the possibility open that asymptotically the value of \u03b6 approaches 1/4. This problem could not be ultimately solved by our study. A very precise analysis of corrections to scaling would be needed for it, which was not possible in spite of our massive numerical efforts.",
