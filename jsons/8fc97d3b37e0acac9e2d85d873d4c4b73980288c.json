            "text": "Most respiratory tract infections are caused by viruses or bacteria with viruses causing the highest proportion of infections. The major causes of acute respiratory infections (ARI) in children are respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenzavirus (PIV), influenza virus (IFV), adenovirus (AdV), and human rhinoviruses (HRV). Human metapneumovirus (HMPV), human coronaviruses (HCoV) HKU1, NL63, 229E and hospitalized children is cost-effective. It is pivotal in directing active treatment early in the course of the illness following detection, reducing unnecessary antibiotic prescription, and limiting nosocomial transmission to high-risk patients (Adcock et al., 1997; Lanata et al., 2004; Osiowy, 1998; Woo et al., 1997) . In addition, assessment of the morbidity of specific etiological agents of ALRTIs identified using sensitive detection methods in hospitalized patients is important to determine agent-specific interventions such as vaccination against RSV (Lanata et al., 2004) . Extensive detection of infections will also expand our knowledge of the etiology of pneumonia and assist in determining which etiological agents should be considered for vaccine development (Rudan et al., 2008) . Recent developments in molecular diagnosis of respiratory viruses and the discovery of new viruses have renewed the interest in respiratory virus epidemiology. However, there is still a considerable deficiency in the diagnosis of viruses which cause ALRTI (Ieven, 2007) . Far too little attention has been paid to the epidemiology of respiratory viral infections in Malaysia. Therefore, in this study, the goal was to detect a panel of classical and newly discovered respiratory viruses including IFV, RSV, PIV, AdV, HMPV, HRV, HEV, HCoV, and HBoV which cause ALRTI in children below 5 years of age at Hospital Serdang. Both conventional methods including direct immunofluorescence assay, cell culture and shell vial culture and molecular diagnostic techniques including multiplex PCR and sequencing were used.",

The participants were children more than one-month-old and less than 5 years of age who were admitted to the hospital between June 16, and December 21, 2009 with the diagnosis of ALRTI. Patients with congenital or acquired immunosuppressive conditions, with conditions that posed a potential hazard in obtaining the nasopharyngeal samples (e.g. bleeding diathesis, severe respiratory compromise) as determined by the clinicians and children with incomplete data or inadequate samples were excluded from the study. All potential subjects (including careers of the patients) were briefed on the study before written informed consent was obtained by the pediatrician in-charge of the case. Approval from the following authorities was obtained prior to the start of the study: the Ministry of Heath Malaysia Research and Ethics Committee (MREC) (NMRR-09-161-638), the Medical Research Ethics Committee, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, UPM (UPM/FPSK/PADS/T7-MJKEtikaPer/F01 (JMPP FEP (9) 32)) and the Research Ethics Board of Hospital Serdang were obtained.

DFA was the first conventional method of detection of common respiratory viruses used to identify eight viruses including IFV A & B, PIVs 1-3, RSV, HMPV and HAdV. HRV, HEV, HCoVs, PIV4 and HBoV were excluded from immunological detection because of a lack of specific monoclonal antibodies. For each virus the pattern of immunofluorescent staining was specific and was used for confirmatory purposes. Eighty eight (53.9%) of the 165 NPA samples were DFA positive as follows: 67 (40.6%) for RSV, 9 (5.5%) for HMPV, 4 (2.4%) for HAdVs, 3 (1.8%) for IFV A and 6 (3.61%) for PIVs 1-3. Detection of RSV, HMPV, PIV1-3, IFV-A & B, HAdV in shell vial culture was attempted as the second stage of the conventional method on the remaining 76 DFA negative NPA samples. Seven additional viruses were detected and a total of 95 (57.6%) samples were virus positive by DFA followed by shell-vial culture. Therefore, this method was able to detect some viruses which were missed by DFA: 4 RSV and one case each for HAdV, HMPV and PIV2. For RSV, CPE was detected in 31 of 83 specimens representing a 37% recovery. Twenty-four samples positive for HAdVs were inoculated into HeLa and HEp-2 cell lines. Five of 24 samples (21%) showed characteristic CPE. Semi-confluent monolayers of HeLa and MRC-5 cell lines were used to isolate 26 of the 54 HRV positive samples detected using RT-PCR.",

Analysis of the PCR products showed that each multiplex method simultaneously detected all three control viruses included in each reaction as well as the internal control with the expected band sizes. In the presence of all primer sets in the multiplex reaction, no mispriming was observed in the positive and negative control tubes. The specificity of the MP/RT-PCR products was confirmed by nucleotide sequence analysis. Three multiplex RT-PCR (MP/RT-PCR 1-3) and subsequently 2 hemi-nested multiplex PCR (HNMP/PCR 1-2) were carried out on nucleic acids extracted from 165 clinical specimens. The specific products were clearly separated and identified on a 2.5% Seakem agarose gel, both for virus control and for clinical specimens. In total, 154 samples (93.3%) from the panel of 165 were virus positive and 11 (6.7%) specimens were virus negative using this method. Almost all viruses (97%) were detected in the first stage of the MP/RT-PCR1-3 assay. In the second stage six (6/183, 3%) additional viruses were detected by HNMP/PCR1-2. Using normal and nested PCR, of the 165 samples tested, 6 were found to be positive for HBoV and 24 (14.5%) for adenovirus. Of these positive samples, single infections were documented in one HBoV and three cases of HAdV infection. In total, 158 samples (95.8%) were positive for respiratory viruses using the molecular method while 7 (4.2%) were negative. GAPDH was successfully amplified from all of the NPA samples tested by PCR indicating that there were no PCR inhibitors in the reactions. Therefore, false negative results were excluded using this internal control.",

Regional determination of the epidemiology of specific viral infections will improve the treatment guidelines for doctors (Irmen and Kelleher, 2000) . The main goal of the current study was to detect a broad panel of respiratory viruses associated with hospitalized children with ALRTIs in Malaysia. We report a high prevalence of respiratory viruses in hospitalized children (Allander et al., 2007; Jartti et al., 2004; Jennings et al., 2004; Richard et al., 2008) . This was achieved using highly sensitive nested PCR which was applied to a broad spectrum of viruses. NPA samples from 158 (95.8%) patients were positive for single and/or multiple viruses. Single virus infections were detected in approximately two-thirds of the samples compared with almost one-third of samples which were found to contain multiple viruses. The performance of conventional diagnostic methods and molecular methods was also evaluated using the samples in this study. As reported in other studies (Coiras et al., 2004 (Coiras et al., , 2003 Freymuth et al., 2006; LaSala et al., 2007; Weinberg et al., 2004) we established that molecular methods were more sensitive than conventional methods for the detection of respiratory viruses in children hospitalized with ALRTIs. Many respiratory viruses including RSV-A, and B, IFV-A, PIV1, PIV2, PIV3, HMPV, HRV-A and C, HEV, HAdV, HBoV, and HCoV-OC43 were detected in the patients in this study. RSV was the most prevalent virus detected in 50% of samples. Previous publications have frequently identified RSV as the major viral pathogen associated with LRTI in children (Chan et al., 1999; Grimwood et al., 2008; Hall et al., 2009; Richard et al., 2008; Zamberi et al., 2003) . Our results provide further supporting evidence that RSV infection is a frequent cause of hospitalization among children in tropical and developing countries (Weber et al., 1998; WHO, 2009) . HRV was the second most prevalent virus and was detected in one-third of patients which is a similar infection rate to that reported in other studies (Chung et al., 2007; Kim and Hodinka, 1998; Lau et al., 2009; Linsuwanon et al., 2009; Miller et al., 2009 Miller et al., , 2007 Papadopoulos et al., 2002; Peltola et al., 2009) .",

The finding of the current study is also consistent with study by Nathan who found RV and HRV as the most detected virus associated with ALRTIs in a prospective study in Malaysia (Nathan et al., 2017) . Co-infections with other viruses were found in approximately 33% (18/54) of HRV infections. The high prevalence of HRV in this study suggests that virus testing should be routinely aq HAdV was the third (14.5%) most common virus detected in this study. Adenoviruses are responsible for 3.6-13% of all LRTIs occurring in infants and children (Chen et al., 2004; Jennings et al., 2004; John et al., 1991; Lee et al., 2010; Rocholl et al., 2004) . Our findings seem to be consistent with the detection rate of 14% among hospitalized children with ALRTIs in Argentina (Videla et al., 1999) . This high detection rate is especially important in developing countries with high prevalence of measles and malnutrition.",

In the current study, all of the multiple infections were diagnosed exclusively using PCR, which further supports the superiority of molecular methods over conventional methods (Rovida et al., 2005; van de Pol et al., 2006) . Evaluation of the relative importance of each coexisting agent may play an important role in understanding the etiopathogenesis of these viruses (Tsolia et al., 2004) . Identification of all infectious agents is especially important in high-risk immonocompromised patients for appropriate antiviral therapy (Leland and Ginocchio, 2007) . In this study, multiple viral infections were found in 28% of patients and were usually combinations of RSV with HAdV and/or HRV. The co-detection rate is similar to that found by Calvo (2010) (Calvo et al., 2010) continued presence of all of the surveyed viruses during the study period with no distinct seasonality. RSV and HAdV was the most commonly detected co-infection. The high proportion of HAdV co-infections (87.5%) with other viruses in this study is comparable with (89%) HAdV co-infection rates in a study by Calvo (2010) (Calvo et al., 2010) . The second most prevalent combination was RSV and HRV (24%). This combination has been reported as the most common coinfection in other studies (Chung et al., 2007; Papadopoulos et al., 2002; Paranhos-Baccal\u00e0 et al., 2008; Richard et al., 2008) . The high incidence of RSV and HRV co-infection can be explained by the substantial overlapping of the monthly distribution observed for these viruses during the study period (Paranhos-Baccal\u00e0 et al., 2008) . Quantification of the viruses in the samples may help to better understand the etiological role of each virus (Rovida et al., 2005) . A study of the clinical features is required to clarify the disease severity in mixed infections (Paranhos-Baccal\u00e0 et al., 2008) .",

Molecular methods increased the detection rate by up to 27% compared with conventional methods. The high detection rate of HRV confirmed its association with severe LRTI and hospitalization. Our study also demonstrated that HMPV and HBoV can be important causes of hospitalization of Malaysian children. Yearly variations in the incidence of respiratory viruses may influence their association with ALRTIs and therefore our six months study should be considered as a snapshot of viral ALRTIs in pediatric inpatients.",
