Additional details regarding the sampling strategy are described in Galea et al. (2008). We applied population\u2010based weights representative of the 2000 U.S. Census data for these counties (Bureau of the Census, 2000) to reflect demographic population estimates for the data analyzed in the current study. After the population weights were applied, participants (52.2% women) reported their race as Caucasian (73.5%), African\u2010American (24.3%), Hispanic (1.1%), and Other non\u2010Hispanic (2.1%). Participants\u2019 ages ranged from 18 to 91 years (M = 46.47, SD = 17.88). Trained interviewers (supervised by Ph.D.\u2010level clinicians) used a computer\u2010assisted interviewing system to administer a battery of self\u2010report questionnaires 18 to 24 months after the hurricane to assess participants\u2019 current experiences, as well as to gather and assess retrospective self\u2010reports of experiences before and immediately after the hurricane. Interviews included the Composite International Diagnostic Interview for DSM\u2010IV (CIDI), a structured interview used to assess psychiatric disorders that is commonly used in epidemiological studies (Kessler & Utsun, 2004). Previous studies that examined diagnoses in this same sample found that approximately 16% of participants met PTSD diagnostic criteria (Galea, Tracy, Norris, & Coffey, 2008) and 12% met MDD criteria (Nillni et al., 2013) since Hurricane Katrina. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of Michigan and all participants provided verbal consent.",

Consistent with the assumptions of linear regression (Tueller, Keboec, & Van Dorn, 2016), the outcome variables were normally distributed as indicated by acceptable estimates of skewness (range: 0.23\u20131.05) and kurtosis (range: \u22121.26\u20130.38; Kim, 2013). In the analyses, number of Hurricane Katrina\u2013related traumatic events was the independent variable (X), perceived social support was the first moderating variable (M1), displacement was the second moderating variable (M2), and cluster\u2010specific PTSD symptoms (analyzed separately by cluster) and depressive symptoms were the dependent variables (Y). The independent variable and both moderators were grand\u2010mean centered prior to computing interaction terms, including a three\u2010way interaction (i.e., Katrina\u2010related trauma * social support * displacement). In a series of exploratory analyses, we also investigated whether social support moderated the associations between trauma exposure and PTSD and depressive symptoms conditional on participant group membership, in line with our hypotheses that social support would demonstrate buffering effects only for nondisplaced participants. Age and minority status were correlated with outcome variables (see Table 1); therefore, both were included as covariates. Minority status was coded as White (0) and minority (1; participants who reported Hispanic ethnicity or African American, Native American, Asian, Pacific, Islander, or other race). Because the number of traumatic events experienced before Hurricane Katrina (i.e., trauma history) and current stressors related to the aftermath of the hurricane could influence current symptoms, we controlled for both variables to test for the unique effects of the number of Hurricane Katrina\u2013related traumatic events and social support (in the 2\u2010month period after hurricane) on current symptoms of PTSD and depression. The original data set consisted of 810 participants, and 99% of the cases were complete with no missing data. Five participants did not complete all measures, and were therefore excluded, leaving a total sample size of 805.",

Unlike previous studies, our findings highlight the unique, significant buffering effect of crisis\u2010related social support on depressive symptoms by controlling for highly correlated variables: number of previous traumatic events experienced and disaster\u2010related stressors. Lastly, unexpectedly, the significant buffering effect of social support did not differ between displaced and nondisplaced residents, which suggests that perceived social support is linked to important cognitive and behavioral processes that reduce the likelihood of developing depressive symptoms (e.g., challenging negative beliefs about self; Farnsworth & Sewell, 2011), and those effects are not limited to nondisplaced disaster survivors. Overall, these findings expand our understanding of the buffering role of social support on depressive symptoms following exposure to disaster\u2010related traumatic events, regardless of the displacement context in which it occurs.",

Our study expanded on previous findings showing that social support positively impacts total PTSD symptoms (La Greca et al., 2010; Pietrzak et al., 2010) by demonstrating similar results when we assessed PTSD symptom clusters separately. Further, these findings that highlight the positive impact of social support on a wide range of PTSD symptoms are an important contribution because most victims of Hurricane Katrina did not meet full criteria for PTSD (Galea et al., 2008), but still endorsed subthreshold symptoms and may be at risk for subsequent adverse health outcomes.",

These findings suggest that reexperiencing symptoms may not be amenable to the benefits of social support in the same manner as avoidance and arousal symptoms. One possible explanation is that social support may not directly affect the internal processes linked to the development and maintenance of reexperiencing symptoms (e.g., avoiding memories or thoughts about the event) in part because people willing to offer support may be less aware of the survivor's internal experiences, thus limiting their ability to offer support for those specific symptoms. Consistent with Joseph and colleagues\u2019 (1997) theory, social support may be more applicable to reducing avoidance symptoms because supporters could more easily facilitate increased engagement in activities and decreased isolation. Similarly, social support may buffer the development of arousal symptoms by encouraging or modeling emotion regulation skills. Further research is needed to better understand how specific mechanisms of social support impact the development of different PTSD symptom clusters.",

However, exploratory analyses suggested some differences between groups when predicting arousal and avoidance symptoms, which may warrant additional research in the future, using larger sample sizes. Namely, exposure to traumatic events did not predict arousal and avoidance symptoms 18 to 24 months after Hurricane Katrina for nondisplaced individuals who endorsed medium\u2010to\u2010high levels of crisis\u2010related social support, whereas there was no buffering effect for displaced residents. It should be noted that preliminary analyses indicated the two groups did not significantly differ in their mean levels of perceived social support. Because our assessment was limited to a brief self\u2010report measure of social support, it is unclear why there were no differences between groups. Although there is a need for further research to better understand what factors may influence perceived support (e.g., types of support or idiosyncratic beliefs), similar levels across both groups suggests the role of social support on cluster\u2010specific PTSD symptoms after a natural disaster could vary based on situational factors, specifically whether or not someone was displaced from his or her home. One possible explanation is that the type or quality of social support is different for displaced individuals, who may not have the same access to their typical social network and community (which might provide more meaningful support) as do nondisplaced individuals (i.e., differences in the helpfulness of their supporters), which may have been more likely to elicit buffering effects. This potential difference in the type of support may be especially important for reducing arousal symptoms if social support facilitates emotion regulation skills as previously described. Differences in avoidance symptoms could also be attributed to displaced individuals having greater opportunities to avoid external triggers, because they are not living in the same place where they experienced the disaster. Conversely, social support for nondisplaced residents may buffer the negative reinforcement of avoidance symptoms by encouraging individuals to engage with activities, people, and places in their community that remind them of the traumatic event. It follows that social support for displaced individuals might only have a direct effect on avoidance symptoms, consistent with previous studies (e.g., Pietrzak et al., 2010), rather than impacting the specific association between Hurricane Katrina\u2013related traumatic events and avoidance.",

These findings suggest the development of mental health outcomes could differ by displacement, and the role of social support may vary across mental health outcomes. In this study, discrepant results for cluster\u2010specific PTSD symptoms of displaced residents could be attributed to the unique experience of other stressors after the hurricane (e.g., unsanitary living conditions, stress of receiving government or insurance payments), which may have explained a larger portion of variance in the development and maintenance of PTSD symptoms compared to depressive symptoms. Future research should further examine differences in postdisaster stressors for displaced and nondisplaced residents to better understand how those differences uniquely impact PTSD symptom development.",

            "text": "There are several limitations to this study that should be noted. First, there was no baseline measurement of mental health symptoms or social support prior to the hurricane. This limitation is most relevant when considering the assessment of depressive symptoms, given that previous depressive and comorbid disorders could impact the experience of depressive symptoms following a traumatic event (Salcioglu, Basoglu, & Livanou, 2007). Although it is possible that preexisting mental health concerns could have increased the likelihood of developing PTSD symptoms, it is unlikely the measurement of PTSD symptoms in this study captured symptoms related to previous traumatic exposure, because the assessment was directly linked to current hurricane experiences, consistent with previous studies (e.g., \u201cDid you deliberately try not to think or talk about Hurricane Katrina?\u201d; Tracy et al., 2011). Also, there may have been differences in baseline social support or the availability of support within social networks, which could have influenced the amount of perceived support following the trauma itself. Future research seeking to understand the moderating effects of social support should consider stable measurements of social support and psychopathology prior to traumatic events, if possible, and examine the degree to which PTSD and depressive symptoms are influenced by both changes in availability and utilization of social support.",

All measures, except for current PTSD and depressive symptoms, were assessed retrospectively at 18 to 24 months following the hurricane and therefore could have been at risk for poor recall. For example, the recollection of social support experienced in the 2 months following the hurricane could have been influenced by current mental health concerns (e.g., depressive symptoms) or stressors; although, as previously described, there was a nonsignificant difference between displaced and nondisplaced groups. Additionally, the CSS demonstrated lower reliability, which could have decreased the likelihood of detecting significant interaction effects. Second, the measures used to assess depressive and PTSD symptoms were brief and administered by trained interviewers, which may have led to over\u2010 or underestimation of symptoms. Also, brief measures that did not assess severity of each symptom may not have fully captured the level of impairment in participants who did not clearly meet full diagnostic criteria. However, it should be noted the data collected were a part of a larger epidemiological study with considerations of participant time and burden that prohibited the use of more detailed, clinician\u2010rated assessments. Future studies would benefit from the assessment of PTSD symptom clusters and depressive symptoms in greater detail with consideration of the level of impairment associated with symptoms. Measurement of displacement status was also limited and did not include factors that could potentially influence distress associated with moving in the wake of a natural disaster. Future studies should incorporate a more detailed assessment of displacement factors such as voluntary or involuntary displacement, and immediate or delayed displacement.",

Although there are limited guidelines for determining adequate sample sizes for a three\u2010way interaction when including both continuous and dichotomous (i.e., displacement status) moderators, given the lower reliability of the CSS measure (Cronbach's \u03b1 = .73), this study may have been underpowered to detect such effects. Because three\u2010way interactions were nonsignificant, tests of whether the moderating effects of social support on the association between trauma exposure and PTSD and depressive symptoms were conditional on participant membership in the nondisplaced group were exploratory and must be interpreted with caution. However, given the unique nature of this population and the difficulties associated with collecting longitudinal data from people who are both displaced and psychologically impacted by a natural disaster (e.g., Norris, 2006), exploratory findings may still offer a significant contribution and highlight the need for additional research with larger sample sizes and highly reliable measures to better understand how displacement status and social support influence the development of mental health outcomes.",

Furthermore, exploratory findings suggested that when considering PTSD symptoms, the impact of social support might depend on whether a person is displaced after a natural disaster, whereas this is not the case for depressive symptoms. Overall, this study increases our understanding of when social support moderates mental health outcomes and offers implications for how it can be utilized in future disaster response efforts; namely, social support should be facilitated for all residents to alleviate depressive symptoms, but more resources are likely needed to buffer the effects of cluster\u2010specific PTSD symptoms in displaced populations.",
