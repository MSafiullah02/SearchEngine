            "text": "Many emerging and re\u2010emerging viral diseases in animals and humans pose significant global health problems for which novel antiviral measures are in urgent demand. In general, rational design of new prophylactic and curative antiviral strategies requires a detailed knowledge of the viral infection mechanism and the host's innate and adaptive immune defense. Historically, cell biological and microbiological research was mainly focussed on the nucleic acid and protein level. However, over the last few decades it has become clear that also glycans account to a great extent for the structural and functional diversity displayed by animal and human cells and their pathogens. At this moment, glycobiology is one of the most rapidly expanding disciplines in biology. A rapidly evolving array of powerful, novel techniques for the analysis of glycan structure and function (glycomics) has prompted many scientists to apply these tools to the field of virology, and this glycovirological approach has yielded a wealth of information on the various glycobiological aspects of viral infection and antiviral immunity. Particularly fascinating in this context are the many distinct glycan\u2010lectin interactions that may occur during viral infection of a host. Virion\u2010associated glycans often serve as ligands for specific host lectins. Conversely, the glycan portions of host glycoconjugates function as receptors for various viruses that employ viral lectins for host cell entry. This review reflects on glycan\u2013lectin interactions in the context of viral infection and antiviral immunity. Following a general introduction on glycan and lectin biology, specific glycan\u2013lectin interactions are highlighted and discussed within the larger framework of viral infection and immunity. Distinction is made between interactions that benefit the host and interactions that benefit the virus. In addition, different factors that contribute to glycan and lectin variation \u2013 and that consequently affect glycan\u2013lectin interactions \u2013 are explored and various approaches to modulate specific glycan\u2013lectin interactions in antiviral therapies are briefly discussed.",

The term \u2018glycan\u2019 refers to the carbohydrate portion of glycoproteins and glycolipids typically found at cell surfaces, in extracellular matrices and in cell secretions. Unlike nucleic acid and protein synthesis, the biosynthesis of glycans is not a template\u2010driven process. Instead, glycosylation depends on the concerted action of different glycosyltransferase, glycosidase, and other enzymes. Several important glycan types are exclusively assembled by the enzyme sets present in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the Golgi network: glycan/glycoconjugate synthesis is typically initiated in the ER or early Golgi and gradual processing and diversification \u2013 or \u2018maturation\u2019 \u2013 occurs as these molecules move further through the different enzyme\u2010equipped compartments of the secretory pathway. The variability inherent to glycan synthesis and maturation forms the basis of the considerable diversity and complexity of the glycan repertoires found on animal glycoconjugates (Varki et al., 2009; Taylor & Drickamer, 2011).",

            "text": "According to the basic glycan \u2018core\u2019 structure, the type of molecule the glycans are linked with and the type of the linkage, glycans and glycoconjugates can be categorized in different classes. Two major classes of protein\u2010linked glycosylation are the N\u2010 and O\u2010linked glycans. N\u2010linked glycans are covalently linked to the nitrogen atoms of specific amino acid (aa) residues (typically Asparagine) via an N\u2010glycosidic bond. N\u2010acetylglucosamine\u2013to\u2013Asparagine (GlcNAc\u03b2\u2010Asn) type glycans represent the most common form of N\u2010linked protein glycosylation (Weerapana & Imperiali, 2006; Varki et al., 2009; Larkin & Imperiali, 2011; Schwarz & Aebi, 2011; Taylor & Drickamer, 2011). O\u2010linked glycans are covalently attached to the oxygen atoms of specific amino acid residues (typically Serine or Threonine) via an O\u2010glycosidic bond. A common O\u2010glycan type \u2013 and potentially the one most studied \u2013 is the N\u2010acetylgalactosamine\u2013to\u2013Serine/Threonine (GalNAc\u03b1\u2010Ser/Thr) type or mucin\u2010type O\u2010glycan. Other (nonmucin) O\u2010glycan types include \u03b1\u2010linked O\u2010mannose, \u03b1\u2010linked O\u2010fucose, \u03b2\u2010linked O\u2010xylose, \u03b2\u2010linked O\u2010GlcNAc (N\u2010acetylglucosamine), \u03b1\u2010/\u03b2\u2010linked O\u2010galactose, and \u03b1\u2010/\u03b2\u2010linked O\u2010glucose glycans (Van den Steen et al., 1998; Peter\u2010Katalinic, 2005; Varki et al., 2009; Jensen et al., 2010; Gill et al., 2011; Taylor & Drickamer, 2011). Interestingly, various proteins are also modified with glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), linear polysaccharide chains composed of repeated disaccharide subunits consisting of a uronic acid/galactose residue and an amino sugar. Glycosaminoglycan\u2010carrying glycoproteins are generally referred to as proteoglycans (Prydz & Dalen, 2000; Varki et al., 2009; Taylor & Drickamer, 2011). Figure 1 illustrates the general structure and classification of some common types of protein glycosylation. Similarly as for protein\u2010linked glycosylation, different types of lipid\u2010linked glycosylation can be discerned: the glycosphingolipids (Varki et al., 2009; Taylor & Drickamer, 2011; Yu et al., 2011) and the glycophospholipid anchors or glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors (Paulick & Bertozzi, 2008; Varki et al., 2009; Taylor & Drickamer, 2011) represent important glycolipid classes. Their basic structure is introduced in Fig. 2.",

Common (sub)terminal modifications include poly\u2010N\u2010acetyllactosamine chains, ABH and Lewis histo\u2010blood group antigens (HBGA), and sialic acids in different linkages (Varki et al., 2009; Taylor & Drickamer, 2011).

This is most obvious in the case of obligatory intracellular pathogens such as viruses. Glycans form an important part of the surface of many viruses. As the glycosylation of viral components is facilitated by the cellular glycosylation machinery, viral glycosylation is similar to that of the host. However, important differences have been noted: Viral glycoproteins are often more heavily glycosylated than their cellular counterparts and the composition of individual glycan chains can diverge greatly between virus and host. The biological basis of this variability is further situated later in this review (see \u2018Glycan and lectin variation at the virus level\u2019).",

Alternatively, glycans can also have nonstructural roles and take part in specific recognition events, in which they usually interact with complementary glycan\u2010binding proteins called lectins (Varki et al., 2009; Taylor & Drickamer, 2011).",

According to the more strict definitions, glycosaminoglycan\u2010binding proteins and lectins are distinguished based on different factors, including their ligand range, the structural basis of their glycan recognition, and their conservation (Varki et al., 2009). In general, glycosaminoglycan\u2010binding proteins interact with negatively charged glycosaminoglycans via clusters of positively charged aa residues and \u2013 with exception of hyaluronan\u2010binding proteins, which seem to share an evolutionarily conserved fold \u2013 do not appear to be evolutionarily related to each other (Varki et al., 2009). In contrast, most strict sense lectins belong to protein families with defined \u2018carbohydrate recognition domains\u2019 (CRD). The CRDs within a lectin family share structural and functional properties and selectively recognize specific portions of N\u2010glycans, O\u2010glycans, or glycolipids (sometimes also glycosaminoglycans) (Varki et al., 2009). Although some CRDs can efficiently bind monosaccharides, other CRDs show no apparent affinity for monosaccharides and favor oligosaccharide ligands. The latter CRD type often has a preference for ligands with specific linkages between the monosaccharide subunits, as these linkages determine the 3D structure of the glycan ligand and therefore the portions of the glycan that are available for interaction with the CRD.",

Whereas some lectins contain multiple CRDs that can participate in ligand binding, others contain only a single CRD and rely on clustering of individual lectin molecules for high avidity binding. Clustering of CRDs does not only allow stronger interactions with ligands, but also contributes to the specificity/selectivity of interactions at the multivalent level. The relative spacing of the CRDs allows highly avid, multivalent binding to specific saccharide ligands in a certain density and particular presentation. Ultimately, the avidity of lectins for specific glycoconjugates depends on the structure, multivalency, and density of glycans on these molecules (Elgavish & Shaanan, 1997; Weis, 1997; Loris, 2002; Varki et al., 2009; Gabius et al., 2011).",

They are involved in many different biological processes, including glycoprotein trafficking, cell adhesion and signaling, and their expression is usually tightly regulated (Varki et al., 2009). Particularly striking is the great number of membrane\u2010associated and soluble lectins that are linked with host immunity. Immune system lectins are involved in intercellular communication, positive and/or negative regulation of activation, regulation of inflammation, disposal of damaged and apoptotic cells, etc. Several of these lectins have also been identified as \u2018pattern recognition receptors\u2019 (PRRs), which act as molecular sensors for pathogens and endogenous stress signals and often trigger specific immune reactions/mechanisms in response to their detection (Gordon, 2002; Janeway & Medzhitov, 2002; Cambi & Figdor, 2003; McGreal et al., 2004; Cambi et al., 2005; McGreal et al., 2005; Crocker et al., 2007; Crocker & Redelinghuys, 2008; van Kooyk & Rabinovich, 2008; Garcia\u2010Vallejo & van Kooyk, 2009; Geijtenbeek & Gringhuis, 2009; Sato et al., 2009; Bottazzi et al., 2010; Dam & Brewer, 2010; Kumagai & Akira, 2010; Svajger et al., 2010; Davicino et al., 2011; Osorio & Reis e Sousa, 2011; Sancho & Reis e Sousa, 2012).

Alternatively, pathogens attached to such cell surface lectins may also be directly presented to neighboring immune cells in trans, a process that seems especially significant at sites with a high density of immune cells (e.g. the lymph nodes).

Studies using distinct IAV isolates indicate that SP\u2010D and MBL bind mannose\u2010rich glycans on the viral surface glycoproteins hemagglutinin and neuraminidase (a viral lectin and a viral glycosidase, involved in IAV entry and release; see discussion on viral lectins) through their CRDs (Malhotra et al., 1994; Reading et al., 1997; Kase et al., 1999; Hartshorn et al., 2000; Hillaire et al., 2011). Although SP\u2010A may interact with some IAV isolates in a similar manner (Malhotra et al., 1994), binding of this molecule to most of the IAV variants tested to date appears not to involve the lectin activity of SP\u2010A; in contrast, virus binding depends on the interaction of the viral hemagglutinin with a sialylated N\u2010glycan on the SP\u2010A CRD (Hartshorn et al., 1994; Benne et al., 1995, 1997; Hartshorn et al., 1997; van Eijk et al., 2003; Mikerov et al., 2008). In other words: SP\u2010D and MBL binding depend on viral glycosylation, whereas SP\u2010A binding mainly depends on the specificity of the hemagglutinin, and this is mirrored in the spectrum of IAV variants these lectins can effectively bind (Hartshorn et al., 1994; Malhotra et al., 1994; Benne et al., 1995, 1997; Hartshorn et al., 1997; Reading et al., 1997; Kase et al., 1999; Hartshorn et al., 2000; van Eijk et al., 2003; Mikerov et al., 2008; Hillaire et al., 2011). Interestingly, the porcine variant of SP\u2010D appears to combine the above\u2010mentioned IAV\u2010binding functionalities: this molecule may not only bind IAV virions through interaction of its CRD with high mannose glycans on the virion surface (similar to other SP\u2010D molecules), but also through interaction of a sialylated glycan on the lateral surface of its CRD with the IAV hemagglutinin (similar to SP\u2010A) and can therefore bind to a broader array of IAV variants (van Eijk et al., 2002, 2003, 2004; Hillaire et al., 2011).",

            "text": "\nIn vitro assays show that SP\u2010A and SP\u2010D can directly neutralize IAV infectivity (Benne et al., 1995; Reading et al., 1997; Hartshorn et al., 2000; van Eijk et al., 2003; Hawgood et al., 2004; Hillaire et al., 2011). Both SP\u2010A and SP\u2010D inhibit the viral hemagglutinating activity that is required for IAV attachment to target cells (Hartshorn et al., 1994; Malhotra et al., 1994; Benne et al., 1995; Hartshorn et al., 1996, 1997, 2000; van Eijk et al., 2002, 2003, 2004; Mikerov et al., 2008; Hillaire et al., 2011) and SP\u2010D was reported to inhibit the viral neuraminidase (Reading et al., 1997; Hillaire et al., 2011). Interestingly, both lectins also induce viral aggregation (Hartshorn et al., 1994, 1996, 1997; van Eijk et al., 2003) and function as potent opsonins. SP\u2010A for instance was identified as an opsonin for IAV phagocytosis by alveolar macrophages (Benne et al., 1997). Moreover, SP\u2010A and SP\u2010D were shown to enhance IAV binding to neutrophils (Hartshorn et al., 1994, 1996, 1997; van Eijk et al., 2003) and SP\u2010D\u2010IAV complexes were found to internalize upon attachment to neutrophils (Hartshorn et al., 1997; van Eijk et al., 2003). Pre\u2010incubation of IAV with SP\u2010A or SP\u2010D also enhances the virus\u2010induced H2O2 responses in neutrophils (Hartshorn et al., 1994, 1996, 1997; van Eijk et al., 2003) and pre\u2010incubation of the virus with SP\u2010D can protect neutrophils from IAV\u2010induced deactivation (Hartshorn et al., 1994, 1996, 1997). MBL can counteract IAV by roughly the same mechanisms as SP\u2010D (Hartshorn et al., 1993; Anders et al., 1994; Malhotra et al., 1994; Hartshorn et al., 1996, 1997; Reading et al., 1997; Kase et al., 1999), although its ability to activate the complement cascade expands its capabilities (Anders et al., 1994; Reading et al., 1995; Chang et al., 2010). Ligand binding by MBL (or alternatively ficolins) can lead to activation of MBL\u2010associated serine proteases (MASPs) and initiate the complement cascade via the so\u2010called lectin pathway (Blue et al., 2004; Bottazzi et al., 2010). Complement deposition on a virus may interfere directly with crucial steps in the viral infection process (e.g. receptor binding), but can also trigger complement receptor\u2010mediated uptake of the pathogen into immune cells. In addition, for enveloped viruses, complement activation may result in membrane attack complex (MAC) formation on the viral envelope and subsequent virolysis (Blue et al., 2004; Bottazzi et al., 2010).",

NiV encodes two viral membrane glycoproteins \u2013 the attachment protein NiV\u2010G and the fusion protein NiV\u2010F \u2013 that mediate viral entry and direct the endothelial cell syncytia formation typically associated with NiV infection (Levroney et al., 2005; Garner et al., 2010; Lee & Ataman, 2011). Binding of NiV\u2010G to cell surface receptors induces a conformational change in NiV\u2010F, thereby activating its fusogenic activity (Levroney et al., 2005; Garner et al., 2010; Lee & Ataman, 2011). Galectin\u20101 associates with glycans on the NiV envelope proteins and interferes with the membrane fusion process in multiple ways (Levroney et al., 2005; Garner et al., 2010). Not only does galectin\u20101 binding directly inhibit the crucial conformational change in NiV\u2010F associated with membrane fusion, it also reduces the lateral mobility of NiV\u2010F and NiV\u2010G in the lipid membrane and consequently counteracts the physical separation of NiV\u2010F and NiV\u2010G that is essential for this conformation change (Garner et al., 2010). Moreover, galectin\u20101 binding impedes endocytosis and maturation of the NiV\u2010F precursor NiV\u2010F0 in infected cells (Garner et al., 2010), further illustrating the capacity of this lectin to block different stages of the viral infection/replication process.",

Viral association with glycosaminoglycans is usually attributed to charge\u2010based attractions between clusters of positively charged aa residues on the virion surface and the negatively charged glycosaminoglycan chains. The interaction with glycosaminoglycans often constitutes the first contact between a virus and its target cell and typically increases infection efficiency. However, it has been documented for several viruses that the ability to interact with glycosaminoglycans can result from adaptation to growth in cell culture (Sa\u2010Carvalho et al., 1997; Klimstra et al., 1998; Hulst et al., 2000; Mandl et al., 2001).

Similar to animal lectins, such virally encoded lectins often possess characteristic glycan binding regions (\u2018glycan binding pockets\u2019) and recognize specific portions of protein\u2010 and lipid\u2010linked glycans. The hemagglutinin protein of IAV is generally regarded as the prototype of a viral lectin. Hemagglutinin is a membrane glycoprotein that forms noncovalently linked homotrimers in the (viral) membrane and is responsible for both virus attachment and penetration (Skehel & Wiley, 2000; Harrison, 2008; Gamblin & Skehel, 2010). The mature hemagglutinin protein consists of two disulfide\u2010linked subunits, termed HA1 and HA2 (Skehel & Wiley, 2000; Harrison, 2008; Gamblin & Skehel, 2010). The HA1 subunit forms the globular \u2018head\u2019 region of hemagglutinin that covers the lectin function of this molecule: sialic acid\u2010binding pockets in the membrane distal part of HA1 allow interaction with sialic acid\u2010containing receptors on target cells (Skehel & Wiley, 2000; Harrison, 2008; Gamblin & Skehel, 2010). Variation in the HA1 subunit determines the affinity and specificity (e.g. \u03b12\u20103\u2010 vs. \u03b12\u20106\u2010linked sialic acids) of this molecule (Skehel & Wiley, 2000; Gamblin & Skehel, 2010). As seen for animal lectins, also hemagglutinin binds with its glycan counterparts with a relatively low affinity and efficient virus attachment and entry depends on the interaction of multiple hemagglutinin molecules with multiple sialic acid\u2010containing receptors (Skehel & Wiley, 2000; Gamblin & Skehel, 2010). The stalk\u2010like HA2 subunit of hemagglutinin mediates the pH\u2010dependent fusion process upon internalization of the IAV virion in the endosomal compartment of the target cell (Skehel & Wiley, 2000; Harrison, 2008; Gamblin & Skehel, 2010).",

Intriguingly, the best\u2010known examples in this context are again influenza viruses. As situated above, both influenza A and B viruses display hemagglutinin proteins on their surface, which bind to sialic acids displayed on the host cell surface and mediate pH\u2010dependent fusion of the viral membrane with the host cell membrane (Skehel & Wiley, 2000; Lamb & Krug, 2001; Wang et al., 2007b; Wang et al., 2008a; Harrison, 2008; Gamblin & Skehel, 2010). An RDE activity was mapped to another viral membrane glycoprotein, designated neuraminidase (Gottschalk, 1957; Colman, 1994; Lamb & Krug, 2001; Gamblin & Skehel, 2010). This enzyme removes sialic acid moieties from glycoproteins and glycolipids by catalyzing the hydrolysis of the \u03b1\u2010ketosidic linkage to the subterminal sugar residue and consequently destroys potential receptors for the viral hemagglutinin (Gottschalk, 1957; Colman, 1994; Lamb & Krug, 2001; Gamblin & Skehel, 2010). Viral use of an enzyme that can actually destroy receptors for the virus may seem peculiar at first. Importantly, however, the neuraminidase activity can prevent virions from aggregating via hemagglutinin\u2010sialic acid interactions, promotes efficient release of newly formed virions from (sialic acid\u2010carrying) infected cells, and provides a counterweight to the interaction of hemagglutinin molecules with nontarget cell\u2010associated glycans: neuraminidase\u2010mediated removal of sialic acids from decoy receptors prevents virions from establishing high\u2010avidity interactions with these glycoconjugates and may even provide an escape route for virions after hemagglutinin\u2010mediated binding to nontarget cell\u2010associated glycans (Colman, 1994; Suzuki et al., 1994; Gimsa et al., 1996; Barrere et al., 1997; Gamblin & Skehel, 2010). Conceivably, a functional balance between the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase activities is an important determinant of the (replicative) fitness of IAV variants in vivo. Using IAV as a paradigm, Fig. 5b illustrates how viral RDE activity can balance the high avidity of viral lectins where favorable and consequently improve viral infection efficiency.",

            "text": "In contrast to influenza A and B viruses, other viruses combine both lectin and RDE functions in one protein complex. For example, the viral membranes of mumps virus, Newcastle disease virus, Sendai virus, and human parainfluenza virus 3 and 5 are studded with hemagglutinin\u2010neuraminidase proteins (Bowden et al., 2010; Harrison et al., 2010; Chang & Dutch, 2012). Another example is the influenza C virus, which carries the hemagglutination, RDE and fusion protein functions in one single envelope protein named the hemagglutinin\u2010esterase\u2010fusion protein (Nakada et al., 1984; Herrler et al., 1985a, b; Rogers et al., 1986; Vlasak et al., 1987; Herrler et al., 1988; Schauer et al., 1988; Herrler & Klenk, 1991; Herrler et al., 1991; Rosenthal et al., 1998; Pekosz & Lamb, 1999; Lamb & Krug, 2001; Suzuki & Nei, 2002). Whereas the RDE of influenza A and B viruses is a neuraminidase, which cleaves off entire sialic acid residues, the RDE of influenza C functions as a sialate\u2010O\u2010acetylesterase and cleaves off specific O\u2010acetyl groups (Herrler et al., 1985b; Vlasak et al., 1987; Herrler et al., 1988; Schauer et al., 1988; Pekosz & Lamb, 1999). A similar situation is seen for certain coronaviruses and toroviruses that carry an accessory protein called hemagglutinin\u2010esterase on their surface (de Groot, 2006). As the name implies, functional hemagglutinin\u2010esterase proteins combine a hemagglutinating activity with a sialate\u2010O\u2010acetylesterase activity (de Groot, 2006). Interestingly, for some coronaviruses, the hemagglutinin\u2010esterase protein is not the only envelope protein endowed with a lectin activity. For example, the spike proteins of bovine coronavirus and human coronavirus OC43 have been shown to be potent sialic acid\u2010binding lectins (Schultze et al., 1991; Kunkel & Herrler, 1993). Also the spike protein of the transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus of pigs has been shown to possess such a lectin activity (Schultze et al., 1996; Krempl et al., 1997, 2000; Schwegmann\u2010Wessels et al., 2011). However, transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus has no hemagglutinin\u2010esterase protein that serves as RDE to counteract the hemagglutinating activity of the spike protein.",

Paradoxically, many of the host lectins that are exploited by viruses form part of the immune system. Although capture of viral pathogens by these lectins may have certain antiviral effects or promote the specific immunity against this pathogen (cfr. supra), many viruses can also employ such interactions to promote efficient infection and spread or to facilitate persistence (Table 2). Virus binding to membrane\u2010associated lectins can lead to concentration of virions at the cell surface and can facilitate infection of target cells. In many cases, host lectins appear to function as true portals for viral entry: the virus binds to the lectin, which drives subsequent internalization of the virus into specific cellular compartments from which the virus can initiate the next stage of infection. However, it has also been shown that lectins present on non\u2010target cells may facilitate infection of target cells, a process called trans\u2010infection. Many membrane\u2010associated (immune system) lectins also participate in specific signaling pathways and engagement of such lectins by a virus may modulate both viral infection and the immune response in favor of the pathogen.",

This molecule is mainly expressed on dendritic cells (DCs), but expression on distinct other cell\u2010types \u2013 including macrophages, B lymphocytes, platelets, and (immortalized) podocytes \u2013 has also been described (Geijtenbeek et al., 2000a, b; Soilleux et al., 2002; Granelli\u2010Piperno et al., 2005; Gurney et al., 2005; Chaipan et al., 2006; Rappocciolo et al., 2006; Mikulak et al., 2010; Svajger et al., 2010). Prototypic DC\u2010SIGN molecules consist of a C\u2010terminal C\u2010type CRD, a neck region made up of 7 and a half 23 aa residue repeats, a transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic domain containing motifs involved in receptor internalization and signaling (Svajger et al., 2010; Tsegaye & Pohlmann, 2010). Lectin monomers typically multimerize via their neck regions to form tetramers, which in turn organize in nanoclusters on the cell membrane (Svajger et al., 2010; Tsegaye & Pohlmann, 2010; Manzo et al., 2012). DC\u2010SIGN functions as a receptor for various ligands. The T cell\u2010expressed molecule ICAM\u20103 is probably its most prominent endogenous ligand: DC\u2010SIGN binds ICAM\u20103 on the T cell surface and thereby contributes to the transient, nonantigen\u2010specific interaction of DC with T cells that is required for efficient screening of MHCII\u2010peptide complexes and eventual T cell priming (Geijtenbeek et al., 2000a; Svajger et al., 2010). Moreover, DC\u2010SIGN has been implicated in various other processes, including DC differentiation, migration, and antigen capture (Svajger et al., 2010). Over the last decade, it has become apparent that DC\u2010SIGN interacts with a wide variety of viral pathogens.",

DC\u2010SIGN can bind the enveloped HIV\u20101 particle and mainly recognizes mannose\u2010rich glycans on the viral envelope glycoprotein gp120 (Curtis et al., 1992; Geijtenbeek et al., 2000a, b; Feinberg et al., 2001; Hong et al., 2002; Lin et al., 2003; Su et al., 2004; Hong et al., 2007). The efficiency of HIV\u20101 capture by DC\u2010SIGN has been linked to receptor density. Experiments in 293 T\u2010Rex cells using an inducible DC\u2010SIGN expression system have shown that high surface expression levels of DC\u2010SIGN correlate with optimal binding of HIV\u20101 particles, and that lowering the DC\u2010SIGN expression levels can significantly reduce the efficiency of HIV\u20101 binding (Pohlmann et al., 2001). These data suggest that the high DC\u2010SIGN surface expression levels on certain (immature) DC subsets are compatible with optimal capture of HIV\u20101 virions, whereas lower DC\u2010SIGN expression levels on B lymphocytes and especially platelets may be mirrored in a less efficient HIV\u20101 capture (Baribaud et al., 2002; Boukour et al., 2006; Chaipan et al., 2006; Rappocciolo et al., 2006). Nevertheless, studies have shown that also B lymphocytes and platelets can effectively bind HIV\u20101 virions via DC\u2010SIGN (Boukour et al., 2006; Chaipan et al., 2006; Rappocciolo et al., 2006). Evidently, the interaction between HIV\u20101 and DC\u2010SIGN is also critically dependent on the viral glycome. Recent research has shown that virion\u2010associated gp120 of peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC)\u2010grown virus predominantly carries oligomannose N\u2010glycans (Doores et al., 2010; Bonomelli et al., 2011), which constitute optimal ligands for DC\u2010SIGN (van Liempt et al., 2006). Nevertheless, virus originating from different host cell types can display a different glycosylation profile, and this may modulate the efficiency of DC\u2010SIGN recruitment (Lin et al., 2003).",

In DC\u2010SIGN\u2010expressing antigen\u2010presenting cells, most of the DC\u2010SIGN\u2010captured virions appear to be internalized into the endolysosomal pathway and rapidly degraded (Moris et al., 2004; Turville et al., 2004). In line with this, DC\u2010SIGN was found to promote MHCII\u2010restricted presentation of HIV\u20101 antigens (Moris et al., 2006). Intriguingly however, in cells that co\u2010express CD4 and CCR5/CXCR4 (HIV\u20101 receptor and co\u2010receptors, respectively), DC\u2010SIGN expression also facilitates HIV\u20101 fusion: DC\u2010SIGN efficiently captures and concentrates viral particles at the cell surface, and binding of this lectin to the HIV\u20101 envelope protein appears to increase exposure of the CD4 binding site (Lee et al., 2001; Nobile et al., 2005; Burleigh et al., 2006; Hijazi et al., 2011). Although DC\u2010SIGN\u2010mediated enhancement of HIV\u20101 fusion may promote MHCI\u2010restricted presentation of HIV\u20101 antigen (proteasome and TAP\u2010dependent pathway) and activation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (Moris et al., 2004), enhanced HIV fusion inevitably leads to more efficient infection. Indeed, several studies confirm that DC\u2010SIGN facilitates productive (cis\u2010) infection in DC\u2010SIGN\u2010expressing cells that also co\u2010express CD4 and CCR5/CXCR4 (Lee et al., 2001; Nobile et al., 2005; Burleigh et al., 2006; Hijazi et al., 2011).",

Subsequent studies on the subject reported DC\u2010SIGN\u2010mediated internalization of infectious HIV\u20101 virions into low pH nonlysosomal compartments, and advocated that the virus traffics in intracellular compartments towards the zone of T cell contact, where it is released into the infectious synapse (i.e. the contact zone between the virus\u2010loaded cell and the target T cell) (Kwon et al., 2002; McDonald et al., 2003). DC\u2010captured HIV\u20101 virions as well as T\u2010cell\u2010expressed CD4 and CCR5/CXCR4 were found to concentrate at the DC\u2010T\u2010cell interface, rendering it an ideal micro\u2010environment for efficient infection of target T cells (McDonald et al., 2003). Moreover, it was postulated that DC\u2010SIGN\u2010mediated capture of HIV\u20101 virions temporarily protects them from degradation and preserves viral infectivity (Geijtenbeek et al., 2000b; Kwon et al., 2002).",

This model posits that submucosal DCs capture and internalize HIV\u20101 virions via DC\u2010SIGN and, by homing to the lymph nodes, provide a means of transport for the virus to a compartment rich in target cells. The virus\u2010loaded DCs then interact with CD4+ T cells and the virions are transferred to the target T cell via the infectious synapse, ultimately resulting in efficient target cell infection (Geijtenbeek et al., 2000b; Baribaud et al., 2001; Sewell & Price, 2001). However, recent research is not always in line with this initial model and has challenged several of its key features. Cavrois et al. (2007) reported that HIV\u20101 trans\u2010infection does not require intracellular virus trafficking, but primarily depends on cell surface\u2010associated virions that reach the infectious synapses via transport on the cell surface (Cavrois et al., 2007). In line with this, Yu et al. (2008) reported that HIV\u20101 traffics towards the infectious synapse through a specialized, surface\u2010accessible intracellular compartment (Yu et al., 2008). In addition, reports stating that virus capture by DC\u2010SIGN mainly leads to virus internalization into the endolysosomal pathway and subsequent degradation (Moris et al., 2004; Turville et al., 2004; Moris et al., 2006) and that DC\u2010SIGN\u2010mediated trans\u2010infection can only occur within the first hours after virus attachment (Turville et al., 2004) seem to downplay the importance of DC\u2010SIGN\u2010mediated trans\u2010infection for efficient HIV\u20101 infection and spread. These and other data counter the theory that HIV\u20101 capture by DCs preserves viral infectivity, and suggest that the presence \u2013 and transfer \u2013 of infectious virus at later time points may be ascribed to productive DC infection (Turville et al., 2004; Nobile et al., 2005; Burleigh et al., 2006; Wang et al., 2007a). It is also noteworthy that, whereas initial studies identified DC\u2010SIGN as the main factor involved in HIV\u20101 capture and transmission by DCs (Geijtenbeek et al., 2000b), recent studies also implicate other lectins in this process (Turville et al., 2002; Izquierdo\u2010Useros et al., 2012) or even conclude that DC\u2010SIGN is not involved in DC\u2010mediated HIV\u20101 trans\u2010infection (Boggiano et al., 2007). Differences in virus strains, cell types, and experimental setup might in part explain these conflicting data. Intriguingly, other recent work indicates that DC\u2010SIGN\u2010expressing B lymphocytes and platelets may effectively capture and transfer infectious HIV\u20101 via DC\u2010SIGN (Boukour et al., 2006; Chaipan et al., 2006; Rappocciolo et al., 2006), potentially implicating these cells/cell fragments in HIV\u20101 dissemination in infected patients, although recent work suggests that platelets might negatively regulate viral spread by secretion of CXCL4 (Auerbach et al., 2012; Tsegaye et al., 2013). Clearly, further research is necessary to allow a better understanding of DC\u2010SIGN\u2010mediated HIV\u20101 trans\u2010infection and its relevance for viral infection and spread in vivo.",

Recruitment of DC\u2010SIGN by HIV\u20101 also triggers signal transduction that modulates immune responses and infection of DCs and adjacent target cells more indirectly. For example, Hodges et al. (2007) reported that binding of HIV\u20101 to DC\u2010SIGN compromises DC maturation and primes these cells for trans\u2010infection: Upregulation of CD86 and MHCII is suppressed, whereas synapse formation between DCs and CD4+ T cells is promoted (Hodges et al., 2007). Moreover, HIV\u20101 binding to DC\u2010SIGN was shown to activate Cdc42 and promote formation of membrane extensions that facilitate HIV\u20101 transfer to CD4+ lymphocytes (Nikolic et al., 2011). Other work by Gringhuis et al. (2007, 2010) showed that binding of HIV\u20101 to DC\u2010SIGN triggers Raf\u20101 dependent signaling, which modulates toll\u2010like receptor (TLR)\u2010elicited signals to induce synthesis of full\u2010length HIV transcripts as well as production of the immunosuppressive cytokine IL\u201010 (Gringhuis et al., (2007, 2010).

In vitro experiments pointed out that galectin\u20101 can enhance HIV\u20101 infection of different cell types \u2013 including human lymphoid cell lines, PBMC, CD4+ T lymphocytes, and monocyte\u2010derived macrophages (Ouellet et al., 2005; Mercier et al., 2008) \u2013 and increase HIV\u20101 infection in an ex vivo lymphoid tissue model (Ouellet et al., 2005). Further experiments showed that galectin\u20101 accelerates virion binding to the target cell surface, probably by crosslinking viral and cellular glycans (Ouellet et al., 2005; Mercier et al., 2008). A more recent study confirmed these findings and showed that galectin\u20101 binds to clusters of N\u2010linked glycans on the viral gp120 envelope protein in a \u03b2\u2010galactoside\u2010dependent manner (St\u2010Pierre et al., 2011).

In sum, it appears that the dimeric lectin galectin\u20101 can enhance HIV\u20101 infection efficiency by cross\u2010linking viral and host cell glycans and thereby promoting firmer adhesion of the virus to the target cell surface and facilitating virus\u2010receptor interactions (Ouellet et al., 2005; Mercier et al., 2008; St\u2010Pierre et al., 2011; Sato et al., 2012).",

A notable example in this context are the noroviruses, a major cause of nonbacterial gastroenteritis in humans. It is well known that the viral capsids of most human noroviruses display an affinity for HBGAs, structurally related but highly polymorphic carbohydrate structures found on proteins and lipids of epithelial cells in the gastrointestinal and respiratory tract, on the surfaces of red blood cells and as free antigens in body fluids such as saliva, blood, and intestinal contents (Bu et al., 2008; Choi et al., 2008; Shirato, 2011). Different noroviruses display distinct HBGA specificities and can be categorized according to the (range of) HBGA structures they preferentially bind (Huang et al., 2005; Shirato, 2011). Human HBGA synthesis is controlled by various enzymes, including the glycosyltransferase enzymes encoded in the ABO, FUT2, and FUT3 gene loci. The presence of variant (functional or nonfunctional) alleles at these and other relevant gene loci is a key determinant of HBGA phenotype, as it controls which ABH and Lewis antigens an individual can synthesize (Le Pendu et al., 2006; Shirato, 2011). Although it is still unclear whether they function as primary receptors for noroviruses, current data indicate that HBGAs are important determinants of the noroviral tissue specificity. Moreover, several studies have established a link between HBGA geno\u2010/phenotype and individual susceptibility to (clinical) infection with specific norovirus variants: HBGA phenotypes matching the specificity of the viral lectin correlate with a higher risk of (clinical) infection, whereas nonmatching HBGA phenotypes correlate with relative resistance (Le Pendu et al., 2006; Shirato, 2011).",

Polymorphisms in the promoter region of the DC\u2010SIGN\u2010encoding CD209 gene can affect protein expression levels and have been linked with altered susceptibility to and/or altered disease progression after infection with several viral pathogens, including HIV\u20101 and Dengue virus (Martin et al., 2004; Sakuntabhai et al., 2005; Koizumi et al., 2007; Selvaraj et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2011; Boily\u2010Larouche et al., 2012). Moreover, distinct gene polymorphisms in the DC\u2010SIGN\u2010encoding region as well as alternative splicing events give rise to different isoforms of the protein, ranging from variants containing single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to variants with truncated lectin domains, variable numbers of 23\u2010aa\u2010residue repeats in the neck domain, alternative cytoplasmic domains or a lacking transmembrane region (Mummidi et al., 2001; Liu et al., 2004; Serrano\u2010Gomez et al., 2008; Boily\u2010Larouche et al., 2012). Information on the expression and biological activity of most of these DC\u2010SIGN variants is rather limited. Recently, however, Boily\u2010Larouche et al. (2012) reported that naturally occurring genetic variants of DC\u2010SIGN, carrying specific SNPs in the neck domain\u2010encoding exon 4, have an enhanced capacity to capture and transfer HIV\u20101 virions to CD4+ T lymphocytes. Moreover, Liu et al. (2004) described different neck domain length variants of DC\u2010SIGN \u2013 carrying variable numbers of 23\u2010aa\u2010residue repeats in the neck region \u2013 and correlated neck domain length heterozygosity with a reduced risk of HIV\u20101 infection. Recent experimental data provide evidence that naturally occurring DC\u2010SIGN neck domain variants can differ in multimerization competence in the cell membrane and display altered glycan binding capacity (Serrano\u2010Gomez et al., 2008). Moreover, the presence of such neck domain variants appears to modulate multimerization of the prototypic DC\u2010SIGN molecule (Serrano\u2010Gomez et al., 2008). The fact that neck domain variation may influence the presence, stability, and functionality of DC\u2010SIGN multimers on the cell surface can provide a molecular explanation for the link between DC\u2010SIGN polymorphisms and susceptibility to HIV\u20101 and other pathogens, although further research is needed to substantiate this (Serrano\u2010Gomez et al., 2008).",

            "text": "Although viruses rely on the host cell machinery for glycoconjugate synthesis, viral glycosylation profiles can significantly differ from the standard glycosylation profile of their host cell. For instance, it is well known that viral glycoproteins are often more heavily glycosylated than host glycoproteins, and that also the nature of their glycan modifications can significantly differ. A prototypic example in this context is the gp120 glycoprotein of HIV\u20101. The HIV\u20101 envelope is studded with trimers of noncovalently associated gp120/gp41 heterodimers (White et al., 2010). Gp120 is one of the most heavily N\u2010glycosylated proteins in nature: it contains more than 20 N\u2010linked glycosylation sites, and N\u2010glycans account for about half of its molecular weight (Zhu et al., 2000; Wei et al., 2003; Pantophlet & Burton, 2006; Scanlan et al., 2007). Intriguingly, whereas mammalian glycoproteins typically carry mainly complex type N\u2010glycans, this is not the case for the viral gp120 glycoprotein. Recent reasearch has shown that virion\u2010associated gp120 of PBMC\u2010grown virus \u2013 as opposed to recombinantly expressed monomeric gp120 \u2013 predominantly carries oligomannose N\u2010glycans (Doores et al., 2010; Bonomelli et al., 2011). The synthesis of this unusual glycosylation profile appears to be partially directed by the structure of the gp120/gp41 spike itself: the presence of a dense N\u2010glycan cluster in gp120, combined with the steric consequences of gp120/gp41 trimerization, seems to hinder further processing of (normally transient) biosynthetic glycan intermediates by ER and Golgi \u03b1\u2010mannosidases, ultimately yielding HIV\u20101 virions with oligomannose\u2010enriched gp120 glycoproteins (Zhu et al., 2000; Doores et al., 2010; Eggink et al., 2010; Bonomelli et al., 2011). Clearly, although viral glycosylation is critically dependent on the glycosylation machinery of the host cell, the genetic and structural background of a virus can have a decisive influence in this process.",

Moreover, viruses may also actively modify the host and viral glycome by modulating the expression of host cell glycoenzymes (Hiraiwa et al., 1997; Cebulla et al., 2000; Hiraiwa et al., 2003) or via expression of virally encoded glycoenzymes in infected cells (Jackson et al., 1999; Willer et al., 1999; Nash et al., 2000; Sujino et al., 2000; Vanderplasschen et al., 2000; Markine\u2010Goriaynoff et al., 2003, 2004a, b).",

            "text": "An additional source of glycan variation can be discerned for viruses that can infect multiple cell types, or even different host species. For instance, it is well known that HIV can productively infect multiple cell types, and that HIV glycosylation is cell type\u2010dependent (Liedtke et al., 1994; Willey et al., 1996; Liedtke et al., 1997; Lin et al., 2003). Cell type\u2010dependent glycosylation differences for HIV have been shown to impact viral interaction with and trans\u2010infection via DC\u2010SIGN (Lin et al., 2003), as well as viral sensitivity to antibody neutralization (Willey et al., 1996). Another, particularly fascinating example in this context is Dengue virus (DV). DV is a mosquito\u2010borne flavivirus that can replicate in mosquitos as well as in humans (Navarro\u2010Sanchez et al., 2003; Dejnirattisai et al., 2011). In humans, immature skin DCs are considered the primary target cell for the virus after a mosquito bite, and DC\u2010SIGN is believed to be the main DV receptor on these cells (Navarro\u2010Sanchez et al., 2003; Dejnirattisai et al., 2011). In a recent study, it was shown that insect cell\u2010derived DV can efficiently infect DCs, whereas DC\u2010derived DV is not able to reinfect DCs (Dejnirattisai et al., 2011). Similarly, insect cell\u2010derived DV could efficiently bind and infect a DC\u2010SIGN\u2010expessing cell line, whereas this was not the case for DC\u2010derived DV (Dejnirattisai et al., 2011). Finally, it was found that insect cell\u2010derived DV predominantly contains high\u2010/pauci\u2010mannose\u2010type N\u2010glycans, whereas DC\u2010derived virus contains only complex type N\u2010glycans (Dejnirattisai et al., 2011). Projected against the background of DV infection, these data outline a tentative model of the first stages of DV infection in humans: during DV replication in mosquito cells, newly formed DV virions obtain mannose\u2010rich glycans. Upon viral transfer to a human host, these virions efficiently infect immature skin DCs via DC\u2010SIGN. Importantly, DV replication in skin DCs yields virions with complex type N\u2010glycans, thus creating a \u2018glycan mismatch\u2019 with DC\u2010SIGN. Due to this mismatch, newly synthesized DC\u2010derived virus will not readily reinfect DCs via DC\u2010SIGN, but preferentially infect other potential host cells via other receptors (Dejnirattisai et al., 2011). Although much more research is needed to verify this tentative model, it elegantly illustrates how cell type\u2010dependent glycan variability may impact a viral infection process.",

This seems especially significant for RNA viruses, as these viruses generally evolve more rapidly than DNA viruses due to factors inherent to their biology and infection strategy (Belshaw et al., 2008; Holmes, 2009; Lauring & Andino, 2010). The higher mutation frequency of many RNA viruses directly implies a higher chance for addition or deletion of putative glycosylation sites. As has been shown for IAV, acquisition or deletion of glycosylation sites may affect crucial steps in the viral infection/replication process (e.g. receptor binding, fusion, release of newly formed virions) (Ohuchi et al., 1997; Wagner et al., 2000; Tsuchiya et al., 2002; Kim & Park, 2012), alter the capacity of the virus to avoid induction of/recognition by virus\u2010specific antibodies (glycan shielding) (Wang et al., 2009; Wei et al., 2010; Wanzeck et al., 2011; Kim & Park, 2012; Job et al., 2013; Sun et al., 2013), and modulate viral interaction with various immune system lectins (Reading et al., 2007; Vigerust et al., 2007; Reading et al., 2009; Tate et al., 2011a, b).

Finally, functional alterations in the viral RDE due to mutations may also have a strong impact on the interaction of viral lectins with host cell glycans. In the case of IAV, balanced lectin and RDE functions appear to be crucial for efficient viral replication. For IAV variants that are well adapted to a certain host species, the substrate specificity and activity of the neuraminidase generally match the ligand specificity and affinity of the hemagglutinin (Wagner et al., 2002). Disruption of this balance \u2013 for instance due to reassortment or transmission to a new host species \u2013 often results in a decreased replicative fitness (Wagner et al., 2002). Interestingly, however, the virus may overcome this hurdle and evolve towards replicative competence by selecting for compensatory mutations in hemagglutinin and/or neuraminidase that restore the functional balance between these molecules (Wagner et al., 2002). Considering these data on IAV, it is conceivable that the balance between viral lectin and RDE is also an important determinant of the replicative fitness of several other viruses.",

Binding of glycan decoys with a specific lectin can inhibit binding of other ligands by this lectin. For instance, it has been shown that multivalent mannose\u2010containing molecules or mannose\u2010based glycomimetics can compromise binding of HIV\u20101 gp120 with DC\u2010SIGN (Wang et al., 2008b; Luallen et al., 2009; Martinez\u2010Avila et al., 2009b; Becer et al., 2010) and inhibit DC\u2010SIGN\u2010mediated trans\u2010infection of CD4+ T lymphocytes (Martinez\u2010Avila et al., 2009a; Sattin et al., 2010; Berzi et al., 2012).

This is elegantly exemplified in several recent studies, showing that mannose\u2010 as well as N\u2010acetylglucosamine\u2010specific CBAs can effectively prevent DC\u2010SIGN\u2010mediated HIV\u20101 capture and subsequent transmission to T lymphocytes (Balzarini et al., 2010; Balzarini et al., 2007a; Bertaux et al., 2007; Huskens et al., 2010; Hoorelbeke et al., 2011; Alexandre et al., 2012). Although CBA binding to host cell\u2010associated glycans may inhibit viruses that employ viral lectins, the potential of this strategy for antiviral therapy remains virtually unexplored. It is noteworthy that the antiviral activity of CBAs or glycan decoys that bind to virion surfaces is not necessarily limited to direct inhibition of crucial glycan\u2013lectin interactions, as they can mask greater portions of the virus and interfere with other crucial (including non\u2010glycan\u2010lectin) interactions or steps in the infection process. Moreover, recent research on HIV\u20101 highlights the antiviral potential of CBAs from yet another angle. Although the heavily glycosylated HIV\u20101 gp120 protein generally provides multiple ligands for mannose\u2010 and GlcNAc\u2010specific CBAs, prolonged CBA pressure selects for HIV\u20101 variants with multiple N\u2010glycosylation site deletions in the gp120 protein that are less sensitive to CBA\u2010mediated neutralization (Balzarini et al., 2004, 2005a, b; Witvrouw et al., 2005; Balzarini et al., 2006; Balzarini, 2007b, c; Balzarini et al., 2007b; Huskens et al., 2007). Interestingly, however, deletion of N\u2010glycosylation sites can also increase the immunogenicity of the virus and weaken the glycan shield that protects the virus from recognition by virus\u2010specific antibodies and other (nonlectin) immune receptors (Botarelli et al., 1991; Back et al., 1994; Reitter et al., 1998; Bolmstedt et al., 2001; Kang et al., 2005), and may decrease the efficiency of HIV\u20101 trans\u2010infection via immune system lectins like DC\u2010SIGN (Hong et al., 2007; Liao et al., 2011). In addition, it appears that accumulation of mutations under CBA pressure is often paralleled by a significant reduction of the viral fitness, which is obviously advantageous in the context of an antiviral treatment (Balzarini et al., 2005a; Balzarini, 2007b, c). For further information on CBAs and their potential in antiviral therapy, readers may refer to recent expert reviews on this topic (Balzarini, 2007c; Francois & Balzarini, 2012).",

Alternatively, various drugs may be employed to directly modify glycan synthesis: glycoconjugates produced in the presence of such molecules will obtain aberrant glycosylation, which may promote or annihilate their interaction with specific lectins. Promising results in glycovirological research have highlighted the antiviral potential of such compounds. For instance, ample data indicate that sialidases may be used to counteract infections where sialic acids play important roles as cellular receptors for viral lectins [e.g. IAV binds to sialic acid receptors on the airway epithelium (Skehel & Wiley, 2000; Malakhov et al., 2006; Belser et al., 2007; Harrison, 2008; Chan et al., 2009; Triana\u2010Baltzer et al., 2009a, b, 2010, 2011)] or as viral ligands for host lectins that serve as portals for viral entry [e.g. sialic acids on the porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus bind the macrophage\u2010specific entry mediator sialoadhesin (Delputte & Nauwynck, 2004; Delputte et al., 2007; Van Breedam et al., 2010a, b)]. Sialidase treatment may also enhance recognition of viral glycoconjugates by mannose\u2010specific immune system lectins that can limit viral infection: in vitro experiments have shown that enzymatic removal of sialic acids from the HIV\u20101 virion surface can significantly enhance virus binding and neutralization by MBL (Hart et al., 2002, 2003). In line with this, production of HIV\u20101 in the presence of the Golgi \u03b11\u20102\u2010mannosidase I inhibitor 1\u2010deoxymannojirimycin \u2013 which blocks the biosynthesis of complex\u2010type, sialylated oligosaccharides \u2013 increased susceptibility of the virus to MBL\u2010mediated neutralization (Hart et al., 2003). Interestingly, 1\u2010deoxymannojirimycin treatment of HIV\u20101\u2010infected cells was also shown to potentiate the antiviral effects of mannose\u2010specific plant CBAs towards the newly produced HIV\u20101 virions (Balzarini, 2007c). These and other examples illustrate the potential of these molecules as antiviral drugs.",

For instance, interfering with host cell glycosylation processes using specific inhibitors may inhibit assembly of infectious virions (Leavitt et al., 1977; Katz et al., 1980; Pizer et al., 1980; Herrler & Compans, 1983; Montefiori et al., 1988; Pal et al., 1989; Mehta et al., 1998; Dwek et al., 2002; Wu et al., 2002; Durantel et al., 2007; Lazar et al., 2007; Scanlan et al., 2007; Durantel, 2009; Merry & Astrautsova, 2010). Moreover, glycome modulation may significantly alter the capacity of the virus to evade recognition by virus\u2010specific antibodies and B\u2010 and T\u2010cell receptors via glycan shielding (Botarelli et al., 1991; Back et al., 1994; Willey et al., 1996; Reitter et al., 1998; Bolmstedt et al., 2001; Kang et al., 2005; Aguilar et al., 2006; Wang et al., 2009; Francica et al., 2010; Kobayashi & Suzuki, 2012).

Furthermore, patients infected with a virus that employs both viral lectins and RDEs may also benefit from treatment with RDE\u2010specific inhibitors, as these can alter the balance between viral lectin and RDE activity which is often crucial for efficient viral replication and spread. Notable examples in this context are the several neuraminidase inhibitors that have been used successfully for the treatment of IAV infections (Kim et al., 1999; Lew et al., 2000; Roberts, 2001; Garman & Laver, 2004; Alymova et al., 2005; von itzstein, 2007; von itzstein & Thomson, 2009; Gamblin & Skehel, 2010; Ikematsu & Kawai, 2011).",

However, the antiviral strategies suggested above can also have drawbacks. Intensive use of antiviral therapeutics may elicit rapid selection of drug\u2010resistant virus variants. Another possible drawback relates to the potential off\u2010target effects of these therapies: therapeutics aimed at influencing specific glycan\u2013lectin interactions that play key roles in viral infection processes may also affect general host glycosylation, lectin expression or glycan\u2013lectin interactions that are crucial for normal functioning of the host and its immune defense. It is also conceivable that such drugs, despite their antiviral effects, may benefit the virus in some ways. For instance, although a glycome\u2010modifying drug may promote viral recognition by specific immune system lectins that aid in viral clearance, it may also promote viral interaction with host lectins that can aid in cis\u2010 or trans\u2010infection. Ultimately, the potential of specific agents as antiviral drugs depends on their net (antiviral) effects in vivo. Other potential disadvantages concern the pharmacokinetic properties of specific drugs. For instance, if glycan decoys or CBAs used in antiviral therapy show a broad reactivity and can respectively bind with multiple (nontarget) lectins or glycans in the host, it is possible that much of the antiviral effect is lost. Also, when using peptidic CBAs that are not native to the host, an antibody response might be mounted against these components, leading to neutralization and/or faster clearance of the active compound. In spite of these and other potential pitfalls, it is clear that glycan decoys and CBAs, as well as various indirect approaches to modulate glycan\u2013lectin interaction, show potential for the treatment of diverse viral infections, either or not in combination with other antiviral strategies. A good understanding of relevant glycan\u2013lectin interactions facilitates specific targeting of these binding events and can help to minimize possible off\u2010target effects and to reduce the risk of drug resistance.",

In general, the nature of the glycan, the lectin, and the specific conditions under which their interaction occurs determines the outcome of a specific binding event and directs the virus to a certain fate. Based on current knowledge, it is clear that viral lectins generally facilitate viral infection and spread. On the other hand, although it may seem intuitive that host lectin PRRs and other immune system lectins exclusively act in defense of the host, there is ample evidence that contradicts this. Although many host lectins are involved in the induction of an efficacious immune response against viral pathogens, many viruses can also abuse these lectins to promote infection and spread. Intriguingly, analysis of the many studies regarding the role of host lectins in viral infections suggests that soluble host lectins tend to be associated with antiviral activity, whereas membrane\u2010associated host lectins seem to play a more dubious role and are often implicated in pro\u2010 as well as antiviral mechanisms (Tables 1, 2). It is however noteworthy that the information provided in this manuscript reflects current views on glycan\u2013lectin interactions in virus biology, and that future research may alter our understanding and interpretation of specific interactions.

The nature of the glycan structures that decorate the common glycan core \u2013 the glycan part shown in a dashed box \u2013 dictates classification of N\u2010linked glycans as high\u2010mannose type, hybrid type or complex type glycans, examples of which are shown in the panel. (b) GalNAc\u03b1\u2010Ser/Thr type O\u2010linked glycans have a GalNAc residue \u03b1\u2010linked to the oxygen atom of the hydroxyl group of Ser or Thr residues. Unlike for GlcNAc\u03b2\u2010Asn type N\u2010linked protein glycosylation, there are no clear amino acid motifs that mark these O\u2010linked glycosylation sites. A single GalNac residue linked to the Ser/Thr is termed the \u2018Tn antigen\u2019. Depending on the basic structure of the glycan core, more complex (extended) O\u2010linked glycans are categorized into different \u2018core types\u2019. Cores 1\u20134 are the most common core structures, but also other core types exist. The Tn antigen and examples of extended core 1, 2, 3, and 4 O\u2010glycans are shown in the panel. The distinct glycan cores are shown in dashed boxes. (c) Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) are linear polysaccharide chains composed of repeated disaccharide subunits of a uronic acid/galactose residue and an amino sugar. Glycosaminoglycans are classified as hyaluronan (HA), heparan sulfate/heparin (HS), chondroitin sulfate (CS), dermatan sulfate (DS), or keratan sulfate (KS), depending on the structure of their basic disaccharide subunits (shown in square brackets) and further modification (e.g. sulfation at different positions) of the glycan chain. With exception of hyaluronan, all major glycosaminoglycan types are sulfated and occur covalently linked to proteins. HS, CS, and DS are found on Ser\u2010linked xylose residues. Although no unambiguous consensus sequence for xylosylation exists, the Ser attachment site is consistently flanked by a Gly residue at its carboxy\u2010terminal side. As depicted in the figure, heparan sulfate and heparin have the same basic structure. Although they share a common biosynthesis, heparin generally undergoes more extensive sulfation and epimerization of uronic acid to iduronic acid. Moreover, heparin is synthesized only in connective tissue mast cells as part of serglycin proteoglycans, whereas heparan sulfate is synthesized in virtually all mammalian cells. KS is found on Asn\u2010linked N\u2010glycan core structures (KS I) or Ser/Thr\u2010linked O\u2010glycan core 2 structures (KS II). Capping or further modification of the glycosaminoglycan chains \u2013 sulfation excepted \u2013 is not depicted (adapted from Varki et al., 2009).",

Extension to larger glycan chains is common on ceramide\u2010linked glucose residues, whereas further glycan extension on ceramide\u2010linked galactose residues is more rare.

Core structures can be further modified with sialic acids or sulfate groups, which allows subclassification of glycosphingolipids as neutral (lacking charged carbohydrates or ionic groups), sialylated or sulfated. (b) Glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors are found in association with certain membrane proteins and serve as linkers between the protein and the lipid membrane.

In the C\u2010type CRD, a Ca2+ ion is directly involved in carbohydrate binding by making coordination bonds to both the CRD surface and key hydroxyl groups of the carbohydrate. The C\u2010type lectin family contains both membrane\u2010associated (a.1) and soluble (b.1) lectins. The collectins are solubleC\u2010type lectins characterized by the presence of collagen\u2010like domains. R\u2010type lectin domain: This term refers to a CRD that is structurally similar to the CRD in ricin, a toxin found in the plant Ricinus communis. I\u2010type lectin/I\u2010type lectin domain: I\u2010type lectins are glycan\u2010binding proteins that belong to the Ig superfamily, but are not antibodies or T\u2010cell receptors. The \u2018sialic acid\u2010binding Ig\u2010like lectin (siglec)\u2019 family of membrane\u2010associated lectins is currently the only well\u2010characterized group of I\u2010type lectins (a.2). Ficolin: Ficolins (b.2) are soluble lectins characterized by the presence of collagen\u2010like domains and fibrinogen\u2010like globular domains with a lectin activity. Galectin/S\u2010type lectin (domain): Galectins (b.3) are soluble lectins that typically bind \u03b2\u2010galactose\u2010containing glycoconjugates and show primary structural homology in their CRDs. Galectins were initially referred to as S\u2010type lectins to reflect their sulfhydryl dependency, the presence of cysteine residues and their solubility; however, at present, not all identified galectins fit this initial description anymore. Pentraxin/pentraxin domain: Pentraxins (b.4) are characterized by the presence of pentraxin domains, which contain an eight amino acid long conserved \u2018pentraxin signature\u2019 (HxCxS/TWxS, where x is any amino acid) and display an L\u2010type (Legume\u2010type) lectin fold.
