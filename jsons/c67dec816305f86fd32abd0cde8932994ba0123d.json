The countries chosen for examination are Spain, Italy, France and the UK. They have been selected because in each the pandemic is advanced, mortality high and any prospect of containment has passed. They have also been selected because in each social distancing has been used in an attempt to reduce peak daily mortality with relatively strict enforcement following a defined date. The choices of data set and model type is justified. The impact, if any, of social distancing is examined.",

In these circumstances it is reasonable to use a simple pandemic model to provide an overview of pandemic progress. This is in contradistinction to the complex numerical modelling with geographic inputs and outputs that provide detailed local morbidity data to inform logistics and planning. Mechanistic epidemiological models are often founded on unknown or imprecisely known parameters and in this sense are not precisely dynamic.

It should be noted that, although logistic in shape, the model does not exhaust all of the susceptible population over time. In this way it differs dynamically from Verhulst's original concept.

It has neither reduced the predicted peak in daily mortality nor has it altered its timing. With an average latency from the implementation of strict social distancing to an effect on mortality of 3.5 weeks, we can see that for it to have had an effect strict social distancing would have had to have been introduced at around the time of the first three deaths. This was nearly achieved in Germany with a closure of schools and colleges at 8 deaths and a blanket \"lockdown\" at 94 deaths. Their mortality has been much lower. We might introduce the term \"Delayed Social Distancing\" to distinguish it from \"Timely Social Distancing\", used where social distancing occurs much later than the date of the third death from a pandemic condition. [10] In contrast, the natural resolution of the pandemic has been delayed in Italy, Spain and the UK which now proceed along a second broader logistic. This contrasts with France's \"natural\" fast up and down daily mortality peak. The predicted total mortality is higher if based on the second phase logistic (of those countries with a biphasic pattern) than that based on the first. To explore this further the ratio of the growth factors g 0 for phases 1 and 2 was plotted vs. normalised predicted total mortality. g 0,1 g 0,2 is found from the ratio of the gradient of the regression lines for pandemic phases 1 and 2 in the plots of The old \"...stable door...\" adage seems surprisingly apposite. The increase in predicted total mortality with increasing social distancing effect (delayed) is quite unexpected. The pattern of mortality data might provide insight into possible underlying mechanisms. We know that certain groups are at higher risk of dying from Covid-19. Age, obesity, diabetes, gender and socio-economic status are all known factors influencing mortality in addition 13 .

A low aerobic fitness might be a common thread amongst all these factors and is likely to be adversely affected by a \"lock down\". This will be particularly true where the bulk of a person's exercise arises from the performance of their routine activities rather than any specific training, and where there are limited opportunities at home to maintain fitness because of a lack of space or overcrowding. We already know that a modest increase in 6 minute walking distance (6MWD) has a significant impact on survival in COPD. [11] 7 Conclusions If the proposed model correctly describes and predicts the evolution of the pandemic in the four countries studied then we may draw the following conclusions:",
