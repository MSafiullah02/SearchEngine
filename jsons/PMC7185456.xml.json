In 2007, The National Animal Health Monitoring System (NAHMS) for U.S. dairy reported that 57% of unweaned calf mortality was due to diarrhea especially in calves less than one month old (USDA Dairy, 2007). In Egypt, NCD continues to be the 1st cause of calf mortality, which ranges between 27.4% and 55% of the total deaths in young calves (Ahmed, 1980). The economic losses occur not only from mortality but also from other costs including treatment, diagnostics, labor, veterinary intervention and decreased number of herd replacements as well as subsequent chronic ill thrift and impaired growth performance (Bazeley, 2003).",

Among bacteria, enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) and Salmonellae are the most economically important pathogens (Ach\u00e1 et al., 2004), although other bacteria have also been identified as causes of enteric disease and NCD, e.g. Campylobacter species (Myers et al., 1984) and Clostridium species (Cho et al., 2010). Although co-infection is considerably observed in diarrheic calves, sometimes single infection is recorded. Farm geographic location, management practices, as well as herd size affect considerably the prevalence of the pathogen. (Cho and Yoon, 2014). Identification of the possible causative agent in outbreaks of diarrhea is important to allow targeted preventative measures, such as vaccination, and identification of possible risk factors or sources of infection (Izzo et al., 2011).",

S. \nenterica serovar typhimurium (S. Typhimurium) and serovar dublin (S. Dublin) are the most common causative agents of salmonellosis in cattle causing acute and systemic diarrheal diseases, respectively (Cho and Yoon, 2014). Diarrhea due to Salmonella infection is watery and mucoid with the presence of blood and fibrin (Fossler et al., 2005). Calves can shed Salmonella for variable periods of time and intermittently depending on the degree of infection (Cho and Yoon, 2014). Furthermore, after the disappearance of the organism from the intestinal tract, up to 5% of recovered animals may become carriers shedding the organism in their feces (Jay, 2000). Infected cattle and carriers can serve as source of infection for other animals or even human through food-borne routes or direct contact and so the determination of Salmonella strains in fecal samples is not only important for the diagnosis of salmonellosis, but also essential to identify the carriers (Warnick et al., 2003).",

E. \ncoli causes a watery diarrhea and weakness in 1\u20134 day old newborn calves. Death usually occurred within 24 hours due to severe dehydration (Cho et al., 2010). The fimbrial adhesion F5 (K99) promotes the adhesion of bacterial cells to glycoproteins on the epithelial surface of the jejunum and/or ileum, and bacterial enterotoxin also causes damage to the epithelial cells, resulting in fluid secretion and diarrhea (Acres, 1985).",

Infection with a non-host-adapted Salmonella results in transient shedding of organisms (3\u201316 weeks). The most common sources of infection are contaminated food and water. Approximately 40% of all animal-origin feed additives (bone or fish meals) are contaminated with Salmonella. Human sewage has also been tracked down as a source of infection in some herd outbreaks. Rodents, birds, and other animals spread infection through their feces and their carcasses (Donaldson et al., 2006). On contrary, S. Dublin is host-adapted in cattle, and commonly produces a carrier state in the recovered animals. It can survive intracellularly inside the mononuclear phagocytic cells in the face of high serum neutralizing antibody titers. Intermittent shedding occurs, which is maximized by stress factors. In outbreaks of S. Dublin infection, carriers are the most likely source. These asymptomatic carriers can shed organisms in their feces and milk for the remainder of their lives. Calves, which are fed raw, contaminated milk from the bulk tank, can be infected by this route (Lance et al., 1992).",

Although the administration of intravenous fluids and oral electrolyte solutions plays the main role in treatment, the efficacy of antimicrobial drugs in treating calf diarrhea is argumentative (Constable, 2004). Diarrheic calves are more likely to have failure or partial failure of passive transfer, and so they are more likely to be bacteraemic (Constable, 2004) and this is an additional cause that antimicrobial agents might be indicated in the treatment of calf diarrhea. The type of antibiotic drug should better be selected on the basis of its sensitivity, which could be detected by laboratory examination, and the antimicrobial treatment of diarrheic calves should therefore be focused against bacteria in the two sites of infection: the small intestine and the blood (Constable, 2004).",

On contrary, they were resistant to gentamycin, erythromycin and amoxicillin. On the other hand, the different E. \ncoli serogroups as well as the untyped group showed different degrees of sensitivity against the tested antibiotics. Mostly, E. \ncoli isolates showed high resistances against the majority of antimicrobials, meanwhile, high sensitivities were observed against marbofloxacin, spectinomycin and neomycin only. The high occurrence of resistance can be predicted since a large proportion of the animals are probably treated with antimicrobial drugs (de Verdier et al., 2012). Call et al. (2008) discussed the epidemiology of resistant E. \ncoli in calves as multifactorial, complex and e.g. influenced by co-selection due to linkage of resistance genes. Walk et al. (2007) supposed that regardless of use of antimicrobials, antibiotic resistance in E. \ncoli is co-selected in calves by an unknown \u201cbeneficial mutation.\u201d",
