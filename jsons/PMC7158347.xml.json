Molecular tools enhance case definitions, increasing specificity and reducing misclassification, and are now a standard tool in outbreak investigations. Although it is assumed during an outbreak that a single microbe is causing the clinical symptoms, it is possible that a microbe of the same genus and species but different strain is causing disease during the same time period. Molecular typing can distinguish between outbreak and nonoutbreak strains. Laboratory testing also distinguishes between syndromes with a similar clinical presentation. Laboratory screening can minimize misclassification of asymptomatic cases or cases in an early disease stage as nondiseased. Case definitions can be refined by including the molecular type as part of the case definition; this increases the specificity, reduces misclassification of nonoutbreak cases with outbreak cases, and thus increases the potential for identifying the outbreak source. There are a number of different types\nof laboratory tests that provide a molecular fingerprint. Most are based on the microbial genotype (see Chapter 5 for a description of different molecular fingerprinting methods), although phenotypic characteristics \u2013 such as serotype and antibiotic resistance profile \u2013 are also used. One typing method is called pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), and in 2010 it is the standard for typing food-borne outbreaks.",

An outbreak of a particular strain of Salmonella was first identified after a case of salmonellosis was reported to the health department in South Carolina. The first case identified a second case and the putative source \u2013 turtles.

Even during an epidemic, laboratory confirmation is required, as there can be more than one strain of influenza in circulation.

Spurious clusters do not have a common source, so their investigation wastes time and resources. Molecular typing helps link disease reports from different geographic areas, as we saw in the outbreak of Salmonella associated with turtles presented in Section 3.1. True outbreaks and clusters of the same strain can be traced back to a common source and presumably are amenable to public health intervention.

The prevalence of S. aureus colonization among the general population is 32% in the nares,6 but much higher in patients and personnel in hospitals and long-term care facilities. By typing strains causing infection among patients we can distinguish between a strain from the community and one circulating endemically or causing an outbreak within the hospital. The prevention and control strategies are different in each case, and thus it is important to distinguish between them. Screening new hospital patients for the presence of S. aureus and then intervening to prevent spread or self-inoculation can reduce introduction of new strains. For strains already circulating in the hospital, screening hospital personnel and retraining personnel on proper hygiene may be in order. In hospitals there are a variety of surfaces that may be contaminated with potential pathogens that might serve as a source of infection. A study conducted in a 1600-bed hospital in Taiwan explored whether computer keyboards and mice might be a source of pathogens.7 Though one of three major pathogens was cultured from 17% of the 282 computer keyboards or mice, the PFGE types were all different from the PFGE types of clinical specimens obtained from the same wards, suggesting that good hygiene was sufficient to keep these devices from being a source of infection.",

Food is frequently distributed widely; molecular tools enable identification of a common cause of disease disseminated through complex food distribution networks that cross large geographic areas. The CDC PulseNet, a molecular subtyping surveillance system for food-borne bacterial disease, monitors Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella, Shigella, and Listeria monocytogenes, and other bacterial pathogens8 causing disease throughout the United States. In 2006, clusters of a common E. coli O157:H7 pulsed-field type were observed at several monitoring sites. An investigation revealed the source of the outbreak as prepackaged, fresh spinach. Once the epidemiologic investigation identified spinach, the public was notified and E. coli O157:H7 with the putative pulsed-field type was isolated from an unopened package of spinach from an individual\u2019s home.

Mobile genetic elements that confer resistance can be exchanged between bacteria, even across species, complicating outbreak investigation. Molecular tools can distinguish between a common strain of a single bacterial species or a mobile genetic element conferring antibiotic resistance across strains of the same or even different species. Appropriate intervention should take into account whether a mobile genetic element is being exchanged between species or if there is clonal spread of a single organism. In an outbreak of multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa that occurred in a university hospital in Greece, isolates had a novel gene variant coding for resistance. The outbreak was primarily due to clonal spread of the same strain, but a second strain was found to carry the same novel gene variant, suggesting that some of the outbreak was due to the transfer of resistant genes to sensitive strains.10\n",

Before the availability of modern molecular tools, our ability to empirically estimate transmission probabilities was limited. Although the transmission of a sexually transmitted infection can be estimated by following couples where one is infected and the other is susceptible, without molecular tools, it is difficult to verify that the transmission event came from within the partnership. For respiratory infections, such as pulmonary tuberculosis, our estimates of the transmission probability and natural history have been based on careful documentation of outbreaks. However, as we have been able to type individual strains, we have determined that tuberculosis cases that previously were considered sporadic and not part of apparent time\u2013space clusters (because the exposure to the index case was very limited) were indeed part of the same outbreak.11\n",

The accurate estimation of these parameters assumes that we can distinguish between subtypes (strains) of a microbe. As we have increased our ability to type microbes, we have been forced to re-evaluate many of our previous assumptions, because microbes are much more diverse than previously imagined. One prior key assumption was that pathogens are clonal, that is, during active infection all infecting organisms are the same. Genetic studies have emphasized that bacteria exist in populations; there is enough variability within even a clone that the genomic sequence obtained is an average of the population sequence rather than that of a specific individual.12 Some pathogens, RNA viruses for example, mutate quickly, so that the genetic type of a strain changes over the course of an epidemic, potentially complicating how a case is defined. A second prior assumption was that during an infectious process the pathogenic organism was the one most frequently isolated from the infected site. For many diseases we now know this assumption is false. During a diarrheal episode, the predominant organism isolated from the stool may not be the one causing the symptoms; a toxin-secreting organism occurring at low frequency may be the culprit. For microbes that also are human commensals, such as Streptococcus agalactiae, strains causing disease may be different from normal inhabitants, and different strains may have different transmission systems. A third assumption was that individuals are only infected with one strain of a pathogen. This is also false. Individuals can be concurrently infected with different strains of human papillomavirus (HPV), gonorrhea, and tuberculosis.\n",

For example, if there is a second strain only 5% of the time and the pathogen is uniformly distributed in the sample, we must sample 28 different isolates from an individual to reliably detect the second strain.

Prevalence includes both new and existing cases and can be measured at a single time point (point prevalence) or over a defined period (period prevalence). Incidence can be estimated by following a cohort and measuring the occurrence of new infections during a defined time period. Strain-specific estimates of prevalence and incidence are essential to our understanding of disease etiology, especially if different strains have different propensities to cause diseases. There are many types of HPV; only a few cause cancer. Before the development of the HPV vaccine, the incidence of infection with HPV type 16, which is a type strongly associated with cervical cancer, was estimated by measuring antibody to HPV 16 in the blood (serology). Women were tested for antibodies to HPV type 16 at the time of their first pregnancy and retested at the time of a second pregnancy. Incident cases were all women who tested negative for HPV type 16 during their first pregnancy that tested positive during their second pregnancy.

HIV is diagnosed using a test for host response to infection (antibodies), but antibodies do not appear until several weeks after infection. Once antibodies appear, infection can be diagnosed, but the standard test cannot determine how long it has been since infection occurred, so only prevalent cases are detected. Having a test to detect incident cases would be extremely useful for estimating the rate of ongoing HIV transmission with a single survey or as part of a screening program or intervention trial. Molecular tools have been developed to make this possible, and there are several tests available. After HIV status is identified, an additional test is conducted for a substrate that either is present only in those with recent infection or is a marker of extended infection.14 One such assay uses a branched synthetic peptide (called BED) that enables detection of multiple HIV subtypes; the assay quantitates the proportion of anti-HIV antibody in the serum that increases with time infected. There are still a number of issues with the interpretation of these tests, and it has been noted that biological changes in persons who have been infected for a long time may lead to a high false-positive rate. This is of particular concern in populations with high prevalence. Nonetheless, these tests are an important advance for monitoring HIV and evaluating HIV interventions.14\n",

Many common infections, for example, diarrheal diseases, cause disease in only a subset of all infected, or the disease presentation is sufficiently mild that it does not require medical intervention. However, from a public health perspective it would be extremely useful to know the extent of the population infected, because this would enable a more accurate evaluation of the effectiveness of prevention strategies compared to an assessment based on reduction in the number of outbreaks identified. Refinements of molecular tools combined with statistical approaches make it possible to estimate seroincidence. Seroincidence is the number of infections that lead to seroconversion within a defined time interval. The method uses the distribution of known changes in antibody titer since infection to estimate time since last infection, and then converts the time estimates to incidence. This approach has already been used to estimate seroincidence for Salmonella, a major cause of diarrheal disease.15 Though seroincidence cannot be used to estimate disease burden, because not all infections lead to disease, it does provide a useful estimate of the occurrence of new infections in the population.",

For many pathogens that can cause disease, pathogen presence does not have a one-to-one correspondence with symptoms: the pathogen can be carried asymptomatically. The duration of carriage is important for understanding the transmission system; the duration of disease is useful for estimating disease burden. If duration of carriage is short but incidence is high, an individual might become reinfected with a different strain type, suggesting a longer duration than if strain types were determined. By contrast, if a strain mutates rapidly within the human host, we might underestimate the duration of carriage, an essential parameter for predicting ongoing circulation. Different types of the same species may vary in duration of carriage. S. agalactiae is an emerging pathogen that also frequently colonizes the rectum and the vagina. It has nine known serotypes that are also detected by gene sequence (capsular type). The duration of carriage varies by capsular type, and the duration is longer in women than men, presumably because of affinity of the pathogen for the vaginal cavity.16\n",

If couples carry the identical molecular type of a microbe more frequently than expected based on the population distribution of the microbe, it is strong evidence for sexual transmission.

Using PCR\u2013restriction fragment length polymorphism typing of the porin and opacity genes of Neisseria gonorrhoreae and questionnaire data, a study of successive gonorrhea cases in Amsterstam identified several ongoing transmission chains. The epidemiologic characteristics, including number of sexual partners and choice of same or opposite partners, of patients with different molecular types differed, suggesting that the transmission chains represented different transmission networks.21 Further analysis revealed that the transmission networks for men who have sex with men, and heterosexuals were essentially separate \u2013 a key public health insight for planning interventions. Molecular typing has also improved our understanding of tuberculosis transmission. Until confirmed by molecular typing, tuberculosis was not believed to be transmitted by short-term, casual contact.

Basic epidemiologic methods were essential for tracking the outbreak; a carefully collected epidemiologic case definition was sufficient for case ascertainment, clinical management, infection control, and identification of chains of transmission.34 However, key to characterizing, and ultimately preventing and controlling the outbreak, was the ability to detect mild cases, and confirm that widely disseminated cases were caused by the same pathogen, which required a validated antibody test.35 Early in the epidemic there were many possible candidates identified as the cause, but these microbes were not found in all SARS patients. A variety of state-of-the-art and standard molecular techniques were used to identify the viral agent, a new coronavirus. Molecular techniques established that the coronavirus isolated from SARS cases identified worldwide were caused by the same virus, confirming transmission, and a rapidly developed test demonstrated that SARS patients had antibodies to the new coronavirus. That SARS was a virus newly introduced to humans was confirmed by demonstrating that healthy controls not suffering from SARS had no evidence of either past or present infection.36\n",

Therefore, it is not sufficient to compare genetic sequence, because we anticipate there will be changes in the genetic sequence over time. To make sense of genetic changes requires an analysis that takes into account evolutionary relationships, a field called phylogenetics. Phylogenetics enables epidemiologists to trace the emergence and transmission of a rapidly evolving species and, in an outbreak situation, determine order of transmission. HIV, which causes AIDS, evolves quite rapidly even with a single host. Thus the strain that infects an individual is not genetically identical to the strains that the individual might transmit to others. This property of HIV has made it possible to confirm the deliberate infection of one individual by another using a single blood sample from an individual37 and to gain insight into the spread of HIV worldwide. Not all HIV subtypes spread at the same rate. Using phylogenetic analysis Saad and colleagues38 traced the introduction and spread of HIV in the Ukraine. The analysis revealed that two HIV subtypes introduced into drug networks in the 1990s still contributed to the epidemic in 2001 and 2002; and that one subtype spread widely throughout the Ukraine and into Russia, Moldova, Georgia, Uzbekistan, and Kyrgyzstan. Further studies to determine the biological and social contributions to the success of the one subtype over another will provide important insights into how to control HIV.",

A type of mobile genetic element known as a plasmid can integrate directly into the chromosome or survive as extrachromosomal material in the cytoplasm of bacteria and code for proteins. The recognition of mobile genetic elements and the ability to trace these genetic elements as they move within and between species has caused a rethinking of the rate of and potential for microbial evolution. For example, Shiga toxin\u2013producing E. coli probably emerged from the transfer of genes coding for Shiga toxin from Shigella into E. coli. Antibiotic resistance is often spread via mobile genetic elements, which tend to code for genes providing resistance against multiple antibiotics. This explains several apparent mysteries, such as the spread across many bacterial species within a hospital of the same antibiotic resistance profile, and why treating an individual with one antibiotic can result in resistance to multiple, unrelated antibiotics. Because mobile genetic elements evolve separately from their microbial hosts, separate phylogenies can be constructed, giving insight into the emergence and evolution of these elements.",

Nonculture techniques have enabled us to characterize the microbial communities living in the mouth, gut, vagina, and other body sites, and the detection of microbes in body sites previously thought to be sterile, such as the blood. Epidemiologic data may suggest an infectious origin for a disease; in the past, if an organism could not be cultured, it remained only a suggestion. Molecular tools have changed this by enabling the detection of uncultivable microbes. Two examples of the power of combining epidemiologic principles with molecular techniques are the identification of the causative agent of Kaposi sarcoma, and the identification of HPV as the cause of cervical cancer, which led to the development of an effective vaccine.",

Reasoning that Kaposi sarcoma might be caused by a virus, Chang and associates39 used representative difference analysis, a technique that identifies DNA sequences present in one set of tissue but absent in another, to identify and characterize unique DNA sequences in Kaposi sarcoma tissue that were either absent or present in low copy number in nondiseased tissue obtained from the same patient. Chang and colleagues39 then went on to demonstrate that the sequences, which were similar to herpes virus, were not present in tissue DNA from non-AIDS patients, but were present in AIDS and non-AIDS patients with Kaposi sarcoma worldwide,40., 41. and that infection with the virus preceded development of the sarcoma.42., 43.\n",

HPV was a suspected cause of genital cancer, because \u2013 similar to Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma \u2013 the epidemiology suggested that an infectious agent was involved. However, other genital infections, particularly herpes simplex virus, were also suspects. HPV had been ruled out by many, but a new molecular technique, the hybridization assay, detected in cancerous tissue a new subtype, HPV 16, which was specifically associated with cervical and other cancers.44 The association of HPV 16 with cancer was confirmed by comparing presence of HPV 16 among cancer patients to controls. Though this evidence can be very suggestive, it does not demonstrate temporal order, because the cancer might have preceded HPV 16 infection. Demonstrating temporal order required large-scale prospective cohort studies. These studies also provided key insights supporting the possibility that HPV could be prevented by vaccination, because reinfection with the same HPV subtype rarely occurred, and antibody could protect against reinfection and persistence of low-grade lesions.45\n",

(For a listing, see the website, Pathogen Genomics, at http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Projects/Pathogens.46) Unlike genes from multicellular organisms, single-celled organisms often vary greatly in genetic content and expression \u2013 that is, genes may be present or absent as well as expressed or silent. Once a single strain of a microbe has been sequenced, the sequence can be used as a reference for comparison with others in the same species, providing insight into the heterogeneity of the species. Sequence information can be mined for potential virulence genes, by identifying genes of unknown function with structures similar to genes whose function is known in the same or other species. However, until the presence or expression of the gene is associated with transmission, pathogenesis, or virulence at a population level, the relative importance of a particular gene cannot be discerned. A gene that is associated with virulence in the laboratory may occur so rarely in vivo that it is an inappropriate target for vaccination or therapeutics. Epidemiologic screening of collections of human pathogens for the prevalence of genes that alter the transmission, pathogenesis, and virulence of the microbe provides insight into the potential importance and putative function of genes identified using genomic analyses. A gene found more frequently in strains that cause severe disease (virulent strains) than among strains that colonize without causing symptoms (commensal strains) suggests that the gene is worthy of more detailed laboratory analyses of its function. A genomic subtraction of a Haemophilus influenzae causing middle ear infection (otitis media) from a laboratory strain of H. influenzae identified several genes found only in middle ear isolates. Upon screening of collections of human isolates, one gene, lic2B, occurred 3.7 times more frequently among middle ear than colonizing isolates, suggesting that lic2B is involved in the pathogenesis of otitis media.47\n",
