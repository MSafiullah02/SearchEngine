Nevertheless, it has been hypothesized that virus interference might lead to a correlation between receipt of influenza vaccination and increased risk of infection with other respiratory viruses. We investigated whether such a phenomenon might affect a study design commonly used to estimate influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE). We searched publications in MEDLINE, PubMed, and Web of Science. We identified 12 studies using the test-negative design (2011-2017) that reported VE estimates separately derived by 3 alternative control groups: 1) all patients testing negative for influenza (FLU), VE FLU\u2212 ; 2) patients who tested positive for other/another respiratory virus (ORV), VE ORV+ ; and 3) patients who tested negative for all viruses in the panel (PAN), VE PAN\u2212 . These included VE estimates from 7 countries for all age groups from 2003/2004 to 2013/2014. We observed no difference in vaccination coverage between the ORV-positive and PAN-negative control groups. A total of 63 VE FLU\u2212 estimates, 62 VE ORV+ estimates, and 33 VE PAN\u2212 estimates were extracted. Pooled estimates of the difference in VE (\u0394VE) were very similar between groups. In meta-regression, no association was found between the selection of control group and VE estimates. In conclusion, we did not find any differences in VE estimates based on the choice of control group. epidemiologic methods; influenza; test-negative design; vaccine effectiveness; virus interference Abbreviations: CI, confidence interval; ED, emergency department; ORV, other/another respiratory virus; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; RSV, respiratory syncytial virus; TND, test-negative design; VE, vaccine effectiveness.",

Influenza vaccines generally have moderate-to-good efficacy, estimated to fall within the range of 60%-70% in children and 50%-60% in adults based on randomized controlled trials (1, 2) . However, influenza vaccine efficacy and vaccine effectiveness (VE) can vary from year to year depending on the degree of antigenic match between strains selected for inclusion in the vaccine and circulating strains, as well as the intervals between vaccination and influenza epidemics (3) . VE can also vary among subpopulations-persons of different ages, for example (4, 5) . These factors may affect both experimental and observational study designs. Thus, annual estimates of influenza VE can provide ongoing evidence on the performance of influenza vaccines in the community.",

The test-negative design (TND) has been widely applied for measuring influenza VE on a routine basis in Europe, North America, Australia, and Asia since 2005 (6, 7) . In this study design, patients with signs and symptoms meeting predefined clinical definitions (e.g., acute respiratory infection or influenzalike illness) are swabbed and tested for influenza viruses. In some cases, testing may be done against a panel of respiratory viruses. Persons testing positive are defined as cases, while those testing negative for influenza viruses (influenza (FLU)-negative) are classified as controls. Persons who test negative may test positive for another respiratory virus (other/another respiratory virus (ORV)-positive) or may test negative for all viruses in the panel (panel (PAN)-negative). VE is estimated as VE% = 1 \u2212 OR adj , where OR adj is the odds ratio comparing the odds of vaccination among cases with the odds of vaccination among the controls, adjusted for potential confounders such as age. This design can be embedded within existing surveillance systems to enable timely estimation of VE in both inpatient and outpatient settings at a reasonable cost (8, 9) .",

Furthermore, if this population were more likely to receive influenza vaccination than the source population, selection bias would be introduced. Nevertheless, in a meta-analysis comparing inpatient and outpatient VE, Feng et al. (13) observed similar VE estimates by setting when the analysis was restricted to the same season, country, and age group. In a simulation study examining the validity of the TND for inpatient settings, Foppa et al. (14) concluded that VE estimates would be biased if chronic respiratory conditions were not well-controlled in the analysis. Under this assumption, vaccination coverage and VE estimates might differ according to different control groups; that is, higher vaccination coverage, and thus higher VE estimates, would be observed with the use of PAN-negative controls.",

This would result in higher influenza vaccination coverage among controls with ORVs detected than in controls with no virus detected. Therefore, selection of controls could then lead to biased estimation of VE; that is, the VE estimates derived using the ORV-positive group would be higher than those for the PAN-negative group and the FLU-negative group. Simulation studies have suggested that while this phenomenon can produce biased estimates, that bias is trivial except under extreme conditions (22) . However, simulations are often simplistic representations of real studies and may not be able to capture the nuances of immunological phenomena. For example, immunological responses may be less apparent in the elderly than in children or young adults, possibly because of immunosenescence (23) . Thus, any evaluation of the potential bias caused by virus interference should consider the age of the population.",

Following the previous search strategies, papers were searched on PubMed (National Library of Medicine, Bethesda, Maryland), MEDLINE (National Library of Medicine), and Web of Science (Clarivate Analytics, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania) for the following combination of keywords: 1) \"influenza\" or \"flu\"; 2) \"vaccine effectiveness\" or \"VE\"; 3) \"test-negative\" or \"test negative\" or \"case-control\" or \"case control\"; and 4) sets 1, 2, and 3. Articles were independently screened by 2 of the authors (S.F. and S.G.S.). Studies estimating influenza VE for any season, any influenza type/subtype, or any type of influenza vaccination by VE were considered. Only articles published in English were considered. Studies or subanalyses of studies which reanalyzed previously published data, reported interim estimates, or did not use the TND were excluded. All studies meeting these inclusion criteria were further screened and were included if influenza VE was estimated using alternative control groups, including FLU-negative, ORV-positive, and/ or PAN-negative controls.",

To further examine whether any study design feature was associated with VE estimates, we also conducted meta-regression by means of univariate and multivariate random-effects models. The predictors included age group (children, adults, elderly, and all ages), study setting (inpatient/outpatient/mixed), season (single/multiple), restriction of patients to those presenting for health care within 4 days (yes/no), exclusive use of polymerase chain reaction (PCR)/reverse transcription PCR for testing (yes/no), number of ORVs tested, and type of control group (FLU-negative, ORV-positive, or PAN-negative).

Seven also reported VE estimates obtained using PAN-negative controls (25, 26, 29, (32) (33) (34) (35) . All studies performed PCR/reverse transcription PCR for influenza diagnosis among all patients or in a subset of patients. Some studies also used immunofluorescence and/or virus culture (24, 25, 27, 28) (Table 1 ). The number of ORVs included in the respiratory panels ranged from 3 to 8. All included studies tested for RSV. Other commonly included viruses were human metapneumovirus (n = 9 studies), adenovirus (n = 8), and rhinovirus (n = 9) ( Table 1) . Only 2 studies reported the number of specimens testing positive for each ORV tested (33, 34) . In these 2 studies, the most commonly detected ORVs were RSV and rhinovirus, accounting for 66.5% (34) and 73.1% (33) of total ORVs detected, respectively. There was a weak negative correlation between the number of ORVs included in the panel and the proportion of patients identified as PAN-negative (r = -0.37), but this was not statistically significant (P = 0.13). The proportion of controls identified as PAN-negative was lowest among children: 17.3% in 1 US study (32), 26.8% in 1 Australian study conducted in an ED (24) , and 21.3% from another Australian study conducted in an outpatient setting (27) ( Table 2) . The proportion of patients testing positive for ORVs in the FLUnegative group ranged from 13.5% among people aged \u226510 years in Japan (33) to 80.2% among children aged 6-59 months in the United States (32) . The interquartile range was 27.5%-45.5% for all studies (Table 2) .",

(32) reported results by age group, we were able to calculate estimates for a total of 18 triplets from 12 studies ( Table 2 ). The vaccination coverage estimated from the FLU-negative group ranged from 9.0% among inpatient children aged 6 months-17 years in Hong Kong, China, in 2009-2013 (25) to 68.3% among outpatient children aged 6 months-5 years in Australia in 2008 (27) . The differences in vaccination coverage between the ORV-positive and PAN-negative groups ranged from \u221228.4% to 16.0% (Table 2 ). However, the paired t test comparing mean vaccination coverage between these groups suggested no statistical difference (P = 0.61). Of 18 differences in vaccination coverage point estimates, 6 were higher than 10%. We did not identify any age-or setting-specific pattern larger or smaller than 10% by univariate analysis.",

Among the 63 VE FLU\u2212 estimates, 38 estimates were for persons of all ages, 18 were for children, and 4 were specifically for older adults; 44 were estimates of VE against influenza A or B viruses, while others were calculated for a specific influenza type/ subtype (Web Figures 1 and 2) . All studies estimated VE after adjusting for potential confounders, including age, and 9 in 12 adjusted for calendar time as a proxy for changing influenza activity. We calculated \u0394VE FLU\u2212,ORV+ , \u0394VE FLU\u2212,PAN\u2212 , and \u0394VE ORV+,PAN\u2212 from each available estimate.

The 48 point estimates of \u0394VE FLU\u2212,ORV+ ranged from -43% to 18%. Forty of these estimates had an absolute value of less than 10% (Web Figure 1) . The VE estimates excluded from meta-analysis are shown in Web Figure 2 . In the meta-analysis, we removed pooled \u0394VE estimates if \u0394VE estimates by age stratum/influenza season were available (n = 21) and estimated pooled \u0394VE FLU\u2212,ORV+ against influenza A or B viruses. I 2 and Cochran's Q test implied no concerning heterogeneity (I 2 = 0, were not included. e There were 4 subjects in the ORV-positive control group and 18 subjects in the PAN-negative control group with missing data on vaccination status. Persons with missing vaccination status were not excluded; their vaccination status was categorized as \"unknown,\" and they were included in the analysis. Q(20 df) = 8.4, P = 0.99). The pooled \u0394VE FLU\u2212,ORV+ was -4% (95% confidence interval (CI): -10, 2) as estimated from 21 pairs of differences in VE estimates (\u0394VE FLU\u2212 and \u0394VE ORV+ ), consistent with no substantial difference for VE estimates between the FLU-negative and ORV-positive groups. Similarly, the pooled estimate for \u0394VE FLU\u2212,PAN\u2212 was -1% (95% CI: -8, 5) (n = 13), and that for \u0394VE ORV+,PAN\u2212 was 5% (95% CI: -2, 12) (n = 13).

However, our analysis did not strongly support this hypothesis; although age group was correlated with VE estimates, we did not observe an interaction between any age groups and choices of control groups in multivariate metaregression.

However, we identified no statistically significant \u0394VE estimates among types/subtypes. Again, our analysis of these effects was limited by the sample size.

However, we only observed a nonsignificant, weak, negative correlation between the number of ORVs tested and the proportion PANnegative. The types of viruses included in the panel may also affect the proportion PAN-negative. For example, in the 2 studies reporting the detection rates of each ORV, rhinovirus and RSV were most commonly detected. Only 1 study from Hong Kong (25) did not include rhinovirus, which could explain why this study had the highest proportion PAN-negative. The differences in proportion PAN-negative are likely to also be associated with viral load and shedding. With the exception of the Hong Kong study (25) , the studies involving children presented low proportions of PAN-negative subjects among all eligible subjects, which is consistent with observations of higher viral load and shedding from children (37) . The heterogeneity of viral shedding by age suggests potential misclassification bias in the PAN-negative group, where results may be more likely to be false-negative among samples taken from older patients. Other reasons for false-negative influenza results may be associated with suboptimal swab quality, imperfect laboratory testing methods, or long intervals from symptom onset to presentation (11) . All of these factors could contribute to misclassification of infection status and contribute to larger \u0394VE ORV+,PAN\u2212 values. Under this circumstance, the ORV-positive group could be considered the one providing more accurate VE estimates, because it demonstrates that the swab and swabbing method were of sufficient quality to detect virus (28) .",

Using FLU-negative controls is likely to produce VE estimates that are as reliable as those of ORV-positive and PAN-negative controls. From a resource-saving perspective, investigators in surveillance systems or research schemes using the TND to measure influenza VE may consider not testing further for ORVs when estimating influenza VE. Further simulation studies that incorporate multiple sources of bias and examine this phenomenon in different age groups could help confirm or refute our findings.",
