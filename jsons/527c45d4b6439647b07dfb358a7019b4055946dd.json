Like anxiety and depression, hazardous drinking increased to 29.1 %, harmful drinking increased to 9.5 % and alcohol dependency reached to 1.6 %. Table 2 also showed that approximately one-third people (32.1 %) were in lower mental well-being. Table 3 shows that proportion of having different levels of anxiety (\u03c7 2 = 4.340, p = .227, effect size = .064) and mental wellbeing (\u03c7 2 = 3.874, p = .144, effect size = .060) of people from Hubei and other provinces nearly equal. However, there existed significant differences in depression (\u03c7 2 = 11.908, p = .008, effect size = .105) and alcohol abuse (\u03c7 2 = 30.772, p < .001, effect size = .169) between respondents from Hubei and other provinces. Although, proportions for mild and moderate depression were equal for both Hubei and other provinces, but, proportion of severe depression were more than twice for people from Hubei province than other provinces. Proportions of both harmful and hazardous users and alcohol dependent users were much higher for people from Hubei than other provinces. Table 4 shows significant interaction of gender to alcohol abuse (\u03c7 2 = 19.696, p < .001, effect size = .135). Ratio of harmful users and dependent users for males were six times higher than females. Table 4 also shows non-significant interaction of gender with anxiety, depression, and mental wellbeing. Table 5 shows significant interaction of age groups to anxiety (\u03c7 2 = 39.484, p < .001, effect size = .192), depression (\u03c7 2 = 38.830, p < .001, effect size = .190) and mental wellbeing (\u03c7 2 = 21.259, p = .006, effect size = .141). Proportion of having different level of anxiety and depression, and lower mental wellbeing were relatively higher among 21\u221230 years age group. Total 27.3 % and 46 % were identified as having different level of anxiety and depression, and 37.6 % having lower mental wellbeing. This group is more vulnerable in their mental health status during the outbreak of the COVID-19. Even, 12.4 % respondents of this age group were harmful alcohol users. Beside this age group, proportion of different level of anxiety (24.9 %) and depression (36.8 %), and lower mental wellbeing (30 %) of 31\u221240 years age group also relatively higher.",

Since the COVID-19 outbreak is very new, so there is very little literature on the psychological impact of this outbreak. The present study rapidly assessed the prevalence of psychological problems associated with people's incarceration to the COVID-19 epidemic in China through an online survey. The results of this study have suggested a much higher rate of anxiety, depression, alcohol consumptions and lower mental wellbeing among Chinese people due to COVID-19 outbreak and their confinement in their home as the first-line response to the epidemic or public health emergency. Comparing the present study findings with the cross-sectional epidemiological study of Huang et al. (2019) , Chinese people's mental well-being is deteriorating. Liu et al. (2020) cited a survey, included medical staffs only, that suggested higher prevalence rate of depression (50.7 %), anxiety (44.7 %), insomnia (36.1 %), and stress related symptoms (73.4 %). This higher rate of mental health problems might be due to the ambiguity and little information about the COVID-19. Usually, at early stages of a pandemic, people have little information about nature, treatment, fatality rate, etc. that fuel the fear about the organism. Xiang et al. (2020) have opined that quarantine can induce loneliness, boredom, anger, anxiety, and depression.",

WHO (February 28, 2020b) stated that the overall fatality rate differed by location (i.e. 5.8 % in Wuhan, main city of the Hubei province, and .7% in other provinces). There might be a connection of higher fatality rate due to the COVID-19 and higher rate of depression and alcohol consumptions among people from Hubei province. Regarding gender differences, male were higher in alcohol consumptions than female. Studies suggested that females are twice higher in stress and anxiety related problems (Foa and Street, 2001; Kessler et al., 1994 Kessler et al., , 1995 Kessler et al., , 2005 . But, this non-significant gender differences in anxiety suggested that both men and women equally concerned about the COVID-19 and its further consequences. Regarding alcohol consumption, the rate of harmful alcohol use and dependence by women was not increased much than earlier (.2% and 1% respectively, WHO, 2018), where the alcohol abuse rate much higher among men than earlier (8.4 % and 4.4 % respectively, WHO, 2018) .",

Moreover, self-report data are subjected to social desirability bias. As COVID-19 epidemic gets huge attention by the world, social desirability bias might present in the data. Second, more than 50 % participants were from Wuhan province, the epicentre of COVID-19. This might question the representativeness of the study sample. Third, the data for the present study were collected through the Chinese online platform 'Tencent'. There is a possibility to provide irrational and misleading feedbacks.",
