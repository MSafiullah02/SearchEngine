Quality of water is negatively affected by contamination of various pollutants. Various types of physical, chemical, and biological pollutants emerge from different sources and they deteriorate respective qualities of water. Physical property of water includes electrical conductivity, total dissolved solids, and suspended solids. Chemical property is given by composition of various minerals, carbon content, dissolved oxygen, and nitrogen and phosphorus (Christensen et al., 2015). Biological property refers to presence of various types of microbes and pathogens, especially viruses, bacteria, algae, protozoan, nematodes, insects, and their propagules. Waterborne diseases are any sickness caused by drinking of water polluted with pathogenic microorganisms. There are a variety of pathogenic microorganisms which can cause various types of illness in humans (Table 10.1\n).",

Stormwater is a kind of raw water formed by natural contamination of pollutants in rain-catchment areas like agricultural field, pond, and forest, etc. (Rippy, 2015). Other examples of raw water are groundwater abstracted through borehole, rivers, natural and man-made lakes, and reservoirs. The raw water can be supplied for potable use after simple filtration steps and disinfection. After domestic or industrial usage, water is discharged in sewage system. This water, burdened with pollutants and pathogenic microbes, is called as wastewater. Domestic wastewater is categorized as graywater and blackwater. Graywater is generated from kitchen, laundry, and washrooms, while blackwater includes human excreta, i.e., feces and urine discharged from toilets. Well-engineered wastewater treatment plant and zero-energy constructed wetlands (CWs) are employed to treat domestic wastewater and the treated water can be discharged back to waterbodies (Lee and Scholz, 2006).",

Domestic sewage is rich in organic content, and thus it contains large number of waterborne pathogens. Hospital sewage is a complex mixture containing sewage and wastewater resulting from the cleaning of laboratories, patient ward, and other facilities. As antibiotics and disinfectants are the major constituents of hospital wastewater, occurrence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria is more prevalent (Pauwels and Verstraete, 2006, Jury et al., 2010). Industrial wastewaters are generated through different industrial activities such as chemical, electrochemical, electronic, petrochemical, and food processing industries. Lack of infrastructure in water distribution system to households also plays an important role in providing clean drinking water. In several cases, drinking water supply pipes are situated close to the blackwater supply pipes. Due to this exceedingly connected piping network, at a time pressure in water supply pipe can be negative or positive relative to the surrounding water. Therefore, in a leaky water distribution system, surrounding chemical and microbial contaminants can easily be mixed with the drinking water supply. A broad range of decentralized and centralized treatment options are available for sewage water. Treated water showed limited growth of microorganisms because of low nutrient levels, and further treatment through disinfectants such as chlorination and ultraviolet (UV) treatment can convert the water in portable form. Although in potable water distribution systems, biofilms are ubiquitously formed and provide a constant source of heterotrophic bacteria (Waluyo, 2017).",

While the presence of heterotroph does not in itself constitute a human health hazard, they can serve as a means to assess the microbiological quality of the water and the effectiveness of water treatment (Chen et al., 2015). A large number of process methodologies are in progress for removing or inactivating waterborne pathogens. Chlorination is the most common method of disinfection of potable water, but it is found less effective for Cryptosporidium and thus presents a challenge for its removal from water. The emerging number of resistant microbial strains toward the commonly applied physical and chemical disinfection methods and microbial composition of water are key factors to determine the transmission of emerging waterborne diseases. Thus, treatment technologies should be evaluated according to water quality, quantity, and effectiveness because extensive use of chlorine and chloramines promotes biofilm-forming populations including Mycobacterium. Increased number of adenovirus was reported in surface water treated with UV light. Waterborne pathogens such as Naegleria causing fatal infection showed resistant to chlorine disinfectants and UV light (Horn et al., 2016).",

Biofilm formation in water transport pipes contributes to the occurrence of heterotrophic bacterial populations in water. Prevention of biofilm formation seems almost impossible because of the rapid microbial attachment on moist surfaces and their fast rate of growth. For the removal of established biofilm, harsh treatment methods such as oxidizing biocides can be applied. The increased uses of antimicrobial chemicals result in emergence of resistant bacteria, which requires new treatment strategies for their control. Thus, for removing such diverse categories of waterborne pathogens, some new targeted, cost-effective, and environment-friendly biological solutions such as enzymes, phages, interspecies interactions, and antimicrobial molecules of microbial origin can be used (Fig. 10.1\n) (Corre et al., 2018; Waluyo, 2017).",

It is an eco-friendly and economically viable approach for enhanced degradation of pollutants by addition of pregrown microbe or microbial cocultures in the medium. Microorganisms from different ecological conditions and engineered microbes capable to produce versatile enzymes are added to native microbial population for in situ treatment of contaminated site. Many refractory pollutants such as halogenated organics, aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbons, pesticides, and pharmaceutical products have emerged out in municipal, hospital, industrial, and agricultural effluents in recent time (Herrero and Stuckey, 2015). Presence of pollutants such as chlorinated and fluorinated compounds, lignin, cyanides, synthetic dyes, polyaromatic hydrocarbons, carbamate, chloroacetamide, and benzimidazole limits bioremediation of industrial wastewater because of its toxicity to native microbial community, less solubility, high stability, and poor bioavailability. Augmentation of pollutant-specific microbial cultures intensifies degradation process by circumvention of aforesaid limitations (Herrero and Stuckey, 2015).",

A proteolytic enzyme in combination of surfactants improves the removal of biofilm as surfactant dissolves the biofilm matrix and proteolytic enzymes lyse the microbes staying there (Ben Saad et al., 2019). In every ecosystem, bacterial population is naturally controlled by bacteriophages (phages). Phages are viruses that infect, replicate, and kill bacteria. Phages provide a species targeted way to eradicate biofilms from pipes. Biofilms are composed of a mixture of bacterial species, so the application of phages has many challenges. Introduction of microbial metabolites is also a related approach for the treatment of complex interlinked network of bacterial species in biofilms. This method depends upon antagonism for substrate that can change the equilibrium of species in the biofilm (Jassim et al., 2016).",

In addition, many antimicrobial peptides were found capable of killing Legionella sp. (Berjeaud et al., 2016). It is clear from above studies that the sensitivity of L. pneumophila to a variety of biomolecules is inadequately understood because of the lack of mechanistic data. Some Pseudomonas strains releasing volatile organic compound (VOC) showed anti-Legionella properties. These strains inhibited the growth of L. pneumophila through VOC.

A paper disk method was used to find potential heterotrophic detergent-tolerant strains against pathogenic bacteria. Heterotrophic bacteria produce certain compounds, found lethal against pathogenic bacteria. These compounds can remove the pathogens by different ways such as affecting cell wall, disturbing cell membrane function, and inhibiting protein and nucleic acid synthesis. Waluyo (2017) has identified four potent bacterial species for detergent-tolerant and antagonistic toward pathogen. These isolates are Bacillus thuringiensis strain MSS-2, Bacillus cereus strain BQAR-01, Bacillus cereus strain JDA-1, and Bacillus sp. B31.

According to WEF (2015) announcement, water crisis is the number one global risk, based on impact to society, and is number eight based on likelihood of occurring within 10 years (Weinbauer, 2004). Throughout the world, there are 750 million people who lack access to safe water. In developing countries, more than 1.5 million children died because of waterborne bacterial infections each year (Fenwick, 2006). Hunter (2003) reported that in Asian and African countries, the mortality due to contaminated drinking water exceeds 5 million people per year; and children under 5 years of age are the most affected by microbial diseases transmitted through water (Seas et al., 2000). More than 50% of drinking water\u2013associated diseases are microbial intestinal infections, among which cholera is the most occurring. Sewage coming from human populations or from livestock is the primary source of pathogenic microorganisms in drinking and recreational water. Therefore, maximum risk for pathogenic microorganism contamination in drinking water is associated with the sewage mixing; it can occur through mixing of drinking water supply with sewage transport system (Jassim and Limoges, 2014). In recent years because of the extensive increase in antibiotic-resistant bacteria stains exploitation of phages as biocontrol agent attracts considerable attention. Phages have many features that make them a suitable biocontrol agent. These consist of their effectiveness in killing their target bacteria, specificity, adaptivity, ability to survive in harsh environmental conditions, and the fact that they are self-replicating and self-limiting (Jassim et al., 2016).\n",

This method could be useful for designing the treatment approach for removing pathogenic bacteria from wastewater. Strategy of wastewater treatment through phages requires the initial characterization for occurrence of pathogenic bacteria. Therefore, the first treatment approach should be identification of pathogenic bacteria from wastewater and isolation and enrichment of lytic phages against these species. This phage-mediated elimination of bacteria has the competence to control treatment performance by regulating the abundance of pathogenic bacteria (Periasamy and Sundaram, 2013). Many workers suggested the application of phages directly in wastewater treatment system. In this regard, many studies projected the use of specific phage as an eco-friendly approach for removing filamentous foaming bacteria in activated sludge process system. Several phages showing lytic cycle can potentially be exploited as biocontrol agent for pathogenic bacteria. These studies have concluded that treatment of sewage with phages provides a cost-effective and sustainable method for killing pathogenic bacteria (e.g., E. coli and Salmonella) (Jassim et al., 2016).",

Bacterial species found in the rhizospheric region of CWs have the potential to show antagonism against human pathogenic bacteria. Functioning of CWs in terms of waterborne pathogen removal depends upon the potential antagonistic heterotrophic bacterial species. These types of bacterial species can be isolated from different ecological niches and screened to lab scale and then inoculated in CWs to improve the functioning of these engineered systems. Ben Saad et al. (2019) reported control of S. typhi ATCC 560 by antagonistic bacteria inhabited in rhizosphere of P. australis planted in horizontal subsurface flow CW system. In another study, water and rhizospheric soil samples were collected from different components in the CWs (Ben Saad et al., 2016). After sampling, isolation, and purification, strains were screened for specific functions such as plant growth promoting by siderophore production, bacterial motility, biofilm production, and antagonist activity against waterborne human pathogenic bacteria. For colonization on plant roots, biofilm formation is important along epidermal tissue. Antagonist test of isolated strains was performed against human pathogenic bacteria S. typhi. The microorganism producing broad range of lytic agents, antimicrobial compounds, antibiotics, bacteriocins, exotoxin proteins, and secondary metabolites showed accomplishment in antagonistic activities. Therefore, these selected bacterial strains have been used to control the density of pathogenic bacteria and improve the water treatment in CWs. This study showed that specific bioinoculation can potentially enhance the pathogenic bacteria removal process. It is an eco-friendly approach to improve water treatment process by CWs, and it highlighted the fact that bioaugmentation can provide a better pathogen removal efficiency (Ben Saad et al., 2019).\n",
