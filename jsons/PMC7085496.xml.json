On the basis of genomic structures and phylogenetic relationship, the subfamily Coronavirinae comprises of four genera Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Gammacoronavirus and Deltacoronavirus [1]. The transmission of alphacoronaviruses and betacoronaviruses are limited to mammals and causes respiratory illness in humans such as SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), whereas the gammacoronaviruses and deltacoronaviruses infect birds as well as infect mammals [2]. Coronaviruses have the largest RNA genome of 26\u201332 kilobases (kb) with positive sense. The genome encodes four major structural proteins including spike (S), nucleocapsid (N), membrane (M) and envelope (E) which required to make complete virus particle [3]. Upon entry into host cells, the viral genome translates into two large precursor polyproteins namely as pp1a and pp1ab which get processed into 16 mature nonstructural proteins (nsp1-nsp16) by ORF 1a-encoded viral proteinases, 3C-like proteinases (3CLpro) and papain-like proteinase (PLpro). These nonstructural proteins (nsps) perform crucial function during viral RNA replication and transcription [4]. RNA recombination without proof-reading mechanism among the existing coronaviruses is mostly responsible for the evolution and emergence of novel coronaviruses [5]. The frequency of recombination has been proposed to be higher in the S gene which codes for viral spike (S) glycoprotein.",

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), as of 11th February 2020, a total of 43,103 cases have been confirmed with 1018 deaths with case fatality rate of 2.36%. Around 42,708 cases and 1017 deaths were reported from China alone. In addition to China, other South-East Asian countries including Singapore, Thailand, Republic of Korea, Japan, Taiwan, Malaysia, Vietnam, India, Philippines, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Cambodia have reported cases of 2019-nCoV. Moreover, countries like United Arab Emirates, Germany, France, United Kingdom, Italy, Spain, Russia, Sweden, Finland, Belgium, USA, Canada and Australia have also reported with 2019-nCoV cases [6]. However, the route of transmission of 2019-nCoV has not been yet identified. The average age of the patients reported with 2019-nCoV infection is 56 years where more than 50% of the cases are from men. Health care professionals and hospitalized patients are at the highest risk for the 2019-nCoV transmission. Patients were mainly reported with pneumonia like symptoms as fever, fatigue, dry cough, lymphopenia, elevated level of lactate dehydrogenase and prolonged prothrombin time. In addition, patients had difficulty in breathing where chest radiographs showing bilateral patchy shadows, or ground glass opacity in all patients including invasive pneumonic infiltrates in few cases [7, 8].",

To characterize the virus and its genetic material, bronchoalveolar lavage was performed in few patients and the collected fluid samples or cultured viruses were used for next-generation sequencing. All the samples have been found to be closely related to bat SARS-like Betacoronavirus [9]. The sequenced virus \u201cWuhan seafood market pneumonia virus isolates Wuhan-Hu-1\u201d of 29,875 bp ss-RNA with the accession number of MN908947 is available on NCBI database [10]. The length of the 2019-nCoV encoded proteins were found to be almost similar among 2019-nCoV and bat SARS-like coronaviruses. However, a notable difference was found in the longer spike protein of 2019-nCoV when compared with the bat SARS-like coronaviruses and SARS-CoV [9].",

            "text": "The infection of coronavirus is initiated via the interaction of viral envelope with host cellular membrane [11]. The internalization of virus also depends upon the potential glycosylation sites present on viral glycoprotein. Viral envelope comprises of three proteins where spike (S) and membrane (M) are the two major glycoproteins and envelope (E) is the non-glycosylated protein. The M protein comprises of short N-terminal glycosylated ectodomain with three transmembrane domains (TM) and a long C-terminal CT domain [12]. The M and E proteins are required for virus morphogenesis, assembly and budding. S glycoprotein is a type 1 fusion viral protein that comprises of two heptad repeat regions known as HR-C and HR-N which forms the coiled-coil structures surrounded by protein ectodomain [13]. S protein cleaved into two subunits S1 and S2 where S1 comprises of minimal receptor-binding domain (270\u2013510) that helps in receptor binding and S2 facilitates membrane fusion [14]. S protein is crucial for receptor binding, membrane fusion, internalization of the virus, tissue tropism and host range and therefore is the crucial targets for vaccine development [15]. Therefore, in the present study we analyzed the S glycoprotein of 2019-nCoV considering its importance for virus attachment to the host cell receptor and compared it with its predecessor reference SARS-CoV strain for sequence variation, glycosylation pattern, structural and antigenic divergence for a better understanding of viral pathogenesis and antigenicity.",

The management of 2019-nCoV human infections depends on characteristics of the virus, including the transmission capability, the severity of resulting infection, and availability of vaccines or medicines to control the impact of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Coronaviruses are zoonotic in nature that means they transmit from animals to humans [26]. However, the exact source of 2019-nCoV has not been yet identified. The evolution of 2019-nCoV may be the result of RNA recombination among the viruses as previously reported in the case of SZ3 strain of SARS-CoV which arose from the recombination of existing Rf4092 and WIV16 bat strains. Likewise, the WIV16 bat strains generated likely from the two other prevalent bat SARS-CoV strains [27]. The most frequent breakpoint for recombination exist in the S gene of coronavirus that encodes for spike (S) protein which comprises of minimal-binding domain and orf8 upstream that encodes an accessory protein [28]. Considering the prevalence and large genetic diversity of existing coronaviruses, their close proximity and frequent recombination has expected the emergence of novel variants. Our phylogenetic analysis revealed that a 2019-nCoV arises from the predecessors strains of SARS-coronaviruses.",
