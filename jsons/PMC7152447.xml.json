It may also originate from presinusoidal or sinusoidal increased in hydrostatic pressure (e.g., portal hypertension, lymphatic obstruction). Modified transudates are associated with an increased posthepatic hydrostatic pressure (i.e., heart failure) or vascular permeability (e.g., vasculitis, lung lobe torsion, diaphragmatic hernia) causing leakage of a higher protein ultrafiltrate.8, 21 However, in animals with chronic effusion, irritation of the pleura may cause an increased nucleated cell count and water can be reabsorbed in excess of protein and cells, thus increasing the cell count and protein concentration.6 Translocation of abdominal effusion, neoplastic effusion, and chylothorax are other causes of transudates or modified transudates.",

Pending culture and susceptibility testing results, broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotic therapy, such as enrofloxacin for gram-negative bacteria and ampicillin with sulbactam or ticarcillin with clavulanate for gram-positive and anaerobic infections,38 should be instituted as soon as possible. However, an increasing resistance of E. coli to enrofloxacin has been documented and amikacin and ceftizoxime have shown to have better efficacy against this organism.35 Clindamycin is also effective against many of the offending organisms in cats. Medical management with thoracostomy tubes (bilateral in most cases) is recommended, and sterile lavage with warm physiologic saline (10 to 20 ml/kg q6-12h daily) may be used initially if the effusion is thick and flocculent (see Chapter 199). Absorbed lavage solution by the inflamed pleura can lead to fluid overload, so close monitoring of fluid \u201cins and outs\u201d is recommended. The use of pleural lavage with heparin may improve outcome in dogs with pyothorax treated with thoracostomy tubes by decreasing adhesion within the pleural space.33 Intermittent thoracocentesis is not a recommended means of drainage and is associated with high mortality in both cats and dogs.16, 33 Tubes will often be necessary for 4 to 6 days 28, 34, 36 and removal is based on daily fluid reevaluation and the quantity of fluid produced (<2.2 ml/kg per tube q24h, although this can vary depending on the severity of pleuritis).30 Thoracic radiographs or ultrasonographic examination should be used to monitor the efficacy of drainage. A thoracotomy with or without pneumonectomy should be performed if compartmentalized fluid, lung or pleural abscess, foreign body, perforated esophagus, thoracic wall lesion, or neoplasia is suspected or if medical management is failing.33, 39 Thoracoscopy is an alternative to thoracotomy in certain cases and should be consider as it is associated with lower morbidity and complication rate.32\n",

Multiple surgical interventions have been described; however, a combination of thoracic duct ligation with subphrenic pericardectomy has become the most successful procedure and is often performed via thoracotomy or thoracoscopy.43, 45, 46 Long-term recovery rates vary from 73% to 100%.45, 46, 47 The placement of pleural access ports at the time of surgery enable aspiration of pleural fluid by veterinary staff and owners after surgery and can allow animals with slowly resolving effusion to go home for continued postoperative care.

Only sufficient blood should be retrieved from the pleural space to relieve dyspnea and allow adequate oxygenation because the red blood cells that remain will be reabsorbed over the ensuing several days. Autotransfusion should be considered in trauma patients if more than 10 ml/kg of effusion is present.49 Thoracostomy tube placement should be considered if the animal cannot be stabilized with thoracocentesis and the hemorrhage is ongoing (see Chapter 199). Surgery is rarely indicated in animals with a traumatic hemothorax unless a penetrating injury or uncontrollable hemorrhage is present but is often necessary for noncoagulopathic spontaneous hemothoraces.",

Common primary thoracic cancers include mesothelioma, pulmonary carcinomas, and lymphosarcoma, but metastatic disease can also result in pleural abnormalities. Fluid analysis and cytologic studies are informative, but thoracic ultrasonography, computed tomography, thoracotomy, or thoracoscopy with fine-needle aspiration or biopsy will often be necessary to obtain a definitive diagnosis. In addition to treating the underlying neoplasia, long-term and palliative management of neoplastic effusions can be achieved in some patients by surgically creating a drainage system, such as placement of vascular access ports with intrathoracic drains or thoracic omentalization.52, 53 In human medicine, chemical pleurodesis is often also performed palliatively.54 Intracavitary chemotherapy may also prove beneficial in some cases.",

Pulmonary edema and interstitial fibrosis may contribute to dyspnea.56 Decortication is the only successful therapy in humans and should be considered early for better outcome, while pulmonary changes are minimal.
