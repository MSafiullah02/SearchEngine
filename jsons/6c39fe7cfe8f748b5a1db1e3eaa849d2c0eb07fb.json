Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and avian influenza A (H5N1) pandemic occurred in 2003 and killed a large number of people and animals in many parts of the world.Matsui (2005) discussed the possible link between the origin of SARS pandemic in South East Asia and the living conditions of farmers (including the way to raise birds and pigs) in that region. It was suspected that viral transmission might have occurred among ducks/chickens, pigs, and humans by sharing ponds for domestic wastewater discharge, fish culture, and raising ducks. Provision of good human, pig, and chicken sanitation, such as wastewater treatment, was suggested for the successful control of these viral infections. The possibility of the transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) by the sewage system was also investigated(Wang et al., 2005). In Beijing, China, SARS-CoV ribonucleic acid was detected in the sewage from two hospitals receiving SARS patients by semi-nested real-time polymerase chain reaction and sequencing of genes.Although no live SARS-CoV was detected, they suggested that closer attention should be paid to the treatment of stools of patients and the sewage of hospitals to control SARS transmission.Hepatitis Viruses. In the Zenica-Doboj Canton, Bosnia and Herzegovina, 1106 hepatitis A virus infections were reported during 2000 (Uzunovic-Kamberovic et al., 2005). Poor sewage sanitation systems in rural households that deteriorated the water supplies were implicated as a promoter of the outbreak. Bofill-Mas et al. (2005) suggested that the prevalence of pathogenic viruses, such as hepatitis E virus and human polyomaviruses, in the environment represented significant health risks even in highly industrialized countries. The biosolids generated in wastewater treatment plants were considered a major source of viral contamination in the environment. Human Noroviruses. Norovirus infections are the most frequent causes of non-bacterial gastroenteritis, which lead to high virus loads in sewage. A number of norovirus variants were detected in 49 out of 53 sewage samples collected in the Netherlands in 2000 and 2001 with average concentrations of approximately 10 5 per detectable unit (pdu) per liter (van den Berg et al., 2005). Of these, two strains were prevalent among populations in Europe during the same period. Wastewater treatment achieved 2.0 to 2.7 log 10 unit of virus removal, resulting in 10 2 to 10 3 norovirus pdu/L in treated wastewater that possibly polluted drinking water, shellfish culture and recreational water. Ueki et al. (2005) demonstrated a potential geographical association of noroviruses between human and cultivated oysters via water environment in Miyagi prefecture, Japan. Treated wastewater (89% of the samples were positive for norovirus gene) was considered as one of the major sources of norovirus pollution. Gelting et al. (2005) demonstrated the importance of an environmental health assessment as a component of infectious disease outbreak investigation using an incidence of waterborne norovirus outbreak in Sheridan County, Wyoming in 2001 as an example. A systems-based environmental health assessment revealed that an on-site wastewater disposal system, which was not well suited to local soil and geologic conditions, in the recreational area of the Sheridan County was overloaded by increased use and contaminated drinking water wells that received no treatment or disinfection. The environmental health assessment can be useful to develop prevention strategies for avoiding reoccurrences of similar incidents.",

Hormones (especially 17\u03b1-ethynylestradiol) and nonlyphenol ethoxylates from a wastewater treatment plant were considered primarily responsible for those effects.Klein et al. (2005) also demonstrated elevated vitellogenin levels in breams sampled at near to or downstream of sewage plants' discharges in Southwestern Germany, although the linkage between the bioaccumulation and the effects of alkylphenols (such as 4-nonylphenol) and their ethoxylates Water Environment Research, Volume 78, Number 10-Copyright \u00a9 2006 Water Environment Federation 2090 in the sewage plant discharge could not be established. McMaster et al. (2005) reported that some responses of altered reproductive function in resident fish populations were observed downstream of a municipal wastewater treatment plant discharge as well as in the proximity of a pulp and paper mill in the Northern River Basins, Alberta, Canada. The uptake and effects of 4-nonlyphenol in the insectivorous tree swallow (Tachycineta bicolor) in wastewater lagoons in Vancouver, Canada (Dods et al., 2005), where elevated levels of 4-nonlyphenol were found in lagoon sediment and insects (82 to 383 \u00b5g/g dry weight and 156 to 310 ng/g wet weight, respectively). The clutch size and fledging success were significantly lower (p < 0.05 and < 0.001, respectively) in 2000, while the mean mass of nestling livers was significantly higher (p < 0.001) in tree swallows in the study site as compared with the reference site. They suggested the use of tree swallow as a possible indicator species for exposure of 4-nonylphenol at wastewater treatment plants. Vine et al. (2005) investigated the possible endocrine disruption in a top predator fish, pike (Esox lucius), by a wastewater treatment plant effluent in the United Kingdom. They hypothesized that this top predator fish might have been affected by lipophilic EDCs through predator-prey relationship; however, no evidence of severe disruption, measured by yeast-based estrogen assay of bile and histological analysis of gonads, was found in the sampled fish from 16 sampling sites.Weak biological effects were detected in wild carp (Cyprinus carpio) from three rivers in Spain, which were related to the exposure to estrogenic compounds (hormones, bisphenol A, and octylphenols) derived from sewage treatment plants(Carballo et al., 2005). Only in 18% of fish from one of the rivers (Guadarrama river) there were elevated levels of plasma vitellogenin, while neither abnormal gonadosomic index nor oocytes in the testis were found in any of the male fish examined.Genotoxins (Mutagens). Genotoxic pollutants are introduced into the aquatic environment by wastewaters coming from different sources. Jolibois and Guerbet (2005) investigated the removal of genotoxicity at two wastewater treatment plants that consisted of pre-treatment, primary treatment by settling, and secondary (activated sludge) treatment in the Rouen, France. Genotoxins were detected in almost all influents (24 samples) with the Ames fluctuation test on Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98, 100, 102 with or without metabolic activation, while all of the tested effluents were non-genotoxic, indicating effective removal of toxins during the wastewater treatment processes.",

No wild virus has been detected since 1961, which is consistent with the absence of paralytic poliomyelitis in this country. The vaccine-derived polio virus (VDPV) represents a major challenge to the eradication of polio as VDPV may acquire the virulence and transmission characteristics of wild poliovirus(\u010cern\u00e1kov\u00e1 et al., 2005). In 2003, type 2 polioviruses (later found to be VDPV) were detected in three samples taken from wastewater treatment facilities in the Slovak Republic, while no case of polio has occurred there since 1961. The use of oral polio vaccine is considered to be responsible for the circulation of VDPV in the environment.El Jadida, Morocco. The incidence of ascariasis was significantly higher (p < 0.001) in the group of children living near an area of wastewater effluent (18.1%) than in the control group (1%). They also noted that boys, particularly those aged 7 to 10, were the most vulnerable to contracting ascariasis.

Avery et al. (2005) demonstrated the persistence of highly virulent E. coli O157:H7 in raw and treated sewage sludge, as well as other organic wastes from slaughterhouses, creameries, and farms (bovine slurry). Although the number of E. coli O157:H7 gradually declined during the storage at 10 \u00b0C, it was still viable in 77% of the wastes tested after 2 months. Thus, long-term storage of sewage sludge cannot be expected to completely eliminate this pathogenic strain of E. coli. leachate of a municipal sewage sludge that contains toxic metals and organic chemicals can contaminate surface water and groundwater and lead to serious health hazards. Tewari et al. (2005) investigated the sub-acute genotoxic effects of municipal sludge leachate in mice. A dose-dependent inhibition of mitotic index and induction of chromatid/chromosome fragments and breaks were observed among other genotoxic effects in the male mice that were orally given leacheate (0.1 to 0.4 mL/mouse/day) for 15 days.",
