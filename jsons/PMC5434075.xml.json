An important research method is epidemiology, with mathematical modelling as an analytical approach [1,2]. Mathematical modelling is an effective tool in understanding the spread of infectious diseases: it provides the best way of translating our knowledge about the status of disease transmission at the level of contacts between individuals to a description of its spread within the community [3\u20136].",

            "text": "However, most traditional models for describing disease propagation suppose that a population is uniformly mixing, and they overlook partnerships of contacts, so these models fail to describe epidemic propagation in large-scale social contact networks with distinct heterogeneity. For most diseases, epidemic spreading through physical interactions on contact networks can be used as the as practical grounds on which to model infectious disease dynamics [7\u20139]. The transmission of diseases on networks is based on the major connections between people who have a link with each other, that is to say, when considering the spread of an epidemic, it is the contact structure or the links between individuals that determine the progress of the disease within the population. Thus, the key idea is that one should consider the population of dyads, rather than just individuals [10]. Considering the \u2018partnerships\u2019 in contact on a network, pair approximation (PA) is a suitable method to depict it. Although the technique is not precise, it does capture some features of the spread. It takes into account pairs of connected individuals instead of just single individuals [11\u201313]. Research on pair-wise epidemic models in networks has received much attention since Matsuda applied PA to the research of population systems [14\u201319]. Many works have contributed to moment closure and PA, and these methods produce viable approximations to dynamics but are generally high dimensional and computationally intensive [20\u201325]. Volz and Miller solved this problem successively by applying the probability-generating function (PGF) to closure equations for a susceptible\u2013infectious\u2013recovered (SIR) model [26\u201330]. House and Keeling carried out further research into a new PGF moment-closure-based SIR model on heterogeneous clustered networks of heterogeneous links according to the Eames and Keeling model [25] and the Volz model [26,27], and then performed some numerical tests of the clustered PGF model, in contrast to simulation and other ordinary differential equation (ODE) approaches [31].",

            "text": "An important issue of interest in epidemiological research is the behaviour of competing pathogens. In many circumstances, a variety of strains with different infections, toxins and mobilities can exist together and compete for the same susceptible population. On the one hand, different strains can lead to different infectious states, and a conversion between different states may occur. On the other hand, one pathogen sometimes generates many strains with different spreading features. Competitive multi-virus propagation shows very rich behaviour, beyond that of single-virus propagation, hence a detailed investigation of multi-virus epidemic dynamics is required [32\u201335]. In fact, this occurs not only in the process of epidemic spreading; information transmission also shows competition with other information in the same population [36,37]. In [33], competing strains in heterogeneous networks were studied, and the existence of an epidemic threshold in the presence of other strains in the susceptible\u2013infected\u2013susceptible (SIS) model was confirmed by using the heterogeneous mean-field approach. In [38], the Miller\u2013Volz model [28\u201330] was used to study two competing products within the same market. Their model shows that, if the two products have the same word-of-mouth marketing rate on the network, then the ratio of their market shares is exactly the same as the ratio of their advertisement rates. In these competitive spreading models, two or more viruses are exclusive: a node cannot be infected by two viruses simultaneously, that is to say, if a node (individual) is infected by one virus, it cannot be infected by the other one. This type of model has implications for many applications, such as product adoption (e.g. Apple versus Android smart phones), virus antidote propagation, opposing opinions about a subject, where people are for, against, or neutral, and so on [39]. But these methods cannot take the clustering coefficient into account, which is an important characteristic of network structure and has a significant impact on epidemic spreading [34,35,40\u201342].",

In \u00a73, we continue our discussion on the deterministic model described by House & Keeling [31], out of many different types of PAs, and propose our competing SIAR model, where I and A represent two competing viruses. At the same time, we derive the conditions for the local stability of this system. In \u00a74, some numerical simulations are performed to complement the previous theoretical study. Numerical results show that some conditions in [33] are insufficient and that the clustering coefficient also affects the final state of infection.",

Then [SI]/Y \u22481 when N is large enough in the initial spreading. For system (2.3), we have\nIt is clear that the change rate also depends on the value of [II]/Y . It is of order 1, even when the density of infectious individuals is small [43]. So, by a similar method, we get dCII[I]/N/dt.Then, if we denote CSI=x, [II]/Y =y, g\u2032\u2032(1)/g\u2032(1)=\u03be, we have\n2.6Now we discuss the existence and uniqueness of the positive solution of system (2.6).Obviously, the positive equilibrium (x*,y*) of system (2.6) satisfies the following equations:\nWe get that, if \u03b3\u22122\u03b2\u03a6\u03be>(2\u03b2\u03d5\u03be\u2212\u03b2(\u03be2\u22121))/(\u03be\u22121), it can ensure that 0<x*,y*<1. Then, we consider G={(x,y) | 0<x,y<1}. Therefore, system (2.6) has the unique positive solution (x*,y*). Now it is necessary to prove the global stability of (x*,y*). We calculate the Jacobian matrix in the positive equilibrium (x*,y*) of (2.6),\nunder the conditions of \u03b3\u22122\u03b2\u03a6\u03be>(2\u03b2\u03be\u2212\u03b2(\u03be2\u22121))/(\u03be\u22121). We denote a11=\u03b2\u03be\u2212\u03b2\u22122\u03b2nx*\u2212\u03b2\u03be\u03d5y*, a12=\u2212\u03b2\u03a6\u03bex*, a21=0, a22=2\u03b2\u03a6\u03be\u2212\u03b3\u2212\u03b2\u2212\u03b2\u03be.Clearly,\nIn that way, all real parts of the eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix are negative. Hence, the positive equilibrium (x*,y*) is locally asymptotically stable. Similarly, we find that (0,y*) is unstable.Now we further discuss the global stability of the positive equilibrium (x*,y*). For system (2.6), in G, we denote P(x,y)=\u03b2\u03bex\u2212\u03b2x\u2212\u03b2nx2\u2212\u03b2\u03be\u03a6xy, Q(x,y)=2\u03b2\u03a6\u03bey+2\u03b2\u2212\u03b3y\u2212\u03b2y\u2212\u03b2\u03bey. Let B(x,y)=1, then D=\u2202(BP)/\u2202x+\u2202(BQ)/\u2202y=(\u22122\u03b2nx\u2212\u03b2\u03bey\u22122\u03b2+2\u03b2\u03a6\u03be\u2212\u03b3), so the condition \u03b3\u22122\u03b2\u03a6\u03be\u2265\u22122\u03b2 should be ensured for the sake of the fixed sign of D, and, also, it is not identically equal to zero in any subregion. Therefore, based on the \u2018Bendixson\u2013Dulac criteria\u2019 [47,48], when \u03b3\u22122\u03b2\u03a6\u03be\u2265\u22122\u03b2 and \u03b3\u22122\u03b2\u03a6\u03be>((2\u03b2\u03be\u2212\u03b2(\u03be2\u22121))/(\u03be\u22121)), system (2.6) does not have limit cycles in G. So, the positive equilibrium point is globally stable. So, we obtain R0=\u03b2nx*/\u03b3. \u25aa",
