Tarantism, the dancing mania of peasant women (animal-like squealing, obscene shouting, laughing, or weeping) during the fifteenth to seventeenth century, St. John\u2019s or St. Vitus\u2019 dances in Northern Europe, the hysterical fits of women due to smells from hemp steeped in water (Ramazzini 1713) , industrial outbreak among workers in a cotton mill in the eighteenth century England ( Gentleman\u2019s Magazine 1787), are historically recorded events. Many other early psychogenic illnesses reported from schools, hospitals, prisons, and in warfare, exemplify the results of various reasons, like prominent social concerns and exposure to physical, biological, or chemical agents (Bartholomew and Wessely 2002; Sirois 2013) .",

These symptoms may appear among occupants in office buildings, schools, public buildings, hospitals, and recreational facilities.

These are designed to be airtight on energy-saving consideration\u2014windows remain sealed, deprived of natural ventilation and daylighting, and HVAC system re-circulates the air in the building, with the minimal replacement of fresh air. Concerns about human health due to deteriorating indoor environmental quality are steadily increasing with a public outcry among the building occupants and also challenging lawsuits to redress grievances. The term SBS has been in use for some time now and widely recognized, in spite of suggestions for alternative names, such as problem buildings, building-related occupant complaint syndrome, abused building syndrome. Acknowledging that the incidences of SBS symptoms are straightforward, its characterization and linkages to an indoor exposure require more in-depth analysis. An impediment towards this effort is to make the primary distinction as to whether the problem is chemical, biological, physical, or psychogenic. The questions to examine are the mechanism how workplace or environmental processes trigger physical health symptoms, and whether some individuals are more prone to illnesses. Further, it calls for a review on the kind of critical work settings that precipitate illness conditions, and how the work or environmental aspects influence building occupant\u2019s psychophysiological threshold, making oneself hypersensitive even to mild irritants. Priority is placed on exploring organizational interventions to restrict the spread of the syndrome and efficiently manage causes of building-related illnesses.",

The interactions of a multitude of factors, such as the site, climate, building system, construction materials, building dampness, contaminant sources, activities of occupants, affect the quality of indoor air. Typically, maintaining allowable IAQ in office buildings depends on effective ventilation systems in operation. Ineffective or inadequate ventilation systems result in inefficient removal of pollutants from indoor air and display signs of SBS among the occupants.",

Apparent relationships exist between the external stimuli, kinds of human responses and about the type of building environment. Therefore, the discomfort and symptoms of occupants in the building require acknowledging that an exposure scenario exists, and the discomfort and disease have a strong association with psychologic or physiological components. A structured questionnaire (Table 3.1) may be used to ascertain the SBS of the respondents in an office building. The office workers who had at least one symptom of SBS and onset of two or more symptoms at least twice weekly, overnight resolution of symptoms after leaving the workstation or building, and the absence of known medical causes, may be defined as having SBS (Ooi et al. 1998). The prevalence of symptoms among building occupants is linked to personal exposure to the indoor environment. The symptoms may vary during the day, in the course of changes in the concentrations of indoor pollutants. Further, the prevalence of syndrome might differ with the specificity of criteria for the definitive diagnosis of a case. Accordingly, there may be a shift in the frequency distribution of affected workers when the requirements were changed to one symptom, instead of two or more symptoms (Ooi et al. 1998).\n",

The technical factors associated with the increased prevalence of SBS are the building factors, such as the age of the building, indoor dampness, presence of some photocopiers and humidifiers in the building (Sundell 1996) . Zweers et al. (1992) examined 7043 occupants (65% female) in 61 office buildings in the Netherlands and noted that occurrence of SBS symptoms was related to air conditioning and humidification in buildings. Females had more prevalence of SBS (e.g., skin/eye/nasal symptoms) and complaints of indoor climate, such as temperature, air quality, lighting, and noise. Carrying out of study on 4943 office workers (53% female) in Sweden, Stenberg and Wall (1995) observed a higher prevalence of SBS among females (OR = 3.4) than males.",

Undoubtedly, the physical and psychological disposition, on the one hand, and work- and job-related factors, on the other hand, are risk factors on the perception of the indoor environment and the pathogenesis of complaints. With a sample size of 368 office workers (~77% females) from 6 office buildings in the USA, Reynolds et al. (2001) observed that the psychosocial factors were positively correlated with the incidences of SBS in females. However, the environmental factors were correlated with symptoms in males. By examining 877 occupants (50% female) in 12 office buildings in Quebec, Canada, Donnini et al. (1997) observed no significant differences in thermal neutrality between males (23.5 \u00b0C) and females (23.8 \u00b0C). Females expressed significantly higher thermal dissatisfaction (63% female vs. 37% male). Nakano et al. (2002) examined 406 Japanese office workers (37% females) and noted a significant difference in thermal neutrality, i.e., females (25.1 \u00b0C) and males (22.9 \u00b0C), while females reported a higher frequency of SBS symptoms, as compared to the male group. In a study on 935 office occupants (48% female), in 22 office buildings in Australia, Cena and de Dear (1999) noted the votes of thermal unacceptability, and females complained of significantly higher thermal dissatisfaction than those of males. Choi et al. (2010) had a similar observation by studying 402 office workers (~53% females) from 20 office buildings in the USA. Runeson et al. (2003) investigated the prevalence and change of SBS symptoms in buildings with suspected indoor air problems about Antonovsky\u2019s sense of coherence (SOC), a psychological measure of life attitude. The study was conducted on a cohort of 194 workers from 19 Swedish buildings with indoor environmental problems between 1988 and 1998. Information on 16 SBS symptoms was gathered, as well as the SOC measure was administered in a postal follow-up. After adjusting for age, gender, history of atopy, and ETS, Runeson et al. (2003) noted that SBS was more common in women, younger ones, and those with a history of atopy. A low SOC was related to a higher prevalence of ocular, nasal, and throat symptoms, tiredness, and headache. Also, subjects with a low SOC developed more symptoms during the follow-up period.",

The onset of CFS has been related to a variety of psychological, environmental, and behavioral factors (Pizzigallo et al. 1999), and exposure to pesticides, organophosphates, solvents, and other chemicals (Bell et al. 1998). In tropical areas, many CFS-like cases follow an episode of gastroenteritis due to food toxins from ciguatoxic fish (Pearn 1995) . Ciguatera consists of a food-chain disease that starts with a reef-dwelling dinoflagellate, Gambierdiscus toxicus (Gillespie et al. 1986), which is heat-stable. Individuals can be poisoned from eating fresh or frozen fish, or fish products. Symptomatology of some outbreaks of SBS resembles CFS, associating with building characteristics, such as old buildings, inadequate ventilation, non-functioning windows, and inefficient HVAC system (Chester and Levine 1997) . Thousands of Gulf War veterans, even 5 years after the Operation Desert Storm in 1991, remained ill with vague symptoms that resemble CFS. These veterans were exposed to an array of hazards, such as extremes of climate, dust, and smoke from oil well fires, petroleum fuels and products, depleted uranium (used in artillery shells), chemical warfare agents, pesticides, infectious diseases, and pervasive psychological and physical stress. The veterans were administered with pyridostigmine bromide (as pre-treatment for potential poison gas exposure), anthrax and botulinum toxoid vaccines (Landrigan 1997). Haley et al. (1997) identified six different syndromes among the war veterans, namely:Syndrome 1 (impaired cognition)\u2014reported by veterans wearing flea collars during the war than those who never wore them;Syndrome 2 (confusion-ataxia)\u2014reported by veterans involved in chemical exposure (e.g., pyridostigmine bromide);Syndrome 3 (arthro-myo-neuropathy)\u2014exposure to insecticides containing 75% DEET (N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide);Syndrome 4 (phobia-apraxia);Syndrome 5 (fever-adenopathy); andSyndrome 6 (weakness-incontinence).\n",

Findings from more mechanically ventilated and air-conditioned buildings indicated a significant association between an increase in CO2 and SBS symptoms, and total symptom scores.

For new or renovated buildings, VOCs are primarily emitted from building products. Secondary emissions of VOCs result from ageing of building products, by chemical decomposition (e.g., moisture build-up or inadequate maintenance) or physical damage due to heat and UV light (Wolkoff 1999) . Furniture coatings release nearly 150 VOCs (aliphatic and aromatic aldehydes, aromatic hydrocarbons, ketones, esters, and glycols) (Salthammer 1997) . Office equipment and supplies, such as laser printing toners, emit VOCs, ozone, formaldehyde, resin, and other particles. Use of perfumes indoors may release VOCs. Indoor fungi are also a source for the production of VOCs. Many VOCs are known toxic compound, with potential for carcinogenicity, mutagenicity, or teratogenicity. Documented evidence strongly affirms that occurrence of SBS follows predictable dose\u2013response relationships with increasing concentrations of mixtures of VOCs. The VOCs, such as O-xylene, styrene, d-limonene and other terpene compounds may readily react with ozone and NOx entrained from outdoors and produce highly reactive compounds, including aldehydes and ultrafine particles, leading to sensory irritant symptoms (Sarwar et al. 2002; Sundell 2004) . These effects have been observed in case of carpet emissions, latex paint off-gassing, and other office pollutants.",

In California Healthy Buildings Study, Brinke et al. (1998) adopted an approach in developing VOC metrics and identified relationships between SBS symptoms and clusters of VOCs by its possible emission sources. The principal component analysis (PCA) allowed to cluster VOCs into a reduced set of principal component (PC) vectors and further estimated the association between SBS symptoms and the VOC exposure metrics, using logistic regression analysis. A similar approach was taken by Apte and Daisey (1999) in exploring the causal associations between SBS and environmental stressors, using a subset of data from 28 office buildings of the US EPA BASE study. Four source-based PC vectors were derived that identify sources as photocopiers, automotive emissions, ETS, and latex paints. Regression analyses indicated significant associations between mucous membrane-related symptoms and the photocopier vector, after adjustment for age, gender, smoking status, the presence of carpeting, and thermal exposure. Sore throat symptoms were associated with the paint vector. Analysis of dataset of all 100 BASE buildings revealed 36 VOCs, formaldehyde and acetaldehyde corresponded to 41 buildings, whereas 19 VOCs were available in all buildings. The PCA yielded ten PCs identified as the VOC sources (Apte and Erdmann 2003). Seven components referred to as furniture coatings (PC1), paint (PC2), construction materials (PC3), printing materials and processes (PC4), carpet and undercarpet (PC5), parking garage (PC6), and cleaning products (PC7) met the criterion of having eigenvectors \u22651.0.",

Little is known about the likely oxidative stress that can attribute to the occurrence of SBS due to exposure risks of air pollutants or other factors of the environment. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are components found in many of the air pollutants and can cause oxidative damage to lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids. Urinary 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8- OHdG) is a known biological marker of oxidative stress on DNA. Accumulation of ETS, VOCs, formaldehyde in the building due to insufficient ventilation can result in the rise of urinary 8-OHdG levels among occupants (Calderon-Garciduenas et al. 1999). Lu et al. (2007) gathered data from self-reported questionnaires and analysis of on-site air pollutants and urinary 8-OHdG of 389 employees in 87 government offices of eight high-rise buildings in Taipei city. The urinary 8-OHdG was significantly associated with VOCs and CO2 levels in offices, and the 8-OHdG level were significantly higher among the employees with SBS symptoms than in those without such complaints. A positive dose\u2013response effect between 8-OHdG levels and the number of symptoms was suggestive that the urinary 8-OHdG as a viable non-invasive marker can be taken as a predictor for SBS.",

Findings indicated that both ETS exposure and overtime work contributed to the development of SBS.

The PCA analysis of the ergonomics checkpoints yielded five aspects of work, as organizational (PC1\u2015describing job design needs, workplace interventions, and constraints of VDT workstations), environmental (PC2\u2015covering illumination-, climate-, and noise-related hazards), mechanistic (PC3\u2015referring to job specialization, pace of work, information handling), perceptual and motor (PC4\u2015describing visual and auditory displays and controls), and motivational (PC5\u2015referring to personal job characteristics and core dimensions). The loading of the work stressors explained in PC1 to PC3 appeared autonomous, irrespective of the shift schedules at which the women were engaged. The operators in the rotating shift had higher sensitivity to the stressors related to PC4. The day workers responded greater to the stressors related to the core job dimensions that reflect growth needs (PC5). The sleep disturbance, flexibility to sleeping habits, and personality dimension (neuroticism) were negatively correlated with PC1. The digestive problems, social and domestic disruption, and languidity dimensions were positively correlated to PC4 and PC5. The operators in rotating shift had increased demand in the perceptual and motor, and the motivational aspects of work, and thus causing greater negative influence on physical health symptoms, and social and domestic disruption. The job design interventions tailoring to delay the morning shift and adjust the shift length based on the work and climatic load (that is, reduce work hours in the evening shift to avoid peak workload, and extend hours of day work during the hot summer months) might alleviate work stress and enhance health and well-being. Manifestations of work-related stress call for organizational analysis and job design interventions in structuring the workplace.",

By examining 104 employees from four geriatric hospital units in southern Sweden, Nordstrom et al. (1994) evaluated the effect of steam air humidification on SBS and perceived air quality during the heating season. Air humidification was raised to 40\u201345% RH in two units during a four-month period, whereas the other two units were maintained at 25\u201335% RH. After four months of air humidification during the heating season, 24% of the employees reported a weekly sensation of dryness in humidified units, compared with 73% in controls, indicating that air humidification during the heating season in colder climates can decrease symptoms of SBS and perception of dry air. In a tropical environment, RH remains at a much higher level even in an indoor office environment; therefore, incidences of SBS in such situations may be attributed to factors other than air dryness or humidification.",

The number of olfs is indicated on the initial perception of the odour, referring to discomfort from irritation and annoyance from odour, and overall acceptability. This method was deployed in a project assessing air quality in 20 offices/assembly halls in Copenhagen, and 54 external judges adjudged the air quality in unoccupied and occupied, and with or without ventilating systems in buildings. About 42% of the perceived defects in air quality was due to ventilation systems, 38% was due to combined occupant activities and occupants themselves, and 20% due to building materials. The stated method has limitations of efficacy since the raters assess the pollution level in a site within minutes of entering the site. The majority of the occupants may not be able to rate odours consistently, and also the odour annoyance is generally perceived most severe early on first exposure and recedes over time.",

            "text": "Cladosporium, Penicillium, and Aspergillus produce high numbers of small and light spores (<10 \u00b5m in size). Penicillium and Aspergillus can grow in substrates with water activity lower than 0.80. The smaller particles can penetrate into the alveolar region when inhaled, evade phagocytosis by macrophages, and transport through systemic circulation (Reponen et al. 2007; Seo et al. 2009) , whereas the larger spores and other fragments get deposited in the nasopharynx. Kildeso et al. (2003) studied the release of particles from indoor fungi growing in wetted wallpapered gypsum boards, for 46 weeks. When Penicillium chrysogenum were subjected to air currents, only spores were released from the colonies, but with Aspergillus versicolor, both spores, and fragments were released. With Trichoderma harzianum, particles released are\u2014groups of spores (5\u20136 \u00b5m), individual spores (2\u20133 \u00b5m) and fragments (0.7\u20131 \u00b5m). Seo et al. (2009) reported the release of fragments and spores from Aspergillus Versicolor and Stachybotrys chartarum growing on the surface of ceiling tiles, wallpapered gypsum board, and culture medium. The studies are suggestive that long-term mould damage in buildings may increase the contribution of fungal fragments to the overall mould exposure.",

In the impactor method, the airstream is passed through progressively narrower slits into a culture medium and microscopic glass slides covered with an adhesive substance or tape strip is used to collect the sample, and counted by optical microscopy (Zhen et al. 2009). Andersen six-stage impactor is used for collection of particles on culture medium. In Andersen sampler, in a Petri dish could grow 400 colonies. Fast-growing colonies may grow above the slow growing and hinder in counting colonies (Stetzenbach et al. 2004) . The dichloran-glycerol-18 agar (DG-18) culture medium with fungistatic properties prevents the growth of the fast-growing fungi (Horner et al. 2004). Liquid impingers collect the samples into the fluid, and the micro-organisms are retained in the liquid until they are cultivated, or evaluated by techniques like biochemical or immunoassays (Jo 2011). Shipe sampler, AGT\u201330 glass impinger, midget, multi-stage, and micro impingers are common impinger devices (Gralton et al. 2011). Air filtration is used to collect the samples of indoor air in volume. In this method after sampling, the filters are agitated or sonicated in a solution (Bazaka et al. 2011).",

Air sampling by impingement has some advantages over impaction on solid surfaces; for example, if the concentration of microbes in the atmosphere is too high, the liquid could be diluted before adding to the culture medium. Collection of the cells in a liquid avoids desiccation resulting from impaction on solid surfaces (Stetzenbach et al. 2004) . Impaction directly onto agar plates may maximize survival of culturable organisms. In addition to impaction and impingement, other methods like filtration by aspiration and sedimentation sampling have been used. In filtration, three types of filter media are used, such as porous fibrous filters with overlapping fibres, porous gel membrane filters, and capillary pore filters. Filter materials include glass fibre, mixed cellulose esters, polytetrafluoroethylene, polyvinyl chloride, gelatin, and polycarbonate (Martinez et al. 2004 ).\nMembrane filters can be placed directly on the surface of culture medium or washed with a liquid, and this added to culture medium. Specific filters (namely gelatin) are dissolvable in warm liquids, and the resulting suspension can be plated on agarized medium. That is, filtration devices are adaptable for air sampling of wall cavities or roof spaces to pinpoint foci of contamination.",

The effects of trichothecenes exposure in humans include internal burning, vomiting, and diarrhoea with blood, cutaneous necrosis, and internal haemorrhages. Evidence gathered that exposure to higher concentrations of Penicillium and Aspergillus in the indoor environment could induce health problems and SBS symptoms. Severe asthma and acute exacerbations of asthma have been associated with Alternaria sensitivity and increased airborne concentrations of Alternaria spores (Salo et al. 2005). Vance and Weissfeld (2007) warned that the presence of S. chartarum indoors is a concern since its growth requires water saturation of cellulose-based materials such as paper, cardboard, wood, and gypsum board (Menetrez and Foarde 2004; Gottschalk et al. 2006). It is likely that plumbing and roof leaks provide the needed moisture for the fungus to grow. The small size, ellipsoid shape Stachybotrys spores can reach the lower respiratory tract (Murtoniemi et al. 2003) . The causal relationship between S. chartarum and SBS has been debated, with the view that health effects may be due to the presence of other pollutants, like VOCs ( MVOCs), endotoxins, respirable dust, and other compounds in the indoor environment (Bloom et al. 2007). DON, a trichothecene mycotoxin mainly produced by Fusarium molds, like other mycotoxins, is an immunomodulator that can enhance or suppress the immune system depending upon the dose and duration of exposure (Lee et al. 1999; Zhou et al. 1999) . The T2-toxin, which is produced by species of Fusarium and diacetoxyscirpenol, has been shown to modulate apoptosis in human promyelocytic leukaemia cells (Yoshino et al. 1996; Yang et al. 2000).",

Trichothecene mycotoxins produced by Stachybotrys, satratoxin, and roridin have been identified in serum using an ELISA assay. Generally viewed that the mixture components, including fungi, bacteria, mycotoxins, endotoxins, and lipopolysaccharides, interact synergistically, through the feedback control of pro-inflammatory cytokine production and induce SBS (Huttunen et al. 2004). The onset of SBS is typically observed following chronic exposure in water-damaged buildings, extending for many months. Needless to mention that health risk assessment for SBS has many uncertainties, such as the extent of toxin accumulation in tissues, interspecies differences in susceptibility, and threshold shifts of the repair mechanisms during chronic exposure (Shoemaker and House 2005; Shoemaker et al. 2005). There is an evident need to make the focus on innovative and effective therapeutic interventions (e.g., Cholestyramine (CSM) therapy) to remove biotoxins from the body, caused by toxic mould exposure.",

For example, Penicillium, Aspergillus, and Stachybotrys are VOCs as well as mycotoxin producers (Matysik et al. 2008) . MVOCs are produced by the cells and released to the indoor environment, whereas mycotoxins are present inside the cells and fragments (Reponen et al. 2007) . In healthy individuals, the fungal spores and fragments are destroyed by cells of the immune system, but a small number of mycotoxins can still enter in the systemic circulation with possible chronic or sub-chronic toxic effects (Straus 2009) .",

Asthma can be adult onset or occupational in origin. From a clinical point of view, bronchial asthma is a well-known lung condition, defined as a chronic inflammatory disease, due to the contraction of the bronchial muscles, increased mucous production or decreased clearance, and muscle tightening, causing variable airflow obstruction (Fig. 3.1). Coughing, wheezing, chest tightness, shortness and shallow breathing, anxiety, and tachycardia are the common signs and symptoms of asthma. The inflammation causes airway hyper-responsiveness and is the reason for the appearance of variable and reversible airflow obstruction. Occupational asthma is caused by breathing substances present at workplaces, such as chemical fumes, gases or dust which are irritating or sensitizing. Exposure to these substances develops an immune response either to respiratory irritants (gas, fume, or vapour), usually of low molecular mass at high concentration, referred to as irritant-induced\noccupational asthma, or to sensitizing agents (e.g., high molecular mass\u2015glycoproteins of biological origin), referred to as sensitizer-induced occupational asthma. These exposures are characteristically associated with symptoms at work with relief on weekends and holidays. With early diagnosis and treatment, occupational asthma may be reversible. Table 3.5 includes the most common asthmagen agents.\n\n",

Respiratory symptoms (a cough, wheezing, chest tightness, and dyspnea) may persist for 3 months. Low-molecular mass agents probably become antigenic after conjugation with a body protein (e.g., serum albumin), and its response clinically manifest as direct epithelial cell injury. The procedure to diagnose RADS includes analysis of occupational history, inventory of exposures in the workplace, pulmonary function tests (PFT), serial peak expiratory flow measurement on work days and days off, histamine or methacholine challenge, and immunological tests, such as specific IgE and skin prick, epicutaneous tests (Fishwick et al. 2008; Tarlo et al. 2008) . The PFT may show evidence of airway obstruction (FEV1/FVC ratio less than 0.7), although the absence of airway obstruction does not exclude a diagnosis of the disease. For irritant-induced asthma due to indoor environmental exposures, specific bronchial challenges may not diagnose; also the peak expiratory flow (PEF) is not diagnostically specific. However, conventional approach of observing an elevated diurnal variation in PEF might suggest the presence of asthma. Bronchodilator response may be seen in individuals with acute irritant-induced asthma. A chest radiograph is usually normal, although it may show no specific signs associated with coexisting respiratory infection. A bronchial biopsy may indicate possible inflammation with lymphocytes and plasma cells, as a manifestation of epithelial cell injury.",

Once the subject is sensitized, asthma attacks are provoked even with exposure to a shallow concentration of the sensitizing agent. Diagnosis is typically achieved from the evidence of reversible variable airway limitations, along with asthmatic trends between periods of work and rest. PFT may become normal rapidly after the cessation of the exposure. A serial PEF (about four recordings a day) over three weeks has high specificity and sensitivity in making the diagnosis of occupational asthma. Serum-specific IgE may assist in making a diagnosis, due to its likely presence in persons exposed to allergens with high molecular weight and some chemical agents. Skin prick tests may also be positive for the workplace allergen. Increased bronchial reactivity to challenge with the agents, such as histamine, methacholine, is evidence of sensitizer-induced occupational asthma, and this may be carried out sequentially over time. Allergens that cause occupational asthma can also cause allergic rhinitis (nasal symptoms) that may precede the onset of occupational asthma symptoms or may commence at the same time as asthma symptoms.",

            "text": "The term Asthma-like (suspected asthma) is indicative that all asthma-like symptoms are not associated with asthma. These include chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic bronchitis, chronic cough, hyperventilation, mechanical obstruction of the airways, congestive heart failure, pulmonary embolism, gastro-oesophageal reflux, multiple chemical sensitivity/idiopathic environmental illness, SBS, Sjogren\u2019s syndrome, vocal cord dysfunction. The chronic obstructive\npulmonary disease is characterized by a slowly progressive reduction of pulmonary ventilation due to a combination of emphysema and bronchiolitis with obstruction of the small airways. ETS is a critical aetiological factor. Chronic cough has different aetiologies\u2014a cough at night or associated with physical exercise may be indications of asthma. The asthma tests such as reversibility to a bronchodilator and increased levels of exhaled nitric oxide should be positive (Chatkin et al. 1999). Hyperventilation syndrome is indicated by symptoms induced by physiologically inappropriate hyperventilation or voluntary hyperventilation. Shortness of breath, accelerated/deepened breathing, and feeling of inability to breathe deeply are asthma-like. Symptoms reproduced by a hyperventilation test and a slow recovery of CO2 in blood or expired air are the two criteria for establishing the diagnosis (Ringsberg and Akerlind 1999) . RADS is an illness with asthma-like symptoms that may occur as the direct consequence of excessive toxic inhalation exposure. The bronchial histological changes show an increase in inflammatory cells. However, eosinophils and mast cells do not dominate. Multiple\nchemical sensitivity (also named as idiopathic environmental intolerance) is a disease caused due to some low dose of exposure to chemical toxicants, manifesting diverse symptoms (e. g., headache, weakness, memory problems, inability to concentrate, throat soreness, abdominal pain, and discomfort). One may suffer from nasal congestion and asthma-like symptoms such as cough and chest tightness. As elaborated earlier, SBS is a complex disease caused primarily due to building characteristics of the indoor environment, including inadequacies in air-handling systems. Sjogren\u2019s syndrome is a systemic rheumatic disease. Vocal cord dysfunction is characterized by episodic or acute attacks of breathing troubles similar to attacks of asthma. In asthma-like disorder, treatment compliance with conventional therapy is low (Schmier and Leidy 1998; Chan et al. 1998) . Medication with steroids are the most potent drugs in the treatment of asthma.",

Symptoms, such as difficulty in breathing and breathlessness, which indicate asthma, may also be indicators of sensory hyper-reactivity. The diagnosis of sensory hyper-reactivity is a clinical challenge; PFT is sometimes difficult to obtain due to inability to perform an adequate forced expiration, giving a false indication of bronchoconstriction (Ringsberg et al. 1997).

In physical examination, crackles in the lower fields of the lungs may be noticed. A chest X-ray may show fine interstitial infiltrates in acute and sub-acute forms of the disease, whereas in the chronic form, irregular scarring may indicate diffuse pulmonary fibrosis. In PFT, typically patients may show restrictive impairment, i.e., the FEV1/FVC ratio reduced in comparison with its normal range. The EAA is a diffuse parenchymal disease, and thus, the diffusion capacity of the lungs is affected (both DLco and Kco). Bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and transbronchial biopsy may be carried out when investigating a patient with suspected EAA. BAL typically shows increased total cell count, with an increased proportion of lymphocytes (>40%). T-helper to T-suppressor ratio is usually reduced to less than 1. After acute exposure, neutrophils are transiently increased. The histopathologic findings include diffuse interstitial infiltrate, scattered non-caseating granulomas, and cellular inflammation of the bronchioles. An inhalation provocation test with the specific antigen can be performed to confirm the diagnosis; a worksite challenge test is a conventional approach, with PFT before and after workplace exposure. Management of EAA primarily demands to remove the affected persons from the source of exposure. Drug intervention with corticosteroids is given at the acute episodes. Any dampness or mould problems in buildings should be repaired promptly.",

The transmission depends upon the number and size of particles produced, the velocity at which they are produced, micro-organisms contained within the droplets, and proximity of a susceptible target (Gralton et al. 2011). The longevity of the pathogens depends on temperature and humidity, ultraviolet (UV) radiation, and atmospheric pollutants (Tang 2009) . Depending on the size and density, residues of suspended droplet nuclei can remain suspended and penetrate deep into the lung tissues. Droplet nuclei that are exhaled during normal breathing are only a small fraction than those aerosols produced when coughing or sneezing (Gralton et al. 2011). Factors, such as local ventilation, the activity of occupants indoors, and thermal gradients produced due to office equipment influence the movement of the suspended droplets (Nielsen 2009; Eames et al. 2009; Clark and de Calcina-Goff 2009) .

Due to the random character of natural ventilation during different seasons of the year, emphasis among the building designers goes in installing mechanical ventilation and HVAC systems. The natural ventilation no longer provides optimal distribution of fresh air in the buildings. However, several views have been put forward with regard to mechanical ventilation systems and acute health symptoms (SBS/BR), asthma and allergy symptoms among occupants in buildings. Mendel et al. (2003, 2006), examining US NIOSH data of 80 office building, emphasized that improperly maintained ventilation systems increase the adverse health effects among the occupants, particularly the asthmatics, due to exposure to accumulated pollutants and microbiological growth. Comparing with naturally ventilated systems, the presence of air-conditioning increased respiratory symptoms in office buildings located in a hot and humid climate (Graudenz et al. 2005). Takahashi et al. (2008) reported that the presence of a ventilation system was associated with increased allergic symptoms, probably due to the entry of large quantities of pollen into the dwellings through the air ducts and other factors, not directly related to the ventilation system. Dwellings installed with air conditioners, and those had poor maintenance of ventilation systems, resulted in increased prevalence of SBS (Wong et al. 2004; Coelho et al. 2005), as compared to those in naturally ventilated dwellings. Some multidisciplinary reviews on relationships between ventilation rate and health outcomes are summarized in Table 3.7.\n",

The assertion from the BASE study of the association of SBS with the increasing difference in concentration of CO2 between indoor and outdoor brings forward the suggestion that a relative increase in the ventilation rates per person in an office building may reduce the prevalence of SBS symptoms. A concentration of CO2 (800 ppm) has been suggested as a control limit value. Erdmann and Apte (2004) observed a remarkable reduction in mucosal symptoms ranging from 65 to 85% when CO2 levels in offices dropped in the range from 610 to 40 ppm above outdoor levels.",

As elaborated earlier, asthma symptoms can be evoked by irritating chemicals or sensitizing agents.

For new buildings, the prevention measures in reducing mould contamination include, for example, (a) minimizing moisture accumulation in construction materials, (b) maintaining the integrity of building impermeable envelope, and (c) ensuring the effectiveness of HVAC system to control thermal comfort and relative humidity. In the existing buildings, corrective measures include (a) repair and maintenance of water leakage in ceilings, walls, and draining systems, (b) deep cleaning of building interiors and HVAC systems, (c) control of the reservoirs of visible mould in ceiling and carpets, and (d) periodic assessment of IAQ. Once a mould problem is established, a well-documented action plan may be followed to notify people for (a) rectifying the underlying moisture problem, (b) minimizing spread of contamination, by cleaning of ventilation pathways and enhancing ventilation to exhaust the relevant pollutants from indoors, and (c) removing mouldy materials. It is important to consider that fungal spores are continually entering into the indoor environment and a remedial measure to fungal contamination is the maintenance of dry conditions in a building. As part of remediation, an entire or part of a building may be heated to a temperature that should kill most of the fungal spores. Caution is needed that heat may not damage specific equipment and plastic materials.",

Infection of rhinoviruses causes adults to suffer the frequent common cold. Myatt et al. (2004) provided evidence of aerosol transmission of rhinovirus in mechanically ventilated office buildings that resulted in an increased risk of inhaling infectious droplets. In student rooms having a ventilation rate of about 1 l/s per person, the frequency of common colds was six times more among 35% of the students. The number of common colds was higher in winter. Reported common colds were higher when some students shared a room. By increasing the ventilation rate to 5 l/s per person, the self-reported common colds dropped to a mere 5% (Sun et al. 2011b) , suggesting that ventilation from outdoor-to-indoor bears greater significance in diluting and dispersing virus-laden droplets (Mendell et al. 2002). Milton et al. (2000) observed a reduction in short-term sick leave among office workers when the outdoor air supply rates increased from 12 to 24 l/s per person in an office building. Mendell et al. (2013) reported the relative decrease of illness absence of about 1.6% for each additional ventilation rate of 1 l/s per person.",

High discharge velocity air curtains provide a strong momentum to redirect coughing and sneezing jets and minimize cross infection (Aubert and Solliec 2011; Nino et al. 2011) , and also influence heat gain/loss in a facility (Foster et al. 2006). With a protected occupied zone ventilation, POV system, the intake fraction of coughed particles in the breathing zone of the receiver occupant decreased to a significant extent, as compared to an MV system (Liu et al. 2014) .

Direct sunlight passing through an ordinary window can kill M. tuberculosis and Meningococci within a few hours. Streptococcus pyogenes cannot survive more than 5 min under sunlight, compared with more than an hour in diffuse daylight. Lethality of sunlight against staphylococci is due to radiation at 300\u2013380 nm; in addition to bactericidal effect, solar radiation is mutagenic. Ordinary window glass absorbs solar radiation at <300 nm, which permits entry of solar UV-A and small amounts of UV-B. Research indicates that UV wavelengths inactivate microbes by causing cross-links between constituent nucleic acids; the formation of intra-strand cyclobutyl-pyrimidine dimers within DNA leads to mutations and cell death (Maclean et al. 2010). Exposure to high-intensity visible violet light at 405 nm is likely to be associated with photoexcitation of porphyrin molecules, resulting in the production of reactive oxidative species that are strongly bactericidal (Hamblin et al. 2005).",
