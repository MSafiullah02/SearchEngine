They contain the largest positive-sense single-stranded RNA genome of all known RNA viruses. Once cell entry is achieved, the virion sheds its envelope to begin replication in the cytoplasm of the host cell. After binding to cellular ribosomes the released viral polymerase begins the RNA replication cycle. The newly formed nucleocapsids continue to acquire new envelopes by budding through the membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum of the cell. The virions are then released into the general blood and lymph circulation, ready to infect new cells, other organs, and new hosts. In more than a third of patients, the syndrome progresses to severe disease with respiratory distress and oxygen desaturation that requires ventilatory support approximately 8 days after onset of symptoms. Mortality has been found to vary by transmission group, ranging from 3% to 20%. This suggests that the aetiology of SARS depends on a heterogeneous population of viral quasispecies with varying degrees of virulence.",

Sodium-dependent vitamin C transporters (SVCT) are mainly responsible for the absorption, distribution and retention of vitamin C. Because of the diverse expression and concentration dependency of these transporters, the pharmacokinetics of vitamin C at the physiological level is highly complex, compartmental, and non-linear, but appears to change from zero to first order, showing a constant and dose-independent half-life when administered as an intravenous infusion. After one dose, vitamin C circulates in plasma, is freely filtered by the renal glomerulus, and is reabsorbed at the proximal tubule by the first SVCT (SVCT1). Although SVCT1 regulates vitamin C homeostasis throughout the body, a high affinity, low capacity SVCT (SVCT2) protects metabolically-active cells against oxidative stress, which facilitates vitamin C accumulation where it is needed 2 . Dehydroascorbic acid (the oxidized form of vitamin C) is transported by glucose transporters (GLUT), where it is reduced to avoid irreversible decomposition. In situations such as sepsis, vitamin C absorption in cells is reduced due to increased cytokine secretion.",

All known physiological and biochemical actions of vitamin C are due to this characteristic. Vitamin C has immunostimulatory effects, antioxidant, antiinflammatory and antiviral properties, and could also have an antimutagenic effect 3,4 . Studies have shown that vitamin C improves neutrophil chemotaxis, phagocytosis, and therefore microbial clearance 5,6 . It also promotes T cell and natural killer cell proliferation and modulates their functions 7 . Vitamin C is also needed for catecholamine synthesis (formation of adrenaline from dopamine by dopamine betahydroxylase) 8,9 and adrenal steroidogenesis 10 . By recycling tetrahydrobiopterin, a critical cofactor in catecholamine synthesis, vitamin C improve noradrenaline synthesis by increasing expression of tyrosine hydroxylase 11 . It is also a cofactor for peptidylglycine alpha-amidating monooxygenase, an enzyme that is required for the endogenous synthesis of vasopressin 12 . A study in cardiac surgery patients has suggested that preoperative administration of vitamin C mitigates etomidate-induced adrenal suppression 13 . All this has recently sparked considerable interest in the use of vitamin C in the treatment of haemodynamically unstable patients, because the vitamin Cdependent synthesis of the vasopressors norepinephrine and vasopressin may play an important role in supporting cardiovascular function during severe infections and septic shock 14 .

In another study in patients with severe pneumonia, significantly lower in-hospital mortality was observed in the group treated with vitamin C 31 . Clinical trials carried out at the Virginia Commonwealth University have showed that high plasma levels of vitamin C act \"pleiotropically\" to attenuate systemic inflammation and correct sepsis-induced coagulation abnormalities while attenuating vascular injury (CITRIS-ALI clinical trial; identifier NCT02106975).

Unlike oxygen, ozone reacts as soon as it dissolves in any biological fluid. In the body, it has a half-life of milliseconds due to its high affinity for double covalent bonds, preferably carbon-carbon, found in the polyunsaturated fatty acids that travel in albumin molecules. By this means it creates longer half-life metabolites called ozonides -reactive oxygen species and lipid oxidation products, including peroxides, hydroperoxides, and aldehydes. These molecules act as messengers of the biochemical and immunomodulatory effects of ozone, which are the key to ozone therapy. Ozone reacts immediately with biomolecules that have this double bond, and produces rapid oxidation that results in secondary molecules, which are the basis of its therapeutic action. The therapeutic efficacy of ozone is therefore due to the moderate and controlled oxidative stress produced by its reactions with various biological components 35 .",

Peroxides created by ozone administration oxidize cysteines 37,38 and show long-term antiviral effects that can further reduce viral load.

COVID-19 patients are usually hypoxic, so the oxygenating effect of ozone will be very beneficial. Some studies suggest that ozone may enhance the phagocytic activity of neutrophils, and the hydrogen peroxide released by monocytes and lymphocytes is known to be involved in intracellular signalling and capable of activating a tyrosine kinase that phosphorylates NF-\uf06bB and leads to the synthesis of different proteins 36 . NF-\uf06bB plays a key role in regulating the immune response to infection and the inflammatory response 37,38 .

In patients receiving MAH, oxygenation of vital organs and areas of ischaemia was improved, and respiratory, cardiac and renal functions were supported. If the patient's metabolic status does not deteriorate excessively after 3-4 days of MAH, increased antioxidant enzyme synthesis and haemoxygenase-1 induction can reduce the oxidative stress caused simultaneously by infection, inflammation, tissue necrosis, and dysmetabolism. Bocci and Brito 43 reported the case of a patient who developed ARDS in the postoperative period of aortic dissection and was treated with ECMO. Improvement was observed after initiation of MAH with a starting dose of 40 \uf06dg/ml and successive concentrations of 25 \uf06dg/ml on the following 2 days. Doctors in Italy have started treating COVID-19 patients with MAH. The studies have not yet been published, but remarkable benefits have been reported.
