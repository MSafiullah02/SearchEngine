            "text": "The recent letter by Drs Mungmunpuntipantipand Wiwanitkit 1 argues that our report about chest computed tomography (CT) findings in a pregnant woman with coronavirus disease (COVID-19) 2 are inconsistent with ''early'' COVID-19. In doing so, they discourage the consideration of CT findings when ruling out cases of COVID-19. Nevertheless, we think that their concern may have be guided by an incomplete understanding of the COVID-19 epidemic. As of 17 March 2020, more than 50,000 people have been confirmed with COVID-19 in Wuhan. During the period of the most severe increases in COVID-19 cases, the supply of nucleic acid detection kits could not meet the demands of the sharp increase in COVID-19 patients. So the diagnosis of COVID-19 followed the New Coronavirus Pneumonia Prevention and Control Program (fifthedition) A issued by the National Health Commission of China that took ''suspected cases with pneumonia imaging features'' as the clinical diagnosis case standard in Hubei Province. This allowed more COVID-19 patients to receive more timely treatment.",

            "text": "In earlier stages of the disease progression, the changes of chest CT scan were mainly congestion, edema, and exudation. For example, Shi et al. reported that ''COVID-19 manifests with chest CT imaging abnormalities, even in asymptomatic patients, with rapid evolution from focal unilateral to diffuse bilateral ground-glass opacities that progressed to or co-existed with consolidations''. 3 It is worth noting that only a single ground-glass opacity can be seen in some patients at an early stage, and the range significantly increases in the short-term re-examination. 4 When a patient's condition improves, a few fibrous streaks may appear. On the contrary, when the condition is more advanced, diffuse lesions appear in the lungs, and the density of both lungs increases, showing a ''white lung'', which seriously affects the patient's lung function. 4 Importantly, all diagnostic methods have disadvantages. In China, 29.2% of asymptomatic patients who were found to be infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and presented with either no or mild symptoms at the time of diagnosis by real-time reverse-transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test had a normal chest CT scan. 5 In addition, there were also some patients with positive chest CT findings who presented with a negative RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2. 6 Ai et al. showed that 60-93% of cases had an initial positive CT consistent with COVID-19 prior to (or parallel with) the initial positive RT-PCR results. Forty-two percent (24/ 57) of cases showed improvement in follow-up chest CT scans before the RT-PCR results turned negative. 7 Thus, chest CT may still be considered as one of the primary tools for detecting COVID-19 in epidemic areas.",
