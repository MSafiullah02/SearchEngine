We therefore calculated a range of plausible RRs for each summary OR using the formula RR = OR/(1-rb + (rb*OR)), where rb is the baseline risk of infection. We assumed baseline risks of SARS infection between 20% and 60%, estimated from the available cohort studies [20\u201322].

Large, well-designed studies would also enable subanalyses to investigate the role of mask use against different types of infections [54], clarify the circumstances under which rPPE use is most warranted, and yield valuable information about the role of different transmission modes.
