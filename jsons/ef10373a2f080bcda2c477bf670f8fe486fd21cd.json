            "text": "Viral respiratory tract infections are common in both children and adults. Mouse models of viral infection enable the characterization of host immune factors that protect against or promote virus infection; thus, mouse models are essential for interrogation of potential therapeutic targets. Moreover, they serve as critical models for the development of novel vaccine strategies. In this chapter, we describe methods for establishing mouse models of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and H1N1 influenza A virus infection. Protocols are provided for viral culture and expansion, plaque-forming assays for viral quantification, and infection of mice. Alternate modifications to the models are also described, and their potential impact is discussed.",

            "text": "Lower respiratory tract infections, including bronchitis and pneumonia, affect over 100 million individuals in the United States each year and are a leading cause of health-care encounters, particularly in the late fall and winter [1] . Bronchitis results from infection of the bronchial mucosa. It has been estimated that over 60% of cases are caused by viruses, of which the most common are influenza A and B, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza, coronaviruses, rhinoviruses, and human metapneumovirus [2, 3] . In comparison to bronchitis, pneumonia affects the more distal portions of the lung including the alveoli. Although it is widely accepted that the majority of pneumonia cases are caused by bacteria, recent evidence suggests that respiratory viruses are also common, either as the single cause or as a coinfecting pathogen [4] [5] [6] . Common viral pathogens in adults include influenza A and B, parainfluenza virus, rhinovirus, and coronavirus [4] [5] [6] [7] . These pathogens are also common causes of pediatric pneumonia, as is RSV [7, 8] .",

Despite the significant contributions of these models, inconsistencies among published reports call into question the impact of variable model approaches and how they affect outcome measures. Moreover, the lack of published methodologic details makes it impossible to address the impact of variability among murine models of viral infection [9, [12] [13] [14] . Here we provide detailed methodologic procedures for generation of RSV and influenza A virus working stock, and efficient viral plaque purification. Moreover, we provide methods for inducing RSV and H1N1 influenza A infection in adult mice and quantification of viral lung titers. Alternative approaches to the described methods are included where available.",

Despite reduced viral replication of RSV Line 19 compared to A2 in vivo, a dose-dependent increase in Gob5 and Muc5A expression along with increased IL-13 has been reported, suggesting the use of lower Line 19 inoculums in models designed to understand the role of RSV in allergic asthma [23] . Alternatively, higher doses may be warranted in models designed to assess disease pathology during acute primary infection.",

The pathogenicity and lethality of H1N1 influenza A vary between mouse strains and may also vary with the sex of the animals. A dose of 50 PFU per mouse is a good starting dose; however, before proceeding with a full experiment, a pilot experiment should be performed to determine the optimal dose. Several doses, varied by two-to tenfold, may be tried. For studies of acute inflammation and lung injury, we chose a dose that induces a 10-15% drop in body weight. Weight loss is generally greatest 7 days postinfection. Weight loss greater than 20% is commonly premorbid.",

Prepare eight dilution tubes (450 \u03bcL each) and two 12-well plates with 1 \u00d7 10 5 Hep-2 cells per ml per well.

As an infection control, live virus is placed in a petridish approximately 4 in. from a 40-W UV light on ice for 4 h. To ensure inactivation, UV-inactivated virus should be titrated on Hep-2 cells as described in Subheading 3.3 (see Note 15). Allow Hep-2 cells to become about 80% confluent in a T-162 flask, and check under microscope using a 10\u00d7 objective to verify. When cells are ready, remove media using a Pasteur pipet; wash the flask twice with 10 mL 37 \u00b0C 1\u00d7 PBS. 2. Add 2 mL of trypsin/EDTA, incubate until cells start to detach, and give the flask a tap occasionally. Once cells are detached, neutralize the trypsin with 8 mL of Hep-2 media, and pipet up and down to assure all cells are detached and in solution (see Note 8).",

It is important to get all of the FBS-containing media out of the wells. Add 500 \u03bcL of each virus dilution to each well. Do this in duplicate for each dilution.
