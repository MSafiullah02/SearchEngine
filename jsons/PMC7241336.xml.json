            "text": "Significant progress in the development of antiviral drugs has been achieved by targeting viral proteins with small molecules (Jordheim et al., 2013, Lou et al., 2014). For example, compounds like aciclovir and zidovudine block viral reverse transcriptase to treat herpes simplex virus and HIV infections, respectively, and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) inhibitors such as dasabuvir and sofosbuvir are used to treat hepatitis C virus infections (Nov\u00e1kov\u00e1 et al., 2018). More recently, the broad-spectrum RdRp inhibitor prodrug remdesivir (Gordon et al., 2020) has received U.S. Food and Drug Administration Emergency Use Authorization for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Meanwhile, targeting host proteins required for viral propagation is emerging as an attractive alternative that may circumvent the emergence of resistance (Bekerman and Einav, 2015). For example, maraviroc inhibits the human chemokine receptor CCR5, and is therefore used to treat multidrug-resistant HIV (Lieberman-Blum et al., 2008). More recently, pyrimidine biosynthesis has emerged as a potential host-targeting strategy for antivirals (Okesli et al., 2017). Here, we focus on devising a host-targeting antiviral approach for the treatment of RNA viruses, which cause many serious diseases such as viral hepatitis, influenza, Ebola, dengue, and COVID-19.",

            "text": "In mammalian cells, pyrimidine biosynthesis is a tightly regulated metabolic process. Two complementary pathways\u2014de novo biosynthesis and pyrimidine salvage\u2014are responsible for producing UTP and CTP for host as well as viral RNA synthesis (Figure 1\n). De novo pyrimidine biosynthesis is a resource-intensive process. In contrast, salvage occurs via phosphorylation of UMP and CMP derived from intracellular RNA degradation or via facilitated transport and phosphorylation of extracellular uridine, whose plasma concentration is tightly controlled in the low micromolar range (Traut, 1994). Recently, we discovered that GSK983, a broad-spectrum antiviral agent first reported in 2009 (Harvey et al., 2009), is a potent inhibitor of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH), a rate-limiting step in de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis (Deans et al., 2016). In the course of those unbiased genome-wide studies, we also found that knockdown of uridine/cytidine kinase 2 (UCK2) and uridine monophosphate/cytidine monophosphate kinase 1 (CMPK1) in the pyrimidine salvage pathway strongly sensitized cells to growth inhibition by GSK983 (Deans et al., 2016). This finding was consistent with the observation that most DHODH inhibitors lack antiviral efficacy in vivo despite high potency in vitro presumably due to salvage metabolism of circulating uridine by virus-infected cells (Bonavia et al., 2011, Cheung et al., 2017, Grandin et al., 2016, Smee et al., 2012, Wang et al., 2011, Xiong et al., 2020).",

To our surprise, we learned that the antiviral activity of CPU is due to its remarkable ability to deplete intracellular pyrimidine nucleotide pools via inhibition of salvage biosynthesis pathways.

In these and other reports, CPU was found to be remarkably well tolerated, whereas CPC was considerably more cytotoxic (Blaney et al., 1992, Ford et al., 1991, Song et al., 2001).

Among RdRp inhibitors, the nucleoside inhibitor (NI) class is the largest (Klumpp et al., 2006) and has progressed the furthest in studies against dengue virus (Lim et al., 2015). Many NIs are nucleoside analogs that rely on intracellular phosphorylation to form triphosphate substrates that block RdRp (Sofia et al., 2012). For example, the cytidine analog 4\u2032-azidocytidine (R1479) and its prodrug balapiravir (R1626) have been assessed for treating hepatitis C virus and later dengue virus infections (Chen et al., 2014, Klumpp et al., 2006). However, both compounds failed in clinical trials against dengue due to limited efficacy (Nguyen et al., 2013).",

Such replicon systems include the coding region needed for viral RNA translation and replication, while lacking the structural genes necessary for the production of viral particles. Consequently, viral genome replication is examined independently of viral entry and particle assembly (Kato and Hishiki, 2016). In this assay (Figure 7\n), the EC50 of R1479 alone was \u223c90 \u03bcM. Inhibition of de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis alone with GSK983 did not alter this value (\u223c96 \u03bcM), whereas addition of 250 \u03bcM CPU shifted it to \u223c56 \u03bcM. Targeting both the de novo and salvage pathways with a combination of 1 \u03bcM GSK and 250 \u03bcM CPU lowered the EC50 of R1479 by over 4-fold to \u223c19 \u03bcM. These results suggest that intracellular nucleotide depletion is the major driver of CPU's antiviral activity. Together, these findings highlight the potential of combining modulators of pyrimidine metabolism with inhibitors of viral genome replication.",

In particular, dengue causes hundreds of millions of symptomatic infections annually yet lacks any antiviral treatment, while the sole approved vaccine has limited use because of safety risks associated with vaccination of individuals not previously exposed to dengue (Lim et al., 2013, Sridhar et al., 2018). A series of high-throughput phenotypic cell-based screens have recently identified DHODH inhibition as a potent, broad-spectrum antiviral strategy in vitro (Hoffmann et al., 2011, Lucas-Hourani et al., 2013, Luthra et al., 2018, Wang et al., 2011). Furthermore, a DHODH inhibitor was recently shown to suppress SARS-CoV-2 in vitro (Xiong et al., 2020). However, DHODH inhibitors lose antiviral activity upon extracellular uridine addition due presumably to pyrimidine salvage (Deans et al., 2016). While a previous study has explored combining a DHODH inhibitor with guanosine analogs ribavirin or INX-08189 in a non-uridine supplemented cell culture dengue model (Yeo et al., 2015), the antiviral efficacy of a DHODH and a salvage inhibitor has not been previously reported despite interest (Luthra et al., 2018). Here, we found that a GSK983-CPU combination treatment effectively blocked dengue virus replication in the presence of physiological concentrations of extracellular uridine. At the same time, depletion of UTP and CTP led to a synergy between the CPU-GSK983 combination and RdRp inhibition.",

As the non-substrate analog 5\u2032-F-CPU did not deplete intracellular pyrimidines despite in vitro UCK2 inhibitory activity, our results suggest that CPU's activity in host cells is driven by its ability to block multiple targets in pyrimidine salvage rather than solely UCK2 inhibition.",

Intracellular nucleotide depletion appears correlated with antiviral activity given that the structurally unrelated nucleoside transport inhibitor DPY also suppressed intracellular nucleotide levels and viral replication (Figure S5). In addition, while 250 \u03bcM CPU in the absence of GSK983 did slightly potentiate the effects of R1479 on viral replication (Figure 7), this did not translate to decreased viral infection at the same time point (Figure S6A). Nevertheless, further investigation of inhibitory effects of CPU-TP on dengue RdRp is warranted. Indeed, as noted previously, NIs are the largest class of RdRp inhibitors (Klumpp et al., 2008). A multi-factorial approach that incorporates information about interactions with multiple host and viral enzymes will likely be useful for future SAR around CPU as this compound remained the most efficacious in our panel. In addition, efforts to develop specific inhibitors of UCK2 are needed. We previously identified such inhibitors through a high-throughput screen (Okesli-Armlovich et al., 2019); however, these inhibitors appeared to lack sufficient potency to synergize with GSK983 in antiviral models (data not shown).",

We note that the potential immunosuppressive effects of DHODH inhibitors may be viewed as helpful (Xiong et al., 2020) or harmful (Bonavia et al., 2011) in the treatment of viral infection. Meanwhile, many RdRp inhibitors have been evaluated in clinical trials against dengue. While a preliminary study combining CPU with a de novo synthesis inhibitor in vivo resulted in toxicity (Cysyk et al., 1995), there is precedent for combining inhibitors of de novo pyrimidine synthesis with nucleoside transport inhibitors in humans (Casper et al., 1991).

We identified a host-targeting antiviral strategy of modulating pyrimidine metabolism with analogs of cyclopentenyl uracil, an inhibitor of pyrimidine salvage, and GSK983, an inhibitor of de novo biosynthesis. This combination therapy also markedly increased the potency of R1479, an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) inhibitor, against dengue virus replication. At efficacious drug doses, the effect on the growth rates of uninfected cells was minimal. In light of the growing interest in RdRp inhibitors as antiviral agents, our findings shine light on a promising way to enhance their clinical utility by combining them with modulators of mammalian pyrimidine metabolism.\n",
