For example, these highly populated nations now only account for about 1% of the confirmed cases, even though they represent approximately one-third of the global population.",

This means that cases would decline with warming temperatures, independent of control efforts. However, this would also indicate that though COVID-19 might be peaking in the northern hemisphere this winter and spring, there is a real possibility that it will advance into tropical countries and the Southern Hemisphere later this year. In such case, some of the nations highlighted above might be vulnerable to the next wave of SARS CoV2 dissemination. SARS CoV2 is a new virus pathogen, and we need to appropriately assess its behavior over the span of a full year.",

Based on the levels of illness we have seen to date in the Northern Hemisphere, we are especially worried about the fate of thousands of dedicated doctors, nurses, and other health care providers.",
