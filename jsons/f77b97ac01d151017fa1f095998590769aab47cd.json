These proteins are critical components of the innate immune system and function to limit the severity and host range of virus infections. Here we review the current knowledge on the mechanisms of action of several restriction factors that affect multiple viruses at distinct stages of their life cycles. For example, APOBEC3G deaminates cytosines to hypermutate reverse transcribed viral DNA; IFITM3 alters membranes to inhibit virus membrane fusion; MXA/B oligomerize on viral protein complexes to inhibit virus replication; SAMHD1 decreases dNTP intracellular concentrations to prevent reverse transcription of retrovirus genomes; tetherin prevents release of budding virions from cells; Viperin catalyzes formation of a nucleoside analogue that inhibits viral RNA polymerases; and ZAP binds virus RNAs to target them for degradation. We also discuss countermeasures employed by specific viruses against these restriction factors, and mention secondary functions of several of these factors in modulating immune responses. These important examples highlight the diverse strategies cells have evolved to combat virus infections.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Antiviral restriction factors are cellular proteins that target specific stages of virus life cycles to limit virus replication. These factors generally target virus features or replication mechanisms that are broadly conserved within virus orders or families [1] . Restriction factors are a critical component of the innate immune response to virus infections, and are often essential for slowing virus replication in vivo until an adaptive immune response can further reduce or eliminate infections. Restriction factors are most often encoded by interferon (IFN) stimulated genes (ISGs), allowing the simultaneous induction of multiple factors via IFN to inhibit virus replication through distinct mechanisms [2] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 260, "end": 263, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 711, "end": 714, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "The multifactorial and sometimes redundant effect of multiple ISGencoded restriction factors on a specific virus is thought to be a critical adaptation to the evolutionary pressure provided by rapidly mutating viruses that can evolve to evade or counteract individual restriction factors [3] . Indeed, many examples have been described in which virus proteins induce the inactivation or degradation of particularly detrimental restriction factors. Likewise, viruses also utilize strategies to mask their recognition by restriction factors or mutate protein domains or genomic features that would otherwise interact with restriction factors. Virus mutations allowing evasion of restriction factors can also promote the counter-evolution of the host. Although host evolution occurs over much longer timescales than virus evolution, the relatively rapid evolution of restriction factors compared to other host genes in response to virus adaptations has been suggested to be an identifying signature of restriction factor genes [4] . The constant cycles of virus and host counter-evolution have been referred to as Red Queen interactions, a literary reference to the Red Queen's race in Lewis Carroll's Through the Looking-Glass in which running is required to stay in the same place. In addition to viral adaptations to individual restriction factors, pathogenic mammalian viruses usually encode broad antagonists of the IFN induction or signaling pathways to restrain the overall induction of restriction factors [5] . Given the inherent mutability of viruses and their mechanisms of immune evasion, a multipronged host immune response is thus required for defense, including numerous restriction factors. A list of known restriction factors active against human viruses and the specific virus life cycle stages at which they act are shown in Table 1 . The discovery of restriction factors has also provided us with a deeper understanding of why some cell types and some hosts are particularly susceptible to specific viruses. For example, restriction factors can contribute to the cell type specificity of some viruses by preventing infection of cell types in which certain restriction factors are highly expressed or activated under basal conditions. Likewise, restriction factors can influence the host range of specific viruses. This can occur when viruses evolve to evade a restriction factor in one host while remaining susceptible to homologous, but non-identical, factors in other hosts. Further, we are beginning to appreciate that human susceptibility to virus infections can be influenced by mutations in relevant restriction factor genes. To illustrate the numerous concepts cited above, we review here the current state of knowledge regarding several important restriction factors chosen from Table 1. These specific factors described below were selected because they provide compelling examples of virus inhibition involving unique enzymatic and non-enzymatic mechanisms of action against a broad array of distinct viruses at multiple stages of their life cycles. Indeed, they also provide illustration of the concepts of virus-host co-evolution, cell type-specific virus restriction, virus host range restriction, and effects of restriction factor mutations on severity of infection. In addition to better understanding of virus-host interactions, the discovery and mechanistic characterization of restriction factors may ultimately help to identify susceptible points in the replication cycles of specific viruses for targeted antiviral development.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 288, "end": 291, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1024, "end": 1027, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1511, "end": 1514, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1841, "end": 1848, "text": "Table 1", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing enzyme-catalytic polypeptide-like 3G (APOBEC3G or A3G), was identified in 2002 as an antiviral protein active against HIV-1 [6] , and it has also been shown to inhibit other retroviruses, as well as Hepatitis B virus (HBV) [6, 7] .

Using a deaminase-independent mechanism, A3G prevents viral reverse transcription [8, 21, 22] , while the deaminase-dependent functionality of A3G induces hypermutation of viral genomes via cytidine deamination [23] [24] [25] (Fig. 2) . Independent of its deaminase activity, A3G can bind to the retroviral RNA template or ssDNA wherein A3G can act as a physical block to viral reverse transcriptase (RT) [21, 26] . The ability of A3G to act as a block on the viral template strand has been linked to its ability to form an oligomer [22] . More specifically, A3G dimerization and oligomerization reduces its dissociation from viral ssDNA, suggesting that A3G oligomer formation promotes physical attachment to viral nucleic acids [8, 22] . Additionally, A3G has been shown to directly interact with RT, which could potentially decrease RT function or contribute to blockade of RT processivity, though the precise effect of this interaction is not fully understood [26] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 149, "end": 153, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 154, "end": 158, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 159, "end": 163, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 164, "end": 168, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 169, "end": 173, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 174, "end": 178, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 302, "end": 306, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 307, "end": 311, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 312, "end": 316, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 401, "end": 404, "text": "[8,", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 405, "end": 408, "text": "21,", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 409, "end": 412, "text": "22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 530, "end": 534, "text": "[23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 535, "end": 539, "text": "[24]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 540, "end": 544, "text": "[25]", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 724, "end": 728, "text": "[21,", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 729, "end": 732, "text": "26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 852, "end": 856, "text": "[22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 1049, "end": 1052, "text": "[8,", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1053, "end": 1056, "text": "22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 1283, "end": 1287, "text": "[26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 545, "end": 553, "text": "(Fig. 2)", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}], "section": "APOBEC3G"}, {"text": "In order to function effectively as a cytidine deaminase active against HIV-1, A3G first needs to be incorporated into progeny HIV-1 virions, and this ability to incorporate into virions distinguishes A3G from most other APOBEC family members. Specifically, A3G localizes with the viral genetic material and is subsequently encapsidated into nascent virions as they assemble [27, 28] . Encapsidation of A3G is facilitated through, and dependent on, the direct interaction of A3G with the nucleocapsid region of the HIV-1 Gag protein [29] [30] [31] . Once encapsidated, A3G interacts with the viral genome following subsequent infection by and uncoating of the virus in a new cell. A3G deaminates residues on the negative sense single stranded HIV-1 reverse transcribed DNA. This deamination causes deoxycytidine to deoxyuridine mutations leading to guanine-to-adenosine transformations once the virus completes reverse transcription [23] [24] [25] 32] . The high substitution rate of nucleic acids within the viral DNA leads to production of non-viable virus via introduction of unstable or nonfunctional amino acid substitutions and introduction of stop codons. A3G can also cause mutations in other retroviruses and HBV [7] . Interestingly, A3G-induced hypermutation is thought to contribute minimally to HIV-1 evolution rates due to an \"all or nothing\" phenomenon in which A3G-mutated viruses are usually non-viable [33, 34] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 375, "end": 379, "text": "[27,", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 380, "end": 383, "text": "28]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 533, "end": 537, "text": "[29]", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 538, "end": 542, "text": "[30]", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 543, "end": 547, "text": "[31]", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 933, "end": 937, "text": "[23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 938, "end": 942, "text": "[24]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 943, "end": 947, "text": "[25]", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 948, "end": 951, "text": "32]", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 1222, "end": 1225, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1419, "end": 1423, "text": "[33,", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 1424, "end": 1427, "text": "34]", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "APOBEC3G"}, {"text": "One of the first discovered examples of a viral countermeasure for a specific restriction factor is the degradation of A3G by the HIV-1 accessory protein known as Vif [6, 32] .

These proteins together form an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex that ubiquitinates and targets A3G for proteasomal degradation [35, 36] . Similarly, the HBV X protein (HBx) has been suggested to decrease A3G levels in infected cells through an exocytosis mechanism [37] . The existence of Vif and HBx as viral countermeasures to A3G, a potent antiviral restriction factor, highlights the ongoing evolutionary race between viruses and is also incorporated into nascent virion membranes to limit the fusogenicity/infectious potential of the virus. IFITM3 is primarily associated with inhibition of fusion at virus endosomes, but is shown here inhibiting fusion at the cell surface for graphical simplicity. SAMHD1 depletes dNTPs thereby inhibiting viral reverse transcription. APOBEC3G blocks reverse transcriptase processivity and also deaminates/ hypermutates viral ssDNA.

Although it does not possess any known enzymatic activity, IFITM3 utilizes several mechanisms to limit virus infection of cells. The first described and most extensively studied antiviral mechanism for IFITM3 is its ability to block virus entry (Fig. 1 ). For influenza virus, this inhibition was mapped to the virus fusion step, which occurs in cellular endosomes where IFITM3 is abundantly localized [40] [41] [42] . Indeed, while virus endocytosis occurs similarly in control cells versus cells expressing IFITM3, virus fusion and genome deposition into the cytoplasm does not occur when IFITM3 is present, and virus is likely degraded in lysosomes [41, 42] . Live-cell microscopy of infection with fluorescent molecule-loaded virus demonstrated that virus-to-endosome membrane hemifusion occurs normally in cells expressing IFITM3, suggesting that IFITM3 blocks the transition from membrane hemifusion to the opening of a fusion pore [41] . IFITM3 broadly inhibits the fusion of viruses, such as influenza virus, that enter cells via endocytosis, as well as HIV [38, [43] [44] [45] , indicating that it inhibits a highly conserved feature of the membrane fusion process even among viruses with divergent fusion proteins (Fig. 2) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 179, "end": 183, "text": "[38,", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 184, "end": 187, "text": "39]", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 592, "end": 596, "text": "[40]", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 597, "end": 601, "text": "[41]", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 602, "end": 606, "text": "[42]", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 842, "end": 846, "text": "[41,", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 847, "end": 850, "text": "42]", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 1128, "end": 1132, "text": "[41]", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 1256, "end": 1260, "text": "[38,", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 1261, "end": 1265, "text": "[43]", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 1266, "end": 1270, "text": "[44]", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 1271, "end": 1275, "text": "[45]", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 171, "end": 178, "text": "Fig. 1)", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}, {"start": 435, "end": 442, "text": "(Fig. 1", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}, {"start": 1414, "end": 1422, "text": "(Fig. 2)", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}], "section": "IFITM3"}, {"text": "Two studies have suggested that IFITM3 or related proteins can decrease membrane fluidity [46, 47] . Additionally, IFITM3 antiviral activity is neutralized by the membrane-destabilizing drug amphotericin B [46] or by specific membrane curvature-inducing lipids [47] . Together, these reports suggest that IFITM3 alters membranes to prevent virus fusion. Disruption of membrane cholesterol homeostasis was suggested as a possible mechanism underlying this effect [48] , but a role for cholesterol in inhibition of infections by IFITM3 has not been supported by subsequent studies [41, 49] . More recently, the aforementioned amphipathic helix within IFITM3 and its amphipathicity were shown to be required for antiviral activity, and specifically for inhibition of membrane fusion mediated by viral proteins [38] . Likewise, the palmitoylation sites adjacent to the amphipathic helix are critical for antiviral activity and are likely involved in targeting or anchoring the helix to membranes [39, [50] [51] [52] [53] . Given the ability of amphipathic helices to induce membrane curvature, it is possible that the IFITM3 amphipathic helix induces or stabilizes local membrane curvature in a manner that disfavors fusion. IFITM3 dimerization, which is also required for antiviral activity [54] , may serve to amplify the local effects of IFITM3 on membrane curvature. The antiviral function of IFITM3 has also been suggested to require interaction with a zinc metallopeptidase, ZMPSTE24, though ZMPSTE24 also functions as an antiviral restriction factor independently of IFITMs [55] .

The presence of these IFITMs reduces virion infectivity, likely through a mechanism that alters membrane fusion dynamics [44, 56] (Fig. 2 ).

It was also recently uncovered that the long-known resistance of human stem cells to virus infections is largely due to their IFN-independent expression of high levels of IFITMs that diminish as the cells differentiate [62] . Given the strong inhibition of infections by IFITM3, it is perhaps not surprising that strains of influenza virus and HIV-1 with reduced susceptibility to IFITM3 inhibition have been reported [63] [64] [65] . In the case of influenza virus, this reduced susceptibility correlates with adaptation of the hemagglutinin protein allowing the viruses to fuse at a higher pH and thus earlier in the endocytic pathway where IFITM3 is less abundant [64] . Resistance of HIV-1 to IFITM3 inhibition has also been mapped to mutations in its fusion glycoprotein [63, 66] .

Alternatively, Viperin acts against flaviviruses such as DENV and HCV by interaction with viral components. The binding of the Nterminal amphipathic helix to the HCV NS5A protein is required for HCV restriction [166] possibly by competing with a proviral host protein for binding with NS5A [166, 172] .

This indicates that Viperin may possess multiple independent mechanisms to prevent viral replication. Indeed, Viperin also plays a role in enhancing IFN production by plasmacytoid dendritic cells in response to TLR ligands in addition to its direct antiviral effects [174] . The relevance of this role in vivo is yet to be investigated. Additionally, the exact role of the conserved C-terminal domain remains unknown, although it is required for antiviral activity against several viruses [166] [167] [168] . Possible roles for the C-terminal domain could include dimerization and/or facilitating the catalytic function of the SAM domain. Consistent with this facilitating role, mutating Trp361 in the Cterminus, which is required for interacting with the cytosolic Fe-S protein assembly (CIA) machinery that installs the Fe-S cluster into Viperin [175] , abrogated the antiviral activity of Viperin [163] . It remains to be tested whether Trp361 and the CIA pathway are required for the SAM-dependent conversion of CTP to ddhCTP.

ZAP is most abundantly found in the cytoplasm and restricts a wide array of viruses through several distinct mechanisms. In humans, two alternatively spliced ZAP isoforms exist. These short and long isoforms are referred to as ZAP-S and ZAP-L. ZAP-L contains a defective PARP (poly ADP-ribose polymerase)-like domain that is not present in the ZAP-S isoform (Fig. 1) . This PARP domain is not enzymatically active but is important for the restriction of alphaviruses by ZAP-L, as mutation of this motif reduces its antiviral activity [177, 178] . Both variants of ZAP contain four CCCH (cysteine-cysteinecysteine-histidine) type zinc finger motifs at the N terminus, which are involved in binding viral RNA and mediating its degradation by recruiting the RNA processing exosome [176, 179, 180] (Fig. 1) . The N-terminus is also involved in hetero-or homodimerization of ZAP isoforms [181] . Though these isoforms are similar, they restrict distinct viruses and respond to IFNs variably. For example, ZAP-L restricts MLV and alphaviruses more effectively than ZAP-S [177, 178] , possibly due to both its PARP domain, as well as farnesylation (Fig. 1) , which uniquely targets ZAP-L to endolysosome membranes and promotes its antiviral activity [182] . Another discrepancy between S and L isoforms is that although both isoforms are induced by IFNs, ZAP-S is more highly increased by IFN treatment and virus infection [183, 184] . Although ZAP-S appears to have less direct virus restriction activity than ZAP-L, ZAP-S also associates with the virus sensor RIG-I and aids in the production of type I IFNs by boosting RIG-I signaling [185] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 167, "end": 172, "text": "[176]", "ref_id": "BIBREF175"}, {"start": 709, "end": 714, "text": "[177,", "ref_id": "BIBREF176"}, {"start": 715, "end": 719, "text": "178]", "ref_id": "BIBREF177"}, {"start": 953, "end": 958, "text": "[176,", "ref_id": "BIBREF175"}, {"start": 959, "end": 963, "text": "179,", "ref_id": "BIBREF178"}, {"start": 964, "end": 968, "text": "180]", "ref_id": "BIBREF179"}, {"start": 1058, "end": 1063, "text": "[181]", "ref_id": "BIBREF180"}, {"start": 1240, "end": 1245, "text": "[177,", "ref_id": "BIBREF176"}, {"start": 1246, "end": 1250, "text": "178]", "ref_id": "BIBREF177"}, {"start": 1418, "end": 1423, "text": "[182]", "ref_id": "BIBREF181"}, {"start": 1591, "end": 1596, "text": "[183,", "ref_id": "BIBREF182"}, {"start": 1597, "end": 1601, "text": "184]", "ref_id": "BIBREF183"}, {"start": 1806, "end": 1811, "text": "[185]", "ref_id": "BIBREF184"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 533, "end": 541, "text": "(Fig. 1)", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}, {"start": 969, "end": 977, "text": "(Fig. 1)", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}, {"start": 1316, "end": 1324, "text": "(Fig. 1)", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}], "section": "ZAP"}, {"text": "Despite their differences, ZAP-S and -L both restrict a wide range of viruses including alphaviruses, filoviruses, Hepatitis B virus, influenza A virus, and retroviruses [176, 183, [186] [187] [188] [189] [190] [191] [192] .

In fact, ZAP's ability to bind viral RNA has been appreciated for some time but how ZAP broadly recognizes foreign RNAs was unclear. Recent seminal work demonstrated that the nucleotide composition of viral genomes, particularly the presence of CG dinucleotides, was the key contributor to ZAP mediated restriction of viruses [194] . Vertebrate genomes have a lower than expected numbers of CG dinucleotides, likely due to C to T mutations over the course of evolution. This dearth of CG dinucleotides is mimicked in many RNA virus genomes, including HIV-1, but the driving evolutionary force behind this was previously a mystery [194, 195] . Examining HIV-1 with codons altered to contain an increased CG content while preserving the amino acid code showed that this altered virus replicated poorly in cells. Using an siRNA screen, it was determined that ZAP was responsible for restriction of the CGcontaining virus, i.e., virus replication could be restored by depletion of ZAP [194] .

Conversely, identifying mutations in humans or other species that expand restriction capabilities of individual factors via evasion of viral countermeasures could provide additional insights into infection susceptibilities and the evolving interaction interfaces between viruses and host factors. Overall, the investigation of cellular antiviral restriction factors will continue to critically inform our understanding of virus-host interaction dynamics, and we expect that appreciation of the medical importance of these factors will continue to grow.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 443, "end": 447, "text": "[61,", "ref_id": "BIBREF60"}, {"start": 448, "end": 452, "text": "198]", "ref_id": "BIBREF197"}, {"start": 608, "end": 612, "text": "[61,", "ref_id": "BIBREF60"}, {"start": 613, "end": 617, "text": "198]", "ref_id": "BIBREF197"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Perspectives"}, {"text": "The Transparency document associated with this article can be found, in online version.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Transparency document"}], "bib_entries": {"BIBREF0": {"ref_id": "b0", "title": "Pan-viral specificity of IFN-induced genes reveals new roles for cGAS in innate immunity", "authors": [{"first": "J", "middle": ["W"], "last": "Schoggins", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "D", "middle": ["A"], "last": "Macduff", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "N", "middle": [], "last": "Imanaka", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "M", "middle": ["D"], "last": "Gainey", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "B", "middle": [], "last": "Shrestha", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "J", "middle": ["L"], "last": "Eitson", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "K", "middle": ["B"], "last": "Mar", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "R", "middle": ["B"], "last": "Richardson", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "A", "middle": ["V"], "last": "Ratushny", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "V", "middle": [], "last": "Litvak", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "R", "middle": [], "last": "Dabelic", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "B", "middle": [], "last": "Manicassamy", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "J", "middle": ["D"], "last": "Aitchison", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "A", "middle": [], "last": "Aderem", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "R", "middle": ["M"], "last": "Elliott", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "A", "middle": [], "last": "Garcia-Sastre", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "V", "middle": [], "last": "Racaniello", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "E", "middle": ["J"], "last": "Snijder", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2014, "venue": "", "volume": "505", "issn": "", "pages": "691--695", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF1": {"ref_id": "b1", "title": "A diverse range of gene products are effectors of the type I interferon antiviral response", "authors": [{"first": "J", "middle": ["W"], "last": "Schoggins", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "S", "middle": ["J"], "last": "Wilson", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "M", "middle": [], "last": "Panis", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "M", "middle": ["Y"], "last": "Murphy", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "C", "middle": ["T"], "last": "Jones", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "P", "middle": [], "last": "Bieniasz", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "C", "middle": ["M"], "last": "Rice", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2011, "venue": "Nature", "volume": "472", "issn": "", "pages": "481--485", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF2": {"ref_id": "b2", "title": "Evolutionary conflicts between viruses and restriction factors shape immunity", "authors": [{"first": "N", "middle": ["K"], "last": "Duggal", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "M", "middle": [], "last": "Emerman", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2012, "venue": "Nat.
