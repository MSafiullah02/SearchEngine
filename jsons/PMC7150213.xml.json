The VX-2 tumor, spontaneous endometrial adenocarcinoma, monoclonal gammopathies, nephroblastoma, lymphoblastic leukemia, and malignant fibroma are all considered animal models of human neoplastic disease. The VX-2 carcinoma results from the malignant transformation of the viral-induced Shope papilloma. The tumor induces fulminating hypercalcemia, within 4 weeks of implantation (Young et al., 1978). Endometrial adenocarcinoma is most common in aged rabbits, with an incidence of 79% being reported in a colony of 5-year-old rabbits (Baba and von Haam, 1972). The other rabbit models of neoplasia described above are induced models. Monoclonal gammopathies can be induced in the rabbit in response to specific bacterial components (Hurvitz, 1975). Nephroblastoma is induced by administration of ethylnitrosourea to pregnant does (Haenichen and Stavrou, 1980). Finally, transgenic technology has been utilized to create a transgenic rabbit that develops acute \u03b2-lymphoblastic leukemia as a weanling (Sethupathi et al., 1993).",

In general, rabbits will drink more water when consuming dry, pelleted feed than when consuming foodstuffs high in moisture, such as fresh greens.

The doe normally nurses the kits once daily for several minutes, usually in the early morning or in the evening, regardless of how many kits are present or how many times they attempt to suckle. Milk yield is normally between 160 and 220 gm/day. Maximum output occurs at 2 weeks following kindling and then declines during the fourth week. Rabbit milk contains approximately 12.5% protein, 13% fat, 2% lactose, and 2.5% minerals. Nursing may last 5 to 10 weeks. Kits may begin consuming solid food by 3 weeks of age, with weaning generally occurring by 5 to 8 weeks of age.",

A small percentage of papillomas are transformed into squamous cell carcinoma, indicating that this virus is oncogenic. The virus has been transmitted experimentally by arthropods. Therefore, arthropod control could be used as a means to prevent the disease from being transmitted to domestic rabbits. This virus is used extensively as a model for the study of oncogenic virus biology and as a model for the induction of protective immunity against papillomaviruses (Salmon et al., 1997; Sundaram et al., 1998).",

Many colonies of rabbits are serologically positive, and rotavirus can be isolated readily from rabbit feces. However, attempts to experimentally produce clinical disease have had variable results. Mild diarrhea is usually seen, but in some studies there has been significant mortality. It is probable that rotavirus is only mildly pathogenic in rabbits and may require the presence of other organisms in order to produce clinical disease. In combined experimental infections with both rotavirus and Escherichia coli, the inoculation of both organisms led to more serious clinical signs than when given alone, indicating that rotavirus may have been a more significant determinant in the manifestation of this disease (Thouless et al., 1996). These investigators also showed that older rabbits were naturally more resistant to the combined infection with rotavirus and E. coli. Very young rabbits appear to be protected from rotavirus infection by passive immunity, when present, but are quite susceptible when there is none (Schoeb et al., 1986). Rabbits of weaning age seem to be the most susceptible. This is also the time when they are most likely to be subjected to diet changes that may contribute to a change in microbial flora.",

In addition, outbreaks have recently been reported in the United States and Mexico. The incubation period may be as short as 1 or 2 days, and sudden death with no previous signs is not uncommon. Clinical signs may included lethargy, anorexia, and fever. Periportal hepatic necrosis is the only consistent microscopic lesion, and the animals die due to disseminated intravascular coagulation with deep venous thromboses.

(1963) demonstrated that immunity occurs following a light infection with E. stiedae. In the rabbit, immunity to Eimeria may be lifelong (Pell\u00e9rdy, 1965; Niilo, 1967). Prevention of hepatic coccidiosis with sulfaquinozaline in the feed (250 ppm) was shown to prevention infection in the face of experimental challenge with 100,000 sporulated oocysts (Joyner et al., 1987). Sulfonamides have been shown effective against Eimeria spp. (Jankiewicz, 1945; Horton-Smith, 1947; Lund, 1954b; Hagen, 1958; Tsunoda et al., 1968). Development of the organism was arrested by treatment with 0.02% sulfamerazine sodium administered continually in the drinking water (Peterson, 1950). Thorough sanitation of potentially contaminated surfaces is critical to control of coccidiosis.",

The preweanling rabbits develop immunity subsequent to infection with the nonpathogenic strain and are then resistant to wild-type strains of E. magna at 35 days of age (Drouet-Viard et al., 1997). Prevention and control of infection can be accomplished by providing 0.02% sulfamerazine or 0.05% sulfaquinoxaline in the drinking water (Kraus et al., 1984). A combination of sulfaquinoxaline, strict sanitation, and elimination of infected animals has been shown to eliminate intestinal coccidiosis from a rabbit breeding colony (Pakes and Gerrity, 1994).

The KOH scraping should be placed in the KOH for 30\u201340 min and then gently heated for 10 min prior to examination for mycelia or arthrospores. In either case, scrapings should be taken from the periphery of the lesion. Dermatophytosis can also be confirmed by viewing the lesion under a Wood's lamp. Some isolates of Microsporum fluoresce under Wood's lamp illumination. However, Trichophyton and some Microsporum isolates do not fluoresce, thus a negative result with the Wood's lamp does not rule out dermatophytosis. Finally, samples of hair plucked from the edge of the lesion can be cultured for dermatophytes, using special media such as dermatophyte test media (DTM) or Sabouraud's agar.

Ultrastructural studies of organism morphology indicate that different Pneumocystis species or subspecies may exist between rabbits, rats, and mice (Nielsen et al., 1998). It is generally a harmless microorganism in immunocompetent individuals and has been identified in clinically normal rabbits (Mata, 1959; Sheldon, 1959a; Soulez et al., 1989; Cundiff et al., 1994). Animals with a less than fully functional immune system are susceptible to more severe infections. In rabbits, respiratory disease accompanied by pulmonary lesions has been reported in young or debilitated animals (Blazek, 1960; Blazek and Pokorny, 1963; Poelma and Broeckhuizen, 1972; Soulez et al., 1989).

Diagnosis is made based on clinical signs, history of recent restraint, struggling or other trauma, and palpation or radiographic analysis of the vertebral column. Euthanasia of affected animals is usually warranted. Moderate cases (subluxation with spinal edema) may resolve over time. The decision to euthanatize should be based on severity of clinical signs. Supportive care includes regular expression of the urinary bladder and prevention and treatment of decubital ulcers.

In affected animals the lower incisors often extend anterior to the upper incisors and protrude from the mouth, while the upper primary incisors grow past the lower incisors and curl within the mouth (Fig. 14\n).

Some reports suggest that the condition is associated with inherited achondroplasia of the hip and shoulder, while others indicate that a recessively inherited anteversion of the femoral head can be involved (Lindsey and Fox, 1974, 1994). In the Dutch breed, splay leg has been associated with either a single recessive gene with incomplete penetrance or as a polygenic condition with environmental modulation (Joosten et al., 1981). It has been further speculated that some cases of splay leg are the result of teratologic malformations (Flatt et al., 1974).",
