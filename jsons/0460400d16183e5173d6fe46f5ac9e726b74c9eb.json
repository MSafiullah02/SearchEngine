            "text": "One of the key challenges at the forefront of today's electron microscopy research is to observe processes at the nanoscale under relevant conditions. For samples from the materials science, this is accomplished by in situ electron microscopy. Movies-even at atomic resolution-are recorded of processes at high temperatures, in gaseous environments, or in liquids, while carefully taking into account the effect of the electron beam. For most biological samples, the electron beam impact prevents acquiring the time-lapse date, and research is mostly directed toward correlative light-and electron microscopy often using proteins labels. Single electron microscopic images are preferentially recorded in amorphous ice, or liquid. A conference discussing these topics was held for the second time at the INM-Leibniz Institute for New Materials on October 14-15, 2014, in Saarbr\u20ac ucken, Germany. The conference on in situ and correlative electron microscopy CISCEM 2014 aimed to bring together an interdisciplinary group of scientists from the fields of biology, materials science, chemistry, and physics to discuss future directions of electron microscopy research. The venue was the Aula at Saarland University.",

Ideally, all three imaging modalities are applied to frozen-hydrated samples, ensuring that they are studied in the most lifelike state that is physically possible to achieve. Vitrified aqueous samples are very radiation sensitive and consequently, cryo-EM images must be recorded at minimal electron beam exposures, limiting their signal-to-noise ratio. Therefore, the high-resolution information of images of unstained and vitrified samples must be retrieved by averaging-based noise reduction, which requires the presence of repetitive structure. Averaging can obviously not be applied to pleomorphic structures such as organelles and cells (Fitting Kourkoutis et al., 2012; Leis et al., 2009) . Electron crystallography requires the existence of two-dimensional crystals, natural or synthetic, and averaging is straightforward given the periodic arrangement of the molecules under scrutiny. In principle, electron crystallography is a high-resolution technique as demonstrated successfully with a number of structures, particularly membrane proteins. Often, however, the same structures can be studied by X-ray crystallography, which tends to be faster and can attain atomic resolution more easily.",

The amount of material needed is minute, and some degree of heterogeneity, compositional or conformational, is tolerable since image classification can be used for further purification in silico. It is particularly successful in structural studies of very large macromolecular complexes where the traditional methods often fail. In principle, single-particle analysis can attain nearatomic resolution, but in practice, this often remains an elusive goal. This is changing, however, with the advent of new technology, particularly detectors with improved performance. But even intermediate resolution (subnanometer) structures of very large complexes can provide an excellent basis for hybrid or integrative approaches in which high-resolution structures of components and orthogonal data, such as distance restraints, are used to generate atomic models.",

In order to obtain three-dimensional reconstructions of objects with unique topologies, it is necessary to acquire data sets with different angular orientations of the sample by physical tilting. The challenge is to obtain large numbers of projections covering as wide a tilt range as possible and, at the same time, to minimize the cumulative electron dose. This is achieved by means of elaborate automated acquisition procedures. Electron cryotomography can provide medium-resolution, three-dimensional images of a wide range of biological structures from isolated supramolecular assemblies to organelles and whole cells. It allows the visualization of molecular machines in their unperturbed functional environments (in situ structural biology) and ultimately the mapping of entire molecular landscapes (visual proteomics; Robinson et al., 2007) .",

Image denoising can improve the signal-to-noise ratio by reducing the noise while preserving the features of interest. Segmentation separates the structures of interest from the background and allows their three-dimensional visualization and quantitative analysis. Larger molecular structures can be identified in tomograms by pattern recognition methods using a template structure, and once their location and orientation is determined, identical structures can be extracted computationally and averaged.

These include particles (gold, quantum dots) to highlight endogenous proteins, but also genetically encoded probes, as well as traditionally used stains for light microscopy (LM) that aid in electron microscopy (EM)-analysis of samples. Probes that can be detected only in a single modality and require image overlay, as well as combinatorial probes that can be visualized both at LM and EM will be discussed. In addition, published (Ravelli et al., 2013) and new approaches for large-scale EM to visualize macromolecules and organelles in the context of organized cell systems and tissues will be covered (www.nanotomy.nl). Matching the areas of acquisition in CLEM and EM will not only increase understanding of the molecules in the context, but also is a straightforward manner to combine the LM and EM image data. Covering a wide variety of probes and approaches for image overlay will help to enable (new) users to implement CLEM to better understand how molecules (mal)function in biology.

In the upper-left row, a dividing cell (1 in >100) is identified based on its DNA staining (blue). With the aid of embossed coverslips (for full details, see Hodgson et al., 2014a) the dividing cell can be traced back in the EM and studied at higher resolutions. labelling to trace back objects of interest ( Figure 2 ; Hodgson et al., 2014b) , this allows for relatively high immunolabeling efficiencies but is almost impossible in combination with live cell imaging. The third is based on cryofixation to obtain the best possible preservation of ultrastructure (Verkade, 2008; Brown et al., 2012) . This allows us to capture events that would be lost because of chemical fixation (e.g., membrane tubules). It allows for live cell imaging, but immunolabeling options are limited. Understanding the fundamental properties of macromolecules has enhanced the development of emerging technologies used to improve biomedical research. Currently, there remains a critical need for innovative platforms that can illuminate the function of biological objects in a native liquid environment. To address this need, we have developed an in situ TEM approach to visualize the dynamic behavior of biomedically relevant macromolecules at the nanoscale. Newly designed silicon nitride-based devices containing integrated microwells were used to enclose active macromolecular specimens in liquid for TEM imaging purposes ( Figures 3A, B ). With each specimen tested, the integrated microwells could adequately maintain macromolecules in discrete local environments (Dukes et al., 2014) while enabling thin liquid layers to be produced for high-resolution imaging purposes as previously exemplified using gold nanorods (Dukes et al., 2013) . This success permitted us to utilize the integrated microwell-designed microchips to examine actively transcribing rotavirus assemblies having native contrast (Dukes et al., 2014) . In developing biochemical experiments to assess viral attributes, we first needed to manufacture competent viral specimens. To accomplish this objective, we purified simian rotavirus double-layered particles (DLPs) (strain SA11-4 F) from monkey kidney MA104 cells, as previously described (Dukes et al., 2014) . The proteins that comprised the purified DLPs were analyzed using SDS-PAGE and silver staining ( Figure 4A ). We found that DLPs produced in the MA104 cells contained four proteins (VP1, VP2, VP3, and VP6) and that VP4 and VP7 were absent from the formed particles. To verify that our purified DLPs could transcribe viral RNAs, we utilized an in vitro messenger RNA (mRNA) synthesis assay. Each reaction mixture contained DLPs, each NTP, and [ 32 P]-UTP, and they were allowed to incubate for 30 min at 37\u00b0C ( Figure 4A , +ATP). Negative control reactions also contained each transcription cocktail component except ATP ( Figure 4A , \u00c0ATP). Radiolabeled mRNA products were detected in the reaction mixtures containing a complete transcription cocktail, and no radiolabeled products were detected in the reaction mixtures lacking ATP. Therefore, this functional analysis confirmed that the purified DLPs used for subsequent imaging analysis were enzymatically active.",

An aliquot of each transcription cocktail was added onto Ni-NTA-coated SiN microchips that were previously decorated with His-tagged protein A and IgG polyclonal antibodies against the VP6 capsid protein (Degen et al., 2012; Gilmore et al., 2013) (Figure 4A , schematic). The fluidic microchamber that contained the antibody-bound transcribing DLPs was assembled into the Poseidon specimen holder. Active DLPs were examined using a FEI Spirit Bio-Twin TEM equipped with a LaB 6 filament and operating at 120 kV. Images of transcribing DLPs were recorded using an Eagle 2 k HS charge-coupled device (CCD) camera under low-dose conditions (approximately 0.5 electrons/\u00c5 2 ) to minimize beam damage to the viral specimens. The resulting images revealed dynamic attributes of RV pathogens in liquid at 3-nm resolution ( Figure 4B ). We could also distinguish discrete strands emerging from numerous DLPs. These strands had characteristic shapes and dimensions consistent with being single-stranded viral mRNA transcripts ( Figure 4B , 1-4, right panels). No strands were identified in images of our negative control transcription reactions that lacked ATP. We could subsequently use the RELION software package to compute 3D reconstructions of the active DLPs from a single image ( Figure 4C ). The interiors of the DLP cores revealed movements indicative of protein rearrangements during mRNA synthesis. The spatial distribution of internalized nanoparticles (NPs), and of membrane proteins tagged with NP labels were studied by imaging whole and hydrated cells with an environmental scanning microscope (ESEM), equipped with a scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) detector ( Figure 5 ). COS7 fibroblast, A549 lung cancer, and SKBR3 breast cancer cells were grown on silicon microchips with silicon nitride (SiN) membrane windows. One ESEM-STEM study followed the fate of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) within cells, an important topic in view of the high potential of AuNPs for medical applications. Here, A549 cells took up serum protein coated AuNPs of 10-, 15-, or 30-nm diameters. One or two days after the AuNP uptake cells were fixed and investigated with ESEM-STEM Figure 5 A schematic of ESEM-STEM of whole cells in a wet state.

The dimensions of 1,106 AuNP-storing lysosomes were determined from 145 whole cells, within a total time (including imaging and analysis) of only 80 h. This study revealed a statistically relevant enlargement effect on the size of the lysosomes of the 30-nm AuNP compared to the smaller NPs . Studied membrane proteins included the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and the related receptor tyrosine kinase HER2. The mapping of monomers and dimers of these two receptors is important for basic research, as well as for the study of the molecular mechanisms involved in certain anti-cancer drugs. Membrane-bound EGFR or HER2 on live cells were labeled with probes consisting of small protein ligands and AuNPs or fluorescent quantum dots (QDs). After fixation, EGF-AuNP labeled cells were examined directly with ESEM-STEM ( Figure 6B ), whereas cells labeled with QD probes were studied with correlative fluorescence microscopy and ESEM-STEM ( Figure 2C and D). In all cell lines, significant fractions of the labeled receptors appeared as dimers and in small clusters. Hundreds of ESEM-STEM images were recorded of several tens of cells providing nanometer-scaled data from thousands of labels, which were analyzed and quantified by automated image software algorithm. In addition, correlative microscopy confirmed the heterogeneity of nonisogenic cancer cells, manifesting in large variations of EGFR and HER2 expression and distinct spatial distributions on the cell membrane.",

            "text": "In conclusion, ESEM-STEM is an exciting EM methodology for analytic studies of whole cells in their hydrated state with nanometer resolution and in very short timeframes. to combine the two techniques in one instrument, we are now routinely able to register and-using fluorescence probes-accurately localize regions of interest anywhere on a standard EM grid while using most types of TEM sample preparations. We have also shown that we can use intrinsic fluorescence to provide complementary information that is not accessible by EM alone. However, light and electron microscopy remain vastly different methods, with an accordingly large gap in the relevant length scales. In order to bridge this gap, we have recently begun to combine super-resolution light microscopy with TEM. All positive-strand RNA viruses replicate in the cytoplasm in distinct membranous compartments serving as replication factories. Membranes building up these factories are recruited from different sources and serve as platforms for the assembly of multi-subunit protein complexes (the replicase) that catalyze the amplification of the viral RNA genome. In this study, we found that hepatitis C virus (HCV), a major causative agent of chronic liver disease, induces profound remodeling of primarily endoplasmic reticulum (ER)derived membranes. By using correlative light and electron microscopy (CLEM), we observed that HCV triggers the formation of double membrane vesicles (DMVs), surrounding lipid droplets and residing in close proximity of the ER ( Figure 9A ; Romero-Brey et al., 2012) . Furthermore, by means of electron tomography (ET), we showed that these DMVs emerge as protrusions from ER tubules ( Figure 9B ; Romero-Brey et al., 2012) . CLEM allowed us to confirm the important contribution of one of the HCV nonstructural proteins (NS5A) to the formation of DMVs ( Figure 10A ; unpublished data). Importantly, inhibitors that are currently tested in clinical trials and targeting NS5A disrupt biogenesis of these HCV-induced mini-organelles and completely block virus replication ( Figure 10B ; Berger et al., 2014) .",

We observed the formation of amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC) over the entire range of conditions. In addition, we found that all common crystalline phases of calcium carbonate, including calcite, vaterite, and aragonite could form directly. Multiple phases often formed within a single experiment and the direct formation of the crystalline phases occurred under conditions in which ACC also readily formed. These observations demonstrate that multiple phases of calcium carbonate can form directly from solution without the intermediate stage of ACC. For all phases measured, we found radial/edge growth rates after nucleation were linear with respect to time, showing that growth was reaction limited. Beyond these direct formation pathways, we observed transformation from ACC to aragonite and vaterite, but, significantly, not to calcite ( Figure 11 ). In these observations, ACC transformed directly to the crystalline phases rather than undergoing a process of dissolution and reprecipitation. Nucleation of the second phase began on or just below the surface of the ACC particle and was preceded by a brief period of particle shrinkage, perhaps associated with expulsion of water. These formation pathways were confirmed by collecting diffraction information of the various phases of calcium carbonate.",

We found that primary particles of ferrihydrite interacted with one another through translational and rotational diffusion until a near-perfect lattice match was obtained either with true crystallographic alignment or across a twin plane ( Figure 12 ). Oriented attachment (OA) then occurred through a sudden jump-to-contact, demonstrating the existence of an attractive potential driving the OA process. Following OA, the resulting interfaces expanded through ion-by-ion attachment at a curvaturedependent rate. However, when a significant mismatch existed between the sizes of the two particles and attachment failed to occur over extended periods of particle interaction, the larger crystals still grew in size through Ostwald ripening, resulting in the disappearance of the smaller ones. In contrast to the clear role played by OA in the case of ferrihydrite, analysis of the assembly of akaganeite nanorods to form single-crystal hematite spindles showed that attachment did not result in coalignment; rather, the initial mesocrystal was disordered and recrystallized over time to become a well-ordered single crystal. Calcium carbonate exhibited still a different style of particle-mediated growth. In this system, we also observed that nanoparticles interacted and underwent aggregation events; however, the smallest particles often appeared to be amorphous, with crystallinity presumably arising as a result of attachment to the larger crystalline particle ( Figure 13 ).",

Here, we demonstrated for the first time that liquid-cell TEM is a relevant method to follow the (bio)degradation of iron oxide NPs in a solution mimicking the intracellular environment to which they are exposed during their life cycle in the organism (Figure 15 ). Biominerals possess shapes, structures, and properties not found in synthetic minerals. These defining characteristics arise from the interplay of the mineral with a macromolecular matrix, which directs crystal nucleation and growth (Lowenstam & Weiner, 1989; Mann, 2001) . Within this threedimensional biomolecular assembly, the developing mineral interacts with acidic macromolecules, either dissolved in the crystallization medium or associated with insoluble framework polymers such as chitin or collagen (Palmer et al., 2008) . Although acidic macromolecules are known to affect growth habits and phase selection, or even to completely inhibit precipitation in solution (Sommerdijk & With, 2008; Meldrum & C\u20ac olfen, 2008; Gower, 2008) , little is known about the role of matrix-immobilized acidic macromolecules in directing mineralization. This lack of understanding is, in part, due to the difficulty of studying biomimetic mineralization systems with sufficient spatial and temporal resolution (Dey et al., 2010) . However, liquid phase transmission electron microscopy (LP-TEM) can visualize events in situ in thin liquid volumes (about 500 nm in height) confined within two electron transparent silicon nitride (SiN) membranes. Here, we use LP-TEM to visualize the nucleation and growth of CaCO 3 in a biomimetic matrix of polystyrene sulfonate (PSS). In particular, we utilized a dual inlet flow stage where we started out with a CaCl 2 solution in the confined cell, after which carbonate was introduced through in-diffusion of vapor released from the decomposition of solid (NH 4 ) 2 CO 3 (mainly CO 2 (g) and NH 3 (g) ) via the second inlet port. Within minutes, we directly observed the nucleation of randomly distributed vaterite nanoparticles over the surface, which we attribute to heterogeneous nucleation on the SiN.",

The strong influence of local atomic structure offers the possibility of designing new components with tailored and unique properties. Electron microscopes offer the possibility of correlating the structure to transport properties with a spatial resolution that reaches the atomic scale. A knowledge platform of how to design new materials by combining experiments and theory can thus be established. In addition, inserting a scanning tunnelling or an atomic force microscope in the electron microscope enables studies of dynamic events. This talk will cover aspects of in situ studies using manipulators with high spatial precision in electron microscopes, including experiments in low-vacuum conditions and give examples from different material systems. Using fluid stages in the TEM, in situ observations of dynamic processes in liquids can be made with nanometer and even atomic spatial resolutions. The flexibility of this approach for studying liquid phase reactions relies upon both the possibility of obtaining information by using well established as well as novel capabilities in the TEM platform and the possibility of fine-tuning the design of the experiment. Fluid stages are designed to fit in any TEM, allowing for local chemical information in microscopes equipped with electron energy loss spectrometers, subangstrom spatial resolution using Cs-correction, or high temporal resolution on the 10 ns to 1 \u03bcs range, if using a dynamic TEM (DTEM). Additional flexibility comes from the design of the fluid stage, where the liquid chamber is created and separated from the high vacuum in the microscope column using two microfabricated chips. Thus, the experiment layout can be adapted for each sample by using chips designed for a specific application including different configurations of chips for continuous flow applications, mixing of two chemicals or with electrical contacts. As the technique is increasingly refined, the challenge now becomes obtaining quantifiable and reproducible data that is free from beam-induced artifacts. Once the effect of the electron beam on the liquid sample is calibrated, reliable information on the fundamental mechanisms behind the colloidal synthesis of nanostructured materials, self-assembly or the structural processes during battery operation, and even biological conformational changes can be uncovered, just to name a few.",

            "text": "Studying liquid samples in the TEM represents specific challenges as compared to the study of crystalline/amorphous solid specimens. Solutions decompose upon radiolysis and chemical species are generated in the liquid phase and interact with the sample, most times beyond the observation area since they are mobile by nature. Factors such as the electron dose applied to the sample (Zheng et al., 2009; Woehl et al., 2012; , accelerating voltage (Abellan et al., 2014a) and imaging mode (e.g., TEM, STEM, SEM; Abellan et al., 2014a; , liquid thickness (Jungjohann et al., 2013) , and solution composition strongly determine the amount of radiation damage produced, and their effect must be calibrated for. In many systems, as for the case of an aqueous Ag precursor solution, radiolysis of deionized water in the TEM leads to the nucleation and growth of particles (Woehl et al., 2012; Abellan et al., 2014a) . As an example, Figure 18 illustrates (Abellan et al., 2014a) . For the specific case of growth of nanomaterials, using solvents with higher chemical complexity, such as organic solvents, leads to the production of a larger variety of radicals (as compared to water) increasing the number of chemical reactions involved. Therefore, understanding how these solutions are affected by the electron beam becomes even more crucial. Besides the study of particle growth, the damaging effect of the electron beam can be used for other applications, such as an effective tool for studying the degradation mechanisms of electrolyte solutions used for Li-ion battery technology (Abellan et al., 2014b) . This approach provides the possibility of rapidly screening electrolytes candidates for an improved stability upon reduction. For all of this, we believe that as the interest on understanding the interaction of the electron beam with a higher number of liquid systems increases so too do the possibilities of application and the range of dynamic processes that can be explored. Techniques allowing real-time, high-resolution imaging of nanoscale processes by in situ TEM are currently under rapid development based on microchip systems that enable real-time imaging of controlled processes to be combined with, for instance, correlated electrical measurements (Huang et al., 2010; Kalles\u00f8e et al., 2012) . In addition to gas-phase ETEM studies, microchip-based systems also allow the imaging of processes in liquids (Williamson et al., 2003) and recently with good resolution (Li et al., 2012; Liao et al., 2012) . Here, we report on our recent advances in joule heated microcantilevers (Molhave et al., 2008) used for gas-phase in situ TEM studies of nanowire growth (Kalles\u00f8e et al., 2010) and devices, and on our efforts in creating a suspended microchannel system for TEM imaging of liquid samples and processes. We created and characterized nanowire devices by growing silicon nanowires in situ TEM using the VLS mechanism (Ross, 2010) , from one joule heated microcantilever to an adjacent cantilever, thereby forming a bridge. Building on our previous experiments, we studied the details of contact formation when a hot nanowire grows into contact with a similarly heated adjacent cantilever. A silicon-to-silicon junction forms as the catalytic gold diffuses away. The suspended microcantilevers system opens up novel ways to create electrically contacted nanowire devices (Kalles\u00f8e et al., 2012) in addition to allowing in situ TEM studies of the many simultaneous processes taking place upon contact formation and in situ electrical measurements carried out after connected nanowires were formed.",

To allow better control of the encapsulated volume and geometry, we are exploring devices using monolithic chips ( Figure 19 ) with suspended microfluidic channels made from silicon nitride (Jensen et al., 2014) . On the channels, thinned window regions allow higher resolution than in the supporting part of the channel. The system's novel geometry is expected to improve the imaging resolution by providing precise control over the channel height and the possibility of achieving small regions with ultrathin membranes for the best possible resolution. We have also developed an electrochemical setup suitable for use in SEM (Fig 2) ( Jensen, K\u00f8blera, Jensen, & M\u00f8lhave, 2013) . . Electron microscopy of specimens in liquid.

Nanoscale resolution is achievable for nanomaterials of a high atomic number (Z) in a low-Z liquid resulting from the Z contrast of STEM. It is also possible to study thin liquid samples using the environmental scanning electron microscope (ESEM) with STEM detector. Time-resolved Liquid STEM is feasible and can be used to study the movements of nanoparticles in liquid. We have found that the movement of nanoparticles in close proximity to the SiN membrane is up to three orders of magnitude slower than of Brownian motion in a bulk liquid . Liquid STEM is useful to explore growth processes of nanomaterials, such as gold dendrites (Kraus & de Jonge, 2013) .",

The performance of the traditional environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM), as well as novel membrane-based environmental cells for atmospheric pressure SEM, depends on electron mean free path in the ambient media and/or membrane itself, which usually is very small in solids, liquids, and dense gases. Novel 2D materials such as graphene and its derivatives have only a single atomic layer or a few thin layers and possess the unique combination of the mechanical strength (Lee et al., 2008) , molecular impermeability (Bunch et al., 2008) , optical and electron transparency (Stoll et al., 2012) in a wide electron energy range (see Figure 22 ). The latter makes these materials as prospective electron windows for ambient pressure SEM and electron spectroscopy, as well as for correlative imaging. In this report, we describe few tested designs of the graphene based environmental cells (GE-cell) along with protocols for their high yield fabrication (Krueger et al., 2011) . We compare these graphene windows with standard SIN membranes and demonstrate the capability to perform low-energy scanning electron microscopy (Stoll et al., 2012) , Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (Kolmakov et al., 2011) at atmospheric pressure using GE cells, which are hard to accomplish using standard approaches. The process of water radiolysis and bubble formation at the water-graphene interface was studied in vivo using SEM and XPS to demonstrate the capabilities of the technique (Figure 23 ; Kraus et al., 2014) . Sintering could be defined as the transformation of a powdered compact to a cohesive material under heating at high temperatures. It appears as a key-step in the preparation of ceramic materials such as nuclear fuels UOx and MOx (mixed oxide U and Pu). The sintering is usually described as having three different stages. The initial stage involves the elaboration of necks between the grains and leading to the cohesion of material, the intermediate and final stages are dedicated to the elimination of porosity between the grains by the means of grain growth mechanisms (Bernache-Assolant, 1993). The first stage of sintering is generally described through numerical simulation using simplified systems constituted by two or three spherical grains in contact (Wakai, 2006) . Presently, only few experimental works are devoted to the kinetics of necks elaboration (corresponding to the first stage of sintering) using ex situ TEM (Qin et al., 2010) and SEM (Slamovich & Lange, 1990) observations. These studies allowed experimental investigations of this stage of sintering on metallic materials with spherical grains.",

During the grain boundary motion, the preferential grain grows as measured by the distance d 0 between the actual boundary position and an obstacle at the interface versus time.

While atomic-resolution images and the combination of high spatial and energy resolution is ideally suited to distinguish between active and inactive catalyst particles and identify active surfaces for gas adsorption, unambiguous data can only be obtained from the area under observation. This lack of global information available from TEM measurements is generally compensated for by using other, ensemble measurement techniques such as X-ray or neutron diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, infrared spectroscopy, and Raman spectroscopy. However, it is almost impossible to create identical experimental conditions in two separate instruments to make measurements that can be directly compared. Moreover, ambiguities in ESTEM studies may arise from the unknown effects of the incident electron beam and uncertainty of the sample temperature. We have designed and built a unique platform that allows us to concurrently measure atomic-scale and micro-scale changes occurring in samples subjected to identical reactive environmental conditions by incorporating a Raman spectrometer on the ESTEM. We have used this correlative microscopy platform (1) to measure the temperature from a 60-\u03bcm 2 area using Raman shifts, (2) to investigate light-matter interactions, and (3) as a heating source for concurrent optical and electron spectroscopy, such as cathodoluminescence, electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS), and Raman. Details of the design, function, and capabilities will be illustrated with results obtained from in situ combinatorial measurements. ETEM is a unique tool combining imaging and spectroscopy capabilities with a spatial resolution approaching 1 \u00c5 at elevated temperatures and controlled gaseous environments. As with any other characterization technique, ETEM has drawbacks. Limitations in sample geometry and field of view call for use of complementary in situ characterization techniques. Such techniques could be in situ X-ray based techniques such as X-ray diffractometer (XRD), X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS). The combination of techniques will paint a more complete picture of the sample under a reactive environment.",

Converting solar energy into chemical bonds, and thereby increasing the storage capability of light energy harvesting, require the use of photocatalysts. In order to characterize and study such catalysts under relevant conditions, we have developed a TEM holder capable of exposing a sample to visible light inside the microscope. In this way, photo induced reactions and phenomena such as Cu 2 O degradation ( Figure 29 ) are studied in situ under different gaseous environments (Cavalca et al., 2013) .",

In liquid STEM, a microfluidic chamber assembled from two Si microchips with electron-transparent SiN windows is used to enclose the nanoparticle solution, and separate it from the vacuum in the microscope chamber ( Figure 30A ). The images were recorded at 200 keV in STEM mode using the annular-dark-field (ADF) detector providing Z-contrast. With this method, the particles show a high contrast compared to the background signal originating from the liquid layer. A spatial resolution of 1.5 nm was achieved for gold nanoparticles . In comparison to liquid STEM, there is no need of a microfluidic chamber in ESEM STEM ( Figure 31B ). The nanoparticles were imaged in a droplet of water on an SiN window that was cooled to 3\u00b0C. To maintain a stable liquid layer thickness, the water vapor pressure in the microscope chamber is adjusted to 750 Pa. To image the particles, we used 30 keV, resulting in a decreased but still nanoscale resolution compared to STEM at 200 keV.",

This solution has a higher viscosity compared to pure water and therefore slows the nanoparticle movement. Nanoparticles stabilized by a coating of positively charged thiolated chitosan (TCHIT) were used. The electron irradiation induced the detachment of the particles from the SiN membrane, and we observed a subsequent movement and agglomeration of the particles (Figure 31) . A bubble was formed during imaging by the interaction of the liquid with the electron beam. As a result, the liquid layer thickness in the bubble region was decreased, and we observed that the velocity of the nanoparticles depended on the thickness of the liquid layer. The thinner the liquid layer, the slower the particles move. The calculated theoretical displacement due to Brownian motion was more than two orders of magnitude higher than our experimental data. In the ESEM STEM experiments, we imaged 30-nm, citrate-stabilized nanoparticles in pure water. Two different regimes of velocities were observed, very fast ones and much slower ones. Interestingly, even the velocities of the fastest nanoparticles were much smaller than expected on the basis of Brownian motion. ",

            "text": "Nanomaterials have been promised a great future and are already being used in various applications. The recently updated definition of the term nanomaterial, to be used in all European Union (EU) legislation, is \"A nanomaterial means a natural, incidental, or manufactured material containing particles, in an unbound state or as an aggregate or as an agglomerate and where, for 50% or more of the particles in the number size distribution, one or more external dimensions is in the size range 1 nm-100 nm.\" In this definition, a nanoparticle has all three dimensions in the nanoscale. Because their physical and chemical properties depend very much on their size and shape, their characterization is of utmost importance. An in situ observation technique such as dynamic light scattering (DLS) is commonly used to probe the dispersion state of colloids dispersed in a fluid. This technique is very precise in determining mean particle size and its distribution for monomodal particle samples. But when multimodal distributions evolve (for example, induced by aggregation), the quantification becomes challenging due to the assumptions made in the applied models. Unfortunately, the median of the number-weighted size distribution, which has become an instrumental parameter in nanomaterial's legislation, cannot be retrieved by scattering methods. Transmission electron microscopic (TEM) analysis can provide model-free data and the number size distribution. However, in order to obtain TEM samples of nanoparticles in a fluid, the solvent (mostly water) must be removed. Drying effects will take place during sample preparation, which leads to the accumulation and aggregation and hence introduces bias or artifacts in the analysis (Michen et al., 2014) . It is impossible to differentiate nanoparticle aggregates caused by drying effects from aggregates that were formed prior to drying (e.g., due to colloidal instability of the system). Thus, TEM has long been thought to be unsuitable for quantitative investigations of nanoparticles and colloidal aggregates of nanoparticles in liquids. Here, we present a straightforward, cost-effective protocol that circumvents the drying issue ( Figure 32 ) by stabilizing the colloidal system using a macromolecular agent bovine serum albumin (BSA). TEM samples with various ratios of proteins to nanoparticles have been prepared and resulted in different spatial distributions of nanoparticles on the TEM grid. When a sufficient high-protein concentration was used, the resulting TEM images allow for automated data collection on a large number of nanoparticles which is in very good agreement with data obtained from dynamic light scattering and thus the actual dispersion state. With the introduction of commercially available transmission electron microscopy (TEM) holders for liquid specimens in recent years, the interest in liquid-cell TEM has greatly risen. Nowadays, this method is applied in scientific fields as different as battery research, cell biology, and materials science in order to gain information about structures and processes on the nanoscale in a liquid or the natural environment (de Jonge & Ross, 2011). However, the presence of liquids and, in most cases, also solutes dramatically increases the number of chemical reactions conceivable during an experiment in the electron microscope compared to TEM in a vacuum. In addition to interactions with solid materials, as known from conventional electron microscopy experiments, the electron beam influences the chemistry of the liquid. Electrons penetrating through the liquid excite electronic states in molecules or atoms or remove electrons from the electron shell, resulting in the generation of highly reactive, transient species (Henglein et al., 1969) . Some of these compounds are strong-reducing (e.g., solvated electrons) others are powerful oxidizing agents (e.g., hydroxyl radicals), that are capable of dissolving metals as noble as gold. These by-products are often not desired, as they may have severe consequences on the outcome of liquid cell transmission electron microscopy experiments, contingently leading to entirely unexpected results. Hence, a better understanding of these electron beam-induced processes, and avoiding them is needed in order to design experiments comparable to those without electron beam exposure.",

We utilized TEM experiments in scanning mode (e.g., STEM) in order to obtain a good handle on the dose introduced into the observed sample area. By varying the properties of the solution (e.g., the salt concentration or pH) and the imaging conditions, we altered the composition of the transient species generated by the electron beam . It became apparent that the addition of high concentrations of chloride ions, destabilized gold nanoparticles. Moreover, the size of the nanoparticles influenced the susceptibility toward dissolution, with smaller particles dissolving faster than bigger ones (Figure 33 ). Generally, in order to make the water and carbon energy cycles economically competitive in terms of today's fossil and nuclear energy, energy conversion materials have to be further optimized and therefore studied in more detail. More specifically, the fundamental details of platinum-based proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEM-FC) catalyst degradation are still not clear (Mayrhofer et al., 2008; Meier et al., 2012) . Missing insights can only be gained with an introduction of new advance characterization techniques like identical location transmission electron microscopy (IL-TEM) and in situ electrochemical TEM. A generally accepted technique, besides electrochemistry, used to study the structure of nanoparticles is a vacuum TEM equipped with numerous detectors enabling many characterization methods, such as electron diffraction, high-resolution TEM (HR-TEM), scanning TEM (STEM), and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), which provide a complete description of studied nanomaterial characteristics. This information is commonly used to interpret nanoparticle activity and stability. However, the concerns still remain whether the surface structure and morphology change of random spots is representative for the whole sample and if the structure and morphology integrity get disrupted when nanoparticles come in contact with the atmosphere or get immersed in the liquid electrolyte. It can reconstruct or deconstruct the metal surface depending on the interaction energy of thermodynamic driving forces. It can also change unevenly across the sample. In order to access the information of real surface structure at relevant conditions, identical locations and, more important, in situ observations are mandatory. Before IL-TEM was the only technique showing degradation on the same nanoparticle (Hodnik et al., 2014; Mayrhofer et al., 2008; Meier et al., 2012) . Combination of this approach with conventional electrochemistry provides a complete description of the catalytic activity and stability in relation to the surface structural characteristics.",

Plunge freezing is commonly used as a cryofixation technique for the stabilization of biological materials prior to electron microscopy (EM) (Dobro et al., 2010; Milne et al., 2013) . However, even if plunge freezing is the easiest way to retain the original structure of the sample, it is very difficult to achieve the high cooling rates (Ryan et al., 1992) necessary for obtaining amorphous ice and thus avoiding freezing artefacts such as ice crystal distortions. We present the development of a low-mass, microchip-based system for the measurement of ultra-fast freezing rates during cryo-immobilization of small hydrated volumes such as living cells and thin liquid films. Our system enables the change in temperature to be tracked accurately over the short timescales involved, by measuring the resistance of metallic thin-film resistors lithographically defined on the membrane. The chip system was used to determine cooling rates in slush nitrogen, propane and a mixture of propane and ethane with and without liquid samples. We measured cooling rates of over 100.000 K/s (see Figure 36 ) and heat transfer coefficients over 10.000 W/m 2 K on the dry chip, with lower values when liquid layers were present, and occasionally even higher values in slush nitrogen. Electroplating of copper is a widely used technique for aesthetic coatings, creating electrodes, and precoating prior to additional electroplating. Recently it has become possible to directly see the growth on a nanometer scale. Theory on the nucleation density laid down by Hyde and Compton (2003) was augmented by Radisic et al. (2006a Radisic et al. ( , 2006b after they found by means of in situ TEM that the nucleation density was three orders of magnitude more than predicted.

For morphological studies of parasites, as a part of taxonomy, SEM is commonly used. Sometimes only a small number or only one sample of a rare parasite is available and cannot be used in conventional SEM because the sample has to be fixed, dehydrated, and coated before it can be observed. SEM condemns samples to be destroyed so that further analysis is not possible (e.g., for molecular study or depositing as type material in a museum). Environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM) based on new methods (Ned\u011bla 2010; Ned\u011bla et al., 2015) and instrumentation (Jir\u00e1k et al., 2010) can be used for the advanced study of parasites in their native state. It was shown by Tihla\u0159\u00edkov\u00e1, Ned\u011bla, and Shiojiri (2013) in a study of surviving mites. Only a small number of parasites were investigated using ESEM, having benefits in the unnecessary preparation to conventional SEM, which considerably reduces their post-SEM value as described by Buffington, Burks, & McNeil (2005) in insects.",

A unique method for reaching and keeping thermodynamic conditions was used (Tihla\u0159\u00edkov\u00e1, Ned\u011bla, & Shiojiri, 2013) . The samples were cooled to 1\u00b0C and observed in a high-pressure water vapor environment of 690-670 Pa, probe current of 90 pA, and beam accelerating voltage of 20 kV. Samples were placed on a Peltier cooled silicone holder into a drop of water. Consequently, the water was slowly evaporated from the sample (see Figures 41 and 42 ). Using our ESEM, it is possible to keep and observe susceptible wet samples for a longer time in low-beam-current conditions.

A very slow and well controlled decrease in humidity allows the visualization of the surface topography of the sample to be free of distortions and changes in shape or dimension. Samples are well preserved from a taxonomical point of view as well. The optimal state of the sample is shown in Figure 42G . Highly visible morphology is shown in Figure 42H , but to the detriment of morphometrical data, as shown in Figure 42H . Both Figures 42G and h show a lateral view of the well-retained subventral lip equipped with one elliptical single papilla and amphid. Interlabia with undivided tip are also highly visible, as is the cuticular striation behind the lips. The suitability of ESEM for the study of parasites in a wet state and with minimal preparation was proved by our results. We introduce advanced ESEM methods continuing from the previous work by Lopes Torres et al. (2013) , Maia-Brigag\u00e3o and de Souza (2012), and Ma\u0161ov\u00e1 et al. (2010) . This method also will be applied with other types of parasites, and future research will be using ESEM with live samples of parasites. Structures with hollow interiors, such as hollow nanospheres, have recently received considerable scientific attention owing to their unique properties, which could facilitate breakthrough applications in various fields of nanoscience. Physical processing routes like pulsed-laser ablation (PLA) in the presence of a background gas have tremendous potential for applications because they offer flexibility in terms of the choice of materials to be ablated and, at the same time, the ability to produce well-defined, hollow nanospheres. It was shown previously that complex hollow nanospheres filled with nitrogen gas can be produced via a single-step procedure by the ablation of a metallic or alloy-based target into ambient nitrogen gas (\u0160turm et al., 2010, 2013) .",

Figure 44B shows the resulting N-K edge for Co-Pt and Fe-(SmTa) systems, which is presented together with the reference standard spectrum of N 2 gas obtained from air. The fine structure for all these N-K edges is distinctive for molecular nitrogen and is characterized by a sharply peaked edge at 401 eV, followed by a broad continuum. Following these results, the nanospheres observed in HAADF-STEM images ( Figure 44A ) were defined as hollow spheres filled with nitrogen gas.",

            "text": "To unambiguously determine if measured N signal corresponds to the presence of nitrogen gas trapped inside the hollow spheres, time-resolved EELS measurements combined with the HAADF-STEM imaging were performed. EEL spectra were acquired as a function of time until the perforation of the wall of the sphere, which was achieved by the intense electron probe ( Figure 45A ). The corresponding background subtracted N-K edges measured as a function of the exposure time are shown in Figure 45B . The N-K edge signal remains nearly constant in the first 20 s and drops abruptly to the background noise in the time frame of about 1 s, which clearly demonstrates the release of nitrogen gas from the interior of the sphere through the pinhole created by the intense electron probe. Quantitative analysis of the nitrogen density and pressure in Al, Fe-(SmTa), and Co-Pt systems was additionally performed. The number density of nitrogen atoms (n) in the voids of the nanospheres was determined by the following equation [2]: n \u00bc I N /(\u03c3 N I ZL d), where I N and I ZL are the intensities measured from the N-K ionization edge and the zero-loss peak, respectively; \u03c3 N is the angle-integrated hydrogenic cross section for the nitrogen K-shell ionization, calculated for the experimental collection angles; and d represents the measured diameter of the void. To calculate the pressure in the void accurately, with respect to the given density and the temperature range, a standard correction of an ideal gas law using a virial expansion was applied, as follows: P \u00bc nkT(1 + nB/N A + n 2 C/N A 2 + . . .), where k represents the Boltzmann constant; T is the absolute temperature,4; N A stands for the Avogadro constant; and B and C are the second and third virial coefficients, respectively. The calculated pressures ranged between 25 bars for the Co-Pt system up to 450 bars in Fe-(SmTa) and Al systems, respectively. The total error of the calculated pressures amounts to 17%. The obtained results support the idea that gasfilled hollow spheres could be fabricated in various complex metallic systems by applying PLA in the presence of a background gas, taking into consideration that in relation to the background gas high-solubility differences between the melt and corresponding solids are achieved. Blood platelets are anucleate cells that play a central role in the arrest of bleeding after a blood vessel is damaged. Platelets circulate at variable velocities in the bloodstream, and are activated following binding to subendothelial components [von Willebrand factor (vWF), collagen] that are exposed during vascular injury. Stable adhesion to collagen promotes the release of soluble components from platelet secretory granules, leading to the formation of a thrombus. Platelets also play a crucial role in the inflammatory response (Boilard et al., 2010; Semple et al., 2011) , through mechanisms that are less well characterized.",

Due to low contrast and low signal-to-noise ratio in images of frozen hydrated samples, it often appears difficult to localize structures of interest within heterogeneous samples. We have used iCorr-integrated correlative microscopy with high-resolution (cryo) electron tomography to study the secretory behavior of human platelet alpha granules. iCorr is designed to automate and accelerate CLEM experiments, resulting in fluorescent labeling information combined with 3D ultrastructural information.",

From dual-axis tomography analysis on flow-adherent cells, it appeared that subsets of vWF-containing granules migrate in a downstream fashion, while others remain stationary in the cell center. Downstreamoriented granules release vWF as strings in the direction of the flow ( Figures 46A,B) . Similar results were obtained when adherent platelets were vitrified in liquid ethane, followed by correlative analysis by the EM-integrated iCorr workflow (FEI Company) ( Figure 47 ). Low-dose tomographic analysis revealed subtle substructural modifications at the limiting alpha granule membrane that had not been observed before ( Figure 47D ). Whether these subtle membrane changes, which were visualized only after vitrification, give us a clue how platelets manage to differentially release their granule contents remains to be seen. ",

            "title": "Although FM allows identification of biomolecules, its resolution is limited by diffraction to about 200 nm, or 20-50 nm for super resolution techniques. Electron microscopy (EM) is capable of improving the resolution to sub-nanometer levels, which is required to study biomolecules and their structural environment. Combining both techniques in an integrated correlative light-and electron microscopy (iCLEM) system (Zonnevylle, 2013), makes fast biomolecule identification within the cell ultrastructure possible at high resolution and sensitivity (Liv, 2013), as shown in Figures 39A and B. However, correlating the live-cell FM image with images of fixed cells in EM is rather complex, and in some cases it may even be impossible. Electron microscopy of specimens in liquid has made great progress in development and applicability over the last decade. Samples under nearnative cell conditions are protected from a vacuum in the EM chamber by means of a liquid cell holder. This special holder contains SiN membranes or glass substrates that are transparent for electrons or photons, respectively. We recently managed to develop a holder that enables simultaneous widefield fluorescence (WF) and liquid scanning EM (SEM) on the same region of interest in an iCLEM system (Figures 40A and B). This allows EM investigation of regions of interest of cells under near-native conditions REFERENCES Liv",

In order to fully quantify these results, it will be necessary to further control the thickness of the ionic liquid.The microfabricated systems point to ways of making recordings of individual sample freezing with sub-millisecond time-resolution processes in liquids with subsequent electron microscopic imaging of the sample on the thin membranes.In conclusion, cryo-CLEM and cryo-tomography are powerful techniques that enable fast immobilization and capturing of membrane dynamics that occur during platelet activation, such as fusion pore formation and localized and timed release phenomena.",
