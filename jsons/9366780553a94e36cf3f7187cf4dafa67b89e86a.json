On Jan. 3, 2020, the SARS-CoV-2 was isolated in samples of broncho-alveolar lavage fluid from a patient in Wuhan and was confirmed as the cause of the novel CoV-infected pneumonia . On Jan. 20, 2020, Chinese experts confirmed human-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and infection of medical staff. Three days after that, the Chinese government locked down Wuhan in an unprecedented effort to curb the spread of SARS-CoV-2 (Xinhua Net, 2020). The SARS-CoV-2 infection has been reported not only in China, but also in other countries. As of Mar. 12, 2020, the number of confirmed cases of the novel CoV approached 128 000 with a total of 4713 reported deaths in at least 118 countries.",

These situations are giving rise to mental health problems, such as stress, anxiety, depressive symptoms, insomnia, and fear in patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, symptoms of the infection, such as fever, fatigue, and dyspnea, as well as the side effects of treatments, could result in worsening mental distress (Xiang et al., 2020) . Consistently, in the early stage of the SARS outbreak, the emergency of which had parallels with the COVID-19 epidemic, a range of psychiatric conditions, including high levels of stress, depressive symptoms, anxiety, insomnia, nightmares, and poor concentration, were reported by SARS patients (Chua et al., 2004) . Further evidence suggested that these psychiatric morbidities might be still significant even when persons infected with SARS recovered physically (Tsang et al., 2004) , and SARS survivors who had a history of psychiatric consultation in the acute phase of the illness had a higher risk for psychological distress later, after discharge from the hospital, and might warrant timely and focused mental health support services (Wu et al., 2005) .",

The psychological impacts of SARS-CoV-2 should not be overlooked. However, evidence-based interventions targeted at COVID-19 patients are scarce. Thus, the aims of the present study are to introduce an internet-based integrated intervention to COVID-19 patients with psychological distress and to evaluate the efficacy of the provided mental health care on depression and anxiety symptoms in patients with COVID-19. This is a prospective, randomized, controlled, 2-week study conducted in the First Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University (Hangzhou, China) from Feb. 2 to Feb. 28, 2020. All the laboratoryconfirmed COVID-19 patients in the isolation ward were screened by Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) (Kroenke et al., 2001) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) (Spitzer et al., 2006) for psychological distress and finally, a total of 26 COVID-19 patients were enrolled in this study. The inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) aged 18-65 years; (2) PHQ-9 or GAD-7 of \u22655; (3) completed at least a junior middle school level of education. Any participant who met one of the following criteria was excluded: (1) PHQ-9 or GAD-7 of \u226515; (2) with suicidal ideation; (3) use of any antipsychotics; (4) the underlying disease was too severe to complete the assessments; (5) unable to follow the instructions of the internet-based intervention. A list of random sequence assignments for each group was drawn up by computer at the beginning of the study. After recruitment, 26 participants were randomly assigned to groups sequentially, with an equal probability of receiving an internet-based integrated intervention (intervention group) or just supportive care (control group), with 13 participants in each group. The 17-item Hamilton Depression Scale (17-HAMD) (Hamilton, 1967) and Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA) (Hamilton, 1959) were used to assess the severity of depression and anxiety symptoms, respectively, and the efficacy of the internet-based integrated intervention every week. The outcomes of psychological assessments were analyzed by repeated measures analyses of variance with time as the within-subjects factor and group as the between-subjects factor. Last observation carried forward (LOCF) analysis was performed only in patients who dropped out and failed to complete two-week intervention.",

It has been demonstrated in a previous meta-analysis that internet-delivered cognitive behavior therapy (ICBT) was as effective as face-to-face treatment for depressive symptoms, social anxiety disorder, and other psychological or somatic disorders (Andersson et al., 2014) . In this context, internet-based interventions increasingly complement face-to-face counseling or therapy. Furthermore, Data were expressed as number, number (percentage), or mean\u00b1standard deviation (SD). CHD: coronary heart disease; AIDS: acquired immune deficiency syndrome; PHQ-9: Patient Health Questionnaire-9; GAD-7: Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 internet-based interventions also showed advantages over face-to-face therapy, and the benefits mainly included low threshold accessibility, flexible use, independence of time and place, use at a selfdetermined pace, a high level of autonomy and privacy, and lower costs (Schr\u00f6der et al., 2016) . These factors might be especially relevant for COVID-19 patients since the human-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2 was confirmed and the infected patients were in quarantine. Internet-based intervention could also diminish the risk of infection in mental healthcare providers.",

The types of interventions that predominated as efficacious included information and education with or without professional psychological support, and, to a lesser extent, combined with peer and psychological support (Sherifali et al., 2018) . Nevertheless, in an internetbased intervention comprising five structured confrontational writing assignments, for individuals who experienced the death of a first-degree relative and who were significantly distressed, although writing decreased feelings of emotional loneliness and increased positive mood, writing did not affect grief or depressive symptoms. One possible explanation for the unexpected outcome might be related to the fact that the participants who entered the study were on average quite distressed (van der Houwen et al., 2010) . In our study, only patients with mild to moderate depression or anxiety symptoms were recruited, and the results were in accord with our initial expectation. Taken together, the current findings provided information that individuals with mild to moderate psychological distress might be more suitable for internetbased intervention.",
