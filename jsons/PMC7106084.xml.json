High mutation rates together with asexual reproduction often results in these viruses behaving as quasispecies. In the traditional definition of a species, an organism evolves to become most fit for its ecologic niche. For small RNA viruses, it is more appropriate to examine clusters of related viruses, called quasispecies. If a single fittest sequence is not part of an overall group of related fit sequences, it can be at an evolutionary disadvantage (de la Torre and Holland, 1990). Small RNA viruses need to be able to change rapidly, and an individually fit virus that is unable to shift to other related fit viruses will be outcompeted. Therefore, a quasispecies does not evolve toward a single fittest genome sequence, and it is essential to understand population structure and mutation spectra of these viruses.",

            "text": "Caliciviruses are small positive stranded RNA viruses. There is evidence that feline calicivirus behaves as a quasispecies (Radford et al., 1998), and it is probable that all caliciviruses do so. San Miguel Sea Lion Virus (SMSV), a calicivirus in the genus Vesivirus, is one of the most commonly reported viruses of marine mammals (Van Bonn et al., 2000). It causes vesicular lesions in the mouth and on flippers of pinnipeds (Schaffer and Soergel, 1973, Smith et al., 1983b) and has been suggested as a cause of epizootic gastroenteritis of California sea lions (Zalophus californianus) (Schmitt et al., 2009). It is genetically indistinguishable from Vesicular Exanthema of Swine Virus (VESV), which is considered a reportable foreign animal disease (Neill et al., 1995). SMSV has a larger host range than other known vertebrate viruses, and has been found to infect numerous species including fish (Smith et al., 1980), amphibians, reptiles (Barlough et al., 1998), and primates (Smith et al., 1983a). There is evidence associating SMSV with vesicular lesions in humans (Smith et al., 1998a) as well as hepatitis (Smith et al., 2006). It is probable that SMSV is of marine origin, and fish hosts may play a significant role in propagation of disease (Smith et al., 1998b). Vesiviruses have demonstrated the ability to rapidly become more virulent. Feline calicivirus, which recently diverged from SMSV/VESV, remains stable in the marine environment (Kadoi and Kadoi, 2001) and capable of infecting California sea lions (Smith et al., 1998b). Strains of feline calicivirus have emerged that result in systemic hemorrhagic disease with 33\u201350% mortality (Pedersen et al., 2000). Feline calicivirus strains associated with hemorrhagic disease have arisen independently more than once (Coyne et al., 2006, Schorr-Evans et al., 2003).",

            "text": "Until fairly recently, all large-scale genome sequencing was done using the Sanger method, which produces several hundred bases of sequence per reaction. Recent technological advances in DNA sequencing dramatically improve the cost-efficiency of sequence production. The first of these technologies commercialized is pyrosequencing (Nordstrom et al., 2000), which produces up to a million sequences from a single reaction and requires less nucleic acid manipulation prior to sequencing, thus decreasing bias. When dealing with a small genome such as that found in caliciviruses, this enables a snapshot of an entire population, enabling the study of quasispecies. Pyrosequencing technology has been used to characterize variation in human immunodeficiency virus (Wang et al., 2007), hepatitis B (Lindstr\u00f6m et al., 2004) influenza (Lackenby et al., 2008), and hepatitis C (Lahser et al., 2003) viruses. Use of next generation sequencing technologies may reduce sequencing costs of large data sets by more than two orders of magnitude, and costs are expected to decrease further as technologies advance (Li et al., 2009, Shendure and Ji, 2008).",

DNA capture beads containing amplified DNA were deposited in individual regions of a 4-region 25 mm \u00d7 75 mm PicoTiter plate, and DNA sequences determined with the GS-FLX instrument using the A primer. Individual DNA sequences were mapped to the SMSV reference sequences using Newbler (454 Life Sciences). The capsid precursor sequences were also manually double-checked using MUSCLE (Edgar, 2004), and multiple sets of 499 sequences from each helicase data set were manually checked for consistency with Newbler results. To reduce errors, we discarded homopolymer-associated indels with a prevalence of less than 3% from mutational analysis, and any mutation without a prevalence of 1% or greater in at least one sample. We also discarded sequences containing large deletions from mutational analysis. Indels resulting in a frameshift were not counted, as even if these sequences are non-erroneous they are not likely to produce functional virus.",

The diversity we report in San Miguel Sea Lion Virus (SMSV) and the population changes seen after short passage in culture show that SMSV behaves as a quasispecies. In culture, the minority sequence in the capsid precursor at position 5826 rapidly shifted after five passages to become the majority sequence. This mutation is in the carboxy-terminal A region of the capsid precursor, which, is cleaved off of the precursor by the viral protease when the mature capsid is formed (Sosnovtsev et al., 1998). In vesiviruses that have been examined, the A region is more conserved than the E region, but less than the B region (Glenn et al., 1999). Most antigenic epitopes are found in the E region, which is the most variable part of the genome and has been the most extensively examined in vesiviruses (Kreutz et al., 1998, Matsuura et al., 2001, Radford et al., 1998). We note that capsid precursor sites with amino acid coding differences between the 2004 and 2006 clinical samples (found from nucleotides 5793 to 5817) were close to 5826. Further work is needed to understand the biological significance of this region.",

Information on quasispecies structure is important to trace outbreaks. For many pathogens, serotyping has been found to correspond unreliably with relatedness (Matiz et al., 1998, Amonsin et al., 2002). Serotyping looks at immunogenic areas of the genome, which are under positive evolutionary selection. This is the sole criteria distinguishing VESV, a reportable foreign animal disease in the US, from SMSV. Given the ability of caliciviruses to change rapidly, serotyping is likely to be fraught with problems for understanding marine caliciviruses or any quasispecies population structure, and it is probable that there are multiple undescribed serotypes. The antigenic regions of feline calicivirus in persistently infected cats have been shown to be hypervariable (Kreutz et al., 1998, Radford et al., 2003). There are at least 16 different serotypes of marine mammal caliciviruses. Although limited initial work has been done, the genetic relationship between serotypes is incompletely understood (Berke et al., 1997, Neill et al., 1995, Reid et al., 1999). Work examining diversity of vesiviruses outside of the hypervariable regions of the capsid has been limited to small numbers of sequences (Neill, 1992, Glenn et al., 1999, Foley et al., 2006).",

This region is thought to be a helicase due to homology to the 2c protein of picornaviruses, although experimental evidence is lacking for this conclusion (Glenn et al., 1999). It is one of the most conserved regions in the vesiviruses (Glenn et al., 1999), implying a key biological role. Consistent with previous findings of conservation of this region, we report fewer differences between the 2004 clinical sample and the 2004 passaged culture than were found in the capsid. However, there were a greater number of potential coding differences seen in the putative helicase region than in the capsid precursor between the 2004 and 2006 clinical samples. One plausible explanation for this observation could be that the evolutionary relationships between our 2004 and 2006 samples differed in the helicase and capsid precursor protein regions. Recombination is not uncommon in those positive stranded RNA viruses that have been studied (Simmonds, 2006), and it is probable that this is also the case with SMSV.

SMSV/VES is a virus with an unusually large host range in a genus with a demonstrated ability to become highly virulent and lethal pathogens. Emerging disease is frequently associated with host switches. One recent meta-analysis of human diseases found that 816 of 1407 (58%) are zoonotic, and of human diseases, zoonotic diseases are significantly more likely to be emerging (Woolhouse and Gowtage-Sequeria, 2005). Most recent emerging diseases have been associated with host switches, including SARS coronavirus, H5N1 avian influenza, Hendra virus, Nipah virus, and AIDS. Further, viral diseases are much more likely to be emerging, especially RNA viruses (Woolhouse and Gowtage-Sequeria, 2005). Given the evidence of human infection with SMSV, further studies of the ecology and effects of host switching on the evolution of this virus are indicated (Smith et al., 1998a, Smith et al., 1998b, Smith et al., 2006).",

The reagents used in this study for reverse transcription and PCR amplification (Qiagen OneStep RT-PCR Kit) have been used previously in conjunction with pyrosequencing to look for mutations in influenza neuraminidase genes (Lackenby et al., 2008). With the Qiagen reagents used, reverse transcriptase error rates are expected to be approximately 1 in 10,000, and DNA polymerase error rates are 2\u20133 per 100,000 (Qiagen). Error rates with an earlier model of pyrosequencer (GS20) have been found to be approximately 0.5% (Huse et al., 2007). The majority of pyrosequencing errors are associated with errors in reading lengths of homopolymers (Huse et al., 2007). Use of high fidelity DNA polymerases is expected to reduce PCR errors and reduce error rates; however, the higher error rate of reverse transcription, which precedes PCR amplification, is a greater concern. One method to improve true mutation detection in future studies would be to run duplicate or triplicate samples. Replicates could be distinguished from each other by inserting short sequence \u201cbarcodes\u201d in the PCR primers between the pyrosequencing linkers and the calicivirus-specific sequence (Hoffmann et al., 2007). Mutations only prevalent in one replicate would be likely due to reverse transcription/PCR errors.",

Two possible explanations include quantitation errors prior to pyrosequencing and pyrosequencing bias against the capsid precursor PCR product, which was longer than the desired length for a standard emulsion PCR template. The authors feel that the second explanation is more probable. Significant bias against DNA fragments over 400 bp in pyrosequencing has been previously demonstrated and attributed to suboptimal emulsion PCR of longer fragments (Torres et al., 2008). If significant bias against longer capsid precursor products was present, then bias toward large deletions present may result in overrepresentation, and the proportion of large deletions in the actual samples may not be as great. However, this would not affect the presence of differences between the samples.",

We have shown that population changes can occur in this evolutionary distance, and assessment of original patient samples is preferable for understanding SMSV populations.
