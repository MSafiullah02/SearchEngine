As the size of the particles gets reduced to nanoscale range, there is an immense increase in the surface to volume ratio which increases reactivity and changes the mechanical, electrical, and optical properties of the particles.",

Nanotechnology is gaining momentum and becoming a worldwide important tool for the food and bioprocessing industry in meeting the foreseeable increasing world demand that will result from population growth and increasing incomes in developing countries.

The advantage of this sensor system is that thousands of nanoparticles can be placed on a single sensor to accurately detect the presence of insects or fungus inside stored grain bulk in bins.

Being a very new technology, lack of data introduces potentially high uncertainty into assessments of environmental risk. The key areas of uncertainty must first be identified, and the strategic approach for addressing and managing these areas of uncertainty needs to be developed. A study from the USA (Monteiller et al. 2007) shows that toxicities of nanoparticles and large particles were similar when the dose was expressed in surface area. Hence, the complexity of the nanomaterials behavior in natural systems and the uncertainty introduced for hazard and exposure assessment can be answered by building on experiences with chemicals risk assessment. Toxicological assessment of nanomaterials in food applications by high content screening technique and Zebrafish model can provide valuable developmental toxicity information in terms of endpoint identification and mechanism elucidation (Donofrio 2006). Further research into human exposure to nanomaterials and their toxicology and biokinetics is needed.",
