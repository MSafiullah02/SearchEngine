Reads passing quality filters were cleaned from non-viral reads by aligning with BWA MEM [6] against, in this order, human, bacterial, bovine and canine genomes. Reads not matching any of the above genomes were aligned with BLAST [7] against an in-house viral database that contains approximately 68'000 different virus sequences. For each sequencing read that passed the quality filter, the BLAST hit with lowest e-value was reported, given the coverage and identity were higher than 75%. Reads which did not match 3 genomes used in the cleaning step and did not match viral genomes included in the database were reported as of unknown origin.",
