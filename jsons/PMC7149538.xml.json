Diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), avian influenza, or bioterrorism caused by the deliberate release of biological agents, all represent new challenges for outbreak alert and response worldwide. Only early detection of disease activity, followed by a rapid response, can reduce the impact of epidemics and prevent harm caused by disease outbreaks [1]. The World Health Organisation defines a disease outbreak as the \u201coccurrence of cases of disease in excess of what would normally be expected in a defined community, geographical area or season.\u201d An outbreak may occur in a restricted geographical area or may extend over several countries. It may last for a few days or weeks, or for several years [2]. A single case of a communicable disease long absent from a population, or caused by an agent (e.g., bacterium or virus) not previously recognized in that community or area, as well as the emergence of a previously unknown disease, may also constitute an outbreak and should be reported and investigated immediately after its occurrence.\n",

Traditional surveillance systems that rely on reported diagnoses from laboratories, doctors, or hospitals are well established in all EU countries. While traditional systems can recognize trends over a long time period, and ensure a public health response to identified risks, new emerging threats such as SARS, human cases of avian influenza, might remained unrecognized. Furthermore, despite the development of new approaches for the detection of previously unknown threats (e.g., monitoring of syndromes, death rates, drug prescriptions), these are still insufficient, because signals leading to a public health alert can originate from other sources.",

Awareness of diseases achieved through first-hand observations and \u201cword of mouth\u201d can influence people\u2019s behavior and reduce the risk of an outbreak and the number of infected people [3]. Therefore, gathering information from the Web now represents one important part of Epidemic Intelligence\n[1]. Epidemic intelligence combines all efforts for systematic health event detection by providing a conceptual framework into which countries may complete their public health surveillance system. The objective of Epidemic Intelligence is to complement traditional surveillance systems by going beyond traditional public health surveillance and incorporating new official and unofficial sources of structured and unstructured information [1].",

Consider the following example: many people suffer from flu every year and many of them search for relevant information in the internet, and share their health problems with others online. In this way, a description of their symptoms, time-stamped and even geo-tagged, is available through search logs, social networks, or other social media tools. Therefore, the internet provides a rather detailed picture of the health of the population, coming from digital sources, through all of our connected devices, including smartphones.",

Crisis communication is an ongoing process associated with the exchanging information of opinions on a crisis and the coordination of resources including equipment, personnel, and information to avoid or reduce harm and for coordinating resources during a crisis [5], [6]. It also includes the strategy to make people\u2019s behavior more rational that they could make informed decisions. The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) is claiming in a report that \u201cSocial media are revolutionizing communication\u201d [5]. They report three ways to use social media in crisis management: (1) as situation awareness tool, (2) as state communication tool, or (3) as a platform for dynamic interaction. Natural disasters such as the 2010 Haiti earthquake or flood in Thailand revealed already the utility of internet-based social media for risk and crisis communication [7]. In these contexts, social media represented an opportunity to broaden warnings to large population groups. OECD acknowledges a \u201cgreat potential to support two-way crisis communication at low cost and with high efficacy\u201d [5].",

For example, PatientsLikeMe (https://www.patientslikeme.com/, last accessed 17.11.2015) is a social network for patients that allows them to share health-related experiences and compare treatments. The community currently comprises more than 350,000 patient members (November, 2015). Over 2500 conditions are reported in the platform. Data is collected in a rather structured manner: for the various features such as quality of life or single symptoms, categories are predefined (e.g., quality of physical life on a scale of 4 between best and worst, see Fig. 4.1\n). Access to health social networks is often restricted to members, i.e., only registered members can connect to others and read through their content. For applications in digital epidemiology, posted messages would need to be collected and analyzed automatically. Given the restricted access, this is difficult if not impossible, also due to legal issues (see Section 4.6). However, social networks offer the opportunity to be used in crisis communication, either for coordinating emergency services and volunteers, or to share information inside a community.\n",

Similar to a paper-based diary, the authors describe their personal opinions, impressions, and feelings. Online reviews of medical products are an additional source of information regarding the efficacy and adverse effects of drugs and medical devices. A microblog is a blogging platform where the amount of information that can be shared per author is very short. The most common examples of microblogs are Twitter and Tumblr. Twitter\u2019s limit is set such that a standard text message, which is limited at 160 characters, can include one entire tweet plus address information. Besides individuals, organizations are tweeting. For example, the U.S. Center of Disease Prevention and Control (https://twitter.com/cdcflu) and the organization Med\u00e9cins sans Frontiers (https://twitter.com/MSF) are tweeting updates on disease activity (Table 4.1\n). Systems that collect information on disease activity have channels where detected activities are posted [e.g., HealthMap (https://twitter.com/healthmap), ProMED-mail (https://twitter.com/ProMED_mail)]. Furthermore, vaccination or disease prevention campaigns are supported by information distribution through twitter or other blogging platforms. Twitter has been proven a frequently updated data source and many technologies analyze twitter messages for the purpose of detecting public health threats [5].",

These were (1) content collection, (2) signal generation, (3) user modeling and recommendation, as well as (4) visualization in a user interface. The services worked in a pipeline fashion and were triggered automatically four times a day.\nContent collection and document analysis component\nThe information database of the system was filled continuously by the content collector and document analysis component. It collected data from various sources by means of web crawling and streaming APIs (e.g., the Twitter API), and made them accessible to other components. The collection focused on broadcast news from TV and radio, news data from MedISys [16], and social media content from blogs, forums, and Twitter. The TV and radio data was collected via satellite and transcribed to written text by SAILs Media Mining Indexing System [23]. About 1300 names of symptoms and diseases were used as keywords for collecting data extended by existing language resources such as WordNet, GermaNet, or the OpenOffice thesaurus. The data was tokenized and part-of-speech tagged by the Tree Tagger and parsed by the Stanford Parser. All texts were also semantically annotated with geo tags, disease or symptom tag and temporal expressions as well as with information on the affected organism. In the following, the term \u201ctext\u201d is used to refer to some piece of text which can be, e.g., a tweet, a blog posting, or even a transcript of a TV or radio transmission.\nSignal generation component\nThe event detection and signal generation component exploited the annotated texts provided by the content collection and document analysis component to generate signals. A signal was a hint to some anomalous event. The component produced signals with associated information on the disease or symptom the signal is referring to and a location that has been extracted for that signal. In a first step, sentences were classified as relevant or irrelevant by the method presented before. For all relevant sentences, entity pairs (location, disease) were exploited to produce time series for each entity pair occurring in sentences of texts published within 1 week.The time series provided the input for statistical methods for signal generation, CUSUM and Farrington. These two statistical methods had originally been developed for indicator-based surveillance [24]. Cumulative sum or CUSUM methods focused on several consecutive periods and sum up the aberrations in one particular direction. The Farrington approach fitted a regression model to the data over several years, allowing for a secular trend. Outbreaks in the past were automatically identified and removed, and the statistical distribution fitted either to rare counts or to frequent counts.The user interface allowed to select the algorithm used to calculate signals. Between 0 and 50 signals were generated by this procedure every night. The exact number depended on several variables or factors that influence the generation of signals such as the type of considered data (e.g., Twitter\u2018s update frequency was much higher than of a blog).\nRecommendation component\nThe recommendation component got as input the generated signals and either selected those that were of interest for a user according to his profile or ranked the signals appropriately. The component also supported users with personalized presentation options (e.g., tag clouds, list of recommendations) that were visualized in the user interface. In this way, information or alerts were filtered before being presented to a user, which in turn reduced information overload. The recommendation component required a user profile that consisted of information on user behavior from interactions with the system (e.g., ratings, tags, search terms).The personalization and recommendation of signals mainly relied upon the tagging behavior of a user. Tags were potential indicators of user preference. For recommending items to the user, tags assigned by him to his texts of interest were compared against the tags assigned to candidate and unknown texts. In order to help users navigating through a vast collection of texts and finding new items, a tag cloud component provided a visual representation of texts. Besides indexing texts in the corpus, each tag helped users to find new related information of interest.\nUser interface and visualization\nThe user interface allowed a user to search for disease names or symptoms and to assess the related signal information by means of a geographic map, a tag cloud, or a timeline. The geographic map plotted the signals to a map. It enabled users to select specifically signals related to locations that are of interest to them. The timeline showed the text volume referring to a specific disease or symptom (or the corresponding signal, respectively) over time. This allowed users to learn about the progress of a disease outbreak as reflected in social media and also about seasonal differences. The tag clouds provided a quick overview on the content of the texts associated with a signal. They enabled the user to quickly decide about the relevance of a signal. Access to the original sources that contributed to the signal generation was provided, as well as filtering capabilities (e.g., selecting a time span). Furthermore, user feedback options were included into the user interface. With \u201cThumbs up\u2013thumbs down\u201d and a rating scale for signals, users could judge the relevancy of the presented signal. This information was fed back to the recommendation process and considered for ranking and filtering.\n",

But, M-Eco brought such reports quickly to a broader attention. It was not possible to present an example where M-Eco was the first to detect an outbreak by a clustering of social media contributions with similar symptoms in space and time, and where the outbreak was afterwards confirmed by the traditional notification system. Another lesson learnt is not to underestimate the legal and ethical issues related to IT solutions for digital epidemiology. We discuss relevant issues in Section 4.6.",

A challenge is the high risk of manipulation, in particular the risk of analyzing postings containing wrong or misleading information. The usefulness of social media for disease surveillance depends clearly on the willingness of people to share (correct) information online and to use online tools.

Imagine a health status monitoring tool that identifies a group of sick persons by analyzing social media conversation. In which manner should a health organization react that becomes aware of this conversation? The current interaction or reaction processes are often not foreseeing a reaction of the national health organizations, but on a local level. This means, processes need to be adapted when considering social media as source of information or for crisis communication. These and similar questions need to be answered before such applications go online. When using social media or online traces for surveillance purposes, the right for individual self-determination\u2014what happens with my data\u2014is weighted in crisis situations against the wellbeing of the society.
