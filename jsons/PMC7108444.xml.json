            "text": "The host defenses against invading pathogens are dependent on a rapid and effective early response by the infected organism. One of the first responses against viral infections is the production of anti-viral cytokines, including interferons (IFNs), and tumor necrosis factor (TNF). Once produced, cytokines act directly on both infected and uninfected cells, activate cellular constituents of the innate immune system, and promote T and B cell responses. The effects of these cytokines are pleiotropic and influenced by dose as well as the presence or absence of other cytokines. The antiviral state induced by these cytokines alone has been extensively studied but certain cytokine combinations have been shown to be synergistic and distinct from that induced by any cytokine alone, and is not just simply additive. This review summarizes the findings on the novel synergistic antiviral state induced by the combination of type-I and type-II interferons or either of these interferons types plus TNF. To our knowledge this is the first time this subject has been reviewed.",

            "text": "Over the past 60 years, a variety of IFN proteins have been discovered and grouped into types-I, -II and -III. Although IFNs alone are effective inhibitors of some viruses, such as vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) or encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV), many other viruses have evolved sophisticated mechanisms to subvert the host IFN responses [1, 2, 3]. For example, human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) and many poxviruses inhibit both types-I and -II IFN-stimulated antiviral and immunoregulatory responses at multiple steps. Several studies, however, have shown that viruses normally resistant to the effects of type-I or type-II IFNs separately, are susceptible to these IFNs when used in combination. For example, IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 and IFN-\u03b3 synergistically inhibit the replication of herpes simplex virus type-1 (HSV-1) both in vitro and in vivo [4]. Likewise, IFN-\u03b3 synergizes with IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 to inhibit the in vitro replication of other members of the herpes virus family, such as HCMV [5], varicella-zoster virus (VZV) [6], HSV-2 [7] and pseudorabies virus (PRV) [8], as well as decrease the transformation of human umbilical cord lymphocytes by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) [9]. As for other virus families, earlier reports indicated that combination of IFN-\u03b3 and IFN- \u03b1/\u03b2 was able to block the replication of several viruses including mengo virus, VSV, vaccinia virus (VV) [10], sindbis virus [11], severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [12, 13, 14, 15], hepatitis C virus (HCV) [16], mouse hepatitis virus type-2 (MHV-2) [17], lassa virus [18] and foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) [19].",

Instead, it was inferred that the combination of IFN-\u03b2 and IFN-\u03b3 in these cells suppressed HSV-1 replication non-cytolytically via preventing detectable viral immediate early (IE) and early (E) protein synthesis in two-thirds of HSV-1-infected cells while blocking viral DNA synthesis in the remaining one-third of HSV-1-infected cells [24\u2022]. Similar findings were observed for HCMV and PRV [5, 8]. The mechanism of how this viral inhibition takes place, however, is not totally clear.",

            "text": "The abilities of IFNs to protect against various viral infections are derived from the complex transcriptional programs they initiate [22, 25, 26]. The combination of IFN-\u03b3 and IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 induces an antiviral state more rapidly than the addition of either cytokine alone, and is the result of a more rapid onset of cellular transcription [27]. A recent report by Peng et al. [28\u2022\u2022] defined two types of synergy. The first synergy was defined as \u2018synergy by independent action,\u2019 in which IFN-\u03b2 and IFN-\u03b3 induce distinct categories of genes that work in a synergistic manner to inhibit viral replication. For example, IFN-\u03b2 induces antiviral proteins such as RIG-I, MDA-5 and oligoadenylate synthetase 1 (OAS1), while IFN-\u03b3 induces antiviral proteins such as indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (INDO) [28\u2022\u2022]. Although these proteins are not synergistically induced, their functions, however, synergistically inhibit viral replication. The second, \u2018synergy by cooperative action,\u2019 described the positive interaction between IFN-\u03b2 and IFN-\u03b3, leading to a much higher level of gene expression relative to that when either is used alone. For example, ISG20 is induced to high levels following addition of IFN-\u03b2 plus IFN-\u03b3 but is not induced in the presence of either cytokine alone [28\u2022\u2022]. These two forms of synergy can function simultaneously. For example, the combination of IFN-\u03b2 and IFN-\u03b3 synergistically induces TNFSF10 while down-regulating its decoy receptor TNFRSF10D through \u2018synergy by cooperative action\u2019. Simultaneously, the coordinated upregulation of TNFSF10 and downregulation of its inhibitor TNFRSF10D leads to an increase in apoptosis through \u2018synergy by independent action\u2019 [28\u2022\u2022].",

This apparent contrast may perhaps be owing to the differences in the cell type and/or the MOI used. In one case the combined IFNs were added following infection of Vero cells with HSV-1 at an MOI of 2.5 [24\u2022] while in case of the primary human fibroblasts, cells were pretreated with combined IFNs for 48 h before infection with HSV-1 at an MOI of 5, or higher [28\u2022\u2022]. Notably, Peng et al. indicated that no significant difference in apoptosis between combined and individual treatments was found when they infected primary human fibroblasts with HSV-1 at an MOI of 1. Clearly, elucidation of more biological roles of the IFN-stimulated genes is crucial in order to be able to better understand how types-I and -II IFNs utilize their synergy to combat viral replication.",

In 1988, Mestan et al. reported a significant enhancement of the antiviral state in HEp-2 cells against VSV by combining TNF with low concentrations of either IFN-\u03b2 or IFN-\u03b3 [29\u2022\u2022]. Likewise, the antiviral activity of TNF in human FS-4 foreskin fibroblasts, against EMCV, also synergized with sub-effective concentrations of autocrine IFN-\u03b2 [30]. Additionally, results from this lab demonstrate a potent antiviral synergistic interaction between TNF and IFN-\u03b2 against myxoma virus in both primary human monocytes and fibroblasts (submitted for publication).",

However, such a model would not explain the synergism in antiviral activity observed after treatment of cells with TNF and exogenous IFN-\u03b2 but would rather predict an additive effect. In fact, a recent report demonstrated that the synergistic activation of inflammatory genes such as Cxcl9, Cxcl10, Cxcl11 and Ccl5 was observed following addition of TNF and low concentrations of IFN-\u03b2 (1 U/ml) at early time points before the production of endogenous IFN-\u03b2 [37\u2022]. This sustained expression of inflammatory-related genes leads to subsequent expression of classic interferon-response genes, including those known to mediate antiviral responses [37\u2022]. Similarly, the combination of TNF and IFN-\u03b2 synergistically augments expression of genes already induced by TNF and/or IFN-\u03b2 and induces a novel set of genes in primary human cells not induced by either cytokine alone (our unpublished data). Undoubtedly, further studies are needed to determine the functional relevance of these induced genes for the overall antiviral state in order to reveal more aspects of the mechanistic details underlying the synergistic interaction between TNF and IFN-\u03b2.",

Pretreatment with IFN-\u03b3, however, only results in a 30\u201350% increase in TNFR expression and no increase in affinity of these receptors for TNF, leading to the conclusion that this increase might be insufficient to cause the multi-log reduction in viral titer observed in many systems [29\u2022\u2022]. Additionally, treatment of some cells with IFN-\u03b3 results in an increase in TNFR expression without a corresponding increase in TNF function [48].

Interestingly, the combination of IFN-\u03b2 and TNF results in a synergistic upregulation of INDO while neither cytokine alone is able to (our unpublished observations). Thus, the combination of TNF and IFN-\u03b2 might induce an antiviral state which mimics that induced by IFN-\u03b3 alone.",

As mentioned earlier, several groups have shown that treatment of some cells with TNF results in secretion of IFN-\u03b2. The depletion of this IFN-\u03b2 has been shown to result in a loss of synergy between TNF and IFN-\u03b3 [32, 35]. These data suggest that the synergistic antiviral state observed following treatment with TNF and IFN-\u03b3 might be the result of synergy between IFN-\u03b3 and IFN-\u03b2. IFN-\u03b2, however, is not always secreted following treatment with TNF (our unpublished observations), and IFN-\u03b2 has previously also been shown to synergize directly with TNF [29\u2022\u2022, 30]. Thus, while IFN-\u03b2 might occasionally play a role in synergy between TNF and IFN-\u03b3, it is not likely to be the only mediator.",

By contrast, other groups have shown that following treatment with TNF and IFN-\u03b3 early gene expression, DNA synthesis, and protein expression of MCMV, adenovirus, and PRV remain unaltered [45, 46, 58]. In the cases of MCMV and adenovirus, treatment with TNF and IFN-\u03b3 inhibits processing of viral proteins which are critical for virion maturation [45, 46], while treatment of cells with TNF and IFN-\u03b3 does not inhibit PRV titers, but eliminates the ability of this virus to spread from cell to cell.",

For example, HCMV and MCMV are related viruses with similar replication cycles; however, they display very different sets of immunomodulatory genes [59, 60]. These unique sets of genes could be the cause of HCMV and MCMV unique responses to the antiviral state induced by the combination of TNF and IFN-\u03b3. This hypothesis is supported by our own observations that, at least in primary human fibroblasts, different members of the poxvirus family, which encode distinct immunomodulatory genes, display differential sensitivity to the synergistic antiviral state induced by TNF and IFN-\u03b2 (our unpublished observations). Alternatively, small differences in experimental design might lead to substantial disparities in the induced synergistic state. For example, it has been shown that TNF added either simultaneously or after IFN-\u03b3 synergistically reduces the titer of VSV up to four-logs. In the same system, however, if TNF is added a few hours before IFN-\u03b3 it has no synergistic effects [29\u2022\u2022]. Additionally, several groups have noted that addition of IFN-\u03b3 alone blocked HSV-1 early protein synthesis only when a low MOI was used [42, 61]. At higher MOI's, viral protein synthesis progressed normally in the presence of IFN-\u03b3, even though viral titer was still blocked. While these studies do not directly address the antiviral state induced by the combination of IFN-\u03b3 and TNF it seems likely that subtle differences in experimental design could have large impacts on the observed antiviral effects. It is also possible that IFN or TNF receptor density or signaling amplitudes vary in cultured cells during passage in culture.",

This suggests that simultaneous treatment with these cytokines synergistically activates signal transduction pathways and transcription factors. Surprisingly, little is known about this potential synergistic gene activation. Ruby et al. demonstrated that the antiviral effects of TNF require both the p55 and p75 TNFRs [62], however, the requirement for either or both of these receptors has not been examined in the context of TNF synergy with IFN-\u03b3. Robinson et al. further showed that treatment with TNF and IFN-\u03b3 results in activation of the signal transduction molecule STAT1 as well as synergistic increase in expression, DNA binding and activity of the transcription factor IRF1 [56\u2022\u2022]. Similar to these results, it has recently been shown that treatment of human macrophages with TNF alone leads to the STAT1 dependent activation of IRF1 resulting in increased expression of interferon dependent proinflammatory genes such as Cxcl10, Cxcl11 and INDO [37\u2022]. Thus, several different signaling pathways and transcription factors have been implicated in the antiviral synergy of TNF and IFN-\u03b3. More work, however, is needed before the mechanisms by which the cytokine-induced synergism of these pathways is fully elucidated.",
