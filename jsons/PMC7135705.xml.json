Global health involves social, political, economic, and environmental considerations that affect the health of communities and individuals around the world. Yet the same interconnectedness that facilitates the globalization of diseases is also manifested through the unprecedented interaction and cooperation between governments, civil society organizations, and individuals across time zones and borders to address health issues. Examples of this cooperation include large-scale multinational health efforts such as the United Nations Millennium Development Goals or the US President\u2019s Emergency Program for AIDS Relief.3 Technological advances that permit instant knowledge sharing around the world, creating the capacity to transform medical education and care, are also rapidly evolving. The problem is therefore linked to the solution. Globalization has produced new multidisciplinary multinational health challenges, and the global health issues of the modern world require coordinated multisectoral, multidisciplinary, and multinational efforts to achieve effective resolutions.",

This growth could have a major adverse impact on the availability of food, water, and other essential resources, as well as exacerbate pollution. Medical students should have an understanding of the health impacts of rapid population growth and unsustainable and inequitable consumption of essential resources, including water and food supply. Students should also be aware of regional variation in access to these resources and the effects of inequitable consumption on individuals and communities around the world. They should be able to describe the relationship between access to clean water, sanitation, and nutrition to individual and population health.",

Low-resource settings, including those among marginalized populations and rural environments in high-income countries, often face considerable human resource shortages within health care, as well as broader infrastructural inadequacies and barriers to prevention and treatment programs. These barriers may include inadequate local health system infrastructures; poor public infrastructure such as roads, schools, and telecommunications; cultural and linguistic barriers; low literacy rates; lack of health insurance; costs of medicines and therapies; advanced presentation of disease; lack of provider access to continuing education; and underutilization of available resources. Medical students should be aware of the realities of health care delivery in resource-poor settings and standards of clinical appropriateness in different environments. Further, students who travel abroad to participate in elective programs in low-resource settings should receive appropriate specialized orientation and training. This training should include such topics as personal health, travel safety, and ethical challenges that they may encounter, as well as competency with respect to the historical, sociopolitical, cultural, and linguistic contexts in which they will be learning.",

Although the process of integrating global health into medical education is well underway at some medical schools, there remain substantial challenges to initiating global health training in others. As a new field, faculties and schools may benefit from resources and guidance to develop global health modules and teaching materials. The GHEC/AFMC GHRG core competencies project was undertaken with the goal of providing guidance for those programs interested in adding global health content to their curricula. In addition, it is hoped that these recommendations will stimulate discussion among medical educators, students, professional educational organizations, and accreditation bodies regarding global health training in medical education to facilitate consensus on necessary competencies for students. Through the use of the proposed set of core competencies established by this project, it is hoped that this model will be shared among medical educators and programs in an effort to build a coordinated approach to global health in medical education.",
