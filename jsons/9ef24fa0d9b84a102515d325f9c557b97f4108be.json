A fragment of recombinant H5 subtype AIV hemagglutinin was produced and labeled with fluorescein to use it as a labeled antigen in FPIA. This labeled antigen was mixed with anti-AIV sera (H1-H16 subtypes) and FP of the mixture was measured using a portable FP analyzer on a microdevice. It was found that FP increased in proportion to the concentration of anti-H5 AIV antibody (serum) and was significantly higher than FP obtained with the other sera. The selective detection of anti-H5 subtype AIV antibody was confirmed. The required volume of original sample was 2 \u03bcL and analysis time was within 20 min. This detection system realizes an efficient on-site diagnosis and surveillance of AIV.",

Influenza A virus has many subtypes based on the type of virus surface glycoproteins, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). Wild aquatic birds are the primary natural host of influenza A virus, and 16 HAs (H1-H16) and 9 NAs (N1-N9) have been found so far in such birds [1, 2] . Avian influenza virus (AIV) usually infects intestinal cells of aquatic birds and does not show pathogenicity; however, it can infect poultry and cause pathogenicity [3, 4] . The virus that causes a high mortality when poultry were infected is designated as a highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV). To date, some H5 and H7 subtype AIVs have been reported to be HPAIVs [5] [6] [7] [8] . H5N1 subtype HPAIV, which appeared after 1996, has been reported not only in poultry but also in humans. The mortality rate for humans infected with H5N1 is reported to exceed 50% [9] . If these HPAIVs have acquired human-to-human infectivity, the deaths of many persons world-wide due to a pandemic become a concern.",

When a diagnosis is performed at the site of a disease outbreak, a rapid, simple and accurate antigen detection method is required. On the other hand, in the process from a disease occurrence to its cleanup and under a usual surveillance system, antibody detection to check for previous infections also plays an important role. Even in poultry that do not currently have the virus, the history of past infection can be determined by detecting antibodies. This is essential for investigating the routes of transmission of infectious diseases. As a recent example, antibody tests for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have received broad attention to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) [12, 13] . Although some antibody tests, such as the agar gel immunodiffusion test, hemagglutination inhibition test and enzymelinked immunosorbent assay are used for the detection of anti-AIV antibody [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] , these methods require complicated operations and a long reaction time. Therefore, it is impractical to use these methods outside the laboratory. If the method is developed that can rapidly and easily provide antibody test results outside the laboratory, field applications become possible and the surveillance system using the antibody test can be significantly strengthened.",

Advantages of FPIA compared to other immunoassays are the simplicity and rapidity of its procedures and the short measurement time. FPIA does not need a washing step and the reaction is completed by simply mixing the reagents together. In this study, we developed a system that selectively detected anti-H5 AIV serum by measuring P value of the mixture of an anti-AIV serum and fluorescein-labeled H5 subtype HA glycoprotein using a newly designed microdevice based on our previously developed microdevice with a portable FP analyzer [21] [22] [23] [24] (Fig. 1(a) ). Besides being portable, our FP analyzer is low cost and has high throughput, and these features make it possible to conduct FPIA outside the laboratory. All procedures from sampling to obtaining measurement results can be completed on-site, and that contributes to a significant increase in efficiency of diagnosis and surveillance.",

The viral RNA was extracted from the virus with Isogen-LS, and then reverse transcribed into cDNA by using SuperScript III Reverse Transcriptase.

The protein extracted from the bacteria was purified using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) agarose. The recombinant protein obtained was concentrated using an ultrafiltration membrane, and then dialyzed against PBS.

The PDMS prepolymer with black silicon rubber was poured onto the mold and cured. The cured PDMS was pasted on a glass slide. Figs. 1 (b) and (c) show a photograph and a schematic drawing of the microfluidic device. We designed the microfluidic device for this experiment based on the basic device. The microdevice had nine channels arranged in the field of view of the portable FP analyzer, and nine samples could be measured at one time. The width of the channel was 200 \u03bcm and the depth is 900 \u03bcm. The depth of the microfluidic device was significantly different from our previous device. By employing a channel having a high aspect ratio, it was possible to increase the fluorescence intensity per unit area and reduce specific surface area. These features contributed to highly sensitive measurement (Fig. S1 ).

A free fluorescence-labeled antigen emits random fluorescence when excited by polarized light and it gives a low P value. When a fluorescence-labeled antigen is bound to an antibody, P value is high due to the much slower Brownian motion of the antibody-H5-rHA complex [19, 20] . Fig. 2 shows the schematic illustration of FPIA in this work. When anti-H5 antibody in serum binds to a fluorescein-labeled H5-rHA, P value becomes high. Therefore, anti-H5 AIV serum containing a large amount of anti-H5 HA antibodies shows a higher P value than that of the antibodynegative serum. In this work, we used the fragment of H5-rHA (not whole H5-rHA) as an antigen to improve the sensitivity. Using a smaller fluorescence-labeled antigen reduces P value of the blank sample. Fig. 3 shows an example of a P image obtained using our portable FP analyzer. Samples used were a mixture of anti-H5 serum and fluorescein-labeled H5-rHA and a mixture of anti-H14 serum and fluorescein-labeled H5-rHA. Blank indicates only fluorescein-labeled H5-rHA.

Fig. 4 shows P value as a function of incubation time after mixing the fluorescein-labeled H5-rHA and anti-H5 serum. The solution mixture was incubated in a microtube for a certain time before being injected into a microdevice, and P value was measured with our portable FP analyzer. Time 0 means the fluorescein-labeled H5-rHA solution without anti-H5 serum. As the incubation time increased, P value increased and became an almost constant value at 5 min. Therefore, the change of P value due to the changing rotational motion of the fragment of recombinant H5 subtype AIV HA labeled by fluorescein could be detected by our analyzer. In the next experiments, the incubation period was set at 15 min at which time the reaction of the fluorescein-labeled H5-rHA and a serum was sufficiently progressed. Then, Fig. 5 shows the measured P value results after mixing fluorescein-labeled H5-rHA and anti-H5 AIV serum diluted with PBS. P value increased as the serum dilution rate decreased (increased concentration). The more antibodies the serum had, the greater the number of antigen-antibody complexes that were formed in the excess amount of fluorescein-labeled H5-rHA. Increasing P value with increasing concentration of serum meant that antigen-antibody complexes successfully formed. Therefore, we concluded that this fluorescein-labeled H5-rHA could be used for detection of anti-H5 antibody in serum. The limit of detection was about 20-fold dilution. Our microdevice required 20 \u03bcL of solution per one channel. Since serum and fluorescein-labeled H5-rHA were mixed at a volume ratio of 1 : 1, the required serum volume for an analysis was 10 \u03bcL. When a serum with 5fold dilution was used for the analysis, the required volume of the original serum was 2 \u03bcL. It would be sufficiently small for application to on-site diagnosis and surveillance. Therefore, 5-fold dilution of antiserum was used in the next experiment.",

The cutoff value for positive anti-H5 AIV antibody was defined as the average + 3SDs. Anti-H5 serum showed the highest P value among all anti-AIV sera and all other antisera except anti-H5 was below the cut-off value. Therefore, we showed that there was no false positive result with other anti-subtype sera. The incubation time was 15 min (total analysis time was within 20 min), which was significantly shorter than the time needed by conventional ELISA-based devices. These findings showed that our FPIA system selectively detected the anti-H5 AIV serum. Table 1 Immunogens of goat anti-AIV sera.",

Our portable FP analyzer with the microfluidic device makes it possible to conduct on-site analysis. Further study on blocking of protein adsorption to PDMS devices may lead to improved sensitivity and selectivity of a detection. By designing fluorescence-labeled antigen, this system can be applied to other viruses such as SARS-CoV-2. We may safely say that this system for antibody detection is ideal method for controlling infectious diseases by testing large numbers of samples. In the future, we plan to conduct experiments using real samples acquired in the field. ",
