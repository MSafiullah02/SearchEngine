            "text": "A newly identified coronavirus, 2019-nCoV, has been posing significant threats to public health since December 2019. ACE2, the host cell receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS), has recently been demonstrated in mediating 2019-nCoV infection. Interestingly, besides the respiratory system, substantial proportion of SARS and 2019-nCoV patients showed signs of various degrees of liver damage, the mechanism and implication of which have not yet been determined. Here, we performed an unbiased evaluation of cell type specific expression of ACE2 in healthy liver tissues using single cell RNA-seq data of two independent cohorts, and identified specific expression in cholangiocytes. The results indicated that virus might directly bind to ACE2 positive cholangiocytes but not necessarily hepatocytes. This finding suggested the liver abnormalities of SARS and 2019-nCoV patients may not be due to hepatocyte damage, but cholangiocyte dysfunction and other causes such as drug induced and systemic inflammatory response induced liver injury. Our findings indicate that special care of liver dysfunction should be installed in treating 2019-nCoV patients during the hospitalization and shortly after cure.",

A low throughput study of ACE2 protein expressions in selected cell types of multiple organs has shown a low frequency of ACE2 occurrence in cholangiocytes, but not in hepatocytes, Kupffer cells, and endothelial cells [11] , however the antibody detection might be subjected to non-specificity issue. Neither data sources could provide a definitive conclusion of cell type specific expression of ACE2 gene in liver. Recent advances of single cell technologies allow unbiased profiling of all cell types in given tissues at an unprecedented scale. To investigate the possible cause of 2019-nCoV patient liver damage, we used both published liver cell atlas data and an independent unpublished data generated in-house to evaluate ACE2 gene expression in all cell types in healthy livers.",

For the parenchymal cells, hepatocytes and cholangiocytes were identified by well-known markers ALB and KRT19 as well as stem cell marker CD24 and SOX4.We also identified leucocytes (PTPRC) by their classical lineage markers ( Figure 2C ), for example, CD3D/E/G for T lymphocytes; killer Cell lectin like receptors KLRD1 and KLRF1 as well as NKG7 in CD3 negative population for Natural killer (NK) cells; MS4A1, CD79A, and HLA-II molecules for antigen presenting B cells; and MZB1, JCHAIN and IGHG1 for plasma cells. For mononuclear phagocytes (MP) populations, Kupffer cells (KCs) (MARCO, CD163, VSIG4), monocytes (CD14, FCN1, VCAN), and conventional dendritic cells (cDCs) (CD1C, FCER1A, HLA-II) were annotated by their respective markers. In addition, neutrophils were identified by expression of specific marker of CSF3R, G0S2, CXCR2 and FCGR3B. We also confirmed a granulocyte progenitor cell cluster (MPO, ELANE, AZU1) and a small cluster of erythrocytes (HBA1, HBB). Other NPC types like endothelial cells and myofibroblasts were distinguished by pan-endothelial marker CDH5 and myoid marker ACTA2 and MYH11. Endothelial cells were further classified as liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSEC) and macrovascular endothelial cells (MaVEC) based on the different signatures [12].",

Since ACE2 is capable in mediating 2019-nCoV and SARS infections, its expression pattern reveals possibility for direct infection of cholangiocytes by 2019-nCoV and SARS. However, our findings suggest that hepatocytes might not be targeted by these viruses, or at least not through ACE2. Therefore, we speculate that liver damages in patients infected by 2019n-CoV might not be caused directly by viral infection of hepatocytes. Cholangiocytes are multifunctional and play critical roles in liver regeneration and immune responses [15]. Thus, the potential damage of cholangiocytes by 2019-nCoV may lead to profound consequences in the liver. Our findings also suggest that the liver abnormality of 2019-nCoV patients may be caused by drug used in the treatment, or systemic inflammatory responseinduced by pneumonias. We could not exclude the possibility of technical limitations in detecting extremely low ACE2 expression in hepatocytes at this point. This study demonstrated the highly sensitive nature of single-cell resolution analysis and facilitated the understanding of the mechanisms of liver malfunction in 2019-nCoV-infected patients. Such information call for patient cares regarding liver responses, especially related to cholangiocyte function, of the large number of 2019-nCoV patients currently under emergency and potential post-cure treatment for liver recovery after hospitalization.",

The novel coronavirus was isolated from the airway epithelial cells of patients with pneumonia that was epidemiologically linked to Huanan seafood market in Wuhan. Within 2 months, 2019-nCoV spreads rapidly from Wuhan to all provinces in China, and more than 20 countries around the globe. As of 20:00 on February 3, 2020, 17,335 cases were confirmed in China, 21,559 were suspected, with an alarming number of 361 fatalities. Unfortunately, the numbers of both infected patients and fatalities are still growing rapidly with no effective drugs clinically approved. 2019-nCoV is closely related to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), and was proposed to share the same receptor, angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), with SARS [2] [3] [4] .",
