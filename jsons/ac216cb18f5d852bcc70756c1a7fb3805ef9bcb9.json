In the absence of specific treatment for this virus, there is an urgent need to learn from the experience and lessons in China. To reduce the case-fatality rate among coronavirus disease 2019 patients, we should not ignore the complications, such as RNAaemia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and multiple organ dysfunction. To help understand the advantages and limitations of differential treatments, we provide a timely review and discuss the complications and corresponding major treatments, especially controversial ones such as antiviral therapy (remdesivir, ribavirin, and chloroquine), glucocorticoid therapy, extracorporeal support including an artificial liver system, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation based on available evidence. As a result, we suggest that antiviral therapy and organ function support are vital to reduce mortality for mild patients and critical patients, respectively.",

Given the treatments mentioned above, we will discuss antiviral therapy, glucocorticoid therapy, and extracorporeal support, including ECMO and artificial liver system (ALS) available for the treatment of COVID-19 based on current published evidence. Furthermore, we list a table to conclude the mechanism, advantages, and limitations for different treatments mentioned in this review (Table 2) The mechanism of remdesivir against the virus showed that the drug effectively inhibited the Ebola virus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) complex. 12, 13 The remdesivir could form remdesivir triphosphate (remdesivir-TP) in vivo, which was incorporated into the newly synthesized RNA chain of the virus as the substrate of the virus RdRp, thereby interrupting the transcription of the virus. 12 Another study showed that remdesivir-TP could compete with adenosine triphosphate (ATP). 14 After entering the cells, a monophosphoramidate prodrug of remdesivir transformed into triphosphate metabolite (NTP) in three steps, and NTP and ATP competed to bind viral RdRp. NTP was incorporated into the RNA synthesis chain, contributing to the termination of viral RNA synthesis and inhibiting RdRp enzyme activity. 12 In addition, remdesivir was used against a case of 2019 novel coronavirus, reported in N Engl J Med, leading to widespread interest. 15 In this case report, a patient with COVID-19 was treated by intravenous remdesivir without apparent adverse reactions on the evening of the seventh day of hospitalization. The patient's clinical symptoms improved on the eighth day after hospitalization (the 12th day after onset).",

In this review, we summarize and discuss Extracorporeal support (ALS and ECMO) should be considered under strict indications and contraindications; otherwise, the waste of resources and additional complications will be enormous. ECMO may be used more aggressively and many more ECMO devices could be transferred to Hubei Province in the future due to the temporary absence of effective antiviral drugs and the hope of reducing mortality. In conclusion, antiviral therapy and organ function support are most effective in reducing the mortality rate in patients with mild syndrome and patients in critical condition, respectively.",

As a potent inhibitor of SARS-CoV in cell culture, Keyaerts et al 35 reported that the half-maximal inhibitory concentration of chloroquine for antiviral activity was significantly lower than its cytostatic activity, which approximated that the plasma concentrations of chloroquine reached the level of acute malaria treatment even up to 5 hours after infection against SARS-CoV-infected Vero E6 cells. Chloroquine could also interfere with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, one of the binding sites for S protein, to inhibit SARS-CoV infection. 36 In vitro, the experiment also highlighted that chloroquine blocked COVID-19 virus infection at low-micromolar concentrations 11 with the possible mechanism of interfering with terminal glycosylation of the cellular receptor, ACE2, to negatively influence virus-receptor binding. 37 However, there are several limitations for further clinical application in patients.
