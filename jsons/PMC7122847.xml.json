Caused by a previously unrecognized coronavirus associated with the animal markets of southern China, the disease spread across the world via major air routes, reaching 29 countries on five continents (Guan et al. 2003). Later evidence strongly implicated insectivorous bats as the probable natural reservoir of the virus (Lau et al. 2005; Li et al. 2005; Ge et al. 2013). This discovery stimulated further investigations into a variety of wildlife species which revealed a plethora of new viruses carried by fruit and insectivorous bats, rodents and other species of wildlife from around the globe (Mackenzie and Jeggo 2013). Thus the SARS outbreak led to a number of important observations. It demonstrated that:a previously unknown pathogen could emerge from a wildlife source at any time and in any place and, without warning, threaten the health, well-being and economies of all societies;there was a clear need for countries to have the capability and capacity to maintain an effective alert and response system to detect and quickly react to outbreaks of international concern, and to share information about such outbreaks rapidly and transparently; andresponding to pandemic threats requires global cooperation and global participation.\n",

The H5N1 avian influenza threat persists (World Health Organization 2014a), but the more immediate concerns are the possible global spread of two novel viruses, avian influenza H7N9 and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). At the time of writing, there have been 432 human cases of avian influenza H7N9, most of which have occurred in mainland China with a few cases from China Taiwan and Hong Kong SAR (ProMED 2014; World Health Organization 2014b; Centre for Health Protection 2014). Surveillance at the animal-human interface is proving difficult because of the avirulence of the virus in domestic poultry (Chen et al. 2013). With MERS-CoV, 253 laboratory-confirmed cases have been reported at the time of writing, most of which have occurred in the Middle East (particularly in Saudi Arabia, but also including Jordan, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, and United Arab Emirates), but with sporadic cases in travellers from the Middle East to Europe (France, Germany, Greece, Italy and the United Kingdom), North Africa (Tunisia) and Asia (Malaysia and Philippines) (World Health Organization 2014c). Recent data has suggested that dromedary camels are the spill-over hosts of MERS-CoV and the source of most human infections (Alagaili et al. 2014; Meyer et al. 2014), although bats have been suggested as a possible reservoir (Memish et al. 2013).",

Over 2,500 years ago Hippocrates urged physicians that all aspects of their patients\u2019 lives need to be considered including their environment. However, the concept has been more commonly associated with the nineteenth century physician Rudolf Virchow, who acknowledged the similarities between human and animal medicine, and who first used the term \u2018zoonosis\u2019 for infections acquired from animals. Much more recently in the mid-1960s, the eminent American veterinary epidemiologist, Calvin Schwabe, also recognized that the health of humans, animals and ecosystems are interconnected, which he referred to as \u201cOne Medicine\u201d in his textbook \u201cVeterinary Medicine and Human Health\u201d (Schwabe 1984).",

Many of the important zoonoses relate to animals in the food production chain. Food, therefore, becomes an important vehicle for a substantial number of these zoonotic pathogens (Wielinga and Schlundt 2013), and food safety and food security are major OH issues, as clearly envisaged by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) (Lubroth 2013; FAO 2011), the United Nations (Nabarro 2012) and WHO. Indeed, within WHO, OH is located in the Food Safety and Food Security Division of the Health, Security and Environment cluster. Globalization of the food supply has increased the risks for outbreaks and spread of food-borne pathogens, and also for the emergence and spread of novel antibiotic resistance genes (IOM 2012; Wielinga and Schlundt 2013). The International Food Safety Authorities Network (INFOSAN), a joint program of FAO and WHO, with the Secretariat in WHO, links national authorities responsible for managing food safety emergencies (INFOSAN 2013).",

The goals of the partnership were to improve global readiness by elevating the issue on national agendas, leveraging resources, and building capacity to identify, contain and respond to pandemic influenza. The Secretary-General of the United Nations, Kofi Annan, subsequently announced that the UN family would do all it could to ensure all countries\u2014rich and poor\u2014were protected and prepared for a pandemic caused by avian influenza, and appointed a UN Systems Coordinator for Avian and Human Influenza (UNSIC). This proved to be a major leap forward in advancing One Health through bringing about collaboration between international organizations, regions and nations to discuss the ongoing pandemic threat posed by HPAI H5N1, and provided an excellent example of what can be done when specifically targeting collaborations between leaders in order to bring about change and action. This collaboration brought together international organizations, including FAO, WHO, the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE), the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF), the World Bank, and the EU, with various country representatives, and was the force behind the development of the International Ministerial Conferences on Avian and Pandemic Influenza (IMCAPI).",

The specific aim of the meeting was to identify clear and concrete actions to move the concept of OH from vision to implementation. Seven working groups were identified as being crucial steps in attaining the 3\u20135 year vision. These were: (1) \u2018Training\u2019 to develop and build skills, expertise and competencies through a OH curriculum; (2) a \u2018One Health Global Network\u2019 as a means of gaining international support and as a vehicle to stimulate further global collaboration; (3) an \u2018Information Clearing House\u2019 to promote advocacy through providing information on success stories and lessons learned; (4) \u2018Needs Assessment\u2019, by developing country-level self-assessment methods to identify activities which could benefit from a OH approach; (5) \u2018Capacity Building\u2019, by identifying ways to leverage existing programs and capacity-building efforts to have a major impact at minimal cost; (6) \u2018Proof of Concept\u2019, through demonstrating a retrospective and prospective evidence base that the use of OH interventions and/or concepts leads to better cross-species health outcomes; and (7) a \u2018Business Plan\u2019, by articulating the concept of and rationale for OH more clearly and presenting this information to policymakers and donors worldwide (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2010). Outcomes from the working groups are, with some exceptions, still progressing (Stone Mountain Workgroups 2011; 2012; Rubin 2013). The workgroup to develop an \u2018Information Clearing House\u2019 was subsequently combined with the \u2018One Health Global Network workgroup and, led by the group chair Dr Vandersmissen, the One Health Global Network (www.onehealthglobal.net) was successfully launched in 2012. The Proof of Concept working group has also reviewed and assembled evidence to demonstrate that proof of concept for a OH approach to EID threats is feasible through cross-sectoral integration between human, animal and environmental health sectors. It concluded that bigger and more controlled comparative studies of OH disease prediction and control strategies are needed, such as larger implementation of surveillance systems integrating human, animal and environmental data, and larger controlled intervention trials (Rabinowitz et al. 2013).",

As examples, nations as diverse as the United Kingdom (UK), France, Sweden, Laos, Thailand, Mongolia, Canada and Tanzania, to name but a few, have set up national OH entities within or supported by government and varying in scope and resources. France has endorsed support for the Tripartite Collaboration and has committed to align its strategies and activities with the Tripartite Collaboration (French Government 2011; Hall and Coghlan 2011). In the UK, a cross-government approach chaired by Public Health England entitled \u2018Human Animal Infections and Risk Surveillance (HAIRS) group\u2019 provides a One Health approach to zoonoses and emerging infections across Government, and has been operating since 2004. It acts as a horizon-scanning group to identify emerging zoonoses which may pose a future threat, and brings together representatives from human and animal health from the Departments and Agencies across the UK (Public Health England 2014). Developing countries appear to be more successful in implementing OH programs than developed countries, due in large part to the fact that limited resources make it necessary for different sectors to work closely together, whereas more developed nations have older, established and more rigid public health structures with well-defined responsibilities met using a fairly narrow range of disciplines.",

A good example of how this is working in practice can be seen in Mongolia. Coordination mechanisms established between veterinary and public health sectors in Mongolia are proving crucial in addressing issues of food safety, emergency disease management and the impact of climate change on disease emergence. Tuberculosis, anthrax, rabies and brucellosis are managed through the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) which adopts the OH approach involving both veterinarians and medical professionals. It is proposed to establish a \u201cCentre\u201d or \u201cNational Hub\u201d for the further development of coordination mechanisms between relevant sectors, including animal and human sectors, food safety authorities, wildlife management authorities, border quarantine services and environmental health personnel, at all levels (sub-national, national, sub-regional, regional). This Centre will deal not only with the immediate threats but longer time risk reduction strategies. Increased and improved national surveillance, more comprehensive risk assessment, and the development of a broader based response capability will be further developed based on multilevel, multidisciplinary and multi-sectoral coordination through this national Center. This example in Mongolia provides a snapshot of what is being developed in countries in both Asia and Africa (Batsukh et al. 2013; Mazet et al. 2009; Hall and Coghlan 2011; Hueston et al. 2013).",

Laos has an ideal platform for the spread of trans-boundary and emerging zoonotic pathogens through a complex web of wildlife, livestock and human interfaces, extending from remote protected areas to the center of the capital city, Vientiane. Wildlife is still widely hunted across the country, eaten by villagers for subsistence, traded locally in wet and medicinal markets, and transported widely for domestic and international trade. The extensive and often geographically rugged borders of land-locked Laos are extremely porous and movement of wildlife products, livestock, and other items are pervasive, both into and out of the country, representing a potentially significant conduit for the movement of novel pathogens. Bovine cysticercosis, tuberculosis, Q fever, brucellosis and leptospirosis are of particular concern (Vongxay et al. 2012). Laos has seen high levels of economic growth in the last decade and along with this growth have come new roads, many extractive and hydroelectric industries, and an increase in intensive farming resulting in large swathes of deforestation and dramatic land-use changes. All of these activities have the potential to alter disease ecology and in order to respond effectively to these challenges, Laos has reorganized to ensure effective collaboration between the animal and human health sectors. With support from a number of international agencies and NGOs, there is a significant shift towards a whole of Government and OH approach to tackling health issues, whether it be human, livestock or the environment.",

Key international surveillance networks are the Global Early Warning System for Major Animal Diseases (GLEWS), developed by FAO, OIE and WHO (GLEWS 2013), and also the Global Alert and Response Operations (GAR) of WHO. Coordinated rapid outbreak response is provided by WHO\u2019s Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN), a network of technical institutions, research institutes, universities, international health organizations and technical networks willing to contribute and participate in international coordinated responses to infectious disease outbreaks (Mackenzie et al. 2014). FAO and OIE have also collaborated to develop a network of Expertise on Animal Influenza (OFFLU 2013). While there is no mechanism presently available to permit early and rapid detection of potential human pathogens at the human\u2013animal interface, the PREDICT program of the USAID\u2019s Emerging Pandemic Threats has the potential to do this by detecting spillovers of pathogens from wildlife using their SMART (Strategic, Measurable, Adaptive, Responsive, and Targeted) surveillance method (Morse et al. 2012; PREDICT 2013). Animal disease surveillance or outbreak investigation is, in general, fragmentary, and tends to be highly focused on domestic livestock and supporting trade in livestock and livestock products. New platforms for pathogen discovery integrated with new surveillance procedures targeted at the animal\u2013human interface are needed. In response to these needs, innovative molecular diagnostic platforms have been developed which have changed the face of pathogen discovery and detection with enormous sensitivity and specificity (Lipkin 2013), and novel procedures for targeted surveillance have been generated through the PREDICT program (Morse et al. 2012). For non OIE-listed emerging and reemerging diseases, the very recently launched OIE web application named WAHIS-wild interface will potentially assist in surveillance of wild animal diseases (OIE 2014).",

The SMART surveillance method developed by PREDICT is designed to detect novel diseases with pandemic potential early, giving health professionals the best opportunity to prevent emergence and spread. It also targets sentinel animal species at active human interfaces in specific hotspots to increase potential of success (PREDICT 2013). The Emerging Pandemic Threats program has additional projects linked to PREDICT, which are PREVENT, IDENTIFY, and RESPOND (USAID 2013). Importantly, the PREDICT project builds on a broad coalition of partners and thus provides a capacity building component in a collaborative framework. These surveillance systems are now established and improving and to date have received dedicated funding.",

As described previously, the emergence of new infectious diseases is increasing, as is the pathogenicity and distribution of re-emergent infectious diseases, with zoonotic infections predominating and primarily from wildlife.

This was supported by Dr Suwit Wibulpolprasert, senior advisor in disease control to the Ministry of Health, Thailand, who emphasized the need for social equity and justice in his keynote speech at the International Congress for One Health in Melbourne in 2011. He stated that a more sustainable world is a more just world (Wibulpolprasert 2011). Some of the ways in which One Health approaches can learn from many tenets of the paradigm of social-ecological systems was discussed by Ross (2013).",

However, there is little interest in any form of \u2018global governance\u2019: OH is a concept or approach not an association or society. Identifying a body that can lead relationship development between major disciplines and foster a true trans-disciplinary approach, develop global guidelines and strategies, and ensure sustainable funding is needed, probably in an advisory capacity. The recent establishments of groups doing this at the regional level in developing countries (e.g. SACID) do seem to be achieving success in operationalizing OH at the national level and a similar approach could be emulated at the international level. In its most recent guise, OH is still just an approach for detecting and managing global health at the animal\u2013human-environment interfaces, albeit relatively recent, and requires nurturing and further development to realize its full potential. It has been suggested that there should be a One Health Global Guidance Group as one of the outcomes of Stone Mountain, but this has still to be widely accepted. To some, this should be part of the leadership devolved to FAO, OIE and WHO, with an invitation list of international experts added to form an \u2018oversight\u2019 group. The importance of food safety and security is reason enough to support their leadership. However, there is no doubt that there is increasing global support for the usefulness and value of the OH approach for the detection and response to diseases at the animal\u2013human-ecosystems interfaces in a transparent, collaborative, and multi-disciplinary way, and that this approach will become an essential component to future global health, and to the provision of safe food and water for an increasingly hungry world.",
