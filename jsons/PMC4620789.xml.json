In addition, children with RSV infections are also exposed to a variety of other respiratory viruses with a similar seasonal pattern, mainly during winter months, such as influenza, rhinovirus (RV), human metapneumovirus (hMPV), and human bocavirus (HBoV).1 Despite the fact that numerous studies have revealed that an important number of ARI pediatric patients become simultaneously infected with multiple respiratory viruses, there are few studies focused on analyzing viral coinfections. This issue usually becomes a marginal part of the studies.",

Although they were mainly dual infections, 3 or more viruses were also detected simultaneously. The most frequent dual infection was between RSV and RV, and the second was between RSV and HBoV. Nevertheless, coinfections with all respiratory viruses were detected. Adenovirus coinfections were the third most frequent, but the majority of them were found as multiple viral associations with inadequate dual cases for analysis. There are some systematic reviews about coinfections with different results. We focus our attention towards 1 study conducted in the United States, with data corresponding to a single hospital, and the authors found that dual infections had more ratio of hospitalizations than single infections.13 However, recently, 2 other reviews have been published and do not find evidences suggesting that there are any differences in disease severity between coinfections compared to single viral infections.14,15 Only one of them was performed in children.14 We agree with the appreciation that coinfections do not increase the severity, and in anyway, we think that studies should focus on dual versus multiple infections, since the different characteristics of the virus can cause a bias when analyzing the results all together. One of the strengths of our study is that we analyzed virus in pairs and only when the number of infected patients to compare was big enough to allow us to draw conclusions. To our knowledge, our study has the highest number of patients in pairs of virus to date.",

Children with confections were around 1 year old, whereas RSV single infections affected younger infants and RV was found in older children of almost 2 years of age. In our series, coinfections had significantly more proportion of fever, and also more proportion of hypoxia than single infections of RSV o RV. The coinfections had a risk of fever 1.9 times higher than single infections, and the risk of hypoxia was twice as high. The presence of RSV implies a worse prognosis with increased duration of both hypoxia and days of hospitalization, whether in simple infection or in coinfection. The risk of admission in PICU was 2.2 (CI 1.1\u20134.4) in patients with coinfections versus in those with RV single infections, but there were no differences in patients with RSV single infections. This supports the idea that RSV infection causes the severity. There are few studies focused on coinfections between RSV and RV, and the number of patients analyzed is still small. The most extensive evaluation of the role of RV infections, whether single or multiple in children, is the study by Costa and Queir\u00f3z.16 They analyzed 181 inpatient and outpatient children with RV infections, and 74 of them had coinfections, mainly with RSV. They found that RV single infections were less severe than coinfections RV plus RSV, requiring less proportion of hospital admission. Patients with single RV were older than single RSV and coinfections, and the most frequent diagnosis was recurrent wheezing. Similar to our series, there were no differences between RSV and coinfections of RV plus RSV with regard to severity.",

Nevertheless, the severity of the illness was associated with HBoV infections in children attending daycare,20 and reinfections contribute to long-term shedding.23 On the contrary, other studies have suggested that HBoV is the most likely cause of respiratory tract disease if the patient has a single infection, high viral load in NPA, and viremia.24,25 A severe and life-threatening disease has recently been well documented in an 8-month-old child with acute respiratory distress in Germany.26 Also, HBoV has been detected as the third agent causing confirmed pneumonia,27,28 and so, all of them support the pathogenic role of this virus. And finally, serologic diagnosis of HBoV has confirmed that it is a true pathogen in respiratory tract infections in children.29 Unfortunately, this tehchnique is not yet available in many laboratories including ours.",

In contrast, pneumonia was much more frequent in children with HBoV; this could explain the higher WBC counts and CRP levels in these patients. Dual RSV and HBoV shared clinical characteristics from both viruses, and the most frequent clinical diagnosis in these children was recurrent wheezing. We can show results with our series in which HBoV infections have a pathogenic role.

In our study, during 8 consecutive seasons, we only found 3 dual coinfections.
