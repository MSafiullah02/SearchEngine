Although SARS appears to have been successfully contained, re-emergence of the disease cannot be ruled out. This is supported by the fact that four laboratory-acquired and four community-acquired SARS cases were reported in Singapore, Taiwan and China after the SARS outbreak (www.who.int/csr/sars/en). Therefore, development of effective vaccines against SARS is urgently needed.",

            "text": "SARS-CoV is a single-stranded positive RNA virus, whose genome encodes nonstructural replicase polyprotein (rep), and structural proteins such as spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N) (Anand et al., 2003, Marra et al., 2003, Rota et al., 2003). S protein recognizes and binds to host receptors, and the conformational changes induced in this viral protein would then facilitate fusion between the viral envelope and the host cell membranes, thus S plays pivotal roles in viral infection and pathogenesis (Hofmann et al., 2004, Holmes, 2003, Yu et al., 2003, Zheng et al., 2005). S protein is a type I transmembrane glycoprotein consisting of S1 and S2 domains (Bosch et al., 2003, Holmes and Enjuanes, 2003, Krokhin et al., 2003, Ying et al., 2004; Fig. 1\n). The S1 domain determines the host cell tropism by attaching to cell receptors, and the S2 domain is mainly responsible for the virus and cell membrane fusion (Bosch et al., 2003, Gallagher and Buchmeier, 2001). Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been identified as a functional receptor for SARS-CoV (Dimitrov, 2003, Li et al., 2003, Prabakaran et al., 2004), and a 193-aa fragment containing residues 318\u2013510 of the S1 region is found to be the minimal receptor-binding domain (RBD) (Babcock et al., 2004, Wong et al., 2003, Xiao et al., 2003; Fig. 1). A second major property of SARS-CoV S protein is that it induces neutralizing antibodies and protective immunity (Bisht et al., 2004, Buchholz et al., 2004, Bukreyev et al., 2004, Yang et al., 2004). Yang et al. (2004) reported that a DNA vaccine encoding S protein was able to induce T-cell and neutralizing-antibody responses (neutralizing antibody titers range from 1:50 to 1:150). They proved that protection of mice against SARS-CoV challenge was mediated by neutralizing antibodies but not a T-cell-dependent mechanism. Traggiai et al. (2004) demonstrated that protective immunity in mice could be achieved by sole administration of neutralizing monoclonal antibodies specific for S protein. These data suggest that an effective SARS vaccine can be developed based on its ability to induce neutralizing antibodies. We previously reported that RBD of SARS-CoV S protein was able to elicit potent neutralizing antibodies in rabbits (He et al., 2004a). Furthermore, RBD has also been found to be an immunogenic domain of SARS-CoV, which induced neutralizing antibodies in SARS-CoV infected patients (He et al., 2004b). Therefore, S protein, especially RBD in the S1 domain, is a good target for developing vaccines against SARS (He et al., 2004b, Yang et al., 2004).",

The S2 domain contains heptad repeat 1 and 2 (HR1 and HR2) and a transmembrane domain TM (Fig. 1A). In the construction of the pRBD-AAV vector, the nucleotide sequence encoding SP was replaced by the CD5 and the latter was ligated to the RBD sequence of SARS-CoV S, and the chimeric gene was subcloned into the multiple cloning sites (MCS) of the pAAV-IRES-hrGFP plasmid (Stratagene, USA) (Fig. 1B). The resulting pRBD-AAV plasmid, or the blank pAAV plasmid, was co-transfected into 293T cells together with pAAV-RC and pHelper plasmids to produce AAV, which harbors the chimeric CD5-RBD gene (RBD-rAAV) or that which does not harbor the chimeric gene (blank AAV). Intense fluorescence of the humanized recombinant green fluorescent protein (hrGFP) in RBD-AAV (Fig. 2A) and blank AAV (Fig. 2B) was observed in the transfected cells under a fluorescence microscopy at 72 h post-transfection, illustrating a high transfection efficiency of the viral plasmids in 293T cells. The yield of either the RBD-rAAV or the blank AAV from the respective transfected cells harvested from 30 \u00d7 100 mm tissue culture dishes was purified and the titer was estimated by real-time quantitative PCR to be 5 \u00d7 1012 viral particles/ml.",

Fluorescence microscopy shows that 293T cells infected with the rAAVs (Fig. 3A) are more numerous than HeLa cells (Fig. 3B).

The animals were bled before immunization and at 1, 2 and 4 months post-vaccination. Levels of SARS-CoV-specific antibodies in these serum samples were determined by ELISA. As shown in Fig. 5A, the titers of SARS-CoV-specific antibodies in the sera from single dose of RBD-rAAV immunized mice reached 1:680 \u00b1 120 (mean \u00b1 SE) at 1 month and slightly increased to 1:880 \u00b1 160 at 4 months post-vaccination.

SARS-CoV neutralizing activity in the mouse sera was further tested by a neutralization assay in Vero E6 cells according to method described by Qu et al. (2005).

By comparison, the antibody level of animals given the inactivated virus vaccination peaked earlier, at 2 months after immunization. The peak level of neutralizing antibody of the animals vaccinated with the RBD-rAAV is similar as that of vaccinated with the inactivated virus suspended in Alum (1:109 \u00b1 18, P > 0.05), but it is almost 3-fold higher than that was given the inactivated virus suspended in PBS (1:42 \u00b1 10, P < 0.05). No SARS-CoV neutralizing antibodies (<1:20) could be detected in the mouse sera from blank AAV immunized group. The results indicated that although the RBD-rAAV vaccination induced a lower level of neutralizing antibody than vaccination with SARS-CoV plus Alum at 1\u20132 months after immunization, it can deliver a prolonged effect with an increasing neutralizing antibody titer at 4 months post-vaccination, which was similar or higher than inactivated virus vaccination with or without Alum (P > 0.05).",

It has been reported that neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV S protein are able to provide protection against SARS-CoV infection (Bisht et al., 2004, Bukreyev et al., 2004, Sui et al., 2004). Although multiple fragments of S protein have been shown to be able to elicit neutralizing activities (Keng et al., 2005, Zhang et al., 2004), RBD, the receptor-binding domain to the functional virus receptor ACE2, which contains multiple conformation-dependent epitopes, can effectively induce highly potent protective neutralizing antibodies (Chen et al., 2005, He et al., 2004b, He et al., 2005a). A recent study also demonstrated that the RBD region is the main target in eliciting neutralizing antibodies in inactivated SARS-CoV immunized rabbits, and an important immunogenic site in patients infected with SARS-CoV (He et al., 2005b). Therefore, RBD of SARS-CoV S protein was selected as the target immunogen in our study for development of SARS-CoV vaccines.",

It was further demonstrated that the mouse sera induced by the RBD-rAAV vaccination were able to effectively suppress RBD binding to ACE2 (Fig. 7), suggesting that the neutralizing activity were mediated by inhibition of the virus binding to its receptor on the host cell membrane. It has been reported that levels of SARS-CoV neutralizing antibody found in convalescent sera of recovered SARS patients ranged from 1:40 to 1:1280 (Zheng et al., 2004). Another study also shows that the titer of 1:100 of SARS-CoV neutralizing antibody elicited by a recombinant attenuated modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) encoding SARS S protein protected immunized mice from SARS-CoV challenge (Bisht et al., 2004). Our results suggested that one dose vaccination of RBD-rAAV may provide sufficient protection against the SARS-CoV infection.",

However, our results showed that the primary vaccination with RBD-rAAV did not affect the repeated vaccinations. The neutralizing antibody level markedly increased after the mice were boosted twice, reaching the mean titer of 1:512 that was 5-fold higher than the mice that received one dose of vaccination (Fig. 6). This may be attributed to that the low antigenicity of the AAV delivery vector used in this study minimized the host immune response to the delivery vector itself.",

This may be due to that the gene expression of the recombinant AAV goes through a slow onset firstly, taking a course of a few days or weeks, followed by persistent gene expression for many months, which is supported by reports that the AAV may long-term express foreign genes in vivo in different organisms without resulting in significant toxicity (Monahan and Samulski, 2000, Rabinowitz and Samulski, 1998, Smith-Arica and Bartlett, 2001). However, we cannot conclude if the antibody response has reached the highest level at the study end time and how long the high level of specific antibodies will be maintained in these RBD-rAAV-vaccinated mice, because we did not monitor the antibody responses for more than 5.5 months post-immunization.",

The single dose of intramuscular immunization of RBD-rAAV induced viral-specific antibody responses, whose titer was significantly higher than that of the inactivated virus vaccination. The repeated vaccination elicited a prolonged immune response, resulting in an increase of SARS-CoV neutralizing antibody in vaccinated mice up to the end point of this study. Another advantage of the vaccines based on the live AAV delivery system is that it may be used for mucosal immunization to induce local immune response. It has been reported that high titers of fecal HIV-specific IgA and neutralizing antibodies were detected in HIV-rAAV immunized mice (Xin et al., 2001). A study of RBD-rAAV intranasal vaccination is in progress to further demonstrate the feasibility of the live AAV recombinant vaccine in development of SARS vaccines.",

Serial 2-fold dilutions of serum samples were separately mixed with 100 TCID50 (50% tissue-culture infectious dose) of SARS-CoV GZ50 strain (GenBank accession no. AY304495), incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 h, and added to the monolayer of Vero E6 cells. In each assay, a virus back-titration (virus in serial 2-fold dilutions with medium), virus positive control (100 TCID50) and negative cell controls with medium were also included in parallel with the neutralization test. Cytopathic effect (CPE) was observed daily and the endpoints were read and recorded up to 3 days post-infection. The neutralizing antibody titer was determined based on the highest dilution of each serum, which completely suppressed CPE induced by the virus.",
