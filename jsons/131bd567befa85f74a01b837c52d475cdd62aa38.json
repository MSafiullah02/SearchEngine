There is some role of antibiotics for the prevention of COPD exacerbations. 14, 15 Antibiotics for patients admitted to the intensive care unit for COPD exacerbations also appeared to be beneficial. 16, 17 There is still continued uncertainty in asthmatic patients, with macrolide antibiotics providing some benefit in patients with stable disease, 18, 19 whereas in patients with acute exacerbations, some benefit was demonstrated with telithromycin 20 but not azithromycin. 21 In the latter study almost half of those screened had already received antibiotics in primary care, and the study was underpowered. The lack of response observed might have been a consequence of failure to include those most likely to respond to antibiotics. With advances in culture-independent techniques, we can now study the role of the lung microbiome in respiratory diseases to a better extent. Of interest, Wang et al 22 have found that lung microbiome dynamics were associated with COPD exacerbations. Therefore identification of biomarkers and a biologic cluster with evidence of microbial dysbiosis might enable future targeted antibiotic trials. The P/F ratio is also emerging as a possible simple measure that reflects bacterial composition, and whether this can be applied in future intervention studies to guide therapies needs to be tested. 23, 24 Cluster 2 would seem likely to respond to therapies targeting eosinophilic and T2 inflammation. Targeting eosinophilic inflammation in both asthmatic patients and patients with COPD with corticosteroids reduces exacerbation frequency. 12, 25, 26 Likewise, mAb therapies targeting the IL-5 cytokine and its receptor are effective for decreasing the risk of exacerbation in patients with eosinophilic asthma, 27-34 with evidence of some benefit, although less consistent, in patients with eosinophilic COPD. 35, 36 Findings from 2 pivotal phase III studies evaluating the efficacy and safety of mepolizumab, an anti-IL-5 mAb, in addition to standard of care in patients with COPD demonstrated reductions in the frequency of moderateto-severe exacerbations in those with higher blood eosinophil counts. 37 Our study underscores the importance of an eosinophilic phenotype in asthmatic patients and patients with COPD, but future studies need to consider whether the underlying mechanisms are common in asthmatic patients and patients with COPD. One limitation was that IgE levels were not assessed at exacerbation, and the role of allergy could be explored further in future studies.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 286, "end": 289, "text": "14,", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 409, "end": 412, "text": "16,", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 559, "end": 562, "text": "18,", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1545, "end": 1548, "text": "23,", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 1787, "end": 1790, "text": "12,", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1791, "end": 1794, "text": "25,", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 2058, "end": 2061, "text": "35,", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "The interferon-inducible chemokines CXCL10 and CXCL11 in sputum and serum were not only increased in cluster 3 but were also increased significantly at exacerbation compared with those in the stable state. This biologic cluster with high levels of interferon-inducible chemokines was not observed previously in patients with stable asthma and those with COPD. 7 Because these chemokines have been identified as biomarkers of virus-associated exacerbations, 4,38,39 it would seem likely that viral infections are possible triggers and that this cluster would be most amenable to future antiviral interventions. Consistently, the proportion of virus-associated exacerbations was greater in cluster 3, but this did not reach statistical significance between clusters with asthma and COPD combined or independently. Viral identification is challenging, especially because sputum viral load can peak before the peak of lower respiratory symptoms. 40 Therefore our findings likely underrepresented the proportion of virus-associated exacerbations.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "One major limitation of this study is that the number of patients with asthma was small and the percentage of both asthmatic patients and patients with COPD who provided sufficient samples to study the microbial ecology was approximately half of the patients. The remaining patients were unable to produce sufficient sputum for analysis. The clinical characteristics between those who did versus those who did not provide samples for microbiological assessment were similar, suggesting these groups were comparable. We cannot exclude the possibility of an acquisition bias toward a microbial ecology associated with more sputum production. Notwithstanding this limitation, we did find consistent differences in the microbial ecology between the clusters.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "Second, we cannot demonstrate the stability of these exacerbation biologic clusters based on assessment of a single exacerbation. Therefore these findings need to be explored in larger multicenter studies. Another limitation of the size of the study is that we could not analyze the patients according to the severities of their asthma or COPD or the severities of exacerbations. We did not control for baseline therapy between asthmatic patients and patients with COPD; however, the corticosteroid dosages were very similar between the groups, which indicates this was unlikely to have had a differential effect on the underlying inflammatory or microbial profile. A limitation of cluster analysis is that it is specific to the data set studied, and therefore neither the asthma and COPD groups nor the stable visits can be analyzed independently to generate the proportions of the same clusters. This means cluster stability cannot be simply determined. However, we found that the patterns of the inflammatory profiles were similar for those asthmatic patients or patients with COPD between clusters; the patterns were similar between the stable and exacerbation state for the proinflammatory (cluster 1) and eosinophilic (cluster 2) phenotypes, with amplification of an underlying inflammatory profile at the exacerbation event. However, the T1 mediators that were increased at exacerbation in cluster 3 were not increased in the stable state. Whether the stable state mediator profiles can identify subjects most likely to respond to specific anti-inflammatory or antibiotic therapy to reduce future exacerbation risk requires further study. We included a large number of cytokines and chemokines in the analysis, but this still only reflects a minority of the number of mediators present in the sputum and serum samples. Because of limitations of the available sample, we could not extend the study to include other important mediators, such as eicosanoids and b-interferons. Metabolomic approaches, such as somologics, might provide more insight into the inflammatory mediator network and should be considered in future studies.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "In conclusion, we used a biologic clustering approach to look at asthma and COPD exacerbations.
