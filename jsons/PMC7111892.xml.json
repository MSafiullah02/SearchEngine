A large number of serotypes and genotypes of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) strains have been reported worldwide (de Wit et al., 2011a, Jackwood, 2012). This appears to be due to constant changes in the spike-protein of IBV strains resulting in the emergence of new IBV variants (Cavanagh, 2007). In the winter of 2000, a severe outbreak of renal disease occurred in several broiler farms in Israel. An IBV strain, designated IS/885/00, was isolated from the kidneys of these flocks (Meir et al., 2004).",

In addition, an increasing number of strains closely related to IS/885/00 have been reported in Israel (Meir et al., 2004), Egypt (Abdel-Moneim et al., 2012), Iraq (Mahmood et al., 2011), Libya (Awad et al., 2014a) and other Middle East countries (Ganapathy et al., 2015). To date, through our diagnostic services, we have detected this strain in samples received from France, Ukraine and Pakistan. These strains were detected from broiler and layer flocks experiencing respiratory distress, renal lesions and high mortality (Meir et al., 2004, Selim et al., 2013, Awad et al., 2014a).",

Initial isolation was carried out in the virology laboratory at Cairo University, Egypt, and the AF was submitted to the Italian laboratory. There, the AF went through three further passages in embryonated chicken eggs (ECEs) and was shown to be negative for avian influenza virus (AIV) and Newcastle disease virus (NDV) and positive for IBV by RT-PCR. Positive IBV amplicons were submitted for commercial sequencing (Source BioScience) of a 393 bp region of the hypervariable S1 region (Cavanagh et al., 1999). Sequence (GenBank Accession: awaiting) analysis of the IS/885 inoculum showed 90% nucleotide identity to the Israeli strain IS/885/00 (Meir et al., 2004) using BLAST (NCBI database).",

In addition to the respiratory signs, gross lesions comprising of tracheal caseous exudate and plugs, and swollen kidneys (with or without) urate deposits were observed. Such clinical signs have been observed following infection with virulent IBV M41(Butcher et al., 1990), Moroccan G strain (Ambali and Jones, 1990), 793B (Boroomand et al., 2012), It-02 (Dolz et al., 2012) and QX (Ganapathy et al., 2012). These clinical signs and lesions were more severe in SPF than in the broiler chicks, indicating differences in the susceptibility to IBV infection in these different types of birds. This could be due to the genetic line of the birds or the IBV MDAs in the broiler chicks which probably neutralized certain amounts of IBVs (Ignjatovic et al., 2003). Previous studies using virulent IBV M41 demonstrated a considerable difference between two white leghorn chick lines in terms of the severity and duration of respiratory signs (Otsuki et al., 1990).",

Cystic oviduct formation following infection of virulent IBVs at a young age has been reported for IBV M41 (Crinion et al., 1971, Crinion and Hofstad, 1972, Jones and Jordan, 1972) and, recently, QX (Benyeda et al., 2009, de Wit et al., 2011b, Ganapathy et al., 2012). We report, for the first time, similar pathological development in SPF chicks that received the IS/885 virus at 1-day old. In addition, virus with 86% part-S1 sequence identity to the original inoculum was isolated from the cystic fluid. The detection of IBV IS/885 in the oviduct fluid demonstrates both active replication of the virus in the epithelium and its abundance in the fluid and these were shed by epithelial cells. The epithelial cells of the oviduct are the primary cells infected by IBV (Crinion and Hofstad, 1972). The IS/885 infection has caused a diffuse loss in the cilia, epithelial necrosis and infiltration of lymphocytes and plasma cells into the oviduct which suggests that the virus has replicated in the epithelial lining of the oviduct.",

IBV Conn and Iowa failed to produce any gross or histopathological change in the oviduct, in contrast, IBV M41 produces the greatest number of changes, followed by Australian T (Crinion and Hofstad, 1972). Benyeda et al. (2009) did not detect any abnormalities in the oviducts of 793B infected one-day-old SPF chicks, whereas a variable percentage of oviduct dilatations were detected following inoculation with five different QX-like strains.

In this work, the SPF chicks had greater necrosis in the trachea, indicating a more extensive virus replication than broiler chicks, which may have been due to extravasation of circulating maternal antibody in the latter. In both types of birds, severe and early onset of histopathological lesions was seen in the trachea, compared to relatively mild lesions in the kidney. Nephropathogenic IBVs have shown tropism for respiratory and kidney tissues although kidney lesions are more apparent (Albassam et al., 1986, Butcher et al., 1989). Based on these findings, the IS/885 strain appears to have an affinity for both respiratory and renal tissues.",

For HI, sera were assayed against M41 and 793B since most producers use live and inactivated vaccines related to these serotypes. IS/885 antigen was also used as a homologous comparison. With HI, distinctive patterns were seen in broiler chicks; higher mean HI titres against M41 and 793B at day-old reflects the maternal antibodies derived from parent birds that were previously vaccinated using Massachusetts, 793B or D274 vaccines. For 3, 6 and 9 days post infection, though there were no significant differences between the IS/885-infected broiler chicks, the titres declined against all three HI antigens. From 15 days post infection, the mean HI titres against M41, 793B and IS/885 peaked by 21 days post infection and then declined by 28 days post infection. In contrast to day-old sera, the mean titer is highest for the IS/885 antigen, reflecting a better reactivity with the homologous antigen. These significant levels of HI antibodies against the IS/885 antigen were observed when compared to the level of antibody response against M41 and 793B antigens in IS/885-infected birds. This finding supports the use of the homologous virus as an antigen in the HI test, as it has been reported that the HI test is strain specific (Monreal et al., 1985, de Wit et al., 1997).",
