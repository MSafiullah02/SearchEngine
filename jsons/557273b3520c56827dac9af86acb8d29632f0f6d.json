            "text": "Known bacterial pathogens cannot be implicated in up to 75% of outbreaks of acute diarrhoeal disease. Nevertheless, until recently gastro-enteritis provided a poor hunting ground for virologists for, although such viruses as adenoviruses, echoviruses and Coxsackie viruses could be isolated from the stools of patients with acute gastro-enteritis, they could often be recovered with almost equal frequency from those without diarrhoeal disease, particularly in developing countries. However, the examination of negatively stained faecal preparations from patients witb gastro-enteritis by electron microscopy has resulted in the discovery of many viruses, some of which, for example, rotaviruses and such parovirus-like viruses as the Norwalk agent, are undoubtedly the cause of acute gastroenteritis. The role of such other viruses as astroviruses, calciviruses, adenoviruses and coronaviruses remains as yet to be clearly established. In general, in vitro cultivation of viruses causing gastroenteritis in humans is either not possible or extremely difficult and of little value for routine diagnostic purposes but, since they are often excreted in very high titres, they may be detected without difficulty by electron microscopic examination of faecal extracts,-Banatvala jE: Viruses and Diarrhoes, Trans R Soc Trop Med Hyg 73: 503, 1979.
