These challenges include looming resource scarcities of equipment, personnel, and blood. In addition, there are the substantial infection risks to patients, family members and staff. These factors necessitate thoughtful but often difficult decisions on how to best triage patients with CHD. Our relatively small workforce adds another dimension to the challenge, since the rapid spread of COVID-19 could result in program closure at a moment's notice secondary to insufficient personnel from infection or quarantine. While many sectors of our society can be placed on hiatus during this period of crisis, our patients' diseases continue requiring care, particularly amongst newborns and infants who often require surgery during a narrow temporal window for satisfactory outcomes. Practitioners are tasked with optimizing care in the presence of the current and rapidly changing circumstances. While statements have been published relative to adults undergoing surgery, 1 guidance with respect to congenital heart disease patients is currently lacking and is the goal of this manuscript. As we have seen in other countries facing this pandemic, the thoughtful allocation of resources is paramount to the overall welfare of the community 2,3 and has led to such strategies in our country. 4, 5 The safety of our patients, healthcare providers, and our communities is our chief concern.",

To date, the biggest difficulties have not been COVID infections in CHD patients, which have been rare. The biggest threat to our patients is the sudden lack of resources, including the requisition of ORs (transformed into intensive care units), ventilators and healthcare providers for the fight against COVID. As a result, the surgical schedule must be culled to only the most urgent cases, which in our specialty is very difficult with many gray zones. Many factors pertaining to an individual case must be weighed, including: 1) resource-utilization, such as anticipated ventilator duration, intensive care unit stay, blood product usage, and other supplies that are or may become limited, 2) clinical status of the patient and risk of delaying surgery, 3) risk of exposure for the patient, family, and healthcare staff, and 4) co-morbidities and complexity of the procedure with implications on the usage of hospital resources, 5) in teaching hospitals, training may have to be curtailed and the most experienced surgeons used liberally, and 6) the safety of the patient's social and clinical situation if surgery is delayed. These decisions will often be made in the context of a hospital that is weighing the needs of other patients from different specialties with similar needs.",

            "text": "The timing of surgery is determined by a variety of factors -the clinical status of the patient, recommendations of the CDC, government officials, and professional societies (e.g., American College of Surgeons), and local hospital protocols. Importantly, this is a shared decision-making with the patient, family, and other specialists with transparency regarding the risks and benefits of proceeding with surgery versus waiting. The difficulty of this decisionmaking regarding timing is compounded by the realization that the duration of this pandemic and thus the delay for a given patient remains unknown. Table 1 is provided as general guidance regarding the timing of intervention for various diagnoses, depending on clinical status and other factors. It is not exhaustive and not meant to be a guideline, but highlights common conditions and scenarios. As stated earlier, this should be interpreted with flexibility depending on the current state of resources within a given institution and community. It is important to note that ongoing, close cooperation and communication between the surgical and medical teams is essential to ensure an accurate diagnosis and effective treatment strategy with the fewest resources and involved personnel. While in the setting of unrestricted resources certain conditions can be managed in a standard fashion, consideration during this time should be given to alternative approaches that may drain less resources and/or result in shorter hospitalization; e.g., a ductal stent may optimize resource utilization for a given institution as opposed to a surgical systemic-to-pulmonary artery shunt. Depending on the impact of this pandemic, there may be circumstances in the near future when it may not be appropriate or feasible to offer interventions to high-risk patients requiring high resource utilization with anticipated poor outcomes.",

In response, employing workplace strategies to reduce overall exposure, such as one-week on/one-week off rotation schedule for selected health-care providers, appropriate use of personal protection equipment (PPE), and downsizing of clinical teams and worksites, seems prudent. Vigilant surveillance for symptoms among team members is critical given the close proximity of congenital cardiac team members working together; one exposed or positive provider can put the entire team and program at risk because of quarantine requirements, resulting in a program being shut down because of insufficient staff to provide care. Precautions should also be taken for non-clinical support staff to minimize their exposure. Strategies of remote tele-working and rotational schedules should be applied to all staff when feasible.",

Differentiating who requires surgical evaluation for potential intervention during this time and who does not can be accomplished with a careful history, virtual visits, and review of diagnostic laboratory tests and imaging.

While each hospital strives to carefully monitor and appropriately care for COVID-19 patients, in-house patients and healthcare providers may be positive prior to symptom onset or knowledge of their status, putting incoming surgical patients and their families at risk. Furthermore, many of our patients' family members may be residing in group facilities, e.g., Ronald McDonald House, also placing them at risk for exposure. While the magnitude of such potential risk is unknown, it must be weighed against the urgency of the operation. COVID-19 has had the biggest clinical impact on older patients, especially those with predisposing conditions; however, younger patients without medical conditions are being affected and have also died. This finding is an important consideration since the congenital cardiac population often has underlying pathophysiological abnormalities and co-morbidities that place them at higher risk in the setting of a respiratory illness.",

Residents and fellows are frequently the frontline for many urgent in-patient emergencies, e.g., cardiac arrest in post-cardiac surgery patients, ECMO cannulation, placement of central venous or arterial monitoring lines, intubation, etc. They are also on a specific and very short timeline for acquiring surgical experience with case number and procedural requirements. However, this must be balanced with the risk of their exposure and well-being.",

The cumulative effect of these issues could result in a markedly reduced training experience, thus compromising their ability to fulfill certification metrics. Most congenital cardiac surgery residents have already completed 5-9 years of elite thoracic surgical training in order to spend 1-2 precious years of training at one of the few congenital residency programs in the country. While post-graduate medical and surgical education has been complemented by various remote or on-line learning modules over the last decade, the bulk of surgical learning continues to be centered in the operating room and ICU setting -this experience is essential and not replaceable with on-line education. While some flexibility during this crisis will be considered by the ACGME and ABTS, there may be circumstances where extension of the duration of training is needed; governing Boards and Program Director input will be necessary to ensure competence of the graduating trainee. In the meantime, efforts need to be made to minimize unnecessary exposure to infection, take appropriate precautions, and maximize all supplemental educational measures, e.g., video conferencing, virtual classrooms, etc., so trainees don't fall too far behind.",
