Substantive dose- and time-dependent neutrophil influxes have been observed in mice following intratracheal instillation and inhalation of CBNPs (Saber et al., 2009, Bourdon et al., 2012b, Jackson et al., 2012a, Saber et al., 2013, Kyjovska et al., 2015a). Generation of reactive oxygen species and induction of oxidatively damaged DNA has also been documented in cellular and acellular systems following exposure to CBNPs (Jacobsen et al., 2008). Increased oxidative DNA damage has been observed in mouse lungs following intratracheal instillation of CBNPs (Bourdon et al., 2012c); CBNPs have been shown to induce oxidative DNA damage, DNA strand breaks, and mutations both in vivo and in vitro, and in offspring following prenatal exposure (Driscoll et al., 1996, Saber et al., 2005, Jacobsen et al., 2008, Jacobsen et al., 2009, Saber et al., 2009, Jackson et al., 2012a). The mutation spectrum supports the notion that oxidative DNA damage as a result of CBNP-induced generation of reactive oxygen species may be the cause of this mutagenicity (Jacobsen et al., 2011). Furthermore, pulmonary exposure to CBNPs induces a pulmonary acute phase response in mice leading to alterations in cholesterol homeostasis (Bourdon et al., 2012a), which may increase the risk of cardiovascular effects (Saber et al., 2013, Saber et al., 2014).",

            "text": "In a previous study we showed that intratracheal instillation of 162 \u03bcg CBNPs (a dose corresponding to pulmonary deposition during nine 8-h working days at the current Danish occupational exposure limit for carbon black) resulted in increased neutrophil influx, changes in the expression of genes associated with inflammation, and genotoxicity in the lungs of C57BL/6 mice that lasted for 28 d following a single exposure (Bourdon et al., 2012a, Bourdon et al., 2012c). However, it remains unclear whether these inflammatory responses persist at time-points beyond 28 d, and how these inflammatory responses evolve over time. In this study, we investigate lung neutrophil influx, global gene expression changes, and genotoxicity at multiple post-exposure time-points following exposure to 162 \u03bcg CBNPs via intratracheal instillation. We used intratracheal instillation in order to have an exact time point following which to measure the onset of the pulmonary response to CBNP exposure to increase precision in measurement of temporal changes in gene expression. In addition, although inhalation is a more physiologically relevant exposure model, the generation of aerosol for the desired dose of nanomaterials is complex, expensive, time-consuming, and poses hazards to laboratory personnel (Brain et al., 1976). Moreover, inhalation methodologies require high concentrations of experimental dose and it can be difficult to deliver the desired dose to the experimental animal (Brain et al., 1976). Intratracheal instillation enables the delivery of the desired dose and provides a fairly uniform distribution of the experimental materials throughout the lungs of the exposed mice (Brain et al., 1976, Mikkelsen et al., 2011). Overall, our experiment examines the effects of CBNP exposure at early (3 h), intermediate (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 14 d), and late (42 d) time-points to understand the implications of CBNP exposure.",

Briefly, the primary particle size reported by the manufacturer was 14 nm. The estimated specific surface area was 295\u2013338 m2/g. The total carbon content was greater than 99%, with 0.82% nitrogen and 0.01% hydrogen by weight. The content of organic impurity was less than 1% and included very low levels of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (74.2 ng/g) and endotoxin (142 EU/g). The size distribution of CBNP particles suspended in Nanopure water determined by dynamic light scattering (DLS) has been reported previously to be dominated by agglomerates in the size range of 50\u2013100 nm (Jackson et al., 2012a, Jackson et al., 2012b, Kyjovska et al., 2015a).",

Total numbers of neutrophils, macrophages, eosinophils, lymphocytes, and epithelial cells were counted in BAL fluid. Significant increases in neutrophil number were observed at all post-exposure time-points and persisted until 42 d post-exposure, with the largest influx observed 1 d post-exposure (Table 1\n). The net increase in total BAL cells in exposed mice relative to the controls was mainly due to large influxes of neutrophils. Thus, the inflammatory response in the lungs was predominantly driven by neutrophils. However, we observed significantly increased counts of macrophages on 4, 5, and 42 d; lymphocytes on 4 and 14 d; epithelial cells after 3 h, and eosinophils on 4 d (Table 1). Successful pulmonary deposition of CBNPs was confirmed by the presence of particles observed by light microscopy at all assessed post-exposure days (data not shown). The amount of free particles decreased over time; however, macrophages containing black particles were present at all post-exposure time-points for all CBNP exposed mice (data not shown). Additionally, protein content in BAL fluid was determined as a marker of cell membrane integrity; significant increases in protein level were observed in CBNP exposed mice compared to vehicle controls at all time-points except 3 h and 14 d (Fig. S1).",

Beyond 5 d, the number of enriched immune-responsive pathways then began to increase again, and many enriched pathways were found 42 d post-exposure (Fig. 6\n). Perturbation of these pathways is consistent with our GO analysis and further strengthens the argument of induction of a biphasic inflammatory response following CBNP exposure (Fig. 6). Additionally, we observed enrichment of pathways related to apoptosis and survival, cell adhesion, and development at 3 h post-exposure; pathways related to cell cycle were perturbed 2 and 3 d post-exposure, whereas two pathways related to DNA damage were perturbed only 2 d post-exposure (Fig. 5). Pathway data were also suggestive of a possible interruption of cell cycle and DNA damage at intermediate (2 and 3 d) post-exposure time-points.",

The inflammatory response following intratracheal instillation of CBNPs was dominated by neutrophils, and gene expression analysis revealed substantive immune, inflammatory, and acute phase responses, as well as pathways signaling oxidative stress and DNA damage that persisted up to 28 d following exposure of mice to 162 \u03bcg CBNPs. The results of these studies (Bourdon et al., 2012a, Bourdon et al., 2012c) suggested significant changes in the pulmonary response over time and especially in the intermediate time window (within 3 d). In the present study we provide more detailed insight into the temporal sequence of pulmonary gene expression changes that occur following CBNP exposure and the persistence of these effects. The use of intratracheal instillation allowed the delivery of one bolus dose for resolution of a highly time-dependent pulmonary response. We demonstrate significant changes in the pulmonary response over time, with major events occurring immediately post-exposure (3 h), but with some molecular changes persisting up to 42 d post-exposure following a single intratracheal instillation. Our findings support immediate early initiation of oxidative stress, DNA damage, and apoptosis following CBNP exposure, leading to changes in cellular division/replication, consistent with mounting an inflammatory response, and prolonged inflammation to 42 d post-exposure. We observed a biphasic response in gene expression changes, but not BAL cell counts, which was also observed to a lesser extent in our previous investigations (Saber et al., 2006, Bourdon et al., 2012a). Our exposure (162 \u03bcg CBNPs/mouse) is equivalent to the cumulative dose expected in nine 8-h working days at the current Danish occupational exposure limit based on observed particle size distribution during aerosolization of CBNPs (Jackson et al., 2012a). A recent study on workers exposed to CBNPs reported exposure levels of 14.90 mg/m3 in the inhalation zone (Zhang et al., 2014); the dose used in the present study corresponds roughly to the pulmonary deposition during two 8-h working days at 15 mg/m3.",

Inflammatory BAL cell count showed that neutrophil infiltration was initiated as soon as 3 h post-exposure and remained elevated until 42 d post-exposure. Elevation in neutrophil count was accompanied by an increase in macrophage counts on 4, 5, and 42 d in the CBNP exposed mice, with the highest numbers observed 42 d post-exposure; furthermore, a brief surge in lymphocytes was observed 4 and 14 d post-exposure. Our gene expression, GO, and pathway data showed significant enrichment of acute phase response, and several immune-inflammatory GO processes and pathways at early and late time-points that suggest the presence of a biphasic inflammatory response that was initiated almost immediately following CBNP exposure. We observed significant up-regulation of genes associated with chemokines and their receptors, cytokines and their receptors, complement factors, acute phase genes, TNF superfamily members, and other pro-inflammatory genes (e.g., Csf2, Orm2 (Orosomucoid 2), Timp1, Nfkbia, Vnn1, Vnn3) at multiple post-exposure time-points. Serum amyloid A (Saa1, Saa2, and Saa3), macrophage inflammatory protein-2 (Mip-2, also known as Cxcl2), interleukin-6 (Il-6), and macrophages/monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (Mcp-1, also known as Ccl2) are biomarkers of chemotactic recruitment of inflammatory cells including neutrophils and induction of inflammation following CBNP exposure (Jacobsen et al., 2009, Saber et al., 2014). In a previous study, Jacobsen et al. (2009) reported significant up-regulation of Il6, Mip-2 (Cxcl2), and Mcp-1 (Ccl2) 3 h and 1 d post-intratracheal instillation of CBNPs in ApoE\u2212/\u2212 and C57BL/6 mice. In this study, we observed significant up-regulation of Il6 (4.4 fold; p < 0.0001) at 3 h, Cxcl2 (2.0 fold; p < 0.005) at 1 d, and Ccl2 at 3 h (3.3 fold; p < 0.0001) and 1 d (2.0 fold; p < 0.05) post-exposure. Additionally, significant up-regulation of Ccl2 was observed 2 d (3.0 fold; p < 0.001), 3 d (2.0 fold; p < 0.05), 14 d (2.0 fold; p < 0.01), and 42 d (2.0 fold; p < 0.01) post-exposure. Increased expression of several neutrophil chemoattractants (e.g., Saa1, Saa3, Il6 and Ccl2) in our study is in agreement with the previous study, and may explain the recruitment and presence of pro-inflammatory cells in the lung of CBNP exposed mice.",

Tissue injury following excessive neutrophil activation is well documented in major organs including the respiratory, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, and musculoskeletal systems, among which the respiratory system is the most susceptible, and may lead to the development of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, or cystic fibrosis (Tintinger et al., 2005). The acute phase response, which is shown to occur here after pulmonary exposure to different types of particles and nanomaterials (Bourdon et al., 2012a, Saber et al., 2013, Saber et al., 2014, Kyjovska et al., 2015a, Kyjovska et al., 2015b), is the likely cause of this intense neutrophil recruitment and is implicated in health effects that extend beyond the respiratory system, such as adverse cardiovascular effects including systemic inflammation and alterations in cholesterol homeostasis, and increased plaque progression (Mikkelsen et al., 2011, Bourdon et al., 2012a, Saber et al., 2013, Saber et al., 2014, Poulsen et al., 2015). We note that increased levels of acute phase proteins including SAA are associated with risk of cardiovascular disease in prospective epidemiological studies (Ridker et al., 2000). Thus, the data from our study and from previous work suggest long-term systemic complications following CBNP exposure.",

            "text": "Chronic inflammation can occur when there is an incomplete resolution of acute inflammation caused by excessive tissue damage or particles that cannot be removed from the lungs. The major cells involved in this process are macrophages and lymphocytes (Moldoveanu et al., 2009). Alveolar macrophages are the resident macrophages in the alveoli that account for 95% of the macrophage population and provide protection against pathogens and exogenous materials by phagocytosis; however, prolonged surges in macrophages are indicative of loss of pulmonary homeostasis and may be implicated in multiple chronic pulmonary diseases including asthma and chronic COPD (Moldoveanu et al., 2009, Scherbart et al., 2011, Duan et al., 2012). We observed a significant surge in macrophage counts starting from 4 d post-exposure and continuing until 42 d in our study, and elevation of lymphocyte counts 14 d post-exposure, which are in agreement with established mechanisms for chronic inflammation (Moldoveanu et al., 2009). A number of previous studies have suggested that exposure to nanoparticles results in internalization and deposition of the particles deeper into the lung tissue that may induce prolonged inflammatory response. Results from a recent study by Zhang et al. (2014) on workers exposed to carbon black, which was validated by a mouse model study, showed that CBNPs are deposited in lung tissue following inhalation exposure and may contribute to long-term inflammation and lung diseases (Zhang et al., 2014). In another study using nano-scale hyperspectral microscope, intratracheally instilled titanium dioxide nanoparticles (nano-TiO2) were shown to evade particle clearing mechanisms and deposit in the lung, thus inducing long-lasting pulmonary inflammation and translocation of nanoparticles to the blood, heart, and liver (Husain et al., 2013, Husain et al., 2015). In fact, it has been established in several studies that nanosized particles are not readily recognized by macrophages, and thus their clearance is hampered (Ferin et al., 1992, Katsnelson et al., 2010). This may lead to accumulation of CBNPs within the lung, sustained inflammation, development of granulomas, tissue damage, and eventually pulmonary disease (Heinrich et al., 1995, Driscoll et al., 1996, Bermudez et al., 2002, Bermudez et al., 2004, Carter et al., 2006). At the later time-points in this study, we observed black matter in macrophages, but there was no evidence of free particles in the BAL fluid, which indicates that CBNPs were likely engulfed by macrophages at these time-points (data not shown). However, we did not quantify CBNP retention in the lungs. In previous studies we assessed lung burden following inhalation exposure to 42 mg/m3 of nano-TiO2 (primary size 21 nm) for 1 h daily for 11 days, which resulted in a similar estimated pulmonary deposited dose as the present study (Hougaard et al., 2010, Hougaard et al., 2011). Five days following exposure, 24% of the estimated deposited dose was still present in the lungs, indicating some particle clearance; whereas, 21% of the estimated deposited dose was still present 26\u201327 d post-exposure, indicating prolonged pulmonary particle retention (Hougaard et al., 2010, Hougaard et al., 2011). The prolonged particle retention was accompanied by increased neutrophil influx at 26\u201327 d post-exposure (Hougaard et al., 2010, Hougaard et al., 2011).",

Functional analysis of gene expression changes revealed that inflammation-associated gene expression changes were resolved by 3 d post-exposure, with little to no inflammatory response 4 d post-exposure observed by gene expression profiling despite the BAL cell counts showing significant increases in neutrophil, macrophages, eosinophils, and lymphocyte numbers. Inflammatory gene expression increased again at later time-points (e.g., 14 and 42 d post-exposure). Genes affected 4 d post-exposure were mainly involved in muscle regulatory processes; several muscle contraction and regulation related GO processes and pathways were perturbed at this time-point, which indicate a possible change in the smooth muscle regulatory process in the lungs. CBNPs are known to affect lung structure and can cause destruction of lung tissue. In a study on Balb/c mice that were exposed to 30 to 50 nm carbon black particles by inhalation, Zhang et al. (2014) reported histopathological changes in the lungs of exposed mice. Seven and 14 d following exposure, these authors observed thickening of the alveolar wall, disarrangement, and swelling of some cells with vacuolar degeneration in the experimental groups compared to the control groups (Zhang et al., 2014). Our GO and pathway data from the 4 d post-exposure time-point indicate similar changes that may lead to cytoskeleton remodeling and alteration in the alveolar architecture.",

            "text": "Exposure to CBNPs is known to cause oxidative stress and cell death, which is supported by a number of in vitro studies (Hussain et al., 2010, Reisetter et al., 2011) and is evident from gene expression profiles at the earliest time-point in the present study. Cell death may occur in several ways (e.g., necrosis, apoptosis, and pyroptosis). Apoptosis plays an important role in many cellular processes, and is mainly characterized by the shrinking of cells (Hussain et al., 2010, Reisetter et al., 2011). Decreased mitochondrial membrane potential, increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and DNA strand breaks have been implicated in CBNP-induced apoptosis (Hussain et al., 2010). Although apoptosis is necessary for controlling inflammation and clearing inflammatory cells, brief or incomplete apoptosis, which could occur due to abnormal functioning of inducer or suppressor genes, may lead to prolonged infiltration of inflammatory cells in the lungs and may play a central role in various chronic lung inflammatory conditions, including asthma and acute respiratory distress syndrome (Moldoveanu et al., 2009, Hussain et al., 2010, Reisetter et al., 2011). Pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., GM\u2013CSF) may be responsible for delaying the process of apoptosis (Moldoveanu et al., 2009). Exposure to CBNPs causes an inflammasome-dependent form of cell death known as pyroptosis in macrophages (Reisetter et al., 2011). Pyroptosis shares characteristics with both necrosis and apoptosis; however, inflammatory in nature and unlike apoptosis, it causes swelling of cells by fluid influx that leads to loss of membrane integrity and results in the release of inflammatory contents of the damaged cells (Reisetter et al., 2011). Interestingly, our GO and pathway analysis indicates significant enrichment of oxidative stress, cell proliferation, and apoptosis regulatory processes mainly at the 3 h post-exposure time-point. Differential expression of numerous genes, including several mitochondrial genes, were consistent with this: Thioredoxin interacting protein (Txnip), Glutamate\u2013cysteine ligase, catalytic subunit (Gclc), Hypoxia inducible factor 1, alpha subunit (Hif1a), Uncoupling protein 3 (mitochondrial, proton carrier) (Ucp3), Uncoupling protein 2 (mitochondrial, proton carrier) (Ucp2), Prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (Ptgs2), Clusterin (Clu), Isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (NADP +) soluble (Idh1), Thioredoxin reductase 1 (Txnrd1), Cytoglobin (Cygb), Tyrosine aminotransferase (Tat), and Sulfiredoxin 1 homolog (Srxn1). We also observed transcriptional changes in several pro-inflammatory genes (colony stimulating factor 2, granulocyte-macrophage) and pro-apoptotic genes (Casp3, Casp4, and Casp8). Therefore, it is reasonable to argue that our gene expression data provide evidence of oxidative stress, cell death, and imbalance of systemic homeostasis in the lungs of C57BL/6 mice following this single exposure to CBNPs that resulted in the observed prolonged pulmonary inflammation.",

            "text": "CBNP exposure is known to cause DNA damage. In our previous studies, increased DNA strand breaks were observed in the lungs of C57BL/6 mice following 0.7, 2, 6, 18, 54, and 162 \u03bcg CBNP exposure at various time-points relative to control lungs; although we consistently observed 50\u2013100% increases in %TDNA, no dose\u2013response relationship was observed (Bourdon et al., 2012c, Kyjovska et al., 2015a). In this study, we found significantly increased levels of DNA strand breaks in BAL cells after 3 h, and in lung tissues 2\u20135 d post-exposure. Interestingly, we also observed increased levels of DNA strand breaks in liver tissue 3 h post-exposure; this phenomenon could be due to translocation of CBNPs from the lungs to other secondary organs. We recently reported translocation of low levels of nano-TiO2 from the lungs to the blood, heart, and liver 24 h after the exposure (Husain et al., 2015); such observations support the possibility of translocation of CBNPs from lung to liver. Alternatively, DNA damage in the liver could result from circulating second messengers (e.g., acute phase proteins, cytokines, and chemokines) that were differentially expressed in the lungs at those respective time-points (Jackson et al., 2012a).",

Gene expression data in the present study suggest that CBNP exposure induces oxidative stress and causes DNA strand breaks at the early post-exposure time-points, which may then lead to inhibition of cell growth relatively early after the exposure in the lungs of C57BL/6 mice. CBNP-induced gene expression profiles were highly correlated with expression profiles derived from tissues and cell culture models treated with a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (CDKI), cigarette smoke, formaldehyde, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF\u03b1), in particular from cultured epithelial cells and ApoE\u2212/\u2212 mouse tissues (Thomson et al., 2013) (Table S6). Several networks and pathways, including pulmonary inflammation, cell cycle arrest, necroptosis, apoptosis, and DNA damage that were perturbed in response to CDKI, cigarette smoke, and formaldehyde exposure have been identified (Thomson et al., 2013). The high similarity of our expression profiles with these published data supports the notion that CBNP exposure may induce long-term detrimental effects in the pulmonary system, similar to effects caused by smoke or formaldehyde inhalation.",

            "text": "The biphasic nature of the response that we observed suggests that the possible consequences of CBNP pulmonary exposure are multifold. The first level of response is an acute inflammatory response, driven by neutrophil influx and acute phase responses, which is immediately followed by the induction of oxidative stress, DNA strand breaks, cell cycle arrest, and cell death (apoptosis, necrosis, and pyroptosis). These immediate responses in the initial post-exposure days may then facilitate the worsening of pulmonary homeostasis (Fig. 8\n). We speculate that all of these dysfunctions modulate the development of a secondary inflammatory response at the later time-points, which may ultimately lead to multiple chronic pulmonary inflammatory processes. Thus, the results support a pivotal transitional time period around 4\u20135 d post-exposure, during which there is a shift between the immediate responses, and sustained effects resulting from particle retention and pathological changes. Instillation or aspiration of a single dose in toxicological studies is considered more economic and safer alternatives to 28 or 90-day inhalation studies. Our time series study suggests that the biological responses following pulmonary particle exposures evolve over time, and can be effectively tracked using single-exposure study designs. During the continuous exposures, the transcriptional responses will likely be a mixture of these time-dependent responses. The present time-series study suggests that for early time-points, the transcriptional responses following exposure to a single dose will likely differ significantly from those observed following continuous exposures, whereas the long-term responses are more likely to be similar, since the transcriptional responses at 14 and 42 d following a single exposure were somewhat similar (Fig. 5, Fig. 6).",

Overall, the results provide a thorough description of the inflammatory, DNA damaging, and transcriptional events that occur over post-CBNP exposure times. The data clearly demonstrate a biphasic response in gene expression changes, and persistence of these effects up to 42 d post-exposure in the lungs of C57BL/6 mice. The results of the current study on female mice agree well with previously published data on inflammation performed only in male mice (Zhang et al., 2014). The experimental design used addresses the need for temporal data to produce adverse outcome pathways linking diverse molecular perturbations to pulmonary diseases driven by sustained inflammation.",
