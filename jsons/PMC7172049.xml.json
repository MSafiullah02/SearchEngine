            "text": "The respiratory and the intestinal tract are entry sites that are used frequently by microorganisms to invade a host. In both cases, epithelial cells lining the lumen are a primary target site for successful infection. The intestinal epithelium comprises a variety of cell types that have differentiated into specialized cells to fulfill different functions, e.g. enterocytes, goblet cells, M cells, and others. In addition, non-epithelial cells, such as intraepithelial lymphocytes are present within the epithelial layer. There are no immortalized cell lines that reflect all the functions of well-differentiated epithelial cells. Primary cells are a more promising culture system to analyze the characteristics of these cells. Cultures of primary intestinal epithelial cells are difficult to prepare and often have a limited time of viability that is not sufficient for infection experiments (Bjerknes and Cheng, 1981, Cano-Gauci et al., 1993, Lotz et al., 2006). For physiological studies, the Ussing chamber has proven to be a valuable device to measure the flow of ions across the epithelium (He et al., 2013). The large volume and the constant exchange of the solutions applied, render this system not practicable for infection experiments. Furthermore, the cells are functional only for a limited time.",

Filter-grown airway epithelial cells may differentiate into specialized cells such as ciliated cells or mucus-producing cells, when maintained under air-liquid-interface (ALI) conditions (Slepushkin et al., 2001). This system has been used for human cells and cells from other species (Goris et al., 2009). An alternative culture system for differentiated respiratory epithelial cells is provided by precision-cut lung slices (PCLS), where the epithelial cells are maintained in their original setting (Fisher et al., 1994, AbdEl Rahman et al., 2010, Meng et al., 2013). In addition to mucus production and ciliary activity, this culture system provides an additional feature of the airway, bronchoconstriction (Martin et al., 1996). As submucosal cells are also present in precision-cut lung slices, they can be included in the investigation (Goris et al., 2009, Punyadarsaniya et al., 2011).",

After having closed one end of the intestine with the help of a thread, the intestine was filled gently with low-melting-point agarose (agarose LM GQT; GERBU, Gaiberg, Germany) to stabilize the intestinal tissue. For solidification, the sample was put on ice. The samples were arranged in a straight position about 1 cm in length and \u2013 after removal of the thread by cutting \u2013 5 pieces of intestine were put into the cool tissue holding adapter of a Krumdieck tissue slicer (TSE systems, Bad Homburg, Germany, model MD4000-01). The space between the intestine and the walls of the adapter were filled with low-melting-point agarose. After solidification, the intestine was cut with the Krumdieck tissue slicer into slices approximately 250 \u03bcm thick with a cycle speed of 60 slices/min. Precision-cut intestinal slices were incubated in 1 ml of RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen/Gibco, Darmstadt, Germany) containing antibiotics and antimycotics; Amphotericin B 2.5 mg/l (Sigma-Aldrich, Munich, Germany), Clotrimazole 1 mg/l (Sigma-Aldrich, Munich, Germany), Enrofloxacin 10 mg/l (Baytril\u00ae, Bayer, Leverkusen, Germany), Kanamycin 50 mg/l (Roth, Karlsruh, Germany), Penicillin 0.06 g/l (Sigma-Aldrich, Munich, Germany), Streptomycin 0.05 g/l (Sigma-Aldrich, Munich, Germany) per slice in a 24-well plate at 37 \u00b0C and 5% CO2. The medium was changed every hour during the first 2 h and once after 24 h to remove the agarose before slices were used for infection. The integrity of the cells in precision-cut intestinal slices was determined by applying a Live/Dead viability/cytotoxicity assay kit (Fluo Probes, Rockford, USA, FP-BE4710). For this purpose, the slices were washed with PBS and incubated with calcein AM (1 \u03bcM) and ethidium bromide (EthD-1; 2 \u03bcM) for 30 min. The former compound is converted into a green-fluorescent dye which is retained by intact cells. Ethidium bromide stains the DNA of cells which have lost the plasma membrane integrity. After incubation, slices were washed with PBS and embedded in Mowiol resin prior to analysis by a Leica TCS SP5 AOBS confocal laser scanning microscope using wavelengths of 488, 561, 405 (excitation) and 570,520, 421 nm (emission) for detection of the green fluorescence of FITC, the red fluorescence of Cy3, and the blue fluorescence of DAPI.",

Therefore, precision-cut intestinal slices were analyzed for the expression of sialic acids on the epithelial cells. Cryosections from precision-cut intestinal slices were stained with sialic acid-specific lectins: S. nigra agglutinin (SNA) and M. amurensis agglutinin (MAA) typeII. The former lectin recognizes \u03b12,6-linked sialic acids, the latter \u03b12,3-linked sialic acids. As shown in Fig. 2A, the cells stained by the two lectins have a different distribution. Cells stained by SNA (green) were found predominantly in subepithelial regions. This result suggests that \u03b12,6-linked sialic acids are more prominent at the lamina propria that consists of connective tissue. Cells visualized by MAA staining (red) were readily detectable along the epithelial cells lining the intestinal lumen. This finding indicates that \u03b12,3-linked sialic acids are present on the luminal surface of the epithelium. Pretreatment of precision-cut intestinal slices by neuraminidase from C. perfringens abolished lectin-specific staining (compare Fig. 2A and B) indicating that binding of both MAAII and SNA was sialic acid-dependent.",

            "text": "In this study, a culture system for chicken intestinal epithelial cells was introduced that is suitable for infection studies. In previous reports, different approaches have been applied to analyze the infection of intestinal epithelial cells (IEC). In contrast to respiratory epithelial cells, IEC cultures are more difficult to establish. Thus, the culture systems introduced so far have all some shortcomings, e.g. a short life span, or the selection of only some specialized cells such as crypt cells (Bjerknes and Cheng, 1981, Cano-Gauci et al., 1993, Lotz et al., 2006). Precision-cut intestinal slices are an interesting alternative as their preparation is comparably easy providing a large number of slices. Furthermore, the epithelial cells lining the intestinal lumen remain viable for up to 4 days, a life span long enough for virus infections. The feasibility of this approach has been demonstrated with the avian influenza virus of the H9N2 subtype. While influenza virus infections in many cases are restricted to the respiratory tract, infection of Mallard duck by influenza viruses is a typical lower intestinal infection (Fran\u00e7a et al., 2012). Therefore, it will be interesting to use precision-cut intestinal slices from duck intestines for infection studies. In this study, the infection system was established for the chicken intestine, because the chicken is used routinely in the laboratory tests, e.g. for preparation of chicken embryo kidney cells. Future work will include the preparation of precision-cut intestinal slices from other avian species. The preparation method for precision-cut intestinal slices reported in this study is limited by the organ size. It is expected that this technique can also be applied to the intestinal tissue from small mammalian species e.g. from mice and bats. Thus, precision-cut intestinal slices promise to be a valuable culture system for infection studies with enteric viruses.",
