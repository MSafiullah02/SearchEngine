In this edition of Disease A Month, among the mosquito borne illnesses we will discuss, dengue will be covered in depth, with updates and an overview of other important similarly transmitted infections that clinicians will want to become more aware of, such as Zika, malaria, and Chikungunya virus (CHIKV). Although significant media attention, and public health efforts were given to Zika, especially during the recent Olympics in Brazil, CHIKV continues to express a wide geographic distribution,18 has resulted in over 2.5 million cases, and is well established in the Americas. Although the number of Yellow Fever cases is declining, the virus continues to cause human illness, in spite of vaccines. Of concern, vectors (mosquitoes) capable of spreading these and other illnesses can survive and thrive in North America, including many states within the United States, as will be discussed in this edition of Disease-a-Month.",

One of the interesting aspects of VBI is the fact that if someone is infected with a pathogen that is heretofore not present in a region, but has a mosquito or similar vector that is capable of contracting and spreading that pathogen, the potential exists for small amounts of individuals to introduce a disease into a region previously na\u00efve to that infection.",

Because of our location, significant public health resources and medical infrastructure, along with wide spread immunizations against a broad array of pathogens, the United States (US) has been fortunately isolated from many infectious diseases, that typically cause much suffering for other regions of the globe, with the notable exception of tuberculosis (TB), HIV/AIDS, Lyme, West Nile, pneumonia, and influenza related illness, as well as hospital acquired infections. That notwithstanding, for a large proportion of the planet, infectious diseases remain the leading causes of death, disability, in some cases preventable blindness25, 26 and other serious sequellae. But with widespread travel \u2013 nearly a billion people travelled through airports and other transportation hubs \u2013 along with dramatic growth in imported agriculture and other products, land and sea borders no longer provide the significant protections they once did, and North America now faces the potential for a resurgence in infections.
