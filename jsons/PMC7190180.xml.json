This differs substantially from other studies where late\u2010onset candidemia occurred in <1% of blood stream infections with no documented cases in 1400 renal transplants over a 2\u2010year period (18, 19). The reasons for this difference are unexplained. Although the epidemiology of late\u2010onset candidemia is not well defined, the development of candidemia in SOT recipients in our study may be a marker of severe underlying illness, as 12 of the 13 late\u2010onset episodes were hospital inpatients at the time of diagnosis and had multiple risk factors for candidemia. These risk factors included receipt of broad\u2010spectrum antibiotics for concurrent bacterial infections, ongoing immunosuppression, and indwelling medical devices such as urinary catheters and vascular access devices. It is not surprising that most cases of late\u2010onset candidemia occurred in renal transplant recipients, as this is the most common type of transplant performed and is generally associated with the longest survival times (20). Although we found predisposing factors for candidemia in SOT recipients to be similar to those in non\u2010SOT patients (with the exception of corticosteroid use), studies of large numbers of patients with SOT are required to identify specific risk factors for this group of individuals, especially in those with late\u2010onset candidemia.",

Surprisingly, mortality rates were similar to non\u2010SOT patients, despite the increased use of corticosteroids in the SOT group (Table 2), which has been documented as an independent factor for all\u2010cause mortality in candidemia (12). However, compared with non\u2010SOT patients, SOT recipients were more likely to die within the first 5 days of candidemia diagnosis. This may reflect a higher burden of disease in SOT recipients, contributed to by a poor inflammatory response leading to a lack of classic clinical and radiological signs of candidal infection (1). Thus, delays in the commencement of therapeutic antifungal agents result in rapid progression of infection. All these factors are further compounded by a reliance on a relatively insensitive \u2018gold standard\u2019 test (i.e., blood cultures) (23). These issues may be addressed in the future with non\u2010culture\u2010based diagnostic methods, although their sensitivity and specificity are highly variable and not well evaluated in SOT recipients (24, 25).",

Such breakthrough infections include non\u2010albicans Candida species, which have been associated with higher attributable mortality rates compared with C. albicans infections (27). In our study, azole antifungal prophylaxis was not associated with selection of non\u2010albicans Candida species in SOT recipients or increased mortality.

However, associations did not change after the exclusion of HSCT recipients (17 allogeneic and 11 autologous HSCT patients) from the non\u2010SOT group (data not shown).
