Initially, YHLV was proposed to be a baculovirus due to its size and enveloped rod-shaped appearance (Chantanachookin, Boonyaratpalin, Kasornchandra, Direkbusarakom, Ekpanithanpong, Supamataya, Sriurairatana & Flegel 1993) . However, upon the discovery that the genome consisted of ssRNA, it was reported that the virus was either a rhabdovirus or a coronavirus (Wongteerasupaya, Sriurairatana, Vickers, Akrajamorn, Boonsaeng, Panyim, Tassanakajon, Withyachumnarnkul & Flegel 1995) . Loh, Tapay, Lu and Nadala (1997) reported the genome as negative in polarity, resulting in the virus being clas-si\u00a2ed as Rhabdoviridae. However, it was subsequently reported that YHLV was a plus-strand RNA virus via in situ hybridization and sequence analysis (Tang & Lightner 1999 ). These latest results placed YHLV into the corona-like viruses. In 2000, Cowley, Dimmock, Spann & Walker (2000a) stated that the YHLV genome contains an open reading frame (ORF) 1a polyprotein containing a 3C-like Cys protease, an ORF1b coding sequence with replicase functions including an SDD polyprotein, and a helicase domain, an e\u2044-cient^one ribosomal frameshift site at the ORF1a/ 1b overlap that facilitates translation of a 759 kDa ORF1ab polyprotein. From this, it was concluded that the YHLV was a unique member of the Nidovirales. The YHLV have subsequently been placed as members of a new genus Okavirus of a new family Roniviridae, within the order Nidovirales (Mayo 2002) . There are two other families within the order Nidovirales.

Lu et al.

TheYHLV was \u00a2rst described inThailand in1990 by Limsuwan (Chantanachookin et al. 1993 ).

The results indicated that the level of YHLV in wild P. monodon was generally low. However, high levels of YHLV were detected in moribund male broodstock reared in captivity for more than 12 months. The RT-nPCR products from spermatophores in these prawns were also signi\u00a2cantly greater than those ampli\u00a2ed from the lymphoid organ, which had previously been identi\u00a2ed as the primary site of YHLV replication in chronically infected P. monodon (Spann et al. 1995) . It was also reported that in one out of three spermatophores examined by TEM, mature YHLV virions were detected in the seminal \u00a3uid but not in the sperm cells. The RT-nPCR for YHLV in eggs were positive; however, nauplii and protozoea were generally negative. This implies that YHLV is associated with the egg surface and the majority of the virus is lost when the nauplii hatch and that the infection levels in the protozoea remain low. argued that this could be due to the lack of development of the lymphoid organ in larval and early postlarval life stages, which is likely to limit potential infection levels. Reverse transcription nested polymerase chain reaction has detected YHLV in PL 5 to PL 15 both from hatcheries and experimental spawnings of P. mono-don , suggesting that viral replication in postlarvae is occurring at su\u2044cient levels to be detected . reported that the identi\u00a2cation of lymphoid organ spheroid bodies and YHLV particles in $ 1.2 g juvenile P. monodon grown from hatchery stocks (PL 6 and PL 20 ) suggests that at least some of the postlarvae were infected with YHLV. However, as individual postlarvae were not grown in isolation, it strongly raises the distinct possibility that some juvenile infections occurred during the course of the grow-out through cannibalism or water-borne transmission. Clearly, this horizontal transmission could promote translocation of YHLV and the potential infection of wild P. monodon in the vicinity of farms via water or through the escape of infected farmed prawns. The authors concluded that the high prevalence of chronic YHLV infection in P. monodon broodstock from northeastern Queensland and farmed prawns produced from these broodstock promotes the idea that this is perpetuated primarily by vertical transmission both in the wild and in hatcheries. Unfortunately, however, in that paper, the authors failed to comment on the likely survival of the YHLV-infected progeny. They only tested eggs and nauplii.

However, at the time of the pathogenicity trial, there were at least \u00a2ve concomitant viruses infecting Australian P. monodon. These viruses consisted of monodon baculovirus (MBV) (Doubrovsky, Paynter, Sambhi, Atherton & Lester 1988) , lymphoid parvo-like virus (LPV) (Owens, De Beer & Smith 1991) , infectious hypodermal and haematopoietic necrosis virus (IHHNV) (Owens, Anderson, Kenway, Trott & Benzie 1992) , spawner-isolated mortality virus (SMV) (Fraser & Owens 1996) and Mourilyan virus (MoV) (Cowley, McCulloch, Spann, Cadogan & Walker 2005) , which all could have possibly in\u00a3uenced the mortality of the P. monodon in this trial. This infection trial was repeated in 2004 by Vega et al. In that study, the prawns were again inoculated with \u00a2ltered prawn homogenate containing levels of YHLV (not puri\u00a2ed virus). They reported that 100% (15/15) of the YHLV-injected prawns died compared with 40% (2/5) of the controls.While there was a sig-ni\u00a2cant increase (P 5 0.010) in YHLV for both the infected prawns and the controls during the trial, the YHLV increase was signi\u00a2cantly higher (P 5 0.047) in theYHLV-injected prawns than the control prawns. Again, no other viruses were tested for in that study or referred to as potential pathogens. There are many papers that report YHLV to be pathogenic. However, there is no substantial evidence to support this. Currently, there is only an association with disease.

However, penaeid prawns with severe WSSV exhibit the same marked lymphoid organ necrosis (Pantoja & Lightner 2003) . The method of injecting YHLV-infected crude homogenate of prawn tissue to determine pathogenicity gives no information as to the virulence of that virus to a species of prawn with respect to our current knowledge of possible multiple viral infections within the same prawn or homogenate sample. To demonstrate a direct pathogenic e\u00a1ect of YHLV, either pathogen-free stock would be required or a viable penaeid cell line would be needed with puri\u00a2ed viable YHLV.

However, this does not demonstrate that they can be naturally infected. For more substantial results, the prawns should have been infected via bath inoculum or fed infected carcasses. This would give a stronger indication as to whether the three species of prawns are naturally susceptible to YHLV infection because the viral agent would not be bypassing the primary defences of the prawn, i.e. the cuticle or gut. This di\u00a1erence in susceptibility by either experimental or natural pathways is demonstrated by Lu et al. (1994) . This research demonstrated that an intra-muscular injection of YHLV into P. vannamei resulted in100% mortality, despite the fact that P. vannamei now being the dominant species cultured in Asia, there has been no disease report due toYHLV where YHLV is highly enzootic in this region. Other possible reasons for this phenomenon are that YHLV may have mutated from its highly pathogenic variant; multiple viruses are involved in the disease expression or biosecurity and speci\u00a2c pathogen-free stocks may be limiting the chance of infection. However,YHLV is still causing disease in P. monodon within this region and other viruses including the Taura syndrome virus and WSSV still cause disease losses in P. vannamei in this region, resulting in the most probable reason for YHLV not causing disease in P. vannamei even though there is a high chance of infection being the low susceptibility demonstrated by P. vannamei. there is also the possibility that the intra- Figure 7 Transmission electron microscopy of vesicles within nerve cells of the fasciculated zone of the eye of moribund Penaeus monodon.

The RT-PCR was able to amplify as little as 0.01pg of YHLV-RNA and showed evidence of infection in P. monodon at 6^12 h after experimental exposure to the virus. However, it is more likely that the RT-PCR detected the YHLV genome that was injected into the prawn and circulated in the haemolymph, than it was to be detecting infection at such an early time after injection. In 2000, Cowley et al. (2000b) developed an RT-nPCR for the detection of YHLV within Australia. The speci\u00a2c genome ampli\u00a2cation with the one-step PCR is able to detect 0.01pg cDNA while using the two-step PCR technique 0.01fg cDNA was detectable. The YHLV genome could be detected within 6 h of experimental infection of a P. japonicus. However, again it is probable that the test was detecting genome that was injected into the prawns and does not necessarily indicate viral replication. Gill biopsies can be used as a tissue sample (Cowley et al. 2000b) or more recently, it has been reported that dried haemolymph can be used for the detection of YHLV with RT-PCR (Kiatpathomchai, Jitrapakdee, Panyim & Boonsaeng 2004) , resulting in the ability to sample broodstock.

These diagnostic methods are sensitive and speci\u00a2c for the detection of viruses; however, they require special equipment/reagents and highly trained personnel, which result in expensive assays and thus a limited number of samples being tested, which mitigates widespread stock assessment in developing countries. This precipitates an enhanced spread of disease and increased mortalities on the farm primarily due to unknown viral infection or viral load of the prawns being produced or grown in hatcheries and farms. It is inconceivable to ignore the necessity of cheaper detection methods such as the antibodybased tests or HA assays that need to be available for on-farm application, allowing farmers to detect the presence of the virus and the loading of the virus in their farm stock/broodstock. As mentioned previously, when a viral epidemic occurs, one virus is usually assigned as the aetiological agent. This is because either only the most probable virus was tested for or, alternatively, if other viruses were detected but were in low numbers, then they are usually ignored, with the virus in the greatest abundance designated as the disease-causing agent. With the high level of prawn viral infection throughout the world, contemporaneous reports appear to ignore the potentially profound e\u00a1ects of dual infection of viruses in prawns with regards to disease. Unquestionably, for a greater understanding of how prawn viruses are interacting with each other to cause disease, there is a requirement for further re-search to infect prawns with individual viruses drawing comparison with prawns dually infected with known viruses. This would enable farmers to predict adequately the likelihood of the occurrence of disease outbreak. For example, it has been reported previously that YHLV infection is present in approximately 97% of P. monodon in Australia. It would be advantageous to determine the e\u00a1ect of dual infection of SMV, MBV, IHHNV, MoV, etc. in the same prawns to ascertain the likelihood occurrence of disease and what mixture of viruses results in disease expression.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conclusion"}, {"text": "The process by which viruses cause disease is not yet understood as not all prawns with a speci\u00a2c virus will exhibit disease symptoms or su\u00a1er mortality.

There are many possible triggers for diseases to appear, including external factors such as environmental stress (i.e. poor water quality).
