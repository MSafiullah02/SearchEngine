            "text": "This review article examines the evidence behind the potential use of these leading drug candidates for the treatment of COVID-19. The authors conclude, based on this review, that there is still no high-quality evidence to support any of these proposed drug therapies. The authors, therefore, encourage the enrollment of eligible patients to multiple ongoing clinical trials that assess the efficacy and safety of these candidate therapies. Until the results of controlled trials are available, none of the suggested therapeutics is clinically proven as an effective therapy for COVID-19. The infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 manifests as Coronavirus disease 2019 . The majority of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 either remain asymptomatic or demonstrate mild symptoms and recover from their illness. The most common clinical presentation is pneumonia with symptoms of fever, dry cough, and shortness of breath. 3 Anosmia, dysgeusia, and diarrhea have been reported. 4 About 20-30% of patients require intensive care for respiratory support, and over 15% of patients with severe pneumonia develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (Figure   1 ). 5, 6 There is currently no proven drug for the treatment of COVID-19. The standard of care is supportive measure, aimed at managing fever, dehydration, and constitutional and other clinical symptoms. Because of the morbid and potentially fatal nature of COVID-19, there have been efforts to repurpose other clinically available drugs based upon antiviral activities that have either been demonstrated in vitro or proposed due to the agents' mechanism of action. Novel and experimental drugs with potential antiviral properties are also being considered. Finally, therapies that modulate the hyperinflammatory response of the host are being investigated (Table) . Antiviral drugs are believed to be useful early in the course of the disease when it is mediated by active viral replication. Immunomodulating agents are generally being evaluated for use during the later pro-inflammatory process, usually manifesting as clinical deterioration in the second week after symptom onset.",

These properties have led to its use in inflammatory rheumatologic diseases. Various mechanisms have been proposed for its antiviral activity (Table) . Chloroquine can rapidly increase the endosomal pH, thereby reducing the fusion between SARS-CoV-2 and the endosome. By impairing terminal glycosylation of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), it decreases the affinity of SARS-CoV-2 with ACE2, which serves as its main entry point into the cell. patients remain positive for SARS-CoV-2 PCR on day 5-6 after treatment initiation. 13 In another study that is yet to be peer-reviewed, clinical improvement was observed in 25/31 (80.6%) of patients treated with hydroxychloroquine as compared to 17/31 (54.8%) in the control group that received standard treatment (including antivirals other than hydroxychloroquine). 14 Collectively, the suggestion of clinical benefit for the use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine for SARS-CoV-2 should be interpreted with caution, as it is supported only by limited, and often times conflicting, clinical data.",

            "text": "Favipiravir is a non-nucleoside RNA polymerase inhibitor that was developed for the treatment of influenza. It has also been tested against Ebola, Marburg, Nipah, Lassa fever and Zika viruses. [44] [45] [46] Favipiravir was used alone or in combination with monoclonal antibodies as post-exposure prophylaxis for Ebola in at least five healthcare workers. 47 Its use, in combination with ribavirin, potentiated its effect in vitro. 46, 48 There is very limited published in vitro and clinical data on the use of favipiravir in coronavirus infections. In a study that was previously shared prior to peer-review but has since been temporarily removed, favipiravir and lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) were compared in an open-label study of 80 patients during the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in China. 15 When compared to LPV/r, favipiravir was associated with shorter time to viral clearance (median 4 versus 11 days, p<0.001) and significant improvement in chest imaging (improvement rate 91.43% versus 62.22%, p=0.004). Additionally, the Japanese Health Ministry commented that the use of favipiravir in 70-80 patients did not produce similar clinical benefit. 49 These contrasting findings call for a randomized controlled trial to assess the safety and efficacy of favipiravir for the treatment of COVID-19 (Table) . although it showed weak antiviral activity. 50 In a subsequent study of 41 patients who received LPV/r or standard of care, there was a significant difference in the incidence of ARDS or mortality at day 21 (LPV/r = 2.4% versus control = 28.8%, p<0.001). A multivariate analysis showed that lack of LPV/r use was independently associated with worse outcomes. Notably, ribavirin was used concurrently with LPV/r because of its known broad-spectrum antiviral activity and possibly an indirect immunomodulatory demonstrated that combination of arbidol with LPV/r was significantly better than LPV/r alone for nasopharyngeal swab PCR conversion to negative after seven days (75% versus 35%, p<0.05), after 14 days (94% versus 52.9%, p<0.05) and improvement on CT chest (69% versus 29%, p<0.05). 22 However, in a randomized controlled open-label study, LPV/r combination was not significantly better than the standard of care for the management of severe COVID-19. 21 This randomized controlled trial has some noteworthy limitations. First, the mortality rate was high, which suggests the enrolment of patients with severe COVID-19. Second, the median time from symptom onset to randomization was 13 days, which suggests the drug may have been given too late, when viral replication may no longer be the major factor. Notably, a total of 42% of patients remained positive at day 28, raising the concern about its antiviral efficacy. An absolute difference of 6.8% in 28-day mortality was observed, but this did not reach statistical significance. Collectively, the data on the use of LPV/r for the treatment of COVID-19 is very limited. Larger controlled clinical studies are needed to evaluate the role of LPV/r (potentially in combination with ribavirin) in COVID-19 (Table) .",

Thus, the collaboration of the healthcare community to engage patients for participation in clinical trials is essential.

Second, there are numerous clinical trials that are aimed to determine if curbing the proinflammatory state produced during COVID-19 with drugs such as IL-6 inhibitors (e.g., sarilumab or tocilizumab) or anti-GM-CSF compounds (e.g., lenzilumab and gimsilumab) will lead to better clinical outcomes by preventing or reversing ARDS and multi-organ failure.",

As of April 16, 2020, the virus has infected over 2,090,000 people worldwide, resulting in over 139,000 deaths. 1 Initially called novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), it was officially named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) because of its similarities with the agent that caused severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003. 2 Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (MERS) and SARS-CoV-2 belong to the Genus betacoronavirus and are agents of respiratory infections in humans.",

Similarly, after showing a promising in vitro effect, chloroquine failed to reduce the duration of dengue viremia and nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) antigenemia. 34 Moreover, chloroquine did not improve acute disease and was associated with more chronic arthralgia in patients with chikungunya infection. 35, 36 Assessing its activity against SARS-CoV-2, Wang et al. demonstrated, in in vitro studies on Vero cells, that chloroquine affected the entry and post-entry stages of infection. 7 They suggested that a daily dose of 500 mg of chloroquine would achieve the half-maximal effective concentration (EC 50 ) in clinical scenarios. Subsequently, Gao et al. reported their preliminary finding on the use of chloroquine in 100 patients in Wuhan, China, which concluded that chloroquine prevented exacerbation of pneumonia, improved findings on lung imaging, and shortened the course of the disease. 10 However, the full, peer-reviewed publication of this clinical trial is not available. Due to a shortage of chloroquine and a superior safety profile, hydroxychloroquine has been proposed as an alternative for the treatment of COVID-19. Yao et al. compared the EC 50 for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine and found that hydroxychloroquine was more potent (EC 50 of 0.72 \u03bcM) than chloroquine (EC 50 of 5.47 \u03bcM). 8 However, in a subsequent analysis, Liu et al. found chloroquine to demonstrate a lower EC 50 across four different multiplicities of infection. 37 The antiviral effects of hydroxychloroquine were tested in a small open-label non-randomized trial by Gautret et al. 11 In this study, viral eradication was faster in hydroxychloroquine group compared to untreated control group, and this finding was further magnified in 6 patients who received azithromycin for prevention of bacterial infection. However, there are major limitations of the study that raises caution in the interpretation of the results. Indeed, the International Society of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy released a statement that the study does not meet the Society's expected standards. 38 Only 20 of 26 patients treated with hydroxychloroquine were included in the final analysis. The SARS-CoV-2 PCR cycle threshold (which is inversely related to the viral load) was higher in patients treated with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin combination (therefore, they have lower viral load and expected to clear sooner). The majority of the patients treated with hydroxychloroquine had milder disease (only 22% patients had lower respiratory tract infection). The comparator group was from a different hospital that may have different clinical practices. 39 A follow-up to this study by the same authors reported the promising clinical and virologic outcomes of 80 patients managed with the combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin. While the authors confirmed the efficacy of this combination therapy, this single-arm observational report lacks an all-important control group, thereby limiting the strength of their conclusion. 12 Molina et al. also investigated the use of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin and reported that 8 of 10 (80%)",

However, in the rescue-therapy group of 31 patients, LPV/r was given at a median of 18 days after symptom onset (when patients had been off ribavirin). No statistical difference was seen between LPV/r and control group (n=343) in mortality, intubation rate, and steroid use. These observations suggest that the efficacy of LPV/r may be best achieved when it is given early in the course of coronavirus infection. The MERS outbreak reignited interest in the anti-coronavirus activity of LPV/r. In vitro data and animal model showed therapeutic potential in human MERS infection. 53-55 A clinical trial (MIRACLE) is ongoing to evaluate the efficacy of LPV/r in combination with IFN-\u03b2. 56 Because of the anecdotal clinical data from the previous coronavirus outbreaks, LPV/r has been used for the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in China and has been part of the Chinese national guidelines. 57 Reports of use in individual cases or series are available;however, it is difficult to critically appraise the data because of concomitant use of Chinese herbal and other therapies.[16][17][18][19]58 In a retrospective cohort study, Deng et al.",

However, peer-reviewed clinical data for remdesivir use in COVID-19 is still not available. In vitro data shows that remdesivir has potent activity against SARS-CoV-2 infected Vero cells. 7 Remdesivir had higher selectivity index (ratio of half-cytotoxic concentration [CC 50 ] and EC 50 ) when compared to ribavirin, penciclovir, favipiravir, nafamostat and nitazoxanide (>129.87 and >88.50 versus >3.65, >4.17, >6.46, >4.44, >16.76, respectively). Holshue et al. reported the first successful use of remdesivir, given on a compassionate basis, in a 35-year-old US man with COVID-19. 23 Midgley et al. further reported that 3 of the first 12 cases of COVID-19 in the US received compassionate use remdesivir. 24 The three patients received remdesivir for 4-10 days, which resulted in improvement in respiratory symptoms.
