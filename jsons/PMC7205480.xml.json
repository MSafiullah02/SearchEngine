There are few specific requirements which need to be discussed pre-op during this pandemic with the patient and the relatives, in order to avoid any unnecessary medicolegal issues. We have devised the first pro forma of informed consent of such patients undergoing surgical intervention.",

In a retrospective cohort study of 34 operative patients with confirmed COVID-19, 44.1% of patients required ICU care in the post-operative period and mortality rate was 20.5% [1]. Therefore, it is very important to devise a separate informed consent for operative patients during COVID-19, taking all the risk under consideration. We are reporting the first ever informed consent pro forma especially designed for COVID-19 patients undergoing surgery.",

There are also concerns about the lack of pre-op COVID testing in India due to paucity of commercial testing kits. A normal patient may develop or contract corona virus infection in the peri- or post-operative period which should be again documented in the consent form. Hence, a detailed modified consent form was designed exclusively for all patients who require surgery during this pandemic.",
