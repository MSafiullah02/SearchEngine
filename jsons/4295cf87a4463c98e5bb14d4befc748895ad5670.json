This apparent sterility is maintained by numerous interrelated components of the lung physical structures such as the mucociliary elevator and components of the innate and adaptive immune systems (discussed below) (reviewed in (Diamond et al., 2000; Gerritsen, 2000) ). However, it is possible that the observed sterility might be a result of the laboratory practices applied to study the flora of the lungs. Historically, researchers faced with a set of diseases characterized by a changing and largely cryptic lung microbiome have lacked tools to study lung ecology as a whole and have concentrated on familiar, cultivatable candidate pathogens. With the availability of new technologies for cultivation-independent analysis of microbial populations, it is now possible to follow individuals by sampling their lung microbiome sequentially during episodes of disease and recovery in order to identify associations between the lung microbiome and health and disease.",

It is likely, given the multiple microorganisms already implicated in chronic lung diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) , that there are other undetected organisms and that there are complex relationships between multiple pathogens involved that are not currently understood. A few studies have examined microbial species in limited numbers of normal subjects and patients with various respiratory disorders. One study using 16S rDNA clone libraries and microarrays did not detect any bacteria in the lungs of patients without respiratory disease who were briefly intubated for surgery (Flanagan et al., 2007) . The same study reported that all patients intubated for longer periods had detectable 16S rDNA and that the bacterial diversity present decreased during antibiotic usage. Another study used 16S rDNA amplification to identify bacterial species in 16 patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia (Bahrani-Mougeot et al., 2007) . This study identified bacterial pathogens not seen using conventional culture techniques, especially anaerobes, and found that oral bacteria could be detected in the lung. In one study, sputum samples from 25 cystic fibrosis (CF) patients were analyzed using 16S gene profiling and the authors identified an average of 7.2 species present per subject (Bittar et al., 2008) . Viruses have also been examined in nasal lavages in both asthmatic and normal subjects with cold symptoms using the Virochip microarray (Kistler et al., 2007) . The microarray technology identified more viruses than conventional culture methods and had excellent sensitivity and specificity compared with pathogen-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR). An unexpected diversity of human coronavirus and rhinovirus strains was discovered in the subjects.",

The lungs themselves are divided into different sections according to their function and structures: the bronchi, bronchioles, and alveoli. Bronchi and bronchioles are primarily conductive airways surrounded by thick cartilage that allow easy airflow into the parenchyma (or alveolar tissue) of the lungs, where gas exchange occurs. Conductive airways are covered in ciliated epithelium interspersed with different types of secretory cells that release mucins, immunomodulatory proteins, surfactants, and proteases. Together, the physical and chemical barriers protect against physical and biological damage by establishing a mucociliary elevator, which brings about an upward transport of a mucus stream for the lungs (Fraser, 2005) . The secretory cells decrease in proportion from 20 to 30% in the trachea to less than 1% in the distal and alveolar parts of the lungs. In addition to the physicochemical protection provided by cilia and mucus, the epithelium is also protected by several immune cells, including dendritic, Langerhans, T lymphocytes, and mast cells, that respond to inhaled antigens establishing a robust immunity (Fraser, 2005) . It is thought that in conjunction with the physical barriers provided by the nose and upper respiratory mucosa, these defenses are enough to maintain sterility in the lower respiratory tract.",

It is estimated that 87% of the total volume of the lungs is alveolar, with only 6% of this being tissue and the remainder gas (Stone et al., 1992) . The primary role of this tissue is to carry out gas exchange. The epithelium is mostly a continuous single layer of cells overlying a thin interstitium, which contains numerous capillaries that supply ample blood for gas exchange (Fraser, 2005; Stone et al., 1992) . Unlike the epithelium in the conducting airways, the respiratory epithelium is not ciliated or protected by mucus. Instead, it is covered by surfactant proteins that maintain the surface tension for efficient gas exchange. The lack of mucus or secretory cells is compensated by the presence of alveolar macrophages, mast cells, lymphocytes, dendritic cells, and other monocyte-like cells that protect the epithelium from potential pathogens and help maintain sterility.",

In 2006, 124, 500 people died in the US due to chronic lower respiratory disease (www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/deaths.htm). Chronic respiratory diseases include: asthma, COPD, CF, and bronchiectasis. These diseases generally lead to impaired clearance and function of the mucociliary elevator and/or the immune protection of the lung. In addition, immune deficiency such as that caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) also disrupts the typical immune homeostasis in the lungs. Without the normal protective barriers, the lungs fall victim to persistent and severe colonization that can ultimately lead to death, particularly for CF patients. As discussed below, the lung microbiome in each of these diseases is very different from normal individuals. The data discussed in the following sections demonstrate a clear link between microbial colonization and severity of disease symptoms. It is unclear, however, what exact role these different microbial populations play in initiating and enhancing the progress of such chronic respiratory diseases. Lastly, in some cases, the data hint that some population structures might actually be protective against further decline, but much more research needs to be conducted in this area to make a definitive claim.",

BAL is the most common procedure for sampling the lower respiratory system microbial colonization/infection status, to sample the components of the epithelial lining fluid, and to determine the protein composition of the airways. It is often used in evaluating the patient's lung immunological status by sampling cells and pathogen levels. BAL is an invasive procedure and thus is less ideal for research purposes.",

The sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of bacterial 16S rRNA derived from microbiome samples has been the primary method used to investigate bacterial diversity in the human body (Bik et al., 2006; Dekio et al., 2005; Eckburg et al., 2005; Gao et al., 2007; Hugenholtz et al., 1998; Hyman et al., 2005; Zhang et al., 2006) .

Controls were subjects briefly intubated for elective surgery. Bacteria were not detected by either method in samples from the controls. Sequencing from the clone libraries detected the presence of many orally, nasally, and gastrointestinal associated bacteria including known pathogens. The Phylochip detected the same organisms and many additional bacterial groups present at low abundance. Following antibiotic therapy, the bacterial populations' diversity decreased and was dominated by a single respiratory pathogen. In six of the seven patients, the dominant species was P. aeruginosa in spite of targeting this organism with antibiotics to which it was reportedly sensitive. The authors hypothesize that the loss of population diversity may directly contribute to pathogenicity, persistence, and development of pneumonia.",

The applications of shotgun techniques to the study of the human microbiome (Kurokawa et al., 2007; Manichanh et al., 2006; Zhang et al., 2006) again highlight the extent of microbial diversity associated with the human body while revealing much more of the identity and biology of nonculturable microorganisms. As a result of reduced costs and improved sequencing technologies, it is possible to perform in-depth metagenomic surveys of the human body's microbial diversity beyond the 16S rRNA surveys. Metagenomics, a term introduced in 1998, describes the functional and sequence-based analysis of total microbial genomes from environmental samples (Handelsman et al., 1998) . Metagenomics uses techniques that resemble the \"Whole Genome Shotgun\" approach of single genome sequencing, but it is not limited to a single species.",

Symptoms include dyspnea, coughing, wheezing, airway hyper-reactivity, chronic eosinophilic atopy, and mucus hyper secretion (Busse and Lemanske, 2001) . About 20 million people in the US have been diagnosed with asthma; 9 million of them are children. Asthma causes 4,000 deaths per year in the US and 11 million exacerbations. Asthma is caused by environmental and genetic factors (Martinez, 2007) , with asthma attacks resulting from immune responses to inhaled allergens. The majority of asthma exacerbations are caused by viral infections (Krishnan et al., 2006) . Atypical bacterial infections have also been associated with asthma exacerbations and with chronic asthma (Johnston and Martin, 2005; Martin et al., 2001) . In susceptible individuals, the development of asthma has been associated with bacterial colonization in neonates (Bisgaard et al., 2007) and viral and bacterial infections (Wu and Chu, 2009 ). There is abundant evidence testifying to the importance of microbes to the development and maintenance of asthma. A recent publication using a bacterial gene sequencing method suggests a disordered microbiome in asthmatic airways (Hilty et al., 2010) .",

Asthma is known to be caused by environmental and genetic factors (Martinez, 2007) . These factors determine asthma severity and how easily it can be treated (Martinez, 2007) . Many associations with asthma have been detected including exposure to cigarette smoke (Thomson et al., 2004) , caesarean section birth relative to natural birth (Thavagnanam et al., 2008) , early viral respiratory infections (Gold and Wright, 2005; Harju et al., 2006) , early in life antibiotic use (Marra et al., 2006) , and living in the US (Gold and Wright, 2005) . One theory for the cause of the increase in asthma incidence is the hygiene hypothesis (Strachan, 1989) , that the rise in prevalence of asthma is a direct consequence of the success of modern hygienic practices in preventing childhood infections. This hypothesis is supported by numerous studies that have shown that children coming from a less hygienic environment have less asthma and other allergenic diseases (Ball et al., 2000; Celedon et al., 1999; Jarvis et al., 1997) . In addition, alterations in innate immune system genes have been shown to be associated with the inception and development of asthma. These genes include the toll-like receptors and other genes such as MBL, MYLK, DEFB1, JUN, INF-\u03b15, and NOS2A reviewed in Wu and Chu (2009) .",

They are also associated with hospitalization for asthma in adults (Venarske et al., 2006) . A separate study revealed that patients with allergic asthma infected with RV had increased admissions to hospitals and that dust mite allergen was the primary allergen when these patients were skin tested with a panel of aeroallergens (Green et al., 2002) . Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in infants causes lower respiratory infection leading to pneumonia and bronchiolitis. RSV bronchiolitis is the leading cause of wheezing in infants and young children, and children infected with RSV resulting in bronchiolitis are more likely to develop wheezing and asthma later in childhood (Peebles, 2004) . Similarly, the human metapneumovirus (hMPV) was first isolated from children in 2001 and has been found to be associated with asthma exacerbations in both children under 5 years of age and adults (Foulongne et al., 2006; Williams et al., 2004) .",

Infections by these bacteria have been shown to be associated with asthma exacerbations (Johnston and Martin, 2005; Lieberman et al., 2003; Martin et al., 2001) . Using a PCR assay, 31 of 55 patients with asthma were positive for either of these bacteria in lung tissue or BAL, suggesting that some level of colonization by these bacteria may be common in asthma patients (Martin et al., 2001) . Studies in a mouse model suggest that preexisting allergic inflammation impairs the ability to upregulate TLR-2 and IL-6 in the lungs, leading to decreased clearance of M. pneumoniae and an increase in airway inflammation (Kraft et al., 2008) .",

            "text": "Evidence is accumulating that infections are associated with the induction and development of asthma. First, long-term cohort studies on the development of asthma show that most childhood asthma begins in infancy. The first episode of wheezing begins before the age of 3 and is frequently associated with lower respiratory tract viral infections, usually RSV, but also RV (Gern et al., 2000; Sigurs et al., 2005) . These infectious episodes and associated wheezing are strong predictors for the development of childhood asthma and atopy (Devulapalli et al., 2008; Kusel et al., 2007; Martinez et al., 1995; Singh et al., 2007) . Second, many studies have associated viral infections with asthma prevalence in children (Devulapalli et al., 2008; Jackson et al., 2008; Kusel et al., 2007; Papadopoulos and Kalobatsou, 2007; Sigurs et al., 2005; Singh et al., 2007; Williams et al., 2004) . Lastly, Wu et al. have provided evidence to suggest that viral infections have a causal role in asthma initiation and development where they show that viral infection during the first 4 months of age is strongly correlated with the development of asthma by age 5 (Wu et al., 2008) . Only one-third of children with childhood wheezing and asthma, however, will develop persistent asthma symptoms in adulthood (Gerritsen, 2002; Taylor et al., 2005; Vonk et al., 2004) . Management of the symptoms with corticosteroid therapy is effective but may not alter the asthma progression (Guilbert et al., 2006) .",

This observation has raised questions about the relationships among asthma severity, fungal sensitization, and fungal exposure. The issue is complicated by more than 1.5 million species of fungi that are thought to exist (Hawksworth and Rossman, 1997 ) and more than 80 species of fungi that have been associated with symptoms of airway allergy (Horner et al., 1995) . For one species, A. fumigatus, 20 allergens are thought to participate in human airway allergies (www.allergome.org). Determining the clinical relevance of fungal allergens is confounded further by extensive cross-reactivity among fungal allergens (Crameri et al., 2009) .",

It is a severe autosomal recessive disease with an incidence of 1:2000 at birth in populations of northwestern European origin, with a mutant gene carrier frequency of 1:23 in these populations. The genetic defect occurs in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR) protein, which acts to transport chloride across cell membranes. Patients with CF are the archetype population with chronic bronchial colonization. Symptoms include permanent bacterial colonization of the lower airways, with a formation of a biofilm, fat maldigestion, male infertility, and elevated levels of chloride in the sweat (Knowles and Durie, 2002) . The thick pulmonary system mucus in CF patients minimizes the effectiveness of the mucociliary elevator in clearing the lung of mucus-trapped microorganisms and other debris. As a consequence, microbes chronically colonize these patients' lungs and they suffer bouts of infection, requiring frequent hospital admission. Cultures reveal a wide range of bacteria, including P. aeruginosa, Mycobacteria, A. fumigatus, and sometimes viruses.",

The complexity of this ecosystem is difficult to overstate. As an example of this complexity, the lungs of CF patients contain large numbers of neutrophils that migrate to this location in response to microbial colonization. These neutrophils secrete granule antimicrobial proteins called defensins that kill microbes. By analysis of CF sputum samples, the levels of extracellular defensins are sufficiently abundant that they may damage the airway epithelium (Soong et al., 1997) . As another example of this inter-specific complexity, P. aeruginosa in CF lungs produces copious amounts of a tricyclic compound pyocyanin that kills competing microbes and eukaryotic cells. This compound was shown to specifically inactivate a human lung epithelial cell line vacuolar ATPase (Ran et al., 2003) .",

The findings of this analysis were that, for CF subjects, a single rRNA type was dominantly represented in the clone libraries prepared from lung microbiome genomic DNA. This was not found in the controls. Thirteen of the CF subjects' samples contained bacteria not routinely assessed by culture. Candidate pathogens were identified in four CF subjects.

However, recent observations suggest a link between the lower airway microbial flora and host disease characteristics. For example, the prevalence of idiopathic bronchiectasis associated with nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) appears to be increasing (Billinger et al., 2009; Marras et al., 2007) . Both familial clustering and a characteristic \"tall asthenic\" phenotype (scoliosis, pectus excavatum, mitral valve abnormalities) in postmenopausal women with bronchiectasis associated with NTM infection (Colombo et al., 2009; Kim et al., 2008) have been reported. It is unknown whether the age, female sex, and unique body morphotype associations are seen in idiopathic bronchiectasis unassociated with NTM. Correlating disease phenotype with microbial flora is dependent upon accurately categorizing the microbial status of the patients. For environmental organisms like NTM, it is important that this categorization include both accurate speciation and determination that the organism likely represents true infection rather than contamination or transient colonization. The American Thoracic Society and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (ATS/IDSA) microbiologic diagnostic criteria for pulmonary disease based on sputum specimens call for at least two positive sputum specimens for the same species (Kim et al., 2008) .",

A recent study in CF patients found that A. fumigatus, like NTM, was commonly present in older patients: 75% of patients aged 16-20 years and in 60% of patients over age 20 (Valenza et al., 2008) . Amin and colleagues further noted that CF patients who were chronically infected with A. fumigatus (defined as two positive cultures in a given year) had significantly worse airway obstruction as evidenced by a lower forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1 ) and significantly higher risk of pulmonary exacerbations during subsequent follow-up than patients without A. fumigatus (Amin et al., 2009) . This potential negative impact on the course of bronchiectasis and a possible benefit from antifungal treatment for chronic infection in CF have prompted initiation of a multicenter clinical trial of itraconazole in CF patients in Canada (Amin et al., 2009; Shoseyov et al., 2006) . In non-CF bronchiectasis, a recent study suggested that Aspergillus is more common in patients infected with NTM than in those without NTM, and that it is commonly associated with fungal lung disease manifestations in NTM-infected patients (Kunst et al., 2006) . However, outside the relatively small numbers of idiopathic bronchiectasis patients with allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) or chronic necrotizing aspergillosis, the pathologic significance of these fungi has not been systematically explored in large numbers of patients and very few data are available for Aspergillus species other than fumigatus or filamentous fungi other than Aspergillus (Kobashi et al., 2006; Kunst et al., 2006; Raju et al., 2008) .",

The diagnostic criteria rely on an elevated total IgE as well as elevated A. fumigatus-specific IgE and IgG in the setting of episodic bronchial obstruction, pulmonary infiltrates, and central bronchiectasis. Kunst and colleagues assessed the prevalence of positive serologic markers for A. fumigatus [IgE by radioallergosorbent test (RAST) and precipitins] among idiopathic bronchiectasis patients and found these markers to be commonly present especially in the setting of concomitant NTM disease (Kunst et al., 2006) . Patients with these serologic markers more commonly had radiographic manifestations suggesting Aspergillus-associated disease. While other filamentous fungi such as Scedosporium species have been commonly recovered from the airways of both CF and non-CF bronchiectasis patients, the role these fungi play in disease pathogenesis remains controversial (Cooley et al., 2007) . While specific IgE antibody RAST and precipitin assays can be prepared using allergen prepared from the isolated species and correlated with the clinical presentation of allergic bronchopulmonary mycoses, these assays have not been commonly used to characterize the clinical significance of these fungal species recovered from the lower airway (Fedorova et al., 2008; Lake et al., 1991) .",

Despite efforts aimed at smoking cessation, little impact has been made on COPD incidence, and current treatments are ineffective in slowing progression of the disease. COPD has been defined by the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) as \"a disease state characterized by airflow limitation that is not fully reversible\". The diagnosis of COPD can also encompass those with chronic obstructive bronchiolitis and emphysema. Tissue inflammation in COPD is characterized by a predominant neutrophil, CD8+ lymphocyte, and macrophage infiltration (Keatings et al., 1996; Lacoste et al., 1993; O'Shaughnessy et al., 1997; Saetta et al., 1998) . It has been proposed that the mechanism of tissue damage involves the recruitment and activation of neutrophils, macrophages, and CD8+ T cells with concomitant upregulation of several cellular proteases and inflammatory cytokines.",

While smoking can stimulate inflammation in the lungs, smokers with COPD have an increased inflammatory response than smokers without COPD, and inflammation can persist despite smoking cessation (Keatings et al., 1996; Lacoste et al., 1993; O'Shaughnessy et al., 1997; Saetta et al., 1998) . These observations suggest that some other factor or factors contribute to development and perpetuation of the inflammatory response in COPD. Infection might be one such factor critical in triggering and perpetuating the inflammatory response in COPD. The mechanism by which infections might act to promote COPD progression has been termed the \"vicious circle\" hypothesis (Sethi, 2000a; Sethi and Murphy, 2008) . In this scenario, smoking causes structural remodeling that renders smokers more likely to become colonized and/or less able to clear subclinical infection. Defects in mucociliary clearance and surfactant abnormalities caused by smoking also contribute to the tendency to develop chronic infection (Finley and Ladman, 1972; Honda et al., 1996; Raju et al., 2008; Vastag et al., 1985; Verra et al., 1995) . Once colonization is established, the organism or organisms recruit white blood cells to the lungs, stimulating release of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines as well as proteases. Inability to clear the inciting organism perpetuates the cycle, ultimately resulting in tissue destruction, airway thickening, and clinical COPD.",

These pathogens can be found in patients with COPD in the stable state and during exacerbations (Sethi, 2004) . The colonization seen in patients with COPD is likely playing a role in disease and is not just an innocent bystander. For example, as bacterial load increases, FEV 1 falls, and colonization has been associated with greater sputum purulence, increased sputum neutrophils, and increased levels of interleukin (IL)-8, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)\u03b1, and neutrophil elastase (Obrian et al., 2007; Patel et al., 2002; Sethi, 2000b; Stockley et al., 2000) . Exacerbations associated with viruses are more severe and last longer than those without a viral trigger (Papi et al., 2006; Seemungal et al., 2001) . In addition, exacerbations associated with both bacteria and viruses may be more severe than those associated with single organisms (Obrian et al., 2007) , suggesting the usefulness of metagenomic techniques in this disease.",

Colonization with Pc is increased in HIV patients with COPD and correlates with disease severity (Morris et al., 2004b; Probst et al., 2000) . Animal models also support the role of Pc colonization in COPD. Christensen and colleagues recently reported that in immunocompetent mice, exposure to cigarette smoke and Pc colonization resulted in pulmonary function deficits and airspace enlargement characteristic of emphysema (Christensen et al., 2008) . In a model of Pc colonization in simian/human-immunodeficiency virus (SHIV)-infected nonhuman primates (Norris et al., 2006) , Pc-colonized animals developed airway obstruction and radiographic emphysema while animals infected with SHIV alone did not develop these changes (Shipley et al., 2010) .",

Diseases such as COPD, asthma, and bronchiectasis were reported to be increased in those with HIV before the introduction of antiretroviral therapy, and a similar decrease in these conditions as seen in the opportunistic infections has not occurred after antiretroviral treatment of HIV. In fact, in a recent study of HIV + patients, almost 4% of deaths were due to obstructive airway disease in 1998, a threefold increase from the pre-HAART era (Louie et al., 2002) . Before the HAART era, HIV + subjects were noted to have an accelerated form of emphysema with significant emphysematous disease seen in subjects less than 40 years old (Diaz et al., 1992 (Diaz et al., , 2000 . Both emphysema and airflow obstruction have been reported in HIV infection. Unlike many of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)defining opportunistic infections, HIV-associated COPD may actually be more common in the current era of HIV as it is frequently reported in those without a history of AIDS-related pulmonary complications and the now aging HIV + population has a longer exposure to smoking and HIV.",

The changes that occur in the lung microbiome have not been studied in HIV, but microbial colonization is a likely factor in the accelerated COPD seen in this population. The vicious circle hypothesis of COPD could be further worsened in HIV + patients by upregulation of HIV levels in the lung stimulated by pulmonary colonization. Several studies have shown that pulmonary infections increase lung levels of HIV. Koziel and colleagues reported that HIV RNA was detected in 62% of patients with active lung disease compared to 16% of asymptomatic subjects, independent of clinical stage of HIV and serum HIV RNA levels (Koziel et al., 1999) . The lung appears to be an independent compartment for HIV replication as drug mutations found in BAL differ from those in blood (White et al., 2004) . HIV in the lungs is associated with a lymphocytic alveolitis, particularly in those subjects with CD4 cell counts between 200 and 500 cells/\u03bcl, suggesting that the virus might act independently to stimulate pulmonary inflammation (Twigg et al., 1999) .

The lung microbiomes in each of these conditions has not been properly explored to date, which limits our ability to make definitive conclusions on how to best manage these diseases. Our understanding of the fundamental role of viruses in the initial establishment and progress of asthma underscores how little knowledge exists on the role of viral infection in other chronic respiratory diseases. In addition, the fact that some bacterial populations and/or components seem to be protective against further and severe exacerbations in asthma opens the door to questions about the role of microorganisms in protecting against other diseases. The exact nature of this protection is not clearly understood, and great benefit would come from studies that further clarify these intriguing results. Furthermore, if some population structures aid in preventing disease progression, it is likely that other population structures may predispose episodes of acute acerbations and progression of the underlying disease condition. A comprehensive understanding of the dynamics of these microbiome interactions would likely result in better, more efficient therapies for these and other respiratory diseases.",
