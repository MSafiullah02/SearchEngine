These three RNA viruses -SARS-CoV-1 (discovered in 2002), MERS-CoV (2012) , and SARS-CoV-2 (2019) -are much more virulent than the other four (HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1), which cause common colds and only rare cases of severe disease, including pneumonia. In 2002, SARS-CoV-1 caused an epidemic limited to China. In 2012, MERS-CoV caused an epidemic that began in Saudi Arabia, subsequently spreading primarily in the Middle East before containment. SARS-CoV-2 was first detected in China in 2019, but has since become a devastating ongoing global pandemic. Most SARS-CoV-2 infections are asymptomatic or benign, but SARS-CoV-2 infectious disease 2019 can cause life-threatening pneumonia. Severe COVID-19 occurs much more frequently in patients over the age of 50 years and/or with comorbid conditions such as pulmonary, cardiovascular, and metabolic disorders (Gabutti et al., 2020) (Figure 1) . Life-threatening disease probably strikes less than 1 in 1000 infected individuals below the age of 50 without underlying conditions but more than 1 in 10 infected patients over the age of 80 years with multiple comorbidities. The identification of advanced age and comorbidities as major risk factors is clinically important and suggests that the decline of the body weakens immunity, which may be difficult to translate into molecular, cellular, and immunological terms.",

With hindsight, this discovery told us more about the selective pressure imposed by malaria on the Homo sapiens genome than the mechanism by which individual human genomes predispose to malaria. It provided no significant explanation of malaria at the individual level, as it failed to explain why about 1 in 1000 infected children develops severe malaria, or 1 in 10,000 sickle cell trait carriers.",

The protein encoded by Mx, a gene cloned by cell complementation, protects mice from influenza virus (Staeheli et al., 1986) and is potentially relevant to COVID-19.

However, they remained largely neglected until 1996, when the first inborn error of immunity selectively underlying infectious disease segregating in families as a Mendelian trait was molecularly deciphered ( Table 1 ). The first and best studied of these conditions is Mendelian susceptibility to mycobacterial disease (MSMD), caused by inborn errors of type II interferon (IFN-\u03b3). Additionally, both Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and betahuman papillomaviruses (beta-HPV) are usually benign but can cause a lethal disease that is strictly Mendelian. Severe EBV-induced disease can be caused by inborn errors that disrupt the killing of EBV-infected B cells by cytotoxic T and NK cells. These deficiencies affect the collaboration between two major arms of adaptive immunity. By contrast, epidermodysplasia verruciformis results from disruption of the EVER-CIB1-dependent control of beta-HPV in keratinocytes, a deficiency of non-hematopoietic, cell-intrinsic immunity. Together with MSMD and two other fungal infections, these two disorders define the five known \"Mendelian infections\".",

This hypothesis has been confirmed by molecular genetic studies, beginning with viral diseases in 2007 (Zhang et al.) . The first and best example is that of herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) encephalitis, a sporadic disease caused, in ~5-10% of cases, by mutations affecting the TLR3 or snoRNA31 pathways (forebrain infection) or DBR1 (brainstem infection) (Zhang et al., 2018) . These mutations impair neuron-intrinsic immunity to HSV-1 in the central nervous Similar immunological scenarios, and even some of the same inborn errors, could underlie severe pulmonary COVID-19 in previously healthy young patients with monogenic disorders. In the absence of known human genetic determinants of susceptibility to other coronaviruses, influenza is likely to provide the best comparison. The threshold levels of type I and/or III IFN for protection against SARS-CoV-2 might be similar to those for the 1918 influenza virus, but higher than those for seasonal influenza. IFN-dependent control of the virus could be profoundly impaired during initial infection in patients with early-onset pneumonia, whereas those whose condition deteriorates later could have milder IFN deficiency, or genetically determined excessive inflammation. For example, IL18BP mutations underlie fulminant viral hepatitis because they unleash IL-18-dependent inflammation in the liver, whereas SH2D1A mutations underlie hemophagocytosis following B-cell infection with EBV. Inborn errors could impair IFN immunity in leukocytes or pulmonary cells or enhance local or systemic inflammation. It will be interesting to determine whether known inborn errors of inflammation, such as deficiencies of IL-1 or IL-6 immunity, protect against severe forms of COVID-19. Inborn errors of cell-intrinsic immunity in the CNS might be involved in the rarer neurological complications of COVID-19. The anosmia reported by some patients suggests that SARS-CoV-2 may infect the olfactory bulb, from which it may invade the forebrain, as for HSV-1 in patients with TLR3 mutations.",

The pathogenesis may be similar in these patients, with different causes converging on common pathophysiological mechanisms. For example, inborn errors of IFN-\u03b3 and IL-17A/F immunity underlie mycobacteriosis and candidiasis, respectively. The same infections occur in patients with autoantibodies against IFN-\u03b3 and IL-17A/F, and in patients infected with HIV who have low levels of IFN-\u03b3 and IL-17A/F production by CD4 + T cells, providing broader indications for the therapeutic use of IFN-\u03b3. Thus, monogenic cases may clarify pathogenesis more broadly for COVID-19 patients.",

Why would the spouse of a patient already ill for days and now in intensive care remain not only healthy but seronegative? How could a health care worker treating contagious COVID-19 patients with insufficient protection remain healthy and seronegative? If such individuals also test negative for T-cell responses to SARS-CoV-2, it is plausible that some are genetically resistant to the virus. The first example of such a situation was a regulatory DARC variant discovered in the 1970s and deciphered genetically in 1995. In the homozygous state, this variant confers resistance to Plamodium vivax by abolishing the expression of a parasite receptor on erythrocytes. Two other known monogenic forms of resistance are more directly relevant to COVID-19. Homozygosity for CCR5 null mutations protects against CCR5-tropic HIV, and homozygosity for null FUT2 alleles protects against intestinal norovirus infection. Similarly, we speculate that loss-offunction variants of ACE2, encoding a receptor for SARS-CoV-2, might confer resistance, while hypomorphic variants might protect against severe disease in infected individuals.",

We have all witnessed enormous interindividual clinical variability in response to SARS-CoV-2 exposure, ranging from resistance to death, and everything in between. Similar variability is observed for all human-tropic microbes, whether viruses, bacteria, fungi, or parasites. The proportion of life-threatening cases varies among microbes, from less than one in a million to greater than one in ten. This clinical variability during primary infection is the fundamental \"infection enigma\", which, in 1955, led Ren\u00e9 Dubos to pen \"Second thoughts on the germ theory\" (Dubos, 1955) . It is now time to test more comprehensively the hypothesis that the clinical manifestations of human infections, including SARS-CoV-2, can be governed by human genetics, at least in outliers resistant to infection or unusually prone to severe disease. This paradigm shift would open up new avenues for studying host-pathogen interactions in the course of evolution, controlling the current COVID-19 threat in the general population, and developing the infrastructure required to thwart future emerging threats. when infected. Severe cases (red) tend to occur in the elderly or in those patients having comorbidities. However, rare \"idiopathic\" severe cases can occur in the young without comorbidities, and these are hypothesized to represent patients with monogenic causes. A proportion of people remain asymptomatic (blue) when infected. In some instances, these may be people who remain resistant to infection (yellow), who can be identified by their remaining seronegative despite heavy or repeated exposures to the virus.
