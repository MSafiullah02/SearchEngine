In their study, Su and colleagues used modelling techniques from the Global Burden of Diseases study to generate comprehensive estimates of total tuberculosis spending from all sources across 135 low-income and middle-income countries between 2000 and 2017, allowing for comparisons across countries and over time. The authors estimate total spending for both notified and non-notified cases. These data can be helpful in understanding financial contributions from different sources including government, pre-paid private spending, out-of-pocket medical expenses, and development assistance for health funding, and in capturing the burden experienced by households and communities not typically captured by more traditional reports focused only on notified cases and government and donor spending. They also disaggregated spending estimates by function (eg, outpatient visits, pre-diagnosis visits, private drug spending).",

Total out-of-pocket spending decreased over the same period; however, although the authors captured direct out-of-pocket spending on medical expenses, they did not include non-medical costs including loss of income, transport, and indirect economic costs due to tuberculosis (many of which are now being collected through WHO patient cost surveys) in their analysis. The authors' findings show that three countries with strong private sectors\u2014Democratic Republic of the Congo, Nigeria, and Pakistan\u2014have out-of-pocket medical expenses as the primary source of tuberculosis spending.",

Notably, the authors present mean values weighted by population size or number of incident cases for the region, which is in line with the larger global burden of disease approach; however, such presentation requires careful interpretation. For instance, when looking at data for a specific country, the average total spend per incident case might be driven up by a few key countries in that region with large populations or numbers of incident cases, or both.",

Therefore, trends over time and across countries can be used to monitor fluctuations in total tuberculosis spending and assess needs across regions. This work also raises many important questions around reasons for changes in tuberculosis spending trends. Future work in this area should investigate reasons why tuberculosis spending levels have changed over time, with a particular focus on understanding decreasing costs in specific countries.",
