It also showed that, compared to \"no food,\" early enteral nutrition had an important influence on immediate unspecific cellular immunity and an activating effect on specific cellular immunity.

In this chapter the focus will be on critical illness in terms of surgical stress/ trauma after elective or acute surgery of the gastrointestinal tract and the postoperative conditions that might occur, e.g., sepsis. The innate immune response reacts immediately by creating a state of local inflammation at the site of injury. It activates macrophages, monocytes, complement, and the coagulation system. The reaction is amplified by the release, by monocytes, of proinflammatory mediators, such as the tumor necrosis factor (TNF), which initiate apoptosis; interleukin-1 (IL1) released by macrophages and monocytes initiates the migration of phagocytes and lymphocytes to the site of the inflammation and induces fever; thromboxanes, leukotrienes, and prostaglandins act on the coagulation of platelets and as paracrine or autocrine hormones in the inflammatory process. The adaptive immune response develops days after the innate immune response and involves the interaction between antigen-presenting cells and lymphocytes. This activates the cell-mediated immune response and the production of antibodies.",

It also helps with the detoxification of ammonia; it improves healing and restores the postoperative depression of the macrophage function. Arginine increases the circulating levels of NO and hence improves microcirculation. Immediately after a physical trauma, the level of arginine decreases.

The cells most frequently studied are CD4+, CD8+, NK, monocytes, CD19+, and the subgroups of all these cell lines. Some studies have found a significant increase in the cellular parameters after IED and some have found no significant changes. Some have shown a shift towards a Th1-dominated CD4+ population by reducing the number of Th2 cells when IEDs have been given. A meta-analysis (Zheng et al. 2007 ) of 13 relevant papers concluded that IEDs were safe and effective in reducing postoperative infection and the length of stay in hospital by increasing humoral and cellular immunity. Another meta-analysis (Mabvuure 2013) of 6 RCTs on patients undergoing esophagogastric resection concluded that, even though postoperative IED seems to improve humoral immunity, it does not reduce the rate of infections or the length of stay in hospital. It is not clear whether IEDs have a positive effect on cellular immunity. As stated above, the literature draws very contradictory conclusions. This is probably due to very heterogeneous patient populations, the different compositions of IEDs, and different ways of measuring the immunological markers. The results are therefore difficult to compare. A look at the different guidelines issued by the American, European, and Canadian societies for nutrition (CCPG, ASPEN, and ESPEN) shows that they too have contradictory opinions on IEDs. ESPEN and ASPEN recommend arginine in elective surgery, whereas CCPG does not find sufficient evidence of a beneficial effect. None of them recommend glutamine or omega-3 FA in elective surgery. When it comes to trauma patients, CCPG finds no benefit in arginine, whereas ASPEN and ESPEN find it beneficial. All three find glutamine beneficial or possibly beneficial. In patients with sepsis, none of the societies recommend glutamine or omega-3 FA, and all of them indicate potentially harmful effects when given arginine.

Despite a decrease in the number of lymphocytes in both groups, the number of lymphocytes in the nutrition group was significantly less than in the Significantly more cells than preoperatively \"no food\" group, showing that nutrition already had an impact on the number of lymphocytes on POD 3. Something similar occurred with the number of monocytes, where the increase in the number of monocytes on POD 3 was seen to be significantly greater in the \"nutrition\" group. There was no change in the number of monocytes on POD 3 in the \"no food\" group. The number of leucocytes increased significantly in the \"nutrition\" group, a fact which can be explained by the significant differences between the number of monocytes and lymphocytes. Table 3 describes the changes over time in the specific subpopulations. As described above, on POD 3 the number of all types of lymphocytes in the acquired cellular response was significantly reduced. This applies to T lymphocytes (CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+) and NK cells (CD3-, CD16+, and CD56+). On POD 7 in the \"nutrition\" group, however, an increase in the number of CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+ cells was observed, which meant that the significant decrease in the number of these cells on POD 3, compared to the preoperative values, had been corrected. This did not apply to the \"no food\" group. Table 4 illustrates the significant differences in the number of cells in subpopulations among the groups. On POD 3, the decline in NK cells was significantly less in the \"nutrition\" group than in the \"no food\" group. This means that diet affects the number of NK cells and NK activity in the early postoperative period. Other authors have described something similar (Toft et al. 2002) . Tables 2 and 4 show an increased number of lymphocytes, monocytes, and NK cells in the \"nutrition\" group compared to the number of cells in the \"no food\" group. This may explain why the number of infections in the nutrition group was significantly lower. An increased number of cells is not necessarily the same as increased activity. Table 5 shows the changes over time in activity markers. Overall, activity markers either did not change or increased significantly in the \"nutrition\" group. The opposite trend was observed in the \"no food\" group where there was either no change in the number of cells with expression of CD 69+ or significant decreases in the expression of CD25+, CD54 +, and HLA-DR on POD 3. On POD 7, there were significant increases compared to POD 3. This can be interpreted as a response to the \"no food\" group beginning to eat food on POD 5. Table 6 shows the major differences between the two groups. There is a significantly greater expression of HLA-DR activated cells in the nutrition group. HLA-DR is part of the complex that connects the monocyte with the T-helper cell (see above). There were already significantly more HLA-DR-exposed cells in the nutrition group on POD 3, which shows clearly that the expression of cellular immunity was significantly more pronounced in the nutrition group.",
