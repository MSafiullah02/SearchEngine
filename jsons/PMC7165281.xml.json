A novel RNA betacoronavirus was identified as the liable pathogen of a highly spread viral pneumonia and was named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).1\n,\n2 The World Health Organization (WHO) named this new viral infection Coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19), and at the middle of March 2020 announced COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic. According to the daily report of the WHO, so far more than 500 000 patients have been affected worldwide and more than 23 000 deaths have been reported.3 The major transmission route of the disease is human to human through droplets and close contact.2 The mean incubation period is 5 days, and the spectrum of clinical manifestation range from asymptomatic to fever, cough, myalgia, fatigue and to rapid onset of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) as well as multiple organ failure.2\n,\n4\n",

In patients with hypoxia, in the setting of severe infection or ARDS due to SARS-CoV-2, elevated cTnI levels have been reported which suggests myocardial injury. A meta-analysis of 4 studies in China, with an overall of 341 patients showed that patients with severe COVID-19 had considerably higher cTnI levels in comparison with those who experienced mild disease (standardized mean difference: 25.6 ng/L; 95% confidence intervals: 6.8-44.5 ng/L).10 Both ischemic and non-ischemic myocardial conditions such as myocarditis may cause myocardial injury.11\n,\n12 Retrospective studies in hospitalized patients in China, showed that cardiac injury was more common in patients admitted to the intensive care units (ICU) and among those who died; thus it may be correlated with worse prognosis.7\n,\n11\n,\n13 A recently published case report showed that a man who was admitted to the hospital in China due to chest pain and dyspnea for three days and presented ST-segment elevation on the electrocardiogram (ECG), increased cardiac biomarkers as well as left ventricular dysfunction in the echocardiogram, had no signs of coronary stenosis in the CT coronary angiography; the coronavirus nucleic acid test was positive.14 Interestingly the patient was treated with methylprednisolone and intravenous immunoglobulin added on antibiotics, and after three weeks the ventricular function as well as the myocardial injury markers had fully recovered to the normal range.14 It should be noted that there are limited data regarding the association of acute coronary syndrome and COVID-19.",

An underlying myocarditis, could be a reasonable explanation in COVID-19 patients experiencing cardiac injury, in terms of elevated cTnI with new onset arrhythmia. A study showed that the prevalence of heart failure was 23% among patients with COVID-19.11 However, it remains unclear whether new cardiomyopathy (i.e. due to myocarditis) or worsening of an underlying myocardial dysfunction could explain the high prevalence of heart failure in this population.16\n,\n17 It should be noted that pericardial involvement has not been reported yet.

There is evidence from animal studies that mainly ARBs and maybe ACE inhibitors, upregulate membrane-bound ACE2.23 However, the upregulation is observed after high dose administration of ARBs in animals and not in doses commonly used in humans; in addition, the upregulation has been documented mainly in cardiac and renal tissue and not in the lungs.23 Experimental data have shown that transgenic mice that overexpress ACE2 are prone to extensive lung injury after infection with SARS-CoV.24 On the other hand, transgenic mice deficient for ACE2 showed severe acute lung failure during sepsis or infection with viral agents including SARS-CoV;25 moreover, treatment of the mice with recombinant ACE2 prevented acute severe lung injury.25 Another point that should be addressed is the following: during acute lung injury, alveolar ACE2 appears to be downregulated.23 This would decrease angiotensin II metabolism, thus resulting in higher local levels of this peptide, which increases alveolar permeability and accelerates lung injury.23 Given this fact, one can speculate that having increased ACE2 expression by preexisting ARBs treatment may actually be protective for the lungs in the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Therefore, the data so far in humans indicate that there is no evidence for a potential beneficial or harmful effect of ACE inhibitors or ARBs during infection with the SARS-CoV-2.",
