The maximum score of each variable was set as 100. The performance of the nomogram was measured based on the Harrell concordance index (C-index).

Increased creatinine (\u2265133 \u03bcmol/L) and total bilirubin (> 17.1 \u03bcmol/L) levels might be associated with the fatal outcome. Because ACE2 is widely expressed in multiple organs besides the lung, it is possible that SARS-CoV-2 could invade the local tissues and lead to both direct and indirect damage. The ensuing activation of immune response and cytokine storm will also play an important role in organ dysfunction. Overactivation of peripheral T cells, present as increases of CC4+CCR6+Th17 and high cytotoxicity of CD8 T cells, may contribute to immune injury in severe cases of COVID-19.21 In addition, the use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, antivirus agents, antibiotics, and traditional Chinese medicine may be associated with liver and renal injury. These findings call for multidisciplinary cooperation and monitoring of the organ dysfunction.",

First, in some cases, there was incomplete documentation of the history, symptoms, or laboratory findings in the electronic database, even after making efforts regarding feedback and recollection. Some diagnoses of co-existing illness were from patients\u2019 self-reports at admission, which might lead to recall bias. Although the cohort had a broad coverage of all patients and regions, the nonresponse bias cannot be fully excluded. Second, as a retrospective and observational study, we currently could not set up a validation cohort to assess the predictive accuracy due to the urgent timeline of this special situation. However, we used the bootstrap resampling cohort and showed that the C-index is ideal, suggesting the nomogram is a good model for predicting outcomes. Likewise, the calibration curves for survival probability also showed a good consistency between the prediction and the observation.",
