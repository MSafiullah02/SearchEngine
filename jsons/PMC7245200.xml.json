            "text": "The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic has crippled vascular surgery practices around the world with almost four million cases and over 260,000 deaths as of May 6, 20201. In order to preserve hospital resources including personal protective equipment and ventilators as well as to \u201cflatten the curve\u201d of exposure of patients and healthcare providers to COVID-19, most centers have imposed limitations on elective/scheduled surgical practices2. For vascular surgeons, this may include limiting procedures such as peripheral arterial disease with claudication, asymptomatic carotid artery disease, small aortic aneurysm, superficial venous disease, and most dialysis access. Many vascular procedures however are urgent, with delay in treatment resulting in loss of limb or life. In the aftermath of such a global dampening of practice, resumption of surgical services needs to be thoughtful in order to optimize the care of patients and minimize risk to the healthcare team. A recent joint statement from the American College of Surgeons, American Society of Anesthesiologists, Association of Perioperative Registered Nurses, and the American Hospital Association suggests this return of service should not occur until several factors are met, including a sustained reduction in the rate of new regional COVID-19 cases for 14 days and the availability of both PPE and COVID-19 testing3. Additionally, they recommend case prioritization to ensure those patients with the highest needs will be treated first, although they don\u2019t specifically comment on these cases, deferring instead to local committees created to adjudicate all cases.",

            "text": "At Saint Louis University, we have adopted the Elective Surgery Acuity Scale (ESAS) to aid in decision making regarding delay in surgery for patients during this time of peak pandemic (Figure 1\n). Patients are sorted based off acuity of diagnosis and health status into tiers from 1 (low acuity procedures) to 3 (high acuity procedures). Those in Tiers 1 and 2 are preferentially delayed while those in tier 3 proceed to surgery. These guidelines were adopted by the American College of Surgeons as well as the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services in their recommendations for elective procedure scheduling during the pandemic4. In order to prepare for resumption of surgical practice, we have developed an algorithm to prioritize surgical care of patients in our center based off these same tiers, the results of COVID-19 testing, and the availability of ICU beds (Figure 2\n). Those with active COVID-19 diagnoses (or those who are symptomatic and in testing) should be delayed. First priority of procedure should go towards the healthiest patients with the highest acuity needs and the lowest need for intensive care utilization. This system will allow care to be delivered to the patients with the highest need and also optimize outcomes from these procedures when performed. We wish to share this protocol with your readership who may be struggling with creating a system to address the backlog of cases that have undoubtedly developed in their practice. We welcome any comments or feedback as this is an untested algorithm at this time.",
