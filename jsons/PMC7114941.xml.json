The first isolations of viruses from water came in the 1950s and 1960s for surface waters and drinking waters, respectively (Gerba and Rose, 1989). Yet it had long been understood that enteric viruses such as poliovirus were shed in feces and thus by association present in sewage and sewage-polluted waters. Our conventional definition of environmental virology has primarily focused on enteric viruses and contaminated drinking water, fecal-oral transmission, and associated person-to-person transmission. Likewise, the management and control of waterborne viruses has focused on disinfection of drinking water and vaccinations. Despite the tremendous improvements in water and sanitation management fueled by a better understanding of the nature of viruses, emerging viruses such as the polyomaviruses and reemerging epidemics of age-old viruses such as poliovirus, as well as concerns associated with intentional use of eradicated viruses such as the smallpox virus, challenge our conventional definition of \u201cenvironmental virology\u201d and traditional approaches to control.",

Scarcity of water in many parts of the world has forced people to turn to increasingly less pristine sources of water for their drinking and other needs. This has given rise to an increased incidence of waterborne disease. The burgeoning world population is also placing a greater strain on the current world water supply. Irrigation currently consumes approximately 70\u201380% of the world's fresh and groundwater supply while polluting lakes and streams through surface runoff of pesticides, fertilizers, and land-applied biosolids with their associated pathogen loads. The US Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) anticipates a net expansion of irrigated land of some 45 million hectares in 93 developing countries to a total of 242 million hectares in 2030 and projects that agricultural-water withdrawals will increase by some 14% from 2000 to 2030 to meet future food production needs (FAO, 2002).",

In addition, the increasing scarcity of pristine water sources has meant that the water cycle is being short circuited in order to provide adequate water for drinking, recreation, power generation, agriculture, and industrial processing. The assessment of the impairment of waterways for the various uses based on the \u201cindicator bacteria\u201d and Escherichia coli has not provided enough specificity in regard to health risk, sources of the pollution, identification of the responsible party, and control. This has fueled a demand for advanced pathogen detection.",

Certain microbiological advances like the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and microarray technology may provide the tools necessary for monitoring any new agent of interest. The era of pathogen discovery is not over. We should be prepared to use all the microbiological advances to continue to understand the transmission of diseases through water. This must then be coupled with our knowledge of engineering to determine how to maintain and develop the quantity and quality of our water resources.

Each spot on an array serves as a single test at which a hybridization of DNA, immunological attachment, or chemical reaction can occur. These arrays can be useful for screening multiple samples against multiple targets but they are neither as sensitive nor as specific as PCR or cell culture. Microarray technology is enabled by the ability to deliver submicroliter volumes of material to an attachment surface or matrix. DNA microarrays are arrays in which DNA\u2013DNA/DNA\u2013cDNA or DNA\u2013RNA hybridization reactions are an indication of a positive/negative reaction. Spotted DNA microarrays consist of either PCR generated or synthesized oligonucleotides that have been printed or mechanically spotted on to specially coated glass slides. In situ synthesized arrays have their probes chemically synthesized directly on to the support matrix.",

Febit's Geniom microarrays contain only 6000 features but hybridization can be carried out with eight chips in parallel allowing multiple sample processing (Guimil et al., 2003). Nimblegen microarrays contain 3,90,000 probes per array and are manufactured using a micromirror focusing technique. Less expensive glass slide arrays for smaller probe sets are also within the in-house fabrication capability of most research institutions (approximately 16,000 features per slide). Current limitations of the technology include issues regarding validation and low starting microbial biomass (Wu et al., 2006) and need to be addressed before the technology may be applied.",

The highly disseminated nature of the public health system, however, means that it takes either a long time or a massive influx of cases before a disease outbreak is recognized. The trend towards increasingly urbanized and dense city living and the more frequent travel between communities necessitates that community health monitoring adopts a more proactive preventative role instead of merely recording and reporting disease data. In order to do so, there need to be tools that are able to screen for the large panel of possible viral pathogens which are representative of the pathogen loads present in the larger community. To meet this requirement it becomes logical to monitor the community's sewage using microarrays designed to detect the presence of waterborne pathogens.",
