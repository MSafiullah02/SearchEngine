In India, the number of active patients infected with novel coronavirus (COVID-19) is 41,472 with 2109 deaths.1 Till 10th May 2020 total number of cases infected Worldwide with Corona Virus is 4,122,994, out of which 1,451,630 recovered and 280,882 died of which 2019 deaths were reported from India with a death rate of 3.35%1\n,\n4 The high infectivity rate of COVID-19 has not only created a health emergency in most parts of the world but overwhelmed the existing health system of all countries alike. To avoid such a situation and to contain its spread Social lockdown and Isolation being practiced by India and most countries and it is the best prophylactic measure. The impact of the pandemic is so colossal that in these times all medical specialities have ceased to exist and there remains only one speciality and that is \u201cCOVID doctors''. In affirmation of the new role orthopaedic surgeons were and are manning frontline COVID-19 duties, but post easing of lockdown measures they will have to increase their outpatient dispensation (which are already running meagerly with limitations in time and census) to bring orthopaedic healthcare on track to pre-COVID era. Considering the fact that 69% of COVID -19 patients are asymptomatic, its highly infectious nature and realizing that the disease may remain in society for a longer period of time, it is imperative that the Outpatient Department follows standard and universal operating protocols, so as not to lose the health gains of lockdown.1\n,\n5\n",

This avoids overcrowding and the buffer intervening time allows for some overshooting of patient-doctor consultation and may be used for sterilizing the OPD premises. The number of patients should be restricted to 25 in a day per doctor (9\u20133:30 p.m.), so the number of slots can vary according to the number of OPD Rooms and Doctors. (Author perspective)[Each 12 by 10 feet OPD room that is approximately 3.65 \u00d7 3.04 square meter should allow 2 doctors (with computer tables) and 2 patients at a time maintaining a social distance of atleast 1 m. At one end is stationed an examination table of 24-28cms in a glass/aluminum/plastic sheet enclosure. (If rooms are smaller (10 \u00d7 10ft=3.04 \u00d7 3.04 m) only one doctor and examination table or 2 doctors without an examination table are proposed as needed). So, if you have 6 rooms, keep 3 as buffers which are sanitized for next day use. 3 rooms will house 6 doctors, the number of patients to be seen per day is 6X25= 150 patients. At 9 am -3 pm if consultation time is 8-10 min per patient \u2013a doctor will spend 25X10 = 250 or approximate 4 hours of patient-doctor consultation.

It can provide rapid access to medical practitioners, who are not immediately available, thus achieving the goal of quality care to all. In addition, it makes available extra working hands for providing physical care at the respective health institutions.

There needs to be an efficient and well-connected telemedicine chamber (1\u20136megabits/sec for video communications on phones and 25megabits/sec for computers) with a recording facility for audio and video consultation at every hospital in the working hour.9 The main telemedicine chamber of the hospital should accommodate a general physician (MBBS or resident doctor/RMP) who can advise on general orthopedic problems (RMP to patient consult). If the patient's problems are beyond his medical capability, he can transfer the call to the concerned orthopaedic department which has its own local telemedicine facility manned by an orthopaedic surgeon (RMP to specialist consult).The patient should be explained clearly regarding the limitations of telemedicine and informed consent may be taken in this regard. The telemedicine will avoid overcrowding, unnecessary hospital visits and help in providing consultation to the COVID 19 positive cases & patients of containment zones. Recently the medical council of India has officially allowed and issued guidelines telemedicine practice in India.17 The technology used for telemedicine services carries the potential for abuse. Some of the risks, drawbacks and limitations can be mitigated through appropriate training, enforcement of standards, protocols, penalties and guidelines. It is suggested that initially, only audio or text can be used for telemedicine, and gradually as norms become clearer and get established, one can shift to video consultation. The field of teleradiology and telepathology services can be practiced from the beginning, under the hospital standard of care, as they are carried out in controlled environments by trained professionals, and therefore carry a lesser risk. Online consultation facility is already available for COVID patients/suspects on the Aarogya Setu app via Aarogya Setu mitr. It is suggested that a similar facility/app may be created to facilitate telemedicine in all specialities including Orthopaedics (see Fig. 6).",
