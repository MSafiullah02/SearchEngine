The unexpected phenomenon lets us think about the underlying problems that caused the sudden death and some issues maybe ignored and that should be appropriately resolved. The initial manifestation of severe COVID-19 pneumonia patients was hypoxemic respiratory failure, accompanied by rapid increased reactive heart rate and susceptibility to supraventricular arrhythmia [2]. It is notable that a proportion of these patients developed sinus bradycardia, which was significantly different from other patients with multiple types of respiratory failure.",

Some experts believed that the virus invasion into myocardium led to severe myocarditis or the severe \u201ccytokine storm\u201d-induced acute myocardial injury may explain the sudden death in some affected patients [3]. It is noteworthy that about 1/3 of the patients with severe illness in our study developed sinus bradycardia (Fig. 1). The troponin and proBNP were basically normal among these patients except for those with renal failure (Table 1). The clinical characteristics of explosive myocarditis and myocardial infarction were not presented among these patients, suggesting these are not the cause of sinus bradycardia in these patients. It was previously reported that no pathological evidence of myocarditis or myocardial microinfarction was observed in the heart of suffered patients [4], consisting with our results. Therefore, we speculated that sudden death among some severe patients with improved symptoms post-treatment may be caused by severe arrhythmia such as ventricular fibrillation induced by severe sinus delay.\n",

A few patients had mild to moderate decreased thyroid function, which was consistent with secondary pathological thyroid syndrome and may also be one of the causes of sinus bradycardia. When viral nucleic acid tests gradually turned negative, the heart rate returned to normal no matter whether the patient\u2019s condition improved or worsened and the uses of catecholamine were gradually discontinued. According to the results, we speculated that the inhibitory effect of virus on sinus node activity was the main cause of sinus bradycardia in these patients.",

Zou et al. identified specific cell types including myocardial cells which were vulnerable to COVID-19 infection through scRNA-seq data analyses [5]. However, there was no severe myocardial damage or cardiac insufficiency in our patients with sinus bradycardia. We referred the gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis for ACE2 gene in GeneCards Database (https://www.genecards.org/). Biological processes (BP) for ACE2 gene showed that it not only promoted the contraction of cardiac muscle, but also regulated the cardiac conduction. Donoghue et al. demonstrated that cardiac ACE2 overexpression in transgenic mice caused sudden death in a gene dose-dependent fashion; they also found that increased ACE2 expression led to progressive conduction and rhythm disturbances with lethal ventricular arrhythmias via detailed electrophysiology [6]. In light of those evidences, it may be speculated that the toxic role of virus on cardiac conduction system instead of that generated myocardial damage resulted in a sudden death of patients infected with COVID-19.",
