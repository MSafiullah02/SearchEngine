Acute pharyngitis is one of the most common causes of physician visits, accounting for 2% of ambulatory visits in the United States every year (1) . In adults, GAS is found in only 10% of patients who seek medical attention. Although the majority of causes of pharyngitis do not require treatment with antibiotics, the majority of patients nonetheless receive them. According to the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey, 18 million patients sought care for a sore throat in the United States during 1996 (2) . Therefore, because approximately 75% of patients who see physicians for pharyngitis receive antibiotics (3), the treatment of pharyngitis is a major cause of excess antibiotic use in the United States. In addition to side effects from medications, the consequences of unnecessary antibiotic use have led to more resistant bacterial organisms.",

The pathogenesis of pharyngitis is not well-understood, but many theories have been offered. When a group of volunteers were given rhinoviral infections, bradykinin and lysylbradykinin were produced. These are known inflammatory mediators that can excite nerve endings in the pharynx, resulting in pain (5) . Other research done with laboratory animals found that viral infections produced an inflammatory response by invading pharyngeal cells (4) . Adenovirus and Epstein-Barr virus produce lymphoid hyperplasia and tonsilar exudates (4). Herpes simplex virus causes oral mucosa ulcerations that are frequently found in the anterior portion of the mouth. In contrast, coxsackievirus causes oral ulcers located in the posterior mouth and pharynx. Pharyngitis caused by streptococcus B produces inflammation of the posterior pharynx. In patients with Epstein-Barr virus, as many as 10% of patients will have a GAS superinfection (4) . In some patients with Corynebacterium diphtheriae pharyngitis, a gray membrane can be seen over the posterior pharynx.",

An upper respiratory infection commonly begins with malaise, fever, headache, myalgias, and then coryza and sore throat. In assessing patients with pharyngitis, there is great importance in differentiating GAS from all other causes. Research has showed that physicians are poor predictors of which patients will have positive throat cultures for GAS pharyngitis. The sensitivity and specificity range from 55 to 74% and 58 to 76%, respectively (1). The Centor criteria were created to aid physicians in diagnosing GAS. The four criteria are tonsillar exudates, history of fever, absence of cough, and tender anterior cervical adenopathy. If three or four criteria are met, the positive predictive value is 40 to 60% (20) . The negative predictive value of less than three criteria is 80% (20) . The sensitivity and specificity are both increased to approximately 75% when the criteria are implemented according to some studies (21) . Clinical features that are consistent with GAS pharyngitis include sore throat, sudden onset of symptoms, fever, and headache. Clinical symptoms consistent with a viral etiology include conjunctivitis, coryza, cough, and diarrhea.",

When patients have two, three, or four criteria, a rapid antigen test (RAT) should be performed. If the RAT is positive, then antibiotic therapy should be started. The algorithm that we recommend is to test patients with two or three criteria with an RAT, and treat those with a positive test and those with four criteria. The final option is to not use diagnostic tests and use antibiotics to treat patients with three or four criteria (22) . The guidelines do not apply to immunocompromised patients and patients with a history of rheumatic fever, valvular heart disease, sore throats not caused by acute pharyngitis, and patients that have recurrent or chronic pharyngitis (22) .
