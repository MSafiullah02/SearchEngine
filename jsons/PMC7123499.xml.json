In the majority of airbag injuries, a child was unrestrained or improperly restrained in the front seat, and all injured infants were in the front seat in rear-facing child restraint seats (Fig. 27.1a, b). The smaller stature of children and infants and the position of the head closer to the upward deploying airbag may account for the mechanism of these injuries. The relatively flat and horizontal character of the atlanto-occipital (AO) articulation in children also places them at greater risk of AO dislocation or separation (Saveika and Thorogood 2006). Other large studies have confirmed passenger airbag injuries when children under 14 years of age occupy the front passenger seat (Newgard and Lewis 2005).\n",

            "text": "Children are more vulnerable to blunt abdominal injury from vehicular seat-belt restraints as compared to adults, particularly when child booster seats are not used or the child is inappropriately restrained by the lap-shoulder harness system designed for adults (Lapner et al. 2001). Current recommendations call for use of special child restraint systems until the child is over 4\u20329\u2033 (1.4 M) tall, and the lap restraint can be positioned on the upper thighs (not the abdomen) and the shoulder harness crosses the chest while not crossing directly over the neck (American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Injury, Violence and Poison Prevention 2011). The immature pelvis of a child under the 4\u20329\u2033 (1.4 M) height requirement cannot be appropriately restrained with the lap-shoulder harness until the child is tall enough to position the harness in the correct areas (across the thighs and not the abdomen). Abdominal-wall contusions are infrequent in both optimally and suboptimally seat belt-restrained children, but when abdominal contusions are present, they often herald intra-abdominal injury (Lutz et al. 2004). Intestinal injury, perforation, and shearing of the fixed ligaments and mesenteric structures are the most common abdominal manifestations of pediatric seat belt-related injuries (Davies 2004). Because the small anterior pelvis of a child is not appropriately stabilized by the lap restraint system designed for adults, deceleration allows the seat belt to override the child\u2019s pelvis, producing hyperflexion of the child over the lap belt. This forces the abdominal organs against the vertebral column and momentarily increases the intraluminal pressure of the hollow organs, resulting in sudden compression. In addition to the abdominal injuries, the deceleration-induced compression and hyperflexion of the abdomen may also cause lumbar spine and sacral injuries (Hart et al. 2004; Papavasiliou et al. 2007). Intestinal compromise may be immediate or may occur days to weeks after the injury (Hardacre et al. 1990; Lynch et al. 1996). Posttraumatic small-intestinal obstruction and delayed perforation may comprise an important finding in a forensic evaluation of a delayed vehicular death.",

In children under the age of 4 years, deaths from \u201cbackover\u201d accidents in driveways peak in incidence, likely due to the small stature of children, their tendency to \u201chide\u201d or play behind parked vehicles, and their lack of awareness of the dangers of moving vehicles. Crush injuries of young children, usually occurring from low-velocity impacts resulting from vehicles backing out of home driveways, are often fatal due to blunt-force injuries of the head (including closed-head injuries), skeleton, and torso (Partrick et al. 1998). The most common vehicles involved in these accidents are sport utility vehicles (SUV), trucks, and minivans, as opposed to passenger cars (sedans, compact cars, etc.), perhaps due to the increased frequency of larger vehicle ownership by families with small children and the increased \u201cblind spot\u201d of vehicles with higher ground clearance behind the vehicle. In contrast to most other vehicular head injuries, these \u201cbackover\u201d injuries are generally static; that is, they do not have significant rotational and acceleration\u2013deceleration components.",

The point of vehicular impact (bumper) in a small child is at the head or chest level, both sites that are above the child\u2019s center of gravity. Because of this injury location, the initial impact usually results in a second impact, with the initial impact projecting the child away from the vehicle and against another fixed object, usually the ground. Consequently, the child may be run over by a subsequent vehicle. In contrast, the impact point in older children is below the child\u2019s center of gravity, resulting in impact patterns similar to that of adults. In older children, the impact point is at the legs with the body projected over or onto the hood of the car. Rotational motion is seen in these impacts with the legs rotating over the head on impact and with increasing speed, and the entire body may somersault over the vehicle following hood/windshield impact. The injury patterns seen in children reflect these different impact patterns, with head, neck, and chest injuries more common in pediatric pedestrian injury populations than in the adult population (Chakravarthy et al. 2007).",

The vehicles are often operated off-road and on irregular terrains, which contribute to vehicle instability and subsequent vehicle rollovers (Finn and MacDonald 2010). Crush injuries and asphyxia may result from rollovers of heavy off-road vehicles onto individuals. Blunt trauma, fractures, and amputations may occur from impacts with trees, fences, or other obstacles. \u201cClothesline\u201d injuries, including deep lacerations or cervical fracture, may occur to the face and neck when vehicles pass under horizontally strung fence lines. In some instances, multiple children are involved in an accident when an off-road vehicle is being driven with children riding on sleds or skateboards tied behind the vehicle (similar to waterskiing). If the vehicle makes a sudden turn, the increased rotational velocity may throw the child who is on the skateboard/sled away from the vehicle, resulting in blunt-force injuries due to the primary impact and/or a secondary impact with a subsequent structure (tree, vehicle, etc.). The majority of these accidents occur at lower velocities than traditional motor vehicle accidents, although some motorized off-road vehicles can reach speeds of 30 mph (50 km/h) or more, increasing the likelihood of fatal injuries and approaching patterns seen in traditional motor vehicle collisions.",

These and other regulations reflect efforts to reduce accidents and fatalities among adolescents until driving skills become more accomplished. Some jurisdictions may also limit or have additional requirements before licensing adolescents to operate motorcycles or may restrict operators less than 18 years of age to a smaller-sized motorcycle.

Infants are more susceptible to carbon monoxide toxicity due to the greater affinity of fetal hemoglobin. Individuals with hemoglobinopathies, such as sickle-cell anemia or thalassemia, may also have increased susceptibility to carbon monoxide toxicity (Blumenthal 2001). Rarely, defective motor vehicle exhaust systems may produce high levels of carbon monoxide within the interiors of moving or idling vehicles. \u201cOpen-air\u201d carbon monoxide poisoning is a well-known hazard around combustion engine exhaust, even from vehicles in outdoor spaces. Asphyxia and positional asphyxia may occur with vehicle rollovers, entrapment within vehicle restraint systems, or in automatic window or door closure systems. Findings at autopsy are similar to other asphyxia deaths, with petechial hemorrhages often seen in eyes and intrathoracic cavity and hemorrhage within sinuses and sphenoid processes. Cyanosis, often intense, is present above the restraint area. Often the lividity patterns reflect the entrapment, clothing, and/or vehicular restraints (Fig. 27.3a\u2013e).\n",

In these instances, investigative skill is required to correctly ascertain the initiating cause of injury. Chest impacts may produce cardiac contusions, including injury to ventricular free walls, papillary muscles, or the ventricular septum. These injured areas may rupture acutely, causing death (Fig. 27.4). Alternatively, the contusion may result in an aneurysm, infarction, or ventricular rupture days or weeks after the initial injury. Cardiac contusion results from blunt-traumatic impact to the chest with compression of the heart against the sternum and/or spine. The momentarily high intrathoracic pressure with deceleration may also contribute to this type of injury. Abdominal trauma may produce ileus or injury to hollow organs, particularly the small intestine, resulting in rupture and/or peritonitis several days following the injury. Vascular trauma does occur in children, but less commonly than in the adult population (Eddy et al. 1990; Riches et al. 2002; Choit et al. 2006). These vascular injuries usually present acutely with hemorrhage or infarction, but may be delayed in discovery or presentation. Although uncommon, children may also develop pulmonary thromboemboli as a result of local trauma to the leg (Fig. 27.5) or prolonged immobilization and present as sudden death days or weeks later.\n\n",

            "text": "Death from hyperthermia of infants and children left in cars is well known and increasing in incidence since the recommendation of placing infants in carriers in the back seat. Usually these tragic deaths result from a caregiver forgetting that the infant is in the vehicle. The temperature in closed vehicles may rapidly rise well over the ambient temperature, and car interiors may reach 140o F (60o C) or more within 15 minutes (McLaren et al. 2005). Infants are most at risk for this event since older children may be able to independently leave vehicles and/or alert adults to their presence. Autopsy findings are generally nonspecific in car hyperthermia deaths, although intrathoracic petechiae are often seen (Fig. 27.6). Body temperature at time of discovery is important to confirm hyperthermia; however, this is often not available to the forensic investigator. Interior vehicle temperature is often not recorded and, if available, may not be reliable, as opening the car door will rapidly disperse heat, resulting in an erroneously low measurement. Due to the rapidity of heat exposure in a vehicle, vitreous electrolytes may not demonstrate a dehydration pattern, as is seen in slower exposure to high temperatures. If a victim survives, complications of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and multisystem organ failure may be fatal hours-to-days after the hyperthermic event. There is considerable variation in the certification of the manner of death in these tragic events, with some practitioners certifying as accidents and others as homicides.\n",

Drowning in natural lakes, irrigation dams, or streams within farms is another common cause of death in farm children. Asphyxial deaths can occur from hypoxic closed spaces or slipping into grain storage bins. Lacerations, skeletal fractures, amputations, and blunt-traumatic injuries result from falls occurring in farming activities or entrapment in farm equipment. Complex tools, firearms, and sharp implements are necessary for farming and ranching and pose a danger of injury and death in children. Falls from, or kicks by, large animals and a wide variety of animal bites also occur more commonly within rural settings. Off-road vehicles, such as ATVs and snowmobiles, are more common in rural settings, increasing the risk of injury and death from the use of these vehicles by children (Lim et al. 2004).",

Nearly half of the tractors examined in the study lacked rollover protection structures (ROPS). Most tractors did not have seat-belt and harness systems, or these systems were difficult to use, putting all operators, particularly young operators or youngsters riding with adults, at risk. Many tractors had a narrow front-wheel stance, creating stability issues and increasing the risk of rollover accidents. Many tractors had loose or damaged seats. Protective shields for starting were present on just over half the trailers examined, and nearly a third had the starting mechanism fully exposed. Rear-wheel fenders exposed operators to moving tires in nearly 40 % of the tractors. Fully functional mounting and dismounting access steps and handrails were present in less than half of the operating tractors and, when present, were designed for an adult body. Many tractors had no functional lights, and nearly 70 % had no rear-view mirrors. Complicating these design and safety issues is the fact that all of these devices are designed for adult operators, not children. Ergonomic studies have demonstrated that even optimally functioning devices may have significant limitations for young operators who have not reached adult stature (Chang et al. 2010). Operation of tractors, equipment, and vehicles is common on family farms well before the age of normal driving licensing. In the USA and Canada, children from farms and ranches have an average of 6 years\u2019 experience in driving tractors and other farm equipment on family farms prior to formal licensing for motor vehicles (Marlenga et al. 2001), indicating that many farm and ranch children routinely begin driving farm equipment at the age of 10 years or younger.",

Secondary infections may be more common with injuries sustained on farms and ranches, reflecting contamination with dirt, animal excrement, and other foreign substances present in these environments. Farm and ranch residents may also be exposed to pesticides, herbicides, and a variety of hazardous inorganic chemicals, many of which are not common in urban settings and may cause severe injury and death (Neidich 1993). The use of alternative or supplemental heating, such as woodstoves, contributes to the higher incidence of rural fires and fire-related deaths.

The pathophysiology of drownings involves lung and airway effects with resulting cerebral anoxia. In most drownings, the initial insult results from water within the airways and lungs causing inadequate oxygenation. Aspiration of mud, debris, sand, or vomit into the bronchial tree and alveoli may also occur and complicates the physiological response. This also increases the risk of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), chemical pneumonitis, and pneumonia if the individual is successfully resuscitated. Freshwater inactivates pulmonary surfactant on contact, resulting in atelectasis, further complicating oxygenation and increasing the pulmonary blood shunting physiological response. Osmotic forces may draw more fluid into alveoli from pulmonary intravascular spaces. The resulting anoxia and acidosis have the most immediate and consequential impact on central-nervous-system (CNS) function, although other organ systems may be involved in pathophysiological changes. These changes include cardiac dysrhythmias, blood-pressure changes from catecholamine release, carbon dioxide retention, and hypothermia. Metabolic acidosis is significant in \u201cnear-drowning\u201d victims. Although initial experiments suggested that fluid and electrolyte imbalance and hemoglobin/hematocrit changes from osmolality differences played a major role in drowning, these changes may not be as common or as important as first thought. Deaths are reported in \u201csecondary\u201d or \u201cdelayed drowning\u201d scenarios where acute lung injury and rapid pulmonary failure from inhaled water, debris, or chemicals within water produce death several hours after the event.",

Numerous tests have been proposed for establishing the diagnosis of drowning, including diatom presence and electrolytes or other substance differences in right versus left cardiac blood; however, none have proven sufficiently valid for forensic use. Tenacious froth, often with slight blood tingeing, may be present in the mouth and nares and is thought to result from an admixture of water, pulmonary surfactant, mucus, and blood plasma protein (Fig. 27.7). This finding is supportive of drowning but is not present in all cases, and the absence should not be used as criteria for excluding drowning. Internally, froth and water are often present in the airway; the lungs are often heavy and edematous. During the process of drowning, individuals may swallow large quantities of water, distending the stomach. This constellation of heavy, waterlogged lungs often with water in the stomach is termed \u201cwet drowning\u201d and is present in the vast majority of drowning deaths; however, in a minority (about 10 %) of drownings, there is no water in lungs, airways, or stomach. Laryngospasm is postulated to occur in these cases closing the airway and resulting in \u201cdry drowning.\u201d In all drowning cases, the struggle to breathe or submersion below 2 m of water may also result in pressure changes reflected in hemorrhage in the inner ear and sinuses that may occasionally be seen at autopsy (Fig. 27.8). Hemolysis of red blood cells may be present if copious quantities of freshwater are present. Often lividity patterns have a bright red tone when drowning has occurred in cold water (Fig. 27.9). All of these findings however are nonspecific and may occur in other deaths. Conversely, drowning may occur with none of these signs. Finally, in deaths from \u201cnear drowning\u201d or \u201csecondary drowning,\u201d the findings at autopsy will more closely reflect the anoxic and secondary complications rather than the original drowning event.\n\n\n",

Routine drug and alcohol screening should be performed to rule out incapacitating toxicities such as alcohol or opiate intoxication. Depending on potential medical and other case findings, additional toxicology or clinical testing, including vitreous electrolyte, ketone, and glucose levels, may be helpful (Byard and Summersides 2011). Forensic investigations of drowning deaths should document water temperature to assess the potential role of hypothermia in the context of the case.

Smoke is readily produced in fires, particularly home fires, and comprises the airborne solid and liquid particulates of combustion. Smoke is a direct eye and pulmonary irritant and is invariably accompanied by the toxic gas carbon monoxide (CO) with environmental levels of 5 % or more. The carboxyhemoglobin (COHb) saturation level in a human exposed to this level of CO gas will rise to 40 % or more within 30 seconds (Peck 2011). Other toxic gases such as hydrogen cyanide (from synthetic fibers or materials) or the highly irritating acrolein (from wood and natural products) may also be present (Einhorn 1975). Concomitantly, environmental oxygen levels in the fire environment diminish from the consumption of oxygen by combustion. Humans become significantly physically impaired with oxygen levels below 17 %, and mental judgment is compromised at 14 % (Peck 2011). House fires may smolder with oxygen levels at 12 %, and all fires have an oxygen-deficient environment. The hypoxic environment likely contributes to fatalities in fires, but this impact cannot be directly measured by current technology used at autopsy.",

Select cases may benefit from CO saturation levels at different anatomic sites; for example, CO saturation of a fresh subdural hematoma or an area of trauma may reveal different levels compared with to cardiac blood, indicative of prefire trauma contributing to death. In cases where there are no/minimal airway-soot and nonlethal-CO saturation levels, death prior to fire must be seriously considered in the investigation. If an incendiary device is suspected, consultation with experts at the time of the initial investigation and autopsy will assist in the specialized collection of evidence from victims which is required for case investigation.",

Scalding is the most common burn injury in the pediatric age group (Shah et al. 2011); however, most accidental scalding injury is not fatal, so this is less commonly encountered at autopsy. The skin in a scalding injury is markedly erythematous, blistered, or, with severe injury, completely denuded with intense underlying erythema. Sharp borders are invariably present between injured and uninjured areas. A characteristic of scalding injury is the distinctive injured/uninjured pattern created by different modalities of injury, including pouring, splattering, or immersion. In an accidental scalding injury, irregular patterns of splattering are often present on the face, hands, or upper body often from children pulling or tipping pans of hot liquids from stoves. In immersion injury, larger, more confluent areas of burning are seen which correspond to the child being dipped or held in hot water. The buttocks, back, and feet are the most commonly burned areas. Characteristic of the immersion burn is the sparing of injury in skin folds, such as inguinal regions or behind the knees, resulting from the child withdrawing the lower extremities to avoid the immersion. Large-immersion pattern scalding injury is indicative of inflicted trauma. Children under 4 years of age are most at risk of immersion injury, and this form of inflicted trauma is often precipitated by adult frustration with toilet training of the young. Deaths from scalding injuries result from direct thermal injury or complications of these injuries. Vitreous chemistry and microbiological studies may be of value in investigating these deaths.",

Electrical injury is challenging since often there are no distinguishing features. A high index of suspicion, through scene investigation and consultation with electricians, is critical to identifying and appropriately categorizing these deaths. Low-voltage (<1,000 V) electrocution is the most common type of electrocution in both children and adults. The classic \u201cJoule burn\u201d or electrical mark is present in approximately half of the cases. When present, it identifies the point of electrical current entering or exiting the body. The skin may be whitish (Fig. 27.20) surrounding a raised, oval, or round crater with hyperemic borders and a pale center (Fig. 27.21). The shape of the burn may relate to the conductor shape in contact with the skin. Charring or edema is often present, and prolonged contact may result in deep burning of tissue. Microscopically, a \u201cstreaming\u201d appearance of cells and nuclei is often present accompanied by thermal homogenization of the dermis, deep fascia, and underlying tissue (Fig. 27.22). The epithelial basal layer of the skin is often detached. These changes are supportive, but not diagnostic of electrical injury. Occasionally, trace evidence of metal deposition from wires may be present at the site of electrical contact. The point where electric current exits the body is usually more difficult to identify and may be entirely absent. When present, it may have many of the characteristics of the site of current entry. Deaths from low-voltage electrocution are caused from electrical disturbances, primarily ventricular fibrillation of the cardiac conduction system or respiratory paralysis from interference with brainstem function, both autonomic disturbances that leave no physical trace to be identified at autopsy.\n\n\n",

The assessment of the degree of injury relative to the presenting story is a key component in distinguishing accidental and inflicted injury in the evaluation of a fall. In general, short-distance falls (less than 10 ft or 3 m) and falls down stairs rarely produce fatal injury to children (Chadwick and Salerno 1993; Chadwick et al. 1991; Chiaviello et al. 1994a). The presence of an adult may complicate injury to the child as falls occurring with children being carried down stairs by an adult have a higher injury index and more frequent skull fractures than falls down stairs by children themselves (Joffe and Ludwig 1988). The added mass of an adult and secondary impact(s) may be responsible for the increased severity of injury. Numerous studies of falls in specific situations exist in the literature including falls from buildings (Vish et al. 2005), playgrounds (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2012a; Petridou et al. 2002), beds/couches (Belechri et al. 2002), high chairs (Schalamon et al. 2006), infant walkers (Shields and Smith 2006; Chiaviello et al. 1994b), child-restraint seats (Desapriya et al. 2008), infant slings/carriers worn on adult bodies (Frisbee and Hennes 2000), heights (Thompson et al. 2011; Murray et al. 2000), and in hospital settings (Jamerson et al. 2009).

Careful and extensive photography of injuries, full radiological examination, fixation of the brain, and extensive histology are considered a baseline in the performance of the autopsy. Specialized dissections, such as removal of optic nerves, eyes, and posterior neck dissections including examination of cervical spinal roots (Matshes et al. 2011) may assist in interpretation. When there is a question of inflicted skeletal trauma, removal of the affected bone and the contralateral control bone may be important for evaluation. Careful review of all clinical records and police investigation is required for optimal interpretation. Correlation or identifying points of discordance with the given clinical history of how the event occurred is critical for case assessment. It may be helpful to have at least one meeting with all interested professionals, including clinicians providing care, radiologists (if appropriate), police and investigating agencies, child-protective services, and legal prosecutorial representation if jurisdictionally allowed.

This danger is amplified for young children where the injury rate for children in horseback riding is nearly twice that of adults from both falls and kicks from horses (Jagodzinski and DeMuri 2005).

The use of \u201cbreak-free\u201d stirrups can decrease the risk of entrapment and dragging following a dismounting fall. In nearly a third of horse-related injuries, the child is not riding the horse, but is kicked while in the vicinity of the horse. Head injuries are the most common and the most serious type of injury, accounting for most fatalities in horse-related accidents (Ghosh et al. 2000). In children, upper-extremity injury is more common than lower-extremity injury. Injuries to the back, pelvis, chest, and abdomen do occur, but with much less frequency in children as compared to adult horse enthusiasts. Horse-related injury is second in severity only to pedestrian versus motor vehicle injury, and horse-related injury has greater severity than injury from ATVs, bicycles, and passenger-related motor vehicle crashes (Bond et al. 1995). Helmet use reduces the severity of injury and the likelihood of death.",

Exsanguination and air embolism via neck veins are common causes of death in dog attacks. Most dog-attack fatalities have multiple puncture wounds from the teeth and extensive defleshing from the tearing and hunting behavior of the dog(s). Severity of injury and increase in fatal attacks may be increased when more than one dog is involved due to \u201cpack\u201d behavior (Tsokos et al. 2007). Abrasions and shallow incised wounds from paws or friction contact abrasions from surfaces may also be present. Large breed dogs may cause crushing injuries to the very young, including infants and toddlers, resulting in severe skull fractures and cerebral injuries. Several studies have examined the incidence and breed characteristics of fatal dog attacks, but may be confounded by the lack of accurate data into breed type actually present in a community as well as the effects of legislation restricting ownership of certain breeds (Raghavan 2008; Sacks et al. 2000).

Consultation with veterinarians is very useful for testing of an animal for rabies, tumors, or other conditions that may have led to the attack, including examination for prior animal maltreatment, starvation, or training for fighting activity.

The smaller mass and stature of young children also increases risk of fatal outcome of a wild-animal attack. Many animals may attack causing injury and death including bears, feral dogs, coyotes, cougars, and wolves on land and sharks or other predatory fish in the sea. Predatory land animals usually maul and bite victims, and if hunger precipitated the attack, the predators may devour most of the victim.

Shark attacks are characterized by large bites and tearing of limbs and viscera. Examination of the body for bite marks or fragments of teeth may assist in species identification. Crocodiles and alligators are territorial animals and may attack individuals within their home wetlands. Alligators are generally timid but may lose their fear of humans when fed or with repeated contact. In contrast, large crocodiles are more predatory by nature. Both species can move very fast on both land and in water, increasing the danger of attacks to small children. These species will occasionally drag victims underwater, preserving a portion of the body for later consumption. Their jaws exert the most pressure of any predator (Erickson et al. 2012), with up to 3,700 lb per square inch pressure (25.5 MPa, 255 bar, 251 ATM), causing instantaneous massive trauma to victims. All these predators produce findings in child victims similar to those seen in adults, although children may be more susceptible due to their small size and inability to defend or flee from an attack. Rarely, smaller sea life may sting or envenomate victims, causing injury or death, by either venom or secondary drowning. In all these animal attacks, the findings at autopsy are similar to those in adults. With the wide variety of animals and predators throughout the world, forensic pathologists should be aware of regional species that may cause injury and death.",

There are striking regional differences in postmortem scavenging activity, and forensic pathologists should be aware of local scavenging patterns. Forensic pathologists and investigators should also be aware that household pets often are involved in postmortem predation (Buschmann et al. 2011).\n\n",

            "text": "Game-playing asphyxial deaths occur primarily in older children and young adolescents (Le and Macnab 2001; Andrew et al. 2009). Widely termed the \u201cchoking game\u201d within the literature and community, this activity usually involves a form of strangulation to achieve a brief period of euphoria. Strangulation may be achieved by use of hands, ligature, or noose and may be self-administered or done by others. Rarely, a variant of chest compression produces the asphyxial state. The resulting cerebral hypoxia is reported as a \u201chigh\u201d with light-headedness or a few seconds of unconsciousness. With release of external neck compression, a \u201crush\u201d or \u201ctingling\u201d is described among children experiencing this activity. This activity is commonly known among preadolescents and goes by over 75 local variations in both name and activity (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) 2010; Macnab et al. 2009) and is seen throughout the world (Noirhomme-Renard and Gosset 2011). The cases presenting to a forensic service usually involve solo-game playing and are often initially thought to be suicidal hanging deaths (Andrew and Fallon 2007). The physical findings at autopsy are similar to other strangulation or hanging deaths (Figs. 27.32 and 27.33), and the key to recognition is within the scene and death investigation (Fig. 27.34). The activity is usually hidden from adults, but is widely acknowledged among peers, who usually regard the activity as a safe, drug-free \u201chigh,\u201d a part of thrill-seeking activity and risk-taking behavior of early adolescence. There are no indications of suicide at the scene or by history, and there is no evidence of autoerotic activity. The incident usually occurs in a private location that the child regards as safe, often within a home or school. The children are often \u201cgood kids,\u201d without behavioral, mental health, school, or drug/alcohol use problems. There are minimal gender differences in most studies, although some studies show a male predominance. In the USA, it is more common in Hispanic and Native American/Alaskan Native populations as compared to Caucasian populations (Toblin et al. 2008). Key to recognition at the scene is the \u201cprivate yet safe\u201d location, the simplicity of the noose, absence of suspension, and facile ability to self-extricate from the compressing object (Fig. 27.34), which usually is a simple loop against which youngsters lean. There are often wear marks on hooks or furniture from previous episodes or historical incidences of syncopal episodes, voice changes, new onset headaches, abrasions on the neck, disorientation after time alone, or accessing various electronic activities (websites, blogs, chat rooms) for asphyxial games. The absence of suicidal ideation, depression, or farewell messages is also important to ascertain. Invariably, peers will either acknowledge similar past group or individual \u201cgame playing\u201d or confirm that the victim sought information about game-playing asphyxia. Although some describe this as a new risk, it may be a continuum of asphyxial games of past preadolescent generations, such as \u201cbreath holding\u201d or hyperventilation to achieve momentary alterations of consciousness. The recent deadly inclusion of ligatures and nooses greatly increases the potential for death, especially when children engage in this activity alone.\n\n\n",

Numerous petechial hemorrhages, some confluent, are present in the sclera, conjunctiva, and the periorbital skin. Retraction of the eyelid may be necessary to fully appreciate the presence and extent of petechial hemorrhages. Petechial hemorrhages are caused by rupture of small vascular channels, usually venules, and are often present in cases of asphyxia, classically above the point of compression where venous return is compromised.
