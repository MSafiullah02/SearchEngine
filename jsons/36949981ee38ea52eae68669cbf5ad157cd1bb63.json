Data from recent studies suggest 25%-70% carriers of SARS-CoV-2 can be asymptomatic or show very limited symptoms (11, 12) . Therefore, the efficiency of COVID-19 detection or testing is critical. Accurate detection not only helps isolate the infected patients, but it also allows accurate documentation of the infection and fatality rate.

To overcome this challenge, the detection strategies (Covid19 testing) follow an efficient algorithm. The probability of the spread of the infection from one particular individual gradually decreased from the closecontacts (persons who are close, or came close to the infected individual) to the far-contacts (persons who were physically distant from the infected individual). The probability of the spread of the infection approaches to zero for someone who is located at a large distance from the infected individual. Therefore the detection of COVID-19 infection is largely performed by a contact tracing method, mostly to maximize the efficiency of detection. In this method, when a patient (symptomatic or asymptomatic) is tested positive, all the people who came close to that person in the last 10-14 days are tested with the highest priority. Thus the detection algorithm is optimized by adapting the same pattern of the infectionspreading (see supplementary note Q1).",

Conceptually, countries, where a large fraction of the screened people have been found to be contracted with the disease (SARS-CoV-2 positive), have insufficient data to accurately calculate their fatality rate. The observed fatality rates in such countries could be overestimations and may fall within a broad range as well. In contrast, countries that have found most of the screened suspects to be negative for the disease (SARS-CoV-2 negative) have higher odds of converging into the accurate estimation of the fatality rate. The fitted value of \u03b4 0 suggest that the true case fatality of COVID-19 mathematically converges to 0.8% (\u03b4 0 = 0.8 \u00b1 0.6) with relatively small uncertainty (Figure 2b ).

Hence, the fatality rate may not be exactly the same for each and every country. For instance, the observed fatality rate of Italy would be expected around 5% from equation 7, but it is >12% in practice due to several other factors. In contrast, the observed fatality is lower than expected in Brazil. Although these variations are expected from the uncertainty equations, the accurate values for individual countries cannot be estimated using this model. An important question, which should arise in this context is whether the CFR reflects the true severity of the disease. As there is a time lag between recovery and death, the CRF may keep changing throughout the epidemic in each country and saturate to a final value to the end. To address that, additional considerations might be needed to account for the time delay between disease onset and death (or recovery) from COVID19 to assess the actual clinical severity of the disease. For that, one can also look at the fatality rate in closed cases (CCFR), which takes the relative speed between death and recovery into considerations. At a given time point CCFR is generally found to be higher than CRF due to the long time delay between infection and recovery (figure 3a, supplementary information figure S2) . A fitting of CCFR with a similar method results in a global fatality rate of around 3% (\u03b4 0 = 2.7 \u00b1 0.3). The CCFR is expected to gradually decrease and saturate the same value of CFR at the end of the pandemic. Thus, at any time point, both of these time-sensitive indices may inaccurately represent the clinical severity. Yet, they provide a reliable window for the true fatality range which gradually decreases with the duration of the pandemic (figure 3b). This range of uncertainty would gradually decrease with time as the pandemic progresses.",

If it is assumed that most of the undetected patients recover from a mild or asymptomatic infection, then the current observed rate of recovery would also be an underestimation. According to the model discussed above, the outbreak size can be estimated as a function of using equation 1-4 ( Figure 1b) .

So, in conclusion, the analytical approach presented in this letter shows that the widely variable observed fatality rate is a function of the testing rate, or the average tests performed per case (see supplementary note Q3). However, the true case fatality rate is a constant between 1-3% in most of the countries. The methodology described here could be useful to estimate the true size of the infected population, which otherwise largely remains unknown. The accuracy of this simple mathematical approach can be improved further with additional parameters in future studies. This study shows a strategy to reliably distill the data from various countries into a coherent mathematical formulation to estimate the global risk of dying from the COVID19 pandemic.",
