Most patients presented with respiratory infections that progressed to severe pneumonia and dyspnea [1]. By August 6, there are 132 human infections, with 43 fatal, identified in 10 provinces on mainland of China, and one imported case was also found in Taiwan. It is an urgency to establish animal models for this virus to evaluate drug or vaccines, and lay the foundation for further pathogenic mechanism research. In this study, BALB/c mouse and ferret (Mustela putorius furo) models were chosen for animal model establishment for H7N9 virus.",

Female 6-week-old specific pathogen-free BALB/c mice used in this study were obtained from the Institute of Laboratory Animal Sciences, Beijing, China. Mice were anesthetized and inoculated intranasally with 50 \u03bcl of A/Anhui/1/2013 (H7N9) virus. Three groups of ten mice were septely inoculated with 108, 107, or 106 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) of H7N9 virus, and were observed daily for signs of disease and mortality up to 14 days. The percentages of mice that survived during the observation period were shown in Figure 1A. All of the mice inoculated with 106 TCID50 of virus survived. In contrast, only 80% and 40% of the mice inoculated with 107 or 108 TCID50 of virus survived on 14 d.p.i. For mice inoculated with 106 TCID50 of virus, the loss of body weight was observed from 2 d.p.i. and the peak loss reached 28.9% on 9 d.p.i., after which the mice began to steadily regain their body weight over the remaining observation period (Figure 1B and Table 1). Meanwhile, ruffled fur appeared from 3 d.p.i. and the occurrence rate reached 100% from 4 d.p.i. until 14 d.p.i.(Figure 2A (i) and Table 1). Furthermore, thirty mice were also inoculated with 106 TCID50 of H7N9 virus, and six were selected randomly and euthanized on 1, 2, 3, 5, 7 d.p.i. respectively for virus dissemination and pathology analysis. From 3 to 7 d.p.i., gross examination of the lungs revealed focal to multifocal consolidation in all inoculated mice (Figure 2A (ii)). However, gross examination of the heart, liver, spleen, kidney and brain did not reveal lesions in inoculated mice.",

Ferrets have been used in influenza research since 1933 because they are susceptible to infection with human and avian influenza viruses [7]. After inoculation with human influenza A virus, ferrets develop respiratory disease and lung pathology similar to that observed in humans [8]. In this study, nine specific pathogen-free castrated adult ferrets, 6 to 12 months of age that were serologically negative by HI assay for currently circulating influenza viruses, were randomly divided into two groups. One group included three ferrets, which were inoculated intranasally with 108 TCID50 of A/Anhui/1/2013 (H7N9) virus, were used for taking chest radiographs daily. Another group included left six ferrets, which were inoculated intranasally with 106 TCID50 of A/Anhui/1/2013 (H7N9) virus. Two randomly selected animals were euthanized septely on 3 and 7 d.p.i., and used for pathological and virological examination of the trachea, lung, brain, heart, liver, spleen, kidney, stomach, intestine, and olfactory bulb. All nine animals were observed for clinical signs and weighed daily as an indicator of disease. Nasal and throat swabs were collected on 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 d.p.i. and transferred to 1 ml of phosphate buffer solution (PBS). Virus titers were determined by end-point titration in MDCK cells.",

A resolution of approximately 70.74 \u03bc/pixel was achieved.",
