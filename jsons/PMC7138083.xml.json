            "text": "In the late 1980s, when innovators first began using non-invasive ventilation in patients with acute respiratory failure as a potential alternative to endotracheal intubation,1 few clinicians would have thought that within 20 years this technique would become a first-line intervention for some forms of acute respiratory failure.2 Non-invasive ventilation refers to the delivery of mechanical ventilation with techniques that do not need an invasive endotracheal airway. It should not, therefore, be used when patients cannot protect their airway. It is not appropriate for all, and the selection of candidates is important (panel 1\n). For patients with secretion accumulation or a weak cough reflex, adequate secretion management with manual or mechanical techniques might be advisable before non-invasive ventilation is declared failed or contraindicated.2, 3 Compared with invasive mechanical ventilation, this type of ventilation achieves the same physiological benefits of reduced work of breathing and improved gas exchange.4 Furthermore, it avoids the complications of intubation and the increased risks of ventilator-associated pneumonia and sinusitis, especially in patients who are immunosuppressed or with comorbidities.2\nPanel 1Indications and contraindications for NIV in acute care\nIndications\n\nBedside observations\n\n\u2022Increased dyspnoea\u2014moderate to severe\u2022Tachypnoea (>24 breaths per min in obstructive, >30 per min in restrictive)\u2022Signs of increased work of breathing, accessory muscle use, and abdominal paradox\n\nGas exchange\n\n\u2022Acute or acute on chronic ventilatory failure (best indication), PaCO2>45 mm Hg, pH<7\u00b735\u2022Hypoxaemia (use with caution), PaO2/FIO2 ratio<200\n\nContraindications\n\nAbsolute\n\n\u2022Respiratory arrest\u2022Unable to fit mask\n\nRelative\n\n\u2022Medically unstable\u2014hypotensive shock, uncontrolled cardiac ischaemia or arrhythmia, uncontrolled copious upper gastrointestinal bleeding\u2022Agitated, uncooperative\u2022Unable to protect airway\u2022Swallowing impairment\u2022Excessive secretions not managed by secretion clearance techniques\u2022Multiple (ie, two or more) organ failure\u2022Recent upper airway or upper gastrointestinal surgery\n",

Furthermore, endotracheal intubation is uncomfortable for patients and increases the need for sedation and analgesia, which is an independent factor for extended weaning.18 During non-invasive ventilation, the need for sedation is usually less than with intubation so that patients maintain better spontaneous breathing, can wean more rapidly, and spend less time in the intensive care units.19 However, it should not be used in patients with contraindications (panel 1). Such patients need prompt intubation and inadvisable use places them at risk of need for emergency intubation with its attendant morbidity and mortality.20\n",

However, such ventilation can be started too early\u2014ie, when the patient's illness is so mild that no ventilatory assistance is needed and they are more likely to be intolerant than be helped.24 Thus judgment should be exercised; most practitioners seek evidence of increased dyspnoea and work of breathing (tachypnoea or heightened accessory muscle use).25 Another advantage of an early start is that patients who are not in immediate life-threatening situations can be managed outside the intensive care units, provided that the ward team has the necessary skills. Hence specialised units (ie, respiratory intensive care, high-dependency) are ideal for provision of non-invasive ventilation to all but the most sick patients because they offer complete non-invasive monitoring systems and higher nurse to patient ratios than are available on general wards.",

These findings led some researchers to conclude that non-invasive ventilation should not be used for extubation failure. However, only 10% of enrolled patients had COPD, perhaps predisposing to less favourable findings than seen in other studies. Furthermore, outcomes were improved in the group of controls who crossed over to non-invasive ventilation after they met criteria for respiratory failure, which suggests that some patients randomly assigned to this group started too early before they were clearly good candidates. Although controversial, accumulating evidence suggests that this technique has a role in treatment of extubation failure, but mainly in patients with hypercapnic and congestive heart failure who are at high risk for extubation failure. Furthermore, patients should be monitored closely to avoid delays in intubation.",

During CPAP, a constant positive pressure is applied to raise functional residual capacity and open flooded alveoli in patients with cardiogenic pulmonary oedema. CPAP can lessen left ventricular transmural pressure, reducing afterload and increasing cardiac output, providing an additional rationale for use in the treatment of such patients.30, 31 CPAP can also be given via a helmet, which can cause difficulties with synchrony between the patient and ventilator when used with forms of positive-pressure ventilation that need triggering by the patient.90\n",

They concluded that non-invasive ventilation was very cost-effective. Plant and co-workers110 reported that when implemented on a ward, this technique reduces costs (by avoiding admission to intensive care) and improves outcomes compared with traditional medical treatment. Furthermore, the reduced rate of ventilator-associated pneumonia achieved with non-invasive ventilation not only offers clinical benefits for patients but also might have financial advantages for hospitals. For example, the cost of respiratory failure complicated by ventilator-associated pneumonia is very high, which creates a strong financial incentive for hospitals to prevent this potentially life-threatening and expensive complication.111\n",

Furthermore, because intensive care units are often full, use of this technique in other settings is becoming common in many hospitals, but patients should be selected carefully to assure safety. We expect expanded use of non-invasive ventilation as new applications are explored and caregivers develop skill in the technique, but caution should be exercised to restrict use to appropriate applications (ie, avoiding patients with contraindications or excessive delays in intubation). Much variability exists between institutions in how often, with which mode, and in which setting this technique is applied and efforts should be made to ensure that acquisition of skills helps to narrow these differences.",
