Hence, extrapolation from the documented literature of other RNA viruses causing connective tissue diseases is our best estimate of how the COVID\u201019 virus could affect the rheumatic system. Previous study evaluated the patterns of cross\u2010reaction of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)\u2010CoV antigen and antibodies in connective tissue diseases. The patients with systemic lupus erythematosus, systemic sclerosis, mixed connective tissue disease, and rheumatoid arthritis, all showed cross reactions.\n2\n False\u2010positive antibody tests were present in samples collected from patients with autoimmune diseases with rheumatic associations. Hence, it is reasonable to keep in mind that there may be a flare of the symptoms of these diseases, including the rheumatologic manifestations.",

The mechanisms postulated for this are either posttranslational modification of peptides, \u201cmolecular mimicry\u201d activating T cells or \u201cepitope spreading,\u201d due to direct or T\u2010cell associated damage by the virus leading to autoreactive T cells.\n1\n Bystander activation of T cells due to inflammatory cytokines released by the virus may also occur. Numerous studies in the literature have shown the onset of new RA or reactivation of arthritis in patients known to be in remission, post a viral infection. The COVID\u201019 infection may lead to the same. As with other single\u2010strand RNA viruses like HIV, polymyositis, and fibromyalgia may also occur with the COVID\u201019 infection.\n3\n Viral arthritis, a self\u2010limiting polyarthritis, may also occur with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection. Chronic, widespread musculoskeletal pain as occurs post SARS syndrome is a possibility with COVID\u201019.",

It is also noteworthy to mention that patients with rheumatic disease are more susceptible to the COVID\u201019 virus either because of the rheumatologic disease itself or the medications used to treat their underlying disease.",
