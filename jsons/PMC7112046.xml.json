The causative agent, PRRS virus (PRRSV), belongs to the Arterivirus genus of the Arteriviridae family, together with equine arteritis virus (EAV), lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus (LDV) and simian hemorrhagic fever virus (SHFV) (Cavanagh, 1997). The PRRSV is divided into two major genotypes, genotype 1 (European) and genotype 2 (North American) (Nelson et al., 1993). Clinically, the viruses of the two genotypes cause a similar syndrome although they share only approximately 60% nucleotide identity of the genome (Meng et al., 1995, Nelson et al., 1993). In China, a highly pathogenic PRRSV (HP-PRRSV) of genotype 2 was recognized to cause atypical PRRS outbreaks in the pig-producing areas in 2006 (Tian et al., 2007, Zhou and Yang, 2010). A recent investigation indicated that the HP-PRRSV has become the dominating virus circulating in pig farms during the past years (Zhou et al., 2014).",

            "text": "The PRRSV genome is a single strand positive RNA with approximately 15 kb in length, which encodes at least ten open reading frames (ORFs) comprising of ORF1a, ORF1b, ORF2a, ORF2b, ORFs3\u20137 and the newly discovered ORF5a (Conzelmann et al., 1993, Firth et al., 2011, Johnson et al., 2011, Snijder and Meulenberg, 1998). ORF1a and ORF1b, the replicase-associated genes, encode two polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab, respectively. The pp1a is predicated to be cleaved into ten non-structural proteins (Nsps) including Nsp1\u03b1, Nsp1\u03b2, Nsp2 to Nsp6, Nsp7\u03b1, Nsp7\u03b2 and Nsp8 (den Boon et al., 1995, Fang and Snijder, 2010, Snijder and Meulenberg, 1998, van Aken et al., 2006), whereas the pp1ab can be cleaved into four Nsps, Nsp9, Nsp10, Nsp11 and Nsp12, which are considered to be involved in viral replication and genomic transcription (Snijder and Meulenberg, 1998, van Dinten et al., 1996, Wassenaar et al., 1997). The transframe fusion (TF) in Nsp2-coding region was recently discovered (Fang et al., 2012). In recent years, a growing number of studies have paid much attention to the pathogenesis involved by the Nsps of PRRSV. The Nsp1, Nsp2, Nsp4 and Nsp11 of PRRSV have been shown to inhibit the induction of type I interferon and modulate host innate immune response (Beura et al., 2010, Han et al., 2013, Kim et al., 2010, Sun et al., 2010, Sun et al., 2012). Moreover, the Nsp1\u03b2 of PRRSV was shown to interact with the cellular poly(C)-binding protein (PCBP) 1 and 2, and this interaction could facilitate viral replication and RNA transcription (Beura et al., 2011, Wang et al., 2012). A latest study indicated that the PRRSV Nsp4 could induce apoptosis dependent on its 3C-like serine protease activity (Tripp et al., 2013).",

The SDD motif of Nsp9 has been recognized to be critical for its polymerase activity and virus transcription (Zhou et al., 2011). In addition to its polymerase activity, the interaction between Nsp9 and the host cellular proteins that affect viral replication is poorly understood although a recent study revealed that Nsp9 could interact with endogenous annexin A2 in PRRSV-infected MARC-145 cells (J. Li et al., 2014). Moreover, our recent publication has shown that Nsp9 and Nsp10 together not only affected the HP-PRRSV replication and growth in vitro and in vivo, but also contributed to its fatal virulence for piglets (Y. Li et al., 2014). Thus, further exploring the interaction of Nsp9 with host cellular protein (s) is essential for understanding the roles of Nsp9 in the replication and pathogenesis of HP-PRRSV.",

The proteins that bind to pRb have been recognized to share a conserved motif\u2014LxCxE (Dahiya et al., 2000), which was first identified in the oncoproteins of DNA tumor viruses (Boyer et al., 1996, White and Khalili, 2006, Whyte et al., 1988). Some proteins of RNA viruses have been shown to bind to pRb through this motif. The interaction between the Rubella virus Nsp9 and pRb could affect viral replication (Forng and Atreya, 1999). In coronavirus, the endoribonuclease Nsp15 could bind to pRb, resulting in the acceleration of cell cycle progression (Bhardwaj et al., 2012). Interestingly, the NS5B of hepatitis C virus (HCV), an RdRp, could interact with pRb and down-regulated the pRb level (Munakata et al., 2005, Munakata et al., 2007). In the present study, we explored the interaction between the Nsp9 of genotype 2 PRRSV and pRb and analyzed the effect of this interaction on viral replication in vitro.",

We aligned the amino acid sequences of the Nsp9 among 17 representative strains of genotype 2 PRRSV and found that the Nsp9 of all the analyzed viruses shared an identical LxCxE motif\u2014LACAE (\nTable 2). To analyze whether the Nsp9 of genotype 2 PRRSV interacts with pRb through the LACAE motif, the recombinant lentiviruses that were expressing Nsp9-GFP, Nsp9 (L415A/C417A)\u2013GFP and Nsp9 (E419K)\u2013GFP were constructed. MARC-145 cells were transduced with the lentiviruses and the cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with an anti-GFP mAb, and were then detected with an anti-pRb mAb by Co-IP assay. The GFP-expressing lentiviruses were used as the control. As shown in\nFig. 1A, the endogenous pRb could be probed in the cells that were expressing Nsp9-GFP and Nsp9 (L415A/C417A)\u2013GFP, whereas it could not be examined in the cells that were expressing Nsp9 (E419K)\u2013GFP, indicating that Nsp9 interacts with pRb and the third conserved residue (E) of the LACAE motif plays a crucial role in sustaining the interaction between Nsp9 and pRb. To further confirm the interaction of Nsp9 with the exogenous pRb, HEK 293T cells were co-transfected with the Myc-pRb-tru-expressing plasmid together with the HA-Nsp9-, HA-Nsp9 (L415A/C417A)- or HA-Nsp9 (E419K)-expressing plasmids, and Co-IP assays were performed. The similar results were obtained (Fig. 1B). Our results suggest that the LACAE motif indeed plays a critical role in the interaction between the viral Nsp9 and pRb.",

To further confirm this effect, MARC-145 cells were individually transfected with three different siRNAs specific for the pRb gene. Western blotting analysis showed that the pRb level in MARC-145 cells was effectively down-regulated by these siRNA compared with the cells transfected with the control (siCon) siRNA (Figs. 3B and C). One pair of siRNA (sipRb2) was used for subsequent experiment. The MARC-145 cells silenced with sipRb2 were infected with the virus and the virus titers were measured. The results showed that the virus titers of the sipRb2-silenced group were significantly higher than those of the control (siCon) group (p<0.001 or p<0.01) (Fig. 3D), indicating that silencing the pRb gene in MARC-145 cells facilitate the viral replication.

Compared with the GFP-expressing cells, the pRb level was significantly down-regulated in the Nsp9-expressing cells, whereas it recovered when the cells were treated with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (\nFig. 5A), indicating that the Nsp9 of genotype 2 PRRSV promotes the degradation of pRb. To consolidate this finding, HEK 293T cells were co-transfected with a dose-dependent increasing Nsp9 and dose-constant pRb-tru, and the pRb-tru level was examined by western blotting. The results showed that the pRb-tru level reduced gradually as the Nsp9 level increased, and it recovered in the cells treated with MG132 (Fig. 5B), indicating that the Nsp9 of genotype 2 PRRSV can down-regulate the pRb abundance by ubiquitin proteasome pathway.",

            "text": "A study on mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) showed that the viral protein production was delayed at the presence of the pRb overexpression (Bhardwaj et al., 2012). Our results found that the overexpression of exogenous pRb-tru significantly decreased the replication of genotype 2 PRRSV in MARC-145 cells, and silencing the pRb gene obviously increased the viral replication in MARC-145 cells, suggesting that pRb might function as a restriction factor that inhibits the replication of genotype 2 PRRSV. Similar to HCV (Munakata et al., 2007), our data indicated that the pRb had a reduced level in PRRSV-infected MARC-145 cells, inferring that the decrease of the pRb abundance is likely required for the replication of PRRSV. The pRb has been shown to regulate the cell cycle and the pRb-E2F pathway plays a vital role in cell cycle progression. Previous studies in some RNA viruses have shown that the interaction of viral proteins with pRb could alter the cell cycle progression to create favorable cellular environment that is beneficial for viral replication (Nelson and Tang, 2006, Pietschmann et al., 2001, Scholle et al., 2004). Thus, we propose that the interaction between the Nsp9 of genotype 2 PRRSV and pRb might modulate the pRb-E2F pathway and altered the cell cycle progression which affects the viral replication. Further investigation for this issue will be required.",

            "text": "Viruses can encode some proteins to degrade the restrictive factors of host and to counteract their inhibition activities on viruses by utilizing ubiquitin proteasome pathway. The E6 of human papillomavirus has been shown to degrade the tumor suppressor p53 through ubiquitin proteasome pathway (Freedman and Levine, 1998). The Vif of human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) and the Vpx of HIV and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) have been indicated to target APOBEC3G and HD domain-containing protein-1 (SAMHD1) for proteasomal degradation, separately (Ahn et al., 2012, Hrecka et al., 2011, Kobayashi, 2005). Our results clearly showed that the Nsp9 of PRRSV could promote the degradation of pRb by the ubiquitin\u2013proteasome pathway. Thus, we suggest that the ubiquitinational degradation of pRb might be an important mechanism for the PRRSV Nsp9 to counteract the pRb function. The E3 ubiquitin ligase has been recognized as an important component of ubiquitin\u2013proteasome pathway (Ciechanover, 1994). Similar to HCV NS5B and CoV-SARS Nsp15 (Bhardwaj et al., 2012, Munakata et al., 2007), we observed that pRb altered its distribution and co-localization with Nsp9 of PRRSV in the cytoplasm following PRRSV infection. Thus, we propose a model that Nsp9 recruited pRb to E3 ligases and modulated E3 ligases dependent degradation of pRb by proteasome pathway in the cytoplasm. It needs to be done to clarify the exact mechanism of the pRb degradation.",
