We aimed to evaluate the outcome in hypertensive patients with COVID-19 and its relation to the use of renin-angiotensin system blockers (RASB). Methods: We have systematically searched the medical database up to March 27, 2020 and retrieved all the published articles in English language related to our topic using MeSH key words. Results: From the pooled data of all ten available Chinese studies (n \u00bc 2209) that have reported the characteristics of comorbidities in patients with COVID-19, hypertension was present in nearly 21%, followed by diabetes in nearly 11%, and established cardiovascular disease (CVD) in approximately 7% of patients. Although the emerging data hints to an increase in mortality in COVID-19 patients with known hypertension, diabetes and CVD, it should be noted that it was not adjusted for multiple confounding factors. Harm or benefit in COVID-19 patients receiving RASB has not been typically assessed in these studies yet, although mechanistically and plausibly both, benefit and harm is possible with these agents, given that COVID-19 expresses to tissues through the receptor of angiotensin converting enzyme-2. Conclusion: Special attention is definitely required in patients with COVID-19 with associated comorbidities including hypertension, diabetes and established CVD. Although the role of RASB has a mechanistic equipoise, patients with COVID-19 should not stop these drugs at this point of time, as recommended by various world organizations and without the advice of health care provider.",

As of March 27, 2020, world has witnessed more than half a million cases of COVID-19 with more than 24,000 deaths [2] . This suggests the magnitude of its spread across the world, since it was first reported on December 31, 2019 from Wuhan, Hubei province in China. Emerging data suggests that older COVID-19 patients with other comorbid conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, cardiac and pulmonary disease are in particular more susceptible, compared to general populations and have higher mortality. Therefore, it is necessary to re-look into these subgroups of COVID-19 patients with associated comorbidities.",

            "text": "While consistent association of hypertension in patients with COVID-19 across all these studies is unique, the concern which needs a serious attention is the increase in mortality. Two Chinese studies have worked in this direction to-date. In 191 patients with COVID-19, Zhou et al. found hypertension to have an odds ratio (OR) of 3.05 (95% CI, 1.57 to 5.92; p < 0.006), diabetes with OR of 2.85 (95% CI, 1.35 to 6.05; p < 0.001), whereas presence of coronary artery disease had an OR of 21.40 (95% CI, 4.64 to 98.76; p < 0.0001) for in-hospital mortality, in an univariate analysis [8] . However, the association between these disorders and COVID-19 mortality were no longer significant after a multivariate regression analysis. Similarly, in an analysis of 201 patients with COVID-19, Wu et al. found hypertension to have a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.82 (95% CI, 1.13 to 2.95; p \u00bc 0.01) for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and 1.70 (95% CI, 0.92 to 3.14, p \u00bc 0.09) for death. The diabetic patients had a HR of 2.34 (95% CI, 1.35 to 4.05; p \u00bc 0.002) for ARDS and HR of 1.58 (95% CI, 0.80 to 3.13, p \u00bc 0.19) for death, in a bivariate cox regression analysis [11] . It should be noted however, that neither of these studies were adjusted for all confounding variables. Nevertheless, a study of 187 patients with COVID-19, Guo et al. reported nearly a twice increase in mortality in patients with established CVD and raised troponin T (TnT), compared to patients without CVD and raised TnT (69.4% vs. 37.5% respectively) [14] .",

            "text": "The entry of coronavirus into the cell is facilitated by the spike (S) protein. Before attachment to the receptor on host cell, the S protein needs to be primed by a serine protease named TMPRSS2. The S proteins of different coronaviruses may utilise different receptors; MERS utilises CD26 while SARS CoV and SARS CoV2 utilise Angiotensin Converting Enzyme-2 (ACE-2) [23] . The efficiency of the interaction between S-protein and ACE-2 may be a key determinant of the transmissibility of the virus, viral replication and the severity of disease. In theory, this efficiency could be influenced by changes or amino acid substitutions in either the viral S-protein or [24] . The major outbreak of SARS CoV occurred in 2002e2003 with a minor localised outbreak with mild symptoms in 2003e2004. It was observed that the S-protein of SARS CoV in the 2002e2003 outbreak bound to ACE-2 receptor much more efficiently than that of SARS CoV in the 2003e2004 outbreak, consistent with the absence of human-to-human transmission during the latter outbreak. Several molecular changes in the S-protein influence the binding with human ACE-2; for example, the substitution of threonine by serine at position 487 in S protein reduces the binding [25] . Similarly, asparagine at position 479 increased the binding affinity [26] . Methylation at position 487 has also been shown to influence binding. Recently, S-protein of SARS CoV2 has been shown to be similar to that of SARS CoV, barring a few gains of function mutations. The most important of these is a glutamine at position 493 at the receptor binding domain, which explains its increased transmissibility compared to SARS CoV [27] . b) Changes in ACE-2 Receptor: With regard to MERS-CoV, which employs CD26 (DPP-4) as its receptor for cellular entry, there are naturally-occurring polymorphisms in DPP4 that impact cellular entry of MERS-CoV and might thus modulate MERS development in infected patients [28] . There is a possibility that similar variations or polymorphisms in ACE-2 could affect the viral entry and disease course. Polymorphisms of ACE-2 gene have been identified; however, there is no evidence that they affect susceptibility to or severity of SARS CoV2 infection [29] . A recent study found differential ACE-2 gene expression in human lung tissue with no racial/gender differences, but a higher gene expression in lungs of smokers compared to non-smokers, which could explain the higher risk of infection in smokers [30] .",

            "text": "To what extent this predisposes the elderly to infection with SARSCoV2 is not known. In a study of 187 patients with COVID-19, Guo et al. reported an increased trend in mortality with those receiving RASB, compared to those not receiving. Mortality was 36.8% (6 of 19) and 25.6% (43 of 168) in patients with or without RASB, respectively [14] . Indeed, increased association and heightened mortality with COVID-19 have been observed consistently across the studies in elderly, hypertensive, diabetics and known CVD; however, it is not exactly known whether it has any causal relation with the use of RASB or these subgroups are more on RASB due to these illness, compared to the rest of population. Moreover, there is no solid evidence to back this concern either in COVID-19 or in infection by other coronaviruses. b) Rationale and Evidence for Benefit: As discussed above, increasing ACE-2 levels in coronavirus infection could reduce lung injury. In an experimental study with mice, Kuba et al. found that losartan showed significantly diminished lung injury and pulmonary edema after acid aspiration-induced acute lung injury (with addition of SARS-CoV spike protein) compared to placebo [32] . Similarly, severe lung injury and pulmonary edema were prevented by both recombinant human ACE-2 infusions or losartan in ACE2-knockout mice [38] . Mice with coronavirus induced lung injury showed improvement when treated with losartan [39] . Moreover, a retrospective analysis found reduced rates of death and endotracheal intubation in patients with viral pneumonia who were continued on ACE inhibitors [40] . Treatment with ARBs was reported to reduce mortality in Ebola virus infection [41] . The exact mechanism of apparent benefit of these drugs in coronavirus infection is not yet clear. However, there could be several explanations [42] . i. Increased ACE-2 expression may not result in more viral entry into the cell because of the limited availability of the serine protease TMPRSS2. Camostat mesylate, which is a TMPRSS2 inhibitor, has been shown to inhibit cellular entry of SARS CoV2 and could be a potential therapeutic option [43] . ii. Increased ACE-2 expression on the cell membrane may also lead to increased soluble ACE-2 in blood, which may actually bind to most of SARS CoV2 and prevent its interaction with the membrane bound receptor. iii. RAS blockers increase angiotensin II, which is a substrate for ACE-2. The interaction of ACE-2 with angiotensin II could induce a conformational change in the receptor binding domain of ACE-2, limiting its ability to bind with SARS CoV2 [44] . iv. ACE-2 receptors are present at a much higher density in lung tissue of children and young adults, compared to older individuals. Thus, the upregulation of ACE-2 receptors by the use of RASB over time in older people may emulate ACE expression in young people. It is also possible that having more ACE-2 receptors and increased ACE-2 functions will likely produce more angiotensin (1e7) that might provide resilience against target-mediated destruction and development of pulmonary failure in patients with COVID-19 [22] . This postulated positive effects on lung can be also protective during overwhelming infection with COVID-19. v. Indiscriminate discontinuation of RASB in patients with heart failure may also lead to readmission to hospital and increase in mortality [45] .",
