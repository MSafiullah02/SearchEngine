            "text": "Infectious tracheobronchitis (kennel cough) is a clinical syndrome of dogs characterized by acute onset of a dry, hacking cough (often followed by retching or gagging on mucous secretions) (Appel and Percy, 1970, Bemis et al., 1977a, Shade and Goodnow, 1979, Azetaka and Konishi, 1988). Kennel cough can be due to a single pathogen or to a complex of bacteria and/or viruses (Appel and Percy, 1970, Bemis et al., 1977a, Appel, 1981). The primary bacterium associated with kennel cough is Bordetella bronchiseptica (Bemis et al., 1977a). Signs of infection due to B. bronchiseptica typically persist for 1\u20132 weeks, but organisms can be shed for 2\u20133 months following clinical recovery (Bemis et al., 1977a). Dogs can be resistant to re-infection for approximately 12 months following recovery (Bemis et al., 1977b). Mycoplasma spp., Pastuerella multocida, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli have been isolated from the respiratory tract of dogs and also might cause signs of kennel cough (Bemis et al., 1977b, Wagener et al., 1984). Primary viral pathogens implicated in kennel cough include canine-adenovirus type 2 and canine-parainfluenza virus (Appel and Percy, 1970, Azetaka and Konishi, 1988). Other viruses suspected of causing kennel cough include canine-adenovirus type 1, canine-herpesvirus, canine-distemper virus, and canine-reovirus types 1\u20133 (Dhein and Gorham, 1986, Appel and Binn, 1987). Transmission of pathogens associated with kennel cough is both by direct contact and indirectly by aerosolized droplets from coughing or sneezing dogs and by fomites (such as dishes, and the clothing and hands of dog handlers) (Ford and Vaden, 1990).",

Signs of kennel cough often occur within 5\u201310 days (Appel, 1981) after admission to a shelter and morbidity can be as high as 50% among susceptible dogs; mortality is usually low (Appel and Binn, 1987). A major issue for shelters is that coughing dogs might not be adoptable and might require medical care. Furthermore, signs of kennel cough might not become apparent until a dog is adopted\u2014causing concern and frustration among new owners.",

            "text": "Methods to prevent kennel cough include vaccination of dogs as soon as possible following admission to a shelter, quarantine of newly introduced dogs, isolation of sick dogs, and adequate sanitation and ventilation. Commercial vaccines are either killed or modified live for parenteral or intranasal (IN) administration. Ten to 14 days usually are required for partial immunity to develop following subcutaneous administration, and a second dose is required 2\u20134 weeks later. IN modified-live vaccines usually produce a rapid, localized (mucosal) protection (Shade and Goodnow, 1979, Bey et al., 1981, Glickman and Appel, 1981, Kontor et al., 1981) and protective immunity can develop within 4 days following a single dose (Bey et al., 1981). IN vaccination has been recommended for use during outbreaks or when exposure is imminent (such as prior to boarding, being placed in a shelter, or attending a dog show) (Appel and Binn, 1987). Shelters usually do not have adequate space to quarantine vaccinated dogs to allow protective immunity to develop or to isolate symptomatic dogs. Use of bleach solutions for cleaning cages and bedding, use of disposable gloves and dishware, diligent hand washing, and adequate ventilation/filtration to reduce the concentration of viral and bacterial particles in the environment also help to prevent the spread of kennel cough (Ford and Vaden, 1990).",

The first day at the shelter, apparently healthy dogs received either an IN vaccination containing B. bronchiseptica and canine-parainfluenza virus (Intra-Trac\u00ae II, Schering-Plough Animal Health Corporation, Omaha, NE) (IN-BP), an IN vaccine containing B. bronchiseptica and canine parainfluenza virus plus canine adenovirus (Bronchi-Shield\u00ae III, Fort Dodge Laboratories, Fort Dodge, IA) (IN-BPA), or a placebo IN (IN-P) vaccine consisting of a sterile diluent labeled as an experimental vaccine. Active vaccines were packaged in the commercially available form. All dogs admitted on a given day received the same vaccine. Dogs were housed in one of the three rooms of the shelter based on availability of kennel space on the admission date; small dogs and puppies were housed in the smallest room containing the smallest kennels. Therefore, no attempt was made to segregate unvaccinated dogs or to group dogs by admission date (and thus by vaccine). As necessary to facilitate cleaning, dogs were moved from one kennel to another during their stay in the shelter. Dogs were observed daily for coughing, sneezing, or nasal or ocular discharge, by shelter staff during activities of cleaning, feeding, and placement of new dog admissions into neighboring kennels. When these signs were observed by staff members, managers confirmed the observations and noted the signs on a reporting form. The TCHS admission date, the type of vaccine administered (by manufacturer\u2019s name), and the date of vaccine administration were recorded in each dog\u2019s written and computer records; this was the only indication that the dog was part of the study and of the vaccine it had received.",

Dogs in the study were monitored for up to 30 days post-vaccination. If a dog was adopted or redeemed from TCHS prior to 30 days, the owner was given a written description of the study, along with a chart to record any clinical signs of tracheobronchitis (such as coughing, sneezing, and nasal and ocular discharge) and the duration of these signs. The vaccines the dogs had received were noted in the shelter record by manufacturer\u2019s name, and owners received a copy of this record as part of the adoption paperwork. The owners of dogs adopted before 30 days post-vaccination were contacted by telephone 30\u201345 days following vaccination and asked about their dogs\u2019 health. Any clinical signs that occurred during the 30 days following vaccination were recorded. Two primary outcomes were possible: no coughing or coughing (whether at TCHS or at home). Secondary outcomes included signs of upper-respiratory disease (such as coughing, sneezing, and nasal or ocular discharge) during the first 3 days following vaccination, and these were considered as potential vaccine-associated adverse events. Sneezing or nasal or ocular discharge occurring within 30 days post-vaccination also was recorded.",

Prognostic factors for kennel cough were evaluated using logistic regression (odds ratios (OR)). The distributions of continuous variables were checked for log-linearity. Univariable logistic regression was used to determine OR, 95% CI of the OR, and significance values for each prognostic factor.

Our original power calculation suggested that, given 500 dogs per group at \u03b1=0.05, this study would have had a power of approximately 85% to detect a 20% difference in the incidence of coughing between dogs in the IN-P group and each of the active vaccine groups or between these two vaccine groups.

            "text": "This study had several limitations. The dogs were not randomly assigned to the three vaccine groups and the shelter staff was not formally blinded to the vaccines given. However, there were no significant differences in host or environmental characteristics at baseline among dogs in the three vaccine groups (Table 1). Although viral and bacterial cultures were performed at the start and near the conclusion of the trial, the pattern of pathogens in the shelter was not monitored throughout the trial. Some upper-respiratory signs of disease might, therefore, have been caused by pathogens for which antigens were not present in the vaccine. The finding of B. bronchiseptica before the study started confirmed that this organism was present, and at least in part responsible for the rate of coughing reported to us. The finding of canine-adenovirus months later suggests that at least in this shelter at this time, this pathogen might have contributed to clinical disease and argues in favor of trivalent vaccine use. Staff members were not blinded to the vaccines given the dogs. Because this study was not funded and used commercially packaged vaccines (each of which had a distinct appearance and delivery system), the simplest procedure was rotating-day assignment. Owners could discover the name of the manufacturer of the vaccines given to their dogs within the adoption paperwork. It is possible that the lack of blinding contributed to the small differences seen in this study. For example, if there had been an expectation that the experimental vaccine would be effective, then the increased coughing incidence in the IN-P group might actually have been under-reported\u2014leading to decreased effectiveness for the active vaccines. On the other hand, potential misclassification of coughing might have resulted in either under- or over-reporting of coughing in the other vaccine groups, again making it difficult to discern true incidence (Rothman and Greenland, 1998). Ideally, vaccines would have been packaged identically with no distinguishing characteristics and with a coding scheme for their identification. In this small municipal shelter, with a limited number of staff members and without funding, the practical solution was the field trial we conducted.",
