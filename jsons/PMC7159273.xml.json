Infectious disease crises can cause immense economic disruption. The west African countries of Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia have suffered a cumulative economic loss of at least 10% of gross domestic product (GDP) as a result of Ebola virus disease.1, 2 Zika virus is already having a substantial effect on the Caribbean tourism industry as young couples go elsewhere for their honeymoons. In its report titled The Neglected Dimension of Global Security: A Framework to Counter Infectious Disease Crises, the US National Academy of Medicine's Commission on A Global Health Risk Framework for the Future (the Commission)3 suggested that average expected economic losses from infectious disease crises might amount to over US$60 billion per year.4 This figure included only the direct economic costs. Fan and colleagues5 suggest that on a more inclusive basis, taking into account mortality costs, annual expected losses might amount to $490 billion, a staggering figure. Given the scale of these costs, pandemic prevention and response must be treated as a matter of human and economic security, not purely as a health issue.",

Using text-mining software, we screened some of the more well known or authoritative sets of reports, including the reports of IMF's Article IV consultations, Standard & Poor's sovereign rating assessments, and reports from the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU). We compared reports published in the 24 months before the first public declaration of a substantial infectious disease outbreak with reports published in the 24 months after. Where the search filters identified the use of at least one of the target search terms, we did a manual review to understand the context of the results returned.",

For example, looking at the IMF Article IV reports for the 15 countries most affected by four of the most substantial infectious disease crises in recent years (SARS, MERS, Ebola, and Zika), none mentioned the risk to economic growth posed by potential infectious disease crises before the outbreaks occurred, whereas most commented on the outbreaks' impact on economic growth after the event took place. In the EIU reports published before the relevant infectious disease outbreaks, only 23 (9%) of 247 reports mentioned the relevant search terms. However, manual review of these 23 instances reveals that most of these mentions referred to the use of terms such as epidemic in a non-infectious disease sense (eg, epidemic of violence).",

Economists who concede that such risks should be included in their macroeconomic analyses often explain their absence by saying they do not have the expertise or information to include them. To their credit, the IMF have recognised this weakness and are now talking explicitly about the need to incorporate non-economic factors such as climate change and health risks into their overall macroeconomic analyses. So how should the IMF, World Bank, and others go about including the risks from potential pandemics in their regular assessments of countries' economic stability and prospects and of the appropriateness of government policies?

There are analyses of different countries' susceptibilities to specific pathogens. For example, the World Bank produced a preliminary analysis of the potential impact of Zika virus across Latin America and the Caribbean in February, 2016.8 Some national public health agencies, such as the US Center for Disease Control, or in the UK, Public Health England, produce analyses of their own vulnerability to different infectious disease threats. But all of these analyses use different methods and formats. For the assessment of the strength of the overall health system, various potential sources exist. For example, for primary care, the Primary Health Care Performance Initiative (PHCPI) seeks to provide a comprehensive set of similar metrics.19\n",

In large countries, substantial variations in vulnerability between different regions could occur. To make the score similar across different diseases would entail making judgments on the relative probabilities and severity of different types of outbreak. Even definition of which infectious diseases to include on the matrix would involve some debate (and thought would have to be given as to how to accommodate as yet unknown diseases).

Even on this basis, less than 40% of countries assess themselves to be compliant with IHR2005.20 To build a more rigorous approach is perfectly feasible. Under the Global Health Security Agenda, a peer-based assessment process has been piloted in five countries.21 The World Organisation for Animal Health also has a well established system of external assessment of performance against the Terrestrial Animal Health Code. These initiatives provide good starting points to design a more comprehensive system. The conclusions of the Review Committee of the Role of the IHR2005, which will shortly be reported to the World Health Assembly, will be immensely important in shaping the way forward. The Review Committee was tasked to recommend steps to improve the functioning, transparency, effectiveness, and efficiency of the IHR2005.22 We hope that the committee will recommend the establishment of a robust external assessment mechanism along the lines put forward by the Commission.",

Economies that are more dependent on travel and tourism will be more vulnerable to economic disruption from potential pandemics than those focused on, for example, primary resources such as mining or energy. Working with WHO, and potentially with leaders from the relevant industries, the World Bank and IMF should be in a position to develop industry sector coefficients of vulnerability to infectious diseases (these might be crude at first, but can be refined over time). Together with existing country data on sectoral mix, these coefficients can then be used to develop an overall picture of the degree to which a country's economic activity is susceptible to infectious disease risks. As well as providing crucial input into the assessment of economic vulnerability, such an exercise could be used to engage relevant industry leaders in each sector in thinking through their own vulnerabilities and therefore their own priorities in terms of preparedness and response. Having private sector players understand more fully what is at stake and what part they must play is a vital (and often, undermanaged) part of a country's overall strategy for preparedness and response.",

The global health community should therefore work with its partners to provide these inputs, focusing in particular on a consistent approach to assessment of individual countries' intrinsic vulnerability to infectious diseases, and objective, external benchmarking of national core capabilities.
