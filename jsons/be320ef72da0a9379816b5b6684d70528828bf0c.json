A commercial PED live vaccine (strain has been used in pig farms in Northern Vietnam since 2011. Another more common immunoprophylaxis applied in the field is the artificial infection of sows (i.e., the feedback method) during pregnancy using pooled faeces and intestine collected from infected piglets (Song, Moon, & Kang, 2015) . However, the effectiveness of these preventive measurements in the field is questionable because PED still occurred and frequently recurred in pig farms in which vaccination or the feedback method was applied. The persistence and reoccurrence of PED have been becoming more common in infected farms. To date, PEDV continues to spread widely and cause severe economic losses for the national swine industry.

We also detected one novel variant with an 8-amino acid insertion located in the receptor-binding region for porcine aminopeptidase N. Compared to the commercial vaccine strains, the emerging Vietnamese strains were genetically distant and had various amino acid differences in epitope regions and N-glycosylation sites in the S protein.

Majority of Vietnamese strains in our study belonged to G2-2, which comprised 17 of 25 current Vietnamese strains along with high virulent non-S INDEL strains identified in North America and Asia. Excluding VN97/HN/2013 and VN344/HN/2014 in this subgroup, which were closely clustered with Chinese strains, 15 other Vietnamese strains were grouped closest to North American non-S INDEL strains identified in US, Mexico, Canada, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan (Chiou et al., 2015; Suzuki et al., 2015; Vlasova et al., 2014). Notably, three Vietnamese strains, namely VN01/HY/2013, VN12/HY/2013 and VN385/TB/2014, were most closely related to three Japanese strains (AOM-3/JPN/2014, 14JM126, 14JM226) and two US strains (USA/Minnesota90/2013, NPL-PEDv/2013), and they formed a monophyletic branch. The remaining 12 Vietnamese strains were grouped in a segregated branch, and they were most closely related to the Japanese strain AOM-2/JPN/2014 and US strain USA/Minnesota/271/2014 (US). Six PEDV Vietnamese strains in our study were included in subgroup G2-1. Four of these strains (VN292/HN/ 2014, VN367/VP/2014, VN-K2/HY/2015 and VN-TH15/HY/2015) formed a monophyletic branch, and they were closely related to the previously reported Vietnamese strains HUA-PED45 and HUA-PED47 (Kim, Lim et al., 2015). The other Vietnamese strain in this subgroup, namely VN02/HY/2013, was closely grouped with reference strains recently isolated in Japan (13JM-291), Thailand (BRC2) and Vietnam (VN/VAP1113_1/2013/VungTau, VN/KCHY_310113/ 2013/KhoaiChau and VN/JFP1013_1/2013/VinhAn).", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF2": {"text": ". The length of the S gene of Vietnamese PEDVs was more diverse than that of PEDVs identified in China (4,146-4,170 nucleotides)(Chen et al.,   2013), Korea (4,161 nucleotides)(Kim, Lee et al., 2015), Japan and USA (4,152-4,161 nucleotides). Compared to the S gene (4,152 nucleotides) of prototype strain CV777, the S genes of most (18/25) Vietnamese strains were 9 nucleotides longer, consisting of 4,161 nucleotides, and the S gene of one field strain was 9 nucleotide shorter (4,143 nucleotides). The S genes of four field strains consisted of 4,152 nucleotides, that of one field strain was 6 nucleotides longer (4,158 nucleotides) and that of one field strain was 30 nucleotides longer (4,182 nucleotides). These changes were due to the presence of four deletions (three 3-nucleotide deletions at posi-tions 327-329, 401-403 and 3578-3580 and a 6-nucleotide deletion at positions 464-469) and six insertions (three 3-nucleotide insertions between positions 163 and 164, 172 and 173 and 401 and 402; a 9-nucleotide insertion between positions 172 and 173; a 12-nucleotide insertion between positions 170 and 171; acids, which is 261 amino acids shorter than expected (1,386 amino acids). This consequence was due to one nucleotide substitution (C?T) at position 3376 (Fig. S3), leading to the formation of a stop codon (TAA) at positions 3,376-3,378 in the S gene. Likewise, the S gene of the field strain VN262/HB/2014 was 4,152 nucleotides in length but encoded a protein of 1,122 amino acids due to a similar nucleotide substitution at position 3367 of the S gene. The other Vietnamese PEDV strains in our study had S proteins of 1,380-1,393 amino acids. Compared to the reference strains and other Vietnamese strains, VN-TH15/HY/2015 had a unique 8-amino acid insertion (ITGSSTTP) between positions 380 and 381 of the S protein (Fig. S2). Correspondingly, at the nucleotide level, VN-TH15/HY/2015 had a 24-nucleotide insertion (CCATCA-CAGGCAGCAGCACGACTC) between positions 1137 (C) and 1138 (A) in the S gene compared to that in CV777. Five Vietnamese strains in G2-1 (except for VN297/HB/2014) have a 1-amino acid deletion at position 1194 (Fig. S2). In comparison with the S protein of CV777, all Vietnamese strains in G2-1 and G2-2 examined in this study had insertions (a 4-amino acid insertion between positions 55 and 56 and a 1-amino acid insertion between positions 134 and 135) and a 2-amino acid deletion positions 474 and 475 in the S gene. These insertions and deletion in the S gene are typical for the S INDEL type of PEDV(Vlasova et al., 2014;Lin et al., 2016). Of note, two classical Japanese strains in G1-2 (NK and KH) do not possess these typical INDELs in the S gene.

Subsequently, the virus has spread rapidly and become more complex. PED persistence and recurrent epidemics are often observed in PEDV-infected herds. Outbreaks are also reported to occur throughout the year opposed to only in the cold season as previously reported. At present, the disease continues to widely circulate, becoming a major focus of farm owners. To better understand the prevailing PEDVs, full-length S genes of PEDVs collected from different farms in Northern Vietnam were sequenced and analysed. The sequencing results revealed variations in length and various insertions and deletions in the S gene of Vietnamese strains. Sequence homology analysis of the S gene illustrated that the Vietnamese PEDVs were genetically diverse, displaying divergence in sequence identity with each other. Moreover, all Vietnamese strains were classified into four types corresponding to four subgroups. Taken together, these results indicated the heterogeneity among prevailing PEDVs in the northern provinces of Vietnam. They also suggested the need for multiple PEDV vaccine strains for preventing PED in Vietnam because the availability of vaccine strainsthat are genetically related to circulating viruses is critical(Song et al., 2015).Prototype PEDV strains (NA non-S INDEL type) were first identified in Iowa in the US at the end of April 2013(Stevenson et al., 2013).Jarvis et al., (2016) reported that the evolution of US strains is estimated to have begun around July 2009 to August 2012.", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF6": {"text": "the 8-amino acid insertion observed in VN-TH15/HY/2015 influences the biological functions of PEDV requires further study.

Additionally, several US-like strains (including NA and new S INDEL types) identified at the beginning of 2013 in Northern Vietnam were also most closely related to Japanese PEDV strains isolated in 2014. In addition, recent studies demonstrated that the re-emerging PEDV outbreaks in Japan were caused by novel strains that were introduced from abroad (Suzuki et al., 2015; Van", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF7": {"text": "NVTN/NVTS) were promising markers of virus evolvement, as they are located in the COE region, meaning that small changes could possibly result in disturbances in the folding and conformation of the S protein.

The Vietnamese PEDV strain HUA-14PED96 (accession number KT941120), which was identified in a Northern province, was reported to have a unique 72-nucleotide deletion in the ORF1a gene(Choe et al., 2016). Consistent with the previous results, several Vietnamese PEDV strains in our study were genetically similar to the reported Vietnamese strains and re-emerging Chinese strains.Four strains in our study, namely VN292/HN/2014, VN367/VP/2014, VN-K2/HY/2015 and VN-TH15/HY/2015, were phylogenetically similar to HUA-PED45 and HUA-PED47. Notably, the four Vietnamese strains collected from three adjacent provinces formed a well-supported branch. These results indicated that these PEDV strains might have derived from a common ancestral virus, the progeny of which spread in this region. Interestingly, strain VN297/HB/ 2013 in our study was genetically most similar to HUA-14PED96, and these two strains formed a monophyletic branch. This indicated that VN297/HB/2013 might also possess the same 72-nucleotide deletion in ORF1a compared with HUA-14PED96, although more extensive genome sequencing is required to clarify this finding. In this study, we identified one novel PEDV strain, VN-TH15/HY/ 2015, with an 8-amino acid insertion between positions 380 and 381 of the S protein, which are located in the receptor-binding domain (amino acids 253-638) for porcine aminopeptidase N (Liu", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF5": {"text": "lated in a central province (Quang Tri) of Vietnam were clustered into the S INDEL type of PEDV. Consistent with those data, in this study, we identified a strain (VN232/HB/2013) belonging to this type that was collected in a northern province (Hoa Binh) of Vietnam. The result indicated that this genotype of PEDV was distributed in both the northern and central regions of the country. These Vietnamese strains were most closely related to classical strains isolated in China (JS-2004-2, LJB03 and CH7) before 2010. Therefore, these Vietnamese strains were classified as the classical S INDEL type. The data also suggested that the classical S INDEL strains prevailing in Vietnam evolved from classical Chinese S INDEL strains. Because of urgent demands, several PED vaccine strains produced in Asian countries such as P5-V (Japan), attenuated CV777 (China) and attenuated DR13 (South Korea) were considered for import into Vietnam. Phylogenetic and sequence analyses revealed that the current PEDV strains in Vietnam were genetically distant from the aforementioned vaccine strains. Antigenic analysis illustrated that compared to the vaccine strains, the circulating Vietnamese PEDVs were conserved in epitopes SS2 and 2C10 but had various substitutions in the COE domain and epitope SS6. In particular, substitutions in three positions, namely 496, 549 and 766 in the epitope regions of the S protein, were predicted to result in the formation of new phosphorylation sites.
