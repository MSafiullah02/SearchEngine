When neonates with AOP are breathing spontaneously, CPAP is sufficient to support their ventilatory effort. However, during periods of apnea, as seen in Fig. 1, no additional support is provided and the neonate is susceptible to clinically significant events (CSE) characterized by desaturations and bradycardia. Increasing support to noninvasive pressure support ventilation (NIV-PS) allows backup ventilation when no flow is detected and setting the pressure support at 0 cmH2O should provide no additional pressure support (CPAP only) during spontaneous ventilation and backup support when apneic. However, as seen in Fig. 2, the flow trigger with NIV-PS is unreliable and backup breaths occur during spontaneous respiration and the ventilator fails to provide backup support when the neonate is apneic.",

It is delivered with the Servo-I/U ventilator (Getinge, Germany) with NIV NAVA software. A specialized nasogastric tube is placed at the level of the crural diaphragm and embedded electrodes detect the electrical activity of the diaphragm (Edi). Positive pressure is then delivered for the duration of, and in proportion to, the amount of electrical activity detected. The NAVA level is a proportionality constant that converts the Edi into a delivered inspiratory pressure above PEEP [6]. If the neonate becomes apneic for a predetermined amount of time (apnea time), pressure control backup ventilation is provided until spontaneous ventilation, as detected by the Edi, resumes. Setting the NAVA level at 0 cmH2O/mcV when on NIV NAVA (NN0), as seen in Fig. 3, has been proposed as an alternate method to deliver CPAP with backup ventilation in neonates who are failing CPAP due to AOP [5, 7].",

CSE were defined as apnea lasting more than 20 s, apnea for more than 10 s accompanied by bradycardia (<80 bpm), or desaturation (<90%). When switched to NN0, PEEP remained at the previous CPAP pressure level and the Servo-I/U delivers a PIP of 2 cmH20 above PEEP for each spontaneous breath. Backup settings, which included backup PIP, pressure limit, and apnea time, were chosen by the treating physician. CSE were collected retrospectively from the nurses\u2019 electronic data charting, for 24 h on nCPAP and then for the following 24 h on NN0. Demographic data and ventilator settings were collected. Paired t-test was used to compare the number of CSE on CPAP versus NN0.",

This approach may have the benefit of reducing CSE while minimizing exposure to noninvasive ventilation and reducing associated morbidities of noninvasive ventilation.",

The neonates therefore are actually receiving PEEP plus 2 cmH20 for each spontaneous breath, the set PIP for each backup breath and set PEEP in between all these breaths. It is therefore possible that the overall benefit of NN0 is to deliver a slightly higher mean airway pressure and it is this increased pressure that causes the decrease in CSE and not the backup ventilation that is provided when the neonates are apneic.

It was not possible to evaluate the number of times the neonate went into backup ventilation and the amount of time spent in backup during the study period. Neither of these parameters are recorded in the medical record and it is not possible to obtain these data retrospectively. Knowing this information would allow determination if the neonates were having brief respiratory pauses (frequent switches to backup but minimal time in backup) or apnea (few switches to backup but longer periods in backup). Another limitation is the lack of randomization of treatment epochs between CPAP and NN0. This would address the possibility that the decrease in CSE is due to 24 h of maturation in these neonates and a similar result could have been noted if the neonates had remained on CPAP. It is also possible that it was not NN0 itself but a change to another mode of ventilatory support that resulted in improvement in number of CSEs. Larger prospective studies are needed to address the limitations of this small, retrospective study and to evaluate if the use of NN0 in these neonates failing CPAP due to CSE may prevent escalation to noninvasive or invasive ventilation thereby decreasing long term morbidity and length of stay.",
