            "text": "Interactions between viral proteins would then recruit the full complement of the genome-23 replication machinery. In 2010, Altan-Bonnet and colleagues discovered that a picornavirus 24 induced the synthesis of the phosphoinositide, phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI4P), and 25 showed that PI4P tracked with sites of genome replication (Hsu et al., 2010) . This observation 26 inspired the hypothesis that a cellular lipid rather than a cellular protein might be the lure used 27 to recruit viral proteins (Hsu et al., 2010) . 28 Ninety-four percent of the docking solutions in the major cluster exhibited a similar head 85 group orientation. Red spheres indicate the position of the phosphate at position four of the 86 inositol ring ( Figure 1A ). In contrast, the orientation of the fatty acyl chains varied for each 87 docking solution. Docking results indicated that K12, R13, and R84 of the major cluster interact 88 PI4P ( Figure 1A) . Similarly, K108 and R143 of the minor cluster are positioned to interact with 89 PI4P ( Figure 1A) . These residues are highly conserved in the 3C proteins of all prototype viruses 90 in the Enterovirus genus of the Picornaviridae family ( Figure 1B) . Even though the sequence 91 similarity between members of the genus ranges from 40-60%, the basic nature of K12, R13, R84, 92 and R143 were conserved, whereas that of K108 was not ( Figures 1B) . 93 Validation of PIP-binding sites by NMR 94 In order to test the validity of our docking observations, we titrated 15 N-labeled 3C protein 95 with soluble dibutyl-PI4P to observe potential NMR chemical shift perturbations (CSPs), which 96 would indicate chemical environment changes in the presence of PI4P (Figure 2) . Out of the three 97 basic residues of the major cluster that were predicted to interact with the PI4P, R13 showed the 98 largest CSP (Figure 2A ). There were also smaller CSPs associated with K12 and R84 (Figure 2A) . 99 However, we did not observe any CSPs for the minor cluster residues K108 and R143. 100 As seen in Figure 2B , the addition of PI4P resulted in a number of CSPs beyond that of 101 K12, R13, and R84. CSPs at least one standard deviation above the mean were considered to be 102 significantly different (CSP >0.019 ppm). Many of these residues were not in the immediate 103 vicinity of a docked PI4P molecule. For example, A9, M10, and N14 are located at the N-terminus 104 of 3C at a distance from PI4P but all showed significant CSPs ( Figure 2B ). These and other 105 perturbations could be caused by other structural changes conferred by PI4P binding. 106 Broad PIP-binding activity of 3C observed in solution 107 In order to assess PIP binding to 3C empirically and evaluate specificity of any observed 108 binding, we used a fluorescence polarization (FP)-based PIP-binding assay (Ceccarelli et al., 2007;  contrast, the bound form of the fluorescent ligand has a larger molecular volume, which reduces 113 the rotation such that the emitted light remains in the same plane as that used for excitation for 114 a longer period of time ( Figure 3A ). This approach was validated by using the PLC-\u03b41 PH domain 115 as a positive control, which showed PI(4,5)P2 binding specificity, as expected ( Figure S1 ) (Harlan 116 et al., 1994) . 117 We measured binding of phosphatidylinositol (PI) and mono-, bis-, or tris-phosphorylated 118 PIPs to 3C ( Figure 3B ). Binding of PI and all mono-phosphorylated PIPs was very weak. However, 119 binding of bis-and tris-phosphorylated PIPs was substantially stronger and without any apparent 120 order or preference ( Figure 3B ). Given the absence of an observed binding preference of 3C, we 121 determined the apparent dissociation constant (Kd,app) for PI(4,5)P2 binding to 3C. The value was 122 5 \u00b1 1 \u00b5M ( Figure 3C ). 123 To assess the contribution of 3C residues implicated in PIP-binding to the actual binding 124 event monitored computationally (Figure 1A) , we changed K12, R13, or R84 to Leu. We used Leu 125 instead of Ala to limit any collateral damage that might be caused by creating a void in the protein 126 that could be filled by water. One expectation was that loss of any of these residues would 127 diminish PIP binding. However, we observed that the K12L derivative behaved as WT (Kd,app = 5 \u00b1 128 1 \u00b5M) ( Figure 3D ). The R13L derivative reduced binding by ~4-fold relative to WT (Kd,app = 23 \u00b1 14 129 \u00b5M) ( Figure 3E ). The R84L derivative actually increased PIP-binding affinity by ~10-fold (Kd,app = NMR experiment, dibutyl-PI4P was used instead. We monitored residues that were implicated in 142 PIP binding: K12, R13, and R84. It should be noted that the CSPs induced by addition of PI4P 143 (Figure 2A ) or RNA ( Figure 3I ) exhibited different trajectories. The addition of PI4P to the 3C-RNA 144 complex ( Figure 3I ) led to resonance positions similar to that of the 3C-PI4P complex (Figure 2A) , 145 suggesting that PI4P competed out RNA and that PI4P and RNA binding were mutually exclusive. 146 Broad PIP-binding activity of 3C observed on membranes 147 It is possible that the context in which a PIP is presented contributes to binding affinity 148 and/or specificity. To address this question, we employed a pH-modulation assay to monitor 149 protein binding to a planar supported lipid bilayer (SLB) in a microfluidic device (Jung et al., 2009; 150 Shengjuler et al., 2017) . The SLB is a stable model membrane system, and the composition of the 151 membrane can be easily tailored to probe interactions of specific lipids with proteins. The SLB 152 used here employed three lipids, the structures of which are illustrated in Figure 4A . A pH-153 sensitive dye, ortho-Sulforhodamine B-POPE (oSRB-POPE), is embedded into the SLB and used to 154 probe protein binding by detecting changes in the local electric field (Figures 4B). Upon binding 155 of 3C, which is positively charged at the experimental pH, the interfacial potential increases and 156 more hydroxide ions are recruited locally. As a result, the fluorescence signal decreases ( Figures  4B and S2) . 158 In these studies, we used 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine (POPC) 159 as the primary component of the SLB. We performed experiments in the presence of Mg 2+ 160 divalent cations to better mimic the cellular environment. 3C did not bind to pure POPC 161 membranes ( Figure 4C ). The addition of PI4P to the POPC membrane revealed the capacity of 3C 162 to bind to this mono-phosphorylated PIP ( Figure 4C ). The value for the Kd,app was 2.4 \u00b1 0.4 \u00b5M 163 (Table 1 ). In addition to PI4P, 3C bound to POPC membranes containing PI3P and PI(4,5)P2, all 164 with essentially the same affinity (Table 1) . PIP binding to 3C in the context of a membrane also 165 required the phosphates because phosphatidylinositol (PI) binding was weak ( Table 1) . Worth 166 noting, PI binding did occur when compared to POPC alone; however, we were unable to produce 167 a complete binding isotherm because of the extremely high concentration of protein required. 168 The presence of PI will produce a net negative charge on the membrane, so the interaction with 169 the basic surface of 3C makes sense. To test the possibility that negative charge alone can 170 promote binding of 3C to the membrane, we performed an experiment in a membrane 171 containing 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-L-serine (POPS). The presence of POPS 172 will also produce a net negative charge on the membrane. The affinity of 3C for the POPS-173 containing membrane was on par with that observed for the PI-containing membrane ( Table 1) . (Figures 5A and 5B) . Although the same residues of 3C were used to interact with 183 both PIPs, the orientation of 3C differed slightly when bound to PI4P compared to that bound to 184 PI(4,5)P2 (Figures 5A and 5B) . For reference, residues of the protease active site have been 185 indicated by black spheres. The orientation of the active site in Figure 5A is clearly different than 186 observed in Figure 5B . This analysis expanded the number of residues interacting with PIP 187 headgroups to include residues in regions observed by NMR, for example D32, K156, and R176 188 ( Figures 5A and 5B) . Interestingly, the contribution of D32 to 3C-PIP interface was mediated by 189 two Na 1+ ions in the case of PI4P ( Figure 5A ) and one Na 1+ ion in the case of PI(4,5)P2 ( Figure 5B ). 190 A surface representation of 3C interacting with PIPs in the context of the membrane showed that 191 3C is propelled above the membrane by the headgroups (Figures 5C and 5D) . The N-terminus of 192 3C was an exception. Rotation of 3C to bring the N-terminus into view showed that the N-193 terminus has a more substantive interaction with the outer leaflet of the bilayer, albeit of a non-194 specific nature (Figures 5E and 5F ). The conformation and interaction of the N-terminus with 195 membrane was also influenced by the PIP present (Figures 5E and 5F ). 197 For the N-terminal residues of 3C to exhibit such conformational flexibility and diverse 198 interactions with membranes, the solution behavior would have to be more dynamic than 199 predicted by the crystal structure (Mosimann et al., 1997) . In order to evaluate the solution 200 beavior of 3C, we performed small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) experiments. Figure 6A shows 201 the scaled scattering profiles of 3C at concentrations ranging from 3.2 mg/mL to 13.0 mg/mL. The 202 overlap of the scaled curves at the low ends of scattering angles was consistent with the protein 203 remaining monomeric over this concentration range in agreement with the NMR and DLS studies 204 (Chan et al., 2016) . The scattering data at the low-angle end showed a linear correlation, 205 satisfying the Guinier approximation (qRg < 1.3), from which we determined a radius of gyration 206 (Rg) of 17.26 \u00c5 ( Figure 6A ). The Rg derived from the Guinier approximation was in good 207 agreement with that estimated from the pair-distance distribution function P(r) calculated by 208 GNOM (real-space Rg = 17.72 \u00c5, reciprocal-space Rg = 17.76 \u00b1 0.13 \u00c5) ( Figure 6B ). From the 209 calculated P(r), the maximum particle dimension of the protein was estimated to be 65 \u00c5 ( Figure   210 6B). The asymmetric shape of the distribution function suggested the presence of a tail in the 211 solution structure of 3C. The values of Rg and Dmax from SAXS data also suggested that the 212 protein exists as a monomer in solution. Furthermore, the estimated molecular mass of 22.2 \u00b1 213 0.9 kDa (derived from Porod volume) or 20.5 \u00b1 1.1 kDa (derived from SAXS MoW calculation) was 214 in very good agreement with the calculated molecular mass of a monomer (19.6 kDa). 215 We compared the calculated scattering profiles of the crystal structure and the average 216 MD structure to the experimental data. As shown in Figure 6C , both structures agreed well with 217 the experimental data. However, the calculated curve from the average MD structure showed a 218 slightly better fitting to the SAXS data relative to the crystal structure (\u03c7 = 1.57 for crystal 219 structure vs. \u03c7 = 1.47 for MD structure). Next, we built the ab initio low-resolution SAXS model 220 using DAMMIN and DAMMIF programs; 10 independent models from each program were 221 generated and averaged. The models were highly similar; the average values of the normalized 222 spatial discrepancy (NSD), which represents the similarity among the models, were 0.563 \u00b1 0.01 223 and 0.698 \u00b1 0.064 for DAMMIN and DAMMIF models, respectively. Superimposing the average 224 MD structure onto the SAXS model showed a very good agreement between these two models 225 with an NSD of 0.66. The crystal structure showed less agreement with the SAXS model with an 226 NSD of 0.92. The reconstructed low-resolution SAXS model clearly revealed the presence of an 227 extended and highly dynamic N-terminal helix of 3C, the volume of which exceeded the volume 228 of a helix that is 14 residues in length ( Figure 6D ). Worth noting, the amphipathic nature of this 229 helix ( Figure S3 ) may also contribute to the alternative conformations observed on membranes 230 (Figures 5E and 5F ).",

            "text": "The membranes forming the genome-replication organelle of enteroviruses are enriched 233 in PI4P. It is known that the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase domain, 3D, of enteroviruses binds 234 to PI4P, although it is not clear where on the protein this binding occurs (Hsu et al., 2010) . 235 Because the 3CD protein accumulates to a much higher level in PV-infected cells than 3D and 3CD 236 has been implicated in formation and/or function of the genome-replication organelle (Oh et al., 237 2009), we used the available structural information for these proteins (Marcotte et al., 2007; 238 Mosimann et al., 1997; Thompson and Peersen, 2004) to screen for PI4P-binding sites by using a 239 molecular-docking algorithm (Goodsell et al., 1996; Morris et al., 1998) . The observation of a 240 putative PI4P-binding site on 3C was unexpected but exciting as it was now very possible that 241 trafficking of PV proteins to the site of genome replication might be facilitated by use of new 242 structural classes of PI4P-binding domains (Figure 1 ). Our focus on 3C was motivated by the 243 arsenal of structural and computational resources available to study PV 3C that would facilitate 244 identification and characterization of the PI4P-binding site (Amero et al., 2008; Marcotte et al., 245 2007; Mosimann et al., 1997; Moustafa et al., 2015) , including a near-complete backbone NMR 246 resonance assignment of the 2D (Amero et al., 2008) . 247 Using a solution-and bilayer-based assay for PIP binding, we observed PIP binding by 3C 248 (Figures 3 and 4) . Titration of PI4P into a solution containing 3C caused CSPs that were consistent 249 with the major PI4P-binding site observed computationally (Figure 2A) . However, the CSPs also 250 included other residues (Figure 2B) , in particular residues known to contribute to the RNA-251 binding activity of 3C (Amero et al., 2008) . PIP-binding was indeed competitive with RNA binding 252 (Figures 3H and 3I) . For a small molecule like PI4P to cause so many CSPs or to compete with a 253 substantially larger RNA, either multiple molecules of PI4P bind to the protein or a single 254 molecule of PI4P induces a large change in the conformation and/or dynamics of the protein. 255 Analysis of NMR spectra were inconsistent with large-scale changes in conformation or dynamics 256 as most of the resonance positions and intensities were not affected by PI4P binding (Figure 2) . 257 MD simulations were consistent with multiple PIPs binding to PV 3C along the shallow cleft used 258 for RNA binding (Figure 5) . While the negative charge of the phospholipid headgroup contributed 259 to PIP binding, the display of the charge on the inositol ring contributed to high-affinity binding 260 ( Table 1) . In this regard, neither the location of the phosphate on the inositol ring nor the number 261 of phosphates on the inositol ring mattered for 3C binding ( Table 1) , although the nature of the 262 PIP influenced the conformation of 3C bound to membrane observed computationally ( Figure 5) . 263 MD simulations indicated that one contributor to the PIP-dependent conformation is the 264 flexibility of the N-terminus (compare Figures 5E and 5F ). Such conformational flexibility of the 265 3C N-terminus was also observed in solution using SAXS (Figure 6 ).",

            "text": "The PIP-binding site structure, corresponding specificity and extreme capacity to cluster 267 PIPs differs substantially from known cellular PIP-binding domains. Most cellular PIP-binding 268 domains contain a solvent-accessible, basic cavity to which a PIP binds (Lemmon, 2008) . In certain 269 cases, spatial restriction within the cavity enables stereospecificity to the interaction with a PIP (Chukkapalli et al., 2010; Johnson et al., 2016; Saad et al., 2006) . The role of viral matrix 301 proteins is to bridge the genome or some genome-containing ribonucleoprotein complex to the 302 membrane used to envelope the virus as it buds from the cell. Both of these viral proteins appear 303 to bind specifically to PI(4,5)P2. PIP-binding signals to the protein that it has reached the 304 destination for assembly. In the case of MA, PIP binding triggers the exposure and insertion of 305 its myristoylated N-terminus into the plasma membrane (Saad et al., 2006) . In the case of VP40, 306 PIP binding promotes oligomerization (Johnson et al., 2016) . Both HIV MA and Ebola VP40 307 assemble into oligomers, which cluster PIPs, but not to the same extreme as predicted for 3C 308 (Johnson et al., 2016; Saad et al., 2006) . Both of these matrix proteins bind RNA. In the case of Non-structural protein 5A (NS5A) from hepatitis C virus binds PI(4,5)P2 and to lesser 312 extent PI(3,4)P2 through its N-terminal amphipathic \u03b1-helix (Cho et al., 2015) . The motif used has 313 been referred to as the basic amino acid PIP2 pincer (BAAPP) domain (Cho et al., 2015) . This motif 314 is nothing more than two basic amino acids flanking a series of hydrophobic residues displayed 315 on a helix, presumably that penetrates into the bilayer (Cho et al., 2015) . The BAAPP motif can 316 be found in amphipathic \u03b1-helices of cellular and viral proteins; however, the function is not 317 known. Indeed, such a motif might exist in the N-terminus of 3C ( Figure S3 ). In the case of 3C, 318 we propose that this helix just augments membrane binding without any specificity (Figures 5E 319 and 5F). How the BAAPP domain confers specificity is not known. It is worth noting that NS5A is 320 an RNA-binding protein. The organization described for 3C, amphipathic \u03b1-helix followed by an 321 RNA-binding domain, therefore applies to NS5A. It is compelling to speculate that this RNA-322 binding domain might also interact with PIPs. Our computational studies suggested that 3C interacted with a single PIP mediated by 340 K12 and R84. (Figure 1A) . Although R13 was nearby, a role for this residue in PIP binding was not 341 suggested ( Figure 1A) . Removal of the positive charge from K12 had no impact on PIP binding, 342 removal from R84 increased PIP-binding affinity, but removal from R13 weakened PIP-binding 343 affinity ( Figures 3C-3F) . A role for R13 and R84 in PIP binding was supported by NMR experiments, 344 but the evidence for K12 was weak ( Figure 2B) . So, while the molecular-docking simulation 345 pointed us in the right direction, the molecular details of the putative interaction were not Deliberate interrogation of this hypothesis is warranted. 364 In conclusion, in an effort to begin to identify proteins and mechanisms that PV uses to 365 recognize PIPs, we have discovered that nature has been creative and adapted a viral RNA-366 binding surface to perform this additional task. The outcome is a new structural class of PIP-367 binding proteins with the capacity for multivalent binding to any mono-, bis-or tris-phosphorylated PIP, but with a unique conformational state determined by the nature of the 369 bound PIP. It is likely that a similar mechanism exists in noroviruses and coronaviruses, suggesting 370 a role for PIPs in the biology of these viruses even though empirical support of this possibility is 371 needed. CSPs at least one standard deviation above the average were considered to be substantial (\u0394\uf064total = 0.019 ppm). These results are in agreement with the docking analyses, which show PI4P-binding towards the N-terminus of 3C. ",

The production simulations of 400 ns in length were then performed.",

The major cluster (94% of the trials) encompasses residues K12, R13, and R84; the minor cluster (6% of the trials) encompasses residues K108 and R143. Total of 100 docking runs were performed. The crystal structure of 3C (PDB 1L1N) was obtained from the Protein Data Bank (Mosimann et al., 1997) . The structure of the PI4P ligand was prepared by modifying the structure of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2), extracted from the NMR complex structure of HIV-1 matrix protein bound to PI(4,5)P2 (Saad et al., 2006) . Phosphates on the inositol head group are depicted as red spheres; basic residues in the major and minor clusters are depicted as sticks. (B) Multiple-sequence alignment of enteroviral 3C proteins shows that the majority of the residues predicted by docking (K12, R13, R84, and R143) and/or the basic charge are conserved; K108 is not conserved (colored in blue).

While 272 cellular PIP-binding proteins are known to bind more than one PIP or a single PIP in combination 273 with another anionic phospholipid, the maximum number is usually two PIPs (Moravcevic et al., 274 2012; Yamamoto et al., 2016). The expanded specificity does not represent mere sloppiness but 275 permits regulation by the simultaneous presence of multiple PIPs, which has been referred to as 276 coincidence detection (Moravcevic et al., 2012). The broad specificity of the 3C PIP-binding site 277 is unprecedented in mammalian systems but broad specificity may be more common in the yeast, 278 Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Yu et al., 2004). This circumstance may not cause a problem for the 279 virus because PI4P synthesis is induced immediately upon infection, and the levels of other PIPs 280 in the cell exist at a much lower level (van Meer et al., 2008). Much of the apparent affinity of 3C 281 for the PIP-containing membrane derives from the multivalent nature of the interaction (Figure 5). Clustering of PIPs has been suggested by MD of cellular PIP-binding proteins bound to 283 membranes; however, binding of two PIPs is most common (Yamamoto et al., 2016). 284 Binding of five PIPs to the same protein seems extraordinary (Figure 5). Whether or not 285 the virus requires substantial PIP clustering and whether or not such substantial PIP clustering 286 causes a biological response are questions that need to be addressed in the future. One class of 287 PIP-binding proteins uses an unstructured basic domain to bind to a leaflet of the bilayer and 288 sequester PIPs (McLaughlin et al., 2002). Amongst the best-characterized member of this class of 289 proteins is MARCKS, myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate (McLaughlin et al., 2002). PIP 290 sequestration causes an increase in PIP concentration, which may serve to increase signaling 291 intensity when acted upon by effectors such as phospholipases (McLaughlin et al., 2002). The 292 process of sequestration can be tuned down or turned off by the presence of Ca 2+ (McLaughlin 293 et al., 2002). Similarly, 3C bound to a membrane should sequester PIPs. Indeed, 3C binding to 294 membranes at any significant level could act as a phosphoinositide sink, given the presence of 295 contact sites to connect all of the intracellular membranes (Helle et al., 2013; Raiborg et al., 296 2016). The ability of a virus to sequester phosphoinositides could have a profound, debilitating 297 effect on the cell.",

One of the most prominent members of the Calicivirus family is Norwalk Virus and 325 other human noroviruses (NoV), the so-called cruise-ship diarrhea viruses. Prominent members 326 of the Coronavirus family include Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Virus (SARS CoV) and 327 Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome Virus (MERS CoV). PV 3C, NoV 3CL (also known as NS6) and 328 SARS/MERS CoV 3CL (also known as nsp5) share a chymotrypsin-like fold (Anand et al., 2002; 329 Hilgenfeld, 2014; Mosimann et al., 1997; Zeitler et al., 2006). The protease active sites are quite 330 similar. Structurally, NoV 3CL is extremely close to PV 3C, with clear conservation of residues 331 corresponding to: K12, R13, D32, K156 and R176 (Zeitler et al., 2006). Residues of SARS/MERS 332 CoV 3CL are not so highly conserved, but the surface of this protein corresponding to the PIP-333 binding surface of PV 3C is clearly basic (Anand et al., 2002). There is one report of RNA binding 334 by NoV 3CL (Viswanathan et al., 2013) but none for the CoV proteins. The possibility that 335 members of other virus families of medical importance encode a PIP-binding protein like that of 336 PV 3C suggests that this activity may represent a target with broad-spectrum therapeutic 337potential. Empirical studies of the NoV and CoV 3CL proteins will be required to assess this 338 possibility.",

            "text": "346 correct. The inaccuracy may have been caused by our attempt to dock a single PI4P instead of 347 multiple PIPs. The 3C-membrane-binding simulation (Figures 5A and 5B) produced results that 348 were consistent with both the NMR and mutagenesis experiments. K12 has either no or a minor 349 role in binding PI4P (Figure 5A) or PI(4,5)P2 (Figure 5B). R13 interacts directly with one (Figure 350 5A) or two (Figure 5B) PIP phosphates. R84 is near the Na 1+ ions at the interface; removal of the 351 charge in this instance could be stabilizing. 352 The broad repertoire of PIPs bound by 3C may occur specifically and regulate the 353 conformation of 3C. Although the same collection of 3C residues appear to be involved in 354 interactions with both PI4P and PI(4,5)P2, the architecture of the interface is different (Figure 5). 355 It is possible that these apparent states are interconvertible and just reflect the short duration of 356 the simulated trajectory. However, it is possible that different PIPs stabilize different states. For 357 the K-Ras4A protein, it is known that POPS stabilizes a different conformation of this protein than 358 PI(4,5)P2 (Li and Buck, 2017a). During infection, 3C functions primarily in the context of a larger 359 precursor, 3CD. 3CD is known to have many functions before, during and after genome 360 replication (Cameron et al., 2010; Oh et al., 2017). Having functions dictated by conformational 361 states of the protein stabilized by phospholipid composition of the membrane to which 3CD is 362 bound would be an elegant explanation of the regulation of the many activities of this protein.363",

FIGURE LEGENDS Docking analysis reveals a putative phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI4P)-binding site near the N-terminus of poliovirus 3C. (A) Two clusters were identified by docking dibutyl-PI4P (red spheres) on 3C surface (grey ribbon). The major cluster (94% of the trials) encompasses residues K12, R13, and R84; the minor cluster (6% of the trials) encompasses residues K108 and R143. Total of 100 docking runs were performed. The crystal structure of 3C (PDB 1L1N) was obtained from the Protein Data Bank(Mosimann et al., 1997). The structure of the PI4P ligand was prepared by modifying the structure of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2), extracted from the NMR complex structure of HIV-1 matrix protein bound to PI(4,5)P2(Saad et   al., 2006). Phosphates on the inositol head group are depicted as red spheres; basic residues in the major and minor clusters are depicted as sticks. (B) Multiple-sequence alignment of enteroviral 3C proteins shows that the majority of the residues predicted by docking (K12, R13, R84, and R143) and/or the basic charge are conserved; K108 is not conserved (colored in blue).Residues implicated in phosphoinositide-binding ( ); conserved residues (*); PV, poliovirus; CV, coxsackievirus; EV, enterovirus; BEV, bovine enterovirus; PEV, porcine enterovirus; SEV, simian enterovirus; SV, simian virus.",

(A) The principles of the fluorescence polarization (FP)-based PIP-binding assay. Unbound form of the fluorescent ligand (PIP-BODIPY-FL) yields low polarization value dueto its small size and rapid rotation. In contrast, the bound form yields a higher polarization value due to the overall size of the complex and its slow rotation. All FP-based PIP-binding experiments were conducted in a buffer containing 20 mM HEPES at pH 7.5 and 10 mM NaCl. 3C-PI(4,5)P2 samples were incubated for 30 s inside a chamber at 25 \u00b0C prior to measuring the millipolarization (mP).

Error bars represent the SEM (n = 3). (C) WT 3C and 3C variants: (D) K12L, (E) R13L, and (F) R84L bind to phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2) with varying affinities.

(G) The principles of the fluorescence polarization (FP)-based competition assay. 3C-RNA (fluorescently-labeled 11-mer) complex is pre-formed, which yields a high polarization value. As the unlabeled dibutyl-phosphatidylinositol 4,5bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2) competes out the bound RNA, the millipolarization (mP) value decreases. (H) FP-based competition experiments. The unlabeled PI(4,5)P2 efficiently competes out the bound RNA, suggesting that these interactions are mutually exclusive. The competition experiment with phosphatidylinositol (PI) competitor is used to show that binding to 3C is required for RNA displacement.

Snapshots of selected simulations show that 3C interacts with five, clustered PI4P or PI(4,5)P2 molecules. PI4P and PI(4,5)P2 are shown as dark grey sticks with phosphates colored orange (phosphorus) and red (oxygen). 3C is shown as a light grey ribbon; residue side chains are colored as follows: light blue (positive side chains) and red (negative side chains) sticks. Also shown are: sodium ions as magenta spheres; the amino-and carboxy-termini as blue and red spheres, respectively; 3C protease active-site residues as black spheres. Specific interactions are as follows, with number in parentheses referring to headgroup in panel: (1) R13 and R84; (2) D32,mediated by sodium ions; (3) D32 for PI4P in panel A mediated by sodium, or R176 for PI(4,5)P2 in panel B; (4) K156 and R176; (5) \u03b1-amino group of G1 for PI4P in panel A, or K12 and R13 for PI(4,5)P2 in panel B.

SLBs were formed on the glass floor of each microchannel by spontaneous fusion of the SUVs. Running Buffer [20 mM HEPES, 100 mM NaCl, at pH 7.0] was flowed through each channel for 30 min to get rid of excess vesicles.
