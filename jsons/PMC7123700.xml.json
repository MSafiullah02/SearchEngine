Nanoparticles can be classified as particles of a size no greater than 100 nm, and their unique attributes to combat infection have received considerable attention. Nanomaterials are increasingly finding uses in products such as antimicrobial surface coatings and semiconductors. Such nanoparticulate materials include spherical, cubic and needle-like nanoscaled particles (approximately 5\u2013100 nm) and near-nanoscaled devices (up to micrometers) (Cushing et al. 2004). The properties of nanoparticles, for example hardness, active surface area, chemical reactivity and biological activity, can be dramatically different from those of micrometer-sized particles (Allaker and Ren 2008), and indeed the biocidal effectiveness of metallic nanoparticles has been suggested to be due to both their size and their high surface-to-volume ratio. Such characteristics should allow them to closely interact with microbial membranes, the effect not being solely due to the release of metal ions (Morones et al. 2005). Metallic and other nanoparticles are now being combined with polymers or coated onto surfaces which may have a variety of potential antimicrobial applications within the oral cavity (Monteiro et al. 2009; Hannig et al. 2007).",

Bacteria are the predominant components of this resident microflora, and the high species diversity found reflects the wide range of endogenously derived nutrients, the varied types of habitat for colonisation, and the opportunity to survive on surfaces provided by a biofilm. Within this context, a biofilm can be classed as an aggregate of microorganisms in which cells adhere to each other and to a surface (Marsh and Martin 2009). However, perhaps more commonly than elsewhere in the body, the relationship between this flora and the host in the oral cavity can be disrupted in a number of ways, resulting in the development of disease of the oral structures.",

As a result, the composition of the microbial flora of the mouth varies considerably from site to site and at different times. The composition of the oral microflora, in addition to being variable, is highly complex. Up to 1,000 different species of bacteria at 108\u2013109 bacteria per mL saliva or mg dental plaque are known to be associated with the oral cavity, and it has been suggested that only 50% of the bacteria found at this site can be cultured (Marsh and Martin 2009).",

Most bacterial infections within the oral cavity are polymicrobial in nature, and it is quite unusual to find any that are clearly due to a single species. The relative contribution of different bacterial components in such infections is thus difficult to determine. Oral infections may arise either from an endogenous source, i.e. one yielding microorganisms normally found in the mouth, such as plaque-related dental caries (\u2018tooth decay\u2019) and periodontal disease (\u2018gum disease\u2019), or an exogenous source yielding micro-organisms not normally found as part of the oral microflora. Dental caries and periodontal disease involve the adherence of bacteria and development of biofilms on both the natural and restored tooth surface. The use of nano-sized antimicrobials offers the possibility to control the formation of these and other oral biofilms through the use of nanoparticles with biocidal, anti-adhesive and delivery capabilities.",

On the tooth surface, the initial colonisers adhere to the acquired pellicle, a salivary-/dietary-derived proteinaceous layer, which can then influence the subsequent sequence of colonisation by microorganisms (Marsh and Bradshaw 1995). The acquired pellicle also contains several antibacterial components such as secretory immunoglobulin A (IgA) and lysozyme, and provides both barrier and buffering functions (Hannig and Joiner 2006). Both de- and remineralisation processes of the teeth are also mediated by the pellicle. In terms of bacterial colonisation, many of the proteins that make up the pellicle act as receptors for the specific interaction with adhesins on the surface of pioneer bacterial species (Hannig and Joiner 2006). This layer is therefore of particular relevance as regards the interactions of both bacteria and nanoparticles with the tooth surface.",

The major growth of dental plaque mass then occurs by bacterial cell division within the biofilm rather than by co-aggregation at the surface of the developing biofilm (Kolenbrander et al. 2006). The initial communities of bacteria found within the supragingival plaque (above the gum margin) biofilm are of a relatively low diversity in comparison to those present in the mature communities of both supragingival and subgingival (below the gum margin) plaque. Initial colonisers include Streptococcus oralis, S. sanguinis and S. mitis. The coaggregating partners with these bacteria would then include predominantly Gram-negative species, for example Eikenella corrodens, Veillonella atypica and Prevotella loescheii. Coaggregation bridges between these early colonisers and Fusobacterium nucleatum, are common and the latter then co-aggregates with numerous late colonisers. Late colonisers include Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Prevotella intermedia, Treponema denticola and Porphyromonas gingivalis (Kolenbrander et al. 2006). The interactions between oral bacteria are integral to the development and maturation of the biofilm. Such interactions occur at a number of levels and include physical contact, metabolic exchange, molecular communication and genetic material exchange.",

Extracellular polymeric substances, produced by bacteria in a mature biofilm, contain large amounts of polysaccharides, proteins, nucleic acids and lipids. These maintain the structural integrity of the biofilm and provide an ideal matrix for bacterial cell growth and survival (Sutherland 2001). The biofilm mode of growth is thus clearly distinguished from planktonic growth by a number of features, which includes the resistance to antimicrobial agents at concentrations that approach 1,000 times greater than that required to kill planktonic microorganisms (Jenkinson and Lamont 2005; Lewis 2001). This is of major significance in the development of nano-antimicrobials and the extrapolation of in vitro findings.",

The disease process involves acidogenic plaque bacteria, including Streptococcus mutans, S. sobrinus and Lactobacillus spp. (Hardie 1992), whereas periodontal diseases can involve both the soft and hard tissues and are initiated by components of the plaque biofilm that develop on the hard root surface adjacent to the soft tissues of the supporting periodontium. Periodontal disease may be confined to the gingiva (gingivitis) or extend to the deeper supporting structures with destruction of the periodontal ligament and the alveolar bone that supports the teeth (periodontitis). This loss of attachment, with associated periodontal pocket formation, may ultimately lead to loosening and loss of the affected teeth. Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia and Treponema denticola are now regarded as the major pathogens in advancing periodontitis (Ximenez-Fyvie et al. 2000).",

Current forms of treatment are often inadequate and may result in chronic infection requiring implant removal and costly resective and regenerative procedures in an attempt to restore and reshape the implant support (Zitzmann and Berglundh 2008).

            "text": "Issues surrounding the uptake and penetration of antimicrobial agents into biofilms are key considerations in the administration of therapeutics (Stewart 2003). This is of particular importance within the oral cavity when these agents have to reach fewer accessible stagnation sites or through plaque to the enamel. Thus, there remains an interest in the development of plaque control measures that require a minimum of public compliance and professional health care intervention (Wilson 1996). Within this context, antimicrobial nanoparticles may be of particular value if retained at approximal teeth surfaces and below the gum margin. The anti-caries potential of fluoride and other more conventional antimicrobial/antiplaque agents, which are mostly deployed in mouthwashes and toothpastes, have been well characterised (Baehni and Takeuchi 2003). However, the potential of nanoparticles as constituents of topical agents to control oral biofilms through either their biocidal or anti-adhesive capabilities is now emerging as an area worthy of serious consideration. The studies by Robinson and co-workers using the \u2018Leeds in situ model\u2019, a device that allows dental plaque to develop in situ on a removable human enamel surface, have helped in the assessment of novel antimicrobial agents and take into account the very complex microbial composition and architecture of plaque biofilms (Watson et al. 2005). The use of such intact biofilms on natural tooth surfaces would be of particular value to a study of the penetration of nanoparticles and released ions in situ. This model has indicated that plaque contains voids and channels, sometimes extending completely through the biomass to the underlying enamel (Wood et al. 2000). The presence of channels may have considerable influence on the transfer of nanoparticles through biofilms. The main considerations are the physico-chemical characteristics of the particular nanoparticles used, including the surface charge and degree of hydrophobicity, the surface area-to-mass ratio of the plaque biofilm and the ability of the particles to adsorb to/be taken up at the biofilm surface. Within this context, nanoparticles are potentially useful because it is possible to alter their surface charge, hydrophobicity, and other physical and chemical characteristics (Nel et al. 2009).",

            "text": "The antibacterial and antiviral actions of elemental silver, Ag+ ions, and silver compounds have been extensively investigated (Monteiro et al. 2009). In comparison to other metals, silver is relatively less toxic to human cells, albeit at very low concentrations. Ag+ ions have been considered for a range of biomedical applications, including their use within the dental field as an antibacterial component in dental resin composites (Herrera et al. 2001). Silver also exhibits a strong affinity for zeolite, a porous crystalline material of hydrated aluminosilicate which can bind up to 40% Ag+ ions within its structure. Silver zeolite has been incorporated into tissue conditioners, acrylic resins, and mouth rinses within the dental field (Casemiro et al. 2008; Kawahara et al. 2000; Matsuura et al. 1997; Morishita et al. 1998). Silver nanoparticles (Fig. 14.1a), either alone or together with other antimicrobial agents, have shown particularly encouraging results (Sondi and Salopek-Sondi 2004; Li et al. 2005; Rai et al. 2009). The use of silver salt nanoparticles instead of elemental silver or complex silver compounds to prevent biofilm formation on surfaces for both biomedical and more general use has been investigated. Using silver bromide precipitation to synthesise polymer\u2013nanocomposites, surfaces were shown to resist biofilm formation. It was also shown to be possible, through controlling the size of the embedded AgBr, to modify the release of biocidal Ag+ ions (Sambhy et al. 2006).",

            "text": "In comparison to conventional antimicrobials, surprisingly little is known about how nanoparticles behave in relation to microorganisms, particularly at the cellular level. The mechanism of the antimicrobial activity of silver is not completely understood, but is likely to involve multiple targets in comparison to the more defined targets of antibiotics. Studies have shown that the positive charge on the Ag+ ion is critical for antimicrobial activity, allowing the electrostatic attraction between the negative charge of the bacterial cell membrane and positively charged nanoparticles (Kim et al. 2007). In terms of the molecular mechanisms of inhibitory action of Ag+ ions on microorganisms, it has been shown that DNA loses its ability to replicate (Feng et al. 2000), and the expression of ribosomal subunit proteins and other cellular proteins and enzymes necessary for ATP production becomes inactivated (Yamanaka et al. 2005). It has also been hypothesised that Ag+ ions affect membrane-bound respiratory enzymes (Bragg and Rainnie 1974). However, the precise mechanism(s) of biocidal activity of silver nanoparticles against bacteria remains to be fully elucidated. The work of Sondi and Salopek-Sondi (2004) demonstrated structural changes and damage to bacterial membranes resulting in cell death. These particular studies suggest that sulphur-containing proteins in the membrane or inside the cells and phosphorus-containing elements, such as DNA, are likely to be the preferential binding sites for silver nanoparticles. The contribution of Ag+ ion release from nanoparticles to the overall antimicrobial activity remains unclear. It is suggested that a bacterial cell in contact with silver nanoparticles will take up Ag+ ions, which possibly in turn will inhibit respiratory enzymes and so help to generate free radicals, and subsequent free radical-induced damage to the cell membrane. In order to determine the relationship between free radical formation and antimicrobial activity, the use of antioxidants does suggest that free radicals may be derived from the surface of silver nanoparticles (Kim et al. 2007).",

The bacteriocidal effect of the nanoparticles was compared using disc diffusion tests, and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bacteriocidal concentration (MBC) determinations in batch cultures. Bacterial sensitivity was found to differ according to the species tested and the test system employed. For all strains of S. aureus and E. coli, the action of silver nanoparticles was found to be superior. Strain-specific variation for S. aureus was negligible, while some strain-specific variation was observed for E. coli. A higher sensitivity, as shown with B. subtilis, may be attributed to more amine and carboxyl groups (in comparison to other species) on the cell surface, these groups having a greater affinity for copper (Beveridge and Murray 1980). Released copper ions within the cell may then disrupt nucleic acid and key enzymes (Stohs and Bagchi 1995). In theory, a combination of silver and copper nanoparticles may give rise to a more complete bacteriocidal effect, especially against a mixed population of bacteria. Indeed, the studies of Ren et al.

            "text": "Titanium dioxide (TiO2) is the commonest titanium compound, and its ability to act as a photocatalytic antimicrobial compound is well established (Blake et al. 1999). TiO2 is widely used in a number of applications, as a powder and increasingly in a nanoparticulate form, and is generally considered to be non-toxic at the concentrations normally employed. However, there are recent concerns that nano-titanium oxide may present a hazard to health through inflammation as generated by release of IL-1\u03b1 (Yazdi et al. 2010). The anatase form of nano TiO2 and UV light excitation are required to ensure maximum antimicrobial activity. Such TiO2 photocatalysis is able to promote the peroxidation of the polyunsaturated phospholipid component of the microbial lipid membrane, induce loss of respiratory activity, and elicit cell death (Maness et al. 1999). In comparison to silver and copper nanoparticles, there have been relatively few studies on nano-titanium/-titanium dioxide. The study of Tsuang et al. (2008) demonstrated TiO2-mediated photocatalytic and bacteriocidal activities against obligate aerobes (Pseudomonas aeruginosa), facultative anaerobes (S. aureus, E. coli and Enterococcus hirae) and obligate anaerobes (Bacteroides fragilis). Concentrations of titanium oxide (predominantly anatase phase; in the absence of UV light; particle size: approx. 18 nm; surface area: 87 m2 g\u22121) required to have a growth inhibitory and killing effect against a range of pathogens including E. coli and MRSA. have been shown to be 1.0\u20132.5 and >2.5 mg mL\u22121 respectively, while with those organisms implicated in oral infections, including A. actinomycetemcomitans, P. gingivalis, Prev. intermedia and F. nucleatum, growth inhibitory and killing concentrations are in the same order at 0.25\u20132.5 and >2.5 mg mL\u22121, respectively (R.P.

Antimicrobial activity was assessed against Enterococcus faecalis as a pathogen often isolated from root canal infections.

Casein phosphopeptide (CPP) \u2013 amorphous calcium phosphate (ACP) nanocomplex (Recaldent\u2122) \u2013 is a particular technology based upon ACP and stabilised by casein phosphopeptide (CPP) (Reynolds 2008). Use of this technology has demonstrated anticariogenic activity under both in vitro and in vivo conditions. The levels of calcium and phosphate ions in supragingival plaque have been shown to increase upon delivery of CPP-ACP in a mouth rinse form and promote remineralisation of enamel subsurface lesions (Reynolds et al. 2003). Analysis of plaque samples demonstrated CPP-ACP nanocomplexes to be localised in plaque on the surface of bacterial cells and essentially confirm the studies by Rose (Rose 2000a; Rose 2000b) who demonstrated tight binding to Streptococcus mutans and the intercellular plaque matrix to provide a calcium ion reservoir. As a result of interaction with calcium binding sites and the masking of bacterial receptors on salivary molecules, CPP-ACP is thought to reduce bacterial colonisation as shown with CPP-ACP germanium-treated surfaces.

An approach involving the impregnation of silicone (as used in a wide variety of devices) with nanoparticulate silver, using supercritical carbon dioxide, has been investigated (Furno et al. 2004). This may be particularly applicable as regards implantable devices, as their use is a major risk factor for hospital-acquired infection. The initiation of infection involving biomaterials requires an initial adhesion event to the device or more often to the patient-derived glycoprotein coating (conditioning film) which is deposited from the time of implantation (Green et al. 1999). Following adhesion, microbial proliferation leads to the development of a biofilm which is more resistant to the effect of antimicrobials. Although approaches to prevent this type of infection, including the use of coatings with nanoparticulate silver, have been proposed, unsatisfactory clinical results and on occasion further complications, have occurred (Riley et al. 2002). Possible reasons for the lack of activity include the inactivation of the antimicrobial coating by plasma components and a lack of inherent durability of the coatings used. Impregnation of polymers may well be more beneficial than the use of coatings or addition into the mix. A significant level of surface- or near-surface-deposited silver nanoparticles should provide an initial \u201cburst\u201d effect. However, Furno et al. (2004) showed that the majority of the antimicrobial activity, against both biofilms and planktonic cells, was simply removed by washing the polymer discs impregnated with silver nanoparticles. Further sustained release with significant antimicrobial activity would need to be carefully evaluated. The protection of both inner and outer surfaces against bacterial colonisation by impregnation of an antimicrobial agent is advantageous (Wilcox et al. 1988) and has been demonstrated in the clinical setting (Darouiche et al. 1999). The continued release of Ag+ ions at antimicrobial concentrations even in the presence of a plasma protein conditioning film, and the ability to offer protection to both the inner and outer surfaces of a catheter, are two distinct potential advantages of polymer impregnation (Furno et al. 2004).",

For copper nanoparticles embedded in an inert, Teflon (polytetrafluoroethylene)-like matrix, Cioffi et al. (2005b) demonstrated significant antimicrobial activity in vitro as a result of ion release. It is suggested that in such an experimental situation a bacterial growth medium facilitates the release of metallic ions, possibly as a consequence of a reaction with the nutrient media constituents. A greater release of copper ions into a liquid medium could well be due to the presence of an oxide layer on the copper nanoparticles and reaction with chloride ions in the medium. The copper\u2013fluoropolymer (Cu-CFx) nano-composite films in this study were deposited by dual ion-beam sputtering, a technique to deposit different polymeric and inorganic materials in a very controlled manner. Analysis of the layers revealed that the inorganic Cu(II) nanoparticles were evenly dispersed in the branched fluoropolymer matrix. Through the use of electrochemical atomic absorption spectroscopy, copper release kinetics in solutions was measured. A correlation was shown between the chemical composition (copper loading) of the material surface, the concentration of copper ions released into the microbial culture broths, and the bioactivity of the Cu-CFx coating. The Cu-CFx layers, used as coatings, were shown to inhibit the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the bacterial species E. coli, S. aureus and Listeria spp. Such use of Cu-CFx coatings, which allow variable metal loading, demonstrate good stability upon storage and microbial inhibitory activity, is being explored in a variety of applied fields, including food chemistry and biomedicine.",

This approach is now being utilised within the clinical setting in some countries. The killing of microorganisms with light depends upon cytotoxic singlet oxygen and free radical generation by the excitation of a photo-activatable agent or sensitiser. The result of excitation is that the sensitiser moves from an electronic ground state to a triplet state that then interacts with microbial components to generate cytotoxic species (MacRobert et al. 1989). One of the advantages of light-activated killing is that resistance to the action of singlet oxygen is unlikely to become widespread in comparison to that experienced with more traditional chemical antimicrobial agents. A sensitiser ideally should absorb light at red to near-infrared wavelengths because these wavelengths are able to penetrate more. The most commonly tested sensitisers on bacteria have been tricyclic dyes (for example methylene blue, erythrosine), tetrapyrroles (for example porphyrins) and furocoumarins (for example psoralen). The use of nanoparticles within this area is now under investigation. For example, a complex of biodegradable and biocompatible poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) and colloidal gold nanoparticles, loaded with methylene blue and exposed to red light at 665 nm, have been tested against planktonic E. faecalis and in experimentally infected root canals (Pagonis et al. 2010). In theory, gold nanoparticle conjugates should have improved binding and cell wall penetration properties, and so should deliver a higher concentration of photoactive molecules. It remains to be fully established whether such conjugates will show an increased antibacterial activity when compared to more conventional treatments.",

The photosensitiser erythrosine has an advantage over some other dyes because it is currently used in dentistry to visualise dental plaque in vivo, and so its lack of toxicity in the host is well established. For use in periodontitis, the dye needs to be applied subgingivally prior to fiber-optic laser light activation. However, when disease is present, the periodontal site has a marked flow of gingival crevicular fluid into the pocket, and most photosensitisers lose some activity in the presence of extraneous protein. Also, some have virtually no effect in the presence of saliva and other body fluids. This is because the agents complex with proteins and host cells in the gingival crevicular fluid and effectively compete for binding to bacteria. The use of nanoparticles as applied to PDT may help to overcome some of the issues associated with serum constituents.",

The contribution of surface charge to both mammalian and microbial interactions has been clearly illustrated using surfactant-coated nanoparticles (McCarron et al. 2007). Both anti-adherent and antifungal effects were shown using buccal epithelial cells treated with non-drug-loaded poly (ethylcyanoacrylate) nanoparticles. Nanoparticles were prepared using emulsion polymerisation and stabilised with cationic, anionic or non-ionic surfactants. Cationic surfactants, for example cetrimide, which are known antimicrobial agents, were the most effective in reducing Candida albicans blastospore adhesion, and showed a growth inhibitory and biocidal effect against the yeast. Production of nanoparticles with an anionic surfactant gave lower yields and wide particle size distributions. No evidence of killing against C. albicans was shown. Non-ionic surfactant-coated nanoparticles produced intermediate kill rates. These studies clearly demonstrate the importance of surface charge on the nanoparticle surface. It is envisaged that the buccal epithelium could possibly be treated using polymeric-type nanoparticles in a mouthwash-type formulation; effectively this would prime the potential target cells against adhesion and infection.",

(2008) have recently shown that metal oxide nanoparticles are more toxic than at first envisaged at concentrations down to 40 \u03bcg mL\u22121 and show a high variation as regards different nanoparticle species to cause cytotoxicity, DNA damage and oxidative DNA lesions. Toxic effects on cultured cells were assessed using trypan blue staining together with the comet assay to measure DNA damage and an oxidation-sensitive fluoroprobe to quantify the production of reactive oxygen species (Karlsson et al. 2008). Copper oxide was found to be the most toxic and therefore may pose the greatest health risk. Nanoparticulate ZnO and TiO2, both ingredients in sunscreens and cosmetics, showed cytotoxic and DNA-damaging effects. The potential mechanisms of toxicity for selected nanoparticles are listed in Table 14.2.\n",

The specific roles of surface capping, size scale and aspect ratio of ZnO particles towards antimicrobial activity and cytotoxicity have been investigated (Nair et al. 2009). Polyethylene glycol-capped ZnO nanoparticles demonstrated an increase in antimicrobial efficacy with a reduction in particle size. Again, gram negative bacteria were more affected than gram positive, which suggests that a membrane damage mechanism of action rather than one involving the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is of overriding significance. Polyethylene glycol-capped nanoparticles were highly toxic to human cells with a very low concentration (100 \u03bcM) threshold for cytotoxic action, whereas the concentration for antibacterial activity was 50 times greater (5 mM). It is hypothesised that the toxicity to eukaryotic cells is related to nanoparticle-enhanced apoptosis by up regulation of the Fas ligand on the cell membrane.",

Their use as constituents of prosthetic device coatings, topically applied agents and within dental materials is currently being explored. Future developments are likely to concentrate on those nanoparticles with maximal antimicrobial activity and minimal host toxicity. Antimicrobial nanoparticulate metals have received particular attention as a result of their durability. Although certain nanoparticles may be toxic to oral and other tissues, the surface characteristics of a given particle will determine whether or not it will have potential for oral applications. Approaches to alter biocompatibility and desired function are now being identified and include changing the ability to aggregate, application of surface coatings, and altering oxidative state and charge density.",
