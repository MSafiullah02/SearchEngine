Yet, these assemblies would possess excellent\nstructural mechanical properties. Additionally, a multitude of functions can be incorporated into the fibers and an extremely broad range of potential applications exists in which electrospun nanofibers can make major contributions. These include not only textile, ultrafiltration, tissue engineering, catalysis and mechanical reinforcement applications, but also extend to the fabrication of sensors, batteries and other types of devices. It would be meaningful to combine the electrospinning technique with controllable nanofibers assembly for sensors fabrication, as this would provide a simple, rapid and cheap way to construct ultrasensitive devices. Although the use of nanofibers offers the prospect of high sensitivity and rapid detection, the ability to incorporate nanofibers into device architectures is limited by the difficulty in manipulating and locating the nanostructures with respect to the microelectrodes.",

            "text": "Electrospun fibrous membranes typically have fiber diameters in the range 100\u2013500 nm, but properties such as surface area and porosity become more significant when the fiber diameter falls below 20 nm (Huang et al., 2006). The major challenge for developers is to come up with robust methods for manufacturing extremely small nanofibers in large quantities and with a uniform size. We have found a procedure for generating net-like structured nanowires with small diameters (~ 20 nm) in three-dimensional (3-D) fibrous mats by optimization of various processing parameters during electrospinning (Ding et al, 2006b). This novel process, termed \u2018electronetting\u2019, allows one-step fabrication of ultrathin \u2018nanonets\u2019 with large quantities and uniform size. The electrospun fibers act as a support for the soap-bubble-like structured nanonets comprising interlinked one-dimensional (1-D) nanowires (see Fig. 11.2\n). The major distribution region (over 70%) of nanowire diameters was in the range of 10\u201330 nm, which was one order of magnitude less than that of common electrospun nanofibers. The region of pore-width distribution of nanonets ranged from 20 to 550 nm, which was much less than that of pores among electrospun nanofibers. Therefore, nanonets possess great potential for application in filtration systems for the removal of particles or viruses with a size to nanometer ranges. To date, our group has successfully prepared various nanonets based on different polymer systems such as nylon-6 (Ding et al., 2006b), polyacrylic acid (PAA) (Ding et al., 2006b, Wang et al., 2010a), poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) (Ding et al., 2008b, Ding et al., 2010) and polyurethane (PU) (see Fig. 11.2). The formation of the nanonets is considered to be due to the electrically forced fast phase separation of the charged droplets which move at high speed between the capillary tip and the collector. The formation, morphology and area density of the nanonets in electrospun fibrous membranes are strongly affected by the solution properties and several parameters in the process of electrospinning.",

Furthermore, nanonets have the potential to be used as ultrafine filters to intercept viruses and bacteria, such as influenza A (H1N1) virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus, Escherichia coli, etc. (Ding et al., 2010). Clearly, there is growing interest in the process, but the results reported to date are primarily focused on the empirical production and the proposed uses of polymer nanofibers. At the same time, thorough understanding of the mechanisms of the breakup of liquid jet and subsequent nanonets formation is needed for the development of robust methods of process control.",

Nanometer cross-sections of nanomaterials gives them enhanced surface sensitivity and allows them to utilize the benefits of size effects, such as quantization and singlemolecule sensitivity. The comparatively large surface area and high porosity make electrospun nanomaterials highly attractive candidates for use in a range of devices, including ultrasensitive sensors. This is one of the most desirable properties for improving the sensitivity of sensors because a larger surface area will absorb more analytes and change the sensor\u2019s signal more significantly.

An interesting feature of this technique is that more sensing elements can be established on the surface of nanofibers, as well as more absorption sites exposed to analytes. To date, more than 100 types of natural and synthetic polymer have been electrospun into one-component nanofibers, such as poly(ethylene oxide), PVA, polystyrene (PS), polyacrylonitrile (PAN), polylactide, poly(\u03b5-caprolactone), PU, polyamide, cellulose acetate (CA), poly(vinyl acetate) (PVAc) and many more (Huang et al., 2003, Lu et al., 2009); however, only few of them were used as sensing elements (Ding et al., 2005b). Besides polymer-based sensing materials, nanostructured ceramics also have potential applications in nanoscale electronics, optical and sensing devices due to their notable electronic properties. The fabrication of sensing materials can be implemented over single-component electrospinning, but the remaining hindrance is that some polymers or ceramics cannot obtain nanostructured morphology via electrospinning directly (Wang et al., 2010a). A promising approach to solve this problem is to use composite or doped electrospinning and even assemble these materials on the surface of nanomaterials.",

In many cases, the composite fibers could be converted into metal-oxide fibers by subsequent calcination. Such composite fibers allow the fabrication of polymer fibers with special functionalities or of precursor fibers. For instance, Wang and coworkers (2006) obtained pure WO3 nanofibers with controllable diameters of around 100 nm by electrospinning PVAc/tungsten isopropoxide solutions and subsequent calcinations (see Fig. 11.4a, b\n). The prepared WO3 ceramic nanofibers have a quick response to ammonia in various concentrations, suggesting potential applications of the electrospun WO3 nanofibers as a sensor material for gas detection (Fig. 11.4c).",

However, most pure MOS are not stable in air and its electrical properties are significantly affected by adsorption of O2, CO2, hydrocarbons, S-containing compounds and water (Jimenez-Gonzalez, 1997). Therefore, it is highly desired to prepare 1-D MOS nanostructures doped with a selection of elements, such as Li, Ga, In, N, Al, Sn and P, to enhance and control their mechanical, electrical and optical performance. Electrospinning proved to be a simple, low-cost and reliable technique for dopant incorporation to attain modified structural, electrical and optical properties for these semiconducting nanofibers. Lotus and coworkers (2010) have investigated the effect of dopant addition on morphological, electrical and optical properties of semiconducting oxide nanofibers obtained by electrospinning. Pure SnO2 and SnO2 polycrystalline electrospun nanofibers doped with multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTS) are synthesized by Yang et al. (2007). The SnO2/ MWCNTS composite nanofibers exhibited enhanced sensitivity compared to pure SnO2 nanofibers. Doping with materials in the semiconductors may affect the electron transfer, which is considered in their investigation.",

            "text": "Another area that has been explored for the parallel immobilization of sensing materials over large areas of electrospun nanomaterials is the use of surface assembly. With bifunctional molecules an efficient surface modification can be achieved. A further development of this idea resulted in self-assembled monolayers (SAMs). Between neighboring adsorbed molecules, both hydrogen bonding and weak van der Waals forces are active (Tsukruk et al., 1997). The result is a densely packed layer of sensing molecules standing steeply at the surface. Interfaces functionalized by SAMs can be useful for electron transfer in the direct oxidation of organic substances, and they may also act as ion-selective surfaces. Assembly of sensing materials can also be driven by electrostatic interactions, resulting in layer-by-layer assembly (LBL) (Decher et al., 1992, Huang et al., 2001, Mamedov et al., 2002, Hammond, 2004). The LBL technique involves the alternate adsorption of anionic and cationic polyelectrolytes on a charged substrate by sequential dipping of the substrate into the appropriate aqueous polyelectrolyte solutions. This yields a highly tailored polymer thin film on the substrate. This technique effectively coated the individual electrospun fibers, thus leaving the inherent high surface area of the electrospun membrane intact (Ding et al., 2004a, Ding et al., 2005a, Ogawa et al., 2007). The LBL assembly technique has been successfully applied to sensor fabrication (Nohria et al., 2006). One of the amazing advantages of this technique is the versatility, in that a vast range of functional groups can be incorporated within the structure of the film. Furthermore, this technique is not limited to planar substrates and has been demonstrated in LBL assembly onto 2- and 3-D architectures (Kato et al., 2002). The combination of electrospinning and LBL assembly with different electrospun substrates and sensing layers or functionalities will afford new properties and tremendous flexibility for fabricating sensors. Wang et al. (2004) reported a sensitive optical sensor by assembling fluorescent probes onto electrospun CA nanofibers, which showed fluorescence quenching upon exposure to even an extremely low concentration (ppb) of methyl viologen cytochrome in aqueous solutions (see Fig. 11.5\n). There are also examples of self-assembling noble metal nanoparticles onto electrospun fibers (Formo et al., 2008, Huang et al., 2008). Li et al. (2006) have prepared silver nanoparticles deposited onto the surface of PAN nanofibers by photoreducing the desired metal salt directly. And, the solution route is also a generally simple and attractive approach for the fabrication of noble metal nanoparticles with a great level of control for both the size and dispersity onto the electrospun fibers.",

The essence of QCM as an analytical tool lies in its ability to detect small mass changes of even smaller than nanogram order deposited on crystal surface and to act as a sensor. Interfacial mass changes can be related to changes in the QCM oscillation frequency by applying Sauerbrey\u2019s equation (Sauerbrey, 1959):[11.1]\u0394f=\u22122o2\u0394ma\u03bc\u03c11/2\n",

            "text": "In the past decade, QCMs have been widely explored as sensors for the detection of biomarkers, drug targets, virus capsids, bacteria and living cells. Up to now, a variety of materials such as metals, ceramics, polymers, selfassembled monolayers, dendrimers, lipids and waxes (Ricco et al., 1998, Grate, 2000) have been employed as sensitive coatings on QCM to improve the sensor sensitivity and selectivity for chemical analytes. It is widely accepted that the sensitivity of QCM sensors toward a specific analyte is enhanced by increasing the specific surface area of the sensing materials (Kolmakov and Moskovits, 2004). Recent efforts have been focused on the development of nanostructured coatings on QCM to improve the sensor sensitivity (Ding et al., 2004b, Chao et al., 2007). We have demonstrated the possibilities of fabricating novel QCM sensors by electrospinning deposition of nanofibrous membranes as sensitive coatings on the electrodes of QCM. Taking advantage of the large specific surface area, high porosity and good interconnectivity of these electrospun fibrous assemblies, we have successfully detected NH3 (Ding et al., 2004b, Ding et al., 2005b), H2S (Ding et al., 2006a), formaldehyde (Wang et al., 2010a), moisture (Wang et al., 2010b) and trimethylamine (TMA) (Wang et al., 2011) with new detection limits at room temperature. Sensing experiments were carried out at room temperature in a flow-type gas testing system (Ding et al., 2005b) and a static-type gas testing system (Fig. 11.6a\n) by measuring the resonance frequency shifts of QCM due to the additional mass loading. The experiments indicated that the sensitivity of the fibrous membrane-coated QCM sensors was several times higher than that of the casting film-coated QCM sensors. Moreover, the fiber-coated QCM sensors with small average fiber diameter had a higher sensitivity. One exciting and challenging aspect of the work of our group lies in the fabrication of a novel TMA sensor by using an electronetting technique to deposit a PAA nanonets on a QCM (Wang et al., 2011). The versatile nanonets created enhanced interconnectivity and additional surface area, and facilitated the diffusion of analytes into the membranes, which significantly boosted the gas diffusion coefficient and sensing properties (Fig. 11.6b). These proof-of-principle experiments demonstrate the possibility of using electrospinning techniques to regulate the structure of membranes and hence obtain high surface activity and gas sensitivity; further experiments using more complex fiber arrangements and structures should expand the capabilities of this platform.",

The change in electrical conductivity or mass of the sensing layer perturbs the velocity of the propagating SAWs due to mechanical and piezoelectric effects. Concentrated efforts have been focused on depositing nanostructured coatings on SAWs via electrospray or electrospinning technique to improve the sensor sensitivity (Sarkar et al., 2006, He et al., 2010, Li et al., 2010). For example, He et al. (2010) demonstrated that a novel H2 sensor could be prepared by electrospinning deposition of poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP)/ LiTaO3 composite nanofiber on the electrodes of SAWs. Upon exposure to H2, the PVP fibers adsorb H2 molecules due to the hydrogen bond and the mass increase. Therefore, the frequency of the SAW device decreases as the adsorbed molecules reduce the acoustic wave velocity (Fig. 11.7\n). This indicates that the electrospinning technique can afford a simple approach for the fabrication of composite nanomaterials for sensing technology.",

Significant progress has been achieved in developing highly sensitive MOS resistive sensors using novel 1-D nanostructured architectures such as TiO2, SnO2, ZnO, In2O3, WO3 and other wide band gap metal oxides. The fundamental principle of these devices is associated primarily with the adsorption of the chemisorbed species on the surface of the MOS inducing electric charge transport between the two materials, which changes the resistance of the oxide. 1-D sensing architectures provide unparalleled advantages in terms of facilitating fast mass transfer of the analyte molecules to and from the interaction region, as well as requiring charge carriers to traverse any barriers introduced by molecular recognition events along the entire wire. Among the variety of methods for the preparation of such nanostructured architectures, electrospinning is one of the most simple, versatile and cost-effective approaches, offering the ability to produce long, continuous organic or inorganic nanofibers with potential for alignment and spooling.",

The sensor response was measured between 260 \u00b0C and 380 \u00b0C by comparing the resistance of the sensor in dry synthetic air with that in target gases. Extremely fast response-recovery behavior (~ 3 s) has been obtained at the operable temperature of 320 \u00b0C, based on the prepared sensor, with the detection limit of approximate 5 ppm H2.

The enhancement of photoresponse behaviors arising from the excitation of the surface plasmon is attributed to the generation of hot electrons. The generated hot electrons drift or diffuse to the oxide barrier and tunnel to the counterelectrode. Generation of hot electrons and electron tunneling through the oxide nanowires may contribute to the enhanced photoresponse behavior in the hybrid nanowire (Hu et al., 2006). Recently, Shi and coworkers (2009) have developed a method to fabricate Au nanoparticles (AuNPs) embedded in silica nanofibers via electrospinning and thermal decomposition of hybrid nanofibers, which exhibited an obvious photoelectric response under illumination (Fig. 11.9a\n). Photoelectric response measurements were conducted under dark condition or under alternate light illuminations of different wavelengths (k\n = 410, 550 or 680 nm). Data were obtained by an electrochemical analyzer with applied constant voltage of 10 V every 5 min. Upon light illumination, the hybrid peapod nanofibers presented a wavelength-dependent photoelectric current response. Particularly, the current photoresponse reached a maximum value under illumination at a wavelength of 550 nm, which was close to the surface-plasmon-resonance absorption band of the AuNPs nanofibers (Fig. 11.9b). These results show the potential of using gold nanopeapodded silica nanowires as wavelength-controlled optical nanoswitches. The microreactor approach can be applied to the preparation of a range of hybrid metal-dielectric 1-D nanostructures that can be used as functional building blocks for nanoscale waveguiding devices, sensors and optoelectronics.",

Electron-deficient metal cations such as Fe3 + or Hg2 + and nitro aromatic compounds such as 2,4-dinitrotoluene (DNT) and 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene can serve as quenchers for a fluorophore (Wang et al., 2002b, Wang et al., 2002c). The pyrene methanol (PM) (Wang et al., 2002a) and conjugated polymers (Long et al, 2009) were chosen as fluorescent indicators due to their large Stokes shift, high quantum yield, strong absorbance, excellent photostability and lifetime. Here the quenching of fluorescence is due to the interactions of an electron-rich indicator and electron-deficient quencher, and the degree of quenching depends on the amount of analyte. Electrospinning was used as a novel and simple method to fabricate fluorescent optical sensors. Wang and coworkers (2002b) have successfully developed nanofibrous PAA-PM membrane optical sensors for metal ion (Fe3 + or Hg2 +) and DNT detection using the electrospinning technique. Recently, electrospun nanofibrous PS film doped with a fluorescent conjugated polymer was developed as a sensory device for detection of the explosive DNT (Fig. 11.10a, b\n) (Long et al., 2009). Polymer acting as a fluorescence probe presented relatively large affinity for the nitroaromatic compound DNT, which is mainly based on photoinduced charge transfer and \u03d6-\u03d6 stacking interaction and could provide a strong driving force for fast fluorescence quenching. Second, the electrospun nanofibrous sensing film possessed remarkable specific surface area, in which more recognition elements were located on the surface.",

The dual chromo- and fluorogenic responses of the nanofibrous membrane upon exposure to HCl gas are interpreted in terms of the out-of-plane distortion of porphyrin macrocycle, which ultimately affects its optical properties. Exposing the PPI nanofibrous membrane to HCl gas for only 10 s generates a fast color change (from reddish russet to green) on the sensor surface, which can be ascribed to the protonation of the neutral porphyrin moieties in PPI. It is notable that the intensity of green color increases with the concentration of HCl gas (5\u2013100 ppm). Additionally, the reusability of this PPI nanofibrous membrane sensor is proved by color recovery after puffing with N2 for a certain time.",

The mechanism of FTIR sensor is based on the fact that different functional groups within a compound absorb radiation at different frequencies and yield unique infrared absorbance spectra. The large band width (400\u20134500 cm\u2212 1) and the distinct absorbance bands render FTIR technology suitable for sensor applications. Hahn et al. (Luoh and Hahn, 2006) first utilized the electrospun nanocomposite PAN/oxide fiber mats as optical sensors in conjunction with FTIR spectroscopy to detect CO2 gas. The absorbance spectra showed a higher sensitivity with a fiber mat, regardless of its type, than without, indicating gas adsorption on the fiber mat.",

Among those devices, amperometric glucose biosensors, with glucose oxidase (GOx) and without GOx, have been an intensively investigated research area because a low detection limit can be achieved easily. Ren et al. (2006) have developed an amperometric biosensor by electrospinning deposition of nanofibrous GOx/PVA membranes as sensitive coatings on the surface of the Au electrode. Chronoamperometric measurements demonstrated that electrospun fibrous enzymatic electrodes exhibited a rapid response (1 s) and a higher response current (l \u03bcA level) to glucose in the normal and diabetic level. The linear response range (from 1 to 10 mM) and the lower detection limit (0.05 mM) of the sensor are satisfying. The electrospun method makes it convenient and efficient to prepare the enzymatic electrode for biosensors.",

The biosensor was assembled by attaching the three membrane pads (application pad, capture pad and absorption pad) onto the polyvinylidene chloride substrate as shown in Fig. 11.11a\n. Figure 11.11b shows the pathogen detection principle of the biosensor. The electrospun biosensor exhibits a linear response to both microbial samples, the E. coli O157:H7 and BVDV. The detection time of the biosensor is 8 min, and the detection limit is 61 CFU/mL and 103 CCID/mL for bacterial and viral samples, respectively (see Fig. 11.11c, d). With the advantage of efficient antibody functionalization, excellent capillary capability and relatively low cost, the electrospinning process and surface functionalization method can be implemented to produce nanofibrous capture membranes for different immunodetection applications.",

It is obvious that the current research has focused on seeking the possible applications of these resultant nanofibers with broad functionalities. The utilization of electrospun nanofibers with a large specific surface as sensing materials has received great attention since 2004. The fine structure of electrospun fibers makes them excellent candidates to replace the current widely used solid flat membranes, promising to further increase sensor sensitivity; this opens a new way to fabricate ultrasensitive sensors (Ding et al., 2009). It is important to note that the application of electrospun nanomaterials for sensors still faces many challenges. Preparation of sensing materials in the form of nanostructures may significantly improve their performances in the existing devices or open doors to new types of applications. However, integration of nanomaterials into sensors requires materials of well-controlled orientation, size and other target characteristics, as well as reproducibility locating them in specific positions and orientations. The ability to achieve this, however, remains a major challenge in the field (Frenot and Chronakis, 2003). Fortunately, several approaches have emerged that promise to bridge these gaps and realize the vision of upgraded nanosensors. Given the versatility of electrospinning for generating fibrous membranes with various nanostructures, it is likely that electrospinning will be one of the most significant nanotechnologies in the fabrication of more and more ultrasensitive and practical sensors.",
