Several explanations could account for this unexpected trend. One possible explanation is that by directly addressing COVID-19, participants from the FL may have felt a greater sense of control of their situation; control in the workplace is thought to be a major driver of engagement and important for avoiding burnout. (22, 25, 28) Those working in their usual wards may have perceived less control over new policies and procedures enacted to keep staff and patients safe, and in contrast to facing COVID-19 head-on, these workers may have had a sense that the virus could impact their workplace at any time, regardless of those policies. Additionally, cancer patients are particularly vulnerable to viral infection, and the COVID-19 pandemic has frequently necessitated suspension of cancer treatment and clinical trials;(4, 29) these situations may add additional workplace stress to oncology professionals working in their UW. (13, 30, 31) It is also possible that those at the FL may have felt closer to the key decision makers, and may have had access to more timely and accurate information.(25, 28, 32) Personal accomplishment, a key dimension of burnout that is often neglected in studies of health care workers but is receiving increasing recognition, (22, 33) may have also played a role: the FL staff may have felt a deeper sense of personal achievement as they saw the direct results of their care for patients affected by the COVID-19 crisis, and ultimately saw the abatement of the epidemic in Wuhan.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 497, "end": 501, "text": "(22,", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 502, "end": 505, "text": "25,", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 506, "end": 509, "text": "28)", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 1108, "end": 1112, "text": "(13,", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1113, "end": 1116, "text": "30,", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 1117, "end": 1120, "text": "31)", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 1439, "end": 1443, "text": "(22,", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 1444, "end": 1447, "text": "33)", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 123, "end": 132, "text": "(Table 1)", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Much attention is paid to those who work directly with infected patients.

Given the known detrimental impact of burnout on patient care and health care worker well-being, (34) (35) (36) (37) (38) our results suggest that the well-being of staff working in their usual workplace may be negatively impacted by the pandemic, and is deserving of future attention and additional research.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 74, "end": 78, "text": "(11,", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 79, "end": 82, "text": "12)", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 591, "end": 595, "text": "(34)", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 596, "end": 600, "text": "(35)", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 601, "end": 605, "text": "(36)", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 606, "end": 610, "text": "(37)", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 611, "end": 615, "text": "(38)", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "The workers surveyed here all hailed from the oncology specialty.

(40) This study has several limitations. First, the study utilized a small group size stemming from the medical staff of a single institution. Second, although participants were assured of their anonymity, worry about identification may have caused participants to score low on burnout questions. Moreover, even with an 86% response rate, selection bias may also have skewed our results if either highly distressed staff members or those who felt little distress chose not to participate. Finally, it is important to note that our survey was conducted in March 2020, when COVID-19 was generally considered to be under control in China; our study has no way to ascertain the burnout status of medical staff members at the onset or peak period of Wuhan's COVID-19 crisis.
