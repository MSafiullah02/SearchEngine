Stewart announced that the time had come for researchers to turn their attention from infectious diseases to chronic ailments such as cancer and heart disease. This \u201ccomfort zone\u201d was shattered in the 1980s with the emergence of new diseases and the reemergence of those once considered historic.5 Since then, numerous efforts have been made to investigate the extent of the situation and to consider measures to contain or combat it.",

The committee also identified various contributing factors, such as human behavior, travel and mass movements of individuals, civil unrest and wars, and, especially, genomic changes and adaptations.

The IOM outlined several factors contributing to microbial spread, which officials at IOM, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the World Health Organization, and other health agencies are attempting to halt by limiting antimicrobial use, by pouring money into global health funds, by establishing international surveillance networks and, in severe instances, by limiting travel.10\n",

Anything which degrades their quality of life\u2014demographic pressures, diminished access to or stock of resources, and so on\u2014is a security threat.\u201d12 Human security is seen to differ in three ways from the traditional concept of security: (1) the individual rather than the state is the main agent of analysis; (2) the emphasis is on unstructured chaos and turmoil as the chief challenge to global stability rather than on structured, militarized interstate violence; and (3) the potential for individual/communitarian cooperation is based on cooperation that achieves the good of all rather than on interactions in which one party \u201cwins\u201d at the expense of the other(s).13 The threat to this concept of human security is depicted by Browers and Chalk in six specific aspects, as reviewed below.13\n",

Two examples of this concern can be provided. The threat of the anthrax attacks in the United States in the fall of 2001 was accompanied by a lack of coordination at the federal level, which led to a loss of confidence among some citizens, particularly postal workers. Additionally, other responses were misguided (eg, the purchase by the general public of Cipro\u00ae [Bayer, West Haven, CT]the antibiotic approved for treating anthrax, in large numbers). Another example was provided by the severe food poisoning epidemic caused by Escherichia coli 0157 that occurred in Japan in 1996, when the perceived inability of the Tokyo government to initiate an appropriate response led to widespread public criticism of an administration that already was reeling from the effects of the previous year\u2019s Kobe earthquake.",

Another example is the reaction in the Gulu district of Uganda, where the outbreak of Ebola in late 2000 led to a complete withdrawal of the populace from the outside world, such that common societal interactions and functions were reduced to a bare minimum. Adverse psychological as well as societal consequences have been associated with the emotional stress suffered during times of such withdrawal, continual subjection to poor sanitary conditions, and outbreaks of diseases.17\n",

The costs of outbreaks can be staggering and can compromise or even retard economic development processes, particularly in developing countries. One result is the diminished size of the workforce when an epidemic occurs. Particularly in developing countries, productivity hampered by a handicapped workforce can have a seriously adverse effect on the national economy. As has occurred especially with HIV/AIDS, the incidence of new cases disproportionately affects developing countries, in which 90 percent of such cases are found. Because HIV/AIDS affects primarily individuals in their prime economic productive years, the consequences to the local, regional, and national economies can be devastating.3 Also, because this population is in its child-bearing years, the socioeconomic consequences include a huge number of children and adolescents who are left orphans when the parents succumb to AIDS, leaving the responsibility of their children\u2019s care to extended family members, many of whom already are ill themselves or unable to bear the burden psychologically or financially. Beyond the strain on the family is the social consequence of adolescents and even children resorting to prostitution as a means of survival, thereby increasing their risks of acquiring and/or transmitting HIV and other infectious diseases.",

In 1990, the number of displaced persons worldwide was estimated to be 30 million. When individuals are displaced, they often must resort to using temporary living quarters such as refugee camps and temporary shelters, both of which are harbingers of diseases and share the risk factors associated with other ideal environments for emerging infectious diseases and re-emerging infectious diseases: crowding, limited access to medical care, lack of clean water and food, and inadequate barriers for disease-carrying agents.22 A prime example is the migration of 500,000 to 800,000 Rwandan refugees into Zaire in 1994. In this incident, cholera and Shigella dysenteriae type 1 swept through the refugee camp, killing almost 50,000 refugees during the first month of their displacement.22\n",

Generally, vero cells and continuous mosquito cell lines are used. Intracerebral inoculation of suckling mice is a sensitive system that has been used in reference laboratories to isolate the virus. Direct detection of viral genomic sequences from CSF is highly sensitive. Detection of virus-specific IgM in serum is presumptive evidence of recent infection, and the presence of IgM in the CSF confirms that the patient has had recent infection. Confirmation also can be established by demonstrating four-fold or greater changes in antibody titer by hemaglutination, complement fixation, immunofluorescence, or neutralization. The most specific is neutralization antibody assay, which in most cases must be performed to establish the diagnosis.",

The overall mortality rate for meningoencephalitis has ranged from 4 to 14 percent, with rates generally being higher among the elderly.26 Neurologic signs may manifest initially, or they may develop after the initial \u201cflue-like\u201d prodrome. Neurologic infection also may result in aseptic meningitis, an encephalitis syndrome including changes in mental status, cranial nerve and bulbar palsies, motor weakness, abnormal reflexes, and myelitis. Optic neuritis and polyradiculitis and plyneuropathy with elements of axonal degeneration have been reported, as have generalized weakness that resembles that of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome and polio-like flaccid paralysis that appears to result from cell damage of the anterior horn. Persistent weakness, memory loss, and movement disorders, may develop in as many as 30 percent of survivors.26 The case fatality rate in neurologic cases is 10 percent. Other complications include myocarditis, pancreatitis, and fatal hepatitis. Peripheral leudopenia and lymphocytosis are common findings.35\n",
