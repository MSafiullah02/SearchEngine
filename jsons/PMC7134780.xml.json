Previously, the southeast region, including Shanghai and the Pearl River Delta, had been enveloped in extreme haze; and before that, a similar situation occurred in northern China.1 Haze continues to wreak havoc throughout the country. Meanwhile, human infection with avian influenza A H7N9 virus reemerged during January 2014 and has led to 31 deaths.2 This number is almost as high as for all of 2013; more unfortunately, the attack rate of H7N9 infection was highly sporadic.",

Researchers have explained that PM2.5 contains toxic chemicals and microparticles that attach to pathogenic microorganisms. When people are exposed to haze, PM2.5 can penetrate deeply into the lungs through the respiratory tract due to its small size, thus decreasing the resistance of lung tissue to pathogenic microorganisms and thereby increasing the risk of respiratory disease.5 Dr Hongzhou Lu (deputy director of the Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center for H7N9 bird flu) has declared that the recent hazy conditions increase the risk of respiratory infection, including H7N9, but do not directly result in the proliferation of viruses. Likewise, data from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention did not show severe acute respiratory syndrome or influenza virus outbreaks in the Chinese population during 2013, the worst year of haze in more than half a century in China. Despite the fact that haze-associated respiratory infection is not as serious as severe acute respiratory syndrome, a wide range, long duration, and high frequency of haze occurrence, coupled with its long-term effects, will bring new challenges to the Chinese medical community in the future.",
