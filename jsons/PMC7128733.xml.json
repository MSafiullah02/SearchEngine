Furthermore, the Japanese Society of Pediatric Pulmonology and Japanese Society for Pediatric Infectious Diseases announced the \u201cGuidelines for the Management of Respiratory Infectious Diseases in Children in Japan\u201d. Internationally, many guidelines, including those established by the American Thoracic Society and Infectious Diseases Society of America, have been published from various countries. Thereafter, clinical research on respiratory infectious diseases has advanced, leading to the accumulation of many outcomes regarding epidemiology, clinical diagnosis, and treatment. However, the types of microorganisms that cause respiratory infectious diseases have increased with the number of resistant bacteria. In addition, conditions have also varied with causative microorganisms through the recent compromised host's severe status. The place of treatment varies: from the outpatient clinic to the ICU. Physicians responsible for treatment also vary: practitioners, hospital doctors, pulmonologists, emergency physicians, board certified member of JAID, Japanese antimicrobial chemotherapy physician. There are a large number of options of antimicrobial drugs that are available, including new drugs; therapeutic strategies are confused. On the other hand, recently, the entity of PK-PD has been commonly recognized, and the importance of scientifically using antimicrobial drugs has been emphasized. In addition, the Japanese Society of Chemotherapy established a system for antimicrobial chemotherapy-certified physicians, and promoted the widespread, adequate use of antimicrobial drugs. Based on these, the two societies prepared the JAID/JSC Guidelines for the Treatment of Respiratory Infectious Diseases. If specific treatment guidelines can be presented, this may contribute to an improvement in the treatment responses of respiratory infectious diseases, a reduction in health expenditure, and the prevention of resistant bacteria.",

To prepare the guidelines, a committee was established in 2012, and a draft was published on homepage based on an approval from the boards of directors at the two societies through a review-based consensus. Opinions were collected from the two societies' members. In Japan, there have been no such guidelines covering respiratory infectious diseases. In the future, with further advances in research, the contents of the guidelines must be revised. However, we successfully provided treatment guidelines that are the most advanced at present.",

They do not limit treatment by individual physicians or affect their rights to select it. The guidelines may be commonly applied for respiratory infectious disease management/research/education in Japan, improving the quality of respiratory infectious disease management, preventing an increase in the number of resistant bacteria, and contributing to national health. We hope that the guidelines will be utilized by a large number of clinicians in respiratory infectious disease management. Lastly, we thank the committee members and secretariat staff for their cooperation.1.Descriptions on the recommendation grade and evidence level\n\n2.Definition of first- and second-choice drugs\n\n3.Precautions-In this article, with respect to the administration method (especially doses) of antimicrobial drugs, they are recommended based on sufficient doses. Considering the products adopted at each medical institution, antibiograms, severity, underlying disease, age, and presence or absence of organ disorder, the dose should be increased or decreased if necessary.-The spectra of third-generation cephems for intravenous injection, CTX and CTRX, are similar, but CTX, which is excreted in the kidney, should be primarily used when liver dysfunction is present, and CTRX, which is excreted in bile, should be primarily used when renal dysfunction is present.-As quinolones exhibit antitubercular actions, patients with pulmonary tuberculosis should be excluded for use.\n4.A list of antimicrobial drug abbreviations and doses for neonates are presented at the end of this volume.\n",

Although Legionella pneumonia is routinely classified as atypical pneumonia, various types of atypical pneumonia do not include Legionella pneumonia in this differentiation method.a.Bacterial pneumonia(1)Outpatient treatmentBacterial pneumonia is primarily caused by Sterptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis\n[1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [13], [14] (II). Basically, these types of pneumonia should be treated by orally administering high-dose penicillin [1], [2], [3], [4] (AII). In Japan, macrolide-resistant S. pneumoniae is detected in most cases; therefore, macrolides are not recommended as the first choice, differing form those in Europe and the United States [4], [5], [10], [13], [14] (AII).For outpatient treatment, \u03b2-lactamase inhibitor-containing penicillin is commonly used. Therapy with CVA/AMPC or SBTPC (2 tablets/3\u20134 times a day) is recommended with respect to the efficacy and suppression of resistant bacteria [1], [4], [11] (AII). However, such high-dose prescriptions are not always accepted by health insurance system in Japan, and the following prescriptions (examples) should also be considered.In elderly patients or those with underlying lung diseases such as COPD/old pulmonary tuberculosis, the use of respiratory quinolones should be considered positively from the perspective of the effects on penicillin-resistant Pneumococcus and tissue transfer [11], [14], [15] (BII). However, many new quinolones also have antimicrobial activities against Mycobacterium tuberculosis; therefore, the presence or absence of active tuberculosis must be strictly checked before administration [16] (AII).(2)Hospital treatmentFor hospital treatment, injection is primarily used. However, basic concepts for drug selection are similar to those at the outpatient clinic. Considering S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, and M. catarrhalis, high-dose penicillin or cephems, which are effective for these microorganisms, should be selected [1], [2], [3], [4] (AII). If more potent treatment is required, respiratory quinolone injection should be used [15], [17] (BII).\n\n",

To suppress resistant bacteria, respiratory quinolones should be reserved as alternative drugs [1], [4], [11], [12], [18] (BII).However, recently, the appearance of macrolide-resistant M. pneumoniae in adults has raised an issue in Japan. Respiratory quinolones must be used as the first choice depending on local circumstances about drug resistance [18] (CIII).(2)Hospital treatmentFor hospital treatment, injection is primarily used. However, basic concepts for drug selection are similar to those at the outpatient clinic. If more potent treatment is required, new quinolone injection should be used [1], [2], [3], [4], [11], [15], [17] (BII).\n\n",

Recently, the appearance of macrolide-resistant M. pneumoniae in adults has raised an issue. Respiratory quinolones may be used as the first choice depending on local circumstances about drug resistance [18] (CIII).(2)Hospital treatmentFor hospital treatment, injection is primarily used. However, basic concepts for drug selection are similar to those at the outpatient clinic. If more potent treatment is required, new quinolone injection should be used [1], [2], [3], [4], [11], [15] (BII).(3)Severer cases requiring treatment in the ICUIn severer cases requiring treatment in the ICU, S. pneumoniae should be initially considered, and a macrolide or new quinolone should be used aggressively in combination with a broad spectrum \u03b2-lactam such as high-dose penicillin from the beginning of treatment primarily to cover latent atypical bacteria (in particular, when L. pneumophila is not covered, the condition may become fatal) [1], [2], [3], [4], [11], [17], [18] (AII). In particular, combination therapy with a macrolide is recommended from immunological aspects to suppress excessive inflammation related to cytokines [19] (CII).As the possibility that causative microorganisms may be enteric bacteria including ESBL-producing bacteria cannot be ruled out, carbapenem injection should be used as a first-choice drug in patients with a background factor for which ESBL-producing bacteria are frequently detected [11], [20] (BII).The sensitivity of a urinary antigen kit to S. pneumoniae and Legionella spp. is approximately 60%. Therefore, even when the patient is negative for these bacteria in the initial phase, the possibility of pneumonia related to these bacteria should not be ruled out [1], [2], [3], [4], [8], [9] (II).\n\n",

            "text": "- - - Explanation- - -a.\nStreptococcus pneumoniae\n-The Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) has established higher criteria for breakpoints for penicillin susceptibility on the administration of parenteral antimicrobial drugs for S. pneumoniae infections other than meningitis [23], based on the following findings: patients with severe pneumonia due to S. pneumoniae with a low PCG susceptibility (MIC: 0.12\u20134 \u03bcg/mL) showed no difference in responses to PCG and outcome [24], [25] (II). For the treatment of pneumococcal pneumonia, the dose of penicillin should be increased [23], [26] (A).-In Japan, most S. pneumoniae isolates are macrolide resistant [13], [22].-Respiratory quinolones have potent anti-pneumococcal activities (III). The clinical effects of such quinolones are similar to those of high-dose AMPC [27] (II).-In Japan, quinolone-resistant S. pneumoniae is detected in 2\u20133% of the isolates [13]. As quinolone resistance may be readily induced by point mutations of DNA gyrase or topoisomerase genes [28], quinolones must be used adequately (AIII).\nb.\nHaemophilus influenzae\n-The ABPC-resistant mechanism of H. influenzae involves \u03b2-lactamase production and/or PBP mutation. Previously, \u03b2-lactamase production was primarily involved, but, recently, PBP mutation-mediated \u03b2-lactamase-negative ABPC-resistant (BLNAR) strains have been increasingly detected. ABPC-resistant strains with both \u03b2-lactamase production and PBP mutation are classified as \u03b2-lactamase-positive CVA/ABPC-resistant (BLPACR) strains.-According to a national survey in Japan, 49 (39.8%) and 7 (5.7%) of 123 H. influenzae strains were BLNAR and \u03b2-lactamase-producing strains, respectively [13].-BLNAR strains are also resistant to first- and second-generation cephems.-PIPC exhibits an antimicrobial activity against BLNAR strains. However, it is ineffective for BLPACR strains.\nc.\nKlebsiella spp., Escherichia coli, Proteus spp.-The proportion of extended spectrum \u03b2-lactamase (ESBL)-producing bacteria has slightly increased among isolates from respiratory samples.-According to a national survey in Japan, ESBL-producing bacteria account for 1.8\u20133.4% of respiratory sample-derived Klebsiella spp. strains [13], [29].-Most ESBL-producing strains are simultaneously resistant to quinolones [30]. Antimicrobials should be selected according to the drug susceptibility of isolated bacteria.-In Japan, carbapenemase-producing strains are extremely rare.\nd.\nMycoplasma pneumoniae\n-In the field of pediatrics, the detection rate of macrolide-resistant M. pneumoniae has markedly increased. In adults, that of macrolide-resistant M. pneumoniae also increase [31], [32].-Tetracyclines exhibit potent clinical effects on macrolide-resistant M. pneumoniae\n[33].-Respiratory quinolones have good activities against M. pneumoniae\n[34], [35].\ne.\nLegionella spp.-It should be noted that pneumonia related to Legionella spp. other than L. pneumophila SG1 cannot be diagnosed using Legionella urinary antigen testing.-As neither \u03b2-lactams nor aminoglycosides have antimicrobial activities against Legionella spp., which proliferates within host cells, they are clinically ineffective.-Quinolones, macrolides, and tetracyclines have been confirmed to exhibit clinical effects on Legionella spp. Previously, EM was the first choice for this infection, but many recent studies have showed the clinical efficacies of LVFX and AZM [36], [37].-RFP is effective when combined with EM. The combination of EM and RFP is useful. A study suggested the effects of combination therapy with LVFX and a macrolide [38] (CIII).-Although there are no marked differences in antimicrobial drug susceptibility among Legionella spp., clinical reviews to verify this are limited [39].\nf.\nChlamydophila pneumoniae\n-Only a few studies have supported the clinical effects of antimicrobial drugs against C. pneumoniae pulmonary infections.-Tetracyclines, macrolides, and quinolones may be effective. These drugs are recommended primarily based on the results of basic studies [34], [40].\ng.\nStaphylococcus aureus\n-With respect to Staphylococcus aureus in Japan, there has been an increase in the number of methicillin-resistant strains even in patients with community-acquired pneumonia. In particular, recently, municipal-onset-type MRSA (CA-MRSA) with Panton-Valentine-Leucocidine (PVL) has been detected in Japan, raising an issue [41].-In cases of MSSA infection (bacteremia), the clinical effects of CEZ are superior to those of VCM [42].-As the susceptibility of MRSA to oral antimicrobial drugs differs among isolates, drugs should be selected according to its drug susceptibility Results.\nh.\nStreptococcus spp.-Among various types of Streptococcus, the Streptococcus anginosus group is frequently detected, and characterized by strong abscess-forming features [43]. Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus agalactiae may also cause pneumonia. The former may lead to serious pulmonary infection [44] (V).-There is no penicillin resistance, but macrolide resistance is observed at a low frequency [45].-The anti-Streptococcus activities of quinolones vary. Among quinolones, GRNX, MFLX, and STFX have relatively potent antimicrobial activities [13], [46].\ni.\nMoraxella catarrhalis\n-The number of \u03b2-lactamase- producing strains has increased since the 1990's. Currently, most strains produce \u03b2-lactamase [13], [47].-\u03b2-lactamase produced by M. catarrhalis decomposes penicillin.-In Japan, macrolide- or quinolone- resistance have not been reported [13].\nj.Anaerobes-Most anaerobes that cause pneumonia exist in the oral cavity. Peptostreptococcus spp., Prevotella spp., and Fusobacterium spp. are involved. Mixed infection with microaerophilic Streptococci is often observed.-In many cases, infection with anaerobes may be associated with aspiration.-Most oral anaerobes (Prevotella spp., Fusobacterium spp., and Porphyromonas spp.) are susceptible to combination drugs consisting of penicillin and a \u03b2-lactamase inhibitor, CLDM and MNZ [48].\nk.\nPseudomonas aeruginosa\n-In patients with chronic respiratory tract infection, Pseudomonas aeruginosa colonizes in the airway, and may cause community-acquired pneumonia [49].-As the susceptibility of P. aeruginosa to antimicrobial drugs differs among clinical isolates, drugs should be selected according to its drug susceptibility results.\n\n",

Although it is difficult to estimate/identify causative microorganisms using sputum samples, bacteria that are not isolated/cultured from good-quality sputum may not be causative microorganisms. If resistant bacteria such as MRSA and P. aeruginosa are not detected on sputum culture and there is no deterioration of clinical symptoms, an initial drug should be continued [50] (BIII). In patients in whom aspiration episodes are clear, those in whom oral hygiene is not maintained, or those with consciousness disorder, drugs with anti-anaerobe activities should be selected, considering the involvement of anaerobes [50] (BIII). If an adequate antimicrobial drug is administered, the treatment period may be 7\u201310 days, excluding MRSA and P. aeruginosa\n[50], [53] (BII).\u2666First choices-SBT/ABPC, intravenous drip, 3 g/3\u20134 times a day-CTX, intravenous drip, 1\u20132 g/3 times a day-CTRX, intravenous drip, 2 g/once a day or 1 g/twice a day\u2217If the involvement of anaerobes is suspected, SBT/ABPC should be selected.\n\n<>Second choice-LVFX, intravenous drip, 500 mg/once a day (As its antimicrobial activity against anaerobes is weak, monotherapy with this drug should be avoided in patients with aspiration pneumonia.).\n\nb.Cases in which there is a risk of multi-drug-resistant bacteria (Table 3) [51]\n\nTo cover multi-drug-resistant bacteria including P. aeruginosa, broad-spectrum antimicrobial drugs with anti-P. aeruginosa activities should be selected [50], [51], [52] (AIII). Considering the frequency of ESBL in each institution, carbapenems should be considered even when enteric bacteria, including Klebsiella spp. and Escherichia coli, are suspected (BIV). If P. aeruginosa is not isolated on good-quality sputum culture, a treatment option should be de-escalated to drugs for cases in which there is no risk of resistant bacteria [50], [51], [52] (AII). If aspiration is suspected, or if the involvement of gram-positive bacteria is suggested, combination therapy with CLDM must be considered (BIV). If there is a risk of MRSA carrier (Table 4\n), combination therapy with anti-MRSA drugs should also be considered.The mean administration period of antimicrobial drugs with respect to causative bacteria in patients with an improvement was approximately 10 days. However, that for resistant bacteria such as P. aeruginosa and MRSA was approximately 12 days [53] (BII). If appropriate antimicrobial drugs can be administered after clarifying causative bacteria, a treatment period of approximately 10 days is recommended [53], [56], [57] (BII).\u2666First choices-TAZ/PIPC, intravenous drip, 4.5 g/3\u20134 times a day-IPM/CS, intravenous drip, 0.5 g/4 times a day or 1 g/3 times a day-MEPM, intravenous drip, 1 g/3 times a day-DRPM, intravenous drip, 0.5\u20131 g/3 times a day-BIPM, intravenous drip, 0.3\u20130.6 g/3\u20134 times a day\n<>Second choices-CFPM, intravenous drip, 1\u20132 g/2\u20134 times a day-CPFX, intravenous drip, 300 mg/twice a day-PZFX, intravenous drip, 500 to 1000 mg/twice a dayIf the involvement of anaerobes is suspected, one of the following options should be combined with one of the above regimens:-CLDM, intravenous drip, 600 mg/2\u20134 times a day-SBT/ABPC, intravenous drip, 3 g/3\u20134 times a day\n\nc.Severe casesOne of the following options must be combined with one of the regimens for cases in which there is a risk of multi-drug-resistant bacteria. When comparing the results between patients undergoing appropriate and inappropriate treatments, the prognosis of the latter was significantly poorer [58], [59] (BII). However, a study reported that the prognosis in a group with compliance with recommended drug selection was significantly poorer than in a non-compliance group in patients in whom infection with drug-resistant bacteria in the ICU was suspected even among those in whom the etiology was bacteriologically investigated [60] (BII). Therefore, it must be considered that, even when resistant bacteria are etiologically involved, the administration of an appropriate antimicrobial drug that covers them does not always improve the prognosis.-TAZ/PIPC, intravenous drip, 4.5 g/3\u20134 times a day-IPM/CS, intravenous drip, 0.5 g/4 times a day or 1 g/3 times a day-MEPM, intravenous drip, 1 g/3 times a day-DRPM, intravenous drip, 0.5\u20131 g/3 times a day-BIPM, intravenous drip, 0.3\u20130.6 g/3\u20134 times a dayOne of the following options should be combined with one of the above regimens:\u2666First choices-CPFX, intravenous drip, 300 mg/twice a day-LVFX, intravenous drip, 500 mg/once a day-PZFX, intravenous drip, 500 to 1000 mg/twice a day\n<>Second choices-AMK, intravenous drip, 15 mg/kg/once a day-GM, intravenous drip, 5 mg/kg/once a day-TOB, intravenous drip, 5 mg/kg/once a day\n\n\n\n",

As bacteria isolated from the lower airways of inpatients are common colonizers in many cases, Gram staining is also useful for discerning colonization from infection by evaluating the presence or absence of neutrophil and phagocytosis. Therefore, it is desirable to combine bacterial culture with Gram staining [51], [61], [62], [63], [64], [65].",

Furthermore, there are many opportunities to undergo antimicrobial drug therapy that affects the indigenous microflora. For such reasons, gram-negative bacillus (enteric bacteria or P. aeruginosa) frequently colonize within the oropharyngeal region of the elderly patients or long-term bed-bound patients, many of whom need airway suctioning or have tracheostomy that may serve as portal of entry of environmental pathogen. Oropharyngeal microflora primarily consisting of these gram-negative bacteria can be aspirated into the airway after surgery requiring sedation or anesthesia, or during or after endoscopic examination [57], [72], [73]. Briefly, anaerobes may be an occasional pathoen in polymicrobial infection as seen on Gram staining of patients with suspected aspiration pneumonia, but S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, S. aureus, Klebsiella spp., P. aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter spp. are more commonly involved in many cases, being similar to the microorganisms that are thought to be the major pathogen of hospital-acquired pneumonia. This is in contrast with the community-onset aspiration pneumonia, represented by lung abscess, in that anaerobes are primarily involved [67], [71].",

            "text": "In the treatment of hospital-acquired pneumonia, the duration of antimicrobial therapy generally tends to be longer than required for the following reasons: opacity on chest X-ray often remains for reasons other than pneumonia even after the start of antimicrobial drug treatment; and there may be a large number of latent non-pneumonia (or non-infectious-disease) factors that may cause increase in body temperature or CRP level in inpatients [75]. However, if appropriate antimicrobial drug treatment is performed, it is possible to complete treatment in 1 week [57]. In strains such as Enterobacter spp., Serratia spp., Citrobacter spp., and Morganella spp. (Table 5 GNRb), the expression of intrinsic antimicrobial-drug-resistance genes encoded in chromosome genes is induced during antimicrobial drug treatment, a phenomenon which is basically rarely seen in E. coli, Klebsiella spp., H. influenzae, and M. catarrhalis (Table 5 GNRa) (Table 5) [74], [76], [77]. Therefore, if adequately chosen treatment parameters are improved, antimicrobial treatment could be completed with careful follow up of patients' condition. Although it is useful to recognize these pathogens, abbreviated as SPACE (Serratia, Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter, Citrobacter, and Enterobacter), as a representative microorganism group that causes hospital-acquired pneumonia, the SPACE group is essentially a common colonizer. Therefore it is important to bear in mind that antimicrobial drug is not always indicated upon the isolation of SPACE to avoid selection of antimicrobial resistant bacteria related to unnecessary or long-term antimicrobial therapy [65], [67].b.Gram-positive bacteria- - - Executive summary- - --In MRSA-infected patients, glycopeptides (VCM, TEIC) or LZD should be selected [78], [79] (AI).The therapeutic efficacy of LZD is similar to those of glycopeptides [50], [80].The penetration of LZD into the alveolar epithelium-lining fluid and intra-alveolar sputum is more favorable. Therefore, use of LZD should be encouraged in cases of restricted sputum expectoration, such as VAP [51] (BII).Exclusive use of a single drug may accelerate the acquisition of resistance to the agent [81], [82], [83] (CI).As DAP is inactivated by pulmonary surfactants, its use should be avoided for MRSA pneumonia.\n-Glycopeptides should be selected as first-line drug for pneumonia caused by Corynebacterium sp [84] (AII).- - - Explanation- - -There is no significant difference in the therapeutic efficacy for MRSA pneumonia between glycopeptides and LZD. Several studies reported that the overall clinical efficacy of LZD, including the incidence of side effects, was superior to VCM in patients with hospital-acquired pneumonia caused by MRSA [85], [86]. However, since the dosing of VCM in these studies have been considered suboptimal, further study is needed [51], [87]. Some investigators have recommended that, when MRSA is susceptible to CLDM or MINO on a susceptibility test, LZD, a protein synthesis inhibitor should be administered given the possible involvement of the Panton-Valentine leukocidin [78], [88]. If a prompt improvement is achieved by the intravenous drip of LZD 600 mg q12h, or if the patient's condition is not critical, switch from the intravenous administration to an oral preparation of LZD, which shows high bioavailability [89], is encouraged. As DAP is inactivated by pulmonary surfactants, it should not be used to treat MRSA pneumonia. This may not apply to the treatment of septic pulmonary embolism [90].- - - Drugs to be recommended- - -(1)MRSA\u2666First choices-VCM, intravenous drip, 1 g/twice a day-TEIC, intravenous drip, 400 mg for the first 2 days/twice a day for loading, 400 mg/once a day from Day 3\u2217TDM should be conducted so that the trough levels of VCM and TEIC range from 15 to 20 \u03bcg/mL [11].-LZD, intravenous drip or oral administration, 600 mg/twice a day\n<>Second choices-ABK, intravenous drip, 300 mg/once a day (A trough level was established as \u22642 \u03bcg/mL using TDM.)-ST combination drug (SMX at 400 mg/TMP at 80 mg), oral administration, 2 tablets/twice a day or intravenous drip, 960 mg/twice a day-CLDM, intravenous drip, 600 mg/2\u20134 times a day (The results of drug susceptibility testing must be confirmed).\n\n(2)MSSARefer to the section \u201c2.1 Community-acquired pneumonia- - - 2.1.2 Definitive therapy- - - [12] MSSA (2) Hospital treatment\u201d (p. 8).(3)\nS. pneumoniae\nRefer to the section \u201c2.1 Community-acquired pneumonia- - - 2.1.2 Definitive therapy- - - [1] S. pneumoniae (PC-susceptible) and [2] S. pneumoniae (PC-resistant)\u201d (p.6).(4)\nCorynebacterium sp.VCM and TEIC should be administered, as described for MRSA.\nc.Gram-negative bacteria- - - Drugs to be recommended- - -(1)\nE. coli, Klebsiella spp., Proteus spp. (non-ESBL-producing bacteria)Refer to the section \u201c2.1 Community-acquired pneumonia- - - 2.1.2 Definitive therapy- - - [7] Klebsiella spp. [non-extended-spectrum \u03b2-lactamase (ESBL)-producing bacteria] (2) Hospital treatment \u201d (p.7).(2)\nE. coli, Klebsiella spp., Proteus mirabilis (ESBL-producing bacteria)Refer to the section \u201c2.1 Community-acquired pneumonia- - - 2.1.2 Definitive therapy- - - [8] Klebsiella spp. [ESBL-producing bacteria] (2) Hospital treatment\u201d (p. 7).(3)\nEnterobacter spp., Serratia spp., Citrobacter spp., Morganella spp., Proteus vulgaris\n\u2666Third-generation cephems or quinolones should be administered [50], [51], [68] (AII).-CTRX, intravenous drip, 2 g/once a day or 1 g/twice a day-CTX, intravenous drip, 1\u20132 g/2\u20133 times a day-LVFX, intravenous drip, 500 mg/once a day-CPFX, intravenous drip, 300 mg/twice a day-PZFX, intravenous drip, 1000 mg/twice a day\n<>If a strain is estimated to constantly express cephalosporinase (highly resistant to \u03b2-lactamase inhibitor-containing \u03b2-lactams, oxyimino [=3rd generation] cephalosporin and cephamycin, through plasmid genes) on an antimicrobial drug susceptibility test, fourth-generation cephems or carbapenems should be administered.-CFPM, intravenous drip, 1\u20132 g/4 times a day-CZOP, intravenous drip, 1\u20132 g/4 times a day-MEPM, intravenous drip, 1 g/3 times a day-DRPM, intravenous drip, 0.5\u20131 g/3 times a day\n\n(4)\nP. aeruginosa\n\u2022Anti-pseudomonal penicillins, third-generation or later cephems, carbapenems, or new quinolones should be administered [50], [51] (AII).\u2022No marked enhancement of therapeutic effects related to combination therapy with a \u03b2-lactam and aminoglycoside has been confirmed.\u2022Combination therapy with a \u03b2-lactam and new quinolone (CPFX, LVFX) may be effective, but its effects have not been investigated.\u2022When P. aeruginosa is resistant to several antimicrobial drugs, combination therapy should be aggressively performed [90], [91] (AII).\u2022When performing combination therapy, the combination effects of the drugs should be measured in vitro [50] (BIII).-PIPC, intravenous drip, 2\u20134 g/4 times a day-TAZ/PIPC, intravenous drip, 4.5 g/4 times a day-CAZ, intravenous drip, 1\u20132 g/4 times a day-CFPM, intravenous drip, 1\u20132 g/4 times a day-CZOP, intravenous drip, 1\u20132 g/4 times a day-AZT, intravenous drip, 1\u20132 g/4 times a day-MEPM, intravenous drip, 1 g/3 times a day-DRPM, intravenous drip, 0.5\u20131 g/3 times a day-TOB, intravenous drip, 5 mg/kg/once a day-CPFX, intravenous drip, 300 mg/twice a day-PZFX, intravenous drip, 1000 mg/twice a day-LVFX, intravenous drip, 500 mg/once a day-BIPM, intravenous drip, 0.3\u20130.6 g/3\u20134 times a day\u2217Combination therapy\n the above \u03b2-lactam + TOB (intravenous drip, 5 mg/kg/once a day)\n or + CPFX (intravenous drip, 300 mg/twice a day)\n or + PZFX (intravenous drip, 1000 mg/twice a day)\u2217Multi-drug-resistant bacteria\n CL (colistin): An initial dose (loading, 5 mg/kg) of CL should be administered as a single dose.

In addition, the number of extended spectrum of \u03b2-lactamase (ESBL)-producing strains of E. coli, Klebsiella, and Proteus sp. that are resistant to all cephalosporin has increased. Among resistant GNRs, such as Enterobacter spp., strains that constantly produce AmpC-type \u03b2-lactamase (cephalosporinase) (plasmid type) must also be considered [76], [77].Concerning non-fermentative bacteria, their intrinsic susceptibility to antimicrobial agents differs among P. aeruginosa, Stenotrophomonas spp., and Acinetobacter spp. A study indicated that, in patients with P. aeruginosa pneumonia, monotherapy with a new quinolone might show unfavorable bacteria-eradicating effects or lead to recrudescence [90]. In some patients, combination therapy with a \u03b2-lactam (PIPC, CAZ, CFPM, or carbapenems), which has an anti-pseudomonal activity, and aminoglycoside or new quinolone may be considered [51], [90], [94]. Most strains of Stenotrophomonas spp. are susceptible to MINO or an ST combination drug.\nM. catarrhalis and Acinetobacter spp. are the frequent types of Gram-negative coccus detected in patients with early and late hospital-acquired pneumonia, respectively. Many strains of the former produce \u03b2-lactamase. The latter is a GNR existing in the hospital environment, and may be resistant to many antimicrobial drugs. However, in Japan, the multi-drug resistance of this type of bacteria has not widely distributed. Carbapenems and new quinolones should be selected. However, the vast majority of Acinetobaccter strains are susceptible to SBT/ABPC. In particular, SBT has an antimicrobial activity against this type of bacteria, and their susceptibility to SBT/ABPC should routinely be confirmed. Primary test drugs for an antimicrobial susceptibility of this type of bacteria (drugs appropriate for a routine examination panel) are SBT/ABPC, CAZ, IPM/CS, MEPM, GM, TOB, LVFX, and CPFX [95].Pan-sensitive strains of H. influenzae are \u03b2-lactamase (BL)-negative, ABPC-sensitive (BLNAS) strains. However, there are various resistance patterns: BL-producing, ABPC-resistant (BLPAR), BL-negative, ABPC-resistant (BLNAR), and BL-producing, AMPC/CVA-resistant (BLPACR) strains. BLNAS strains can be treated with ABPC, but SBT/ABPC therapy is required to control BLPAR strains. The administration of CTRX or new quinolones is necessary for BLNAR or BLPACR.A randomized-controlled trial with multivariate analysis has shown that factors for favorable bacteriological effects included the absence of P. aeruginosa-related pneumonia (<0.01), a higher body weight (<0.01), a low APACHE II score (severity) (0.03), and CPFX therapy (0.04) [90]. Conditions suggesting the use of new quinolones include allergy to \u03b2-lactams, the presence of or concern for nephropathy (an aminoglycoside cannot be combined with a \u03b2-lactam), necessity of covering obligate intracellular pathogen, or situations in which switching to an oral preparation is indicated [94]. An in vitro study indicated that the alveolar epithelial lining fluid (ELF) concentration of LVFX reached as high as its serum concentration. Furthermore, a prospective open-label study reported that switching of intravenous drip to oral administration decreased the ELF concentration, but it was within the range at which many pathogens are deemed sensitive based on the cumulative data of minimum inhibitory concentrations for causative microorganisms [94].\n\n",

However, NHCAP may be primarily regarded as being similar to geriatric pneumonia [97], [98]. There is no fact that the rate at which resistant bacteria are isolated increases with severity [97]. Even when pneumonia is not severe, the host's activities of daily living (ADL) and an underlying disease/immunodeficiency reduce the prognosis in many cases [98]. As this type of pneumonia develops in a variety of uneven populations, it is difficult to simply determine severity classification. Therefore, considering various conditions, the entity of \u201ctreatment category\u201d, involving the ethical aspects of geriatric care, was introduced based on evaluation by the attending physician who knows the patient well (Fig. 1). Frequent basic conditions or concomitant diseases for NHCAP in Japan include an advanced age, central nervous diseases, aspiration, a reduction in ADL, and tubal feeding. Their factors are aspiration pneumonia itself or risk factors, and HCAP in Japan may overlap with aspiration pneumonia [99]. On the other hand, in NHCAP patients, MRSA, P. aeruginosa, and anaerobes are more frequently isolated in comparison with CAP patients. It is necessary to switch therapeutic strategies, considering these causative microorganisms. Refer to the next section \u201c2.4 Aspiration pneumonia\u201d (p.19).",

Concerning causative microorganisms, a study reported that there was no marked difference between NHCAP and CAP [100]. On the other hand, a study in the United States indicated that S. aureus was frequently detected [101], and another study in Italy, where the rapid aging of society is advanced, as described for Japan, reported that aspiration pneumonia, H. influenzae, S. aureus, and Gram-negative bacillus were more frequent than in patients with CAP [59]. As a result, the rate of resistant bacteria increased, and inappropriate antimicrobial drugs were selected in a high proportion of patients. In addition, the mortality rate was higher than in CAP patients, suggesting the association between the two factors.",

A study reported that, even among severe NHCAP patients who were managed with a ventilator or in the ICU, resistant bacteria were not isolated in those who had made favorable daily life activities without a history of antimicrobial drug therapy [103]. Another study indicated that tubal feeding was an independent risk factor for infection with P. aeruginosa (odds ratio: 13.9) [104] (II). This is the reason why Treatment Category C was established in the Guidelines. Briefly, patients who do not meet the above two items are regarded as having no risk factor for resistant bacteria, and assigned to Group B. Patients meeting 1 or 2 items or those in whom MRSA was previously isolated are assigned to Group C. Respective drugs to be recommended were separately established. Patients in whom outpatient treatment is considered to be appropriate are assigned to Group A, and those in whom the attending physician considers ventilator or ICU management necessary to Group D. Drugs to be recommended were added, and a treatment category algorithm (Fig. 1) [96] was prepared.

            "text": "- - - Drugs to be recommended- - -a.Empiric therapy (Fig. 1) [96]\n(1)Cases in which there is no risk of resistant bacteria and outpatient treatment is performed (Group A)According to a study, Chlamydophila spp. and M. pneumoniae accounted for 34.7 and 9.3% of patients in whom the type of microorganisms that cause NHCAP was clarified in Japan, respectively [98]. The results suggested that Chlamydophila spp. is a target of treatment, as described for CAP. Therefore, in Group A, combination therapy with a \u03b2-lactam and macrolide or monotherapy with a respiratory quinolone should be performed (BII). In Group D, an anti-P. aeruginosa drug should be combined with CPFX, PZFX, or AZM for injection, considering Legionella or Chlamydophila spp. pneumonia. However, concerning combination therapy with a macrolide (CII) in patients without \u201csevere pneumonia requiring intensive care\u201d, as described below, the evidence level is not always high from the perspectives of medical economics, side effects, and resistant bacteria [106]. Some studies examined the mortality rate with respect to the presence or absence of treatment covering atypical pathogens, and reported that the mortality rate was significantly lower in the presence of such treatment [17]. A recent meta-analysis also showed a difference [107].Respiratory quinolones were established as an option (BII) based on many references describing that their effects are similar to or more potent than those of combination therapy with a \u03b2-lactam and macrolide. However, this must be further examined, considering factors such as severity and the presence or absence of concomitant sepsis [108]. Furthermore, the prevalence of penicillin-resistant Pneumococcus, which has been internationally emphasized as an issue, and macrolide-resistant Pneumococcus, which has been markedly observed in Japan, was also a background factor for establishing respiratory quinolones as an option [109]. The previous use of antimicrobial drugs, which is often observed in patients with NHCAP, is considered to be a risk factor for resistant Pneumococcus\n[110]. A study reported that penicillin or EM resistance in HCAP patients was more advanced than in CAP patients [100]. A study indicated that the efficacy of oral therapy with LVFX was similar to that of CTRX injection therapy in 619 patients with CAP [111]. Another study reported that, among 680 patients with non-severe HCAP, oral LVFX was useful in those with no description of causative microorganisms [112]. However, when aspiration pneumonia is suspected, GRNX or MFLX should be selected, because the effects of LVFX on anaerobes are weak. Furthermore, several studies suggested the usefulness of MFLX, which is not influenced by the kidney function and does not require dose regulation, in elderly patients with NHCAP [113], [114].As treatment is completed with a single, high dose, compliance is favorable. AZM sustained-release preparations [115], [116], [117], which simultaneously cover bacteria and atypical pathogens, and STFX, which shows a favorable MIC for anaerobes, may also be recommended [118].\u2666First choices-CVA/AMPC, oral (125/250 mg), 2 tablets/3\u20134 times a day-SBTPC, oral (375 mg), 2 tablets/3\u20134 times a day\n+one of the followings:-AZM sustained-release preparation, oral, 2 g/single dose-CAM, oral, 200 mg/twice a day\n<>Second choices-MFLX, oral, 400 mg/once a day-GRNX, oral, 400 mg/once a day-STFX, oral, 100 mg/L to 2 times a day\n \n or-CTRX\u22171, intravenous drip, 2 g/once a day or 1 g/twice a day-CTX\u22171, intravenous drip, 1\u20132 g/2\u20133 times a day\n+one of the followings:-AZM sustained-release preparation, oral, 2 g/single dose-CAM, oral, 200 mg/twice a day\n\n\n *1) As the antimicrobial activity of the drug against anaerobes is insufficient, it is inappropriate under a tentative diagnosis of aspiration pneumonia.(2)Cases in which there is no risk of resistant bacteria and hospital treatment is performed (Group B)In this category, we recommend monotherapy from the perspectives of causative microorganisms resembling those for CAP and side effect-based \u201cinnocent properties\u201d. A study reported that initial treatment with narrow-spectrum antimicrobial drugs did not always lead to a poor prognosis [119]. In particular, according to two articles [120], [121], it is not necessary to consider resistant bacteria in HCAP patients in whom causative microorganisms are unclear; treatment in accordance with CAP treatment is sufficient (BII). However, an advanced age, central nervous diseases, aspiration, and a reduction in ADL are the clinical characteristics of aspiration pneumonia. The condition of NHCAP in Japan overlaps with aspiration pneumonia [122]. Therefore, in Group B, to which patients admitted for the first time, with no recent use of antimicrobial drugs, correspond, antimicrobial therapy with \u03b2-lactamase inhibitor-containing penicillins is appropriate, as described for CAP. However, when aspiration pneumonia is suspected, CTRX and LVFX should be avoided (BIV). For the management of enteric bacteria, candidate drugs for Group B, PAPM/BP, may be selected. Actually, it is not necessary to consider P. aeruginosa in patients with CAP or non-ICU HAP. A study indicated that ertapenem, which is not effective for P. aeruginosa, was useful [123], as demonstrated for PAPM/BP. However, another study reported that the widespread use of ertapenem induced the cross resistance of P. aeruginosa to other carbapenems; the use of PAPM/BP alone should be avoided [124] (BIV). In elderly persons, with a high risk of aspiration, who are repeatedly admitted and discharged, Klebsiella is often involved. TAZ/PIPC is more useful according to a study [125] (BII). In patients in whom Gram-negative bacillus is detected on Gram staining of sputum or those in whom the involvement of enteric bacteria is suspected, PAPM/BP or TAZ/PIPC should be selected (BIV).-SBT/ABPC, intravenous drip, 3 g/3\u20134 times a day-CTRX\u22171, intravenous drip, 2 g/once a day or 1 g/twice a day-CTX\u22171, intravenous drip, 1\u20132 g/2\u20133 times a day-LVFX\u22171, intravenous drip, 500 mg/once a day-PAPM/BP, intravenous drip, 0.5\u20131 g/2\u20134 times a day\n*1) As the antimicrobial activity of the drug against anaerobes is insufficient, it is inappropriate under a tentative diagnosis of aspiration pneumonia.(3)Cases in which there is a risk of resistant bacteria and hospital treatment is performed (Group C)The target microorganisms include P. aeruginosa, MRSA, and Acinetobacter spp. in addition to frequent microorganisms that cause respiratory infection [97], [99], [103], [126]. As antimicrobial drugs, TAZ/PIPC, with an antimicrobial activity against P. aeruginosa, fourth-generation cephems, carbapenems, and quinolones (CPFX, PZFX) are recommended. TAZ/PIPC exhibits effects similar to those of IPM/CS and MEPM in patients with nursing and healthcare-associated pneumonia [127] (BII). PZFX also has an antimicrobial activity against S. pneumoniae when used at a high dose (2 g/day). When pneumonia related to atypical pathogens such as Chlamydophila spp. is suggested, quinolones should be selected. As the antimicrobial activities of fourth-generation cephems and quinolones against anaerobes are weak, these drugs should be combined with MNZ, CLDM, or SBT/ABPC. Recently, the resistance of the Bacteroides fragilis group to CLDM has advanced [128]. Therefore, in Europe and the United States, MNZ is selected as a first-choice antimicrobial drug against anaerobes. However, the rate at which the B. fragilis group is involved in oral anaerobes is low, and combination therapy with CLDM may be selected [129], [130]. Therefore, for combination therapy with fourth-generation cephems, we recommend the two drugs. When there is a risk of MRSA, such as previous admission, they should be combined with VCM, TEIC, or LZD. If there is no abscess formation, ABK is also effective.\u2666First choices-TAZ/PIPC, intravenous drip, 4.5 g/3\u20134 times a day-IPM/CS, intravenous drip, 0.5\u20131 g/2\u20134 times a day-MEPM, intravenous drip, 1 g/2\u20133 times a day-DRPM, intravenous drip, 0.5\u20131 g/3 times a day\n<>Second choices-CFPM*2, intravenous drip, 1\u20132 g/2\u20134 times a day-CPR\u22172, intravenous drip, 1\u20132 g/2\u20134 times a day\n+one of the followings:-CLDM, intravenous drip, 600 mg/2\u20134 times a day-MNZ, intravenous drip, 500 mg/4 times a day\n \n or-CPFX\u22172, intravenous drip, 300 mg/twice a day-PZFX\u22172, intravenous drip, 1000 mg/twice a day\n+one of the followings:-CLDM, intravenous drip, 600 mg/2\u20134 times a day-SBT/ABPC, intravenous drip, 3 g/3\u20134 times a day\n\n*In addition to the above drugs, if MRSA infection is suspected, antimicrobial drugs should be added in accordance with the section \u201cMRSA pneumonia\u201d.*2) As the antimicrobial activity of the drug against anaerobes is insufficient, it should be combined with a drug with an antimicrobial activity against anaerobes (MNZ, CLDM, or SBT/ABPC) under a tentative diagnosis of aspiration pneumonia.(4)Severe cases requiring intensive care (Group D)To cover L. pneumophila and atypical pathogens, which are rare as causative microorganisms but may cause severe conditions, Group-C antimicrobial drugs should be combined with CPFX, PZFX, or AZM injection (BI). Concerning the usefulness of combination therapy with a \u03b2-lactam and macrolide injection for severe pneumonia, evidence has been accumulated [131]. A study indicated that, in severe community-acquired pneumonia patients with sepsis or requiring ICU management, combination therapy with a \u03b2-lactam and macrolide led to a more favorable prognosis compared to that with a quinolone (I), suggesting that anti-inflammatory actions are involved in the mechanism [132]. In addition, another study reported that, among pneumonia patients with acute pulmonary disorder, both the ventilator withdrawal and survival rates in a macrolide-treated group were higher than in a non-macrolide-treated group [19] (I). Several meta-analyses also support them [107], [133].\u2666First choices-TAZ/PIPC, intravenous drip, 4.5 g/3\u20134 times a day-IPM/CS, intravenous drip, 0.5\u20131 g/2\u20134 times a day-MEPM, intravenous drip, 1 g/2\u20133 times a day-DRPM, intravenous drip, 0.5\u20131 g/3 times a day\n+one of the followings:-CPFX\u22172, intravenous drip, 300 mg/twice a day-PZFX\u22172, intravenous drip, 1000 mg/twice a day-AZM, intravenous drip, 500 mg/once a day\n<>Second choices-CFPM\u22172, intravenous drip, 1\u20132 g/2\u20134 times a day-CPR\u22172, intravenous drip, 1\u20132 g/2\u20134 times a day\n+one of the followings:-CLDM, intravenous drip, 600 mg/2\u20134 times a day-MNZ, intravenous drip, 500 mg/4 times a day\n+one of the followings:-CPFX\u22172, intravenous drip, 300 mg/twice a day-PZFX\u22172, intravenous drip, 1000 mg/twice a day-AZM, intravenous drip, 500 mg/once a day\n\nIn addition to the above drugs,*If MRSA infection is suspected, antimicrobial drugs should be added in accordance with the section \u201cMRSA pneumonia\u201d.*2) As the antimicrobial activity of the drug against anaerobes is insufficient, it should be combined with a drug with an antimicrobial activity against anaerobes (MNZ, CLDM, or SBT/ABPC) under a tentative diagnosis of aspiration pneumonia.b.Definitive therapyAntimicrobial drugs against identified causative microorganisms should be selected in accordance with the section \u201c2.2 Hospital-acquired pneumonia\u201d (p. 8).\n\n",

The guidelines present conditions that may cause dysphagia, which were proposed by the Japanese Study Group on Aspiration Pulmonary Disease (Table 9\n, modified) [136].

In elderly persons admitted to long-term care beds or nursing homes, risk factors include dysphagia and tubal feeding according to international data on pneumonia that develops in nursing homes [137], [138], [139]. In Japan, frequent underlying diseases in patients with NHCAP also include central nervous diseases and dementia, which are closely associated with aspiration. The proportion of patients after percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) is high [140]. However, among various types of community-acquired pneumonia, a diagnosis of aspiration pneumonia is made based on onset factor-based classification, and is not equal to NHCAP diagnosed primarily based on the place of onset or grade of nursing. According to data in Spain, aspiration pneumonia accounts for 20.6% of patients with healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP) requiring admission. This percentage was markedly higher than in those with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) requiring admission (3.6%), but corresponded to no more than 1/5 [100]. On the other hand, a multicenter cooperative study involving inpatients with pneumonia in Japan, where the rapid aging of society is advanced, reported that 60.1% of patients who were admitted with CAP had aspiration pneumonia. Even in patients with CAP, which is not classified as NHCAP, the involvement of aspiration cannot be ignored [141]. Furthermore, the study indicated the involvement of aspiration in 86.7% of patients, aged over 70 years, with CAP/HAP [141]. In the future, the significance of distinguishing aspiration pneumonia among patients with NHCAP or HAP and changing therapeutic strategies should be examined. However, NHCAP more markedly affects ADL compared to CAP, and the aspect of elderly pneumonia is emphasized; it may be significant to positively diagnose aspiration pneumonia and establish therapeutic strategies different from those for CAP [142].",

However, no article has provided high-level evidence regarding aspiration pneumonia. As the following drugs affect the intestinal flora, antimicrobial drug-associated diarrhea may occur. If symptom improvement is delayed, patients must be promptly admitted, and drip infusion therapy should be performed (outpatient treatment should not be prolonged).(1)Outpatient treatment\u2666First choices\n - CVA/AMPC, oral (125/250 mg), 2 tablets/3\u20134 times a day\n - SBTPC, oral (375 mg), 2 tablets/3\u20134 times a day<>Second choices\n - MFLX, oral, 400 mg/once a day\n - STFX, oral, 100 mg/1\u20132 times a day\n - GRNX, oral, 400 mg/once a day\n(2)Hospital treatmentWhen a diagnosis of aspiration pneumonia is made, SBT/ABPC is most frequently used in Japan [151]. Kaneko et al. reported that the sensitivity of oral anaerobes that may cause aspiration pneumonia, such as Peptostreptococcus spp., Prevotella spp., and Fusobacterium spp., to SBT/ABPC was 100%, similar to that to TAZ/PIPC [152].The effects of CLDM on aspiration pneumonia or a pulmonary abscess are similar to those of SBT/ABPC (BI) [145]. SBT/ABPC and CLDM showed similar effects and tolerance on aspiration pneumonia (67.5 and 63.5%, respectively) [147]. Oral anaerobes, excluding Bacteroides spp., are still susceptible to CLDM. A randomized clinical trial (RCT) indicated that CLDM was more potent than cephems [153].\u2666First choice\n - SBT/ABPC, intravenous drip, 3 g/3\u20134 times a day<>Second choice\n - CLDM, intravenous drip, 600 mg/2\u20134 times a day\n\n\u2781Cases in which there is a risk of resistant bacteria or severe casesIn cases in which there is a risk of resistant bacteria or severe cases, drugs should be selected in accordance with options for Group C for NHCAP. Tubal feeding is a risk factor for aspiration, and is also a risk factor for resistant bacteria [97]. When the involvement of Enterobacteriacae, such as K. pneumoniae and E. coli, is suggested, empiric therapy should be selected in accordance with cases in which there is a risk of resistant bacteria [55]. In Japan, the proportion of ESBL-producing bacteria on sputum culture in patients with respiratory infectious diseases is 5% or less [13], but the number of ESBL-producing bacteria has slightly increased; this must be considered in the future [154], [155]. A study reported that the clinical effects of TAZ/PIPC on non-ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae were more potent than those of SBT/ABPC; caution is needed [125]. It must be considered that, in cases of aspiration pneumonia classified as HCAP, Enterobacteriacae is isolated at a frequency that cannot be ignored. Concerning aspiration pneumonia that occurs in hospitals, some reviews proposed that antimicrobial drugs should be selected, regarding the condition as hospital-acquired pneumonia; empiric therapy may be selected in accordance with the Guidelines for the Management of Hospital-acquired Pneumonia, which were published by the Japanese Respiratory Society [156], [157]. According to a study, BIPM, which does not cause kidney dysfunction in elderly patients, is also effective (CIV); therefore, it is presented as an option for cases in which there is a risk of resistant bacteria [158].The mortality rate in patients with VAP is high. If causative microorganisms cannot be initially covered, the mortality rate may increase [51]. Therefore, drugs should be selected, regarding the condition as severe aspiration pneumonia. Three studies reported that, in a group in which TAZ/PIPC was selected as a drug to be combined with aminoglycosides for VAP treatment, the mortality rate was lower than in a group in which CAZ was selected [159], [160], [161]. In particular, when pneumonia was caused by P. aeruginosa, the clinical effects of TAZ/PIPC were more potent than those of IPM/CS (BII). For monotherapy, information on the culture of protected specimen brush (PSB) samples or broncho-alveolar lavage (BAL) fluid is strongly recommended [70], [162]. On the other hand, an observational study indicated that three-drug therapy (two anti-P. aeruginosa drugs + an anti-MRSA drug) deteriorated the prognosis; an RCT should be conducted in the future [60]. Therefore, if there is a risk of resistant bacteria, at least broad-spectrum antimicrobial drugs must be used for empiric therapy. However, assuming causative microorganisms with reference to Gram staining reactions, minimum necessary antimicrobial drugs should be selected based on local factors (antimicrobial drug susceptibility pattern of each type of bacteria in each hospital). Recently, the entity of ventilator-associated tracheobronchitis (VAT) was proposed, and the disadvantages of aggressive treatment have been discussed [163]. In a multicenter cooperative study, patients with VAT, which occurred in the ICU, were divided into two groups with and without antimicrobial drug therapy, and the results were compared. In the former, the incidence of VAP was significantly lower, and the mechanical ventilation-free period was significantly longer. In addition, the ICU mortality rate was significantly lower. On the other hand, there was no significant difference in the appearance of resistant bacteria between the two groups [164].\u2666First choices-TAZ/PIPC, intravenous drip, 4.5 g/3\u20134 times a day-IPM/CS, intravenous drip, 0.5\u20131 g/2\u20134 times a day-MEPM, intravenous drip, 1 g/2\u20133 times a day-DRPM, intravenous drip, 0.5\u20131 g/3 times a day-BIPM, intravenous drip, 0.3\u20130.6 g/3\u20134 times a day\n<>Second choices-CFPM, intravenous drip, 1\u20132 g/2\u20134 times a day-CPR, intravenous drip, 1\u20132 g/2\u20134 times a day\n+one of the followings:-CLDM, intravenous drip, 600 mg/2\u20134 times a day-MNZ, intravenous drip, 500 mg/4 times a day\n \n or-LVFX, intravenous drip, 500 mg/once a day-CPFX, intravenous drip, 300 mg/twice a day-PZFX, intravenous drip, 500 to 1000 mg/twice a day\n+one of the followings:-CLDM, intravenous drip, 600 mg/2\u20134 times a day-MNZ, intravenous drip, 500 mg/4 times a day-SBT/ABPC, intravenous drip, 1.5\u20133 g/3\u20134 times a day\n\n\n*If MRSA infection is suspected, antimicrobial drugs should be administered in accordance with the section \u201cMRSA pneumonia\u201d in addition to the above drugs.[Administration period of antimicrobial drugs]It is recommended that the treatment period of hospital-acquired pneumonia should be 7\u201310 days. However, the treatment period should be 14 days in patients with pneumonia related to non-glucose-fermenting bacteria such as P. aeruginosa\n[2] (BII). Concerning VAP, a study reported that there was no difference in the clinical effects between 8 and 15 days [57].b.Definitive therapyTo control identified causative microorganisms, antimicrobial drugs should be selected in accordance with the section \u201cHospital-acquired pneumonia\u201d.

Symptoms such as fever that does not respond to broad-spectrum antimicrobial drugs, cough, dyspnea, sputum, and bloody sputum/hemoptysis are observed.-Laboratory findings: Chest X-ray shows an infiltrative shadow (typically, a wedge shadow involving the pleura as the base). On thoracic CT, infiltrative and nodular shadows (with a halo sign in some cases) are observed. In the recovery phase of neutrophils, an air crescent sign is noted. An increase in the inflammatory marker such as the CRP level, Aspergillus galactomannan antigen-positive reactions, and an increase in the (1 \u2192 3)-\u03b2-D-glucan level are useful for diagnosis. However, neither the sensitivity nor specificity is sufficient. The results should be carefully evaluated.-Causative microorganisms: Aspergillus fumigatus is frequently detected, but, recently, an increase in the number of patients with non-fumigatus Aspergillus-related IPA has been indicated.-Specific condition: Lesions are sometimes formed in the nasal sinus and brain; caution is needed.-Early diagnosis: Early treatment is important for successful treatment for this disease.- - - Drugs to be recommended- - -A study reported that, in a group in which VRCZ was used for the initial treatment of IPA, the results of treatment were more favorable than in a group in which d-AMPH was used [166]. Furthermore, another study indicated that therapy with L-AMB at 3 mg/kg/day was safer than that at 10 mg/kg/day, although there was no significant difference in the clinical efficacy [167]. CPFG, MCFG, and ITCZ also have anti-Aspergillus activities, and can be used. It is important to consider different strategies in accordance with the appearance of the host's allergy or adverse events and interactions with drugs used to treat an underlying disease.\u2666First choices-VRCZ, intravenous drip, 6.0 mg/kg/twice a day on Day 1 (loading dose), 3.0\u20134.0 mg/kg/twice a day on Day 2 or later-L-AMB, intravenous drip, 2.5\u20135.0 mg/kg/once a day\n<>Second choices-CPFG, intravenous drip, 70 mg/once a day on Day 1 (loading dose), 50 mg/once a day on Day 2 or later-MCFG, intravenous drip, 150\u2013300 mg/once a day-ITCZ, intravenous drip, 200 mg/twice a day on Days 1 and 2 (loading dose), 200 mg/once a day from Day 3 until Day 14. If treatment is further continued, ITCZ capsules (200 mg) should be administered immediately after meals twice a day, or ITCZ oral solution (20 mL) (200 mg as ITCZ) should be administered after fasting once a day.\n\nb.Chronic progressive pulmonary aspergillosis (CPPA)- - - Executive summary- - --In Japan, various disease types such as aspergilloma with infiltration and enlargement of an existing cavity are included. CPPA includes various diseases such as chronic necrotizing pulmonary aspergillosis (CNPA), chronic cavitary pulmonary aspergillosis (CCPA), and chronic fibrosing pulmonary aspergillosis (CFPA). It refers to a series of syndrome for which the administration of antifungal drugs is essential.-Treatment should be started with injection. If symptoms and findings are stabilized, injection should be switched to oral drugs.-Initial treatment with MCFG or CPFG should be performed [175], [176] (AI).-Initial treatment with ITCZ, VRCZ, or L-AMB can also be selected in accordance with the host's underlying disease or drugs used to treat the underlying disease.-For maintenance therapy, ITCZ and VRCZ oral preparations are recommended (AIII).- - - Explanation- - -[Characteristics of the disease]-Symptoms: This disease develops in hosts with organic diseases such as a cavity or cystic disease of the lung or bronchus. Symptoms such as fever, sputum, bloody sputum/hemoptysis, and dyspnea are observed.-Laboratory findings: Chest X-ray and CT show an infiltrative shadow, enlargement of a cavity, thickening of the cavity wall/pleura, and a niveau in the cavity. There is an increase in the CRP level in many patients. Most patients are positive for anti-Aspergillus precipitating antibody. Neither Aspergillus galactomannan antigen nor \u03b2-D-glucan is a clue to diagnosis.-Causative microorganisms: A. fumigatus is frequently detected. Non-fumigatus Aspergillus-related CPPA is also often observed.- - - Drugs to be recommended- - -A clinical study in Japan indicated that there was no marked difference in the efficacy of treatment between MCFG- and VRCZ-treated groups, whereas MCFG was safer [175]. Another study reported that there was no difference in treatment results between MCFG and CPFG [176]. In the phase of severe symptoms such as fever and bloody sputum, treatment should be started using these injections. Subsequently, if the condition becomes stable, switching to oral preparations can be considered. Currently, there are no criteria for the completion of treatment.(1)Initial treatment\u2666First choices-MCFG, intravenous drip, 150\u2013300 mg/once a day-CPFG, intravenous drip, 70 mg/once a day on Day 1 (loading dose), 50 mg/once a day on Day 2 or later-VRCZ, intravenous drip, 6.0 mg/kg/twice a day on Day 1 (loading dose), 3.0\u20134.0 mg/kg/twice a day on Day 2 or later\n<>Second choices-ITCZ, intravenous drip, 200 mg/twice a day on Days 1 and 2 (loading dose), 200 mg/once a day from Day 3 until Day 14.

When there are no symptoms, follow-up is continued without treatment in some cases.-As a rule, resection should be performed for radical treatment [177].-When treatment is necessary, resection should be considered, if possible, by comprehensively evaluating the age, pulmonary function, and degree of pulmonary destruction/pleural adhesion.-When resection is considered to be impossible, antifungal therapy should be performed if necessary.-Oral treatment with ITCZ or VRCZ is recommended (BIII).- - - Explanation- - -[Characteristics of the disease]-Symptoms: This disease develops in hosts with preexisting cavities such as old pulmonary tuberculosis, pulmonary cysts, and bronchiectasis. The condition is asymptomatic in some patients, whereas symptoms such as sputum and bloody sputum/hemoptysis are observed in others.-Laboratory findings: Chest X-ray and CT show a cavity, intracavitary fungas balls, and thickening of the cavity wall/pleura. Anti-Aspergillus precipitating antibody\u2013positive reactions are obtained. The enhancement of the inflammatory marker is noted in some cases.-Causative microorganisms: A. fumigatus is frequently detected.-Pulmonary aspergilloma is classified into two types: simple and complex aspergilloma based on the grade of difficulty in resection. The former refers to aspergilloma formation in a focus with a thin wall, such as a cyst, without accessory lesions at the periphery. The latter refers to aspergilloma formation in a cavity derived from a strongly destructed existing structure of the lung, such as old pulmonary tuberculosis and bronchiectasis, with marked destructive lesions or pleural adhesion at the periphery of the cavity.- - - Drugs to be recommended- - -Resection should be selected as a first choice. When resection is impossible, medical treatment can be considered.In the treatment of aspergilloma, oral drugs are usually selected. Although there is no evidence, ITCZ capsules/oral solution and VRCZ tablets should be used.-ITCZ capsules, oral, 200 mg/once a day (administered immediately after meals)-ITCZ oral solution, oral, 20 mL (200 mg as ITCZ)/once a day (administered after fasting)-VRCZ tablets\u2022(Body weight: 40 kg or more) oral, 300 mg/twice a day on Day 1 (loading dose), 150 or 200 mg/twice a day (administered between meals) on Day 2 or later\u2022(Body weight: less than 40 kg) oral, 150 mg/twice a day on Day 1 (loading dose), 100 mg/twice a day (administered between meals) on Day 2 or later\n\nd.Primary pulmonary cryptococcosis- - - Executive summary- - --No study has prospectively examined treatment for pulmonary cryptococcosis in patients without underlying diseases.-FLCZ oral preparations should be selected [178] (AII).-ITCZ capsules/oral solution and VRCZ tablets can also be used (BIII).-In severe cases, drugs should be selected in accordance with cases in which underlying diseases are present (BIV).-\nCryptococcus glucuronoxylomannan antigen is useful for the diagnosis of this disease, but cannot be used to evaluate the treatment response or as an index for the completion of treatment.-To confirm the presence or absence of inflammation involving the central nervous system, glucuronoxylomannan antigen or Cryptococcus cells in cerebrospinal fluid should be investigated, even when there is no marked meningeal irritation sign (BIII).-If meningitis is present, initial treatment with an AMPH-B preparation, such as L-AMB, and 5-FC should be performed for 2 weeks or more. Subsequently, treatment should be continued using FLCZ or F-FLCZ.-In Japan, Cryptococcus gattii infection has also been reported. If possible, causative fungus must be isolated/identified.- - - Explanation- - -[Characteristics of the disease]-Symptoms: This disease is often asymptomatic, and is detected on a health checkup in many cases.-Laboratory findings: Chest X-ray and CT show solitary or multiple nodular and infiltrative shadows.-Some cavities are observed in a lot of cases. There is no enhancement of the inflammatory marker in many cases, but glucuronoxylomannan antigen-positive reactions are detected.-Causative microorganisms: This disease is caused by Cryptococcus neoformans. Recently, infection with C. gattii has been reported in Vancouver, Canada and the North area of the West Coast of the United States of America; caution is needed.-\nC. gattii is primarily distributed in the tropical and subtropical zones. Infection in humans has been considered to be rare. However, since 1999, patients infected with C. gattii have been reported in the Pacific Coast of North America. Even healthy adults are infected with C. gattii, and the mortality rate is high.- - - Drugs to be recommended- - -Although there is no evidence regarding pulmonary cryptococcosis, FLCZ tablets, which have a potent activity against Cryptococcus, are frequently selected when the patient's condition is stable in the absence of an underlying disease. Azoles other than this drug can also be selected.\u2666First choice-FLCZ, oral, 400\u2013800 mg/once a day on Days 1 and 2 (loading dose), 200\u2013400 mg/once a day on Day 3 or later\n<>Second choices-ITCZ capsules, oral, 200 mg/once a day (administered immediately after meals)-ITCZ oral solution, oral, 20 mL (200 mg as ITCZ)/once a day (administered after fasting)-VRCZ tablets\u2022(Body weight: 40 kg or more) oral, 300 mg/twice a day on Day 1 (loading dose), 150 or 200 mg/twice a day (administered between meals) on Day 2 or later\u2022(Body weight: less than 40 kg) oral, 150 mg/twice a day on Day 1 (loading dose), 100 mg/twice a day (administered between meals) on Day 2 or later\n\n\ne.Pulmonary cryptococcosis- - - in the presence of an underlying disease (non-HIV infection)- - -- - - Executive summary- - --Initial treatment with F-FLCZ injection should be performed [179] (AIII).-ITCZ and VRCZ injections can also be used (BIII).-In severe cases, treatment with L-AMB + 5-FC should be selected [179] (AIII).-\nCryptococcus antigen is useful for diagnosis, but cannot be used to evaluate the treatment response or as an index for the completion of treatment.-To confirm the presence or absence of inflammation involving the central nervous system, glucuronoxylomannan antigen or Cryptococcus cells in cerebrospinal fluid should be investigated, even when there is no marked meningeal irritation sign (BIII).-If meningitis is present, initial treatment with an AMPH-B preparation, such as L-AMB, and 5-FC should be performed for 2 weeks or more. Subsequently, treatment should be continued using FLCZ or F-FLCZ.- - - Explanation- - -[Characteristics of the disease]-Symptoms: This disease develops as opportunistic infection in hosts with malignant tumors or renal failure, those receiving steroids or immunosuppressive drugs, and patients with AIDS. The symptoms of this disease are more marked than those of primary pulmonary cryptococcosis: fever, general malaise, cough, sputum, bloody sputum, dyspnea, and thoracic pain.-Laboratory findings: Chest X-ray and CT show solitary or multiple nodular and infiltrative shadows. Cavitary lesions are observed in a lot of cases. Cryptococcus glucuronoxylomannan antigen-positive reactions are detected.-Causative microorganisms: This disease is caused by C. neoformans.-Specific condition: If this disease develops in AIDS patients, it may deteriorate to a systemic infectious disease in the early stage, particularly causing meningoencephalitis. Therefore, treatment in accordance with Cryptococcus encephalomeningitis should be performed.- - - Drugs to be recommended- - -Pulmonary cryptococcosis in the host with an underlying disease more frequently leads to a severe condition compared to primary pulmonary cryptococcosis. Although there is no evidence, azoles with anti-Cryptococcus activities should be used for initial treatment. When azoles cannot be used, or when clinical effects are not satisfactory, combination therapy with L-AMB and 5-FC should be considered.\u2666First choices-F-FLCZ, intravenous drip, 800 mg/once a day on Days 1 and 2 (loading dose), 400 mg/once a day on Day 3 or later-ITCZ, intravenous drip, 200 mg/twice a day on Days 1 and 2 (loading dose), 200 mg/once a day from Day 3 until Day 14.

It rapidly exacerbates, showing an unfavorable prognosis. In some patients, autopsy leads to a definitive diagnosis. Fever, dyspnea, and bloody sputum/hemoptysis are often observed.-Laboratory findings: Thoracic CT shows infiltrative/nodular (\u00b1halo sign) shadows and air crescent signs. In some patients, reversed halo signs are observed. Serological diagnosis cannot be applied.-Causative microorganisms: In many cases, this disease is caused by 4 classes of Mucoraceae: Rhizopus, Rhizomucor, Mucor, and Absidia. The most frequent type is Rhizopus oryzae. Recently, an increase in the incidence of infection with Cunninghamella has also been indicated.-Specific condition: Nasal/brain-type, dermal, and disseminated zygomycosis is observed.- - - Drugs to be recommended- - -Currently, only AMPH preparations may be clinically useful for treating zygomycosis among antifungal drugs that are available in clinical practice in Japan. As high-dose therapy must be started as early as possible, not d-AMPH but L-AMB should be selected.-L-AMB, intravenous drip, 5 mg/kg/once a dayPrecautions for the use of antifungal drugs (Confirm the package inserts.)\u2780VRCZVision disorder, liver dysfunction, and neurological/mental adverse events may occur.Combination therapy with RFP, RBT, efavirenz, ritonavir, carbamazepine, long-acting barbiturate, pimozide, quinidine sulfate, ergot alkaloid, or triazolam is contraindicated. This drug is also contraindicated for pregnant women. As a rule, it is contraindicated for patients with a Ccr of <30 mL/min (injection only).As the blood concentration of VRCZ may vary, TDM should be conducted.

This drug is also contraindicated for pregnant women.\n\ng.\nPneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP)- - - Executive summary- - --Initial treatment with an ST combination drug should be performed [182] (AI).-When an ST combination drug cannot be used, treatment with pentamidine or atovaquone should be performed (AI).-To HIV-infected patients with respiratory failure (PaO2: <70 mmHg or A-aDO2: >35 mmHg in room air), corticosteroids should be administered for adjuvant therapy [183] (AI).-Even in the absence of HIV infection, corticosteroids is recommended to patients with respiratory failure (PaO2: <70 mmHg or A-aDO2: >35 mmHg in room air) for adjuvant therapy (AIII).- - - Explanation- - -[Characteristic of the disease]-Symptoms: This disease develops as opportunistic infection in patients taking steroids or immunosuppressive drugs over a long period and those infected with HIV. Three major signs consist of fever, dry cough, and dyspnea. The mode of PCP onset in HIV-infected patients is slower than in non-HIV-infected patients. In the former, fever and hypoxemia are relatively mild, and the mortality rate is low.-Laboratory findings: Typical chest X-ray and CT findings include a diffuse, ground glass opacity extending from the pulmonary hilum to the bilateral sides. On CT, a ground glass opacity expanding like a map is observed in some cases. In addition, various shadows such as multiple nodes/cysts are detected. The levels of CRP, LDH, KL-6, and (1 \u2192 3)-\u03b2-D-glucan increase. A definitive diagnosis is made by confirming Pneumocystis jiroveciil cells using Diff-Quick or Grocott staining of sputum/BALF.- - - Drugs to be recommended- - -ST combination drugs are used as a gold standard of PCP treatment. However, there have been a large number of patients in whom treatment was discontinued due to their side effects. Recently, atovaquone also became available in Japan as a second-choice drug. In patients with mild PCP, atovaquone tablets were as effective as ST combination drugs. In those with moderate PCP, ST combination drugs were more effective, but there was no significant difference due to a small number of subjects. In atovaquone-treated patients, the incidence of adverse events for which administration was discontinued was lower than in ST combination drug-treated patients, suggesting that the tolerance is high [184].\u2666First choicesThe administration period should be 21 days in HIV-infected patients and 14 days in non-HIV-infected patients.

However, when cellular immunodeficiency occurs, this disease develops, leading to a severe condition. It frequently occurs after hematopoietic stem cell/organ transplantation or in patients with AIDS. Symptoms such as fever, general malaise, dry cough, dyspnea, and tachypnea are observed.-Laboratory findings: Chest X-ray and CT show ground glass opacity extending from the pulmonary hilum to the bilateral sides. On CT, a microgranular shadow and thickening of the interlobular septa are sometimes observed. In the initial phase, there is no abnormal shadow on chest X-ray in about one-third of patients; caution is needed. Leukopenia, thrombopenia, atypical lymphocytes, and hypoxemia are noted. A definitive diagnosis is made by verifying inclusion cells, which are called owl's eyes, on histopathological examination. For clinical diagnosis, the antigenemia method is commonly used.-In severely immunosuppressed patients, such as those after transplantation, empiric therapy is sometimes necessary.-Specific condition: This disease causes retinitis, gastroenteritis, hepatitis, or encephalitis in some cases. Other types of opportunistic infection, such as Pneumocystis pneumonia, may concomitantly occur.- - - Antimicrobial drugs to be recommended- - -A first-choice drug for CMV pneumonia treatment is GCV, which has been frequently used. PFA has been used to treat CMV infection in AIDS patients, but experience on its use is limited in patients after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.(1)Initial administration\u2666First choice-GCV, intravenous drip, 5 mg/kg (over 1 h or more)/every 12 h for 2\u20133 weeks + anti-CMV high-titer gamma globulin, intravenous drip, 2.5\u20135 g/once a day for the first 3 days\n<>Second choices-PFA, intravenous drip, 60 mg/kg (over 1 h or more)/3 times a day, every 8 h for 2\u20133 weeks or more + anti-CMV high-titer gamma globulin, intravenous drip, 2.5\u20135 g/once a day for the first 3 days\n or-PFA, intravenous drip, 90 mg/kg (over 2 h or more)/twice a day, every 12 h for 2\u20133 weeks or more + anti-CMV high-titer gamma globulin, intravenous drip, 2.5\u20135 g/once a day for the first 3 days\n\n(2)Maintenance administration\u2666First choices-GCV, intravenous drip, 5 mg/kg (over 1 h or more)/once a day, 7 days a week\n or-GCV, intravenous drip, 6 mg/kg (over 1 h or more)/once a day, 5 days a week\n * This regimen should be completed after confirming the disappearance of clinical symptoms and negative reactions on two consecutive CMV antigenemia tests.\n<>Second choice-PFA, intravenous drip, 90\u2013120 mg/kg (over 2 h or more)/once a day(In clinical practice in Japan, there have been few case reports on once-a-day administration at 120 mg/kg as maintenance therapy.

Most patients with respiratory infectious diseases consult hospitals with fever and cough. The lesion site of the airway is estimated based on symptoms and physical findings (Fig. 3\n) [189]. In addition to thoracic findings, it is necessary to check the presence or absence of dyspnea signs, such as tachypnea, nasal alar breathing, retractive breathing, shoulder breathing, orthopnea, groaning, and cyanosis.

According to the data on investigation of causative microorganisms based on lavage sputum culture in Japan, bacterial and viral pneumonia is frequent in infants/children aged 1 year or younger. In those aged 2\u20136 years, the incidences of bacterial, viral, and atypical pneumonia are similar. In those aged over 6 years, the incidence of atypical pneumonia is the highest [189] (Fig. 4\n). In a similar proportion of children with bacterial pneumonia, non-capsule H. influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae are involved, respectively. Mixed infection with viruses is often observed. In Europe and the United States, lavage sputum culture is not conducted, and data on causative microorganisms are insufficient. However, a review reported similar findings [191] (Table 11\n) [189]. In children, it is not easy to investigate causative microorganisms. In institutions in which it is impossible to investigate causative microorganisms, treatment must be performed based on the statistical frequency of causative microorganisms described below. However, in those in which investigation is possible, the etiology should be investigated if possible.",

Basically, empiric therapy should be performed, considering the severity of pneumonia and causative microorganisms.-The type of causative microorganisms depends on age and severity. Therefore, the necessity of antimicrobial drugs should be examined, and selected, considering age and severity. In addition, bacterial, viral, or atypical pneumonia should be differentiated, and comprehensively evaluated in reference to clinical symptoms, physical findings, laboratory findings, and X-ray findings [189].-Recently, the number of drug-resistant strains of S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis, and M. pneumoniae, which cause pneumonia, has increased [198], [199], [200], [201] (Fig. 6, Fig. 7) [189], [199]. For pneumonia treatment, it is important to perform antimicrobial drug therapy, considering resistant microorganisms.\n-When bacterial pneumonia is suspected, antimicrobial drug therapy that covers S. pneumoniae must be considered, as S. pneumoniae shows the strongest pathogenicity. Concerning treatment for S. pneumoniae pneumonia, resistance criteria have been established, assuming meningitis treatment. However, in January 2008, the Criteria for the Drug Susceptibility of S. pneumoniae, which were prepared by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) (U.S.A.), were revised, and it was recommended that strains, isolated from S. pneumoniae-infected patients other than those with meningitis, with a PCG-MIC or AMPC-MIC of 2 \u03bcg/mL or less should be regarded as susceptible (Fig. 8) [203]. Currently, the susceptibility of S. pneumoniae isolated as causative microorganisms, that is, PCG-MIC, is 2 \u03bcg/mL or less in most strains. Briefly, the drug resistance of S. pneumoniae is not problematic in patients with respiratory infectious diseases. S. pneumoniae infection can be managed with standard-dose synthetic penicillins (AMPC, ABPC).\n-Concerning treatment for H. influenzae pneumonia, strains for which the MIC is evaluated as 1 \u03bcg/mL or less using the microliquid dilution method should be regarded as susceptible, those for which the MIC is 2 \u03bcg/mL as intermediate, and those for which the MIC is 4 \u03bcg/mL or more as resistant according to the Criteria for the ABPC Resistance of H. influenzae, which were prepared by the CLSI.\n",

Concerning hospital treatment, the clinical effects of ABPC intravenous injection for 3\u20134 days until the results of a susceptibility test were clarified were investigated, and approximately 80% of patients responded to this therapy. There was no exacerbation in any patient [189]. In non-responders or patients in whom clinical effects are insufficient, it is necessary to switch the antimicrobial drug. PIPC, CTX, and CTRX have stable antimicrobial activities. When reviewing the clinical effects of PIPC on childhood bronchopulmonary infection, the response rate was 95%; the results were satisfactory [205].-Concerning treatment for M. catarrhalis pneumonia, M. catarrhalis produces \u03b2-lactamase. However, when examining the clinical course, AMPC is effective [205], [206]. This is because the enzymatic activity of \u03b2-lactamase produced by M. catarrhalis is low [207].-Concerning treatment for Mycoplasma pneumonia, a recent increase in the number of macrolide-resistant M. pneumoniae strains must be considered [202]. In Japan, an outbreak of M. pneumoniae infection occurred in mid-2011, and persisted until 2012. The outbreak involved a large number of patients with macrolide-resistant M. pneumoniae infection. Diagnosis and treatment were confused [209], [210]. Concepts regarding the diagnosis and treatment of childhood Mycoplasma pneumonia proposed by the Committee to Prepare the Guidelines for the Management of Respiratory Infectious Diseases in Children and Vaccination/Infection Control Committee, Japan Pediatric Society as of February 19, 2013 are presented [211] (Table 14).\n",

In children, disease progression is often prompt, and the first evaluation should be performed after 2 days in younger and severe-status children, and not after 3 days [189]. If an improvement in clinical symptoms or laboratory data is achieved, the same antimicrobial drug should be continued until an appropriate antimicrobial drug and drug susceptibility are clarified. With respect to the administration period of antimicrobial drugs, factors such as the type of causative microorganisms and patient background differ among individual patients; therefore, it is difficult to establish standardized criteria. As M. pneumoniae and C. pneumoniae slowly proliferate, the treatment period is prolonged (Table 15). In patients infected with general bacteria, the administration of antimicrobial drugs can be discontinued 3 days after pyretolysis [189]. However, further antimicrobial drug therapy is necessary to treat S. aureus pneumonia.",

In addition, not only general bacteria but also fungus and viruses sometimes cause hospital-acquired pneumonia in patients with immunodeficiency. Among patients with nosocomial infection, causative microorganisms differ, and drug-resistant microorganisms are involved in many cases. In children, it is not easy to investigate causative microorganisms, but, if drug susceptibility is clarified, it contributes to successful treatment.

With respect to the administration period of antimicrobial drugs, factors such as the type of causative microorganisms and patient background differ among individual patients with nosocomial infection; therefore, it is difficult to establish standardized criteria. However, when complications such as severe immunodeficiency, pulmonary suppuration, lung abscess, and pleuritis are absent, antimicrobial drugs should be administered for 5 days after pyretolysis (7\u201310 days) [50]. Considering an underlying disease or the immune state, flexible management must be performed. In children, disease progression is often prompt, and the first evaluation should be performed after 2 days in younger and severe-status children, and not after 3 days [189]. If an improvement in clinical symptoms or laboratory data is achieved, the same antimicrobial drug should be continued until an appropriate antimicrobial drug and drug susceptibility are clarified. When the type of microorganisms that caused pneumonia is identified, a target-focused antimicrobial drug should be selected through de-escalation, considering drug susceptibility and pharmacokinetics [211].",

To achieve multidisciplinary, comprehensive treatment to save children, it is necessary to cooperate with other special fields.",

Among immunodeficiency patients with hyper-IgM-emia, Pneumocystis pneumonia should be considered in those with conditions related to CD40 ligand abnormalities.\u2781Cellular immunodeficiency: In addition to infection with general bacteria, infection with intracellular parasitic bacteria, fungus, or Protozoa may become severe, and be protracted. As the differentiation and induction of B and killer T cells by CD4-positive lymphocytes are affected, the eradication of virus-infected cells is inhibited (Table 17) [215].\n\u2782Neutrophil abnormalities: Neutrophil abnormalities are classified into two types: neutropenia and neutrophil functional disorders. Patients with a peripheral blood absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of <500/\u03bcL or those in whom the ANC is estimated to reach <500/\u03bcL within 48 h are regarded as having neutropenia [215]. Of these, the risk is higher in patients with an ANC of 100/\u03bcL or less in whom the period is estimated to exceed 7 days. Many patients with neutropenia do not show purulent sputum or abnormal findings on chest X-ray even in the presence of pneumonia. Therefore, when fever persists, thoracic CT should be performed in the early stage. All microorganisms including general bacteria (gram-positive bacteria, gram-negative bacteria), fungus, and viruses may cause pneumonia. In particular, in addition to neutropenia early after homologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, infection-prone features associated with humoral/cellular immunodeficiency related to the administration of immunosuppressives persist over a long period. Furthermore, the concomitant development of acute/chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is a risk factor for the onset of pneumonia. In addition, non-infectious pulmonary disorder related to drugs/radiation for pretreatment may occur, and it is important to differentiate it from infectious diseases (Fig. 9) [214], [216].\nA representative neutrophil functional disorder, chronic granulomatosis, induces active oxygen production disorder of neutrophils, affecting bactericidal actions. Therefore, patients with this disorder are prone to be infected with non-H2O2-producing catalase-positive bacteria (S. aureus, K. pneumoniae, E. coli, Candida spp., Aspergillus spp.).\u2783Complement deficiency: Patients with complement deficiency are prone to be infected with bacteria with capsules, such as S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae (capsule strains), and Neisseria meningitidis\n[214].\n",

Other etiological factors for pyothorax include surgery, trauma, and esophageal perforation.-Microorganisms that cause pyothorax depend on its etiology and course. In the presence of bacterial pneumonia, pyothorax is caused by the same microorganisms as caused bacterial pneumonia. Furthermore, acute pyothorax is frequently caused by S. pneumoniae and S. aureus. However, in many patients with chronic pyothorax, mixed infection primarily with anaerobes is involved. Among anaerobes, Fusobacterium spp. (especially Fusobacterium nucleatum), Prevotella spp., Peptostreptococcus spp., and Bacteroides spp. are frequently detected [232], [233], [234]. According to recent studies, the detection rate of the Streptococcus anginosus group is high [235], [236].-In many cases, pyothorax with a relatively slow course is associated with M. tuberculosis. It must be considered that pulmonary lesions do not always concurrently exist with tuberculous pleuritis.\n",

An antimicrobial drug with an activity against microorganisms expected or obtained on culture should be selected and administered. In acute-onset patients in whom there is no risk of resistant bacteria, for example, those with pyothorax accompanying community-acquired pneumonia, antimicrobial drugs such as PCG and ABPC should be initially selected, considering S. pneumoniae. These drugs simultaneously cover Fusobacterium, Peptostreptococcus, and the viridans Streptococcus group. However, Prevotella and Bacteroides produce \u03b2-lactamase; therefore, when the results of culture are not obtained, combination therapy with antimicrobial drugs with activities against anaerobes, such as CLDM and MNZ, or therapy with such a single drug, such as SBT/ABPC, should be selected.-When there is a risk of multi-drug-resistant bacteria, monotherapy with a carbapenem should be selected as a first choice, assuming ESBL-producing enteric bacteria, resistant P. aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter. A fourth-generation cephalosporin should be combined with CLDM, or a quinolone should be combined with CLDM or SBT/ABPC.-If the results of culture/susceptibility tests are clarified, antimicrobial drugs should be changed in accordance with them. However, the culture of anaerobes is difficult, or is not conducted in some cases. Therefore, this should be confirmed to the laboratory. When only one type of bacteria are detected on a culture test despite several types of bacteria detected on Gram staining of pleural effusion, anaerobes must also be considered.-The penetration of aminoglycosides to the thoracic cavity is poor, and their activities reduce when the pH is low. Therefore, for pyothorax treatment, the use of aminoglycosides should be generally avoided [237], [238], [239], [240].\n",

Subsequently, as a rule, standard treatment (A), in which two drugs, INH and RFP, are administered for 4 months, should be performed as maintenance treatment (AI).-When PZA cannot be used for initial treatment for some reason, INH, RFP, and EB or SM, should be administered for 2 months as initial treatment. Subsequently, standard treatment (B), in which two drugs, INH and RFP, are administered for 7 months, should be performed as maintenance treatment (AII).-In patients in whom chest X-ray shows a cavity on initial consultation to during initial treatment and the septum culture is still positive at the completion of initial treatment, maintenance treatment should be prolonged over 3 months. In addition, the prolongation of maintenance treatment should also be considered in patients with severe tuberculosis, such as military tuberculosis and tuberculosis of the central nervous system, those with immune depression, and those with relapse of tuberculosis (AII).-For the treatment of latent tuberculosis infection, INH should be administered for 6 or 9 months (AI). When M. tuberculosis, as the source of infection, is resistant to INH, or when the oral administration of INH is difficult due to side effects, RFP should be used as a second-choice drug for 4 or 6 months (AI).- - - Explanation- - --Standard treatment for tuberculosis in the 1950's was combination therapy with INH, SM, and PAS for 18 months. In 1968, RFP became commercially available. In the 1970's, controlled studies in England indicated the usefulness of short-term combination chemotherapy with RFP for 6 months [248], [249]. Thereafter, the efficacy of short-term combination chemotherapy with PZA for 2 months after the start of treatment was demonstrated [250], [251], [252]. In 1998, the British Thoracic Society recommended that conventional drugs, INH, RFP, and PZA, should be combined with SM or EB for the first 2 months, assuming that the rate of INH-resistant M. tuberculosis will increase. It was also recommended that, if a smear test becomes negative within 2 months and there is no drug resistance, INH and RFP, should be used for the subsequent 4 months (total: 6-month treatment) [253].-Both the Guidelines for the Management of Tuberculosis in Japan, Revision No. 2, which was published in 2012, and Document regarding Tuberculosis Treatment, which was agreed by the ATS/CDC/IDSA in the United States and announced in 2003, recommended that INH, RFP, PZA, and EB or SM, should be administered for the first 2 months, and that INH and RFP, should be administered for the subsequent 4 months, as the most standard, evidence-based treatment method [254], [255]. In particular, this method is named \u201cstandard treatment (A)\u201d in the Guidelines for the Management of Tuberculosis in 2012 in Japan. In this article, this name is also used.-The secondary assessment of a study examining the efficacy of rifapentine and INH showed that factors for unsuccessful treatment/recurrence included a cavity on chest X-ray at the start of treatment and positive findings on culture at the completion of initial treatment for 2 months [256]. Similarly, when the treatment period was extended from 6 to 8 months in patients with silicotuberculosis, in whom the unsuccessful treatment/recurrence rates are high, the recurrence rate decreased from 22 to 7%. Therefore, various guidelines recommend that maintenance treatment should be prolonged over 3 months in patients with a cavity and those showing positive findings on septum culture at the completion of initial treatment [254], [255].-In 1990, Combs et al. compared the results of treatment between a group treated with INH, RFP, and PZA for 2 months and, then, with INH and RFP for 4 months and that treated with INH and RFP for 9 months, and reported that the efficacy and incidence of side effects were similar [257]. Based on such a study, the following regimen is recommended as standard treatment (B) in the Guidelines for the Management of Tuberculosis in 2012 in Japan: when PZA cannot be used for some reason, INH, RFP, and EB or SM, are administered for the first 2 months, and, subsequently, two drugs, INH and RFP, are administered for 7 months.-Patients who are infected with M. tuberculosis, but do not develop tuberculosis are regarded as having latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI). INH administration for LTBI decreases the incidence of tuberculosis by 25\u201392% [258]. Previously, this was called preventive therapy, but is currently termed LTBI treatment. The decrease in the incidence of tuberculosis is correlated with compliance with INH, and more marked preventive effects may be achieved when compliance is higher [258], [259], [260]. In a study involving INH administration to LTBI patients with an old shadow on chest X-ray, this therapy inhibited the onset of tuberculosis in 65 and 75% of patients treated for 6 and 12 months, respectively (there was no significant difference between the two groups) [261]. Based on the data, some studies recommended that the period of standard INH administration for LTBI should be 9 months [262], [263], [264]. However, a consensus regarding an effective administration period (6 or 9 months) has not been reached from various aspects including the efficacy, compliance, expenses, and incidence of side effects. Actually, the administration period should be determined based on compliance and the incidence of side effects.-In LTBI treatment, RFP should be used for 4 or 6 months as an alternative drug when the oral administration of INH is impossible for some reason. The preventive effects of RFP on the onset of tuberculosis in LTBI patients may be similar to those of INH. Furthermore, the incidence of liver dysfunction is lower than that related to INH [265], [266], [267]. However, for the use of RFP, drug interactions must be considered.- - - Drugs to be recommended- - -\u2666First choice-INH, oral, 5 mg/kg/once a day (maximum: 300 mg/day) + RFP, oral, 10 mg/kg/once a day (maximum: 600 mg/day, orally administered before meals as a rule) + PZA, oral, 25 mg/kg/once a day (maximum: 1500 mg/day) + EB, oral, 15 mg/kg/once a day (maximum: 750 mg/day) or SM, intramuscular injection, 15 mg/kg/once a day (maximum: 750 mg/day)/2\u20133 times a week.\u2217The above 4 drugs should be administered for 2 months, and, subsequently, two drugs, INH and RFP, should be administered for 4 months.\n\n<>Second choice-INH, oral, 5 mg/kg/once a day (maximum: 300 mg/day) + RFP, oral, 10 mg/kg/once a day (maximum: 600 mg/day, orally administered before meals as a rule) + EB, oral, 15 mg/kg/once a day (maximum: 750 mg/day) or SM, intramuscular injection, 15 mg/kg/once a day (maximum: 750 mg/day)/2\u20133 times a week.\u2217The above 3 drugs should be administered for 2 months, and, subsequently, two drugs, INH and RFP, should be administered for 7 months.\n\n\n2.Non-tuberculous Mycobacterium infectiona.\nMycobacterium avium complex (MAC)- - - Executive summary- - --To treat pulmonary infection with M. avium complex in HIV-negative patients, CAM, RFP, and EB should be administered to those with nodular/bronchodilatation type infection (AI). In severe-status patients and those with cavity-type lesions, the intramuscular injection of SM or KM should be added (BIV).-The treatment period should be at least 12 months after culture becomes negative, but there are no criteria regarding an optimal treatment period (BIV).- - - Explanation- - --In the 1990's, CAM was introduced for the treatment of pulmonary infection with M. avium complex. Before then, combination therapy with antituberculous drugs, such as INH, RFP, and EB, had been used. According to a report from the Research Committee of the British Respiratory Society in 2002, 27 of 75 HIV-negative patients with pulmonary MAC infection died within 5 years, treatment was unsuccessful in 11, and recurrence was noted in 10. CAM was not used in any patient, and there was no correlation between the susceptibility to various antituberculous drugs, such as INH, RFP, and EB, and prognosis [268].-The introduction of CAM for the treatment of pulmonary MAC infection in the 1990's has markedly improved the treatment response and prognosis. Wallace et al. performed combination therapy with CAM (1000 mg/day), EB, RFP (or RBT), and SM in 39 patients with pulmonary MAC infection, and reported that 91% of the patients became negative for MAC [269]. In Japan, Tanaka et al. conducted combination therapy with CAM (10 mg/kg) and EB/RFP/KM in 39 patients, and indicated that 89.5% of those who underwent initial treatment became negative for MAC [270]. Concerning CAM, many studies have reported a correlation between the in vitro drug susceptibility and treatment response [271], [272], [273]. Furthermore, a study indicated that AZM was as effective as CAM [274].-RBT, which was published in the drug price in NHI scheme in Japan in 2008, was also approved for tuberculosis and non-tuberculous Mycobacterium infection, including pulmonary MAC infection. The drug interactions of RBT are less marked than those of RFP, and RBT is used as a first-choice drug for disseminated MAC infection in HIV-infected patients [275]. On the other hand, RBT induces side effects such as uveitis. In elderly patients, in whom pulmonary MAC infection frequently develops, various side effects, such as gastrointestinal disorder, make long-term therapy difficult [276]. In addition, no study has indicated that RBT is more effective than RFP for pulmonary MAC infection in non-HIV-infected patients. Therefore, RFP should be selected as a first-choice drug for pulmonary MAC infection in non-HIV-infected patients.-Kobashi et al. divided 146 patients with pulmonary MAC infection into two groups: a group treated with CAM, RFP, EB, and SM (intramuscularly injected at 15 mg/kg 3 times a week for 3 months) and a group treated with saline, and conducted a randomized, double-blind, comparative study [277]. In the SM-treated group, the rate at which the culture of sputum became negative was higher than in the saline-treated group (71.2 vs. 50.7%, respectively). There has been no high-quality study demonstrating the usefulness of combination therapy with aminoglycosides other than their study. However, various guidelines recommend that combination therapy with SM, AMK, or KM should be performed for 2\u20133 months in the initial phase of treatment in patients with a cavity or severe nodular/bronchodilatation type infection based on experience [276], [278], [279]. Guidelines in the United States recommend SM or AMK, and comment that no study has showed which of two drugs, SM and AMK, is more effective, although SM has been more frequently used [276]. In Japan, SM or KM is recommended [279].-Based on the results of these studies, the Non-tuberculous Mycobacterium Infection Control Committee, Japanese Society for Tuberculosis recommends the following doses and administration methods for chemotherapy for pulmonary MAC infection in the \u201cOpinions regarding Chemotherapy for Pulmonary Non-tuberculous Mycobacterium Infection- - - Revision in 2012\u201d: RFP: 10 mg/kg (up to 600 mg)/day, once a day, EB: 15 mg/kg (up to 750 mg)/day, once a day, CAM: 600\u2013800 mg/day (15\u201320 mg/kg), once a day or two divided doses (800 mg: two divided doses), and SM or KM: 15 mg/kg or less (up to 1000 mg), intramuscularly injected 2 or 3 times a week [279].-A cooperative statement on non-tuberculous Mycobacterium infection by the American Thoracic Society/Infectious Diseases Society of America recommends therapy with CAM at 500 to 1000 mg/day or AZM at 250 mg/day, EB at 15 mg/kg/day, and RFP at 10 mg/kg/day (up to 600 mg) for patients with a cavity or severe nodular/bronchodilatation type infection. In addition, it is recommended that combination therapy with SM or AMK (8\u201310 mg/kg, 2\u20133 times a week, patients aged over 50 years: 500 mg or less) for 2\u20133 months in the initial phase should be considered [276], [280].-The treatment period is established as about 1 year after the culture becomes negative in the above guidelines, but this is not based on evidence. In the Guidelines for the Management of Non-tuberculous Mycobacterium Infection, which were published by the British Thoracic Society, the treatment period of pulmonary MAC infection is established as 2 years. In the future, an optimal treatment period should be investigated.- - - Drugs to be recommended- - --CAM, oral, 200 mg/3 times a day or 400 mg/twice a day + RFP, oral, 10 mg/kg/once a day (maximum: 600 mg/day, orally administered before meals as a rule) + EB, oral, 15 mg/kg/once a day (maximum: 750 mg/day)\u2217Severe-status patients and those with cavity-type lesionsIn addition to the above regimen, the intramuscular injection of SM or KM should be added.\u2217The treatment period should be at least 12 months after culture becomes negative.\n\nb.\nMycobacterium kansasii\n- - - Executive summary- - --To treat pulmonary infection with M. kansasii in HIV-negative patients, INH, RFP, and EB should be administered (AII).-The treatment period should be at least 12 months after culture becomes negative (AI).- - - Explanation- - --Pulmonary infection with M. kansasii is a type of pulmonary non-tuberculous Mycobacterium infection on which drug effects are the most potent. The efficacy of INH, RFP, EB, CAM, and MFLX in vitro has been confirmed. In particular, RFP is an important drug in the treatment of pulmonary infection with M. kansasii. In a retrospective study involving 244 patients with pulmonary infection with M. kansasii, all 32 patients who underwent treatment with RFP became negative for M. kansasii in sputum within 6 months, whereas 80% of 130 patients who underwent RFP-free treatment became negative for M. kansasii in sputum within 6 months [281]. According to a study in Japan, 3 (approximately 1%) of 314 M. kansasii strains were resistant to RFP [282].-Concerning the treatment period, in a prospective study involving 28 non-HIV-infected patients with pulmonary infection with M. kansasii, 14 were treated with 3 drugs, INH, RFP, and EB, for 12 months (EB: for the first 6 months only), and the other 14 were treated with a similar regimen for 18 months. Recurrence was noted in 1 in the former [283]. In both a cooperative statement on non-tuberculous Mycobacterium infection by the American Thoracic Society/Infectious Diseases Society of America and the \u201cOpinions regarding Chemotherapy for Pulmonary Non-tuberculous Mycobacterium Infection- - - Revision in 2012\u201d published by the Non-tuberculous Mycobacterium Infection Control Committee, Japanese Society for Tuberculosis, the treatment period is established as at least 12 months after culture results become negative [276], [279].- - - Drugs to be recommended- - --INH, oral, 5 mg/kg/once a day (maximum: 300 mg/day) + RFP, oral, 10 mg/kg/once a day (maximum: 600 mg/day) + EB, oral, 15 mg/kg/once a day (maximum: 750 mg/day)\u2217The treatment period should be at least 12 months after culture becomes negative.\n\nc.\nMycobacterium abscessus\n- - - Executive summary- - --There is no drug (combination) that can be recommended to treat pulmonary infection with Mycobacterium abscessus.-The drug susceptibility of M. abscessus varies, and a drug susceptibility test should be generally performed. Usually, M. abscessus is susceptible to CAM, AMK, CFX, and IPM/CS. However, it is unclear whether there is a correlation between the drug susceptibility and clinical effects.-Combination therapy with CAM and several intravenous antimicrobial drugs (AMK, CFX, and IPM/CS) may control the symptoms and progression of pulmonary infection with M. abscessus (BIII).-In patients with pulmonary infection with M. abscessus in whom the lesion is localized, cure can be targeted by combining the above drugs with surgical resection (BIII).\n\n\n",

            "text": "- - - Explanation- - --\nM. abscessus is a type of environmental bacteria that proliferate in soil and tap water. It belongs to rapidly growing mycobacteria (RGM). In the United States, Korea, and Taiwan, it is third most commonly detected as a type of non-tuberculous Mycobacterium, following MAC and M. kansasii. Previously, there were many case reports on skin/soft tissue or bone infection. However, recently, respiratory infection has been increasingly reported, accounting for 80% of patients with respiratory infection with RGM [284].-\nM. abscessus is one of the most resistant types of Mycobacterium. In particular, pulmonary infection with M. abscessus is refractory [285]. M. abscessus is resistant to representative oral drugs for Mycobacterium infection, such as INH, RFP, and EB. It may be susceptible to CAM among oral antimicrobial drugs. Its susceptibility to other antimicrobial drugs varies. As a rule, a drug susceptibility test should be performed. Although M. abscessus is sometimes susceptible to AMK, CFX, and IPM/CS, it is unclear whether there is a correlation between the drug susceptibility and clinical effects. In vitro, M. abscessus is sometimes susceptible to LZD, TGC (tigecycline), and ketolides, but it is unclear whether there is a correlation between the drug susceptibility and clinical effects [286], [287].-Combination therapy with CAM and several intravenous antimicrobial drugs (AMK, CFX, and IPM/CS) may control the symptoms and progression of pulmonary infection with M. abscessus\n[288], [289]. However, actually, hospitalization is required to administer these intravenous antimicrobials, and the administration period is limited to 2\u20133 months. Subsequently, treatment with oral drugs is performed, but CAM is the only reliable oral drug, as described above. On the other hand, monotherapy with CAM should be avoided from the perspective of resistance induction. Although some studies reported combination therapy with LZD or quinolones, its efficacy has not been established.-Based on such a background, a combination of surgical resection of the lesion and combination chemotherapy is the only treatment that is expected to achieve the complete cure of pulmonary infection with M. abscessus in which the lesion is localized [284], [288], [289].\n",

When encountering patients with chronic infection who do not respond to general antimicrobial drugs, tuberculosis should be considered for differential diagnosis. Mycobacteria that can be cultured are classified into two types: M. tuberculosis complex and non-tuberculous Mycobacteria (NTM) [247]. M. tuberculosis is a major type of M. tuberculosis complex, and has a strong infectivity from humans to humans. Childhood tuberculosis is classified into two types based on age [247]. Briefly, primary tuberculosis represented by hilar lymph node tuberculosis and meningitis, which develop following primary infection, is characteristic of infants and children. The interval from infection until onset is short, and the morbidity rate is high. In addition, this disease may lead to a severe condition. Pulmonary/hilar lymph node tuberculosis in infants and children is asymptomatic, or the general condition is favorable even in the presence of fever or cough in many cases. When primary tuberculosis is detected based on dyspnea or an unfavorable general condition in addition to fever or cough, many infants/children have military tuberculosis or meningitis. On the other hand, secondary tuberculosis with a cavity lesion or nodular shadow in the lung field is frequent in junior high school students or older. Symptoms such as cough, sputum, fever, and thoracic pain are often observed. In most children, the source of infection can be clarified through detailed peripheral contact screening at the time of onset. Usually, the source of infection is clarified in 2/3 to 3/4 of children. It is often their fathers/mothers or grandfathers/grandmothers [290], [291], [292].",

In many cases, it is difficult to bacteriologically or histologically make a definitive diagnosis in comparison with adult tuberculosis. Usually, it is possible to make a definitive diagnosis by comprehensively evaluating epidemiological/clinical information such as opportunities for the source of infection to contact with tuberculosis patients, tuberculin reaction- or QuantiFERON TB (QFT)-based verification of infection, imaging findings suggestive of tuberculosis, such as chest X-ray findings, verification of M. tuberculosis from sputum or gastric juice, and individuals' resistance including the grade of BCG vaccination-acquired immunity and age, as well as by considering treatment responses in some cases. QFT is a very useful testing method to quantitatively measure IFN-\u03b3 and diagnose tuberculosis infection without being influenced by BCG. However, assessment in infants/children should be further examined in the future [293]. When a definitive diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis cannot be made based on chest X-ray findings alone, thoracic CT, which facilitates the detailed evaluation of the presence or absence and extent of tuberculous lesions, is useful for diagnosis. Furthermore, imaging findings of tuberculosis do not change in a short period in many cases.",

Therefore, it is often detected as a Mycobacterium-positive smear of sputum, that is, Gaffky's positive reaction. Initially, some patients are regarded as having infectious tuberculosis, and admitted to a tuberculosis ward. Symptoms and imaging findings are also similar between non-tuberculous Mycobacterium- and M. tuberculosis-infected patients. Unless detected bacteria are identified, or unless either gene is detected using the nucleic acid amplification method, it is difficult to differentiate the two types of bacteria. However, it is important to recognize that tuberculosis and non-tuberculous Mycobacterium infection are different diseases [276], [294]. The most important point is that non-tuberculous Mycobacterium infection does not transmit from humans to humans, differing from tuberculosis, an infectious disease in humans. Therefore, it is not necessary to isolate the patient, and, as a rule, patients requiring admission should be managed in a general ward. As there are no public hygiene-associated problems, it is not necessary to submit a report to a health center.",

It is necessary to support the resistance and continuation of treatment. In particular, recently, the number of patients in whom it is difficult to continue treatment has increased. Potent compliance support must be considered in connection with direct observed therapy (DOT) by health centers and welfare activities [247]. Side effects during treatment include liver dysfunction. However, if the maximum AST or ALT levels are approximately 100, administration should be carefully continued without discontinuing treatment. If these levels exceed 100, treatment should be transiently discontinued, and additional administration at a low dose should be conducted after confirming the normalization of the liver function. The dose should be gradually increased. Liver dysfunction requiring a change of treatment is not frequent. Furthermore, there is an increase in the serum uric acid level, but continuous treatment leads to normalization. There have been few patients with arthralgia.-Prevention of tuberculosis: To prevent the onset of tuberculosis in uninfected persons, BCG vaccination should be performed. Concerning its efficacy, a consensus regarding its potent preventive effects on severe disseminated tuberculosis, such as tuberculous meningitis and military tuberculosis, has been reached. Considering the importance of tuberculous meningitis prevention, BCG vaccination in the early phase of infancy (5\u20138 months after birth, or earlier in accordance with the state of peripheral tuberculosis prevalence) is still necessary in Japan [290].-Treatment for latent tuberculosis: To prevent the onset of tuberculosis in persons with a history of tuberculosis, treatment for latent tuberculosis (conventional chemoprevention) should be conducted. A large-scale controlled study reported that INH therapy decreased the incidence of tuberculosis by approximately 50\u201360%. For drug administration, the risk of tuberculosis onset should be concretely and flexibly evaluated based on the tuberculin reaction, opportunity of infection, age, and state of BCG vaccination in individual patients [247].-Treatment for non-tuberculous Mycobacterium infection: Non-tuberculous Mycobacterium infection is refractory despite combination therapy with antitubercular drugs. In particular, there is no evidence regarding treatment in children [276]. The effects of monotherapy are weak, and monotherapy with CAM may lead to the appearance of CAM-resistant bacteria within a few months [279]; therefore, this therapy should be avoided. The responses of M. kansasii to antitubercular drugs are relatively favorable, and cure may be achieved. However, pulmonary MAC infection is often resistant to treatment. If there is no response, surgery must be considered. Recurrence after the completion of treatment is also often observed.\n",

When performing antimicrobial drug treatment for acute bronchitis caused by M. pneumoniae or C. pneumoniae, macrolides should be selected as first-choice drugs.

According to a study, the tone of sputum suggests the presence of pathogenic microorganisms rather than the degree of purulence; macroscopic examination is also necessary [319]. Sputum involves much information, and is the most important sample. Samples should be collected before the administration of antimicrobial drugs. Those collected on waking-up early in the morning are ideal. To evaluate the degree of sputum purulence, the Miller & Jones classification [305] (Table 21\n) is used, but, if samples are evaluated as P2 or higher, causative microorganisms may be predicted using Gram staining. On Gram staining, an area where the number of inflammatory cells is large should be initially searched at a low magnification, and detailed observation should be conducted at a high magnification.

However, in Japan, the resistance of S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae to macrolides and \u03b2-lactams is advanced, and P. aeruginosa is also sometimes isolated. Therefore, the use of \u03b2-lactams and macrolides is limited to patients without risk factors. An international comparative study reported that the efficacy of AZM sustained-release preparations was similar to that of new quinolones [327]. However, in Japan, the long-term administration of macrolides is performed in many patients; therefore, circumstances differ.(1)Outpatient treatment\u2666First choices-LVFX, oral, 500 mg/once a day-GRNX, oral, 400 mg/once a day-MFLX, oral, 400 mg/once a day-STFX, oral, 100 mg/1\u20132 times a day\nThese 4 drugs have potent antimicrobial activities against all types of causative microorganisms predicted, and are recommended as first-choice drugs (AII).<>Second choices-CVA/AMPC, oral (125/250 mg), 2 tablets/3\u20134 times a day-SBTPC, oral (375 mg), 1 tablet/3 times a day-AZM sustained-release preparation, oral, 2 g/single dose\n\n(2)Hospital treatment<>Mild cases-CTRX, intravenous drip, 2 g/once a day or 1 g/twice a day-LVFX, intravenous drip, 500 mg/once a day-SBT/ABPC, intravenous drip, 3 g/3\u20134 times a day\n<>Severe cases (P. aeruginosa must be considered.)-MEPM, intravenous drip, 1 g/2\u20133 times a day-DRPM, intravenous drip, 0.5\u20131 g/3 times a day-BIPM, intravenous drip, 0.3\u20130.6 g/3\u20134 times a day-IPM/CS, intravenous drip, 0.5\u20131 g/2\u20134 times a day-TAZ/PIPC, intravenous drip, 4.5 g/3\u20134 times a day-PZFX, intravenous drip, 500 to 1000 mg/twice a day-CPFX, intravenous drip, 300 mg/twice a day-CAZ, intravenous drip, 1\u20132 g/2\u20134 times a day-CFPM, intravenous drip, 1\u20132 g/2\u20134 times a day-CZOP, intravenous drip, 1\u20132 g/2\u20134 times a day-CPR, intravenous drip, 1\u20132 g/2\u20134 times a day\n\u2217Combination therapy with aminoglycosides should be considered in accordance with individual patients.-AMK, intravenous drip, 200 mg/twice a day-GM, intravenous drip, 60 mg/twice a day-TOB, intravenous drip, 90 mg/twice a day\n\n\nb.Definitive therapyRefer to the section \u201c2.1 Community-acquired pneumonia 2.1.2 Definitive therapy\u201d (p. 4).\u2780\nH. influenzae\nBeta-lactamase-producing strains are detected in approximately 10\u201320% of H. influenzae strains. Beta-lactamase-negative, ampicillin-resistant (BLNAR) strains account for approximately 20%. Therefore, when drug susceptibility is unclear, new quinolones should be selected as first-choice oral antimicrobial drugs. If drug susceptibility is clarified, they should be switched to effective and narrow-spectrum drugs. As injection, penicillins should be initially selected, followed by \u03b2-lactamase inhibitor-containing penicillins, carbapenems, and new quinolones.\u2781\nM. catarrhalis\nBeta-lactamase-producing strains account for 100% of M. catarrhalis strains. As oral antimicrobial drugs, macrolides should be initially selected, followed by \u03b2-lactamase inhibitor-containing penicillins, second-/third-generation cephems, and new quinolones. As injection, \u03b2-lactamase inhibitor-containing penicillins, second-/third-generation cephems, new quinolones, or carbapenems should be selected.\u2782\nP. aeruginosa\nAs oral drugs, new quinolones should be selected. As injection, anti-P. aeruginosa penicillins, cephems, monobactums, carbapenems, or new quinolones should be selected. As the drug susceptibility of this type of bacteria markedly differs among strains, drugs should be selected based on the results of culture tests.\u2783\nS. pneumoniae\nAs oral drugs, penicillins should be initially selected, followed by new quinolones. In patients with a risk of resistant bacteria, respiratory quinolones such as LVFX and GRNX should be selected. As injection, penicillins or CTRX should be selected, but carbapenems must be considered in severe-status patients.\u2784\nS. aureus\nConsidering Methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA), drugs such as \u03b2-lactamase inhibitor-containing penicillins, first-/second-generation cephems, and carbapenems should be selected. When Methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) is identified, anti-MRSA drugs should be selected.\u2785\nK. pneumoniae\nSecond-generation cephems should be selected as first-choice drugs. Second-choice drugs include \u03b2-lactamase inhibitor-containing penicillins, second-/third-generation cephems, carbapenems, and new quinolones.\n\n",

For example, even when there is no disappearance of P. aeruginosa on sputum culture, clinical symptoms of DPB will be improved by long-term macrolide therapy. Therefore, the effects of long-term macrolide therapy should be comprehensively evaluated based on changes of symptoms or other laboratory findings as well as the results of sputum culture.-In patients with bronchiectasis or chronic bronchitis, persistent bacterial infection of the lower respiratory tract is also often observed. Several studies have reported the usefulness of long-term macrolide therapy for the management of such a condition, as indicated for DPB treatment [346], [347], [348].-Concerning chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), long-term macrolide therapy with EM or AZM decreases the risk of acutely exacerbating COPD [349], [350].\u2666First choice-EM, oral, 200 mg/2\u20133 times a day\n<>Second choices-CAM, oral, 200 mg/once to twice a day-RXM, oral, 150 mg/once to twice a day\n\n\n\u2781Acute exacerbation-During the clinical course of DPB, acute exacerbations may develop in some cases, as reported for other chronic respiratory diseases. Symptoms such as increases in the frequency of cough/volume of purulent sputum, fever, or respiratory failure will rapidly progress.-As causative microorganisms at the time of acute exacerbation, H. influenzae, S. pneumoniae, M. catarrhalis, and P. aeruginosa are frequently detected, as indicated for persistent infection.-During acute exacerbations, an antimicrobial drug should be additionally administered to cover these causative microorganisms [351].a.Empiric therapyAntimicrobial drugs should be selected in accordance with the section \u201c6.2 Respiratory tract infection in the presence of chronic respiratory disease (COPD, bronchiectasis, old pulmonary tuberculosis, etc.)- - - a.

In double-blind comparative studies involving ABPC and non-treated groups [364], AZM and non-treated groups [365], and ABPC intravenous injection/oral EM and non-treated groups [366], respectively, there were no significant differences in the admission period or symptom improvement. However, a small-scale double-blind comparative study reported that the interval until recovery in the CAM-treated group was shorter than in the non-treated group [367]. According to another study, the incidence of secondary bacterial infection during the course of RS virus-related bronchiolitis was 1.2%, and there was no difference between antimicrobial drug-treated and non-treated groups [368]. Therefore, it is not necessary to administer antimicrobial drugs to children with bronchiolitis for routine treatment or the prevention of secondary bacterial infection. However, follow-up must be carefully continued during the course of bronchiolitis. When a diagnosis of secondary bacterial infection-related pneumonia or otitis media is made, antimicrobial drug therapy should be started.",

Infection occurs through the consumption of freshwater crabs (intermediate host: Eriocheir japonica, E. sinensis, Geothelphusa dehaani) or wild boars (paratenic host:Sus scrofa) contaminated with metacercaria (infective larvae) as a raw or insufficiently cooked food [397].Typical symptoms are cough, sputum, thoracic pain, and exertional dyspnea. In patients with such symptoms, the presence of peripheral blood eosinophilia suggests this disease. In many cases, a diagnosis is made based on the peripheral blood eosinophilia, a history taking of food and immunodiagnosis. Some of paragonimiasis patients are asymptomatic, and the presence of lung lesions is detected on a health checkup. Extrapulmonary paragonimiasis such as cutaneous and cerebral paragonimiasis are classically known form of the ectopic infection with Paragonimus spp. In cases of cutaneous paragonimiasis, a slowly moving nodular lesion in the subcutaneous tissue is a characteristic symptom. The worms may migrate through mediastinal soft tissues to the brain, causing eosinophilic meningitis or cerebral paragonimiasis in some cases [397]. Since Paragonimus spp. is widely distributed around the world, Japanese travel to endemic area such as China, Korea, Thailand, and Philippines possible to infect with Paragonimus spp. As well as foreign patients from endemic areas, this disease always is considered when a patient has respiratory symptoms and/or lung lesions with eosinophilia [398].Chest X-ray findings vary: not only pulmonary parenchymal lesions, such as nodular (\u00b1cavity formation) and infiltrative shadows, but also pleural lesions, such as the retention of pleural effusion and pneumothorax, are sometimes observed [399]. Many patients show peripheral blood eosinophilia and/or elevated serum total IgE. Immunodiagnosis to detect parasite-specific antibody has been proven as the most useful and reliable tool. Not only patient's serum but also pleural effusion could examine by immunological test. Commercially available anti-parasite antibody screening test is including Paragomimus spp. In Japan, egg-detection rate among paragonimiasis patients nowadays is low; for example 51.2% in sputum and 53.8% in BALF [66], 66.7% in bronchoscopic aspirate [397], [399].After a definitive diagnosis is made, oral treatment should be started. The type of treatment to be selected, outpatient or hospital treatment, depends on the patient's general condition. However, usually, outpatient treatment is possible. In patients having pleural effusion, pleural fluid must be extensively drained off before starting chemotherapy [400] (BIII). In patients with chronically encapsulated pleural effusion, surgery is required [401] (CIII).- - - Drugs to be recommended- - -\u2666First choice (same dose for adults and children)-Praziquantel, oral, 25 mg/kg/3 times a day, 2\u20133 days [402] (AIII)\n\n\u25a0\nA. lumbricoides, A. duodenale, N. americanus\nThe larvae of these parasites pass through the lung in the human body, causing asthma- or pneumonia-like symptoms such as transient fever, cough, and dyspnea. On chest X-ray, transient nodular/infiltrative shadows are observed. Many patients show peripheral blood eosinophilia and/or elevated serum total IgE. Previously, the condition was called Loffler syndrome. Currently, it is classified as simple pulmonary eosinophilia in the category of PIE syndrome [402].Symptoms appear 1\u20132 weeks after the oral ingestion of A. lumbricoides embryonated eggs. The latency period of percutaneous infection with N. americanus larvae or percutaneous/oral infection with A. duodenale larvae is approximately 10 days. Larvae appeared in the small intestine penetrate the intestinal wall, enter the portal vein, migrate through liver to heart/lung. Larvae penetrate the human skin transfer to the lung with blood flow. Then these larvae migrate up the bronchi and trachea, over the epiglottis, down the esophagus/stomach, and reach the small intestine. In the intestine the larvae develop into mature adults [403].Simple pulmonary eosinophilia related to parasites spontaneously resolved in a few weeks. In many cases, a definitive diagnosis is made based on parasite eggs detected on a stool examination, although larvae are sometimes detected in sputum [403].- - - Drugs to be recommended- - -\u2666First choice (same dose for adults and children)-Pyrantel pamoate, oral, 10 mg/kg/single-dose administration\u2217Dry syrup for children is available.\u2217This drug is effective for adult worms in the intestinal tract, but not for larvae migrating in the human body. Therefore, a stool examination should be performed 2 weeks after oral administration. If parasite eggs are detected, additional administration should be conducted.\n\n<>Second choices (same dose for adults and children)-Albendazol, oral, 400 mg/single-dose administration-Mebendazole, oral, 100 mg/twice a day, 3 days, or 500 mg/single-dose administration-Ivermectin, oral, 150\u2013200 \u03bcg/kg/single-dose administration (after fasting)\n\n\u25a0\nS. stercoralis\nIn Japan, S. stercoralis is distributed in Nansei Islands, chain of islands extending from southwestern Kyushu to northern Taiwan. There are few young persons newly infected with S. stercoralis, but the incidence of infection is high in elderly persons [404]. Internationally, S. stercoralis is widely distributed in tropical/subtropical areas. Not only domestic infection but also Japanese travel to endemic area possible to infect with this parasite. Foreign patients from endemic areas, strongyloidiasis always considered when a patient has respiratory symptoms and/or lung lesions with eosinophilia.\nS. stercoralis percutaneously infects humans. Larvae penetrate the human skin transfer to the lung with blood flow. Then these larvae migrate up the bronchi and trachea, over the epiglottis, down the esophagus/stomach, and reach the small intestine. In the intestine the larvae develop into mature adults. Parasite eggs delivered by adults are hatched while descending the intestinal tract, and larvae excreted in stools. Some larvae developed to infective form again invade/transfer through the mucosa around the anus, maintaining a life cycle in the human body. Such a mode of infection is termed autoinfection.With the transfer of larvae to the lung, asthma- or pneumonia-like symptoms, such as transient fever, cough, and dyspnea, appear, as indicated for simple pulmonary eosinophilia related to A. lumbricoides, A. duodenale, or N. americanus. On chest X-ray, transient nodular/infiltrative shadows are observed. Many patients show peripheral blood eosinophilia and/or an increase in the total IgE level.In immunocompromised patients, suppressing the cell-mediated immunity such as ATL patients, HIV/AIDS patients, those receiving immunosuppressive drugs, the number of S. stercoralis increases through acceleration of autoinfection, and larvae are disseminated in various organs, leading to a severe condition (disseminated strongyloidiasis). In such cases, stridor, bloody sputum, tachypnea, protein-losing gastroenteritis, ileus, and mobile exanthema are observed. Furthermore, severe pneumonia related to enteric bacteria disseminated with larvae, lung abscess, or bacterial meningitis concomitantly occurs [403]. A diagnosis is made based on S. stercoralis larvae detected in stools/sputum. Immunological diagnosis is also useful [403].- - - Drugs to be recommended- - -\u2666First choice (same dose for adults and children)-Ivermectin, oral, 200 \u03bcg/kg/single-dose administration (after fasting), additional administration at the same dose after 2 weeks (AI)\u2217Repeated administration must be considered in cases of disseminated strongyloidiasis [405].\u2217A study reported that transrectal or percutaneous administration was useful in patients in whom oral administration was difficult due to digestive symptoms [406].\n\n<>Second choice (same dose for adults and children)-Albendazol, oral, 400 mg/twice a day, 7 days (BI)\n\n\u25a0\nT. canis, T. cati\nInfection to humans occurs through the oral ingestion of the embryonated eggs of T. canis or T. cati\n[407]. It also occurs through the consumption of beef/chicken liver or meat contaminated with larvae as a raw or insufficiently heated food. This is considered to be a dominant route of infection in Japan [407]. As humans are not definitive host for T. canis and T. cati, they do not become adults in the human body [408]. Larvae invading the human body transfer to various organs with blood flow through the intestinal mucosa. Target organs are the lung, liver, eyes, and central nervous system including spinal cord. Toxocariasis is a typical larva migrans.Lesions are often observed in the lung/liver (visceral larva migrans). There are few symptoms, or nonspecific symptoms are present. In many cases, a diagnosis is made based on peripheral blood eosinophilia and multiple nodular shadows of the lung or liver on CT. Ocular or central nervous symptoms appear in some patients. It is impossible to make a diagnosis on a stool examination due to larva migrans. Immunological diagnosis is useful. After a definitive diagnosis is made, treatment should be started. When visceral larva migrans is asymptomatic, follow-up may be continued.- - - Drugs to be recommended- - -\u2666First choice (same dose for adults and children)-Albendazol, oral, 5 mg/kg/2 or 3 times a day, 4\u20138 weeks [409] (BIII)\u2217This drug should be taken with meals for 28 days. A 14-day period of discontinuation should be established and then restarted drug if required.\n\n<>Second choices (same dose for adults and children)-Albendazol, oral, 400 mg/twice a day, 5 days [410] (BIII)-Mebendazole, oral, 100\u2013200 mg/twice a day, 5 days [411] (CIII)\n\n\u25a0\nW. bancrofti, B. malayi\n\nW. bancrofti and B. malayi are called lymphatic filaria. Infection occurs when these parasites are transmitted to humans through mosquitoes. The pathogenesis of lymphatic filariasis is relate to structural and functional abnormality of lymphatic channels induced by parasitized adult worms. Infection with W. bancrofti is characterized by febrile attacks, lymphedema/elephantiasis, hydrocele, and chyluria. In patients infected with B. malayi, neither hydrocele nor chyluria is observed, and lymphedema of the lower limbs/elephantiasis are localized in the lower thighs. Microfilaria produced by adult worms is not pathogenic, but rarely induces allergic reactions in the lung, contributing to tropical pulmonary eosinophilia (TPE) [403]. This condition shows a chronic course, differing from simple pulmonary eosinophilia. Cough, dyspnea, and stridor with exacerbation at night are observed. Fever, malaise, and weight loss are noted in some patients. On chest X-ray, bilateral reticular nodular lesions are detected. Peripheral blood eosinophilia and an increase in the anti-filaria antibody titer are observed. In case of TPE, no microfilaria is detected [403]. If treatment is not performed, the condition may gradually exacerbate. It is important to adequately make a diagnosis for the differentiation of this disease. In the world, 130,000,000 persons are infected with lymphatic filaria, but TPE occurs in less than 0.5% of these. The risk of this disease in travelers is unclear, and most patients consist of foreign persons from endemic areas [412].- - - Drugs to be recommended- - -\u2666First choice (same dose for adults and children)-Diethylcarbamazine, 2 mg/kg/3 times a day, 12 days\u2217In cases of malayan filariasis, marked side effects, such as digestive symptoms, fever, lymphangitis/lymphadenitis, and orchitis/epididymitis, may appear. Therefore, a half dose (1 mg/kg) should be administered 3 times a day for 12 days [413].\n\n\n\u25a0\nD. immitis\n\nD. immitis parasitize in the dog right ventricle and pulmonary artery, where mature female worms produce microfilaria that circulate in peripheral blood. Infection to humans is mediated by microfilaria-ingesting mosquitoes. D. immitis larvae in human subcutaneous tissue inserted by mosquito bite, some larvae migrate to the heart and die. Dead worms produce infarcts then they lodge in pulmonary vessels. There are few symptoms [402]. In patients with symptoms, thoracic pain, cough, bloody sputum, stridor, and fever have been reported. Typical chest X-ray findings include solitary coin lesions. In many cases, an abnormal shadow of the chest X-ray is indicated on a health checkup, and D. immitis infection is pathologically diagnosed from a tissue specimen extirpated under a tentative diagnosis of lung cancer. At this point, peripheral blood eosinophilia is rarely observed [403].- - - Drugs to be recommended (same dose for adults and children)- - --As a diagnosis is made using pathological specimens in many patients, oral treatment is not necessary.-If necessary, diethylcarbamazine at 2 mg/kg should be orally administered 3 times a day for 12 days.- - - Precautions for each drug- - -\u2780PraziquantelIn the Japanese package inserts, it is described that this drug at 40 mg/kg/day should be orally administered twice a day for 2 days for the treatment of paragominiasis. However, we recommend administration at 75 mg/kg/day (3 times a day) for 2\u20133 days based on Reference No. 400.The incidence of side effects is low, but fever, abdominal discomfort, nausea, diarrhea, and headache are sometimes observed.Drug to be contraindicated for combination therapy: RFPPrecautions for combination therapy: Decrease in the blood concentration: dexamethasone, phenytoin, carbamazepine, chloroquineIncrease in the blood concentration: cimetidine\u2781Pyrantel pamoatePatients can take this drug regardless of meals. There are few side effects.\u2782AlbendazolThis drug should be taken with meals for 28 days. A 14-day period of discontinuation should be established and then restarted drug if required.As liver dysfunction is frequently observed, caution is needed during the administration period. Bone marrow suppression and Stevens-Johnson syndrome must also be considered.Precautions for combination therapy: Decrease in the blood concentration: ritonavir, phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbitalIncrease in the blood concentration: praziquantel\u2783MebendazoleAlthough this drug has been used in few children, the same dose as established for adults is used. In children weighing 20 kg or less, a half dose should be used. This drug is contraindicated for pregnant women or those who may be pregnant. Combination therapy with cimetidine may increase the blood concentration of mebendazole. Combination therapy with metronidazole may cause toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) and Stevens-Johnson syndrome.\u2784IvermectinAfter fasting, this drug should be taken with water. The incidence of side effects is low, but nausea/vomiting and mild hepatic disorder are sometimes observed. The safety of this drug in pregnant women or children weighing less than 15 kg has not been established. To these patients, this drug should be administered only when its therapeutic advantage is considered to exceed its risk.\u2785DiethylcarbamazineAs side effects, fever, lymphangitis/lymphadenitis, and orchitis/epididymitis, which result from anti-parasitic actions, are observed in addition to abdominal discomfort, nausea, and abdominal pain. The safety of this drug in pregnant women has not been established.\n\n",
