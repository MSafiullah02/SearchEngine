Patients experiencing critical illness are at risk for common global neurologic disturbances, such as delirium, long-term cognitive dysfunction, ICU-acquired weakness, sleep disturbances, recurrent seizures, and coma.

Cardiovascular disease presents the possibility for CNS injury after cardiac arrest, sequelae of endocarditis, aberrancies of blood fl ow autoregulation, and malperfusion. Respiratory disease is known to cause short-term effects of hypoxia and long-term effects after ARDS. Sepsis encephalopathy and sickness behavior syndrome are early signs of infection in patients.

Neurologic failure is an important sign which may herald a treatable underlying disease. It is related to many factors: changes in infl ammatory and immune signaling, hypoxia, circulatory shock, infection, endocrine changes, metabolic changes, and medications. Acquired neurologic disorders such as delirium and ICU-acquired weakness are independently associated with adverse short-term outcome. Cognitive impairment and neuromuscular weakness are prevalent in survivors of critical illnesses in particular ARDS and sepsis. Given this chronicity, neurologic expressions of critical illness may be viewed as distinct disorders with selfsustaining biological mechanisms rather than dependent processes which resolve with remission of the inciting illness.

Cardinal features are an acute alteration in mental status with inattention, disorganized thinking, and a fl uctuating course. Delirium presents in two motoric subtypes, the more prevalent hypoactive delirium and the more easily recognized hyperactive form. Hyperactive delirium is readily identifi ed, while the hypoactive form may be overlooked and untreated. The incidence of delirium is very high, up to 80 % of mechanically ventilated patients [ 1 ] and 30-40 % of less severe patients in the ICU [ 2 ] . In recent years, the signifi cance of delirium has been recognized beyond the immediate safety of the patient, as delirium in the ICU has been shown to be predictive of mortality [ 1 , 3 , 4 ] , prolonged ICU stay [ 5 ] , increased cost [ 6 ] , and long-term cognitive impairment [ 7 , 8 ] .",

When compared with standard identifi ers, the sensitivity and specifi city of CAM-ICU is good (81 and 96 %) , and the inter-rater reliability is high (kappa 0.79) [ 11 ] . CAM-ICU does not assess the type or severity of delirium; however, the burden of delirium can be quantifi ed by estimating the time a patient is in delirium ( Fig. 21.1 ) [ 12 ] . The Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist (ICDSC) [ 13 ] assigns a numerical score based on the presence or absence of eight characteristics. The ICSDC can be used to identify patients with incomplete presentations who may be at risk for delirium (subsyndromal delirium).",

Benzodiazepines should be avoided whenever possible as they have been shown to increase the likelihood of delirium [ 17 , 18 ] . Medications with anticholinergic side effects, and especially any anticholinergic drug known to cross the blood-brain barrier such as atropine, should be avoided. Sedation protocols and daily interruptions of sedation should be implemented to decrease the exposure to deliriogenic medications and lessen the impact of delirium. Pharmacologic treatment centers on the use of antipsychotic medication both for confusional states and as a mild sedative. Neuroleptic medications such as haloperidol and more recently atypical antipsychotics such as quetiapine and olanzapine have found frequent use in ICU-associated delirium [ 19 -23 ] . These medications work particularly well against agitated symptoms of delirium, but may also be theoretically benefi cial in hypoactive delirium analogously to their benefi ts against the negative symptoms of schizophrenia.

The sickness behavior linked to acute infection (discussion to come) induces daytime hypersomnolence and disruptions in sleep. Pain is common among various critical illness states and may prevent rest at night. Delirium is common in the critically ill, and agitated delirium may keep patients in an animated state, initiating a vicious cycle of sleep deprivation and agitated delirium. Critical illness and the ICU environment are associated with a high likelihood of sleep disruption and deprivation [ 33 -38 ] . Patients are subject to procedures and assessments around the clock, and persistent lighting and noise may remove important cues driving circadian regulation. Noise is a major contributor to sleep impairment in the ICU due to physiologic alarms, overhead paging systems, staff conversations, and radio or television. Mechanical ventilation and patient-ventilator dyssynchrony in particular may disrupt sleep. Assist-control ventilation has been shown to be superior to pressure-support modes if nocturnal hyperventilation results in central apneas and arousals [ 39 ] . Further, proportional assist ventilation (PAV) may be superior to pressure support at night, an effect attributed to improved ventilator tolerance and synchrony [ 40 ] ; additionally, PAV also avoids nocturnal hyperventilation. Medications, including stimulants and catecholamine agents, may decrease sleep. Benzodiazepine sedation may decrease REM sleep and the restorative effect of sleep. Continuous polysomnography [ 41 ] studies have documented the marked fragmentation of sleep in the intensive care setting; patients with fragmented sleep spend less time in deeper stages of sleep. With frequent interruptions, the effi ciency of sleep decreases, resulting in lower quality of sleep, although the total time spent in sleep over a 24-h period may be similar to controls.",

The cause for the mortality related to sleep deprivation is not clear. Sleep deprivation alters immune function, but not in a predictable way. Animals may be more likely to survive infl uenza when sleep deprived, but bacterial sepsis becomes increasingly fatal. Sleep deprivation alters metabolism, animals markedly increase caloric intake, but still experience cachexia over time. There is negative nitrogen balance and an overall catabolic state.

As many as 50 % of patients with sepsis, multiorgan failure, or prolonged mechanical ventilation demonstrate evidence of ICU-AW [ 76 ] . Factors associated with ICU-AW include sepsis, systemic infl ammatory response syndrome (SIRS), multiple-system organ failure, renal replacement therapy, mechanical ventilation, catecholamine administration, and poor glycemic control. Exposure to glucocorticoids and the use of neuromuscular blockers (NMBA) in the ICU were implicated in ICU-AW, but have shown inconsistent association with ICU-AW in recent systematic review [ 75 ] . The weakness of ICU-AW is generalized and symmetric. Distal extremity strength such as grip strength may be affected earlier than proximal muscles. Decreased tone is common, and deep tendon refl exes are generally normal to decreased. Weakness may affect the diaphragm leading to prolonged respiratory failure, but facial involvement is rare, as facial grimace is generally preserved. Quantifi cation of the degree of impairment should be done for initial diagnosis and following the progress of disease. The recommended measure of global weakness is the Medical Research Council (MRC) sum score (Table 21 .7 ). The MRC score grades strength in a functional muscle group from 0 to 5. The sum score is generated when three muscle groups are tested from each extremity giving a maximum score of 60. ICU-AW is considered with MRC sum score < 48, severe weakness < 36. The test is repeatable and not costly to perform. Patients must be awake and cooperative for this assessment, and distal extremity strength is not tested.",

Cerebral autoregulation is most protective of hypertensive fl uctuations, but will also allow maintenance of adequate cerebral blood fl ow (CBF) at low blood pressures, provided mean arterial pressures (MAP) exists between 50 and 150 mmHg. In chronic hypertension, the CBF-MAP relationship is shifted to accommodate for the elevated blood pressures, hence increasing the risk of cerebral ischemia at the arterial blood pressure which would be tolerated in normal subjects.

Acute hyponatremia may cause brain edema with clinical signs ranging from confusion to coma and death [ 135 -140 ] . The severity of clinical presentation depends on the rate of decrease and the absolute serum sodium level. Correction of hyponatremia should be achieved in a controlled manner to avoid the development of an osmotic demyelination syndrome. Hypernatremia leads to neurologic dysfunction through a hyperosmolar state that effectively dehydrates the brain. The rate of correction of hypernatremia should also be cautious to prevent the development of cerebral edema. Hypoglycemia can present with encephalopathy or occasionally as focal neurologic defi cits, especially in patients with prior strokes or other brain lesions. Correction of hypoglycemia should be performed rapidly with intravenous dextrose to prevent permanent brain injury. Depending on the severity and duration of hypoglycemia, the clinical response to treatment may lag signifi cantly behind the return to normoglycemia. Severe hyperglycemia resulting from decompensated diabetes mellitus is another important cause of encephalopathy. Brain dysfunction results from serum hyperosmolarity associated with acidosis and electrolyte depletion. Treatment priorities are intravascular volume resuscitation, intravenous insulin, and electrolyte repletion.",
