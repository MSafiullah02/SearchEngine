            "text": "High mannose (HM)-binding algal lectins from blue-green algae (cyanobacteria) and marine macro-algae are promising compounds as potential drugs for the prevention of transmission of various enveloped viruses, such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), influenza virus, hepatitis C virus (HCV), Ebola virus, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [1]. Suppression of virus infection by algal lectins is based on the specific interaction of lectins with target glycans on virus surfaces [2]. For example, cyanobacterial lectins such as cyanovirin-N (CV-N) from Nostoc ellipsosporum\n[3], [4], scytovirin (SVN) from Scytonema varium\n[5], MVL from Microcystis viridis\n[6], microvirin (MVN) from Microcystis aeruginosa\n[7] and OAA from Oscillatoria agardhii\n[8], as well as red algal lectins such as griffithsin from Griffithsia sp. [9] and ESA-2 from Eucheuma serra\n[10], display strong activity with EC50s of pico- or nanomolar levels against HIV infection through specific recognition of HM glycans on the HIV envelope glycoprotein. These anti-HIV lectins are structurally dissimilar and their modes of carbohydrate binding are significantly different except for OAA and ESA-2, both of which have been recently classified into a new lectin family [8]. However, these anti-HIV lectins have several common characteristics, such as amino acid sequence redundancy and exclusive HM oligosaccharide recognition [1].",

In some enveloped viruses, HM type N-glycans are predominantly present on the glycoproteins that are involved in interaction with host cells. Gp120 on the HIV surface, which mediates virus infection through direct binding to the CD4 receptor, is heavily glycosylated with HM glycans [11]. HCV expresses a high level of HM oligosaccharides on its envelope glycoproteins [12]. HM glycans are a major component of the N-glycans of the SARS-CoV spike glycoprotein [13]. Together with the relative abundance of HM glycans on viral surfaces, HM glycans located in close proximity to receptor-binding sites are promising and attractive targets for antiviral HM-binding lectins. In fact, HM-binding algal lectins such as CV-N show a broad range of antiviral activity against various viruses [14], [15], [16], [17], by efficiently inhibiting the initial steps of virus entry into the cells and preventing the further establishment of infection.",

            "text": "Currently, there is a growing public health concern due to the emergence of new influenza viruses, which can potentially cause pandemics. The recently emerged swine-origin H1N1 influenza viruses were very rapidly transmitted from human to human and caused a global pandemic [18]. Antiviral reagents and novel therapeutic concepts are still in high demand, to control these outbreaks, because sufficient vaccine supply is not always available. Highly pathogenic virus strains such as avian H5N1 have been a global threat in recent years and mutations of these viruses, which can result in easier human-to-human transmission, has become a reality due to reassortment in host animals. In fact, pandemic H1N1-2009 and a H5N1 virus are reported to have a high genetic compatibility and reassortment between these two viruses can occur, which could create pandemic H5N1 viruses [19]. The emergence of recent pandemic swine-origin influenza virus as well as the ongoing threat of the outbreak of highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza viruses led us to explore new antiviral agents. During the course of this survey, we found that the lectin KAA-2 from the marine red alga Kappaphycus alvarezii has strong anti-influenza activity. In the present study, we have clarified and defined the oligosaccharide binding specificity of KAA-2 and evaluated its inhibitory potency against influenza virus infection.",

The amount of bound PA-oligosaccharide was obtained by subtracting the amount of unbound oligosaccharide from the amount of added oligosaccharide, which was determined from the filtrate of the reaction solution without a lectin.

            "text": "The oligosaccharide binding specificity of the algal lectin KAA-2 from K. alvarezii was determined using a conventional carbohydrate binding assay with fluorescence-labeled oligosaccharide. The oligosaccharide structures used in this study are shown in Fig. 1\nA. Of the 38 kinds of PA-oligosaccharides tested, KAA-2 exclusively bound to HM type N-glycans (Nos. 13\u201322) (Fig. 1B) and did not recognize other N-glycans including complex type (Nos. 1\u201312), hybrid type (Nos. 23\u201325) and the pentasaccharide core of N-glycans (No. 26) (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, oligosaccharides from glycolipids (Nos. 27\u201333) exhibited no interaction with this lectin. KAA-2 exhibited a binding preference for an exposed \u03b11\u20133 Man on the D2 arm of a HM type oligosaccharide in a similar manner to ESA-2 and OAA, which constitute a novel anti-HIV lectin family [8]. KAA-2 bound with high binding activity to oligosaccharides with \u03b11\u20133 Man that was highly exposed at the D2 position (Nos. 13, 14, 16, 18 and 21). In contrast, masking of this \u03b11\u20133 Man with \u03b11\u20132 Man dramatically impaired lectin\u2013carbohydrate interaction as observed for oligosaccharides Nos. 15, 17, 19, 20 and 22 (Fig. 1B). These results clearly indicate that KAA-2 specifically recognizes branched oligomannosides of HM type N-glycans and accurately distinguishes subtle differences in the branched portion of the sugar. However, KAA-2 did not interact with any branched oligomannose alone, such as Man(\u03b11\u20132)Man (No. 34), Man(\u03b11\u20133)Man (No. 35), Man(\u03b11\u20136)Man (No. 36), Man(\u03b11\u20136)[Man(\u03b11\u20133)]Man (No. 37), or Man(\u03b11\u20136)[Man(\u03b11\u20133)]Man(\u03b11\u20136)[Man(\u03b11\u20133)]Man (No. 38). This result indicates that a portion of the core N-acetyl-d-glucosamine (GlcNAc) residue(s) of HM type N-glycans is also essential for interaction with KAA-2. The importance of reducing terminal GlcNAc residue(s) was most obvious when the binding activities of Man5GlcNAc2 (No. 13, 95.8%) and Man5 (No. 38, 1.5%) were compared.",

In this study, we demonstrated that the HM-binding lectin KAA-2 from the red alga K. alvarezii showed strong anti-influenza activity against a broad range of influenza virus strains, including the recently emerged swine-origin H1N1 influenza viruses. This lectin efficiently inhibited influenza virus infection with EC50s of low nanomolar levels. Furthermore, KAA-2 showed intense activity against various influenza strains, regardless of the virus subtype and strain. Intriguingly, it was reported that recent pandemic H1N1 viruses were resistant to the antiviral activities of HM-binding innate immune proteins such as surfactant protein D (SP-D) and mannose-binding lectin (MBL), but the seasonal H1N1 strains are susceptible to these proteins [21]. In contrast, KAA-2 strongly inhibited infection of pandemic H1N1 virus as well as seasonal strains, although, A/PR8/34 (H1N1), which is devoid of glycosylation site on HA [21], was the only resistant strain to KAA-2. In terms of practical application for medicinal use, this strain-independent inhibition by KAA-2 might be more advantageous than antibody-based medicines that are susceptible to antigenic drift or antigenic shift.",

KAA-2 or yeast mannan was immobilized onto the ELISA plate and incubated with an influenza vaccine which contains HA from a mixture of influenza viruses: A/California/7/09 (H1N1); A/Victoria/210/09 (H3N2), and B/Brisbane/60/08. The wells were incubated with mouse anti-HA monoclonal antibody for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C followed by with HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C. Subsequently, the HRP substrate, TMB, was added to each well and the absorbance at 450 nm was measured. Absorbance is expressed as the average value of duplicate assays. (B) The plate coated with KAA-2 was incubated with varying concentrations of yeast mannan at the room temperature for 1 h. Subsequently, the plate was incubated with the influenza vaccine (3 \u03bcg/ml) and assayed in the same way as above.",
