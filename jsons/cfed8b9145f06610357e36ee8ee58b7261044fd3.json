            "text": "For almost three decades, transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGE), a coronavirus, was the only known viral agent to cause severe neonatal diarrhoea in pigs, giving rise to considerable losses (1). Recently, a number of other viruses have been shown to be involved in the aetiology of diarrhoea in pigs, namely rotaviruses (9, 1 l), the epizootic diarrhoea virus (another coronaviruslike agent not related to TGE virus, 4, 8, 14) , rotavirus-like, calici-virus-like and 23 nm virus-like particles (18). Present evidence suggests that in addition to TGE virus, rotaviruses and epizootic diarrhoea virus are widespread and of considerable economic importance. The clinical and epizootiological picture of infections with these three agents is similar (3, 5, 15) and differential diagnosis is difficult. Furthermore, histological findings in the small intestine, which is the target organ of these viruses, reveal remarkable similarities. Since the histological and ultrastructural changes of natural and experimental TGE and rotavirus infections are known from a number of studies (10, 12, 16, 17), it is of interest to investigate the pathological changes caused by epizootic diarrhoea virus and compare them with TGE and rotavirus infections.

The findings for TGE and rotavirus-induced intestinal lesions confirm earlier results obtained by others hours p. inf. These differences may be dependent on the virulence of the strain used or on the virus dose given. The lack of villous atrophy in naturally EVD virus-infected newborn piglets compared to weanlings which were investigated only a few hours after the onset of diarrhoea may have been due to milk antibodies which could have a delaying influence on the development of morphological lesions in the intestine.",

If these results can be confirmed in future studies, the localization of virus replication could possibly be a property which could be used for differentiation of TGE virus from EVD virus in infected small intestines. In this respect rotavirus infection does not present difficulties because of its different morphology and mode of replication. The results obtained in this study on the infection of the small intestine with rotaviruses are well in accordance with data reported by others (10, 11, 17, 20) . The ultrastructural investigation of the lamina propria and regional lymph nodes revealed virus-containing cells in piglets experimentally infected with EVD virus. This suggests uptake of virus-containing cells by macrophages which are present in the lamina propria, and transport of the macro hages to the lymph nodes where virus degradation takes tact virus particles resemble lysosomes, or are similar to structures described in connection with the replication of a human coronavirus in cell cultures (13), cannot be ascertained. Because replication of enteropathogenic coronaviruses has not been reported in other cells than differentiated small intestine enterocytes, one would be hesitant to compare these structures to the membranebound viral factories reported by DOUGHRI et al.

Summary Light microscopic and ultrahistological changes were investigated in the intestines of piglets naturally and experimentally infected with epizootic viral diarrhoea (EVD) virus and compared to those occuring during intestinal TGE and rotavirus infections in piglets. The course of the EVD virus infection is comparable to that of TGE. Villous atrophy develops throughout the jejunum and the ileum as in TGE. In this respect it differs from rotavirus infection. The ultrastructural picture of intestinal EVD virus infection resembles that of TGE and other enteropathogenic coronaviruses. Virus replication, however, was observed mainly in enterocytes located on the lateral walls of the villi extending to the villus/crypt border, and sometimes virus-infected cells were demonstrated in or near the Lieberkuhn's crypts. EVD virus was also demonstrated in macrophages in the intestinal lamina propria and in phagocytes in regional lymph nodes.",
