In addition, with the increase in global population, changes in climatic patterns, and the presence of antibiotic resistant bacteria in waste waters, it is predicted that there will be a rise in waterborne diseases especially diarrhea and cholera. Therefore, still the global populations infants, young, or old are at a risk from waterborne diseases and outbreaks whether the countries are developed or developing or in tropics or temperate in geographical distribution. Hence to minimize the adverse effects from these waterborne pathogens and to improve the water quality, regular monitoring of water sources is essential with advanced but cost-effective detection techniques, precise disinfectant procedures with proper management.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Summary"}], "bib_entries": {"BIBREF0": {"ref_id": "b0", "title": "Winter vomiting disease", "authors": [{"first": "L", "middle": [], "last": "Adler", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "R", "middle": [], "last": "Zickl", "suffix": ""}], "year": 1969, "venue": "J.
