Among the methods of containment have been maintaining physical distances of at least six feet when encountering others, wearing face masks, and more frequent and vigorous hand washing (Centers for Disease Control & Prevention, 2020; World Health Organization, 2020). The primary symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness and dry cough. The virus typically incubates for one to 14 days, with the sufferer experiencing few or no symptoms before full disease expression, and is highly contagious (Lauer et al., 2020). Emerging evidence suggests that COVID-19 has a higher mortality rate than other similar viruses, such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) or Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) (Mahase, 2020). It is highly likely that anxiety about contracting COVID-19 is prominent (Qiu et al., 2020; Wang, Pan, X., & Y., 2020), and thus the study of psychological risk factors is important as part of developing comprehensive approaches for management.",

Responses to past pandemics are instructive on evaluating how anxiety sensitivity and disgust proneness influence broader anxiety reactions to illness risk. For example, in a college student sample (N = 315) disgust sensitivity was a significant predictor of fear of contracting H1N1 (swine flu) in data collected during times of peak media attention to the pandemic in 2009-2010 (Wheaton, Abramowitz, Berman, Fabricant, & Olatunji, 2012). In a student sample (N = 107) gathered during the peak period of concern over contracting Ebola in the United States in late 2014, the physical concerns subscale of the Anxiety Sensitivity Index (ASI-3; Taylor et al., 2007) and disgust sensitivity (assessed with the Disgust Scale-Revised; DS-R, Olatunji et al., 2007) were correlated with fear of contracting the illness, although neither were significant in regression analyses (Blakey, Reuman, Jacoby, & Abramowitz, 2015). Similar findings were observed in a sample of students and other members of a university community (N = 216) during the time of the Zika outbreak, in 2015-2016, where the ASI-3 physical concerns subscale and the DS-R were significantly correlated with fear of contracting the illness, but were not significant predictors in regression analyses (Blakey & Abramowitz, 2017).",

The nature of COVID-19, with particularly significant respiratory symptoms, and respiratory failure as one of the ways in which the virus can be fatal, increases the relevance of anxiety sensitivity. Reviews of the literature have shown that a general fear of respiratory symptoms is associated with anxiety sensitivity (Horenstein, Potter, & Heimberg, 2018). Additional research has demonstrated a significant role for disgust in health-related concerns, such as hypochondriasis (Weck, Esch, & Rohrmann, 2014). Further, considering that recommended public health measures emphasize potential risks for contracting CoV-19 from surfaces and objects, disgust would be expected to additionally contribute to avoidance given its established role in contamination fear (McKay, 2017), particularly disgust sensitivity (Olatunji, Ebesutani, Haidt, & Sawchuk, 2014).",

            "text": "Disgust sensitivity is the extent that one interprets physical sensations as resulting from disgust and the potential of a contaminant being present. Disgust propensity is the extent that one is likely to experience disgust for a range of putative disgust elicitors (van Overveld, de Jong, Peters, Cavanagh, & Davey, 2006). These emotional experiences form a part of the behavioral immune system (BIS; discussed in Taylor, 2019); in short, the BIS is a system of psychological mechanisms that detect cues to the presence of infectious pathogens in the immediate environment and trigger disease-relevant emotional (e.g., fear, anxiety, disgust) and cognitive responses that promote the avoidance of disease cues (Schaller & Duncan, 2007). Disgust propensity and sensitivity should moderate the relationship between anxiety sensitivity and COVID-19 anxiety. The rationale for a moderating relationship is that both anxiety sensitivity and disgust have health relevant components. Activation of the BIS increases the disgust salience for objects and situations that were not previously found disgusting. As pandemics such as COVID-19 arouse heightened physical monitoring, when present in conjunction with disgust propensity and sensitivity, it is expected that fear of contracting CoV-19 would be heightened.",

            "text": "The conjoint roles of anxiety sensitivity and disgust propensity and sensitivity reflect an environmental activation of the BIS (Schaller & Duncan, 2007). The BIS is activated as an additional safeguard against infection when the risk is not visible to the naked eye. Therefore, anxiety sensitivity, which activates appraisals of changes in physiological reactions as signs of potential danger, along with disgust propensity and sensitivity which appraises specific infection risks, would be expected to be marshaled in protecting against infection when information about increased risks become known (discussed in Taylor, 2019). What is less clear is the extent that disgust propensity and sensitivity, and anxiety sensitivity, might work together. On the one hand, these could operate concurrently. On the other, since disgust is activated for more specific situations as compared to anxiety sensitivity, which is activated more frequently due to the ongoing daily changes in physical reactivity, disgust would be expected to be a moderator in relation to anxiety sensitivity and anxiety regarding potential infection. As the BIS is activated to detect cues related to potential pathogen infection (Schaller & Park, 2011), this would specifically implicate physical detection via anxiety sensitivity. It would also be expected to heighten disgust awareness, given the role of emotion in protecting against potential harm from pathogens. This potential harm includes pathogen contact that is not oral, such as through the skin (i.e., Tolin, Worhunsky, & Maltby, 2004). This study is the first of its kind to test the relationship between these two disgust-related variables in predicting fear of contracting a pandemic-based infection, such as the one represented in COVID-19.",

WeChat has location-based online groups, and it was arranged for WeChat group moderators from localities within a large urban city in Eastern China (Tianjin, population = 12 million) to invite their residents to participate. Interested participants were shown an online informed consent statement and, for those agreeing, a Chinese language online survey. The survey was hosted on Survey Star, offering features to prevent automated participation by bots. Individuals completing the survey received compensation, randomly allotting a digital payment or voucher, from 3-10 Chinese RMB (roughly equivalent to 0.50-$1.50 USD). Our project was approved by the Tianjin Normal University ethics committee, following the Declaration of Helsinki.",

This suggests that public health approaches to managing anxiety would emphasize that individuals who might be prone to monitoring physical sensations (i.e., respiration, in the case of CoV-19 concerns; Xu et al., 2020) would benefit from education regarding the potential for false alarms regarding these interpretations. Complicating this further in relation to CoV-19 is the long incubation period of the virus, with a carrier potentially being infected for up to 14 days before symptom expression (Lauer et al., 2020). As a result, individuals at risk for significantly heightened anxiety due to COVID-19 may suffer disabling anxiety for up to two weeks following any incidental contact with others whom they believe are hosts for the virus. Further, public information about the contributory factors involved in anxiety regarding contracting COVID-19 is further influenced by one\u2019s propensity to experiencing disgust, and the sensitivity one has to interpreting sensations as emanating from disgust. This is consistent with basic research on the transmissibility of disgust (discussed in McKay, 2017); that is, the degree that an individual is inclined to have an active BIS even in times that are not marked by higher risk of infection will interact with their pre-existing tendency to monitor their physical state for potential changes.",

As individual participants were not interviewed, more detailed evaluations of specific manifestations of the emotional reactions to COVID-19 could be examined. This limitation emerged from active quarantine conditions, and hence in-person questionnaire administration or interviews could not be conducted. Additionally, it is possible that participants self-selected based on their concerns over COVID-19, and thus may not be fully representative of the population affected, such as through quarantine or other closures, by the pandemic. Further, as these data are cross-sectional in nature, we cannot make causal statements regarding the relationship among the study variables. It is expected that the findings from this study can be used as a basis for future investigations either as part of the COVID-19 pandemic, or future pandemics. For example, interview based examinations could further probe the relationship among the variables here, and additional evaluate factors underlying the BIS. Pre-existing concerns with pathogens might be also further evaluated for it\u2019s potential role in activating the BIS and contributing the relationships identified in this study. Prior research has suggested that obsessive-compulsive symptoms may play a role in anxiety sensitivity when considered in the context of prior pandemic fears (i.e., H1N1; Brand, McKay, Wheaton, & Abramowitz, 2013) and thus may serve as an additional focus of investigation. For example, longitudinal studies are needed to determine whether premorbid disgust propensity and sensitivity, anxiety sensitivity, and fear of death, or levels of these traits measured during early periods in the viral outbreak, are associated with fear of contracting COVID-19 infection measured at later periods in the pandemic.",
