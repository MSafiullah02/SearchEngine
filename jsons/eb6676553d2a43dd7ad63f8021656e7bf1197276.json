This manuscript aimed to provide brief guidance for respiratory management of COVID-19 patients before, during, and after mechanical ventilation, based on the recent literature and on our direct experience with this population. We identify that chest CT patterns in COVID-19 may be divided into three main phenotypes: 1) multiple, focal, possibly overperfused ground-glass opacities; 2) inhomogeneously distributed atelectasis; and 3) a patchy, ARDS-like pattern. Each phenotype can benefit from different treatments and ventilator settings. Also, peripheral macro-and microemboli are common, and attention should be paid to the risk of pulmonary embolism. We suggest use of personalized mechanical ventilation strategies based on respiratory mechanics and chest CT patterns. Further research is warranted to confirm our hypothesis. . Within few weeks, outbreaks of so-called 2019 novel coronavirus (nCoV) infection had spread worldwide. On February 11, 2020, the World Health Organization announced coronavirus disease 2019 as the name of this new disease, and exactly one month later, declared the situation a pandemic [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] . As of April J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 6 2020, the pandemic is ongoing in the majority of countries [1, 11] . Data from China suggest that 40% of patients who require intensive care unit (ICU) admission share similar comorbidities, such as diabetes and preexisting heart disease .",

However, a small proportion of patients will experience critical illness, with many of these requiring mechanical ventilation . In one study conducted in Wuhan, 41.8% of patients hospitalized for COVID-19 develop acute respiratory failure, with a fatality rate of 52.4% . The median time from symptom onset to respiratory failure was 8 days . At ICU admission, most COVID-19 patients present acute onset of hypoxemic respiratory failure, with oxygen saturation (SpO2) levels below 93% . Risk factors associated with respiratory failure and death include older age, neutrophilia, coagulation dysfunction, organ failure, and elevated D-dimer .",

CT imaging demonstrates five stages according to the time since onset and disease progression: 1) Very early stage (asymptomatic, positive nasopharyngeal swab): single, double, or scattered focal ground-glass opacity, nodules located in central lobule surrounded by patchy ground-glass opacities, patchy consolidation and air bronchogram sign; 2) Early phase: Monitoring of chest CT features is of extreme importance in these patients to personalize treatment strategies and mechanical ventilator settings (Fig. 1) . In particular, chest CT scan can help in the assessment of areas of atelectasis or overperfusion and shunting, as well as evaluation of the risk of pulmonary embolism. We have identified three main chest CT patterns in COVID-19 patients, representing three different phenotypes: 1) multiple, focal, possibly overperfused ground-glass opacities mainly in the subpleural region; 2) inhomogeneously distributed atelectasis and peribronchial opacities; and 3) a patchy ARDS-like pattern. These differing phenotypes are attributable to different pathophysiological mechanisms, and therefore require different ventilatory strategies; however, the phenotypes we propose seem to be in agreement with Gattinoni et al. (Gattinoni et al., 2020a) (Gattinoni et al., 2020b) , who proposed a phenotype L (low elastance, low ventilation to perfusion ratio, and low lung reclutability) compatible with our phenotype 1, a phenotype H (high elastance, and simil ARDS pattern), compatible with our phenotype 3, and a transitioning phenotype, which reflects the evolution of the disease.",

            "text": "Few data are available on the efficacy of noninvasive support-which includes continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), noninvasive ventilation (NIV), and high flow nasal oxygen (HFNO)-in COVID-19 pneumonia. In patients with influenza A(H1N1) infection, noninvasive positivepressure ventilation was associated with a high incidence of failure (57-85%), and patients who failed noninvasive support experienced a higher mortality rate than those treated with early J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f mechanical ventilation (Kumar et al., 2009)24] . The experience in COVID-19 patients from Wuhan was similar, with a high rate of noninvasive support failure and need for intubation and mechanical ventilation in 76% of cases; nevertheless, there was no difference in mortality between patients receiving noninvasive vs invasive ventilation . In general, noninvasive ventilatory management carries a high risk of generating negative (and unmeasured) intrathoracic pressures, and is thus potentially counterproductive (Brochard et al., 2017) . Noninvasive support also presents a higher risk of viral spread through mask leaks, with increased risk of transmission ( Fig. 2) . Furthermore, delayed intubation increases the risk of clinical deterioration and the need for emergency airway management. In general ICU patients, HFNO has been shown to decrease the need for tracheal intubation in acute hypoxemic respiratory failure when compared to conventional oxygen therapy, without impacting mortality (Rochwerg et al., 2019) . A randomized controlled trial comparing NIV and HFNO in patients with hypoxic respiratory failure showed that HFNO was able to reduce mortality at 90 days without affecting the need for intubation (50% vs 47%, p=0.18) (Frat et al., 2015) , while a meta-analysis comparing HFNO vs NIV demonstrated that HFNO is able to significantly decrease the need for intubation (Ni et al., 2018) . Therefore, in adults with COVID-19 and acute respiratory failure, HFNO should be preferred over NIV. Both NIV and HFNO are being used extensively in COVID-19 patients, especially in cases of milder disease or to buy time before invasive ventilation is commenced. However, the potential advantages of using NIV or HFNO in these circumstances have to be balanced against their risks. When a patient presents with severe respiratory failure or on a downward spiral that suggests intubation will be inevitable, noninvasive respiratory support should not be attempted [22] .",

Hypoxemic respiratory failure and need for invasive ventilation should be considered when patients receiving standard oxygen therapy exhibit tachypnea (> 30 bpm) and hypoxemia (SpO2 < 90% or partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) < 60 mmHg) with oxygen administered via a facemask and reservoir bag (gas flow of 10~15 L/min, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) 0.60-0.95). Similarly, when a patient under HFNO support with FiO2 >70% and gas flow >50 L/min or NIV experiences persistent respiratory failure or deteriorates acutely, mechanical ventilation should be promptly initiated . Fig. 3 presents our algorithm for trialing CPAP and indications for centralization and intubation of patients with COVID-19 respiratory failure. According to our experience, phenotype 1 is likely to be found when patients are promptly intubated and receive only brief or no noninvasive respiratory support. Patients who receive prolonged noninvasive ventilation are likely to develop phenotype 2 or 3, thus becoming more difficult to ventilate, with lower compliance and worse deterioration of oxygenation.",

A rapid difficult-airway assessment should be done to recognize those at risk for difficult airway management. Intubation should be performed by the most experienced clinician, with the help of another doctor, and the most familiar airway device should be the first choice for intubating (Zuo et al., 2020) . Preoxygenation with 100% FiO2 for 5 minutes before induction of anesthesia could be useful. Pre-oxygenation should be J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f performed, using a well-fitting occlusive face mask attached to a manual ventilation device with an oxygen source (Zuo et al., 2020) . A viral filter must be inserted between the facemask and manual ventilation device to minimize aerosolization. The viral filter should be applied directly to the face mask, since the greater the number of connections between the facemask and filter, the greater the risk of disconnection on the patient side and subsequent aerosolization of the virus (Zuo et al., 2020) . After intubation, if using a humidified ventilator circuit, the viral filter used for intubation will need to be removed promptly; if a dry circuit is used, a combined heat-moisture exchanger (HME) and viral filter can be left in place, but this means that nebulization cannot be administered without breaking the circuit (to place a nebulizer between the patient and the HME). If the viral filter has been removed, the ventilator should be placed on standby for all circuit disconnections. Each disconnection from the ventilator should occur with the tube clamped to minimize the risk of aerosolization. with relatively well-maintained lung mechanics (good compliance) but severe hypoxemia, which could be consequent to impaired lung perfusion. Moreover, chest CT patterns differ among patients and over time. As noted above, we have found that chest CT findings in COVID-19 fall into three different phenotypes, each warranting unique mechanical ventilation settings and management strategies, which should thus be individualized based on clinical and CT features (Fig. 1,   Additional File 1, Fig. S1 ).",

Moderate PEEP levels may therefore be able to redistribute pulmonary blood flow from damaged to non-damaged lung areas; however, higher PEEP levels can impair cardiac function, thus increasing the need for fluids and vasoconstrictor drugs without having important effects on oxygenation.

Patients can be eligible for a trial of extubation once they are well awake, J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f exhibit good cough reflexes, and have stable hemodynamic and ventilatory parameters. At this stage, a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) is performed before considering endotracheal tube removal. NIV and HFNO can be considered after extubation . Patients should ideally be non-infective prior to extubation, but this is likely to be unfeasible. When patients are still at risk of transmission, few recommendations are available to reduce the risk of infection; these include placement of a simple oxygen mask on the patient immediately after extubation to minimize aerosolization, the use of high PEEP levels, and avoidance of cough. If feasible, separate beds should be reserved for patients suitable for extubation trials (regardless of whether they are still positive for SARS-CoV-2) to reduce the risk of reagudization and, ultimately, reinfection of other patients.",

The literature suggests administration of rocuronium (>1.5 mg/kg ideal body weight) or suxamethonium (1.5 mg/kg total body weight) to obtain rapid onset of deep neuromuscular blockade and minimize the risk of the coughing during airway instrumentation[31]. Routine use of a videolaryngoscope is recommended for the first attempt at intubation to maximize the distance between the airway operator's face and the patient. The choice of videolaryngoscope should be made according to the skillset and clinical judgement of the airway operator(Brewster et al., 2020). In case of failed intubation, a second-generation laryngeal mask should be placed to guarantee tracheal intubation passage through the mask with the aid of a fiberscope(Zuo et al., 2020).",

            "text": "of management in respiratory failure is mechanical ventilation, always with the aim of minimizing ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) (Fan et al., 2018). Early in the outbreak, all patients with severe COVID-19 were considered to have ARDS and consequently ventilated with low tidal volumes-6 mL/kg of predicted body weight (PBW)-and plateau pressure, as well as high positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) (Fan et al., 2017). The Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guidelines on the Management of Critically Ill Adults with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (Alhazzani et al., 2020) recommend using low-tidal volume (VT) ventilation (VT 4-8 mL/kg of PBW) instead of higher tidal volumes (VT >8 mL/kg PBW). Additionally, a higher PEEP (>10 cm H2O) strategy should be preferred over a lower PEEP, and PEEP should be titrated according to FiO2 to maintain an appropriate SpO2 in order to reduce atelectasis and alveolar hyperinflation as well as pulmonary vascular resistance [23]. Even though COVID-19 patients fulfill the Berlin criteria for ARDS (The ARDS Definition Task Force et al., 2012), the clinical and chest CT features of mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients do not always resemble ARDS. In fact, these patients may present",
