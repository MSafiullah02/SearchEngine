Chief among these are the rotaviruses, which are the most common cause of viral gastroenteritis in human infants (Kapikian et al., 2001). Reoviruses infect the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts of virtually all mammals, including humans (Tyler, 2001). However, disease associated with reovirus infection occurs primarily in the very young (Tyler et al., 2004). Reoviruses are highly virulent in newborn mice, the preferred experimental system for studies of reovirus pathogenesis, and produce injury to a variety of host tissues, including the central nervous system (CNS), heart, and liver (Tyler, 2001).",

            "text": "Reoviruses contain a genome of 10 dsRNA gene segments enclosed in two concentric protein shells, termed outer capsid and core. Reovirus infection is initiated by viral attachment to host cells via the filamentous attachment protein \u03c31 (Furlong et al., 1988). The \u03c31 protein engages cell-surface carbohydrate (Chappell et al., 1997, Chappell et al., 2000) and junctional adhesion molecule-A (JAM-A) (Barton et al., 2001b, Campbell et al., 2005), an integral component of intercellular tight junctions (Martin-Padura et al., 1998). Following attachment to the cell surface, reovirus internalization is mediated by \u03b21 integrins (Maginnis et al., 2006), most likely via clathrin-dependent endocytosis (Ehrlich et al., 2004). In the endocytic compartment, viral outer-capsid proteins \u03c33 and \u03bc1/\u03bc1C are cleaved by acid-dependent cysteine proteases (Baer and Dermody, 1997, Ebert et al., 2002), resulting in generation of infectious subvirion particles (ISVPs) (Borsa et al., 1981). During ISVP formation, \u03c33 is removed and a hydrophobic conformer of \u03bc1/\u03bc1C is exposed, facilitating endosomal membrane penetration and delivery of transcriptionally active reovirus core particles into the cytoplasm (Chandran et al., 2002, Odegard et al., 2004), where the remainder of the replication cycle occurs.",

Despite extensive efforts in several laboratories, generation of an animal dsRNA virus entirely from cloned cDNAs has not been achieved. This critical technological gap is perhaps the single most important limitation to studies of these viruses. Previous efforts on reovirus and rotavirus reverse genetics have resulted in entirely RNA-based (Roner et al., 1997) or partially plasmid-based (Komoto et al., 2006) systems that permit replacement of one or two viral genes. These approaches have been used to rescue temperature-sensitive reovirus strains (Roner et al., 1997), define packaging signals in reovirus RNAs (Roner and Steele, 2007), and isolate rotaviruses containing engineered changes in the viral attachment protein (Komoto et al., 2006). However, neither the reovirus nor rotavirus reverse genetics systems in their current configurations permit selective introduction and recovery of desired mutations in each viral gene segment.",

Point mutations introduced into viral capsid proteins \u03c31 and \u03c33 were used to define sequences that govern susceptibility to cleavage by intestinal proteases. We also recovered a recombinant virus that expresses green fluorescent protein (GFP) by replacement of the \u03c33 open reading frame (ORF) with GFP. The establishment of plasmid-based reverse genetics for reovirus will allow heretofore technically unapproachable problems in dsRNA virus biology to be studied, provide a platform for development of analogous marker rescue systems for other segmented dsRNA viruses, and foster exploration of reovirus as a vaccine vector to elicit protective immunity against a variety of mucosal pathogens.",

As all reovirus (+)-sense RNAs are terminated with a 5\u2032 guanosine (Furuichi et al., 1975a, Furuichi et al., 1975b), plasmid-generated transcripts are anticipated to possess native 5\u2032 ends (Roner and Joklik, 2001) (\nFigure 1A). Murine L929 fibroblast (L) cells, which efficiently support reovirus replication (Barton et al., 2001a), were infected with the attenuated, T7 RNA polymerase-expressing vaccinia virus strain rDIs-T7pol 1 hr prior to transfection with the ten reovirus cDNA plasmids (Figure 1B). Nascent transcripts were synthesized with the hepatitis delta virus (HDV) ribozyme fused to the 3\u2032 terminus, which is expected to generate a native 3\u2032 end upon autocatalytic removal (Roner and Joklik, 2001) (Figure 1A). Thus, this expression strategy should yield ten unique reovirus mRNA species competent to complete all steps in the viral RNA life cycle. Accordingly, rescued viruses were recovered from cell-culture supernatants by plaque assay on L cell monolayers (Figure 1C).",

At 24\u201348 hr posttransfection, times corresponding to the primary round of infection, eight or fewer infectious centers per 106 cells were detected (Figure 1D). The number of infectious centers increased substantially between 48 and 72 hr posttransfection to 18 to 90 per 106 cells, suggesting that a secondary round of infection had ensued by the 72 hr time point. Viral titer in transfection lysates was below the limit of detection (\u223c10 PFU/ml) at 24 hr but was detectable at 48 hr and increased logarithmically at time points thereafter (Figure 1C). The ratio of viral PFU in transfection lysates to infectious centers was \u223c10 to 100 at 48 and 72 hr. These results indicate that initiation of productive reovirus replication from transfected plasmids is inefficient, with approximately 1 cell per 105 to 106 cells giving rise to, on average, 10 to 100 viable virus particles that establish infection of the culture. In our experiments, yields of WT virus 5 days after plasmid transfection are regularly in the range of 104\u2013106 PFU/ml (Figure 1C).",

To confirm that viruses isolated using the plasmid-based rescue procedure contained the expected combination of gene segments, genomic dsRNA isolated from recombinant strain (rs) T3D and rsT3D/T1LS1 was resolved in SDS-polyacrylamide gels and visualized by ethidium bromide staining (\nFigure 2A). The electropherotype of rsT3D was indistinguishable from that of strain T3D, the origin of the cloned cDNA sequences used to generate rsT3D. Likewise, rsT3D/T1LS1 displayed an electropherotype consistent with nine cloned gene segments derived from T3D and a single cloned gene segment, S1, derived from strain T1L. To exclude the possibility of contamination, a silent point mutation, G to A at nucleotide 2205, was introduced into the L1 gene of all virus strains generated from cloned cDNAs (Figure 2B). This change has not been observed in any reported T3D L1 sequence (Wiener and Joklik, 1989) and serves as a signature for viruses derived through plasmid-based rescue. As anticipated, sequence analysis of rsT3D and rsT3D/T1LS1 revealed the expected G to A substitution (Figure 2C), confirming the plasmid origins of these isolates.",

Reovirus strain T3D forms large globular inclusions that localize to the perinuclear space (Parker et al., 2002). To determine whether rsT3D forms viral inclusions in a manner similar to native T3D, cells were infected with T3D and rsT3D and processed 18 hr postinfection for image analysis by confocal microscopy (\nFigure 3A). Both T3D and rsT3D formed morphologically indistinguishable large globular inclusions that were localized to the perinuclear compartment.

Purified virions of rsT3D and rsT3D-\u03c31T249I were treated with trypsin and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. As expected, a digestion pattern consistent with formation of ISVPs (loss of \u03c33 protein and generation of the \u03b4 fragment of \u03bc1C protein) was observed for both viruses (Figure 4B). However, the stability of rsT3D and rsT3D-\u03c31T249I \u03c31 proteins differed. The band corresponding to rsT3D \u03c31 diminished in intensity immediately after trypsin addition until it was eventually undetectable (Figure 4B). However, the rsT3D-\u03c31T249I \u03c31 band was intact even after 60 min of digestion. Thus, the T249I polymorphism is an independent determinant of \u03c31 cleavage susceptibility.",

As observed with WT T3D in previous experiments (Nibert et al., 1995), rsT3D lost infectious titer rapidly after protease treatment. In contrast, titers of rsT3D-\u03c31T249I remained relatively stable throughout the assay time course. Loss of infectivity of rsT3D correlated with kinetics of \u03c31 cleavage (compare Figures 4B and 4C), indicating that changes in viral infectivity after trypsin treatment are governed by the cleavage state of \u03c31. Furthermore, both phenotypes are linked to a single \u03c31 polymorphism at amino acid 249.",

Exposure of T3D to an intestinal wash results in \u03c31 cleavage (Chappell et al., 1998), raising the possibility that failure of T3D to infect the intestine is in part attributable to \u03c31 cleavage susceptibility. To test whether susceptibility of \u03c31 to proteolytic cleavage is associated with diminished T3D growth in animals, we assessed the capacity of rsT3D and rsT3D-\u03c31T249I to infect the intestine and disseminate systemically following PO inoculation (\nFigure 5A). Newborn mice were inoculated perorally with each strain, and viral titers in the intestine and brain were determined at 4, 8, and 12 days after inoculation. At all time points tested, titers of rsT3D-\u03c31T249I in the intestine were greater than those produced by rsT3D. Furthermore, rsT3D-\u03c31T249I produced greater titers in the brain at days 8 and 12 than did rsT3D. However, when inoculated by the intracranial (IC) route, rsT3D and rsT3D-\u03c31T249I produced equivalent titers (Figure 5B), although rsT3D reached peak titers at earlier time points than did rsT3D-\u03c31T249I.

Importantly, recombinant viruses are generated without a requirement for helper virus and free of any selection. Thus, this new technology provides a means to directly and precisely engineer the viral genome in the context of infectious virus.",

This difference in infectivity is hypothesized to be a direct result of \u03c31 cleavage (Nibert et al., 1995, Chappell et al., 1998), presumably due to removal of the JAM-A-binding region of the molecule. Although the T249I substitution in expressed T3D \u03c31 renders it resistant to cleavage by trypsin (Chappell et al., 1998), until now it has not been possible to define the role of \u03c31 cleavage in T3D infectivity for lack of means to generate a mutant T3D virus with the T249I change. This virus has been generated using reverse genetics, and our findings indicate that cleavage susceptibility of viral attachment protein \u03c31 due to a single polymorphism at amino acid position 249 is the basis for reduced infectivity of T3D ISVPs relative to virions (Figure 4C) and contributes to diminished growth of T3D in the murine intestine following PO inoculation (Figure 5A).",

A C-terminal Y354H mutation in \u03c33 protein of strain T3D was selected during persistent infection of L cells (PI viruses) (Wetzel et al., 1997) and by serial passage of virus in L cells treated with either E64 (D-EA viruses) (Ebert et al., 2001) or ammonium chloride (ACA-D viruses) (Clark et al., 2006). Using reovirus reverse genetics, the Y354H substitution was introduced into a WT T3D genetic background, and the resultant virus, rsT3D-\u03c33Y354H, demonstrated accelerated kinetics of \u03c33 cleavage (Figure 6B) and diminished sensitivity to the growth-inhibitory effects of E64 (Figure 6C). Residue 354 is located in a position thought to be important for controlling access to protease-hypersensitive regions in \u03c33, residues 208\u2013214 and 238\u2013242, thereby influencing \u03c33 cleavage kinetics (Jan\u00e9-Valbuena et al., 2002). Therefore, it appears that residue 354 in \u03c33 is a gatekeeper for the viral outer capsid, serving to regulate the balance between viral stability and an irreversible, proteolytically triggered disassembly cascade committing the virion particle to either replication or inactivation.",

These results reveal the potential for exploitation of reovirus as a gene-transduction vector with application in the development of new mucosal vaccines, more effective oncolytic agents (Coffey et al., 1998), and high-level expression of foreign genes in animal cells. Ideal reovirus vectors will contain stable \u03c31 proteins and combine excellent extracellular stability with highly efficient intracellular disassembly. We find that each of these parameters can be independently adjusted through strategic alterations in outer-capsid proteins. Manipulation of inner-capsid proteins and the genomic RNA itself should allow construction of viruses able to circumvent other aspects of virus-cell and virus-host interactions that pose potential barriers to antigen and gene delivery by reovirus.",

Thus, the reovirus plasmid-based marker rescue system is suited to the isolation of viable viral clones by plaque assay, followed by expansion in cell culture to attain quantities of virus sufficient for phenotypic analyses. Manipulations that severely cripple viral replication or particle assembly are more challenging to study because these changes may prohibit virus isolation. However, recovery of a GFP-expressing virus, rsT3D/S4-GFP, demonstrates that marker rescue of lethal mutations is possible by transcomplementation (in this case with WT \u03c33 protein) (Figure 7 and Figure S1). This result also agrees with our previous finding that inhibition of reovirus replication by RNAi-mediated reduction of viral protein synthesis is reversible by transcomplementation with ectopically expressed WT protein (Kobayashi et al., 2006). Furthermore, transcomplementation allows precise definition through systematic mutational analysis of functional domains in reovirus proteins that are essential for viral replication (Kobayashi et al., 2006). It should be possible to apply this technique to the new marker rescue system for delineation of structure-function relationships in reovirus proteins and RNA.",

To generate pT7-S4GFP, S4 nucleotide sequences 150\u2013768 within pT7-S4T3D were replaced with the GFP ORF. Nucleotide sequences of recombinant plasmids were confirmed by DNA sequencing.

The medium was removed, cells were adsorbed with virus for 1 hr, and fresh medium with or without E64 was added. After 24 hr incubation, viral titers in cell lysates were determined by plaque assay. The results are presented as the mean viral yields, calculated by dividing titer at 24 hr by titer at 0 hr for each concentration of E64, for triplicate experiments. Error bars indicate SD.",
