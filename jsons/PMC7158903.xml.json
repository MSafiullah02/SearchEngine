We identified a group of approved drugs that could inhibit clathrin-mediated endocytosis and thereby inhibit viral infection of cells (appendix). The drug targets are members of the numb-associated kinase (NAK) family\u2014including AAK1 and GAK\u2014the inhibition of which has been shown to reduce viral infection in vitro.5, 6 Baricitinib was identified as a NAK inhibitor, with a particularly high affinity for AAK1, a pivotal regulator of clathrin-mediated endocytosis. We suggested that this drug could be of use in countering SARS-CoV-2 infections, subject to appropriate clinical testing.",

Such drugs are predicted to be of particular importance in the treatment of severe cases of COVID-19, when the host inflammatory response becomes a major cause of lung damage and subsequent mortality. Comparison of the properties of the three best candidates are shown in the table\n. Baricitinib, fedratinib, and ruxolitinib are potent and selective JAK inhibitors approved for indications such as rheumatoid arthritis and myelofibrosis. All three are powerful anti-inflammatories that, as JAK\u2013STAT signalling inhibitors, are likely to be effective against the consequences of the elevated levels of cytokines (including interferon-\u03b3) typically observed in people with COVID-19\u00b72 Although the three candidates have similar JAK inhibitor potencies, a high affinity for AAK1 suggests baricitinib is the best of the group, especially given its once-daily oral dosing and acceptable side-effect profile.7 The most significant side-effect seen over 4214 patient-years in the clinical trial programmes used for European Medicines Agency registration was a small increase in upper respiratory tract infections (similar to that observed with methotrexate), but the incidence of serious infections (eg, herpes zoster) over 52 weeks' dosing was small (3\u00b72 per 100 patient-years), and similar to placebo.7 Use of this agent in patients with COVID-19 over 7\u201314 days, for example, suggests side-effects would be trivial.",

Our analysis of the closely related JAK inhibitors ruxolitinib and fedratinib (table) illustrates that the predicted unbound plasma exposure required to inhibit the enzymes needed for clathrin-mediated endocytosis greatly exceeds the currently tolerated exposures used therapeutically. These drugs are, therefore, unlikely to reduce viral infectivity at tolerated doses, although they might reduce the host inflammatory response through JAK inhibition. Intriguingly, another JAK inhibitor, tofacitinib, shows no detectable inhibition of AAK1. The high affinity of baricitinib for NAKs, its anti-inflammatory properties, and its ability to ameliorate associated chronic inflammation in interferonopathies,8 together with its advantageous pharmacokinetic properties, appear to make it a special case among the approved drugs.",

Furthermore, there is the potential for combining baricitinib with the direct-acting antivirals (lopinavir or ritonavir and remdesivir) currently being used in the COVID-19 outbreak, since it has a minimal interaction with the relevant CYP drug-metabolising enzymes. Combinations of baricitinib with these direct-acting antivirals could reduce viral infectivity, viral replication, and the aberrant host inflammatory response.
