            "text": "Digital technology is widely used for educational purposes. In this scenario a salient duty of a teacher is to assist in the transfer of knowledge to students in a meaningful and understandable manner [1]. To aid this role, teachers use their proficiency to choose and use teaching materials such as lecture notes, textbooks, multimedia tools etc. [2], while learners are expected to engage with these study materials. Teachers often employ specific strategies to create and transfer knowledge, and one such technique is visualization [3, 4]. Visualization involves the use of images to transfer data, information or knowledge [5, 6]. These are often created by teachers, educational, learning and instructional designers for teaching and learning [7], with minimal or negligible contribution from learners. According to Bada [8], it benefits learners to be co-creators of their learning experience. Actively involving students in knowledge visualization (KV) is one way of compelling them to engage with learning material and to achieve knowledge transfer (KT). In addition, producing KV allows learners to demonstrate their knowledge acquisition. The problem is a lack of knowledge visualization guidelines and standards in the extant literature, this hampers evidence-based implementation of knowledge visualization initiatives.",

For this paper, the investigation focuses on learners\u2019 experience of KT while applying the usability-based knowledge visualization guidelines in creating images to demonstrate their knowledge acquisition, as well as the effect on the images created by learners when they apply the usability-based knowledge visualization guidelines. To investigate learners\u2019 experience of KT via the use of usability-based knowledge visualization guidelines, a group of science learners in high school were asked to create visual diagrams to illustrate the rocket launch phase. Usability-based knowledge visualization guidelines was introduced to learners after which the initial images created by learners were revised to meet these guidelines. The exercise aims to investigate the impact of each guideline on the images created by the learners when using the guidelines to improve their knowledge representation to demonstrate their knowledge acquisition and transfer. The remainder of the paper gives an overview on: what KV entails; KT; how Human Computer Interaction (HCI) usability guidelines was used to inform KV principles, culminating in the usability-based knowledge visualization guidelines artefacts developed for this study; and the effect of usability-based knowledge visualization guidelines on images produced by learners as well as learners experience of KT through KV.",

Van Biljon and Renaud noted that the primary aim of KV is knowledge transfer in contrast to information visualization which aims to support pattern identification [7].
