Thus, a better understanding of the current situation of PA and SB during this pandemic among children and adolescents could help teachers, parents, and the Ministry of Education to urgently determine and implement effective policies and interventions for children and adolescents. However, till date, no study J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f examined this issue. Therefore, we probed this aspect in detail during this critical time.",

            "text": "from 13 to 23 March 2020 (during the pandemic). In total, 2427 children and adolescents participated in the two surveys. Moderate-and vigorous-intensity PA was measured based on Global Physical Activity Questionnaire (GPAQ) developed by the World Health Organization. PA was calculated as weekly minutes of moderate-intensity PA plus twice the reported minutes of vigorous-intensity PA and was defined as inactive (<30 min/day), insufficiently active (\u226530, <60 min/day), and sufficiently active (\u226560 min/day) according to the guidelines for children. We calculated total screen time, a major indicator of SB, by summing the screen time during leisure (watching TV/videos [DVD, video app, etc], internet use [news, douban, etc], computer/smartphone games and social platform use [QQ, WeChat, etc]), school lessons, homework and reading/studying online or on a smartphone. Leisure-time screen time was further categorized as short (\u2264 2 h /day) and long (>2 h/day). Analyses were conducted using SPSS version 25. We analyzed data from 2426 children and adolescents (boys, 51.2%; girls, 48.8%) with valid data on PA and SB. Overall, the median time spent in PA decreased drastically, from 540 min/week (before the pandemic) to 105 min/week (during the pandemic), yielding 435 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f min reduction on average. Of note, during the pandemic, prevalence of physically inactive students extensively increased from 21.3% to 65.6%. Screen time considerably increased during the pandemic in total (+1730 min [or approximately 30 hours] per week on average). Screen time during leisure was also prolonged, indicating that nearly a quarter of students engaged in long screen time for leisure. These data revealed a substantial decrease in PA and increase in screen time during the COVID-19 pandemic. The new coronavirus is still spreading globally, which may have the lasting impact on PA patterns and sedentary time, 8 posing severe challenges for children and adolescents as well. The reduced PA and prolonged SB may negatively impact children's and adolescents' physical and mental health, and in turn, such worsened health conditions would further reduce PA level and prolong SB. Such a vicious circle should thus be broken.",
