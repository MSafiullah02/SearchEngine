We have abbreviated the factor by P/E since it is really a PE (Price/Earnings Ratio). The product of P/E and Earnings equates to the price of a company. The numbers in the P/E factor according to Graham derive simply from the assumption that a fair P/E of a company of zero growth is 8.5 and a company with a 2% growth should have a P/E of 12.5.",

Here we model the earnings off 4/9 the past earnings history, current year and next year earnings forecasts. We simply linearly interpolate 5 years ahead using a least-squares method. There are several ways one can do this and improve this method, using a longer time history or any other more sophisticated time series modelling technique [33] . For now, we just linearly interpolate the earnings to 5 years out. That Benjamin Graham found zero growth companies to have a P/E floor of 8.5 is not so farfetched. If we look at companies with near zero growth, we will see a P/E around 10. It won't be 8.5 necessarily but it is quite close to Benjamin's level. It is most likely related to the size of earnings and the dividend it pays out, in the end the price you pay for a stock in terms of earnings means that after 10 years the company will have earned as much as its current stock price is worth. If it pays out all these earnings as dividends it means after 10 years you have all your money back (pre-tax). The P/E won't go much lower because 1) a P/E of 0 would mean the stock price is zero or 2) a P/E of 1 would mean the stock is worth as much as its earnings. Both rather unlikely normally. The P/E of 8.5 represents the opportunity of earning above risk-free rates plus extra for any possible growth in the future.",

So you see an estimate even given exact figures in the past is not exact, yet no one would have priced in an annual growth of 101%.

It doesn't make sense to average across all names equally to get a representative figure. These averages are weighted according to their current market capitalization; i.e. smaller possibly more aggressive growth companies have less weight than big possibly more conservative growth companies. 8/9",
