There is no dosage recommendation of CD in COVID-19 children so far. Acute poisoning of CD is usually fatal with a dose of 50 mg/kg according to the instruction. A report regarded chloroquine concentration > 25 \u03bcmol/L as a fatal predictor [25] . Extreme caution should be followed while prescribing CD for children. CD should be used with caution in patients with heart diseases, liver or kidney dysfunction, hematoporphyria, mental illness. There are mild adverse reactions of CD in treating malaria, including dizziness, headache, loss of appetite, etc. [26] . At higher doses of CD, the main adverse reaction is ocular toxicity, which could affect vision. If eye discomfort or visual abnormality occurs, CD should be discontinued. Other adverse reactions of CD include arrhythmia, druginduced psychosis, leukopenia, etc. CD is mainly metabolized by liver and the burden of liver could be aggravated while combining with the other drugs (e.g., chlorpromazine) metabolized by liver. CD has a direct inhibitory effect on neuromuscular junctions, which could be aggravated while combining with drugs (e.g., clindamycin, streptomycin, gentamicin, etc.). Combination of CD with heparin could increase bleeding risk. For the patients with digitalization, CD could cause cardiac block. Other drug interactions (with indomethacin, thyroxine, isoniazid, etc.) also need to be noted.",

The dosage regimen of arbidol (0.2 g every time, twice daily, not be given over 10 days) in adults with COVID-19 was recommended [1] . There is no recommendation of dosage regimen of arbidol in children with COVID-19 so far.",
