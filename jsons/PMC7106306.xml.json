PED is characterized by watery diarrhea, dehydration and weight loss in adult and lethal in piglets (Debouck and Pensaert, 1980; Pijpers et al., 1993). Since the first report in England in the 1970s (Choudhury et al., 2016; Pensaert and Martelli, 2016), PED has been reported in some countries (Pensaert et al., 1981; Takahashi et al., 1983). In the 1980s, PEDV was first identified in China (Sun et al., 2018). Until 2000, PEDV has been widely spread in 26 provinces in China, which made a largescale of economic losses in breeding industry. PED which is caused by variant PEDV, was re-emerged in China since October 2010 and caused devastating economic losses to the piggeries. The variant PEDV stains with five amino acids (aa) insertions at about 56\u201360 aa and one aa insertion at 141 aa of S protein comparing with CV777-based vaccines.",

It is spherical 80\u2013220 nm in diameter, with envelope. And it also has 20 nm rodlike fiber and a symmetrical spiral nucleocapsid. The approximately 28 kb genome is an infectious, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA, which 5\u2032 \u2192 3\u2032 is in the order of 5\u00b4UTR-Replicase-S-ORF3-E-M-N-3\u00b4 UTR (Chen et al., 2013). The transmembrane S glycoprotein takes an important part in virus binding, with receptors, fusing cells and neutralizing antibodies development (Lai et al., 2007; Lee et al., 2010). S protein is implicated in virulence, which was found out in the other studies that S protein can be variant readily while receiving immune pressure (Gerber et al., 2014). Classifying PEDV with S gene can help us to understand its evolution rule easier. Therefore, S protein is used to study the viral relationships between different areas. It is an effective tool in PED epidemiologic investigations, also as diagnostic identification to distinguish between wild strain and cells accommodation attenuated strain (Park et al., 2011). In this study, PEDV CH/JLDH/2016 variant strain was isolated and identified, phylogenetic relationship between domestic and globally emerging PEDV isolates were also studied. The results would be helpful to find out the reason of the continuously outbreaks of PEDV in China and provide more information about the origin, evolution and diversity of PEDVs. Based on these newly identified PEDV variants, the novel vaccines may contribute to the control of PED outbreaks.",

Piglets in control group were mock infected with 3 mL of DMEM. All virus inoculation was done via the oculonasal route. After inoculation, all pigs were monitored daily for clinical signs of disease, including diarrhea and vomiting. At necropsy, intestinal tissues and contents were grossly tested.

While sharing the same branch with the recent epidemic strains, the CH/JLDH/2016 strain has a close relative with them. The reason PED still epidemically outbreaks in the immune pigs may be the differences between recent epidemic strains and earlier epidemic vaccine strains. Comparing to vaccine strain CV777, there are 15 nucleotides insertions and 9 deletions in the S gene of our strain which of a massive amout of bases variant, 3 epitopes (527-559aa, 604-645aa, 677-734aa) induced by neutralizing antibody were in S1 section. As a study suggests that the SS2 epitope (748SNIGVCK755) in S1 region of classic strains and variant strains is highly conservative rather amino acids mutate in SS6 epitope (764QDGQVKI771) and porcine aminopeptidase N (pAPN) receptor binding domain (490~615aa) (Wang et al., 2016b). Our strain, in the SS2 epitope have no amino acid, variant while in SS6 epitope, Y changed into S in 776th amino acid, which have a homogeneity in the changes of amino acid of variant strain that reference presents. The epitope existence in conservative region and 7 amino acid mutants in pAPN receptor binding domain (aa490-615) in our strain that possesses the concordant result with CV777 vaccine in providing part of crossing immune protection for some epidemic PEDV strains in China. The changes of amino acids in the antigenic epitope may change the immunogenicity of the virus, which is in line with previous studies (Lin et al., 2016). Based on these finding, we speculated that variant subtype G 2b PEDV may be circulating in pig herds of Northeast China.",

The attenuated CV777 strain belongs to the G1b subgroup, which is not genetically closely related with our variant strain. The CV777 vaccine strain failed to provide sufficient protection against the PEDV variants due to limited cross-protection, all of which have been reported in other studies (Li et al., 2012; Sun et al., 2012; Vlasova et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2013, Wang et al., 2014, Wang et al., 2016a). While the inactivated antigen produced by the YC2014 strain could provide immune protection for piglets (Lin et al., 2016), which can infer that the potential reason PED outbroke in some immune piggery are that bases inserted and deleted in S gene and the changes of neutralizing epitope amino acids. Our variants were different from G1 group PEDVs, which helps to explain why the CV777 vaccine strain could not provide sufficient protection against the PED outbreaks in some pig farms nowadays. It is contributed to understand the mutated circumstances of prevalent strain in order to provide reference material of PED preventive treatment.",
