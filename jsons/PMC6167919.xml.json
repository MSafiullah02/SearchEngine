            "text": "Cytomegalovirus (CMV) species are widespread among mammals, establishing life-long\ninfections in their specific host. Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) has a linear dsDNA genome of\napproximately 235 kb encoding at least 165 canonical ORFs (Dolan et al. 2004), plus many alternative transcripts and\npervasive translation outside these annotated ORFs revealed by recent expression analyses\n(Murphy et al. 2003; Stern-Ginossar et al. 2012). The genome of HCMV consists of two\ndomains (L and S), each comprising a unique region (UL and US) flanked\nby an inverted repeat sequence (TRL and IRL, TRS and\nIRS), yielding the genome configuration\nTRL\u2013UL\u2013IRL\u2013IRS\u2013US\u2013TRS.\nWhile primary infection of healthy individuals is common but usually asymptomatic, HCMV\ninfections of severely immune-suppressed individuals (e.g. HIV-infected and transplant\npatients) cause significant morbidity and mortality (Rubin 1989; Snydman 1990; Krause et al. 2013; Manicklal et al. 2013). Additionally, trans-placental\ntransmissions of HCMV are the commonest viral cause of severe birth defects in infants\n(Ross et al. 2006). These problems are\ncompounded by growing antiviral resistance and the lack of an effective vaccine (Krause et al. 2013) and there remains an unmet\nneed for data on viral diversity and HCMV evolution to facilitate the development of new\nintervention strategies to prevent and/or counteract HCMV pathology. Very recently, the high\nfrequency of recombination at the genome-wide level has been observed (Sijmons et al. 2015). This sheds new light on the understanding of\nHCMV evolution, in particular regarding recent studies where rapid fixation of novel point\nmutations was thought to be the main mechanism for intra-host diversification (Renzette et al. 2011; Renzette et al. 2013). However, estimation of the local\nrecombination intensity along the genome is subject to biases when other evolutionary\nfactors vary, and methodological issues may account for some patterns reported by Sijmons et al. (2015).",

We used a diverse dataset of genomes recovered from unrelated\nclinical samples collected in the UK, the Netherlands, Germany, Belgium, Italy, the USA and\nSouth Korea for which whole genome sequences were previously published (Bradley et al. 2009; Cunningham et al. 2010; Dargan et al. 2010; Jung et al.\n2011; Sijmons et al. 2014; Sijmons et al. 2015), in addition to 16 new HCMV\ngenomes sequences obtained directly from clinical samples. Our results confirm that\nextensive recombination affects HCMV genomes to the extent that the majority of sites in the\ngenome are unlinked. In addition, we show that there are exceptions to this pattern of free\nrecombination within several loci that are deeply divergent between strains and in high\nlinkage disequilibrium (LD). The largest of these linked hypervariable loci spans the RL11\nregion, which encodes glycoproteins with multiple functions related to immunity and tropism.\nThe rapid evolution of this locus, both within HCMV and between primate CMV species,\nsuggests an important role for these genes in CMV genome adaptation to their host. Taken\ntogether, these patterns support the idea of homologous recombination being a major force in\nthe evolution of HCMV.",

The sample\ncollection included two sets of paired samples (whole blood and bile/whole blood and a\nsolid tissue biopsy) from different body compartments and three sets of longitudinally\ncollected samples from either whole blood or plasma (Table 1). DNA was extracted using the QIAamp DNA Mini Kit\n(QIAGEN) according to the instructions of the manufacturer and quality assured using the\nQubit and Tapestation systems. Viral loads were determined for each sample using a\ndiagnostic qPCR assay as follows. A 15 \u00b5L mastermix (12.5 \u00b5L of QuantiFast Multiplex\nPCR +R and 2.5 \u00b5L of Primer/Probe mix) was combined with 10 \u00b5L of extracted DNA. Initial\ndenaturation was at 95 \u00b0C for 5 min followed by 45 cycles of denaturation (95 \u00b0C for 30 s)\nand annealing/extension (60 \u00b0C for 30 s). Forward (GCATGCGC GAGTGTCAAGAC) and reverse\n(GTTACTTT GAGCGCCATCTGT TCCT) primers were used at a final reaction concentration of\n0.6 pmol/\u00b5L while the probe (TGCGCCGTATGCTGCTCGACA, reporter = JOE, quencher = BHQ1) was\nused at a final concentration of 0.4 pmol/\u00b5L. All reactions were run in triplicate on an\nApplied Biosystems 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR System using six standards ranging from 500\ncopies/mL to 20,000,000 copies/mL. ",

Both actions were performed using\nin-house PERL scripts developed by the PATHSEEK consortium. The specificity of the baits\nwas verified by BLASTn searches against the Human Genomic + Transcript database. The\ncustom designed HCMV bait library was uploaded to SureDesign and synthesized by Agilent\nTechnologies (San Diego, USA). Following library preparation and enrichment for HCMV DNA\nby hybridization using the SureSelect XT v1.5 protocol (200 ng starting material),\nmodified only to increase the post-hybridization PCR yield where viral loads were low,\ndeep sequencing using an Illumina MiSeq (500 bp v2 kits) was performed yielding millions\nof 2\u00d7250 bp paired-end reads. Paired-end reads were trimmed and mapped by local assembly\nagainst a database of all full or partially sequenced HCMV genomes available in GenBank.\nSeveral isolates of HCMV have been previously sequenced for their whole genome and the\npresence of hypervariable regions within the HCMV genome are well documented (Lurain et al. 1999; Rasmussen et al. 2002; Garrigue et al. 2007; Bradley et al.\n2009), which led us to use a de novo approach to read assembly\n(Cunningham et al. 2010). Thus, all HCMV\nmapping read pairs were extracted and assembled into two de novo contigs\nforming the UL and US sequences. Accurate assembly of the repeated\nregions (TRL, IRL, IRS, and TRS) could not be\nperformed with short read data while insufficient material was available to obtain this\nsequence by other methods. A positive correlation was observed between the input viral\nload and the percentage of HCMV mapping reads (On Target Reads percent (OTR percent)),\nwhich was maintained until saturation i.e. the point at which the number of unique RNA\nbaits is less than the total number of HCMV genome copies present in the hybridization\nreactions.",

LD scans were performed using in-house R scripts making use\nof the 'ape' package (Paradis et al. 2004;\nPopescu et al. 2012). Significance of LD\nwas tested using Fisher's exact test on the 2\u00d72 contingency table of counts of possible\nallele pairs. First, we searched the all-versus-all biallelic site matrix for\nsignificant associations at P < 0.05, using the Bonferroni\ncorrection for multiple testing. Then, to detect short domains resilient to\nrecombination, a sliding window scan was conducted to detect local peaks of LD (windows\nof 20 bi-allelic sites with a sliding step of 5 sites). The \u2212log10 transform of Fisher's\ntest P values [\u2212log10(PLDFisher)] from a\nwindow were compared to the distribution of\n\u2212log10(PLDFisher) for the genome-wide set of comparisons\nmade in this range (i.e. within the diagonal ribbon of the square matrix of\nall-versus-all sites LD tests, sampled with a quantile function to get a representative\nsample of the same size than the window's) using a Mann\u2013Whitney\u2013Wilcoxon U test\n(single-tailed test with alternative hypothesis of local LD greater than the\nbackground). The reported local LD index is defined as \u2212log\n10(PWilcox), with PWilcox the\nP value of the Mann\u2013Whitney\u2013Wilcoxon U test. Using windows of 20\nsuccessive bi-allelic sites spreading over variable physical distances (window sizes\nranged from 24 bp to 3,376 bp), we observed that the density of bi-allelic SNPs was\nstrongly correlated to the power of the test (Pearson's correlation,\nr = 0.56,\nP < 10\u221216). Because the physical spacing of\nsites impacts directly the expected linkage between them, we modified the scan so that\nbi-allelic SNP density is constant and cannot bias our measure of LD: we used windows of\nfixed physical size in which a constant number of 20 bi-allelic sites were sub-sampled\nso that their spacing is the closest possible to uniformity. We chose a window size of\n700 bp as a trade-off between resolution and coverage of the genome (95 percent of\nwindows encompassed at least 20 sites) (Supplementary Fig. S2).",

We\ngenerated synthetic genomes where nucleotidic diversity is homogeneous, but population\nstructure and recombination rate varies among loci. On one hand, 21 background loci of\n\u223c500 bp were simulated following trees that have no strong clonal structure and\nunderwent homologous recombination during evolution, with different histories of\northologous replacement events in each of their five \u223c100-bp partitions; this yielded a\nbackground of mosaic phylogenetic history marked by recombination (expected to induce\nstrong homoplasy signatures). On the other hand, three interspersed foreground loci of\nsize \u223c500 bp were simulated following trees that show strong clonal structure (i.e.\ntight clusters of strains at the tip of long internal branches, expected to induce\nstrong LD patterns) and did not undergo recombination during evolution. The resulting\nsimulated genomes of size \u223c12,000 bp thus meet the conditions for local LD test to be\napplied \u2013 searching for relatively rare local hotspots of high LD in a background of\nlittle or no LD \u2013 without the confounding effect of covarying nucleotidic diversity. To\nensure that the simulation conditions were the closest to the real conditions of our\nHCMV dataset, gene trees from the 42-genome HCMV dataset were used as guides to the\nsimulation, yielding alignments reflecting population structure that vary in a way\ncomparable to the HCMV dataset. All loci evolved under the same evolution model\n(CodonPAM) with trees of similar sizes, producing a homogeneously distributed range of\nnucleotidic diversity values (ranging 0.07\u20130.23), allowing us to see the potential\ncovariation of factors under a range of parameter combinations (low/strong diversity\nwith low/strong population structure).

To identify these regions,\nwe used GARD (Kosakovsky Pond et al. 2006)\nto screen the alignment of each annotated gene for the presence of segments of sequence\nshowing incongruent phylogenetic signals due to recombination; in the presence of\nrecombination breakpoints, the gene alignment was split into sub-alignments carrying\nstatistically uniform phylogenetic signal.

Gene sequences were\nclassified into genotypes using an algorithm for dynamic pruning of gene trees from the\n142-genome dataset (see Material and methods section), and these categories were used to\nidentify genome-wide correlation of genotype distribution among strains, yielding a metric\nanalogous to LD. The majority of genes showed no significant association with genes other\nthan their immediate neighbor (Fig. 1A). The\nmost striking exception to his trend is the cluster of 13 genes (RL10 to\nUL11, included in the structured RL10\u2013UL13 region reported above) in\nsubstantially higher LD, consistent with locally reduced recombination (Fig. 1B). The average linkage between direct\nneighbour genes in this region is r2 = 0.45, and\nthe most distal genes in the locus, RL10 and UL11, are 9 kb apart and yet are in tighter\nlinkage (r2 = 0.34) than the average for pairs of\ndirect neighbor genes elsewhere in the genome\n(r2 = 0.18). This region includes multiple genes\nfrom the RL11 family and is hereafter referred to as the RL11 region. A comparative\nsimilarity analysis of the HCMV proteomes demonstrates substantial variation in this\nregion (across the protein-coding loci in the region, the most divergent pairwise strain\ncomparisons range from 30 percent to 70 percent protein identity) (Fig. 2A). Moreover, when extending this comparison to include all\nprimate CMV and murine CMV species, this region consistently retains the highest genetic\nvariability (Fig. 2B). A second gene cluster\nof 11 genes (UL87\u2013UL97) also shows a significant degree\nof LD (Fig. 1C), although to a lesser extent\n(average linkage between direct neighbours,\nr2 = 0.23). To verify that these results do not\nonly stem from the clonal relationships between a few related strains in the dataset, we\nsplit the dataset into two subsets, the first comprising the 42 worldwide genomes and the\nsecond the 100 genomes from Sijmons et al.\n(2015), which were collected on a more restricted geographic and temporal scale\n(Supplementary Fig. S9). In\nboth cases, we robustly recovered the high linkage of RL11 region.

            "text": "Homologous recombination is likely to be restricted between highly differentiated\ngenotypes due to the inability of homologous strands to anneal, favoring further\ndivergence. Their primary divergence may, however, have been driven by positive selective\npressure, i.e. selection for changes in the resultant protein. To test this hypothesis, we\nscanned all HCMV gene trees using the aBSREL algorithm (Kosakovsky Pond et al. 2011; Smith et al. 2015) and show that the genomes evolved mostly\nunder purifying selection, with an average dN/dS of 0.18\nover their complete evolutionary history (branch length-weighted average of mean\ndN/dS values for all branches pooled across all\ngenes). This constraint on the diversification of encoded proteins is also seen within\nhyper-variable genes (average dN/dS of 0.22) but to a\nlesser extent than in other genes (average dN/dS of\n0.17, t-test P value < 0.003) (Supplementary Fig. S3). However,\nthis analysis also pointed to evidence for episodes of positive selection (branches with\nsignificantly non-null proportion of sites with\ndN/dS > 1) in 29 genes (Fig. 3, track 4 and Supplementary Table S2), nine of which have also been identified as\nhyper-variable (Supplementary Table\nS4 and Supplementary File\nS5) and hotspots of LD (Table 2).\nThere is a significant enrichment of positively selected genes in hyper-variable\nnon-recombining genes (Chi-squared test, df = 1,\nP < 0.003). It should be noted that this test is conservative given\nthe greater possibility of spurious inference of episodes of positive selection in\nrecombining genes by the phylogenetic selection scan. Indeed, when using an alternative\nmethod based on pairwise sequence comparisons that does not make assumptions about the\nphylogenetic history of samples (Yang and Nielsen\n2000), we generally fail to detect positive selection in recombining genes (data\nnot shown). Closer examination of the nine positively selected hyper-variable genes\nidentified episodes of positive selection in the deep branches separating the diverged\ngenotypes as well as on terminal branches (Supplementary File S5), in contrast with purifying selection occurring\nin the rest of branches (Supplementary\nTable S2). This supports a scenario of recurrent episodes of positive selection\nthroughout the evolution of these genes rapidly generating sequence diversity, driving\nthese loci to gradually diverge into almost non-homologous genotypes.",

            "text": "Using a series of phylogenetic and population genetics analyses, we characterized\nrecombination in HCMV genomes at increasing resolution and show recombination to be so\npervasive across most of the genome that virtually every variable site segregates\nindependently. In this respect, this viral species can be considered to behave as a single\nfreely recombining worldwide population. This observation is in line with the absence of\nany apparent geographical or epidemiological structure in the HCMV population at the\ngenome-wide level (Supplementary Figs.\nS5 and S6), as has previously been reported for individual gene markers (Haberland et al. 1999; Pignatelli et al. 2004; Bradley et al. 2008). Recombination of sub-genomic fragments has previously been\nobserved for Epstein\u2013Barr virus and also genome-wide for herpes simplex virus 1&2,\nVZV, and murine CMV (Walling et al. 1994;\nLingen et al. 1997; Norberg et al. 2007; Norberg et al. 2011; Norberg et al\n2015; Smith et al. 2013), and thus\nappears to be a hallmark of many herpesviruses. Recombination is indeed known to be a\ncrucial step of the replication process in HSV-1 (Wilkinson and Weller 2003) and has been postulated to occur between\nsuperinfecting as well as reactivating genomes in HCMV (Chou 1989; Haberland et\nal. 1999; Steininger et al. 2005;\nGarrigue et al. 2007; Steininger 2007; Faure-Della Corte et al. 2010). The topology of long haplotypes\nobserved between pairs of strains is suggestive of recombination occurring through large\nreplacement events, for example, by crossing-over or joining replicated genome segments\n(Wilkinson and Weller 2003) rather than by\nlocalized gene conversion events. The recent study from Sijmons et al. (2015) also reported the occurrence of intense,\ngenome-wide homologous recombination in HCMV genomes and similarly stressed the\nheterogeneity of the recombination intensity across the genome. However, the map of the\nrecombination landscape resulting from their analysis differs markedly from ours. Using\nrecombination breakpoint detection methods, they showed a globally higher prevalence of\nrecombination in genes with higher diversity (Sijmons et al. 2015). These breakpoint methods are appropriate to identify\npartitions of sequence alignments with different phylogenetic history (Kosakovsky Pond et al. 2006) in order to treat\nthem separately in downstream analyses \u2013 as we did ourselves for our gene-scale analyses.\nHowever, recombination breakpoints are generically identified from the conflicting\nphylogenetic signals estimated over their flanking segments of sequence. Breakpoint\ndetection methods thus can only report a finite number of recombination events per locus,\nwhich are biased towards the most obvious, i.e. recent events. This limited account of\nrecombination history thus leads to a biased estimate of recombination intensities. In\naddition, methods like GARD (Kosakovsky Pond et al.\n2006), which involve the reconstruction and comparison of phylogenetic trees, can\nbe afflicted by high rates of false positives in the face of strong evolutionary rate\nvariation across a gene sequence; a situation often met in genes with hyper-variable\ndomains but highly conserved otherwise (e.g. in UL55/gB). Finally, these methods, like all\npolymorphism-based analyses, are highly biased towards the detection of more recombination\nbreakpoints in more variable genomic regions. Conversely, LD can be quantified at every\nvariable site and naturally integrates the effect of recombination over long evolutionary\ntimes. For all these reasons, we feel that the analysis of variation of recombination\nintensities within HCMV genomes is better addressed by the approach we deployed, which is\nbased on LD and was specially designed to control for heterogeneity in polymorphism\ndensity.",

            "text": "Within this genome-wide pattern of essentially free recombination and strong genome\nconservation, some 31 loci do not recombine freely (Fig. 3). Two-thirds of these genes have evolved multiple genotypes that are\nsufficiently divergent to prevent recombination between each other (Table 2). Considering the functional annotation of these genes,\nmost (24/31) of the high-LD genes are annotated as membrane glycoproteins that are either\nknown or predicted to be involved in virus entry or immune evasion (Table 2). In addition, 10/31 harbor T-cell epitopes (Fig. 3A, track 2; Table 2), as previously determined by a systematic experimental\nscan (Sylwester et al. 2005). Functions\nimplying protein\u2013 protein interaction with host factors and/or having antigenic status are\nsuggestive of co-evolutionary dynamics driving the diversification of these proteins. In\nnine of these genes, phylogenetic analysis revealed evidence of past and present positive\nselections, which likely accounts for this extreme divergence (Supplementary Tables S2 and S4). For\nthese nine positively selected hyper-variable genes, which include antigenic viral\nproteins like UL55/gB, this pattern is highly suggestive of selective pressure for escape\nof the host immune system driving sequence diversification. Causes of diversification of\nother hyper-variable proteins are less obvious, and may involve more complex scenarios.\nFor instance RL11 gene family members encode putative glycoproteins (both membrane and\ncytosolic, Gabaev et al. 2011) that can\nimpact virus growth in a cell type-specific manner, manipulate leukocyte adhesion and\ncytokine production (via interaction with CD229) or bind to immunoglobulin-Fc receptors\npostulated to contribute to epithelial cell tropism in vivo (Lilley et al. 2001; Atalay et al. 2002; Engel\net al. 2011). As these proteins bind host receptors that are themselves\npolymorphic, negative frequency-dependent selection for a tighter interaction with the\nvariety of ligands available in the host population could be driving their\ndiversification. Another known cause of the emergence of LD is the competition for\nresources such as cellular receptors among co-infecting strains, promoting a stably\ndiverse population of pathogens (Watkins et al.,\n2014); this mechanism promoting population structure is, however, expected to\nlead to long-range linkage among loci, which is not observed here (apart for the RL11\nlocus, see below).",

The common feature of this gene family is the RL11 core domain (RL11D),\nwhich shares homology with the adenovirus E3 family of proteins (Davison et al. 2003; Gabaev et al. 2011) which are important for evasion of T-cell responses and\ninhibition of cell death.

Immune evasion is postulated to favor the high levels of HCMV superinfection\nobserved in humans, and this in turn promotes recombination. This mechanism would allow HCMV\ngenomes to satisfy an evolutionary trade-off between short term pressures to evade host\nimmune recognition and a long-standing evolutionary constraint on a complex genome optimally\ntuned towards silent parasitism.",
