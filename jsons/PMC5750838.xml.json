Infectious diseases, especially by multi-resistant pathogens, are a major and massively increasing cause of mortality [10]. The complexity of health issues and interactions between animal and human health have been shown by global epidemics like Ebola, SARS, or H1N1. The novel paradigm of One Health provides a global and trans-disciplinary approach to tackle infectious diseases at the human, animal, and environmental interface [3]. In order to follow the integrated approach of One Health, a wide variety of information sources from all life science disciplines need to be considered in research [1].",

For this purpose, three multilingual life science thesauri are used (MeSH, UMTHES and AGROVOC). These are also used for subject indexing of the meta-data listed in LIVIVO, enhancing the content-based indexing of the original data. Index terms can later be used in the portal for refining the precision of the search. For example, a query for the German term Antibiotika-Resistenz is connected to the thesauri automatically finding documents with the terms Antimicrobial drug resistance and antibiotic / antimicrobial resistance.

This data-driven service features almost the complete functionality for searching and filtering queries as the web portal. The option to make use of LIVIVO\u2019s search capacities without using the web portal creates novel user scenarios. Examples of the novel user scenarios are the integration of LIVIVO as a discovery service into existing portal solutions.

            "text": "In the text and data mining workflow employed for the semantic enrichment of the ZB MED KE, there are used different life science knowledge resource, namely DrugBank [7], MeSH [13], and AGROVOC [2]. DrugBank is a comprehensive resource for pharmaceutical compounds that offers the classification of approved drugs according to the Anatomical Therapeutic Classification of Drugs and Drug Dosages (ATC) that is offered and maintained by the World Health Organization. The Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) are maintained by the National Library of Medicine providing a hierarchy of relevant concepts to the medical domain. The Multilingual agricultural thesaurus AGROVOC is maintained by the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations (FAO) that offers an ontological representation of agricultural and agriculture related concepts. All three resources are available as linked data. Potentially. There is an overlap with other existing knowledge bases, for example because of the intersection of the modeled domain with generic views or certain processes. In literature retrieval, the specificity of a knowledge resource for a specific domain is getting blurred by the overlay of generic concepts. There, specific concepts that represent the highest granularity of retrieved information are perturbed because of the high frequency of generic concepts [9]. Therefore, a mapping amongst the various knowledge resources has to be achieved in order to link common and generic concepts for the purpose of emphasizing highly specific concepts for the respective knowledge domain. This is required to improve the user experience in literature retrieval by providing a better resolution of semantic concepts that are used for query expansion, aggregation of search results, and concept based ranking methods. The standard scoring method is the fraction of term frequency and inverse document frequency (TF-IDF). TF-IDF is used for normalizing search results of matching terms according to the frequency of the terms in the complete corpus. In case of domain specific concepts, similar ranking function are derived as fraction of the concept frequency and the inverse document frequency (CF-IDF) [4]. The CF-IDF poses novel challenges compared to TF-IDF because concepts usually comprise spelling variants, synonyms, or even abbreviations because they have a large impact on the accuracy of the relevancy ranking.",
