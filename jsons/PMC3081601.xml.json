            "text": "The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) nonstructural protein (nsp) 7 is of interest for its potential roles in the transcription and replication of the positive-stranded viral RNA genome. The proteins nsp7\u2013nsp10, which are conserved among all coronaviruses (CoVs) but have no functional homologs outside of Coronaviridae, are translated as part of the viral polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab, and mature proteins are released by the action of the SARS-CoV protease nsp5.1, 2, 3 An important role of nsp7 is indicated by the observation that deletion of nsp7 or mutation of the nsp7/nsp8 proteolytic cleavage site is lethal to murine hepatitis virus (MHV).4 The expression of nsp7 in infected cells has been demonstrated for viruses belonging to three of the major CoV phylogenetic groups, namely, human CoV 229E (group I),5 MHV (group II),6 and avian infectious bronchitis virus (group III)7. During infection, nsp7 localizes to membrane-related sites of viral replication in the cytoplasm;5, 6, 8 and in MHV, it has been shown to interact specifically with nsp1 and nsp10 at sites of viral RNA synthesis.8\n",

A comparison of the nsp7 folds in the two structures revealed extensive differences in the sequence positions and lengths of the four helices, as well as in the spatial arrangement of the helices in the tertiary structure. Interestingly, both structure determinations led to the conclusion, based on Dali searches,12, 13 that nsp7 represented a novel fold.9, 10\n",

The present project was therefore initiated by the screening of a wide range of solution conditions in search of protein samples that would enable the recording of high-quality NMR data and the collection of more extensive sets of conformational constraints than had been possible at pH 7.5 and high ionic strengths.9 Based on the results of this screening, an aqueous solution at pH 6.5 and with low ionic strength was selected for a new NMR structure determination of nsp7. Additional NMR studies of conformational equilibria and dynamic processes further provided a foundation for rationalizing some aspects of variations among the three presently available nsp7 structures.",

Structure calculation then resulted in a high-quality NMR structure, as shown by the statistics for the final cycle of calculation (Table 1\n). The protein forms an antiparallel bundle of four helices (Fig. 2\na and b). The polypeptide segment 1\u201310, which includes the tag-derived residues Gly1 and His2, forms a disordered tail leading to a short extended segment of residues 11\u201312, which packs against the side chains of helices \u03b12 and \u03b14. Helix \u03b11 (residues 13\u201320) is linked by a well-defined loop of residues 21\u201328 with helix \u03b12 (residues 29\u201342). A short segment of nonregular secondary structure leads to helix \u03b13 (residues 47\u201365), and a short loop connects to helix \u03b14 (residues 70\u201382). Multiple structural homologs of the structure of Fig. 2a and b were identified by a Dali search of the Protein Data Bank (PDB).12, 13 These structural similarities probably result from the broad distribution of the four-helix bundle as a folding motif among protein families, and it is unlikely that these structural homologs indicate previously undetected functional homologs of nsp7 outside of Coronaviridae. The protein was further characterized by chemical cross-linking (Fig. 2c), which showed that nsp7 is monomeric in solution, and by a steady-state 15N{1H} nuclear Overhauser enhancement (NOE) experiment, which is sensitive to the picosecond-to-nanosecond timescale mobility of the polypeptide backbone. Increased subnanosecond mobility was evident for the N-terminal decapeptide segment and the C-terminal hexapeptide, which includes the last turn of helix \u03b14 (Fig. 1b), whereas the data for residues 13\u201379 show that this central polypeptide segment forms a compact globular fold.",

Protons that are involved in the hydrogen bonds of regular secondary structures or that are otherwise sequestered from the solvent experience lower rates of chemical exchange. Amide proton protection factor (Pf) is defined as log(k\nin/k\nex), where k\nex is the measured hydrogen/deuterium exchange rate constant, and k\nin is the intrinsic 1H/2H exchange rate constant for the same residue type when exposed to the solvent.29 In nsp7 at pH 6.5, helices \u03b12 and \u03b13 have the highest protection factors, followed by \u03b11 and \u03b14; for polypeptide segments with nonregular secondary structure, the protection was too small to be measured with the standard approach used here (Fig. 1c). The lack of protection for the amide protons of the N-terminal tetradecapeptide is in line with the presence of a short helix \u03b11 in the NMR structure (Fig. 1, Fig. 2).",

The reduced \u0394\u03b4(13C\u03b1) values of residues 78\u201382, compared to other helical regions (Fig. 1a), and the comparatively low protection factors for the entire helix (Fig. 1c) indicate that there is a reduced population of \u03b14 in the NMR structure because of a dynamic equilibrium with unstructured solvent-accessible conformations. The latter are apparently not manifested in the NOE-based NMR structure due to the absence of short 1H\u20131H distances corresponding to d\nNN, d\n\u03b1N(i, i + 3), and d\n\u03b1\u03b2(i, i + 3) in the helix.30 Since subnanosecond timescale motion of the protein backbone was observed only for the C-terminal hexapeptide segment of the protein (Fig. 1b), there was an indication that the conformational equilibria involving helix \u03b14 are governed by slower motions. This indication was confirmed by a line shape analysis. The residues Ser63 and Gln65 near the C-terminal end of \u03b13, Val68 in the loop joining \u03b13 and \u03b14, and Asn71 and Leu73 at the start of \u03b14 all exhibit a pronounced line broadening when compared with residues in molecular regions that are not directly affected by rate processes involving \u03b14 (Fig. 3\n). This line broadening was more pronounced when the temperature was decreased from 308 K to 288 K, indicating that the exchange between \u03b14 and conformations with solvent-exposed amide groups approaches the fast rate limit on the chemical shift timescale at 308 K (millisecond-to-submillisecond timescale) such that a single averaged signal is seen at all temperatures in Fig. 3.",

In addition, we obtained new information on the timescale of conformational equilibria in the solution structure at pH 6.5. A closer look at the three presently available nsp7 structures reveals that the crystal structure of the complex with nsp8 differs from the pH 6.5 solution structure primarily by a rotation of helix \u03b14 away from the \u03b12/\u03b13 core and by helical folding of the polypeptide segment of residues 3\u201312 (Fig. 4a). The long helix \u03b11 in the crystal structure (Fig. 4c), which would not be compatible with the amide proton protection factors measured in solution at pH 6.5 (Fig. 1c), then occupies the position taken by \u03b14 in the pH 6.5 solution structure (Fig. 4a). In the pH 7.5 solution structure, \u03b14 is packed against \u03b13 and has no contacts with \u03b12, so that helices \u03b12, \u03b13, and \u03b14 line up to form a flat three-helix sheet (Fig. 4b), with \u03b11 packed at an angle of about 45\u00b0 against \u03b12 and \u03b13.",

Binding to nsp8 would trigger the formation of the short helix \u03b14 immediately after \u03b13, as well as the formation of the long helix \u03b11 (Fig. 4c), which then takes up the position occupied by \u03b14 in the pH 6.5 solution structure (Fig. 4a). In the crystal structure, the locations of \u03b11 and \u03b14 are stabilized by numerous contacts with hydrophobic side chains of nsp8, in addition to intramolecular contacts within nsp7, and residues 79\u201385 are structurally disordered, as evidenced by the lack of electron density. The conformational variability of \u03b14 was seen also in the complex with nsp8, since the different molecules in the asymmetric unit of the crystal structure have different orientations of helix \u03b14.10 There is thus an indication that locking of helix \u03b14 of nsp7 in a conformation that prevents binding to nsp8 could impair the replication machinery of the virus, which might provide the lead for future drug designs.",

Considering the transient unfolding of \u03b14 at pH 6.5, the scarce interactions of \u03b14 with the rest of the protein in the pH 7.5 solution structure, and the complete lack of such interactions in the crystal structure, we truncated nsp7 at the end of helix \u03b13. Constructs consisting of residues 1\u201365, 1\u201366, 1\u201367, 1\u201369, 1\u201370, and 1\u201372 all yielded partly folded, poorly soluble proteins that were not amenable to structure determination by NMR (M. D. Geralt, P. Serrano, M.A.J., and K.W., unpublished data). Conformations of the type observed at pH 6.5 in which helix \u03b14 associates intimately with the bulk of the protein thus seem to be essential for protein stability and folding, and hence for the functional integrity of nsp7.",

Each spectrum was acquired for 4\u201315 min, and the study was continued for 11 days. Peak intensities were fitted to an exponential equation of the form I = I0exp(\u2212 kext), where we accounted for residual peak intensities.
