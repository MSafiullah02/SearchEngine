The clinical manifestations of dengue virus infection range from asymptomatic infection, undifferentiated fever and dengue fever (with agonizing limb pain and sobriquet of break-bone fever), to dengue hemorrhagic fever with plasma leakage and potentially life-threatening dengue shock syndrome. Thus, dengue virus infection remains an important public health burden requiring continuing attention. The diverse host responses against dengue virus infection correlate with the activation of not only humoral and cell-mediated immunity, but also autoimmunity (Lin et al., 2006).",

COX-2 is the rate-limiting enzyme for catalysis of arachidonic acid to prostaglandin G2, which by peroxidase is further reduced to prostaglandin H2 (PGH2), the precursor of various prostanoids, namely prostaglandins (including prostaglandin E2, PGE2), prostacyclins and thromboxanes (Tsatsanis et al., 2006). Overexpression of COX-2 leads to increased levels of PGE2, a central mediator of inflammation (Williams et al., 1999). PGE2 is one of the most important pro-inflammatory cytokines, associated with induction of inflammation, leukocyte chemoattraction, and pain perception. PGE2 modulates immune function in inflammatory reactions, regulates viral replication and virulence, and participates in a wide range of normal physiological processes (Phipps et al., 1991).",

Activated PGE2 may protect the cell from invasion but also be used by some viruses to favor viral production (Steer and Corbett, 2003). Induced COX-2 expression and resultant prostaglandins may also play an anti-inflammatory role (Lawrence et al., 2002).

Triptolide also impairs dendritic cell migration by inhibiting COX-2 and CCR7 expression through NF-\u03baB and phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3-K)/Akt pathway (Liu et al., 2007).

These findings imply that a high dose of tetrandrine changed the composition of NF-\u03baB in A549 cells infected with dengue virus. In A549 cells without dengue virus infection, the bands of NF-\u03baB were also shifted and patterns also changed at high concentration of tetrandrine (Fig. 8B). To confirm that the unusual bands appearing on the EMSA at higher concentration of tetrandrine were NF-\u03baB specific, competition experiments were performed with a 100-fold molar excess of non-radioactive wild-type NF-\u03baB with canonical sequence (NF-\u03baB competitor), or a mutant NF-\u03baB to ensure that the normal NF-\u03baB band reappeared.",

The dengue virus-induced activation of AP-1 reached a peak at 40 h post-infection, but NF-\u03baB might reach its peak later. The dengue virus-induced COX-2 expression in both A549 and dendritic cells occurred earlier than 24 h post-infection (Fig. 1A, C), but the dengue virus-induced PGE2 production was not obvious until 40 h post-infection (Fig. 1D). Once activated, the time course between COX-2 mRNA expression and COX-2 protein production generally correlated well. COX-2 expression is induced within 2\u20136 h in several types of cells including fibroblasts, endothelial cells and monocytes in response to bacterial endotoxins, cytokines, hormones or growth factors (Tsatsanis et al., 2006). In our study of A549 cells infected with dengue virus, the AP-1 activation seemed to occur earlier than NF-\u03baB but with a shorter duration. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that dengue virus infection in human lung cells can activate NF-\u03baB and AP-1, both transcription factors of the COX-2 gene. It suggests that dengue virus infection in A549 cells might induce numerous intracellular signaling cascades converging with the activation of NF-\u03baB, AP-1 and possibly other transcription factors, which act independently or coordinately to regulate expression of cox-2 and subsequent PGE2 release.",

In China, it is traditionally prescribed to treat hypertension, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammation and silicosis and might possess anticancer, immunosuppressive and free radical scavenging activities (Ho and Lai, 2004). Tetrandrine has been shown to inhibit NF-\u03baB activation in human peripheral blood T cells induced by various stimuli through downregulation of the I\u03baB\u03b1 kinases-I\u03baB\u03b1-NF-\u03baB signaling pathway (Ho et al., 2004) and in LPS-stimulated pancreatic acinar cells of rat (Zhang et al., 2006). However, in our study, tetrandrine at high concentration further activated COX-2 and markedly increased PGE2 production, more than 17 times over control, corresponding to the activation of NF-\u03baB and AP-1. High-concentration tetrandrine also activated COX-2 expression, and NF-\u03baB and AP-1 activity in the absence of dengue virus infection. An early study exploring the cytotoxicity of tetrandrine on mouse peritoneal macrophages found the dose-dependent loss of cell viability was accompanied by the generation of PGE2 to levels 285\u2013877% of control (Pang and Hoult, 1997), suggesting evidence of COX-2 activation by tetrandrine at high concentration.",

In two early studies, it was shown that aspirin at high concentration not only inhibited COX but also directly inhibited the activity of NF-\u03baB in Jurkat cells and AP-1 in JB6 cells (Dong et al., 1997, Kopp and Ghosh, 1994), implying that aspirin might inhibit NF-\u03baB and AP-1 in a cell-specific fashion. It was also shown that salicylates restricted flavivirus replication independent of the NF-\u03baB pathway (Liao et al., 2001), implying that NF-\u03baB might not be the target for antiviral therapy; i.e. NSAIDs might yield their antiviral effect though the COX/PGE2 pathway instead. In our study, the activation of NF-\u03baB and AP-1 in dengue virus-infected A549 cells could be via either defensive or defeated pathway, but an inflammatory response to dengue virus infection was indicated by the corresponding activation of COX-2 and PGE2. However, triptolide, while it dose-dependently inhibited the dengue virus-activated COX-2/PGE2/NF-\u03baB/AP-1, did not affect viral production at all. This implies that dengue virus did not usurp NF-\u03baB and AP-1 pathway for replication. Nevertheless, the post-infection anti-inflammatory effect of triptolide through blockage of COX-2/PGE2 still holds treatment potential via attenuation of the overwhelming inflammation and agonizing bone pain in dengue fever. On the contrary, the potential antiviral effect of tetrandrine might act by way of activating NF-\u03baB and AP-1, rather than COX-2/PGE2, although both were enhanced by tetrandrine at high concentration.",

            "text": "In our EMSA study, it was incidentally found that high concentration of tetrandrine induced mobility shift and band pattern changes in NF-\u03baB and AP-1 in A549 cells, probably by activation of non-specific protein binding. Because both NF-\u03baB and AP-1 are implicated in the expression of various genes, tetrandrine-modified NF-\u03baB and AP-1 may collaborate with other transcription factors or enhancers, and thus activate other genes involved in inflammation or immune response in addition to COX-2. This might explain our finding that high-concentration tetrandrine suppressed virus production in dengue virus-infected A549 cells.",

            "text": "In conclusion, herein we demonstrated that dengue virus infection induced COX-2/PGE2 expression in human lung cells, similarly to dendritic cells, presumably via activation of NF-\u03baB and AP-1. Triptolide suppressed these viral-induced inflammatory responses in a dose-dependent manner, but failed to affect virus production. Conversely, tetrandrine at high concentration enhanced COX-2/PGE2, activated and modified NF-\u03baB and AP-1 in A549 cells, regardless of infection status. Surprisingly, tetrandrine, not triptolide, suppressed virus production in A549 cells. Our data demonstrating the differential effects of triptolide and tetrandrine shed light on the immune response to dengue virus infection via COX-2 and its transcription factors, and suggest the potential for anti-inflammatory and antiviral therapy with herbal medicines. Additional gene or transcription factor targets of modulation by triptolide or tetrandrine deserve further investigation.",
