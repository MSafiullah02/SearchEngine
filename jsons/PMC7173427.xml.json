Additionally, accidental or intentional introduction of different organisms is exerting additional pressures on native animal species, and in certain cases the former becomes invasive.1 In natural habitats, introduced animals have been shown to reduce or eliminate populations of endemic species through different mechanisms, such as direct predation or the reduction of available resources.2 This increase in native-exotic animal interactions also presents a potential for \u201cpathogen pollution,\u201d or the introduction of a pathogen into a new geographic area or host species.3 Invaders may also act as an additional competent host for native pathogens, thereby increasing infection rates of native species via spillback mechanisms.4 Additionally, invader-borne pathogens may have more subtle and persistent effects and alter the outcomes of trophic or competitive interactions.5 In fact, a shared pathogen can have considerable impact on the population size and the distribution of native species, even if the introduced species does not compete directly with the native species for resources; this is called \u201capparent competition\u201d and is illustrated by the success of the invasive gray squirrel (Sciurus carolinensis) and the decline of the native red squirrel (S. vulgaris) in the United Kingdom\u2014the result of apparent competition mediated by a parapox virus.6, 7\n",

For instance, a survey has shown that in some areas of Madagascar, black rats (Rattus rattus) now constitute 95%\u2013100% of the rodent population, effectively replacing the endemic rodents, even in rainforest habitats away from human habitation (Dammhahn, unpublished data).18 Likewise, research on carnivorans inhabiting several regions of Madagascar has shown an alarming correlation between increasing numbers of introduced cats and dogs and decreasing detection of endemic euplerids and lemurs.19 As elsewhere in the world, the reason for the observed declines is likely a combination of factors, including resource competition, predation, and disease.20, 21 This chapter attempts to review the literature on pathogen introduction from exotic hosts and highlights the risks of disease introduction on the rich and unique fauna of Madagascar.",

The number of Palearctic migrants, particularly Passeriformes, passing through Madagascar is very limited compared with continental Africa; this has important implications for the potential transmission of pathogens between birds.31 In addition, several species have been introduced either intentionally for food production (e.g., poultry and other domestic fowl) or pest control (common myna [Acridotheres tristis]) or accidentally (house sparrow [Passer domesticus] and house crow [Corvus splendens]). These nonnative birds may facilitate the introduction of pathogens and pose different threats to the native Malagasy avifauna, as has been the case for bird populations elsewhere.10, 11 For example, in the Gal\u00e1pagos, it is thought that the introduction of the avipoxvirus and Haemoproteus blood pathogens in the 19th century was associated with either pet caged birds or natural songbird migration.32 Some species of Haemoproteus are known to reduce the physical condition and reproductive success of captive and wild birds; on Madagascar, this genus and Plasmodium are transmitted by numerous species of mosquitoes living sympatrically with native birds.33, 34 Most studies of bird pathogens on Madagascar focus on domestic fowl, and only a few investigations have documented pathogens infecting the island's native birds.33, 35\n",

For example, the human-adapted protozoan Cryptosporidium hominis is now found in the eastern rufous mouse lemur (Microcebus rufus) and the greater bamboo lemur (Prolemur simus) living in Ranomafana National Park, as well as the ring-tailed lemur (Lemur catta) in southwestern Madagascar.50, 51 This zoonotic protozoan has a high prevalence rate in people, domestic animals, and peridomestic rodents inhabiting villages in the vicinity of protected areas; the parasite was most likely transmitted to lemurs as a result of increased exposure to humans.52 In captive lemurs, Cryptosporidium sp. has caused high morbidity and mortality.53\n",
