In contrast to SARS-CoV ORF3b, however, 167 SARS-CoV-2 harbors four premature stop codons that result in the expression of a 168 drastically shortened ORF3b protein ( Figure 3A ). Similar patterns were observed in 169 SARS-CoV-2-related viruses from bats and pangolins. Since the ORF3b length is 170",

ORFs with low similarity (e.g., ORF8 and ORF9b) were excluded 550 from this analysis. 551 (C) Potent anti-IFN-I activity of SARS-CoV-2 ORF3b. HEK293 cells were 552 cotransfected with five different amounts of plasmids expressing HA-tagged SARS-553 CoV-2 ORF3b, SARS-CoV ORF3b, and IAV NS1 (50, 100, 200, 300, and 500 ng) 554 and p125Luc, a plasmid encoding firefly luciferase under the control of the human 555 IFNB1 promoter (500 ng). 24 h post transfection, SeV was inoculated at MOI 10. 556 24 h post infection, the cells were harvested for Western blotting (top) and luciferase 557 assay (bottom). For Western blotting, the input of cell lysate was normalized to TUBA, 558",
