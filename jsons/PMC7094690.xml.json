A key difference among influenza virus types is their host range.10 Type A viruses have been isolated from a wide range of species, including humans, pigs, horses, seals, ferrets, mink, whales, and birds. Types B and C viruses infect humans predominantly but have also been isolated from seals and pigs, respectively.7 Influenza A viruses can be divided into subtypes based on surface glycoproteins, hemagglutinin and neuraminidase. To date, 15 different hemagglutinin (H1-H15) and 9 neuraminidase (N1-N9) proteins have been identified.10 Hemagglutinin facilitates entry of the virus into host cells through its attachment to sialic acid on epithelial cell receptors, promotes membrane fusion, and elicits protective neutralizing antibody response. Hemagglutinin is the crucial component of influenza vaccines. Neuraminidase has enzyme activity, which cleaves sialic acid on virion proteins, facilitating the release of progeny virions from infected cells. It is an important target for antiviral agents.11 Although all influenza A virus subtypes have been found in birds, only 3 different hemagglutinin (H1, H2, or H3) and 2 different neuraminidase (N1 or N2) proteins have circulated widely in humans.",

During antigenic drift, mutations occur because of the lack of the proofreading activity of viral RNA polymerases. As a consequence, new antigenic variants emerge constantly, allowing the virus to evade immune recognition and giving rise to annual epidemics. The antigenic drift of influenza viruses requires the replacement of influenza strains used in the vaccine every several years.12 During antigenic shift, new strains appear to which most humans have no immunity and that have the potential to cause severe global outbreaks of human influenza. These pandemic strains derive from nonhuman viruses by interspecies transmission of the whole virus or by genetic reassortment between avian and human viruses that have infected a single cell. Pigs have receptors for both avian and human influenza viruses and have been considered an intermediate host for the reassortment of influenza viruses. Reemergence of a previously circulating virus to which most of the population is immunologically naive is another mechanism by which pandemic strains can occur.13\n",

The hemagglutinins of avian strains bind preferentially to host receptors terminating in an \u03b1(2,3)-linked sialic acid, whereas human strains bind preferentially to receptors terminating in an \u03b1(2,6)-linkage. The predominance of these receptors in different tissues partly reflects the tropism of influenza in different species.5 Receptor specificity and inability of efficient replication in vivo were believed to provide a barrier against human infection by avian influenza virus. High doses of avian influenza virus strains were required for replication in volunteers. The first human infections by avian H5N1 virus in Hong Kong in 1997 showed that receptor specificity was not a definitive host restriction factor.14 In this epidemic, an intermediate host was not necessary for transmission of avian strains to humans.",

Wild waterfowl and migrating bird populations provide an extensive natural reservoir for influenza A viruses (Figure 1\n).15 The virus multiplies in the intestines of these birds, particularly in wild ducks, and they can carry the virus without developing signs of infection, indicating an optimal level of viral adaptation in these hosts. Therefore, influenza is not an eradicable disease, and prevention and control of outbreaks are the only realistic goals.16 Unlike mammalian influenza virus strains, avian viruses have shown little antigenic variability during the past decades. The high level of genetic conservation suggests that avian viruses have reached an evolutionary stage in which antigenic changes provide no selective advantage.",

Once introduced into domestic flocks, the virus can spread among farms via contaminated inanimate objects, contributing to the rapid evolution of epidemics. Avian influenza in birds is characterized by a wide spectrum of symptoms, ranging from a mild illness to a highly contagious, severe, and rapidly fatal disease with a mortality rate approaching 100%. The latter syndrome was formerly known as fowl plague; it is now termed highly pathogenic avian influenza and is characterized by coughing, sneezing, excessive lacrimation, cyanosis of the unfeathered skin, edema of the head, ruffled feathers, diarrhea, nervous system disorders, or sudden death without clinical signs.15 In the past, most outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza in poultry have been due to subtypes H5 or H7.",

To reduce the risk of reemergence of avian influenza, all aquatic birds were removed from retail markets, including ducks, geese, and quails (source of the H5N1 strain). Monthly \u201cclean days\u201d were introduced when all markets are emptied and cleaned simultaneously. New regulations mandate quarantine of poultry in designated farms in mainland China for 5 days and testing for H5 infection before importation to Hong Kong.18 Other control measures include continuous surveillance of influenza virus strains in humans and in birds, careful protection of cullers through appropriate personal protective equipment, restrictions on the movement of live poultry, and use of the human influenza vaccine to reduce the risk of coinfection in poultry workers and cullers.4\n",

Hippocrates in ancient Greece described the first case of influenza-like illness. In the 20th century, 4 human influenza pandemics emerged with intervals of 9 to 39 years .14 The Spanish influenza of 1918-1919 (H1N1) was the most devastating pandemic in recorded human history, resulting in 25 to 50 million deaths worldwide; nearly half of those who died were healthy young adults. This figure is at least double the number of soldiers killed on the battlefields of Europe during World War I. Other less catastrophic pandemics occurred in 1957 (Asian influenza), 1968 (Hong Kong influenza), and 1977 (Russian influenza). The Asian (H2N2) and Hong Kong (H3N2) pandemic strains were generated by reassortment between human and avian viral genes. The Russian influenza virus (H1N1) circulated in the 1950s and reemerged in 1977. The illness occurred almost exclusively among persons younger than 20 years. The relatively low mortality rate associated with this pandemic can be attributed to the immunity of older individuals who had antibodies from their previous exposure to nearly identical viruses.7\n",

In 1997, the first documented direct transmission of an avian influenza virus to humans occurred in Hong Kong, when an H5N1 strain caused a severe respiratory disease in 18 previously healthy young adults, 6 of whom died.3 The outbreak in Hong Kong was controlled by the destruction of the entire poultry population; within 3 days, more than 1.5 million chickens were killed. In 1999, avian influenza H9N2 viruses were isolated for the first time in humans; 2 children were hospitalized with uncomplicated upper respiratory tract infection in Hong Kong, and both recovered completely.19 In May 2001 and in February and April 2002, the poultry stocks in Hong Kong were again destroyed when the highly pathogenic H5N1 virus reemerged in flocks. However, no more human cases of H5N1 influenza were identified until February 2003, when 2 cases were confirmed in 2 Hong Kong residents after travel to China, 1 of whom died.19 In February 2003, a large outbreak of H7N7 avian influenza occurred in poultry farms in the Netherlands.20 The virus caused mild illness in several farm workers, but a veterinarian who had visited an affected farm died of pneumonia. The virus isolated from the fatal case displayed 14 amino acid substitutions, which possibly contributed to the increased disease severity. All farm workers received mandatory influenza vaccination and prophylaxis with oseltamivir.21 The H7N7 poultry outbreak subsequently spread to Germany and Belgium but was eventually controlled by destruction of more than 30 million domestic poultry. In February 2004, another outbreak of H7N7 avian influenza occurred on a poultry farm in British Columbia, Canada, and resulted in at least 5 humans with infection, mainly conjunctivitis.1 Recently, the crystal structure of the hemagglutinin from the 1918 virus was determined, explaining why this virus was able to spread efficiently in the human population despite retainment of the avian receptor-binding site.6\n",

In a cohort study including 3 hospitals in Hong Kong at which patients infected with H5N1 strains had been admitted, a significantly higher seropositivity rate for H5N1 was found among exposed health care workers (3.7%) than among nonexposed ones (0.7%), providing epidemiological evidence of transmission from infected patients to health care workers.23 In the Netherlands in 2003, 3 family members of farm workers were infected during the H7N7 outbreak, demonstrating the ability of human-to-human transmission.20\n",

On January 8, 2004, authorities in Vietnam also reported several outbreaks of avian influenza H5N1 at farms in the southern provinces. Human cases of H5N1 avian influenza presenting as severe respiratory illness occurred, with a mortality rate of more than 70%. On January 11, 2004, the World Health Organization alerted the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network to support health authorities in the epidemiological investigation and containment of human cases. These H5N1 viruses are substantially different from the H5N1 viruses in outbreaks in Hong Kong in 1997 and 2003, indicating that the virus has mutated. On January 23, 2004, authorities in Thailand reported an outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza among poultry, with laboratory-confirmed cases of H5N1 infection in humans.24 Japan, the European Union, the United States, and other major export markets banned import of poultry products from the affected Asian countries.",

Of the 10 patients, 9 had a history of direct contact with poultry (chicken or ducks), with a median time before onset of illness of 3 days (range, 2-4 days). The main clinical features were fever, shortness of breath, cough, and diarrhea. Notably, sore throat, coryza, and conjunctivitis were absent. All patients presented with pronounced lymphopenia (mean lymphocyte count, 0.7 \u00d7 109/L) and important chest radiographic abnormalities including diffuse, multifocal, or patchy infiltrates or segmental or lobular consolidation. Eight of the 10 patients (80%) died after a mean of 10 days of illness. The clinical features, together with liver dysfunction, renal failure, coagulopathy, and pancytopenia seen in the 1997 Hong Kong H5N1 outbreak, are similar to those seen in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome.",

Factors associated with severe disease included older age, delay in hospitalization, lower respiratory tract involvement, and leukopenia or lymphopenia at admission.

The optimal specimen for influenza virus detection is a nasopharyngeal aspirate obtained within 3 days of the onset of symptoms; however, nasopharyngeal swabs and other specimens can be used. The H5N1 influenza virus can be detected by rapid antigen tests, virus culture, and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). At least 6 rapid antigen detection assays are commercially available and provide results in 15 to 30 minutes but are not as sensitive or specific as virus culture or RT-PCR.10 Virus isolation in cell cultures enables further antigenic and genetic characterization, drug susceptibility testing, and vaccine preparation. However, cultures take 2 to 10 days and must be performed under Biosafety Level 3+ laboratory conditions. Conventional and real-time PCR assays detect diverse influenza type A viruses, including the avian H5N1 strains.28, 29 Polymerase chain reaction primers are directed to the conserved matrix gene of the virus, and therefore this assay would be expected to detect recombinant avian strains of the virus. Of emphasis, avian influenza virus may be recombinant strains of the virus and may not contain the essential genes for replication in laboratory cultures.14 Rapid antigen detection and RT-PCR can be performed with standard Biosafety Level 2 laboratory conditions in a class II biological safety cabinet. Serologic diagnosis of influenza is based on the detection of a 4-fold or greater increase in specific antibody titer in paired serum samples; the first should be collected as soon as possible after onset of illness and the second, 10 to 14 days later. This limits the usefulness of serology in the diagnosis and treatment of acute illness.",

Alternative means of producing H5 and H7 vaccines were exploited, including the plasmid-based reverse genetic technology.9 A vaccine strain can be created by merging selected hemagglutinin and neuraminidase genes from the target virus with a laboratory virus. The resulting virus is recognized by the human immune system and causes a protective immune response but no disease. However, such vaccines have yet to be studied in clinical trials, and safety testing must be completed.",

Clinicians should be cognizant of human influenza H5N1 infection among patients with the appropriate epidemiological exposure, so that patients can be identified quickly and managed appropriately and health care workers can be protected.
