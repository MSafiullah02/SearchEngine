            "text": "In order to examine whether the introduced pyridone ring is compatible with the\nthree-dimensional structure of the target, we determined the crystal structure, at 1.75\n\u00c5 resolution, of the Mpro of SARS-CoV-2 (Fig.\n2). The three-dimensional structure is highly similar to that of the SARS-CoV\nMpro, as expected from the 96% sequence identity (see fig. S7); the r.m.s.\ndeviation between the two free-enzyme structures is 0.53 \u00c5 for all C\u03b1 positions\n(comparison between SARS-CoV-2 Mpro structure and SARS-CoV Mpro, PDB\nentry 2BX4 (7)). The chymotrypsin- and\npicornavirus 3C protease-like domains I and II (residues 10-99 and 100-182, respectively) are\nsix-stranded antiparallel \u03b2-barrels that harbor the substrate-binding site between\nthem. Domain III (residues 198-303), a globular cluster of five helices, is involved in\nregulating dimerization of the Mpro, mainly through a salt-bridge interaction\nbetween Glu290 of one protomer and Arg4 of the other (8). The tight dimer formed by SARS-CoV-2\nMpro has a contact interface, predominantly between domain II of molecule A and\nthe NH2-terminal residues (\u201cN-finger\u201d) of molecule B, of ~1394\n\u00c52, with the two molecules oriented perpendicular to one another (Fig. 2). Dimerization of the enzyme is necessary for\ncatalytic activity, because the N-finger of each of the two protomers interacts with\nGlu166 of the other protomer and thereby helps shape the S1 pocket of the\nsubstrate-binding site (9). To reach\nthis interaction site, the N-finger is squeezed in between domains II and III of the parent\nmonomer and domain II of the other monomer. Interestingly, in the SARS-CoV but not in the\nSARS-CoV-2 Mpro dimer, there is a polar interaction between the two domains III\ninvolving a 2.60-\u00c5 hydrogen bond between the side-chain hydroxyl groups of residue\nThr285 of each protomer, and supported by a hydrophobic contact between the\nside-chain of Ile286 and Thr285 C\u03b32. In SARS-CoV-2, the threonine\nis replaced by alanine (indicated by the black sphere in Fig.\n2), and the isoleucine by leucine (see fig. S7). It has previously been shown that\nreplacing Ser284, Thr285, and Ile286 by alanine residues in\nSARS-CoV Mpro leads to a 3.6-fold enhancement of the catalytic activity of the\nprotease, concomitant with a slightly closer packing of the two domains III of the dimer\nagainst one another (10). This was\naccompanied by changes in enzyme dynamics that transmit the effect of the mutation to the\ncatalytic center. Indeed, the Thr285Ala replacement observed in the SARS-CoV-2\nMpro also allows the two domains III to approach each other a little closer (the\ndistance between the C\u03b1 atoms of residues 285 in molecules A and B is 6.77 \u00c5 in\nSARS-CoV Mpro and 5.21 \u00c5 in SARS-CoV-2 Mpro and the distance\nbetween the centers of mass of the two domains III shrinks from 33.4 \u00c5 to 32.1\n\u00c5). However, the catalytic efficiency of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro is only slightly\nhigher, if at all (kcat/Km = 3426.1\n\u00b1 416.9 s\u22121M\u22121) than that of SARS-CoV\nMpro (kcat/Km = 3011.3\n\u00b1 294.6 s\u22121M\u22121). Further, the estimated\nKd of dimer dissociation is the same (~2.5 \u03bcM) for the\ntwo enzymes, as determined by analytical ultracentrifugation (fig. S8).",

            "text": "We used this crystal structure to dock the \u03b1-ketoamide 13a; this\nsuggested that the pyridone ring might have some steric clash with the side-chain of Gln189.\nHowever, in our previous work (6), we\nhad found Gln189 to be quite flexible and therefore we went ahead with 13a as a lead. The\nplasma half-life of this compound in mice was increased ~3-fold compared to 11r\n(from 0.3 hours to 1.0 hours), the in-vitro kinetic plasma solubility was\nimproved by a factor of ~19 (from 6 \u03bcM for 11r to 112 \u03bcM for\n13a) and the thermodynamic solubility by a factor of ~13 (from 41 \u03bcM to\n530 \u03bcM). Binding to mouse plasma protein was reduced from 99% to 97% (many drugs have\nplasma protein binding of >90%; (11)). However, compared to 11r (IC50 = 0.18\n\u00b1 0.02 \u03bcM), the structural modification led to some loss of inhibitory activity\nagainst the main protease of SARS-CoV-2 (IC50 = 2.39 \u00b1 0.63 \u03bcM) as\nwell as the 3C proteases (3Cpro) of enteroviruses. 11r was designed for\nbroad-spectrum activity, with the P2 cyclohexyl moiety intended to fill a pocket in the\nenterovirus 3Cpro. The S2 pocket of the betacoronavirus Mpro (see Fig. 3) features substantial plasticity enabling it to adapt\nto the shape of smaller inhibitor moieties (6). To enhance the antiviral activity against betacoronaviruses of\nclade b (SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV), we sacrificed the goal of broad-spectrum activity and\nreplaced the P2 cyclohexyl moiety of 13a by the smaller cyclopropyl in\n13b (Fig. 1, blue circles). Here we\npresent X-ray crystal structures in two different crystal forms, at 1.95 and 2.20 \u00c5\nresolution, of the complex between \u03b1-ketoamide 13b and the Mpro\nof SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 3). One structure is in space group\nC2, where both protomers of the Mpro dimer are bound by crystal\nsymmetry to have identical conformations, the other is in space group\nP212121, where the two protomers are\nindependent of each other and free to adopt different conformations. Indeed, we find that in\nthe latter crystal structure, the key residue Glu166 adopts an inactive\nconformation in protomer B (as evidenced by its distance from His172 and the lack\nof H-bonding interaction with the P1 moiety of the inhibitor), even though compound\n13b is bound in the same mode as in molecule A. This phenomenon has also been\nobserved with the SARS-CoV Mpro (12) and is consistent with the half-site activity described for\nthis enzyme (13). In all copies of the\ninhibited SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, the inhibitor binds to the shallow substrate-binding\nsite at the surface of each protomer, between domains I and II (Fig. 3).",

The P2\ncyclopropyl methyl moiety fits snugly into the S2 subsite, which has shrunk by 28\n\u00c53 compared to the complex between compound 13a with P2 =\ncyclohexyl methyl and the SARS-CoV Mpro (17). The pyridone in the P3 - P2 position of the inhibitor\noccupies the space normally filled by the substrate's main chain, its carbonyl oxygen accepts\na 2.89/2.99/3.00-\u00c5 hydrogen bond from the main-chain amide of residue\nGlu166. Further, the P3 amide donates a 2.83/2.96/2.87-\u00c5 H-bond to the\nmain-chain oxygen of Glu166. Embedded within the pyridone, the P2 nitrogen can no\nlonger donate a hydrogen bond to the protein (the H-bond prevented from forming would connect\nthe P2 nitrogen and the side-chain oxygen of Gln189; these two atoms are highlighted in fig.\nS8). However, our previous crystal structures showed that the P2 main-chain amide of the\nlinear \u03b1-ketoamides does not make a hydrogen bond with the protein in all cases, so\nthis interaction does not seem to be critical (6). The protecting Boc group on P3 does not occupy the canonical\nS4 site of the protease (in contrast to the protecting groups of other inhibitors in complex\nwith the SARS-CoV Mpro (18)), but is located near Pro168 (3.81/4.17/3.65 \u00c5;\nFig. 3); due to this interaction, the latter residue\nmoves outward by more than 2 \u00c5 (compared to the structure of the free enzyme). This\ncontact explains why removing the Boc group as in compound 14b (Fig. 1, purple circles) weakens the inhibitory potency of\nthis compound by a factor of about 2. Interestingly, there is a space between the pyridone\nring of 13b, the main chain of residue Thr190, and the side-chain of\nGln189 (smallest distance: 3.6 \u00c5) which is filled by a DMSO molecule in\nthe C2 crystal structure and a water molecule in the\nP212121 structure. This suggests that P3\nmoieties more bulky than pyridone may be accepted here.",

This means that after 30 min, around 80% for mouse and 60% for\nhumans, respectively, of residual compound remained metabolically stable. Pharmacokinetic\nstudies in CD-1 mice using the subcutaneous route at 20 mg/kg showed that 13a\nstayed in plasma for up to only 4 hours, but was excreted via urine for up to 24 hours. The\nCmax was determined at 334.5 ng/mL and the mean residence time was about 1.6\nhours. Although 13a seemed to be cleared very rapidly from plasma, it was found\nat 24 hours at 135 ng/g tissue in the lung and at 52.7 ng/mL in broncheo-alveolar lavage fluid\n(BALF) suggesting that it was mainly distributed to tissue. Next, we investigated\n13b for its pharmacokinetic properties in CD-1 mice using the subcutaneous\nroute as well, but at 3 mg/kg. ADME parameters of 13b were similar to\n13a; in addition, the binding to human plasma proteins was found to be 90%. The\nCmax of 13b was determined at 126.2 ng/mL. This is around 37% of the\nCmax detected for 13a, although 13b dosage was\napproximately 7-times lower. The mean residence time for 13b was extended to 2.7\nhours and the plasma half-life in mice was 1.8 hours. In addition, 13b showed a\nless rapid clearance compared to 13a (table S3). During the pharmacokinetic study\nwith 13b, we monitored its lung tissue levels. After 4 hours, around 13 ng/g\n13b were still found in lung tissue. This lung tropism of 13a and\n13b is beneficial given that COVID-19 affects the lungs. In addition to\nsubcutaneous administration, 13b was nebulized using an inhalation device at 3\nmg/kg. After 24 hours, 33 ng/g 13b were found in lung tissue. Inhalation was\ntolerated well and mice did not show any adverse effects, suggesting that this way, direct\nadministration of the compound to the lungs would be possible. Given these favorable\npharmacokinetic results, our study provides a useful framework for development of the\npyridone-containing inhibitors toward anticoronaviral drugs.",
