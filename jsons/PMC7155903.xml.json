Level 2 infection control consists of disposable hat, medical masks (N95 or above), eye/face shields (anti-fog), scrub, disposable gloves, and disposable shoe covers. Level 3 infection control procedures are composed of all level 2 requirements and replace eye/face shields with positive pressure respirator hoods.

Overcoming these obstacles is critical in ensuring that every patient can receive standard and effective treatment, which in effect enhances the confidence of the patient population and reduces the burdens on the government. The model demonstrated has greatly contributed to the timely control of a new and widespread epidemic. Currently, two of the 17 Ark Hospitals have been successfully retired as better control of the COVID-19 epidemic has now been achieved in Wuhan, China.",
