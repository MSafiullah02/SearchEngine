Patients in subacute care or nursing facilities were no longer eligible for treatment until discharged and we utilized hypofractionation to shorten treatment schedules per expert-consensus, when feasible [2-5].

Patients with high-risk exposure are immediately quarantined and must either remain asymptomatic for a minimum of 10 days prior to treatment (i.e., two standard deviations of the average incubation period) and/or obtain a negative COVID-19 test, if available.

The remaining four (3%) patients were monitored due to high-risk exposures (e.g., same household family member COVID-19 positive) but adequately evaluated and cleared through short-term quarantine, symptom evaluation, and/or negative COVID testing without impacting their treatment course. Of the 11 affected patients, seven were cleared and rescheduled for treatment, resulting in a median delay of seven days (range 2-32 days). Four patients, however, are indefinitely delayed or have stopped treatment entirely, including three confirmed COVID-19 infections in total. Of these three, one patient expired due to COVID-19 illness and one has initiated comfort care measures.",

In addition, with increasing reports of asymptomatic transmission, routine inspection of lung imaging on simulation and cone-beam CT images is strongly encouraged [6-7]. Patients on-treatment were less commonly affected, which may be due to greater precautions to self-quarantine. However, on-treatment patients may also be more difficult to assess given ongoing treatment-related side effects. For example, some of the most common COVID-19 symptoms occur frequently among cancer patients receiving radiotherapy, including sore throat, cough, shortness of breath, and fatigue. Given the difficulty assessing patients on-treatment for COVID-19 related symptoms, we recommend close scrutiny of any new or ambiguous complaints and a low-threshold for viral testing.",

NYPC now requires manufacturer-recommended monthly full-system cleaning after every patient use which typically takes 10 min to perform. Prior to the COVID-19 outbreak, NYPC treated on average four SDX cases per day.

All of the delays at NYPC occurred in the second half of the month, suggesting other cities should expect and prepare for an acceleration of patient events near their projected regional pandemic peak. While most interruptions were of short duration and did not appear clinically meaningful, implementation of these strict policies likely mitigated further patient exposure and more significant treatment delays.
