Recently emerging human viruses, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS\u2010CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS\u2010CoV), Nipah virus, Hendra virus and Ebola virus, are thought be bat\u2010borne viruses (Han et al., 2015). In addition, new species of influenza A viruses, lyssaviruses, paramyxoviruses and coronaviruses continue to be discovered in bats around the world (Tong et al., 2013; Banyard et al., 2014; Yang et al., 2014; Mortlock et al., 2015). Reassortant group A rotavirus was also detected in the faeces of a straw\u2010coloured fruit bat (Esona et al., 2010). Therefore, viruses that originate in bats may be a source of additional spill over from wildlife into domestic animals and humans (Plowright et al., 2015).",

In 1995, there was a report on the isolation and genetic characterization on a hantavirus from bats (Jung and Kim, 1995).

Most Korean bats are thought to be insectivores, as no fruit bats have been found in Korea to date, except for some fruit bats as pets or indoor exhibitions (Han et al., 2010). Through the target\u2010specific RT\u2010PCR, partial RDRP sequences of three alphacoronaviruses (B15\u20108, 40 and 41) and one betacoronavirus (B15\u201021) were detected in the faeces of Korean bats. Bat CoV B15\u20108 was detected in faeces collected at the HO cave where Rhinolophus ferrumequinum and Myotis macrodactylus were the major species. This virus was found to be closely related with Bat CoVs recently found in China and PEDV, a porcine diarrhoeic virus around world. On the other hand, Bat CoVs B15\u201040 and 41 were detected at the BGS cave, where Miniopterus schreibersii was the major species. These sequences were closely related with Bat CoV 1A and 1B, which were reported to have a clear host species restriction to Miniopterus magnate and Miniopterus pusillus in Hong Kong (Chu et al., 2008). As Bat CoVs B15\u201040 and 41 were also found in faeces in a cave where Miniopterus schreibersii was dominant, Bat CoV strains in the same lineage with Bat CoV 1A and 1B may be adapted to the Miniopterus spp.",

The newly identified Bat CoV B15\u201021 clustered with the SARS\u2010CoV\u2010like Bat CoV group in the phylogenetic analysis. The major bat species in the site where Bat CoV B15\u201021 was collected was Rhinolophus ferrumequinum, which is consistent with a previous report that SARS\u2010CoV\u2010like bat CoVs were mostly found in Rhinolophus spp. (Yuan et al., 2010). The amino acids of its full spike gene showed that the B15\u201021 strain is closely related to SARS\u2010CoV\u2010like Bat CoVs Rp3, Rf1, HKU3\u20102 and 273 rather than human SARS\u2010CoVs and Bat CoV RaSHC014, which was reported to have high potential for human emergence (Menachery et al., 2015) and showed two specific deletion sites in the RBD of the spike protein. One additional betacoronavirus (B15\u20101\u20106), which was not detected by the consensus primer\u2010based RDRP\u2010specific RT\u2010PCR (Poon et al., 2005), was detected by high\u2010throughput sequencing as shown in Table 2. Three contigs were similar to Bat CoV SC2013, which is a MERS\u2010related betacoronavirus that was found in bats in China (Yang et al., 2014). One contig was also similar to Bat CoV HKU5\u20105, which clustered with MERS\u2010CoV (Woo et al., 2007; Annan et al., 2013). Phylogenetic analysis based on partial spike gene sequences of Bat CoV B15\u20101\u20106 showed that it belonged to a MERS\u2010CoV\u2010like clade with previously known MERS\u2010CoV and MERS\u2010CoV\u2010like Bat CoVs.",
