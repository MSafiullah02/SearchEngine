Before finalizing, each list was discussed in a meeting between operating room (OR) leads including surgeon, anesthesiologists and nursing manager a day prior. Each specialty was assigned specific operating days and operating rooms for semi-elective cases. The number of OR functioning at any particular day were also reduced to 7 from normal 17 operating rooms; 5 for semi-elective cases and 2 for emergencies. A separate OR suite (normally used for orthopedic surgeries) which is located adjacent but away from the main operating area was dedicated for suspected or confirmed cases of COVID 19.
