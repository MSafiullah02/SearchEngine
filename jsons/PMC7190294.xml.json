They also provide theoretical support for the approach successfully implemented in Wuhan, where fangcang isolation shelters were established for all infected and potentially exposed individuals.5 These shelters provided triage, basic medical care, frequent monitoring, rapid referrals, and essential living and social engagements for the wellbeing of those isolated. Crucially, the fangcang obviated most of the risk of within-household transmission, which frequently occurs as viral loads can be high for mild infections.8 Home-based isolation, which is reliant on personal compliance, will therefore inevitably lead to increased transmission. Although cities within Europe and the USA might not be able to create make-shift isolation centres similar to those in Wuhan, due to a lack of social acceptability or negative public perceptions, other strategies should be considered to reduce transmission, such as repurposing hotels or dormitories. We urge policy makers in countries with or facing overburdened health-care facilities9 to consider such measures as countries emerge from lockdowns.",
