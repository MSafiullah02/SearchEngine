To provide more insight into the prevalence of HAstV gastroenteritis in China, 664 fecal samples were collected from children affected with acute gastroenteritis in Beijing from March 2005 to November 2007. The samples were analyzed genetically. All eight serotypes (genotypes) of HAstVs were screened using RT-PCR assays targeting the ORF2 region in the study. The assays detected HAstVs in 52 (7.8%) of the patients, with HAstV-1 (50/52) being the dominant genotype during the study period. Two minor genotypes, HAstV-6 and HAstV-3, were also detected. Partial sequencing of the 50 HAstV-1 strains showed that the homology of the nucleotide sequence of the ORF1a region between these strains was 88.4-100%, whereas the homology of the amino acid sequences was 95.6-100%. In the ORF2 partial region, the nucleotide identities ranged from 91.5% to 100%, and amino acid identities ranged from 97.3% to 100%. The identity of the whole genome sequence between four randomly examined HAstV-1 strains was 91-99%. No recombination events were observed in HAstVs in this study. The findings of this study will provide baseline data for HAstVs surveillance and control.",

The PCR products were separated on an agarose gel. Subsequently, fragments of 500-1,500 bp in length were excised and purified using the Agarose Gel DNA Purification Kit (TaKaRa). All purified products were cloned into the pMD18-T vector (TaKaRa) and transformed into chemically competent E. coli DH5a. Transformants were randomly selected for DNA sequencing. The sequences were identified by blast analysis against the corresponding HAstV sequences from GenBank (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi). Rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) reactions were performed to obtain the actual 5 0 -and 3 0 -terminal sequences of the viral genome using the 5 0 -and 3 0 -RACE System for Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol.",

None of the nucleotide differences were reflected in amino acid changes in the remaining 37 identified HAstV-1 strains. Among four randomly selected HAstV-1 isolates, the difference of the complete nucleotide sequences were up to maximum of 9%, whereas amino acid differences of the ORF1a, ORF1b, and ORF2 region were 4.8%, 2.9%, and 4.6%, respectively. These data suggest that HAstV-1 was undergoing variation over the period of sample collection in Beijing.",
