            "text": "The goal of ConronaVis is to use tweets as the information shared by the people to visualize topic modeling, study subjectivity and to model the human emotions during the COVID-19 pandemic. The main objective is to explore the psychology and behavior of the societies at large which can assist in managing the economic and social crisis during the ongoing pandemic as well as the after-effects of it. The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic forced people to stay at home to reduce the spread of the virus by maintaining the social distancing. However, social media is keeping people connected both locally and globally. People are sharing information (e.g. personal opinions, some facts, news, status, etc.) on social media platforms which can be helpful to understand the various public behavior such as emotions, sentiments, and mobility during the ongoing pandemic. In this paper, we describe the CoronaVis Twitter dataset (focused on the United States) that we have been collecting from early March 2020. The dataset is available to the research community at https://github.com/mykabir/COVID19. We would like to share this data with the hope that it will enable the community to find out more useful insights and create different applications and models to fight with COVID-19 pandemic, and any future pandemics as well.",

However, over the last couple of months, the virus spread explosively all over the world.

Social distancing is forcing people to stay at home. As a result, this is impacting the public event, business, educations, and almost every other activity of the human life. People are losing their jobs, and getting infected from corona and thus, stress is rising at the personal and at the community levels. Studies of behavioral economics show that emotions (Joy, Anger, Worry, Disgust, Fear, etc.) can deeply affect 1 https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html individual behavior and decision-making. Social networks have the hidden potential to reveal valuable insights on human emotions at the personal and community level. Recent works [1] - [4] show that twitter data, and human emotions analysis can be useful for predicting crimes, stock market, election vote, disaster management, and more. To find out the useful insights from public opinions and shared posts in social media, and to model the public emotions, we have started collecting tweets from 5th March 2020. We have collected and processed over 100 million tweets related to Coronavirus (focused on USA) which is about 700GB data in size. We understand that processing this huge amount of data in real-time requires a substantial amount of time and resources. Hence, we decided to share the processed dataset with the community so that they can skip the raw data processing part and dive into data analytics and modeling.",

The data contains tweets only with the location information as we focused our analysis only on the US data. To keep the privacy, in both our application and in shared data, we introduced some data anonymization. We included tweet ID with the data, hence the researcher can refetch the original tweet if that tweet is still public. However, we respect if a user wants to remove tweets, and to ensure that we processed the tweet text and user name so that that can not be directly searched and linked to a particular user. There are some gaps in the collected datasets due to API and connectivity issues. However, we are filling up those gapes using other publicly available data repositories. We will also perform more data analysis and update this paper with the more updated data and insights.",

In figure 2 , the polarity analysis for New York (NY) states is presented. The CoronaVis application also allows observing the subjectivity analysis of any state in a similar fashion. Figure 3 . We observe that the topic trends became different for different states in USA. To observe how the topic trends are evolving, and what challenges the community are discussing, we have created two different graphs. Figure  4 shows the most frequent topics, and the selected featured topics for New York (NY) state. From the figure, we can observe that the topic test became highly frequent on April 20th, and we can also observe that the topics such as die, death also became popular on the same date.
