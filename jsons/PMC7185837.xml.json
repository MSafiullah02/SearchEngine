            "text": "It is widely agreed that the exposure to ambient air pollution may cause serious respiratory illnesses (Katsouyanni et al., 1996, Navrud, 2001, Aunan and Pan, 2004, Neuberger et al., 2004, Scoggins et al., 2004, Jalaludin et al., 2004, Maynard, 2004, Lee et al., 2009) and that weather conditions may also contribute to the seriousness (Smoyer et al., 2000). Several statistical models have been used to assess the impacts of air quality and weather factors on respiratory illnesses, including simple statistical correlation analysis, regression method, meta-analysis, spatial analysis and nonparametric statistical models such as the generalized additive model (GAM). However, quantifying the effects of various pollutants as well as weather conditions is always a difficult task due to the high unknown nonlinearities on the impact of these environmental and weather factors on the onset of the respiratory illnesses and possible interactions amongst these factors. Nonparametric regression is a powerful tool to model unknown functional relationships. With the consideration of a possible incubative period and/or cumulative effects, we need to consider the lags of potential factors that result in a large number of covariates in the regression. In order to avoid the so-called \u2018curse of dimensions\u2019 referring to the inaccuracy when the multivariate function is estimated nonparametrically, some statistical tools have been developed so as to let the model determine the best combinations in the sense of their contribution to the regression. Representative models include a varying/functional coefficient model (Chen and Tsay, 1993, Hastie and Tibshirani, 1993), regression graphics (Cook, 1998), sliced inverse regression (Li, 1991), single index model (H\u00e4rdle and Stoker, 1989) and multiple index model (Xia et al., 2002). In this paper, we will adopt the multiple index model for our data, following Xia et al. (2002) and Shao et al. (2010).",

            "text": "From the data collected in Hong Kong, we observed an unusual change in the number of respiratory illnesses in early 2003, while all other air quality and weather data were relatively stable. The change coincides with the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (or SARS). The background and severity of this disease is briefed below. SARS is a respiratory disease in humans and is caused by the SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS\u2013CoV). It was first reported in Asia in February 2003. Over the following few months, the disease spread to more than two dozen countries in North America, South America, Europe and Asia before the SARS global outbreak of 2003 was contained. According to the World Health Organization\u2019s (WHO) concluding report on 21 April 2004 (see http://www.who.int/csr/sars/country/table2004_04_21/en/index.html), this major outbreak consisted of 8096 known cases with 774 deaths (a mortality rate of 9.6%). Hong Kong was the most seriously affected area in terms of population size (6.8 million) and land area (1100 km2). There were 1755 cases in total (1 case per 4000 population with 977 females and 778 males) with 299 deaths (a mortality rate of 17%). The source of infection was traced back to an infected Guangzhou professor who arrived in Hong Kong in late February 2003. During his stay in a hotel, the infection was spread to other guests and visitors, subsequently triggering off a chain of outbreaks in Hong Kong, Singapore, Canada and Vietnam. A detailed history and public health experiences can be found in Hong Kong\u2019s SARS Expert Committee Report (2003) and Cheng (2003). The official announcement of the SARS epidemic was on 8 March 2003. The last case was reported on 2 June 2003. After an observation period of 20 days, Hong Kong was removed from the WHO\u2019s list of areas with recent local transmission of SARS on 23 June 2003. The WHO\u2019s research concluded that SARS was spread by close person-to-person contact. SARS\u2013CoV is thought to be transmitted most readily by respiratory droplets of infectious persons when droplets from the cough or sneeze of the infectious persons are propelled a short distance (generally up to 3 ft) through the air and deposited on the mucous membranes of the mouth, nose, or eyes of persons who are nearby. The virus also can be transmitted when a person touches a surface or object contaminated with infectious droplets and then touches his/her mouth, nose, or eye(s). In addition, it is possible that the SARS\u2013CoV might spread more broadly through the air (airborne spread) or by other ways that are not known.",

However, community- or population-based health protection should be another important way to stop the spread of such infectious diseases but has not been addressed seriously before. During the SARS epidemic, Hong Kong\u2019s Department of Health introduced a large-scale health awareness program to publicize the importance of personal and environmental hygiene. The actions included wearing face masks in public by everyone, washing hands regularly (especially before touching mouth and eyes and having food). Official actions included cleaning surfaces in public areas such as handles and buttons with disinfectants regularly, and temperature checks at airports and other immigration ports. An educational campaign for personal and environmental hygiene was widely promoted by TV advertisements and posters in public areas (Leisure Cultural Services Department, 2003, Housing Authority, 2003, Leung et al., 2003). Such public health measures showed great success in controlling the disease. Some measures in public areas have been kept in force until now.",

To check if it is the case, the box-plots of all the variables for each day of the week is given in Fig. 4\n, from which it can be seen that only the number of admitted patients shows some weekly pattern, while all the air pollutants/weather variables show no weekly pattern (in fact, they remain quite constant over the day of the week). Therefore, the weekly pattern in the number of the respiratory illnesses could be modeled together with the pollutants/weather variables.",

            "text": "In order to evaluate the effectiveness of public health measures and air quality on the reduction of respiratory illnesses, with consideration of weekly effect, we consider the following candidate models: (1)Yt=\u03bbt+\u2211k=16\u03b1kDk,t+g(X)+\u03b5t with (2)\u03bbt={0,if t\u2264tstart,\u03be1+\u03be31+exp{\u2212\u03be2(t\u2212\u03be4)}if t\u2265tend. The individual terms in the model are considered as follows. (i) \u03b5t is a zero-mean, constant variance error term. (ii) \u03bbt measures the impact of public health measures with \u03be1 and \u03be3 being real values representing the lower and upper asymptotes, respectively, \u03be2 being a positive value representing the growth rate and \u03be4 being a real value representing the time of maximum growth. That is, the effect of public health measures as measured by the shift in the total number of illnesses. By noting the magnitude of impact decreases eventually over time due to many factors including behavioral and memory dynamics, the growth curves are widely used in psychological research to model the changes over time (Mcardle and Nesselroade, 2002). The logistic growth curve is a special case of the generalized Richard growth curve (Richard, 1959). A negative value of \u03be1 indicates a reduction of the number of illnesses, meaning an effective impact of public health measures. A positive value of \u03be3 means that the impact of public health measures will fade and vanish over time. We do not use the full Richard curve because it involves complicated computing due to a limit or embedded cases (Shao, 2002) and the special case here is good enough to fit the data. Bear in mind that we do not use the data during the SARS epidemic as it is highly unstable. (iii) Due to the hospital system in Hong Kong where only emergency departments are in normal service during weekends, the effect of the day-of-the-week is indicated in previous studies (Xia et al., 2002, Xia and Tong, 2006). Here the dummy variables are defined as Dk,t={1,t is the kth day in the week ,0Otherwise, with day 1 to 6 referring to Saturday to Thursday respectively and Friday as the reference day. The second term measures the effect of the day-of-the-week which is also important (Dominici et al., 2000, Forster De and Solomon, 2003, Bruckmann and Wichmann-Fiebig, 1997, Xia and Tong, 2006). (iv) The effect of environmental and weather factors on the illnesses is characterized by a Multiple Index Model defined as (3)g(X)=g(\u03b211X1+\u22ef+\u03b2p1Xp,\u2026,\u03b21MX1+\u22ef+\u03b2pMXp)=g(XB) with M<p and E(\u03b5|X)=0 almost surely. Here g() is an unknown smooth function and B=(\u03b21,\u2026,\u03b2M) is the coefficient matrix with \u03b2j=(\u03b21j,\u2026\u03b2pj)T being the jth direction or components, ()Tdenotes the transpose of a vector or matrix. Without loss of generality, the standardized version of X=(X1,\u2026,Xp) is used in the model, i.e. E(Xj)=0 and Var(Xj)=1(j=1,\u2026,p). To ensure the uniqueness of the coefficient matrix, one should impose some identification condition on B. Usually it is assumed that BTB=IM\u00d7M, that is, B is an orthogonal matrix.",

The name MAVE is given in light of the following equation (5)E{Y\u2212E(Y|XB)}2=E[E{Y\u2212E(Y|XB)}2|XB]=\u03c3XB2, where the last term is the conditional variance with a given XB. There are two conditional expectations we need to deal with. Assume that there are n observations Yi with corresponding covariates Xi=(X1,i,\u2026,Xp,i)(i=1,2,\u2026,n). For any given X0=(X1,0,\u2026,Xp,0), the inner expectation at X0 can be approximated by a local linear expansion of E(Yi|XiB). That is (6)E(Yi|XiB)\u2248\u03bbti+\u2211k=16\u03b1kDk,ti+a+(Xi\u2212X0)BbT, where a=g(X0B) and b=\u2202g(V)/\u2202V evaluated at V=X0B. Note that the outer conditional expectation is in fact the conditional variance with a given XB. Following the idea of local linear smooth estimation, we can estimate \u03c3XB2 by exploiting the approximation (7)\u2211i=1nwi0{Yi\u2212E(Yi|XiB)}2\u2248\u2211i=1nwi0[Yi\u2212{\u03bbti+\u2211k=16\u03b1kDk,ti++a+(Xi\u2212X0)BbT}]2, where wi0\u22650 are some weights with \u2211i=1nwi0=1. Usually kernel smoothing is employed by defining the weights as (8)wi0=Kh{(Xi\u2212X0)B}/\u2211l=1nKh{(Xl\u2212X0)B}, where Kh(\u2022)=hDKh(\u2022/h) with D being the dimension of kernel function K(\u2022) and h the bandwidth. On the basis of the above approximation of conditional expectations, the MAVE estimate of the coefficient matrix B is obtained by solving the minimization (9)minB:BTB=I{\u2211j=1n\u03c3\u02c6XjB2}=minB:BTB=Iaj,bj,j=1,\u2026,n(\u2211j=1n\u2211i=1nwij[Yi\u2212{\u03bbi+\u2211k=16\u03b1kDk,ti+aj+(Xi\u2212Xj)BbjT}]2), where bj=(bj1,\u2026,bjD) is a row vector. Note that the constraint BTB=I makes the above minimization more difficult. Furthermore, the weights depend on the choice of coefficient matrix B. We can use an iteration procedure to find the solution. A suggested stop rule for B is m(B(t\u22121),B(t))=\u2016{I\u2212B(t\u22121)(B(t\u22121))T}B(t)\u2016<\u03b4 and |\u03bbi(t)\u2212\u03bbi(t\u22121)|<\u03b4, where \u03b4 is a predetermined tolerance value.",

To do this, we first obtain the ordered bootstrap estimates {\u03be11\u2217,\u2026,\u03be1R\u2217} derived from the bootstrap resampling method. The two-sided confidence interval at level \u03b1 is then given by [\u03be1R(\u03b1/2)\u2217,\u03be1R(1\u2212\u03b1/2)\u2217].

The shape and 95% confidence limits of the growth curve which model the effect of SARS over time is given in Fig. 5\nwhich clearly shows the significance of the public health measure due to the SARS outbreak on the number of administration.

Following (Xia et al., 2002, Shao et al., 2010), we regard coefficients with absolute value greater than 0.1 as significant coefficients. With this rationale, a simple way to interpret the results is to look for coefficients larger than 0.1. Let us call these coefficients as large coefficients. Bear in mind that the first dimension accounts the most contribution to the model. We can see that SO2, temperature and humidity are important factors for diseases, compared with NO2 and OZ which have moderate contributions. The RSP and NOx are less important to the respiratory diseases in Hong Kong. The second dimension is set to model the variance which is not included in the first dimension. We can see that for the second dimension, SO2, NOx and Humidity are the major factors and RSP still does not show its importance. For the third dimension, all the factors show similar importance except humidity which has no coefficient larger than 0.1.",

This can be confirmed by the summary statistics in Table 3. The model with change has smaller residuals with smaller standard deviation for the overall data, the data before SARS and the data after SARS. For the model with change, the summary statistics do not show any trend when the data are splitinto two part (before and after SARS).

The model consists of three additive parts: the nonparametric multiple index model part takes account of the impact of pollutants and climatic factors, a growth curve after the SARS outbreak models the impact due to public health measures and a categorical variable models the weekly effect. The data from Hong Kong are used for this study as the 2003 SARS epidemic initiated a change of public health measures in the community due to government effort and public awareness. In addition, another possible driving force for maintaining individual hygiene habits during the epidemic was the power of the media. During the time of the SARS epidemic, all media (including newspapers, radio and TV) reported daily death cases due to SARS. This was probably a most effective way to alert people of the dreadful disease and the importance of having good hygienic habits. It was well observed that during the SARS period the people of Hong Kong followed the advice of the government on hygienic measures closely, such as wearing face masks in the public, washing hands frequently, avoiding going to the public in case of having a flu, etc. The effects of pollutants and climatic factors on respiratory diseases are complicated due to the latent effect, nonlinearity and interactions between factors. The multiple index model is used to model such complicated relationship due to it flexibility and ability of handling a large number of dependent variables. The results provide indirect quantitative support to the governmental awareness program during the outbreak of the epidemic, and also the effectiveness of the media in disease control. Another important observation, however, is that the growth curve starts to increase sharply near the end of 2003 (see Fig. 5), and has flattened before mid-2004. This means that the number of illnesses had reverted to pre-SARS levels in about 6 months\u2019 time. This in turn reflects the forgetfulness of Hong Kong people, or people in many large cities. Large city people are occupied with many attractions, when the immediate threat of an epidemic fades, their alertness will wane fast. The media\u2019s interest in the epidemic is also short-lived if it does not continue to cause casualties. This suggests strongly that public health organizations and officers have to frequently remind people to keep up with their hygienic habits, so as to minimize the damage of infectious diseases.",

Although it is possible to restrict the growth curve function to the maximum of zero by letting \u03be3\u2264\u2212\u03be1, it is not a good exercise to implement such a restriction before clearer understanding of the short upward trend. Furthermore, our model setting has no problem to include more parametric terms such as a linear function of time for long-term trends.",
