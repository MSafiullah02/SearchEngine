Lethal sepsis is commonly arising from bacterial CAP, often leading to SRF and the need for MV. The peculiar clinical course of CAP caused by SARS-CoV-2, including the sudden deterioration of the clinical condition 7-8 days after the first symptoms, generates the hypothesis that this illness is driven by a unique pattern of immune dysfunction that is likely different from sepsis.

We investigated whether this classification might apply to patients with SRF caused by SARS-CoV-2. Results revealed that approximately one fourth of patients with SRF have MAS and that most patients suffer from immune dysregulation dominated by low expression of HLA-DR on CD14 monocytes, which is triggered by monocyte hyperactivation, excessive release of interleukin-6 (IL-6), and profound lymphopenia.

Patients with bacterial CAP were screened for participation in a large-scale randomized clinical trial with the acronym PROVIDE (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03332225). Patients with 2009 H1N1 influenza have been described in previous publications of our group (Giamarellos-Bourboulis et al., 2009; Raftogiannis et al., 2010) . The clinical characteristics of patients with bacterial CAP and CAP caused by COVID-19 are described in Table 1 . Each cohort (bacterial sepsis and COVID-19) is split into patients who developed SRF and required MV and those who did not. Three main features need to be outlined: (1) patients with COVID-19 and SRF are less severe than those with severe bacterial CAP, on the basis of the traditional severity scores of sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) and acute physiology and chronic health evaluation (APACHE) II; (2) this leads to the conclusion that COVID-19 patients undergo an acute immune dysregulation with deterioration into SRF before the overall state of severity is advanced; and (3) although the burden of co-morbidities of patients with COVID-19, as expressed by the Charlson's co-morbidity index, is higher among patients with SRF than among patients without SRF, it remains remarkably lower that traditional bacterial CAP and sepsis. It was also notable that the admission values of Glasgow Coma Scale scores of patients with bacterial CAP were 8.80 \u00b1 4.76, and that of patients with COVID-19 was 14.71 \u00b1 0.20 (p < 0.0001).

This also happens in immune dysregulation caused by SARS-CoV-2 ( Figures 1A and 1B) . Although patients with bacterial-CAP-associated MAS also have decreased HLA-DR molecules on CD14 monocytes, their circulating ferritin is significantly higher than normal. This is a feature found only in a few patients with SARS-CoV-2 and MAS ( Figure 1C ). The absence of traits of MAS among cases of SARS-CoV-2 with immune dysregulation is further proven by the low scores of hemophagocytosis (HS). HScore is proposed as a classification tool for secondary MAS, and values more than 169 are highly diagnostic (Fardet et al., 2014) . Seven patients with SARS-CoV-2 had HS above this cut-off, and all were properly classified by using ferritin (Figure 1D ). Among patients with bacterial CAP at an intermediate immune state, the number of molecules of HLA-DR on their CD14 monocytes was lower than in healthy patients. However, patients with pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2 at an intermediate immune state maintained their number of molecules of HLA-DR on CD14 monocytes much closer to the healthy condition.

Indeed, production of tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a) by LPS-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of patients with bacterial CAP classified for immunoparalysis was significantly lower than in patients at an intermediate state ( Figure 4A ). That was not the case for patients with pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2, in whom PBMCs showed sustained TNF-a production after stimulation with LPS ( Figure 4B ). The function of PBMCs in patients with SRF caused by 2009H1N1 was also impaired, and there was lower TNF-a production, a pattern different from COVID-19 patients ( Figure 4C) . Surprisingly, stimulation of IL-1b was lower among patients with immune dysregulation than among patients with an intermediate immune state (Figures 4D-4F) . IL-6, however, followed the stimulation pattern of TNF-a ( Figures 4G-4I) .

IFN-g was below the limit of detection in all patients (data not shown), indicating that Th1 responses do not contribute to over-inflammation. No differences of circulating TNF-a concentrations were found between COVID-19 patients at the three states of immune classification (Figure 4J ). In contrast, IL-6 and CRP concentrations were significantly higher among patients with immune dysregulation than among patients at an intermediate state of immune activation ( Figures 4K and 4L ). Given that IL-6 was below the limit of detection in some patients with immune dysregulation, we divided them into two groups as follows: seven patients with IL-6 below the limit of detection and 14 patients with detectable IL-6. Their severity was similar given that SOFA score and pneumonia severity indexes were similar (p values of comparisons were 0.937 and 0.877, respectively; data not shown). IL-6 is known to inhibit HLA-DR expression (Ohno et al., 2016) , leading to the hypothesis that IL-6 over-production mediates the low HLA-DR expression on CD14 monocytes of COVID-19 patients. In agreement with this, negative correlation was found between serum amounts of IL-6 and the absolute number of HLA-DR molecules on CD14 monocytes of patients with COVID-19 but also between the absolute lymphocyte count and the absolute number of mHLA-DR on CD14 monocytes of patients with COVID-19 ( Figures 5A and 5B) . Furthermore, PBMCs from patients with immune dysregulation were cultured overnight in the presence of plasma of the COVID-19 patients, which was already shown to be rich in IL-6. The expression of HLA-DR on CD14 monocytes was strongly inhibited by COVID-19 plasma from patients with immune dysregulation but not by plasma from patients with an intermediate immune state of activation ( Figures 5C-5F ); the addition of the specific blocker of the IL-6 pathway Tocilizumab partially restored the expression of HLA-DR on monocytes of all patients with immune dysregulation (Figures 5E and 5F ).
