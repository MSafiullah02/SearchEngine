Many of the coronaviruses were recognized as viruses typically causing pneumonia and colds until the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2002 and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012 from zoonotic sources [2]. In addition, a novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), causing severe acute respiratory disease emerged recently in Wuhan, China in December 2019 [3,4]. Like the other two highly pathogenic coronaviruses SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 can also cause severe respiratory illness and even death. Moreover, the population's susceptibility to these highly pathogenic coronaviruses has contributed to large outbreaks and evolved into the public health events, highlighting the necessity to prepare for the future emerging viruses [5].",

            "text": "Similar to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 spreads rapidly among humans and likely originates in bats [3,6]. The initial patient cluster with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection was reported as pneumonia with unknown aetiology, which bore some resemblance to both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infections and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality. Moreover, patients requiring ICU admission had higher concentrations of G-CSF, IP-10, MCP-1, MIP-1A, and TNF-\u03b1 than did those not requiring ICU admission, suggesting that the cytokine storm was associated with disease severity [7]. To date the severity of SARS-CoV-2 has tended to be mild, the risk of fatality among hospitalized cases was 4.3% in a single-center case series of 138 hospitalized patients [8], and the infection fatality risk could be below 1% or even below 0.1% in a large number of undetected relatively mild infections [9]. However, the basic reproduction number (R0) of person-to-person spread was about 2.6, which meant that the cases of infection would grow at an exponential rate. As of 7 February, 2020, 57,620 cases of SARS-CoV-2 have been reported in China, including 26,359 suspected cases, and a sustained increase is predicted. It is challenging to judge the severity and predict the consequences of the information available to date. Since no specific antiviral treatment for SARS-CoV-2 infection is currently available, supportive cares, including symptomatic controls and prevention of complications remain the most important management strategy, especially in preventing acute respiratory distress syndrome [4,10]. Currently, there is no special antiviral treatment or vaccine against the new virus. Therefore, it is of great importance to research and develop effective and safe antiviral drugs.",

            "text": "It has been reported that many traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) prescriptions could not only inhibit the replication of virus directly, but also attenuate excessive pro-inflammatory responses and tissue damage by viruses [[11], [12], [13]]. Therefore, it is significantly to study the traditional Chinese medicines that have obvious advantages in the treatment of the new virus. Liu Shen capsule (LS), a traditional Chinese medicine, has been used to treat influenza, tonsillitis, pharyngitis, and mumps for more than a century [14]. It consists of Bezoar (the gall-stone of Bos taurus domesticus Gmelin), Musk (the excretion of Moschus), cinobufagin venom toad (the excretion of Venenum Bufonis), pearl (the shell of Pernulo), realgar, and borneol. In previous studies, it was shown that the LS exhibited a wide spectrum of pharmacological properties, such as anti-inflammatory, anticancer, antiviral, analgesic, antibacterial, and immunomodulatory activities [15,16]. In addition, LS could inhibit viral propagation and regulate immune function and achieved similar therapeutic effectiveness with oseltamivir in reducing the course of H1N1 virus infection. Notably, the anti-influenza activity of LS in infected mice might depend on the regulation of cytokines, particularly in cytokine storm associated cytokines, such as IFN-\u03b3, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1 [17]. However, there is no exact evidence that LS is effective in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 and its mechanisms of action remain obscure. Therefore, to study the antiviral activity of LS on SARS-CoV-2 and its potential effect in regulating the host\u2019s immune response, we evaluated the antiviral and anti-inflammatory efficiency of LS against a clinical isolate of SARS-CoV-2 from Guangzhou in vitro.",

For this sudden and lethal disease, no specific antiviral drugs or vaccines have been developed, and supportive care and non-specific treatment of patients are currently the only options to ameliorate the symptoms [[28], [29], [30]]. Therefore, effective and safe antiviral agents are urgently needed. Currently, the use of TCM is a popular and acceptable therapy, and many TCM prescriptions have been proven to have obvious therapeutic effect on the virus by inhibiting the replication of the virus directly and improving the immune functions of the host organism. It may be a potential effective drug source for new drug discovery. LS is a TCM used to treat tonsillitis, influenza, pharyngitis, and mumps. However, the antiviral and anti-inflammatory effects induced by SARS-CoV-2 and the potential mechanisms of LS in treating viral pneumonia are less understood. Therefore, the potential antiviral and anti-inflammatory activities of LS induced by SARS-CoV-2 were investigated. In the present study, it was the first time to clarify that LS could not only inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection, but also significantly suppress the inflammation caused by SARS-CoV-2 through a mechanism that involved the downregulation of inflammatory cytokines.",

The results showed that LS was able to protect cells from virus-induced cell death and inhibit the average size and plaque number in LS-treated cells in a dose-dependent manner. The SI index of LS reached 8.18 (Table 1). All these results confirmed that LS might be a potential antiviral drug for SARS-CoV-2. TEM has been a potent tool to observe virus entry, virus particle assembly, viral ultrastructure, and budding from the plasma membrane [31]. To understand the antiviral details of LS, TEM images were taken from each group (Fig. 3). Abundant virus particles assembled at the surface of the membrane, cytoplasm, and plasma vesicles in cells infected with SARS-CoV-2, decreased with the treatment of LS at 2.00 \u03bcg/mL.",

            "text": "It is reported that highly pathogenic coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV cause fatal pneumonia, which is mainly associated with rapid virus replication, massive inflammatory cell infiltration and elevated proinflammatory cytokine/chemokine responses. Although the pathophysiology of fatal pneumonia caused by highly pathogenic coronaviruses has not been completely understood, recent studies suggest a crucial role of cytokine storm in causing fatal pneumonia [32]. Early studies have shown that increased amounts of proinflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, CXCL-10/IP-10, and CCL-2/MCP-1) in the serum of SARS patients [33], which was similar to the serum patients with MERS with increased concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines (i.e., IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1, IL-15, and IL-17) [34]. It also reported that the expression of the cytokine storm in the NCIP patients in ICU than those in non-ICU patients [7]. Therefore, the mRNA and protein production of IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, CCL-2/MCP-1, CXCL-10/IP-10, IL-6 and IL-8 induced by SARS-CoV-2 was detected. The results showed that LS inhibited the release of IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, CCL-2/MCP-1, CXCL-10/IP-10, IL-6 and IL-8 induced by SARS-CoV-2 in Huh-7 cells (Fig. 4, Fig. 5) in a dose-dependent manner. The change of cytokine profiles suggested that LS might have a potential effect on the inhibition of the cytokine storm induced by SARS-CoV-2.",

            "text": "Since the SARS syndrome is characterized by an uncontrolled inflammatory response and NF-\u03baB is the major transcription factor activated in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [35]. Similar to SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 can also cause severe respiratory illness and even death. NF-\u043aB plays an important role in mediating inflammation, immune responses, and other cellular activities [36]. Activation of NF-\u043aB can induce cytokines production, and these cytokines can react upon in turn and they produce a positive autoregulatory loop and exacerbate the inflammatory response [37]. Therefore, to understand the molecular mechanism of LS against virus infection, the regulation of the NF-\u043aB/MAPK signaling pathway contributes to the alleviation of inflammation. The results showed that SARS-CoV-2 activated the NF-\u043aB /MAPK signaling pathway and LS could significantly decrease SARS-CoV-2-induced activation of p-NF-\u03baB p65, p-I\u03baB\u03b1, and p-p38 MAPK and increase the expression of the I\u03baB\u03b1 (Fig. 5). We inferred that the underlying mechanism of LS is to impair the upregulated proinflammatory cytokines induced by SARS-CoV-2 via inhibiting the activity of NF-\u043aB/MAPK signaling pathway. The change of cytokine profiles suggested that LS might have a potential effect on the inhibition of cytokine storm induced by SARS-CoV-2.",

These findings warrant further evaluation of LS as a potential agent for SARS-CoV-2 treatment and provide information to further reveal the mechanisms. LS may be an effective anti-inflammatory agent and can be used to treat the inflammation induced by SARS-CoV-2.",
