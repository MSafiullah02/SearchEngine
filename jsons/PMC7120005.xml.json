A high viscosity will result in irregular sample migration through the column with subsequent loss of resolution and, in some instances, will reduce the column flow rate.

Luteinising hormone (LH) was purified 46-fold from a crude pituitary extract by gel-filtration on two Sephacryl S-200 columns. The method exploited differential binding of LH (in the crude extract) to blue dextran for the first chromatography step. Before the second step, addition of high salt released LH from the blue dextran, enabling effective purification (4). Fusion ferritin (heavy-chain ferritin plus light-chain ferritin) has also been purified by urea-gradient gel-filtration. In this case, fusion ferritin solubilised from inclusion bodies with 4 M urea was applied to the column. Refolding enhancers were included in the urea-diluent buffer that was subsequently applied to the column to produce properly folded fusion ferritin multimers (5).",

Various problems, however, have limited the development of gel-filtration methods for oligosaccharides. First, many of the commercially available gel-filtration matrices are themselves carbohydrates (e.g. Sephadex, Sepharose, etc., manufactured by GE Healthcare), shedding milligram quantities of heterodisperse carbohydrate polymers into the mobile phase. Second, non-specific interactions with matrix materials are common, since sugars are essentially amphipathic with a hydrophobic ring structure and hydrophilic functional groups. Despite these problems, however, gel-filtration chromatography still remains an important option for the purification of complex oligosaccharides.",

Size-exclusion reaction chromatography (SERC) permits one to control the extent of a reaction (such as PEGylation) that alters molecular size and to separate reactants and products. In SERC, injection of reactants onto a size-exclusion chromatography column forms a moving reaction zone. Reactants and products partition differently within the mobile phase, leading to different flow rates through the column. Thus, products are removed selectively from the reaction zone, shortening their residence time in the reaction zone and separating them into the downstream section of the column. In PEGylation, addition of PEG groups to the protein significantly increases molecular size, allowing the use of SERC to obtain a dominant final PEGylated protein size in high yield. The principle was successfully demonstrated using two model proteins, alpha-lactalbumin and beta-lactoglobulin (21).",
