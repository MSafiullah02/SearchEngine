            "text": "In December 2019, a cluster of patients with unknown pneumonia was reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China [1\u20133]. After the epidemiological survey and genome sequencing analysis, a novel coronavirus was identified [4]. The International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) announced it as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) [5], and the World Health Organization (WHO) announced that the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 was coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Within 2 months, it had spread to different areas and countries. As of February 8, 2020, more than 30,000 cases of laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were reported around the world, including 25 confirmed cases in the area of Luoyang, Henan Province, China. SARS-CoV-2 can cause severe respiratory illness, similar to SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and has been found to be adept at human-to-human transmission [2, 6]. China launched an emergency response to the outbreak, and the WHO also declared it a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC). In the case of SARS-CoV-2, there have been some clues suggesting that, sometimes, an individual with highly severe SARS-CoV-2 disease will only cause a few infections; conversely, individuals with a moderate disease or latent infection can occasionally cause many infections [7].",

Patients were diagnosed with COVID-19 based on the WHO interim guidance [8]. A patient confirmed to have SARS-CoV-2 was defined as a positive case according to a PCR assay using nasal and pharyngeal swab specimens [1]. PCR results were obtained after a 1- to 3-day delay and were then used to identify confirmed cases. Of the 25 patients, three had severe conditions, and the others had moderate conditions. Ten patients underwent follow-up CT, and the lung lesions of two people improved, whereas eight of them gradually absorbed after experiencing consolidation changing. Patients were divided into three groups according to the CT scanning timing after the onset of patients\u2019 symptoms: group 1, \u2264 7 days; group 2, 8\u201314 days; and group 3, 14\u201321 days.

Figures 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 show some typical and significant CT image findings. In the early stage, there were usually no abnormal findings on chest images or only small patchy shadows in the peripheral lung field, which could be clearly observed after the progression of the disease. In this stage, thin patchy GGO was seen on the CT, distributed along the bronchial vascular bundle, as well as thickening adjacent to the bronchial wall. As shown in Figs. 5 and 6, multiple nucleic acid assays were negative at this point, while subsequent CT manifestations revealed significant lesions with progression, and PCR results were also positive, reflecting the positive CT results for lesions at the same time. Common CT performance for bilateral lung multiple patchy ground glass opacity (GGO) and/or consolidation shadows could be accompanied by bronchial distribution of the blood vessel bundle, but the major distribution was in subpleural areas. Part of the lesion within the fine mesh shadow, halo sign or reversed halo sign could be seen in the visible edge (Fig. 4). Disease progression after the consolidation of the GGO could result in partial or complete consolidation (Fig. 3). The lesions were mainly distributed in the subpleural and oblique crack regions. Air bronchogram signs were common in consolidation shadows. The partial bronchi wall was thickened. Small blood vessels with fine reticular structures increased in the lesion. As shown in Figs. 2, 4, and 6, during the dissipation period, lesion scope and density decreased. The GGO shadow was partially or completely absorbed. A partial fibrotic stripe shadow was observed in the fusion and consolidation lesions during this period. The shadow in the lung did not completely disappear before the nucleic acid assay was negative (Fig. 2).",

However, the interlobular septal was rarely thickened, and thickening and traction bronchiectasis occurred during the disease progression or repair period. These CT findings are in line with the two studies [10, 11]. On the other hand, Shi reported obvious cystic changes, which were not shown in our study [12]. The differences could be related to the individual differences and the severity of the illness. Notably, we did not find gravity distribution, tree-bud pattern, cavernous, or cystic airspaces in the CT images. The central interstitium is rarely affected except in serious patients. In addition, COVID-19 patients were not found to have combined infections with bacteria and fungi in our studies and other studies [13]. These features could be considered key identification points from other viral pneumonia.",

However, PCR as a diagnostic standard has the following problems. The shortage of PCR reagents and detectability delayed the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2. Sometimes different brands of reagents would have different results. PCR tests should be collected and detected by experienced clinical technicians and detected by approved clinical laboratories, which limits its usage and is difficult to implement in basic hospitals. When the virus load was low in the early infection, it was hard to detect, and the potential for false negative results needs to be considered and carefully controlled in PCR experiments [16]. Most importantly, PCR cannot reflect the severity and progression of pneumonia, while CT imaging could support this vacancy. PCR tests showed false negative results in our study, which is consistent with previous studies [10, 11]. In addition, since PCR results required a 1- to 3-day delay and then identified patients as confirmed cases, chest CT manifestations could appear earlier than viral nucleic acid assay in some cases. It is reasonable that CT could reflect the progression of the diseases and was of great importance in the early diagnosis and isolation of suspected patients.",
