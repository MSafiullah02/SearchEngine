Design: A QUAL-qual mixed method design, using grounded theory as the core method and ethnographic strategies are used to inform the cultural aspects of the study. Sample: A purposeful sample of 19 Chinese elderly was interviewed and tape recorded. Four traditional Chinese Practitioners were also interviewed. Methods: The interviews were transcribed and analyzed in Chinese and later translated into English. Data analysis utilized the constant comparison method. Results: Participants experienced a 5-stage process of protecting self, family, and others, responding according to the perceived threat of SARS. Participants used both Western and traditional Chinese strategies to combat SARS. Their desire to protect others took precedence under the moral code of filial piety. Once SARS was under control, the community remained vigilant and continued to monitor for its possible reoccurrence. Conclusions: Cultural beliefs and practices within the Chinese population support the recommendations set by the health department for the protection of individuals and the community during the SARS pandemic. Therefore, the public health sector should become familiar with and support these Chinese cultural networks during pandemics.",

            "text": "In February 2003, the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic occurred worldwide, and by March it had become a reality in Canada. The disease threatened the entire country and primarily affected the Chinese communities in Toronto. Medical and epidemiological research on infectious diseases including SARS generally focused on the identification of the pathogens (Drosten et al., 2003) , understanding of its mode of transmission (Ksiazek et al., 2003; Peiris, Yuen, Osterhaus, & St\u00f6hr, 2003) and the spread, treatment, and the clinical course of the disease (Lee et al., 2003) . The causative agent for SARS is now confirmed to be a novel coronavirus and the predominant mode of its transmission is speculated to be large droplets or close or direct contact (Seto et al., 2003; Varia et al., 2003) . To date, there is still no definitive treatment for SARS as its pathogenesis is still under investigation (Booth et al., 2003; Ho, 2003) . Because of the speed of transmission with air travel, even though there were no diagnosed cases of SARS reported in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, it is important to understand how communities responded and what preventive and protective strategies they used to combat SARS and to control the spread of the disease. This information may be incorporated into program to prevent uncontrolled pandemics in the future.",

This physician became the index patient and infected 11 others staying in the same hotel. These index patients in turn carried SARS to Vietnam, Singapore, Ireland, Canada, and the United States (Wenzel & Edmond, 2003) . The World Health Organization (WHO) declared SARS an evolving epidemic with 3,169 confirmed cases and 144 deaths (WHO, 2003) with a reported mortality rate of 4.9% (Wenzel & Edmond, 2003) . SARS was reported and confirmed in Canada early March 2003 (Naylor, Chantler, & Griffiths, 2004) in five members of a multigenerational family of Chinese descent living in Toronto (Poutanen et al., 2003) . The Canadian index patient stayed on the same floor at the same hotel as the index patient from Hong Kong. She was managed at home by her family doctor after she developed flu-like symptoms and she died 3 days later. This patient's son who lived in the same house was admitted to hospital with pneumonia-like symptoms, and he later died of multiorgan failure with a retrospective diagnosis of SARS (Poutanen et al., 2003) . This was the first wave of SARS infection, in which five patients and almost 100 health care professionals were infected in three different hospitals in the Greater Toronto Area. The second wave of SARS infection in Canada occurred between April and June 2003 with a reported 74 cases of SARS at the North York General Hospital, which resulted in 90 confirmed SARS cases and more than 9,000 affected . These two epidemic waves of SARS resulted in a total of 251 probable and 187 suspected SARS cases and 43 deaths in Canada (St. John et al., 2005) .",

One studied factors influencing the practice of preventive behaviors among Chinese elderly (Tang & Wong, 2005) and the other investigated the level of knowledge and prevention against SARS among a group of elderly Chinese living in a nursing home in Hong Kong (Tse, Pun, & Benzie, 2003) . Both studies involved interviewing a group of Chinese elderly to elicit their knowledge of SARS and their use of strategies against the disease. Tang and Wong (2005) reported that elderly who perceived greater vulnerability to SARS and those with a lower education level had more confidence in the health authority and were more likely to adopt the recommended strategies against SARS. Tse et al. (2003) did not investigate the type of strategies utilized by these elderly, and reported that the knowledge base of these elderly was extremely limited. Of the remaining two studies, Kong et al. (2003) addressed the importance of prevention and early diagnosis of SARS in the elderly population. Kong and his colleagues discussed the difficulties of diagnosing SARS in the elderly population and stressed the need to maintain proper surveillance strategies in the communities. Chung (2003) reported that Chinese elderly who lived alone and those with chronic diseases were more worried about contracting SARS. The majority of elderly in her study were fearful of becoming victims to SARS, and this fear was compounded by uncertainty.",

Fifteen of the 19 participants in this study lived with either their children or their spouses, and these living arrangements prompted them to take the responsibility to protect their family members by learning everything about protection and prevention against SARS. Further, the concept of filial piety goes beyond the obligation of showing respect to one's parents. It is seen as an ethical principle that directs one's interpersonal relationships toward one's family and others in the community. In this case, filial piety suggested the ''right and humane'' way to act toward one's family and others in the community, and guided the Chinese elderly in their use of strategies against SARS. Therefore, filial piety was two-tiered: what is expected of the participants at a personal level (to protect their families) and at a societal level (to undergo voluntary isolation upon return from Hong Kong). These actions were understandable because of the serious consequences of contracting SARS. There is no question that the use of protective and preventive strategies against SARS among Chinese elderly was clearly driven and influenced by filial piety, and that concept was central to this study. The Chinese elderly were so frightened of spreading SARS to their families and others that they took all effort to make sure they would not spread the disease, as they would not be able to live with themselves. In addition to using Confucianism, participants utilized fatalism and destiny to explain the unexplainable events. This provided explanation and comfort to the participants to explain the deaths of health care professionals. Participants were all proactive and engaged in all strategies against SARS, but enlisted extra protection from deities at the same time. Their main concerns were for the well being of family and community, and these were the motives behind the initiation of all protective and preventive strategies against SARS.",

The use of food is influenced by TCM, where foods are categorized either ying ( ) (cool) or yang ( ) (hot) class based on the food constituents. This explained the consumption of liang ( ) (cool) foods by the participants during the SARS outbreak, as it was believed that SARS virus prolifer-ated more rapidly under the yang ( ) (hot) body system. There were also differences on the types of herbs used by the participants. Those who were in Hong Kong during the SARS outbreak consumed ban lan gen ( ) (Isatis indigotica), a herb that is considered extremely liang ( ) (cool) in nature. Ban lan gen ( ) (Isatis indigotica) was recommended by traditional Chinese practitioners in Hong Kong (Leung, 2004; Leung & Ooi, 2003) for the prevention of SARS. However, individuals who were in Edmonton used herbs that were less liang ( ) (cool) in nature such as chrysanthemum and kam gan fa ( ), because ban lan gen ( ) (Isatis indigotica) might not be suitable for everyone. The use of different types of herbs is based on the knowledge of contagion of SARS as a type of Wan Bing ( ) (febrile disease) from the TCM perspective. SARS was considered a reemerging disease that often occurred during (cusp) seasonal changes with extreme weather. Although the use of herbal medicines was recommended by TCM practitioners for the prevention of SARS, only participants who were in Hong Kong at the time of the epidemics actually consumed them. All other participants in the study consumed foods that possessed cooling effects and that were believed to place the body in a better position to fight the disease. The consumption of herbs or foods by the participants depended entirely on whether or not they had been abroad in a SARSinfected country. The use of herbs was discussed with TCM practitioners, and this again reflected participants' concern about the benefits and risks of the use of herbs versus the use of food for prevention of diseases including SARS. Knowledge about the use of herbs and food to prevent diseases had been culturally acquired by these Chinese elders. They were not able to explain how they attained the knowledge, but tended to believe that it was part of their experience when they were growing up. Participants were knowledgeable about the use of both Western and TCM strategies against SARS, based on the recommendations of the various health authorities and their own knowledge of food therapy. Participants' use of both Western and TCM strategies was a course of action aimed at putting themselves in the best position to combat the disease.",

In particular, public health nurses should explore the cultural components of minority groups to better understand and support the use of additional disease prevention strategies based on the health beliefs of these groups. Understanding the contagion of diseases from the individual's cultural perspective is vital if one is to provide education about the use of specific strategies in preventing the spread of diseases. Strategies recommended by health authorities must be congruent with the health beliefs of the minority group in order to encourage adherence to protocols for control of infectious diseases in the future. We trust that this study exemplifies the importance of incorporating culture as a means of revealing and interpreting responses to an urgent and immediate threat to health. A comparative study involving Chinese elderly from different countries would be valuable, as factors affecting the use of strategies against SARS and similar infectious diseases may differ in other regions.",
