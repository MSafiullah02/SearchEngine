The angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) was identified as a functional receptor for SARS-CoV (Li et al., 2003).

            "text": "SARS-CoV spike (S) protein is a large type I transmembrane glycoprotein projected from viral envelope (Bosch et al., 2003). SARS-CoV S protein consists of two functional domains S1 (residues 1\u2013667) and S2 (residues 668\u20131255) (Wu et al., 2004). S1 contains the receptor-binding site and is responsible for binding to cellular receptors on the target cells (Li et al., 2003). S2 contains two heptad repeat regions (HR1 and HR2), which assemble into a six-helix bundle and result in membrane fusion (Liu et al., 2004, Tripet et al., 2004). Moreover, S protein contains important virus-neutralizing epitopes that elicit neutralizing antibody in the host species (Chen et al., 2005, Hofmann et al., 2004a, Sui et al., 2004). Several reports indicated that blocking the binding of the S protein to cellular receptors can prevent virus entry. For examples, antibody against S protein efficiently neutralizes SARS-CoV and inhibits syncytial formation between S protein and ACE2 (Keng et al., 2005, Sui et al., 2004). Furthermore, soluble S or ACE2 protein blocks S protein mediates infection (Hofmann et al., 2004b, Moore et al., 2004, Wong et al., 2004). These finding suggested that S protein might be an attractive target for drug development.",

We designed a series of peptides corresponding to SARS-CoV S protein to evaluate the inhibitory potential of small peptides on both the binding of S protein and the infectivity of S-protein-pseudotyped retrovirus to Vero E6 cells in this study. This approach of utilizing compounds that block receptor interaction has proven useful in other viral systems, including human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and hepatitis C virus (DeClercq, 2001, van Compernolle et al., 2003). Results of this study indicated that SP-10 (residues 668\u2013679) was a potent inhibitor and abolished binding of the S protein to ACE2 and Vero E6 cells.",

            "text": "Virus entry process is an attractive drug target for blocking infection. Virus envelope protein initially binds to cell surface receptor, leading to its global conformational changes. Subsequently, the fusion peptide is exposed to insert into the target cell membrane, resulting in fusion between the cell membrane and viral envelope, which allow the virus genome to enter the target cells (Liu et al., 2004). Based on this process, fusion-inhibitory peptides have been successfully developed, or under advance clinical trial for various viruses, such as T-20 for HIV-1, C-peptides (P-400 and Pcr-400) for human T-cell leukemia virus, and D4E1 for feline immunodeficiency virus (Kilby et al., 1998, Ma et al., 2002, Pinon et al., 2003). Recently, this strategy of utilizing peptides that block membrane fusion has been applied in SARS-CoV. For examples, HR2-peptide of S protein has been shown to interfere with S protein conformational changes, resulting in inhibition of SARS-CoV fusion with target cells (Liu et al., 2004, Ni et al., 2005, Zhu et al., 2004, Yuan et al., 2004). Peptides derived from HR1 region of S protein have also been identified as potential inhibitors for virus entry (Ni et al., 2005, Yuan et al., 2004). In this study, we designed small peptides derived from S protein to evaluate their inhibitions of S protein binding to ACE2 and Vero E6 cells. This approach of utilizing compounds that block receptor interaction has proven useful in other viral systems, including HIV-1 and hepatitis C virus, where compounds designed to inhibit viral entry through blockade of the viral receptors are finding success in vitro and in clinical trials (DeClercq, 2001, van Compernolle et al., 2003). Because RNA viruses are capable of being randomly and selectively altered due to high replication numbers and the infidelity of the viral RNA polymerase, it is possible that virus would adapt resistance to inhibitors. However, Chakraborti et al. (2005) showed that most of the natural or artificial mutations on S protein did not affect the binding of S protein to ACE2. These findings suggested that the viruses could easily mutate and escape antibodies that do not exhibit the same energy profile of binding to S as ACE2. Therefore, our finding suggested that SP-10 was a potent inhibitor for the inhibition of S protein binding to Vero E6 cells, the first step in viral infection.",

By analyzing a series of peptides derived from S protein, we identified that peptides spanning residues 192\u2013203, 483\u2013494, and 660\u2013683 of S protein efficiently blocked the binding of S protein to ACE2. A novel putative receptor-binding region of S protein was defined by a peptide-scanning method. Furthermore, SP-10 has been identified as a potent inhibitor for the inhibition of S protein binding to Vero E6 cells. Therefore, SP-10 can be used as a candidate in designing more potent anti-SARS-CoV peptides for drug development in the future.",
