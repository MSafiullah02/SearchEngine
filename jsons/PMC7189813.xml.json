Although recent years have witnessed great enthusiasm around the field, it is simply not true that \u2018synthetic biology\u2019 is a newly coined term. We must go to the beginning of the past century to find that the French biophysicist St\u00e9phane Leduc used this term in 1912 as the title of his book on what he thought was the synthesis of artificial life. Meanwhile, the German\u2010American biochemist Jacques Loeb in 1906 defined the synthesis of life as the goal of biology (Pereto & Catala, 2007). Moreover, synthetic biology can even be included in an older tradition of thinking that was introduced by Goethe when he pointed out on the intrinsic value of a better understanding of life from a holistic perspective rather than when approached by the more successful analytic one (Goethe, 1817\u20131824). Biology was dominated in the last century by the powerful analytic approach. The advent of genomics, with its avalanche of data, led us to consider again the possibility of a synthetic biology. The recent history of the discipline showed us that the notion of synthesis is not unique, and at least three different categories with different aims, methodologies and techniques can be distinguished: protocell creation, DNA\u2010based device construction, and genome\u2010driven cell engineering (see table 1 by O'Malley et al., 2008). The aims of the \u2018protocell creation\u2019 approach are to construct viable approximations to cells and to understand the fundamental biological principles in general and the origin of life in particular. The aim of the \u2018device construction\u2019 approach is to apply the engineering principles to biology and to construct standardized biological devices. The \u2018cell engineering\u2019 approach pursues the synthesis of minimal but complete genomes and their insertion in cells to redesign and control metabolic processes.",

The cedar aphid symbiont, B. aphidicola BCc, represents a very advanced stage in the reductive process. With only 422 kb and just 362 protein\u2010coding genes, its genome is about 200 kb smaller than the other three B. aphidicola sequenced strains (Perez\u2010Brocal et al., 2006). This dramatic genome reduction is due to the loss of most genes involved in the biosynthesis of nucleotides, cofactors, transporters, peptidoglycan, as well as all ATPase subunits. Nevertheless, it still retains complete machinery for informational processes, and a simplified metabolic network for energy production, an indication that its minimal gene set is still able to support cellular life. Remarkably, it is engaged on a symbiotic consortium with Candidatus Serratia symbiotica, a second symbiont massively present and with a long\u2010term association in the cedar aphid (2004, 2008), for the provision of some essential nutrients (Gosalbes et al., 2008). Complementarity in metabolic capabilities also occurs in the bacteroidetes \u2018C.

Thus, \u2018C. Sulcia muelleri\u2019 provides essential amino acids whereas \u2018C. Baumannia cicadellinicola\u2019 primarily contributes with vitamins and cofactors to the consortium (2007, 2006).",

Carsonella ruddii\u2019, with a genome size of 160 kb, has been proposed as the bacterial endosymbiont with the smallest known genome. This highly compact genome contains overlapping adjacent ORFs, and only 182 protein\u2010coding genes have been predicted (Nakabachi et al., 2006), a much lower number than previous proposals for minimal genomes, and almost half of the genes identified in B. aphidicola BCc. More than half of the \u2018C. Carsonella ruddii\u2019 genes are devoted to translation and amino acid metabolism, but just a few tRNA genes could be identified, and some essential amino acid biosynthetic steps and pathways are missing. Furthermore, there is a total absence of genes for most bacterium\u2010specific processes (Tamames et al., 2007). It remains to be elucidated if many of the lost genes have been transferred from the genome of a Carsonella ancestor to the genome of a psyllid ancestor, now being expressed under the control of the host nucleus (Nakabachi et al., 2006). This hypothesis would be in accordance with the endosymbiont theory for the origin of organelles. Maybe this strain of \u2018C. Carsonella ruddii\u2019 is on its way to become a new subcellular entity, closer to an organelle than to a minimal living cell (Tamames et al., 2007).",

These bacteria fix CO2 using electrons from H2S to drive an autotrophic metabolism based on a slightly modified version of the reductive pentose phosphate pathway (Calvin\u2013Benson cycle). They have the potential for all essential biomolecule anabolism, except threonine (and isoleucine) and ubiquinone, and recycle nitrogen. The few missing steps in those pathways could be explained by the function of a yet unidentified enzyme, or by complementation with the host metabolism. Thus, these deep\u2010sea clams with only a vestigial gut and greatly reduced filtering ability depend on their endosymbionts for most nutrients, including amino acids, vitamins, fatty acids, and nucleotides. On the bacterial side, their position on specialized bacteriocytes in the outermost layer of the gill epithelial cells allows the bacteria to use sulfide as electron donor and oxygen (or nitrate) as electron acceptor, from the clam blood and environmental water, respectively, thus avoiding the spontaneous reaction of both components (Lane, 2007). These two autotrophic bacteria, endosymbionts of eukaryotic cells, could represent an intermediate state of metabolic minimization between the extreme reduction shown by heterotrophic endosymbionts and the minimization undergone by free\u2010living marine bacteria.",

Although, as above stated, the genome reduction syndrome shares many features with that of host\u2010dependent prokaryotes, it appears to be a consequence of a selective process favouring bacterial adaptation to an environment with low concentrations of nutrients, allowing these organisms to make a substantial reduction of their cell machinery and still thrive in remarkable oligotrophic conditions, most likely as a consequence of the increase in their surface : volume ratio (Dufresne et al., 2005).",

The high light\u2010adapted ecotype MED4 has a genome of 1.66 Mb that codes for 1717 proteins (Rocap et al., 2003). The comparative analysis with other Prochlorococcus genomes revealed the constant changes that take place in response to the different environmental challenges (2003, 2004, 2003). Yet, all of their genomes code for a complete metabolic network based on carbon fixation by the Calvin\u2013Benson cycle, and a photoelectronic transport chain that allows the biosynthesis of all cellular constituents from CO2, mineral salts, and visible light. DNA repair systems, chaperones, nitrogen metabolism, transport systems, and the motility machinery are simplified or absent in comparison to freshwater cyanobacteria. The reduction of about 30% in genome size, compared with other close relatives such as Synechococcus, is compatible with the assumption that a massive gene loss has occurred during the evolution from a Prochlorococcus ancestor (Dufresne et al., 2005).",

This bacterium has the potential to biosynthesize all protein amino acids and most cofactors. Genome minimization is reflected by the nearly complete absence of nonfunctional or redundant DNA, with very short intergenic regions, and the lack of pseudogenes and phage genes. Its pattern of genome reduction is consistent with the hypothesis of genome streamlining driven by selection acting on a very large population occupying a very low nutrient and stable habitat. In this sense, P. ubique appears to employ an adaptive strategy that resembles the highly successful marine unicellular cyanobacteria in its simple metabolism and small genome size.",

The first attempt to define a minimal gene set for life was made by comparative genomics, soon after the first two bacterial genomes, from Haemophilus influenzae and M. genitalium (Mushegian & Koonin, 1996), were sequenced. The underlying hypothesis was that genes shared between distantly related species are likely to be essential. In addition, both bacteria are human parasites with reduced genomes. Mycoplasma genitalium genome, as stated above, still represents the smallest known genome of a bacterium that can be grown in the laboratory, and therefore must be close to a minimal autonomous genome. The comparative analysis led to the proposal of a minimal gene\u2010set composed only by 256 genes, mostly involved in genetic information storage and processing, protein chaperoning and a limited metabolic capability. Although many additional comparative analyses have been performed since then (reviewed in Carbone, 2006), there is an intrinsic limitation of this method that needs to be empathized: as it was already addressed since the very beginning of comparative genome analyses (Mushegian & Koonin, 1996), many essential cellular functions can be performed by several alternative and unrelated (nonorthologous) proteins, and will be mislead by comparative approaches. In fact, the comparative minimal core (common set of genes) only retrieves those genes involved in functions for which there is no alternative in nature (e.g. the complex translational machinery, including the ribosome).",

But, still, all these methods have limitations, because they uncover several possibilities of misclassification of genes. Transposon mutagenesis might overestimate the minimal set by considering as essential some genes that slow down the growth without arresting it, but can also miss essential genes that tolerate transposon insertions. The use of antisense RNA is limited to genes for which an adequate expression of the inhibitory RNA can be obtained. Inactivation of single genes does not detect essential functions encoded by redundant genes, and some individually dispensable genes may not be simultaneously dispensable (a phenomenon called synthetic lethality).",

For the first time, in this study the authors analyzed the functional completeness of the minimal metabolism coded by the proposed gene repertoire (involving 62 protein\u2010coding genes out of a minimal set of 208 genes). This aspect was further explored, demonstrating the stoichiometric consistency and some architectural properties of the derived minimal metabolic network (Gabaldon et al., 2007). However, it must be emphasized that metabolic complexity is ecologically dependent, i.e. it is a function of the chemical compounds and the primary energy source(s) available to the living system in a given environment (Morowitz, 1992).

Although some challenges still need to be faced before the goal can be accomplished (i.e. appropriate genes for tRNA modification, replication of monomer DNA circles over byproducts, ribosome assembly under physiological conditions, efficiency of translation, control and integration of subsystems, and cosegregation of genes with their products), the in vitro plan to synthesize it is on its way (Forster & Church, 2007), although on the basis of still unrealistic assumptions under the current technologies, like considering membranes as optional.",

There are different ways to force a cellular population to go through a genome\u2010reductive process (e.g. selection for faster replication, damaging some DNA repair systems, or forcing the cells to grow in nutrient\u2010poor conditions and pass through population bottlenecks), but all of them are slow and highly unpredictable. Furthermore, there are no adequate protocols to select for smaller genomes and, due to the randomness of the process, it is quite difficult to identify the genomic location of the losses. It is, therefore, more convenient to use targeted approaches toward genome reduction. The minimization process can be accelerated using different experimental strategies, which include plasmid or linear DNA\u2010mediated procedures, as well as the use of site\u2010specific recombinases and transposons. Processes of minimization in the laboratory have been pursued with E. coli (2004, 2005, 2002, 2007, 2006, 2002), B. subtilis (2007, 2008, 2003), Corynebacterium glutamicum (2005a, 2005b, 2005c, 2005d), and M. genitalium (Glass et al., 2006). Some of these targeted approaches, aiming at the careful deletion of selected presumably dispensable genome regions, produced reduced\u2010genome cells displaying virtually unaffected physiological features, and some emergent beneficial properties (2008, 2006, 2003). Surprisingly, many of the removed genes were considered essential in a massive transposon mutagenesis experimental study (Gerdes et al., 2003). However, when more extensive deletions were generated to maximize the extent of genome reduction, the indiscriminative removal of large DNA fragments resulted in aberrant cell morphology and reduced growth rate (Hashimoto et al., 2005). In fact, it can be considered that an artificially reduced genome accepts further reductions with growing pains, making difficult the task of determining if there is a minimal deletion core. Three issues are critical to understand why. First, redundancy might be only apparent. Second, each part of the genome is loosely connected with the rest, so that each part functions worse when contiguous parts are eliminated, and deleterious effects are normally incremental. Third, the mechanism of cell division is not yet completely understood. It seems that a bacterium uses the bulk of the chromosome to take some measurements as to where and when to initiate cell division (Yu & Margolin, 1999). When increasing portions of the genome are deleted, the measuring system starts to malfunction (G. P\u00f3sfai, pers. commun.).",

However, the common set of legs (minimal deletion core) is zero, because no particular leg is essential if we eliminate them one by one. Proper function requires proper disposition of the four legs, and if it has only three then the chair has to readapt to the three legs' new disposition. Similarly, a simplified genome might require rebalancing due to the loose network connections that involve the whole genome. And we can go further: if we think on equilibrists or bicycles, they can also work on two\u2010leg and even one\u2010leg chairs (using wheels in movement we can limit the number of legs to just one). Similarly, under specific carefully selected conditions, genomes can be greatly simplified. We are convinced that a minimal cell is feasible in the long run, following an iterative procedure with deletion/adjustment/deletion cycles. In this way, compensatory mutations may be necessary to rebalance the genome, allowing for the genome to spontaneously adjust to each substantial deletion before attempting a further reduction in size.",

Although these techniques allowed for the complete reconstruction of long functional sequences (from phages to complete genetic pathways) (2002, 2004), they present some relevant inconveniences: oligonucleotide synthesis was expensive, and mutations could arise during their synthesis as well as in the PCR steps, leading to a too high error rate for its use on a genomic scale. Several correction procedures were designed to reduce the error rate, based on the use of photo\u2010programmable microfluidic chips for oligonucleotide assembly (which also exploit the advantage of miniaturization to reduce material costs) (Tian et al., 2004), by adding natural DNA mismatch repair proteins to detect DNA mismatches and discriminate between correct and incorrect sequences (Carr et al., 2004) or using a recursive method to generate error\u2010free long DNA molecules form imperfect oligonucleotides (Linshiz et al., 2008). Now that limiting factors such as DNA length and synthesis fidelity are in their way to be solved, constructing large and complex circuits by commercial de novo DNA synthesis will soon become cheaper than the use of standard gene manipulation and cloning technologies. This is why these new technologies are rapidly being adopted by DNA synthesis companies, which are developing new technological platforms that combine advanced informatics, sophisticated automation, and a battery of biochemical protocols to allow the design and massive scale production of biological devices, from full\u2010length genes, operons, and pathways to, ultimately, genomes (Serrano, 2007).",

Its protocell, DNA\u2010based device construction, and genome\u2010driven cell engineering views have gained increased interest because, probably more than any other biological discipline, synthetic biology recreates nature, allowing the design and fabrication of an artificial minimal cell. But does this task require the complete understanding of cell functions? According to Haldane (1940), producing an artificial cell under laboratory conditions would occur even before we fully understand the processes going on inside cells. On the other hand, in direct confrontation with a very na\u00efve reductionist approach made by engineers, some others think that it is necessary to gain first a better understanding on how the cell systems functionally integrate (2007, 2008, 2007). At any rate, biological organisms are highly complex, and we currently lack enough knowledge about how living systems work. In fact, even if we consider only the genetic information represented by protein\u2010coding genes, about a third of genes from any given natural genome have an unknown function, making it difficult to predict any organism capabilities. If we want to understand the functions that are performed by a synthetic cell, we need to get as close as possible to a minimal genome in which any given essential role is performed by the products of a well\u2010characterized set of genes, which will make it easier to study and predictably engineer, if desired.",

These artificial cells would be ideal containers for inserting new genetic modules or modifying existing ones, molding new genomes to customize microorganisms for different purposes (Andrianantoandro et al., 2006). Even more, with the ability to generate a synthetic specific genome, a modified genetic code could be defined so that no alternative codons were used, thus leaving additional codons for the incorporation of non\u2010natural amino acids in cellular proteins. Provided that an organism with such a designed genome would function, the incorporation of a variety of non\u2010natural amino acids will allow the fabrication of novel proteins with novel functions (Drubin et al., 2007).

Complete genomes, genome segments, or functional modules can be synthesized on a BAC platform and tested for function. Conjugation is a very promiscuous mechanism and it works perfectly with minimal cells. For instance, Prochlorococcus has been found to be a good recipient that can accept and stably inherit plasmid RSF1010 from Proteobacteria (Tolonen et al., 2006). In addition, we have found that all genes essential on the recipient cell side for conjugation to take place are included on the minimal genome, as judged from results on plasmid conjugation using the 3906 mutants of the Keio collection (Baba et al., 2006) as recipients (D. P\u00e9rez\u2010Mendoza, M.V. Mendiola & F. de la Cruz, submitted).",

Engineered mycoplasma with further\u2010reduced genomes might be appropriate living vectors for the introduction of new genetic circuits designed to fight against human diseases; selected soil bacteria may be appropriate vessels where to implement and/or to modify genetic circuits for bioremediation, while particular cyanobacteria could be useful for H2 production or CO2 sequestration.",
