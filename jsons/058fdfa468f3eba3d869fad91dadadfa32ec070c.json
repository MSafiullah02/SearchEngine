We also noted how enhanced molecular capabilities in therapeutics and diagnostics provide new opportunities for detection and containment.",

The annual costs of HAIs in the US alone have been estimated at $23 billion, with 115 000 deaths per year. 8 In Australia, the ACSQHC has been instrumental in efforts to reduce HAIs, largely via hospital accreditation.",

These efforts promise significant benefits, as shown by a recent report of a significant reduction of Staphylococcus aureus bloodstream infections in Australian institutions. 9 Despite the advances in combating AMR, we remain vulnerable to outbreaks. In his Natural history, Pliny the Elder (23-79 AD) wrote, \"There is always something new out of Africa\". The same applied in 2014. Just over 12 months ago, no one could have foreseen the global ramifications of the Ebola virus epidemic. A few isolated cases quickly led to epidemic spread in impoverished urban centres of Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea that rapidly overwhelmed local health systems. This outbreak has highlighted not only our global vulnerability to epidemics, but also the immense value of traditional strict infection control practices, which when applied have resulted in a marked diminution in the projected size of the epidemic. New technologies have enabled development of novel rapid diagnostics and candidate vaccines which provide enormous hope for future epidemics. 10 Vaccines against dengue virus and Clostridium difficile are two other examples where there is promise for future advances. However, possession of effective vaccines is not sufficient for control. Infrastructure for delivery needs to be present, and consumers must have confidence in vaccine safety and efficacy. Controlled pathogens can re-emerge when this framework breaks down, as shown by the resurgence of poliomyelitis in war-torn Syria and outbreaks in Pakistan after the murder of vaccine volunteers, and the recent measles outbreak in the US linked to Disneyland in California. The latter shows that electronic media can be a powerful tool for consumer education but also a means to spread misinformation.",

Hepatitis C infection can now be cleared in a high proportion with antiviral agents, and prospects for a vaccine have never looked better. HIV has now become a long-term chronic viral illness for those infected who have access to newer, better tolerated antiretroviral agents. If longer-acting agents in clinical trials prove effective, further advances may be made, including control of HIV in marginalised groups and more effective prevention. Research into the role of human microbiota in the pathogenesis of both communicable and non-communicable diseases may provide further therapeutic advances. Faecal microbiota transplantation has now been proven to be an effective therapy for relapsing C. difficile infection and may have other future applications.",

Further advances are expected when they become more widely available in microbiology laboratories. However, technological advances may not always bring benefits. Robotisation of specimen handling is fuelling the creation of remote, 24-hour automated laboratories, with downsizing or closure of on-site hospital laboratories and loss of well trained laboratory scientists. This could see clinicians being given more complex data (eg, on a new obscure organism), without the ability to interpret their significance if there is a lack of available microbiological expertise. Compounding this is the decline in understanding of basic microbiology, infections and antibiotic use in newly graduated junior doctors in Australia. 11 The end results may be increased inappropriate testing, antibiotic overprescribing and errors in prescribing, which would be counterproductive to our national quality and stewardship aims. This knowledge gap needs to be addressed as a priority by Australian medical schools.",

ASID recognises that global strategies to reduce AMR, coupled with the extraordinary advances in molecular diagnostics, are essential for outbreak preparedness and to advance control of endemic pathogens.
