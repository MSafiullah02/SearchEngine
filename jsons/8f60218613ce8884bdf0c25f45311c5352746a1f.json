That businesses operate in the context of some larger system, not a vacuum, is today part of the accepted business perspective. However, we ought to recognize that scanning and the related processes of contingency planning presume our ability to discern future patterns. Many well-known business mistakes, such as the Big Three's disastrous handling of the energy crisis in the 1970s, can be attributed as much to inadequate managerial skills as ignorance about environmental trends. After all, it was not any existing predators that eradicated the dinosaurs, but instead it was something never before seen and hence could not have been anticipated. The fact that the meteor was not in the dinosaur's vernacular did not prevent a meteor from changing the course of earth's history. The scope of our environmental scanning activities expands as our knowledge increases. Such scanning is informed by new developments that have often been prospering just below the corporate radar screen.",

Even though contagious diseases are well-known, and their fatal impact acknowledged, e.g. pneumonic plague, Spanish-flu and bubonic plague, the world was caught completely off-guard by the SARS outbreak. Despite superhuman efforts by the many health-care workers around the world, it was months (and many deaths) before the World Health Organization pronounced the epidemic temporarily halted.",

            "text": "The health-care establishment could not have predicted the outbreak. As devastating as it was for many businesses, strategic planners would have to be psychic to have anticipated the disease and to incorporate it in the planning process. However, it would be useful to delineate lessons that can be learned from the recent SARS (and other) outbreaks, and discuss how strategic management may benefit from an appreciation of these lessons. In preparation for unforeseen external events organizations should have a plan in place to reduce the influence on the organization and provide an operation manual in the event of a crisis. However, many Fortune 1,000 firms do not have a crisis-management plan at all (Hickman and Crandall, 1997) . As seen with the SARS outbreak this lack of preparedness can have devastating effects on business and warrant inclusion in our business definition of a crisis. A crisis is defined as a low probability/high consequence event, caused by human actions, that threatens the most fundamental goals of an organization (Weick, 1988) . Mitroff and Pearson (1993) categorized crises according to two dimensions: normal to sever and technical/economic to human/social. However, their crisis analysis included only industrial health problems, not epidemics. There is a need to broaden the scope of crisis to include epidemics. Our paper aims to provide this addition. This paper will start by presenting background information on the SARS epidemic and the impact on organizations, especially those operating in emerging markets. Next, characteristics of countries termed emerging markets will be identified and the inherent risks and challenges organizations face operating in these markets will be discussed. Third, we offer recommendations for minimizing the impact of operating in an emerging market where contagious diseases are a reality. This represents an important first step towards developing (and implementing) a robust contingency plan for purposes of business continuity.",

            "text": "On the basis of purchasing power parity, emerging and developing economies account for 44 percent of the world's economy (Gingrich, 1999) . Conservative predictions conclude that by the year 2020 the developing world will account for over 60 percent of the total world output (Belous et al., 1996) . Given the substantial growth in these economies, it is not surprising that the US Department of Commerce's International Trade Administration recently predicted that the greatest commercial opportunities will be found in the Big Emerging Markets such as The People's Republic of China (China), India, Singapore, Mexico, Vietnam, or South Africa (Qureshi, 1996) . China provides perhaps the clearest illustration. For example, in 2002 China received $52 billion in direct foreign investment, overtaking the United States to make it the world's biggest recipient of direct foreign investment (Buckman, 2003) . According to the US Bureau of Economic Analysis in 2002, China and Hong Kong accounted for nearly a quarter of the income of US overseas subsidiaries (Karmin, 2003) . However, the recent SARS outbreak has shown how quickly commerce can be impacted in the global market. According to Richard Miller, an economist and vice president of the World Travel & Tourism Council: \"Never before has there been a massive impact of this nature other than a war shutting down an economy totally\" (Prystay, 2003) . As of June 20, 2003, outbreaks of SARS have occurred in 32 countries, resulting in 8,461 individuals being infected and 804 subsequent deaths (World Health Organization, 2003) .",

Some areas have been hit more harshly than others. In the Chinese province of Guangdong, the place where SARS is believed to have started, the country's largest export-trade fair saw orders drop in April nearly 50 percent (Leggett, 2003) . In Beijing, draconian measures were imposed to try to stem the spread of SARS. Public schools and universities were closed, migrant workers were told to stay in the capital and make-shift roadblocks were set up in villages to prevent city dwellers from entering (Kaufman and Chen, 2003) . In May, Hong Kong retail sales were down 80 to 90 percent, restaurants and their suppliers were going broke and hotel occupancy rates were in the single digits. Airlines were also severely impacted. Cathay Pacific Airway during this time dealt with an 87 percent decrease in air traffic from a year earlier (Meredith, 2003) . Such a decrease in travel is not surprising given the overall drop in business air travel globally. In a survey conducted by the Society for Human Resource Management in the USA, based on 423 human resource professionals, 20 percent reported cuts in employee travel as a result of SARS (USA Today, 2003) . Kingsway International Holdings Limited, a Hong Kong investment holding company that engages in securities brokerage, corporate finance advisory services, fund and asset management, securities investments, and strategic investment in technology-related businesses has seen earning per share drop from $0.44 in June 2002 to $0.002 in June 2003. The company attributes the results to the difficult operating conditions including the influence of SARS (Infomart, 2003) . March sales of desktop computers in Hong Kong plunged 37 percent, laptop sales dropped 22 percent and mobile-phone sales fell 16 percent (Leggett, 2003) . Cell phone sales dropped 40 percent in Guangzhou, the Shanghai auto show only drew one quarter of its expected visitors and Motorola shut its 18-story Asia Pacific headquarters building in Beijing (Engardio et al., 2003) .",

Westpac Bank has predicted that SARS could reduce Australia's economic growth by 0.3 percent (Chong, 2003) . Multinational corporations are also being impacted. For example 3M, the makers of the N95 face mask, one of the few face masks that are 95 percent effective at filtering out airborne diseases like SARS, does 21 percent of its $16 billion in annual sales in the Asia Pacific region. J.P. Morgan lists 3M as well as Intel and United Technologies as American companies that could be hurt by SARS (Freedman, 2003) . Other companies suggesting revenues will be down as a result of SARS include American International Group Inc., Yum Brand Inc., Goodrich Corp. (Karmin, 2003) and Cara Operations Ltd. (Flavelle, 2003) . Another industry feeling the impact of SARS is the phone makers. Motorola, a company holding 14 percent of the Chinese mobile phone market, has warned that it may fall short of sales and profit forecasts for the second quarter and year end citing weakening demand in Asia because of SARS (Timmons, 2003) . Four Season's Hotel Inc. has a net loss in the first quarter of 27 cents per share compared to net income of 22 cents per share a year earlier (Infomart, 2003) . SARS is seen as a key contributor to this loss. The city of Toronto also provides an indication of the economic impact of SARS claiming the cost to the government for health care and income compensation for those quarantined for the first six months of 2003 totaled US$860 million (Chowdhury, 2003) .",

It is believed that China, in order to maintain a semblance of stability and economic prosperity at the time of changing government leaders, covered up the MD 42,6 truth about the extent of SARS. It went so far as to remove SARS patients from hospitals to deceive inspectors from the World Health Organization (Jue, 2003) . In April, Jiang Yanyong blew the whistle on Chinese authorities' deceit regarding the truth about SARS in Beijing. In a letter to journalists, when Beijing was saying that only 12 people in the city were infected with SARS, Dr Jiang disclosed that the true number of SARS patients was at least 100, including ten who had died. In response to Dr Jiang's revelation the health minister and Beijing mayor were fired. For a regime with a long history of deception and denial, this event has been viewed as a revolution in official openness (York, 2003) . In a step to reinforce openness the Chinese government has threatened to execute anyone who knowingly spreads the SARS virus (Dean, 2003) . However, this may have the reverse impact of making people hesitant to admit they have SARS for fear of punishment. By lying about the true number of SARS patients, Beijing damaged what little faith international economist has in its numbers. For example, repeated yearly claims of 8 percent annual GDP may be questionable. For the new Chinese leadership the incentive to cheat is even greater than usual. Strong GDP growth has been the key to the Communist party's hold on power. The new government would not want to be associated with instant economic failure (August, 2003) .",

The Associated Press (2003) reported an outbreak of encephalitis in southern China that has (at time of writing) affected several hundred people and resulted in more than a dozen deaths. At the same time as this new disease is spreading in China and Hong Kong, the government in Hong Kong is pushing ahead with tough new security laws which journalists fear could inhibit future reporting of crisis. Under the new legislation reporters could well be jailed for publishing details of state secrets and confidential communication between Hong Kong and Beijing. Thomas Crampton, president of the Foreign Correspondents Club of Hong Kong stated that in a country where health statistics are a state secret the legislation \"puts a pall of uncertainty over reporting in Hong Kong. It encourages self-censorship\" (Korporaal, 2003) . For businesses operating in this and related regions, another outbreak and the possibility of another Chinese cover up could not be good news. While it is hard to beat the wage rates of 50 to 80 cents an hour in China, it is a constant corporate challenge to operate in an environment where propaganda and obfuscation are used as government marketing tools.",

It is not clear if SARS can be eradicated. The disease could gain a toehold in the Southern Hemisphere, or it could lie low until cold weather returns (Regalado, 2003) . While SARS is taking the center stage, areas in Europe are dealing with another disturbing virus that is spreading among chickens and in some cases humans. The Avian flu has been found in the Netherlands, Belgium and Germany. The virus, which rarely causes serious illness in humans, infected 80 people who came in contact with infected birds (Fuhrmans, 2003) . It is also conceivable that corporations may be operating in regions of the world where they will face bio-terrorism. As an indication of the possibility of such sabotage the US Department of Justice and the Federal Emergency Management Agency staged a mock terrorist attack on Chicago airports in May 2003. This is the second such exercise, the first being staged at a Denver concert hall in May 2000. In this year's exercise, terrorists sprayed unseen germs over Chicago airports, infecting thousands with a lethal pneumonia. The exercise was undertaken to determined level of preparedness in the event of bio-terrorism (Chase, 2003) .",

Benefits of a fast response can be seen in the fast reaction of the Canadian health authorities dealing with SARS preventing the outbreak from reaching unmanageable numbers. According to Castillo-Chavez, a mathematical epidemiologist at Cornell University, if the Canadian outbreak had been left to run unchecked it could easily have infected as many as 200,000 in the Toronto area (Brown, 2003) .

That, in the memorable phrase of Wen Kilama, a Tanzanian researcher, is roughly the scale of the carnage wrought by one disease, malaria, mainly in Africa\" (The Economist, 2003) . More recently, the spread of SARS captured center stage, due as much to the disease's proclivity as to media's desire for the next major headline. Augmented or not, that SARS has been (and may continues to be) destructive is unequivocal. Indeed, because MD 42,6 most of the inflicted jurisdictions are important developing economies, SARS poses serious implications for businesses around the world. As Surowiecki (2003) noted in the New Yorker magazine, \"Before SARS, China was going to be the factory floor to the world. Now it has to worry about becoming the sick ward of the East\".",

Lest we thought the plague is a thing of the past, outbreaks of bubonic and pneumonic plagues in 1994 killed more than 200 in India (King, 2001) .

While the disease may be well publicized, its connection with the business community is not often elaborated upon. In fact, otherwise innocuous actions on the part of businesses have a hand in spreading the disease. For instance, truckers working for long-distance transportation companies have been identified as a major transmitter of the disease throughout Africa and Asia. HIV/AIDS also has devastating effects on businesses themselves. Barclay's Bank of Zambia, for example, reported losing more than a quarter of its senior managers to the disease. A mattress company in Zimbabwe hires and trains three people for every position due to attrition by the disease (Forstater et al., 2002) . AIDS has become South Africa's biggest single killer. In a 2001 South Africa's Medical Research Council calculated that 40 percent of the deaths of those aged between 15 and 49 in the previous year were due to the AIDS pandemic. In recognition of the impact HIV/AIDS is having on its work force, DaimlerChrysler South Africa has, since 1999, provided funding for standardized treatment for HIV-related diseases and anti-retroviral medication for its employees (DaimlerChrysler, 2003) . According to the African vice president of the World Bank, Callisto Madavo, HIV is the single greatest threat to future economic development in Africa. Of equal concern though is the growth rate of AIDS in Asia. AIDS is growing fastest in Asia leading many health experts to believe that it may overtake Africa in the number of people infected with HIV. This will create a vexing problem for investors in Europe and North America as their economies peak and they increasingly turn to the Third World for profits. Inexpensive labor is appealing but what if you cannot find employees to complete an order (Jeter, 1999) ?",

Crisis management plans must be robust enough to handle all forms of the unexpected. As events arise that give us insight into the unforeseen, it is essential that organizations reexamine their crisis management plans to see if they were designed effectively enough to handle the unique features of our evolving environment.
