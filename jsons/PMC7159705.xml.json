A total of 788 premature and term infants were studied for respiratory viruses in their nasopharynx: three of these seven studies included all infants with signs of respiratory tract infection, two studies included all infants with suspected nosocomial sepsis and two studies included all infants in the NICU. In 16% (range 10\u201352%) of the cases, a respiratory virus was detected and this was mostly diagnosed in symptomatic infants.

In the most severe cases, mechanical ventilation and even extracorporeal membrane oxygenation are needed because of respiratory compromise. In neonates, a respiratory virus infection can also present as a systemic illness that resembles bacterial sepsis 11, 13. The most common systemic signs include apnoea, tachypnoea, temperature instability, lethargy and poor feeding. In addition to these nonspecific symptoms, the first signs in hospitalised infants can be an increased need of ventilator support or hypoxaemia. Extrapulmonary manifestations of respiratory virus infections may also occur. The most common of these are meningoencephalitis, perimyocarditis, hepatitis, coagulopathy, myositis, skin symptoms and gastroenteritis 14. These manifestations are due to the viraemic spread of certain respiratory viruses, such as enteroviruses, the adenovirus, bocavirus\u20101 and parechovirus. The common respiratory viruses and their clinical pictures in neonates are presented in more detail in Table 2\n15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24.",

Well\u2010known risk factors for severe illness include prematurity, young age or decreased body size when they are infected and pre\u2010existing medical conditions affecting lung function 14. Other factors affecting the severity of neonatal respiratory virus infections include the type of virus, the virus serotype/genotype, mode of transmission and the presence of passively acquired, specific maternal antibodies. Significant correlations between the genes in the immune system and the risk of severe respiratory virus infection have been observed. For example, in preterm infants single\u2010nucleotide polymorphisms in several genes have been shown to be associated with the risk of developing severe RSV infections independent of premorbid lung function 25. Furthermore, decreased innate immune cytokine responses have been shown to correlate with disease severity not only in RSV but also in rhinovirus bronchiolitis 26. Multiple respiratory virus detection occurs in 20\u201340% of children with respiratory virus infections, but this finding seems to be less common in young infants. In many studies, the bocavirus\u20101 plus a rhinovirus has been the most common combination of multiple viruses. Whether coinfections contribute to disease severity is currently unclear 27. Likewise, the clinical significance of viral load on the disease severity has not yet been established.",

It may, however, guide the decision about whether the infant should be hospitalised or treated as an outpatient.

With the rapid development of high\u2010throughput molecular techniques, several new viruses associated with respiratory diseases, such as the bocavirus\u20101, metapneumovirus and coronavirus have been identified, and our knowledge of respiratory virus infections has substantially increased. PCR tests are also significantly more sensitive than the other methods, which has increased the rates of viral detection. Over the past decade, PCR tests have been multiplexed and it is now possible to screen up to 16\u201320 respiratory viruses concurrently from a single mucus sample with a flocked nasal swab 28. However, it must be kept in mind that the sensitivity of multiplex PCR tests is not as high as that of PCR tests for detecting a single virus. It should also be emphasised that in contrast to a positive virus culture, a positive PCR test does not necessarily reflect active virus replication. A rhinovirus PCR test is positive during and after symptomatic infection, in subclinical infection, or just in an innocent contamination 15. Transcriptional profiling is a useful tool for discriminating between an active infection and incidental virus detection 29. With respect to the impact of the viral load, the available studies have provided conflicting results about the correlation between viral load and either infectiousness or the presence of infectious viral particles 15.",

Most respiratory viruses are acquired postnatally through close contact with infected caregivers. Nevertheless, current evidence supports the concept that the transmission of some viruses to neonates may also occur during the antenatal period through maternal viraemia and transplacental spread to the foetus, or perinatally by exposure to maternal infected secretions 30. The onset of symptoms following infection with respiratory viruses varies from 24 hours to several days. As described earlier, the initial signs and symptoms of respiratory virus diseases in neonates can be identical to those seen in bacterial infections. Furthermore, routine laboratory markers are inconclusive in differentiating bacterial from viral infections, especially during the early phase of the disease. In a recent study in children aged from one to 24 months, interferon inducible myxovirus resistance protein A had a 92% sensitivity for symptomatic respiratory virus infections 31. Because the outcome of a neonatal bacterial infection is markedly improved if the illness is recognised early and appropriate antimicrobial agents are administered promptly, it is plausible that viral diseases in neonates are often treated with broad\u2010spectrum antibiotics 11. Thus, we recommend that any infant with suspected late\u2010onset or nosocomial sepsis or signs of a serious infection, should also be evaluated for the most common respiratory viruses with multiplex PCR test from nasopharyngeal specimens, in addition to a complete sepsis workup 10, 13. Practitioners could also be advised to order a multiplex PCR test for respiratory viruses in infants if they demonstrate an early\u2010onset sepsis\u2010like clinical presentation and bacterial samples remain negative. Because preterm infants, in particular, may not have classic cold symptoms during respiratory tract infections, routine detection of respiratory viruses should also be proposed if neonates treated in NICUs present with respiratory symptoms or clinical deterioration.",

Restricting visitors to neonatal units during virus outbreaks in the community could also be a reasonable precaution. Symptomatic parents may transmit viruses to their infant. The risk of virus infection should be weighed against the disadvantages of parent\u2010infant separation if excluding the symptomatic parents from the hospital is the customary practice. Virus\u2010positive infants should be strictly isolated and cared for by nurses who are not responsible for caring for infants without the virus.

Although it is conceivable that respiratory viral infections might lead to the development of asthma, by damaging the developing airways or altering the immune response 55, it has also been suggested that viral infections may simply reveal a pre\u2010existing tendency for asthma by inducing mucous metaplasia and airway hyperresponsiveness 56. Nevertheless, it is probable that there are multiple known and also unknown risk factors that contribute to the overall inception of asthma, acting independently or in conjunction.",

Enteroviruses are among the suspected environmental triggers in the induction of type 1 diabetes, a disease in which T cell\u2010mediated autoimmune processes target insulin\u2010producing beta cells in the pancreas. Enteroviruses, and in particular the group B coxsackievirus, appear to have the ability to damage beta cells 57, although the conclusive causative relationship between an enterovirus infection and the development of type 1 diabetes remains to be established 58. Early\u2010life enterovirus infections may also be associated with persistent hepatic and cardiac dysfunction and neurodevelopmental deficits among survivors 19. Parechovirus infections during the neonatal period have been shown to be associated with central nervous system white matter changes and delayed neurological development 59, 60. Therefore, longitudinal follow\u2010up and routine cognitive evaluation are necessary to document the long\u2010term consequences of the human parechovirus infection in infancy.",

Given the significant burden of respiratory virus infections among this highly susceptible population, and the limited prevention tools that are available, a focus on appreciating and containing the consequences of these infections is warranted. It can be recommended that any infant with signs of infection should also be suspected of having a respiratory virus infection. Simple flocked nasal swabs and multiplex PCR tests are recommended as diagnostic methods. Furthermore, all available preventive and curative modalities against viral respiratory tract infections during the neonatal period should be implemented. Preventing nosocomial virus infections by using intensified hygiene measures and cohorting infected infants should be a major goal in NICUs. Further research, active virus surveillance and long\u2010term follow\u2010up are also needed to ascertain the causality and the exact underlying mechanisms for adverse long\u2010term consequences.",
