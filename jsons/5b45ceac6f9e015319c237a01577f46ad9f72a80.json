Oral pleconaril treatment was studied in 2 parallel randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials. Among 1363 picornavirus-infected participants (65%) in the studies combined, the median time to alleviation of illness was 1 day shorter for pleconaril recipients than for placebo recipients ( ). Cold symptom P ! .001 scores and frequency of picornavirus cultured from nasal mucus specimens were lower among pleconaril recipients by day 2 of treatment. No treatment effects were seen in those without picornavirus infection. Pleconaril was associated with a higher incidence of nausea (6% vs. 4%) and diarrhea (9% vs. 7%) and with small increases in mean serum cholesterol levels and platelet counts, compared with baseline measurements. A subsequent 6-week prophylaxis study found that pleconaril induces cytochrome P-450 3A enzymes, which metabolize a variety of drugs, including ethinyl estradiol. Early pleconaril treatment was well tolerated and significantly reduced the duration and severity of colds due to picornaviruses in adults.",

The reverse primer sequence was 5 -GCT(G/C)CAGGGTTAAGGTTAGCC-3 , corresponding to the reverse complement of nucleotides 461-481 of HRV89. The double-labeled fluorescent probe sequence was 5 -(FAM)-TGAGTCCTCCGGCCCCTGAATG-(TAMRA)-3 , corresponding to nucleotides 438-459 of HRV89. In this assay, the lower limit of detection for the virus (HRV1B) used to generate the standard curve was 10 pfu/mL, or 10,550 genome equivalents/mL (211 genome equivalents per reaction).",

These results confirm and extend those of an earlier retrospective analysis of adults with colds due to picornaviruses, which found a 1.5-day reduction in the time to alleviation of illness in pleconaril recipients, compared with placebo recipients [10] . Pleconaril use was associated with significant reductions in symptom severity scores and the frequency of recovery of picornaviruses within 1 day after initiation of therapy. In addition, pleconaril therapy resulted in a significant reduction in the duration of each individual cold symptom monitored in the study, a finding consistent with the hypothesis that ongoing viral replication is an important contributor to the pathogenesis of cold symptoms.",

We also observed that substantial proportions of both placebo recipients and, less often, pleconaril recipients continued to have positive culture results on study day 6 or later, although at very low levels of viral RNA. This prolonged recovery of virus is consistent with earlier data from natural and experimentally induced rhinovirus infections [21, 22] , but it raises the issue of emergence of drug-resistant variants. In the current studies, viruses with reduced susceptibility to pleconaril (\u044310-fold change from baseline value) were recovered during or after therapy from \u223c10% of patients who received pleconaril. However, subgroup analyses indicate that clinical benefit for these participants was as good as or better than that for pleconaril recipients with no reduction in virus susceptibility to the drug (unpublished data). Further phenotypic and genetic characterization of viruses from these and other pleconaril trials is ongoing, to determine relationships between in vitro susceptibility and clinical outcomes.",

The small increases from baseline in cholesterol levels and platelet counts are not clinically significant, an observation that was confirmed in a subsequent 6-week prophylaxis study (unpublished observations). In that study, an excess of mild or moderate menstrual disorders (most commonly breakthrough bleeding or spotting) was reported from women taking oral contraceptives and pleconaril. Subsequent investigations revealed that pleconaril induces hepatic cytochrome P-450 3A enzymes. Pleconaril reduced the area under the curve of plasma levels of ethinyl estradiol by 34% following single-dose administration (G. Rhodes, personal communication). Retrospective review of all randomized, placebo-controlled trials in which pleconaril was administered for 5-7 days revealed that menstrual irregularities were reported by 3.5% of 310 pleconaril-treated women who were using oral contraceptives and by none of 291 placebo-treated women. None of the menstrual irregularities led to discontinuation of treatment. Additional studies are ongoing to better characterize the magnitude and duration of cytochrome P-450 3A induction and to determine the clinical significance for coadministration of pleconaril with other drugs metabolized by cytochrome P-450 3A.",
