Serum procalcitonin was measured for the moderate-severe case only (first case), which was negative. The laboratory investigations were checked for normal and abnormal values. The study revealed: two patients with high levels of lymphocyte count (13.3%), two patients with high levels of blood urea (13.3%), and three patients with high levels of CRP (20.0%). One of the mild cases revealed high CRP because of having concomitant gingival infection. The serum ferritin and ESR were high for patient no.1.
