As an example, while caspase 3 (CASP3) is globally recognized as a key effector in apoptosis (Galluzzi et al., 2018a; Singh et al., 2019) , its non-apoptotic role in the differentiation of multiple cell types (Nakajima and Kuranaga, 2017) is largely underappreciated.

Two other forms of autophagy have been described: (1) microautophagy, which involves the delivery of autophagy substrates to lysosomes upon invagination of the lysosomal membrane, and (2) chaperone-medicated autophagy (CMA), which relies on a specific splicing isoform of lysosomal-associated membrane protein 2 (LAMP2) as a translocase for KFERQ-containing cytosolic proteins into the lysosomal lumen (Kaushik and Cuervo, 2018; Li et al., 2012a) . The molecular apparatus that underlies these multiple variants of autophagy has been characterized with increasing precision (Dikic and Elazar, 2018) (Box 1). The crosstalk between bona fide autophagic responses and multiple other cellular processes has also been intensively investigated. Thus, it has become clear that autophagy occupies a central position in the biology of most eukaryotes, interfacing with the regulation of core metabolism (He et al., 2012; Sousa et al., 2016) , damage control (Fern\u00e1 ndez et al., 2018; Khaminets et al., 2015; Mathew et al., 2007) , and cell death Wang et al., 2012; Wei et al., 2013) .

In particular, this may have led investigators to misattribute phenotypic or functional effects caused by the pharmacological or genetic perturbation of single autophagy-regulatory factors to autophagy as a process (Galluzzi et al., 2017b) . Accumulating evidence suggests indeed that most, if not all, components of the molecular apparatus for autophagy mediate one or multiple effects that do not depend on lysosomal degradation of autophagy substrates (Table 1). In particular, autophagy-relevant proteins mediate non-autophagic effects that impinge on cellular functions linked to membrane biology, such as (1) endocytosis, phagocytosis, and intracellular vesicular trafficking; (2) conventional and non-conventional secretion; and (3) cytokinesis, as well as on (at least apparently) membrane-unrelated functions, such as (1) inflammatory and immune responses, (2) cell death, (3) genomic stability, and (4) cell proliferation (Table 2) . Moreover, several pathogens acquired the ability to hijack non-autophagic functions of the autophagy machinery for their own benefit, suggesting that such functions may have appeared early in the course of host-pathogen co-evolution (Choi et al., 2018; Evans et al., 2018a) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 152, "end": 173, "text": "(Evans et al., 2018b)", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 391, "end": 410, "text": "(Figures 1C and 1D)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 628, "end": 652, "text": "(Galluzzi et al., 2017b)", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 1590, "end": 1609, "text": "(Choi et al., 2018;", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1610, "end": 1630, "text": "Evans et al., 2018a)", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1345, "end": 1354, "text": "(Table 2)", "ref_id": "TABREF6"}], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Here, we discuss emerging data on non-autophagic functions of components of the molecular apparatus for autophagy.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Autophagy relies on the formation, maturation, and subcellular relocalization of autophagosomes, ultimately resulting in their fusion with lysosomes (Galluzzi et al., 2017a) .

UV radiation resistance-associated (UVRAG), a pro-autophagic BECN1 activator, also favors endocytosis through interactions with the class C vacuolar protein-sorting tethering complex and consequent increase in RAB7A activity (Liang et al., 2008; Pirooz et al., 2014) . Initially, such an effect, which involves accelerated endosomal maturation, was believed to be unrelated to BECN1 and the VPS34 complex (Liang et al., 2008) . However, at least in some cell types, VPS34 and VPS34 interactors involved in the control of growing membranes, including BECN1, VPS15, and SH3 domain containing GRB2 like, endophilin B1 (SH3GLB1, best known as BIF-1), have been implicated in this process, with no apparent roles for other VPS34 regulators such as ATG14 and RUN and cysteine-rich domain containing beclin 1 interacting protein (RUBCN) (McKnight et al., 2014; Thoresen et al., 2010) . Thus, while mice with a cerebellum-specific knockout of Atg7 exhibit a neurodegenerative disorder that develops over multiple months, the deletion of Becn1 from the same cellular compartment imposes rapid neurodegeneration (McKnight et al., 2014) . Most likely, this difference reflects the endocytic defect imposed by the loss of BECN1, leading to alterations in growth factor receptor signaling (McKnight et al., 2014) . Reinforcing this notion, downregulation of BECN1 (which is a common event in human tumors) (Tang et al., 2015; Yue et al., 2003) has been associated with increased AKT serine/threonine kinase 1 (AKT1) signaling in breast cancer cells (Rohatgi et al., 2015) . Such an observation could be ascribed to defective endosomal maturation in BECN1-incompetent cells, resulting in increased residency of growth factor receptors at phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (1) and successfully fuse with lysosomes (2) at baseline rates, underling the ability of autophagy to support normal cellular functions. (B) In the presence of an autophagic stimulus such as nutrient deprivation, the rate of autophagosome formation (3), autophagosome-lysosome fusion, and lysosomal degradation increases (4), resulting in accelerated degradation of autophagic substrates. (C) Autophagosomes also accumulate in the absence of an upstream autophagic stimulus (5) when lysosomal functions are inhibited (6), such as in the presence of lysosomotropic agents. (D) Finally, the autophagosome compartment expands, driven by an upstream stimulus (7), when autophagosomal content is destined to secretion, either upon (8) or independent of (9) fusion with lysosomes in the absence of lysosomal degradation. Thus, widely employed assays only based on the maturation of LC3 not only are unable to determine whether an expansion of the autophagosomal compartment compared to baseline (A) reflects upstream autophagy activation coupled to efficient lysosomal degradation (B) or downstream inhibition of autophagosome-lysosome fusion or lysosomal acidification (C), but also they cannot identify situations in which activation of upstream autophagy-relevant signaling modules mediate non-autophagic effects (D).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 504, "end": 524, "text": "(Liang et al., 2008;", "ref_id": "BIBREF66"}, {"start": 525, "end": 545, "text": "Pirooz et al., 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF94"}, {"start": 684, "end": 704, "text": "(Liang et al., 2008)", "ref_id": "BIBREF66"}, {"start": 1109, "end": 1132, "text": "(McKnight et al., 2014;", "ref_id": "BIBREF77"}, {"start": 1133, "end": 1155, "text": "Thoresen et al., 2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF128"}, {"start": 1381, "end": 1404, "text": "(McKnight et al., 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF77"}, {"start": 1555, "end": 1578, "text": "(McKnight et al., 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF77"}, {"start": 1672, "end": 1691, "text": "(Tang et al., 2015;", "ref_id": "BIBREF127"}, {"start": 1692, "end": 1709, "text": "Yue et al., 2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF146"}, {"start": 1815, "end": 1837, "text": "(Rohatgi et al., 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF105"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Endocytosis and Phagocytosis"}, {"text": "(PI3P)-negative signaling-competent endosomal compartments (Rohatgi et al., 2015) .

Both downregulation of UVRAG and PI3P depletion cause defects in Golgi-to-ER retrograde transport that are not linked to the autophagic functions of UVRAG (He et al., 2013) . However, autophagy induction by starvation and rapamycin results in the redistribution of UVRAG from RING1-containing complexes to BECN1-, VPS34-and BIF-1-containing complexes and consequent ATG9 recruitment at sites of autophagosome production (He et al., 2013) .

During initiation, the bioenergetic stress imposed by decreased nutrient availability manifests with increasing AMP levels, resulting in the activation of AMPK and consequent (1) inactivating phosphorylation of mechanistic target of rapamycin (MTOR) complex 1 (MTORC1) and (2) direct activating phosphorylation or indirect activating dephosphorylation (as a consequence of MTORC1 inhibition) of multiple proteins involved in initiation (e.g., ATG13, ULK1) and nucleation (e.g., ATG14, AMBRA1, UVRAG, BECN1). In this setting, ULK1 operates as part of a multiprotein complex containing ATG13, ATG101, and FIP200. ULK1-, AMPK-, and MTORC1-related phosphorylation/dephosphorylation events trigger phagophore nucleation (mostly at the ER) upon PI3P production by a supramolecular complex with class III PI3K activity consisting of VPS34 (the catalytic subunit), VPS15, BECN1, AMBRA1, and/or UVRAG, coupled to recruitment of ATG9-containing vesicles. The activity of this complex is under tonic inhibition by BCL2, reflecting the ability of BCL2 to engage in physical inhibitory interactions with BECN1. Phagophore elongation involves two ubiquitin-like conjugation systems. On one hand, ATG7 and ATG10 operate sequentially to catalyze the formation of ATG12-ATG5:ATG16L1 complexes. On the other hand, ATG4, ATG7, and ATG3 cooperate to cleave the precursors of LC3-like proteins into their mature forms, followed by conjugation to phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and recruitment to autophagosomes forming with the support of WIPI proteins. LC3 and LC3 homologues enable autophagosomes with the ability to bind autophagic substrates and/or proteins that mediate cargo selectivity (including p62). Indeed, while autophagic responses to nutrient deprivation are relatively non-selective, multiple other variants of autophagy exhibit exquisite substrate specificity. On closure, autophagosomes fuse with lysosomes to generate autolysosomes, generally followed by luminal acidification and consequent activation of lysosomal hydrolases that mediate substrate degradation. This latter step, which appears to involve (at least to some extent) the conjugation systems responsible for elongation (Tsuboyama et al., 2016) , is critical to discriminate bona fide autophagic responses from autophagy-independent functions of the autophagic machinery (Galluzzi et al., 2017a) .

In this context, loss of UVRAG destabilizes a supramolecular entity involved in endosome-tomelanosome fusion commonly known as BLOC-1 complex, an effect that is not sensitive to lysosomal inhibition . At least in some cells, a BECN1-and UVRAG-containing, ATG14-independent PI3K complex has also been suggested to participate in the control of cytokinesis, the final stage of mitosis whereby daughter cells separate once their nuclei have divided (Thoresen et al., 2010; You et al., 2016) . These latter observations reinforce the notion that multiple modules of the autophagy apparatus regulate the rearrangement of cellular membranes. A specific form of phagocytosis engaged by several pathogens and dead cell corpses, which is known as LC3-associated phagocytosis (LAP), depends on several proteins involved in bona fide autophagic responses (Martinez et al., 2015 (Martinez et al., , 2016 Sanjuan et al., 2007) . These include not only UVRAG, BECN1, and VPS34, which promote autophagy as a part of a single supramolecular entity, but also ATG3, ATG4, ATG5, ATG7, ATG12, ATG16L1, and multiple members of the microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (MAP1LC3, best known as LC3) family, which are all involved in the two major conjugation systems required for canonical autophagy (Box 1) (Martinez et al., 2015 (Martinez et al., , 2016 Sanjuan et al., 2007) . Importantly, LAP differs from bona fide autophagy in that (1) it targets to lysosomal degradation extracellular entities that never acquire a cytosolic localization and (2) it relies on single-membraned vesicles (Galluzzi et al., 2017a) . Moreover, LAP occurs independently of unc-51 like autophagy-activating kinase 1 (ULK1), autophagy and beclin 1 regulator 1 (AMBRA1), ATG14, and RB1-inducible coiled-coil 1", "cite_spans": [{"start":

Thus, the deletion of Becn1, Atg5, or Atg7 (but not Rb1cc1) from myeloid cells drives an autoimmune disorder similar to human systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), which can be recapitulated by the whole-body knockout of Rubcn but not by that of Ulk1 (Martinez et al., 2016) . Similarly, the myeloid cellspecific deletion of Becn1, Pik3c3, Atg5, Atg7, or Atg16l1 (but not Rb1cc1 or Atg14) as well as the whole-body knockout of Rbcn or Cybb (coding for a subunit of NADPH oxidase 2), but not Ulk1, promotes anti-tumor T cell immunity as a consequence of improved inflammatory responses to dead cell corpses (Cunha et al., 2018) . In the retinal epithelium, BECN1, ATG5, RUBCN, and LC3 are required for the phagocytosis of photoreceptor outer segments (POS), which is fundamental for normal vision (Kim et al., 2013; Muniz-Feliciano et al., 2017) . This process, however, occurs independently of ULK1, ATG13, and FIP200, which are all required for conventional autophagic responses (Kim et al., 2013) . Thus, at least some of the phenotypes originating from the depletion of the aforementioned proteins may stem from defects in LAP, not autophagy, especially in the context of pathogen control and disposal of cell corpses (Heckmann et al., 2017) . Interestingly, the orthologs of ATG9 and ATG16L1 also mediate autophagy-independent pro-phagocytic effects in Dictyostelium discoideum, a simple eukaryote that transitions from unicellular to multicellular life over the course of its vital cycle (Tung et al., 2010; Xiong et al., 2015) . Along with the notion that autophagy is conserved in both unicellular eukaryotes and plants (\u00dc st\u00fc n et al., 2017) , this observation suggests that both the autophagy-dependent and autophagy-independent functions of the autophagic machinery may have appeared early during evolution.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 177, "end": 200, "text": "(Fletcher et al., 2018;", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 201, "end": 222, "text": "Martinez et al., 2015", "ref_id": "BIBREF72"}, {"start": 223, "end": 246, "text": "Martinez et al., , 2016", "ref_id": "BIBREF73"}, {"start": 247, "end": 264, "text": "Rai et al., 2018)", "ref_id": "BIBREF99"}, {"start": 516, "end": 539, "text": "(Martinez et al., 2016)", "ref_id": "BIBREF73"}, {"start": 871, "end": 891, "text": "(Cunha et al., 2018)", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1061, "end": 1079, "text": "(Kim et al., 2013;", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}, {"start": 1080, "end": 1109, "text": "Muniz-Feliciano et al., 2017)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1245, "end": 1263, "text": "(Kim et al., 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}, {"start": 1486, "end": 1509, "text": "(Heckmann et al., 2017)", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 1758, "end": 1777, "text": "(Tung et al., 2010;", "ref_id": "BIBREF131"}, {"start": 1778, "end": 1797, "text": "Xiong et al., 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF138"}, {"start": 1892, "end": 1914, "text": "(\u00dc st\u00fc n et al., 2017)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Figure 2.

Mice with conditional Ulk1/Ulk2 co-deletion in the brain surviving the first 24 h after birth resemble their Atg5-and Atg7-deficient counterparts as they display abnormal limb-clasping reflexes, but they do not develop cerebellar ataxia, suggesting that the neuronal phenotype caused by the lack of Ulk1 and Ulk2 may not result from an autophagic defect . Indeed, Ulk1 \u00c0/\u00c0 Ulk2 \u00c0/\u00c0 neurons do not exhibit accumulation of autophagic substrates such as sequestosome 1 (SQSTM1, best known as p62) but manifest signs of the unfolded protein response Wang et al., 2018) , an intracellular pathway of adaptation to accumulation of unfolded polypeptides in the ER lumen (Galluzzi et al., 2018b) . Consistently, both ULK1 and ULK2 can phosphorylate SEC16 homolog A, endoplasmic reticulum export factor (SEC16A) to drive the anterograde transport of ER-derived vesicles to the GA, and this pathway is insensitive to depletion of ATG13 (which is required for the pro-autophagic functions of ULKs), ATG14, and ATG7 . Of note, neurodegeneration imposed by Ulk1/Ulk2 co-deletion is also accompanied by defective axonal pathfinding affecting multiple areas of the forebrain, and similar alterations cannot be recapitulated by the brain-specific deletion of Atg7 or Rb1cc1 . However, to what extent these defects in axonal projection reflect secretory alterations in post-synaptic cells as opposed to primary deficiencies in pre-synaptic cells remains to be clarified. In apparent contrast with the observations discussed here above, ULK1 is not required for the secretion of type I interferon (IFN) by plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) exposed to DNA-immunoglobulin complexes, whereas ATG7 is required (Henault et al., 2012) . In this setting, however, ATG7 does not promote anterograde ER-to-GA vesicle trafficking but enables pDCs to take up DNA-immunoglobulin complexes via LAP, followed by Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) signaling at acidified phagosomes (Henault et al., 2012) . Intriguingly, Atg1, the ortholog of mammalian ULK1 in Drosophila melanogaster, is also involved in JNK-driven secretion of mitogens that underlies apoptosis-induced compensatory proliferation, an effect that does not depend on multiple other components of the autophagy machinery in flies including Atg3, Atg6 (the BECN1 ortholog), Atg8 (the LC3 ortholog), and Vps34 . Moreover, Caenorhabditis elegans lacking the worm homolog of mammalian ULK1 (i.e., unc-51) display axonal defects that resemble those of Ulk1 \u00c0/\u00c0 Ulk2 \u00c0/\u00c0 neurons (Hedgecock et al., 1985) .

In this context, secretory alterations reflect the inability of goblet cells lacking Atg5, Atg7, or Map1lc3b to produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) in sufficient amounts to drive granule exocytosis, secondary to a defect in the formation of NADPH oxidase-competent subcellular compartments at the interface between autophagosomes and endosomes (Patel et al., 2013) . Along similar lines, cells unable to form non-conventional ATG3-ATG12 conjugates, which are formed by ATG7 but are not involved in bona fide autophagic responses, accumulate autophagosomes and late endosomes in baseline conditions, coupled to reduced exosomal output (Murrow et al., 2015) . A similar phenotype results from the deletion of Atg5 or Atg16l1 (but not Atg7 or Atg14) from mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) as well as from the deletion of ATG5 from human breast cancer cells, where it limits exosome-driven metastatic dissemination (Guo et al., 2017) . However, in the former setting, ATG3-ATG12 appears to drive exosome secretion upon interaction with the exosomal protein programmed cell death 6 interacting protein (PDCD6IP, best known as ALIX) (Murrow et al., 2015) , while in the latter scenario, ATG5 appears to disrupt endosomal acidification by disassociating the V 1 V 0 -ATPase, resulting in diversion of late endosomes toward secretion (rather than lysosomal degradation) (Guo et al., 2017) . In some cases, ATG7 seems to be required for optimal exosome release (potentially linked to its role in ATG3-ATG12 conjugation) (Murrow et al., 2015; Shrivastava et al., 2015) , while in other settings, exosome release operates normally in the absence of ATG7 (Guo et al., 2017; Sahu et al., 2011) .

One of the substrates of non-conventional secretion is mature interleukin 1 beta (IL1B, best known as IL-1b), which is produced in the cytosol of cells with pro-inflammatory activity (like macrophages) upon proteolytic maturation of the IL-1b precursor by the NLRP3 inflammasome (Rathinam and Fitzgerald, 2016) . Bone-marrow-derived macrophages treated with nigericin (an inflammasome activator) secrete increased amounts of IL-1b in conditions of nutrient deprivation (as compared with nigericin-treated macrophages maintained in control conditions), and IL-1b secretion can be quenched by Atg5 deletion (Dupont et al., 2011) . ATG5-dependent IL-1b secretion appears to rely on recognition of two KFERQ-like motifs by heat shock protein 90 alpha family class A member 1 (HSP90AA1), resulting in the relocalization of IL-1b between autophagosomal membranes, potentially explaining why IL-1b does not undergo degradation within autolysosomes in this context . Another (hitherto untested) possibility is that ATG5 may prevent IL-1b degradation by subverting autolysosomal acidification, reminiscent of the non-autophagic pathway whereby ATG5 regulates exosome production (Guo et al., 2017) . It has been proposed that IL-1b release ultimately depends on the fusion between autophagosomes or autolysosomes and the plasma membrane (Kimura et al., 2017) . However, this model cannot be easily reconciled with the fact that gasdermin D (GSDMD), a core component of the molecular mechanism for pyroptosis (Box 2), is also required for IL-1b secretion by macrophages (Heilig et al., 2018) .

In particular, ATG16L1, ATG7, LC3, p62, and calcium binding and coiled-coil domain 2 (CALCOCO2, another protein involved in cargo selection, best known as NDP52) cooperate to encapsulate cytoplasmic Toxoplasma gondii (a eukaryotic parasite) in multi-membraned vesicles that efficiently blunt parasite replication but do not fuse with endosomes or lysosomes (Selleck et al., 2015) . In this context, ATG5 appears to promote the recruitment of an IFN-g-responsive GTPase to parasite-encapsulating vesicles, which is required for the optimal anti-infectious effects of IFN-g (Zhao et al., 2008) . It remains unclear whether the autophagy-independent functions of ATG16L1 and ATG5 in the control of T. gondii infection require the formation of the ATG12-ATG5-ATG16L1 complex. In partial support of this possibility, both ATG7, which catalyzes the ATG12-ATG5 conjugation, and the ATG12-ATG5-ATG16L1 complex are required for the control of murine norovirus infection by macrophages exposed to IFN-g (Hwang et al., 2012) , via a mechanism that does not rely on ATG4-dependent LC3 processing, autophagosome-lysosome fusion, or lysosomal degradation (Hwang et al., 2012) .

In this setting, ATG5 mediates autophagy-independent functions that prevent the development of severe lung inflammation driven by the release of multiple cytokines by polymorphic mononuclear cells (PMNs) (Kimmey et al., 2015) . Consistent with this, mice with a LYZ2-restricted deletion of Atg5 (as well as mice where Atg5 is deleted only in PMNs) succumb prematurely to M. tuberculosis infection, and this can be rescued by PMN depletion (Kimmey et al., 2015) . The precise molecular mechanisms linking ATG5 to reduced inflammatory responses in PMNs challenged to M. tuberculosis remain obscure. However, because ATG7, ATG12, and ATG16L1 are not involved in this process (Kimmey et al., 2015) , the findings outlined above raise the intriguing possibility that bona fide autophagic responses may be detrimental in this setting as they could limit the availability of unbound ATG5.

RCD occurs in both fully physiological and pathological settings. In the former case, RCD is instrumental to organismal development and homeostasis, as it ensures organ morphogenesis and adult tissue turnover. In the latter case, RCD is a consequence of failing adaptation to stress. That said, stress-driven RCD can also be viewed as a mechanism for the maintenance of organismal homeostasis, as it underlies the removal of damaged, non-functional, and potentially oncogenic cells (Galluzzi et al., 2018b) . The molecular mechanisms whereby mammalian cells undergo RCD in physiological and pathological scenarios exhibit considerable overlap. Extrinsic apoptosis is a form of RCD initiated by plasma membrane receptors through activation of CASP8, and precipitated by CASP3 or other executioner caspases, like CASP6 or CASP7. Intrinsic apoptosis also relies on CASP3, CASP6, or CASP7, but it is initiated by perturbations of intracellular homeostasis culminating with activation of pro-apoptotic BH3-only proteins and BAX-or BAK1-dependent mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP). Mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT)-driven regulated necrosis (RN) is initiated by the opening of a mitochondrial supramolecular entity known as permeability transition pore complex (PTPC) in response to oxidative stress or cytosolic Ca 2+ overload and is precipitated by peptidylprolyl isomerase F (PPIF, best known as CYPD). Parthanatos is a form of regulated necrosis impinging on PARP1 hyperactivation, which entails a bioenergetic catastrophe coupled to the release of apoptosis-inducing factor mitochondria associated 1 (AIFM1; best known as AIF) from mitochondria and its translocation to the nucleus, where it mediates nucleolytic effects. Necroptosis is regulated by the RIPK3-dependent (and in some instances RIPK1regulated) phosphorylation of MLKL, resulting in the formation of plasma-membrane-permeabilizing MLKL pores. Ferroptosis is triggered by oxidative perturbations, relies on lipid peroxidation, and is under tonic control by glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4). Pyroptosis is a form of RN impinging on the cleavage or gasdermin family members, such as gasdermin D (GSDMD) or GSDME, by inflammatory (i.e., CASP1, CASP4, CASP5, or CASP11) and apoptotic (i.e., CASP3) caspases often occurring in the context of IL-1b and IL-18 secretion. Lysosome-dependent cell death (LDCD) is a form of RCD demarcated by primary lysosomal membrane permeabilization (LMP) and precipitated by cathepsins, such as cathepsin B (CTSB) and CTSD. Finally, autophagy-dependent cell death (ADCD) relies on one of multiple components of the autophagy machinery (Galluzzi et al., 2018a) . Of note, the etiological involvement of lysosomal degradation of autophagy substrates in ADCD has not been exhaustively verified, at least in mammalian settings. Thus, several variants of ADCD may actually constitute autophagy-independent pathways under the control of one or more components of the molecular apparatus for autophagy. Rybstein et al., 2018) . Indeed, while several instances of regulated cell death (RCD) (Box 2) rely on one or multiple autophagy-relevant proteins, hence constituting forms of autophagy-dependent cell death (ADCD) according to recent nomenclature guidelines (Galluzzi et al., 2018a) , in none of these cases does ADCD involve lysosomal degradation. Thus, at odds with ADCD in lower eukaryotes, which involves bona fide autophagic degradation (Berry and Baehrecke, 2007; Denton et al., 2009) , ADCD in mammals stands out as an autophagy-independent pathway under the control of the autophagy machinery. Neurons subjected to ischemic conditions and various human cancer cell lines exposed to nutrient deprivation or to a cell-permeant peptide that displaces BECN1 from inhibitory interactions with BCL2, apoptosis regulator (BCL2) (Box 1) undergo a variant of ADCD that relies on the plasma membrane Na + /K + ATPase, which has been dubbed autosis (Liu et al., 2013) . Accordingly, neriifolin (a Na + /K + ATPase inhibitor of the family of cardiac glycosides) mediates robust neuroprotective effects in rats experiencing cerebral hypoxia-ischemia (Liu et al., 2013) . Autosis occurs irrespective of BCL2-associated X, apoptosis regulator (BAX)-or BCL2 antagonist/killer 1 (BAK1)-dependent mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP) (Liu et al., 2013) , and hence, it does not constitute a form of apoptotic cell death. Rather, autosis relies on ATG5, ATG7, ATG12, ATG14, and BECN1 as well as the PI3K activity of VPS34 (Liu et al., 2013) . However, pharmacological inhibition of lysosomal functions fails to rescue human cervical carcinoma HeLa cells from autosis (Liu et al., 2013) , strongly suggesting that autosis occurs independently of bona fide autophagic responses.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 150, "end": 174, "text": "(Galluzzi et al., 2018a)", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 659, "end": 683, "text": "(Galluzzi et al., 2018b)", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 2830, "end": 2854, "text": "(Galluzzi et al., 2018a)", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 3191, "end": 3213, "text": "Rybstein et al., 2018)", "ref_id": "BIBREF108"}, {"start": 3449, "end": 3473, "text": "(Galluzzi et al., 2018a)", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 3633, "end": 3660, "text": "(Berry and Baehrecke, 2007;", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 3661, "end": 3681, "text": "Denton et al., 2009)", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 4137, "end": 4155, "text": "(Liu et al., 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF68"}, {"start": 4336, "end": 4354, "text": "(Liu et al., 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF68"}, {"start": 4531, "end": 4549, "text": "(Liu et al., 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF68"}, {"start": 4718, "end": 4736, "text": "(Liu et al., 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF68"}, {"start": 4863, "end": 4881, "text": "(Liu et al., 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF68"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Box 2.

Immunity-related GTPase M (IRGM), the only human paralog of a large cluster of murine IFN-g-regulated genes (Bekpen et al., 2005) , not only participates in the autophagic control of M. tuberculosis driven by IFN-g (Singh et al., 2006) but, upon infection, also translocates to mitochondria to initiate MOMP (Singh et al., 2010) . Importantly, RCD caused by IRGM occurs irrespective of BECN1 or ATG7 but can be rescued by co-deletion of Bax and Bak1 (Singh et al., 2010) . Whether the ability of IRGM to trigger MOMP depends on a direct physical interaction with BAX and/ or BAK1 versus the inactivation of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members remains to be elucidated. This latter mechanism accounts for the pro-apoptotic effects of ATG12 (Rubinstein et al., 2011) . Indeed, ATG12 contains a bona fide BH3 domain that enables ATG12 to interact with BCL2 and MCL1, BCL2 family apoptosis regulator (MCL1), ultimately resulting in BAX/BAK1dependent RCD irrespective of ATG3, ATG4, and ATG5 (Haller et al., 2014; Rubinstein et al., 2011) . Both BECN1 and AMBRA1 also contain a bona fide BH3 domain (Oberstein et al., 2007; Strappazzon et al., 2016) . However, while interaction between BECN1 and BCL2 or BCL2-like 1 (BCL2L1, best known as BCL-X L ) mainly regulates autophagic responses (Maiuri et al., 2007; Pattingre et al., 2005) , a cleavage product of AMBRA1 generated over the course of apoptosis appears to precipitate RCD upon BCL2 binding (Strappazzon et al., 2016) . The reasons underlying such a discrepancy are unclear but may relate to the differential binding affinity of the AMBRA1 and BECN1 BH3 domains for Bcl-2 family members. BECN1 also competes with MCL1 for stabilization by ubiquitin specific peptidase 9 X-linked (USP9X) (Elgendy et al., 2014) . In this setting, increased levels of MCL1 limit BECN1 deubiquitination, hence favoring BECN1 proteasomal degradation. Such a simultaneous inhibition of autophagy and apoptosis has been documented in progressing melanomas (Elgendy et al., 2014) .

Similarly, a truncated variant of UVRAG expressed by some CRCs has been associated with an autophagy-independent DNA repair defect and consequent increased sensitivity to genotoxic chemotherapy (He et al., 2015) .
