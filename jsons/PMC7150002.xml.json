Waterborne diseases should not be seen as an independent part of the infectious disease cycle, but as a vehicle for their transmission. While we assume that a significant proportion of these gastrointestinal illnesses may be waterborne, we have no data to estimate the proportion of the overall burden of disease they represent (Figure 13.1\n). In a holistic approach, a reduction of waterborne disease should also result in a measurable reduction of the overall rate of gastrointestinal illnesses (Mara and Cairncross, 1989). This is the result of limiting person-to-person transmission and also the result of reducing the risk of the contamination of foods by contaminated water or individuals that have been infected through drinking water (Figure 13.2\n).",

These reports emphasize the fact that access to water and water quality are in direct relationship to life expectancy and child mortality, as countries with poor access to drinking water have the highest morbidity rates in children under 5 years of age.",

Others are just emerging as being implicated in diseases transmitted by the water route (LeChevallier et al., 1999a,b). Urbanization, ageing of water treatment plants, increasing numbers of immunocompromised individuals and ageing populations are potential causes for an increased risk of waterborne infectious diseases (Ford and Colwell, 1996; Fewtrell and Bartram, 2001). As we will see later, the endemic level of disease due to drinking-water consumption has also been shown to be quite significant and it contributes to maintaining these pathogens in the affected populations. The dilemma of balancing microbial and cancer health risks is also a difficult one to resolve, but it should not result in a reduction of treatment efficiency. The low risk level for cancer is insignificant when compared to the risk of waterborne infectious disease in absence of adequate water treatment (Payment and Hartemann, 1998; Fewtrell and Bartram, 2001).",

Waterborne diseases are usually described in terms of outbreak reporting in the various countries and the USA has produced most of the available data through the decades-long effort of Gunther Craun (Craun, 1984, 1986, 1990) and a continuous effort to collect data (Herwaldt et al., 1991, 1992). In other countries, data gathering is often performed very poorly because of lack of resources to identify the water-related events as well as the lack of centralized data gathering official authorities (Andersson and Bohan, 2001). Several methods for the detection and investigation of waterborne outbreaks have been described, but are still not widely used (Craun, 1990; Andersson and Bohan, 2001) as resources and funds are critically lacking, even in industrialized countries (Fewtrell and Bartram, 2001). An enormous effort is needed to educate all on the importance of water in the dissemination of disease. All levels of society, from consumer to politicians, must be educated to the necessity of improving water quality (Ford and Colwell, 1996) as a major step in improving the quality of life and health.",

The recognition that giardiasis was waterborne, with numerous outbreaks in the USA (Craun, 1986) and several outbreaks of cryptosporidiosis in England (Badenoch, 1990a,b) and in many other countries (Payment and Hunter, 2001) have now shifted the focus to these parasites, which are extremely resistant to the water disinfection process. Dozens of outbreaks of cryptosporidiosis have now been reported world-wide, but most are small compared to the explosive outbreak experienced in Milwaukee (USA) in the spring of 1993 (Edwards, 1993; Mackenzie et al., 1994). Following what appears to be a failure in treatment, water that met the United States Environmental Protection Agency water quality guidelines may have caused gastrointestinal illnesses in over 400 000 people or one-third of the population of this city over a period of one month. Most of these illnesses were cryptosporidiosis, but many were probably of viral origin and the number of illnesses reported may have been overestimated by 100-fold (Hunter and Syed, 2001). The most surprising aspect of this event is that cryptosporidiosis was probably occurring even before it was detected following a report from an inquisitive pharmacist (Morris et al., 1998). This suggests that unless an effort is made to identify waterborne diseases they will remain undetected, buried in the endemic level of illness in the population (Payment and Hunter, 2001).",

Even infectious disease specialists often forget that enteric microorganisms are associated with a wide range of symptoms and diseases (Table 13.1\n). Protozoan parasites, such as amoebae, can cause severe liver or brain infections and contact lens wearers are warned of the dangers of eye infections. Bacteria can cause pneumonia (Legionella) and some are suggesting the possibility that Helicobacter pylori, which has been associated with gastric ulcers, could be transmitted by the water route. Among the 72 known enteroviruses, many can induce illnesses other than gastrointestinal, such as hepatitis (viral type A or E), poliomyelitis, viral meningitis, enteroviral carditis, epidemic myalgia, diabetes, ocular diseases. Some viruses can also induce abortions, stillbirth and fetal abnormalities (Payment, 1993a,b).

This study is typical of most studies which relied on the detection of epidemics to assess the level of water quality: they do not address the endemic level of gastrointestinal illnesses which may be due to low level contamination of the water. The same group, in a prospective follow-up study on 48 villages for 64 weeks, has evaluated the gastrointestinal illneses associated with untreated ground water and found a relationship between faecal streptococci and acute gastrointestinal disease (Ferley et al., 1986; Zmirou et al., 1987). Faecal coliforms did not appear to be related to acute disease. Total coliforms and total bacteria had no independent contributions to disease but, even in the absence of all measured indicator germs, one-fourth of the cases were still observed.",

The gastrointestinal symptomatology was evaluated by means of a family health diary maintained prospectively by all study families. The estimated annual incidence of gastrointestinal illness was 0.76 among tap-water drinkers as compared with 0.50 among RO-filtered-water drinkers (P < 0.01). Because participants in the RO-filter group were still exposed to tap water (i.e. about 40% of their water intake was tap water), it was estimated that about 50% of the illnesses were probably tap water-related and preventable.

It has now become an important part of the preparation of guidelines for water quality in all countries (Fewtrell and Bartram, 2001). In their current rule-making process, the USA have incorporated an important place to microbial risk assessment (Regli et al., 1991; Sobsey et al., 1993) and all agencies world-wide are now debating the balance to be maintained between chemical risks and microbial risks (Fewtrell and Bartram, 2001). It is now recognized that the chemical risk reduction objective should never result in a decrease in water disinfection (Guerra de Macedo 1993; WHO 1996; Fewtrell and Bartram, 2001). This could have catastrophic implications as was experienced during the 1991 cholera outbreak in South America. It is important to remember that differentiation between developed and developing countries is an arbitrary process when drinking water safety is considered. Problems and solutions vary from country to country, a fact that must be taken into account when formulating solutions.",
