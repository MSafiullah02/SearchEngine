This paper describes a mathematical model that allows simulating the shape of a coronavirus with a given number of spike proteins. Also the effect of the spike proteins number on the scattered light characteristics, such as intensity and the degree of linear polarization, it is studied.

Therefore, we will try to synthesize the spike protein with a fairly smooth algebraic function. In particular, the spike can be described using the following equation:(2)h=1\u03c0arctan(2\u03c0nk\u2212n|\u03b8\u2212\u03b80|)+12,where h is the relative spike height, \u03b8 is a polar angle, \u03b80 is a position of spike over polar angle (suggesting, that azimuthal angle and azimuthal position are the same \u03c6 = \u03c60), k is the parameter, determining the width of spike, and n describes how close to the rectangle the spike shape is.

In principle, this method can be used to study the light scattering characteristics of particles of any shape. In this work, calculations were performed by modification of the T-matrix method (the so-called Sh-matrices method, or the shape matrices method). This approach makes it possible to considerably simplify the calculations of arbitrary shape particles. The Sh-matrix technique [19], [20] has been developed to study light scattering of irregular particles, comparable with wavelength, with different shapes. Moreover, analytical expressions for the calculation of Sh-matrix elements of arbitrary shaped particles were found [21], [22], [23], [24], [25]. The Sh-matrix elements depend only on particle morphology and are found by performing surface integrals. Size and refractive index dependences are incorporated through analytical operations on the Sh-matrix to produce the T-matrix.",

An interesting polarization feature is observed in the spectral region of about 200 nm.

This feature is clearly manifested in spherical particles and is called the Quasi\u2013Rayleigh polarization leap (QRPL) [29].

It's because spikes begin to exhibit non-Rayleigh scattering at wavelength decreasing, which means more and more depolarize light. In principle, depolarization of light scattered by model particles is associated with light scattering between the spikes, i.e. with multiple scattering, which always depolarizes light. Moreover, this multiple scattering will be more pronounced for spikes comparable to the wavelength than for those that are much smaller than the wavelength.
