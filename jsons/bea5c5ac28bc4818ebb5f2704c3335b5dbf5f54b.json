ProMED-mail is a global electronic reporting system, open to all sources, for outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases and diseases resulting from toxin exposure. It is a moderated listserv that covers plant, animal, and human diseases. Subscriptions are free, and there is a freely accessible website at: http://www.promedmail.org. ProMEDmail is a program activity of the International Society of Infectious Diseases and is a not-for-profit, non-governmental organization (NGO). This independent status permits ProMED to function without political constraints. (This translates into the ability to post reports without requiring the permission of a government to do so.)",

This applies to human diseases as well as animal and plant diseases. Animal diseases covered include zoonotic diseases with known or suspected human disease potential, as well as purely animal diseases for their ultimate impact on economies and that pertaining to food security. Similarly, plant diseases are covered for their known impact on human health as well as for economic and food security issues (Table 1 ). Estimates are that more than 70% of newly emerging diseases are zoonotic in origin, resulting in \"species jump\" from animal to humans [1, 4] . Recent examples of this include the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), avian influenza, Nipah virus encephalitis, spongiform encephalopathies, and monkeypox. Examples of increased response by the health community to heightened disease surveillance needs facilitated through the informal sector can be seen in the reporting of four recent outbreaks. \"Have you heard of an epidemic in Guangzhou? An acquaintance of mine from a teacher's chat room lives there and reports that the hospitals there have been closed and people are dying\" [5] .",

It has long been theorized that new human influenza strains evolve as species jumps by avian influenza viruses, which through genetic reassortment obtain human-to-human transmissibility genes [9] . The appearance of a new strain of avian influenza associated with human illness has been a serious concern on the part of the public health community, as a possible precursor to the next human influenza pandemic.

The accounts of the rumored outbreak emanate from 2 independent sources. Further information from any informed person or organization in the area would be appreciated [Mod.CP] [16] The reliable source providing this report was a veterinarian working in the affected area, who was concerned about political and professional repercussions for publicly reporting this outbreak. Job security concerns are often deterrents to international reporting. Through the use of the informal network, it was possible to alert the official sector of the suspicion of an avian influenza outbreak among poultry, without jeopardizing the reporting individual. The official report of an avian influenza outbreak ongoing in Indonesia was made to the OIE on 4 February 2004 [17] .
