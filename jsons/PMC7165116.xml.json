            "text": "Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is a reemerging swine enteropathogenic coronavirus belonging to the genus Alphacoronavirus of the family Coronaviridae. PEDV is the causative agent of porcine epidemic diarrhea, a condition that presents as severe diarrhea, vomiting, and dehydration. As PEDV is highly contagious, the resulting economic burden to the swine industry worldwide is substantial (Bertasio et al., 2016; Gerber et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2014a). Since December 2010, swine farms in China have seen large-scale outbreaks of PEDV infection with typical mortality rates of 50\u201390% in suckling piglets (Bi et al., 2012; Chen et al., 2012; Wei et al., 2012). In the United States, PEDV pandemic strains have caused more than 80 % mortality in suckling piglets and have been rapidly transmitted between farms since 2013. There were over 8 million piglets lost, which represents nearly 10 % of all U.S. farm piglets in 2014 (Stevenson et al., 2013). There were some new features of this PEDV epidemic, including the high mortality rates in suckling piglets. Another feature was the rapid occurrence of diarrhea, dehydration and death, not only in suckling piglets but also in finishing pigs. Numerous studies have focused on viral isolation and molecular epidemiology surveys (Park et al., 2012), which indicated that PEDV pandemic strains could rapidly replicate in vivo, cause damage to intestinal epithelial cells, and ultimately induce diarrhea, dehydration and death in both newborn piglets and finishing pigs.",

            "text": "PEDV is an enveloped, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus that is composed primarily of four structural proteins, the spike protein (S), membrane protein (M), envelope protein (E), and nucleocapsid protein (N), and 17 nonstructural proteins (nsp), nsp1-nsp16 and ORF3. The S protein is located on the surface of the virus particle and is a type I membrane fusion protein. S protein binds to receptors on the target cell, and then, the virus enters the cell through fusion with the plasma membrane or via endocytosis (Chang et al., 2002; Hou et al., 2019; Park et al., 2014; Supekar et al., 2004). Several viral proteins have a suppressive effect on innate immunity. The N protein directly interacts with TBK1, resulting in the inhibition of IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) activation and type I IFN production (Ding et al., 2014). Nsp1 blocks the nuclear translocation of IRF1, resulting in a reduction in peroxisomes and thereby suppressing IRF1-mediated type III IFNs (Zhang et al., 2017). Nsp5, a 3C-like protease, disrupts type I IFN signaling by cleaving NF-\u03baB essential modulator (NEMO), which is an essential adaptor that bridges interferon-regulatory factor and NF-\u03baB activation (Wang et al., 2015). Nsp6 of coronaviruses is integral membrane protein believed to be involved in double membrane vesicle (DMV) formation (Angelini et al., 2013; Oostra et al., 2008). Nsp6 of the infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) generates autophagosomes from the endoplasmic reticulum (Cottam et al., 2014).",

Autophagy is not only a physiological cellular pathway for self-degradation but also a defense mechanism that protects host cells against pathogen infection (Chiramel and Best, 2017; Maier et al., 2013; O\u2019Connell and Liang, 2016; Rozieres et al., 2017). Autophagy plays important roles in modulating viral replication and antiviral immune response (McFarlane et al., 2011; Mohl et al., 2012; Monastyrska et al., 2013; Paul and Munz, 2016; Radtke et al., 2013). Increasing evidence indicates that autophagy plays both anti-viral and pro-viral roles in the life cycles and pathogenesis of a wide range of viruses (Chiramel et al., 2013; Jackson, 2015; Zang et al., 2016). Previous studies have shown that coronavirus infection is associated with the autophagic process, and that the nonstructural proteins of coronavirus induce the formation of autophagosomes from the endoplasmic reticulum via an omegasome intermediate (Cottam et al., 2011).",

            "text": "PEDV pandemic strains can proliferate rapidly in vivo and cause damage to the intestinal epithelial cells of both newborn piglets and finishing pigs (Jung et al., 2015; Lin et al., 2016). Whether these biological effects are associated with autophagy is unclear. In our previous research, it was found that the PEDV pandemic strain could activate more significantly autophagy-related signaling pathway compared with the PEDV classical strain in intestinal porcine epithelial (IPEC-J2) cells, and the proliferation rate of the PEDV pandemic strain was significantly higher than that of the PEDV classical strain, which indicated that there may be a positive correlation between autophagy and PEDV replication (Lin et al., 2017). It was reported that autophagy was beneficial to PEDV replication in African green monkey kidney (Vero) cells, and the PEDV-induced autophagy exhibited a positive feedback loop with the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway (Guo et al., 2017). As an intestinal proliferated virus, the interactions between PEDV and the intestinal porcine epithelial cells are still unknown, which is extremely important for determining the pathogenic mechanism and immune regulatory interactions between PEDV and the host. Moreover, which proteins (structural or nonstructural proteins) are the key inducers of autophagy has yet to be explored. In this study, it was investigated the mechanisms by which PEDV infection affected IPEC-J2 cells autophagy, and by which autophagy affected PEDV replication in IPEC-J2 cells. The effects of structural and nonstructural proteins of PEDV on the process of PEDV-induced autophagy and the autophagy-related signaling pathway activated by PEDV replication were also examined.",

Cells were maintained in Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium (DMEM; Gibco, Life Technologies, USA) supplemented with 10 % heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS, Invitrogen, USA) at 37 \u00b0C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. The PEDV strain used in this study, YC2014 (GenBank: KU252649.1), was isolated in our laboratory from a sucking piglet with acute diarrhea, and was propagated in IPEC-J2 cells. PEDV was made replication-incompetent by irradiating 10 mL of suspended virus, dispensed to form a layer of fluid in an open cell culture dish, with UV light for 5 h with gentle shaking at intervals. The absence of virus replication after UV treatment was confirmed by indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA). The monoclonal antibody (mAb) 3A6 anti-PEDV N protein was prepared in our laboratory. Rapamycin, hydroxychloroquine, and anti-LC3 antibody were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (Shanghai, China). The Akt-specific inhibitor GSK690693 was obtained from Selleck (Shanghai, China). The lentivirus LV-mRFP-GFP-LC3 was obtained from Hanbio (HB-LP210 0001, Shanghai, China) (Chen et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2014b; Xu et al., 2014). The LV-mRFP-GFP-LC3 double fluorescence labeling indicating system produces mRFP to label LC3, and the decrease of GFP indicates the fusion of lysosomes and autophagosomes to form autolysosomes, which is due to the sensitivity of GFP to acid. Thus, when autophagosomes fuses with lysosomes, GFP fluorescence is quenched and only RFP fluorescence can be detected. The yellow spots shown after red and green fluorescence merge together in microscope imaging indicate autophagosomes. The red spots indicate autolysosomes. The intensity of the autophagy flux can be clearly observed by counting the spots in different colors. The primary antibodies against mTOR, phospho-mTOR, p70S6K, phospho-p70S6K, p53, phospho-p53, and \u03b2-actin were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (CA, USA), or Cell Signaling Technology (MA, USA).",

The proteins were detected using an anti-LC3 antibody that recognizes both LC3-II and LC3-I, and an anti-PEDV N-protein monoclonal antibody.

            "text": "The role of autophagy in the viral infection process has been widely investigated (Lv et al., 2015; Paul and Munz, 2016). While autophagy may eliminate viruses from the host cell by delivering them to the lysosomal compartment for degradation (Hernaez et al., 2013), many viruses, such as human cytomegalovirus and herpes simplex virus type 1, have developed mechanisms to block autophagy, or to utilize the process for their benefit, (Yordy and Iwasaki, 2013). Viruses such as classical swine fever virus, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus, and rotavirus utilize the membranes of autophagosome-like vesicles during replication (Crawford et al., 2012). New PED outbreaks caused by PEDV pandemic strains have been documented in China since late 2010 and are now distributed all over the world. It was characterized by acute enteric infection and high mortality in suckling piglets and finishing pigs. In this study, we demonstrated that PEDV replication triggers autophagy in IPEC-J2 cells and that autophagy enhances replication of PEDV. It was also demonstrated that PEDV structural proteins (S, M, E, N) are not sufficient to trigger autophagy, and the nonstructural proteins (nsp1-nsp16 and ORF3) of PEDV are required in autophagy programs. These results were consistent with previous research on PEDV-induced autophagy in Vero cells by Guo X. et al. (Guo et al., 2017). However, Ko S. et al. reported that PEDV infection is suppressed in IPEC-J2 cells by an increase in autophagy induced by rapamycin (Ko et al., 2017). These different results might occur because of the different degrees of virulence of different PEDV strains. By expressing all 4 structural proteins and 17 nsps of PEDV in eukaryotic cells, we found that autophagy was triggered by the expression of nsp6 or ORF3, but not by the expression of the other proteins, in IPEC-J2 cells.",

During coronavirus infection, the formation of DMVs is believed to be associated with autophagy (Angelini et al., 2013; Blanchard and Roingeard, 2015). This observation was supported by the increased expression of autophagic marker proteins during PEDV replication. Using PEDV that was rendered replication-incompetent (but still infectious) by UV irradiation, it was found that viral replication induces autophagy. The LV-mRFP-GFP-LC3 lentivirus was used to measure the autophagic flux. The green fluorescence of this tandem autophagosome reporter is attenuated in the acidic pH of the lysosome by lysosomal hydrolysis, whereas the red fluorescence is not. In PEDV-infected cells, the autophagosomes exhibit both GFP and mRFP signals, whereas autolysosomes exhibit only mRFP signals.",

Infectious bronchitis virus is able to induce autophagy but does not require autophagy for its replication (Maier et al., 2013). Transmissible gastroenteritis virus infection induces autophagy, which negatively regulates its replication (Guo et al., 2016). In this study, the impact of autophagy on PEDV replication was examined by using a pharmacological enhancer and a pharmacological suppressor of autophagy. The PEDV yield was suppressed when autophagy was inhibited by hydroxychloroquine at an early stage, while the viral titers were increased when autophagy was induced by rapamycin. These results suggest that autophagy enhances PEDV replication in IPEC-J2 cells.",

It was reported that transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) infection activates the NF-\u03baB pathway in porcine intestinal epithelial cells and results in severe inflammation (Wang et al., 2018a). The differentially expressed mRNAs and ncRNAs in mock- and TGEV-infected IPEC-J2 cells were primarily enriched in inflammation-related pathways, and ssc_circ_009380 promoted the activation of the NF-\u03baB pathway by binding to miR-22 during TGEV-induced inflammation (Ma et al., 2018). SARS-coronavirus can mediate myocardial inflammation and damage that are associated with the downregulation of the myocardial ACE2 system, which may be responsible for the myocardial dysfunction and adverse cardiac outcomes in patients with SARS (Oudit et al., 2009). In our previous studies, PEDV pandemic strains induced both autophagy-related and inflammation-related signaling pathways more significantly than the PEDV classical strains in IPEC-J2 cells (Lin et al., 2017). This may be associated with the rapid proliferation of PEDV pandemic strains in vivo, which induces inflammatory cytokine storms in intestinal epithelial cells and ultimately results in rapid damage to intestinal epithelial cells and the occurrence of diarrhea, dehydration and death. The mutual relationships between the autophagy and inflammation induced by PEDV pandemic strains will be studied in our following research.",

The relationship between autophagy and PEDV replication was further confirmed through RNAi experiments, in which the endogenous p53 gene was specifically silenced.
