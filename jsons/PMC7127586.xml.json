            "text": "The isolated networks are widely investigated to study the relationship between network topology and network activity [1]. Nevertheless, in practice, a network is usually classified into several communities while a community is composed of a group of nodes in the network while the community is more densely connected than with the other nodes of the network. For instance, the World-wide Airport Network is composed of Airport Network of US, Airport Network of India, Airport Network of China and so forth. Moreover, community detection methods are presented and standards are proposed in order to measure the community partition [2], [3], [4]. This indicates most networks are not isolated but interacting with each other, being referred to as a network of networks (NoN). Within each individual network, the connectivity links are maintained to represent various connections (often called inter-contacts); whereas links are added to connect each network to others (being referred to as intra-contacts) [5]. This type of networks is capable of modeling a number of real-world systems, for instance, the European air transport system [6], the global cargo ship network [7], living organisms [8], [9], [10] and social networks [11], [12].",

In [16], [17], a two-layered multiplex network is presented in order to analyze the epidemic spreading process, while the application of this two-layered network model is also thoroughly investigated [18], [19]. In this model, the two layers are referred to as a virtual layer and a physical one respectively. The physical layer is composed of individuals while the links represent the corresponding practical body contacts. For the virtual layer, it is consisting of virtual nodes (with each node corresponding to an individual on the physical layer); here, the connections indicate relationships incurred by various social ties, such as phone call, twitter, Wechat and etc. On the virtual layer, the information about the epidemic is spreading among nodes; whereas on the physical layer, biological elements carrying the virus of epidemic are exchanged among individuals through physical contacts.",

In [21], the SIR model is adopted for the analysis of epidemic spreading process in multilayered networks. While in [14], the SIS model is applied to investigate the epidemic spreading process in multilayered networks. Furthermore, in [22], the SIS model is investigated in multiplex networks using a contact-contagion formulation. While in order to improve the evaluation efficiency, stochastic analysis is performed to predict the long run behaviors of multiplex networks with the adoption of the proposed stochastic architectures for SIS model in [23]. For this class of disease as H1N1 (Swine Influenza), H5H1 (Avian Influenza) or the SEVERE Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) [24], the favorite approach to describe the spreading process is the SIR model. For SIR model, an infected individual is able to be recovered from an infected state due to the effect of medical treatments or self-rehabilitation.",

As indicated by previous studies, the disparity of different summits is likely to be affected by a number of factors, such as infectivity probabilities, recovery probability, network topology and etc. Nevertheless, it is still of great interest to investigate the problem of minimizing the range of individuals being affected by the epidemic. Hence, in this manuscript, the evolution process is further investigated which is spreading in two intra-connected communities.

This is due to the different nodes being selected for initial infection and the stochastic fluctuations of simulation based approaches. Furthermore, disparity of the summits of the epidemic spreading process in different communities is also presented in Table 3\nfor different experiments. Here, five simulations are conducted and presented for simplicity. As shown by the obtained time step of the summits, we can see the summit for communities without the virtual layer always comes later than that for the scenario with virtual layer. This indicates that the incorporation of virtual layer is able to postpone the summit of the epidemic spreading process. Furthermore, as indicated by the results, for the scenario with virtual layer, the average value of disparity is obtained as 37.4; nevertheless, if the virtual layer is not incorporated, the corresponding average value is obtained as 20. This shows the disparity between two summits is likely to be enlarged if the virtual layer is investigated.",

For each community, a two-layered multiplex network model is adopted, i.e., virtual layer and physical layer, to investigate the epidemic spreading process. In this manuscript, the SIR model is adopted to describe the infectious process. If virtual layer is incorporated, then corresponding state transition tree is derived. Then, MC simulation is performed to investigate the epidemic spreading process. As indicated, the incorporation of virtual layer is capable of reducing the proportion of infected individuals to a large extent. This is consistent with common sense as individuals are more likely to take protective measures if they already know the epidemic. Furthermore, the occurrence of the maximum value of the transition process in certain community can be postponed if the virtual layer is considered. Moreover, the difference between the summits of different trends is able to be reduced greatly by incorporating the virtual layer.",
