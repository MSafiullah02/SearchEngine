Related works are examinable from two aspects: 1- proposing a new optimization algorithm aspect, and 2- the motif discovery aspect. Some of the imminent optimization algorithms which were proposed during the last decades are listed as follows. The genetic algorithm was inspired by living organisms\u2019 evolutionary process [1]. A large number of modified genetic algorithms were proposed with a different crossover, mutation, and distinct selection operations [2]. A new optimization algorithm for a single hidden layer of feedback on a neural network, based on the genetic and convex combination algorithms, was introduced by Kwan et al. The most important characteristic of their algorithm was that it could get an acceptable answer in more reasonable time order compared with the others [3]. A new optimization algorithm, known as SOS, was introduced by Min-Yuan et al. to study living organisms. Obtained results proved the SOS\u2019s good performance [4]. A combination of imperialist competitive and bee colony algorithms which was recently introduced led to a new method for an optimization problem. Improving a global exploration of a combination of floods of bee colony algorithm is mentioned as method\u2019s goals. Moreover, it was applied to two real datasets [5]. The heat transfer optimization algorithm was inspired by both the law of heat transfer and thermodynamics [6]. Another optimization algorithm, inspired by the particle swarm optimization, was recently introduced by Gosciniak et al. Their algorithm was not influenced by the environment, but rather by the particle swarm optimization that was employed as a model of a predator and prey. Moreover, it proved that their approach can be practicable in computer games [7]. The particle swarm optimization is an algorithm in which the first populations were created randomly. It is based on the social interaction among flocks of birds or schools of fish. Zhang et al. enhanced the search ability using the Bayesian techniques through exploiting past particles\u2019 positions and using a new type of mutation in order to obtain better results. Their approach is known as the BPSO method [8]. Gomez et al. introduced new optimization algorithm for spatial variability analysis and showed high improvement in the NDT measurement position [9].",

Binding sites, which indicate chemical specificity and affinity, are either part of a protein or part of DNA or RNA in ligands which form a chemical bond. One of the most important components of the biomolecules\u2019 general characteristics is binding sites that can identify the other proteins. Binding sites also exist in antibodies as coded regions. A non-covalent bond between the two polypeptide chains is formed when a binding site of one protein determines another protein\u2019s surface. Transcriptional factors (TF), are proteins which bind to specific DNA sequences and control the rate of the transcription of genetic information from DNA to RNA. TF are categorized as a sequence of specific DNA binding factors that are of great importance to the regulation of a gene expression. They contain one or more DNA-binding domains that bind to specific sequences of DNA that are contiguous to the genes which they regulate. DNA binding sites are distinguishable from the other algorithms because they include the targets of the other proteins and therefore are part of DNA- in other words, are bound by DNA-binding proteins. DNA binding sites divide into several categories that are as follows: transcriptional factor binding sites, recombination sites, and restriction sites. There is a need for the evolutionary algorithms because the motif discovery problem is an NP (nondeterministic polynomial) hard problem that cannot be solved in polynomial time order. Although these algorithms are not deterministic, they can get acceptable answers in reasonable time order.",

Proposing a genetic algorithm for the motif discovery based on the statistical significance of the current research is another recent study carried out, along with the above-mentioned works. After their proposed algorithm was applied to several different datasets, the obtained motifs were compared with each other [11]. Research into the Bcl-2 family protein is among subjects that relate to the present discussion. The family protein comprises several homologous proteins as well as a collection of other proteins which consists of a sequence of similarities except for a Bcl-2 homology (BH)3 motif. One of the four BH motifs is required for membership in the Bcl-2 family. Abdel et al. evaluated Bcl-2 homology motifs [12]. Determining the cellular binding motif in the case of the acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus is essential because the respiratory syndrome coronavirus threatens human lives [13]. Parkinson, Alzheimer, and some other diseases are a result of aging and stress that are among the major causes of the protean damage. According to Bonham-Carter [14], oxidation of amino acids with a high rate of motifs is due to some protean damages. Most of the solutions for bioinformatics NP_hard problems are based on ACO and PSO [15], [16]. Some of the other related works that we can refer to are as follows:",

            "text": "Although our proposed algorithm (WCC), outlined above, was inspired by human sports rules, most heuristic algorithms have been inspired by nature. The present paper presents a new evolutionary algorithm. The above-mentioned optimization algorithm can be applied to various fields such as economics, computer science, engineering etc., in which the classical algorithms fail to get acceptable answers in reasonable time order. One of the main steps in determining the optimization algorithms\u2019 practical applications is classifying their models into major categories such as continuous optimization versus discrete optimization, unconstrained optimization versus constrained optimization, single-objective optimization versus multi-objective optimization, and deterministic optimization versus stochastic optimization [22]. In discrete optimization, variables often contain a subset of integer values whereas, in continuous optimization, variables contain real values. The proposed algorithm can be used as both discrete and continuous optimization algorithms. While there are some constraints on variables in the constrained category, there are no constraints on variables in the unconstrained category. Such a difference between constrained and unconstrained categories results in the placement of the proposed algorithm (WCC) on an unconstrained category. Most of the optimization algorithms which are known as single-objective optimization algorithms have single-objective functions whereas others which are known as multi-objective optimization algorithms, have multi-objective functions. WCC which is based on the nature of the problem can be applied to either multi-objective or single-objective optimization problems. It is also assumed that WCC is practical for only deterministic optimization problems, in which the nature of problems is invariable, in contrast to stochastic optimization problems with variable natures. The main purpose of this study is to achieve good performance by reducing errors, reach a suitable convergence and appropriate stability, and get an acceptable execution time. A combination of the other optimization algorithms\u2019 dominant properties (such as being competitive in an imperialism competitive algorithm, the penalties and rewards of learning automata, and the evolutionary changes in the genetic algorithms) and the unification of them into the proposed algorithm are the other motivations behind the present paper. Creating teams with random values is the first step forward in the proposed algorithm. A team consists of some players that not only have different roles based on the exact nature of the problem but also play major roles in an algorithm\u2019s good performance. Teams that are put into different groups compete against each other. The highly qualified teams ascend to the elimination stage and continue competing depending on their players\u2019 different tasks. There is a referee who evaluates and scrutinizes teams\u2019 performance. If the end result is not acceptable or termination conditions are not fulfilled, a new season will begin. To carry out the present study, we applied WCC to the transcriptional factor binding sites (TFBS) problem which is categorized as an NP-hard problem, then compared it with several algorithms, including the genetic algorithm (GA), the imperialism competitive algorithm (ICA), the particles swarm optimization (PSO), the ant colony algorithm (ACO), and learning automata (LA) that are categorized as optimization algorithms.",

The differences between WCC and the genetic algorithm are as follows:1.All the chromosomes in the genetic algorithm are put into the current population whereas all the teams in WCC are put into different groups based on hamming distance, maximum likelihood, minimum likelihood, random grouping, and many other methods that are employed based on the exact nature of the problem.2.While there are lots of various operations such as shooting, passing, attacking, kicking and crossing in WCC, there are only two operations in the genetic algorithm, which change the chromosomes that are categorized as crossover and mutation.3.There are two types of competitions among teams in WCC: 1- the local competition and 2- the global competition. By contrast, there is not any competition among chromosomes in the genetic algorithm. The global competition guarantees that WCC does not remain in the local optimal points.4.Only the most deserved chromosomes in the genetic algorithm have a chance to pass down to the next generation whereas all the teams in WCC will get a chance to attend the next season of matches while they are trying to ameliorate their performance.5.In a generation, the genetic operations are applied with a definite rate which is categorized as crossover and mutation rates whereas all of these teams have lots of operations that can be applied in case match termination conditions are fulfilled.6.A team\u05f3s values will be replaced with new values in case the newly earned score is better than the previous one. As we know, in a genetic algorithm, the fitness value for a chromosome is likely to change for the worse after crossover and mutation operations are applied.7.The genetic algorithm was inspired by natural evolution but WCC was inspired by sports rules and roles which are applied to the games.\n",

To carry out the study, WCC, the ant colony optimization algorithm (ACO), PSO, learning automata (LA), GA, and the imperialism competitive algorithm (ICA) are implemented in the MATLAB environment in a system with a 2.2 GH of CPU, 2 GB of RAM and WIN7 (64 bit) operating system, then four datasets are created randomly. We employ four real datasets [24] and present the obtained results in tables and diagrams. A web site is also available, \u201clbbwcc.ir\u201d. You can find some information about implemented algorithms and applied datasets on the web. The above-mentioned algorithms run 100 times for each dataset with a different size of the motif length. The best, the worst, and the average score values, the elapsed time (based on second), the score values standard deviation, and the elapsed time standard deviation (based on second) are determined. The standard deviation (SD) that is commonly used for algorithms\u2019 confidence, is a criterion that shows how much data scattered around the mean. The fewer SD is, the more reliable algorithms are.

The figures are shown in Table 4, Table 5 indicate that dataset1 size is 10\u00d7100, dataset2 size is 20\u00d7200, dataset3 size is 30\u00d7300, and dataset4 size is 40\u00d7400. According to figures, all the real datasets are the same size (in a size 40\u00d760). As we mentioned earlier, the conditions for all algorithms are so similar that they are compared to the same terms and conditions. The end of the predefined numbers of iterations or seasons will bring an end to the algorithms.",

Fig. 8 shows the average stability of algorithms for all randomly created and all real datasets by implementing over 100 times of individual execution. Algorithms\u2019 stability which indicates a fluctuation in the current outcome compared with the previous and subsequent outcomes, is one of the main criteria for a comparison between meta-heuristic algorithms. From this point of view, an algorithm whose results are in a straight forward line with maximum fitness values and a minimum undulation is considered as a proper algorithm [25]. The error bars which indicate the validity of the algorithms are represented in Fig. 8. The above-mentioned criterion determines how similar or different measurements are. The error bars with a minimum height show the suitability of an algorithm as the benchmark that can be used in scientific papers with experimental results shown on graphs [26].",

            "text": "In the current study, a new evolutionary algorithm, known as WCC, which was inspired by human sports rules was introduced. As we know, there are lots of interesting events such as competitions, award ceremonies, victory parties and so many others in sports. Every team has a set of rules and some players who are put into different groups; every player performs a different task. Different teams compete against each other and qualified ones ascend to the next stage and continue their competition. At the end of a season, a champion is introduced and the other teams prepare for a new season. We evaluated the performance of the proposed algorithm on a motif discovery problem and eight benchmark functions. Moreover, we compared WCC with GA, ICA, PSO, ACO and LA, based on the above-mentioned problems. The experimental and numerical results indicated that the proposed algorithm\u05f3s performance was better than the other algorithms\u2019 performance. The proposed algorithm had reasonable execution time, acceptable precision, and more satisfactory results in comparison to the other algorithms. According to our results, WCC was better than the others and from the perspective of the elapsed time standard deviation, it was better than all the other algorithms. The WCC\u05f3s elapsed time was a little longer than the others\u2019, except GA, however if we consider the WCC\u2019s elapsed time a termination condition for the other algorithms, its obtained results will be better than those of the others, too. The ICA\u05f3s results standard deviation was the best in comparison to the others\u2019, but as we observed earlier, its best result was worse than the ACO\u2019s and WCC\u2019s. The WCC\u2019s obtained results standard deviation was also better than the ACO\u05f3s. A trade discovery between WCC parameters that are as follows: playing chances, the number of groups, the number of teams and the number of seasons is an important topic for future research or combining WCC with the other meta-heuristic algorithms and applying it to different optimization problems can be considered an interesting topic for research.",
