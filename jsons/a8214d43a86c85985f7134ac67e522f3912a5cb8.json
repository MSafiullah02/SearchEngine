Methods A total of 52 patients with COVID-19 who were admitted to three hospitals in China from January 23, 2020 to February 1, 2020 were retrospectively analyzed using QCT. The accuracy of QCT segmentation was assessed. The relationship between the time from symptom onset to initial CT and QCT parameters acquired on the initial CT were explored. Results First, the ability of QCT to detect and segment lesions was investigated and it was unveiled that results of segmentation of the majority of cases (42/52) were satisfactory and for 8 out of 52 patients, the images depicted lesions with miss-segmentation; besides, 2 out of 52 cases had negative finding on chest CT achieved by both radiologists and QCT. QCT-related parameters showed to have a relationship with the time from symptom onset to initial CT. In the early-stage (0-3 days), the percentage of lung involvement was 4%, with a mean density of \u2212 462 \u00b1 99 HU. The peak density of lesions appeared at the range of \u2212 500 to \u2212 700 HU on density histogram. In the intermediate-stage (4-6 days), the mean percentage of lung involvement noticeably increased compared with that in early stage (7%, p < 0.05). In late stage (7-14 days), the percentage of lung involvement decreased to 5%. The mean density of lesions was the highest (\u2212 430 \u00b1 80), and heterogeneity density distribution showed a dual-peak on density histogram.",

The steps of segmentation were briefly undertaken as follows: (1) segmentation of the whole lung: a wellestablished thresholding operation was used to extract the lung volume. The threshold is determined based on intensity histogram analysis of the CT images; (2) segmentation of abnormal opacity: it was conducted by means of a 3D region-growing algorithm and a histogram-based thresholding technique; (3) bronchus and pulmonary vessels were segmented: a differential geometric approach was applied to automatically segment the vascular tree and airway tree. A \"puzzle game\" procedure acting as a \"correction\" operation for filtering false identifications was utilized; (4) quantitative evaluation of lesion's volume was conducted after segmentation. The quantitative parameters included the lung volume (LV), total lesion volume (TLV), and percentage of abnormal opacity volume (lesion%). The pixels in abnormal opacity were processed with histogram analysis including an illustration of pixel attenuation (CT numbers). Histogram analysis also allowed measurements of mean density (MD) and the proportion of pixels related to ground-glass opacity (GGO). The details of the algorithm used in the software have been reported in previous studies ([ [12] [13] [14] [15] ; see Fig. 1 ).",

In the analysis of all 52 images, the results of segmentation for the majority of cases (42/52) were satisfactory, and for 8 out of 52 patients, the images depicted lesions with miss-segmentation. After manual segmentation, we calculated the mean volume of missed lesions. The average volume (%) of missed lesions in the lung was 0.01%. Compared with the percentage of lung involvement, the impact of miss-segmentation was insignificant. Lesions with miss-segmentation were observed in the following situations: (1) the lesions were adjacent to the blood vessels, and the vessels were wrongly as lesions; (2) the lesions were adjacent to the heart, and the heart beat artifacts affected the segmentation of the lesions; (3) the lesions were extremely small for segmentation (Fig. 3) .",
