However, they are helpful in the appropriate clinical setting. Findings by CT may be categorized into two main categories by time from onset of symptoms: Early (<7 days from symptoms onset) or advanced (8\u201014 days from symptoms onset). The advanced stage may then progress to either \u201chealing\u201d or that of deterioration with cytokine storm and adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).\n1\n\n",

The GGOs will continue to progress to consolidation bilaterally (Figures 7, 8, 9). As mentioned previously, although a pleural effusion is not usually described as associated with COVID\u201019, one may be noted on occasion (Figure 10).",
