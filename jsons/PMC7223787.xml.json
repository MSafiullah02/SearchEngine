            "text": "Neonatal mortality is defined as death in the first 28 days of life [1]. Roughly two-thirds of all infant deaths before the age of one occur during this neonatal period [2]; in 2017, the Centers for Disease Control reported a neonatal mortality rate of 3.85 per 1000 live births in the United States [1]. Many of these deaths, which can be attributed to a multitude of factors, including prematurity, congenital malformations, and genetic conditions [3], occur in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Numerous studies have explored the emotional and psychological trauma for families who spend time in the NICU [4\u20136]. It is not uncommon for parents of hospitalized NICU infants to experience post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) [7], and grief is further exacerbated when a child dies in this setting. A study from the University of Michigan focusing on perinatal loss up to 28 days found that 9 months after loss, women showed \u201cremarkably high and persistent levels of distress\u201d consistent with severe depression and PTSD [8].",

In fact, QOL can refer to two distinct, if overlapping, entities. One is a broad conception of what QOL means, while the other is health-related QOL, which is more often referenced in the medical literature. The medical field has been trying to measure QOL for decades. A 1996 landmark study in the New England Journal of Medicine conceptualized QOL in terms of multidimensional domains, including social, physical, and psychological, as understood through individual experiences, perceptions, and beliefs [13]. Assessment tools specific to pediatric medicine came later, most notably with the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL), which has been validated as a means of reliably quantifying health-related QOL outcomes for children with chronic health conditions [14\u201316]. More recently, the PedsQL Infant Scales were developed, which have also been found to be a valid and reliable means of assessing healthy and ill infants aged 1\u201312 and 13\u201324 months [17, 18]. However, even the PedsQL Infant Scales deal only with current health status and expected newborn milestones, as opposed to conceptions of QOL that include long-term medical, psychological, and social/emotional sequelae, or prognostic outcomes based on diagnoses made during the neonatal period.",

This is especially important when considering how \u201cQOL\u201d as an idea is utilized in discussions between physicians and families when determining the best course of treatment for critically ill infants, including those transitioning to comfort or palliative care [19, 20]. Some within the field contend that the fluidity of the term QOL as it is currently employed is beneficial, allowing physicians to evaluate each patient and make informed decisions on a case-by-case basis without the rigidity of guidelines that may stifle their clinical judgment. However, there are others who argue in favor of a more uniform palliative care transition process for neonates, which includes discussions of QOL. Proponents of standardization assert that set policies around these ideas would help to ensure a minimum level of care for all families, facilitating consistency, and supporting providers through what is often a very difficult clinical encounter [21].",

The cornerstone of FCC in the NICU is the belief that families should actively participate in the determination of their child\u2019s care, thereby facilitating physician and parent collaboration [25]. As this is the philosophy in most NICUs today, both parent and physician perspectives must be explored in order to thoroughly examine interpretations of QOL and its utility as a clinical metric.",

            "text": "With this in mind, we can better contextualize the significance of data collected. The findings reported here indicate several key differences between how families and physicians evaluate QOL in the NICU setting, when focusing on the specific disabilities analyzed. One example of these differences is the perception of medical intervention. Families were more likely than physicians to associate the need for a ventilator, need for a tracheostomy, and need for future surgery with a \u201cbad\u201d QOL, while physicians were more likely than parents to allow the definition of a \u201cgood QOL\u201d to include need for future surgery and need for a tracheostomy. Parents also expressed concern regarding the NICU environment itself, identifying the setting as \u201cstressful,\u201d and referencing the continuous \u201cpoking and prodding\u201d as a perceived threat to the patients\u2019 ability to develop naturally. Physicians, however, did not raise this concern. This incongruity between parent and staff perceptions of infant discomfort due to medical intervention was likewise identified in a 2004 study in California by Gale et al. They found that NICU parents felt as though the team often minimized their child\u2019s pain when enduring routine procedures, and expressed a desire for the staff to see and respond to the infants\u2019 pain as a parent would [26]. Similar studies, including a 1997 paper by Wereszczak et al., also observed parental distress by the perceived pain that infants sustained during standard clinical practice in the NICU [27, 28]. This discrepancy in perception between parents and physicians can most likely be attributed to familiarity and understanding. While parents may see one child with a tracheostomy, neonatologists will treat many over the course of their careers, particularly in high-acuity centers [29]. Furthermore, years of clinical practice allow physicians to better understand the utility of these technologies in patient care than parents. As one physician in the focus group said, \u201cWe do things to babies that are uncomfortable, painful, stressful, and it\u2019s acceptable to make those interventions to cause that pain and discomfort because it serves a purpose of survival\u201d.",

            "text": "Another key divergence was found in the interpretations of long-term health outcomes. In general, physicians were more concerned than families with enduring physical, mental, and cognitive impairment of children. For example, thirty-four parents expressed in their written comments a belief that no combination of the listed disabilities constituted a bad QOL for a child, while no physicians expressed this view. There are multiple ways to interpret this finding. First, as Steinhauser et al. demonstrated, it may reflect a difference in prioritization of QOL factors between physicians and patients/parents [30]. This difference may stem from what some activists and bioethicists refer to as \u201cmedical ableism,\u201d or the \u201cassumption that the \u2018normal\u2019 able body is better than abnormal bodily forms\u201d [31]. According to some, medicine as a profession has historically underestimated and undervalued the QOL of persons with disabilities [32]. Many studies have shown that what physicians perceive to be detrimental to QOL, patients with disabilities do not [33, 34]. In the setting of the NICU, our study shows that parents likewise believe that extensive disabilities do not preclude a good QOL for babies, reflecting positive parental associations with raising a disabled child, as numerous studies have shown [35\u201337]. As one respondent wrote in the additional feedback portion of the survey, \u201cNone of these are reasons to think your child would have a bad QOL. Challenges? Sure\u2014but they could still have a happy life\u201d.",

            "text": "Another possibility may be a lack of experience on the part of parents when compared to the training and expertise of physicians. As many in the focus groups mentioned, parents in the NICU are often encountering these situations for the first time. Most have no formal education in the science underlying the care of infants, and the intense nature and sheer stress of the NICU setting may further prevent families from being able to rationalize the challenges ahead [4, 38, 39]. Neonatologists, on the other hand, will have treated similar patients and seen the various sequelae of similar diagnoses, and thus view outcomes from a more data-driven, rational perspective. As one physician in the focus group said, \u201cOftentimes you know when something will not turn out well for the family. Many of us have been doing this for a long time and these are conversations we are very comfortable and well-versed in\u201d. However, it is important to note that exposure to and practice treating medically complex patients in the NICU does not equate to the experience parents have raising these children at home. In total, 41% of the participants in our family survey were identified as caretakers of children with medical problems, and although they may not have the same knowledge base to understand the ramifications of certain diagnoses as their child\u2019s physician, they do have a different kind of knowledge about what a patient\u2019s life looks like after they leave the hospital. Furthermore, clinical decision-making is an imperfect science. A study by Blanco et al. [40] found that the medical profession routinely underestimates survival rates and overestimates long-term disability rates for premature infants, particularly at less than 28 and 26 weeks of gestation [40]. Therefore, while neonatologists\u2019 level of training may allow them to guide a family to see their infant beyond a snapshot in time, it may not always be true that a QOL projection made by a neonatologist based on prognostic indicators is inherently more accurate than that patient\u2019s family.",

As both groups mentioned, it is extremely difficult to have a conversation about transitioning an infant to comfort care, especially when that child is your own. In the focus groups, several participants expressed a willingness and even desperation to go home with their baby alive, even if that meant adjusting to \u201ca new normal\u201d, namely disability or morbidity. This becomes especially true for families who spend long periods of time in the NICU. As one mother said, \u201cYour perception of QOL changes with each day in the hospital. After a while you just want to get started on your life\u2014you don\u2019t care what it looks like\u201d. The emotional bond parents feel, as well as perceived parental responsibility to protect, may cloud their ability to rationally weigh difficult decisions. One study addressed the concept of \u201cgood parenting\u201d for sick children, and noted that many parents believed that asking for more treatment or more time, whatever the cost, is synonymous with being a better parent [41]. Although physicians often feel deep connections with patients and their families, the relationship with a patient is based on a different set of goals. As one doctor said, \u201cWe are primarily driven by what\u2019s in the best interest of the baby. Often the family may not be there yet\u2014still resisting the inevitable. We are there to help them educate themselves, use the information available to make a decision that limits pain and suffering whenever possible\u201d.",

Both groups found similar value in QOL as a metric to consider when determining whether to continue life-sustaining therapies for infants. This foundational, shared belief is important because it demonstrates the relevance of this discourse and related research. Members of both groups also referenced uncontrollable pain as a barrier to QOL that warranted transitions to palliative or comfort care. Another similarity was found in discussions of connection and communication with loved ones as a measure for QOL. Both groups referenced the concept frequently in the free response section of the survey, and \u201cinability to interact with others\u201d was ranked low at 18 and 19 out of 20 by parents and physicians respectively as being compatible with a \u201cgood QOL\u201d. This reflects a universal recognition of the role that community, support, and nurturing play in the health and well-being of NICU patients, with the power of relationships as a defining feature for QOL.",

Some experts believe that there is utility in standardizing the way physicians talk about the care of NICU patients in the context of QOL and palliative care transition [42, 43]. Other researchers have acknowledged the role that systemic protocols play in the preservation of distributive justice, referring to a need to strategically allocate resources and therefore choose not to provide futile treatments to those babies for whom there is little chance of survival [44]. However, the trouble as our data demonstrate, is the immense variability in interpretation and valuation of QOL both within and among relevant parties. As one physician in our focus group said, \u201cIs QOL ever so bad that it is worse than non-survival? That gets into philosophical, religious, and other realms where reasonable people can disagree\u201d. Perhaps then, as this study suggests, QOL is unlike ventilatory settings or blood pressure values, and cannot be reliably defined or standardized for use in a clinical context. Since the term QOL bears so many connotations, signifying different concepts depending on one\u2019s role and perspective, it cannot be used in a meaningful way among a team of individuals trying to determine the course of treatment for an infant. Therefore, despite its prevalence in NICU discourse, we conclude that the common practice surrounding how infant QOL is discussed is problematic, and that neonatologists should use QOL judiciously when communicating with families regarding care, knowing that it does not in fact have a validated definition acknowledged by the medical or parent communities.",

Longevity, and the projected number of years lived, has historically been a metric used by the medical field when determining prognosis and treatment course. The NICU is no different. There has been some research that incorporates both issues, using NICU graduates who have survived to adolescence and adulthood to assess health-related QOL scores. In one such study, children with former diagnoses of extreme prematurity and very low birth weight reported a lower health-related QOL than their term-born counterparts, with significant difficulties in economic and social function despite survival to early adulthood [45]. Another study, however, conducted with a similar patient population, found that health-related QOL for those who survived to young adulthood was not related to size at birth or the presence of disability [46]. More research is needed to understand the intersection of total life years and experienced QOL, both from the patient and family perspectives.",

This lack of diversity, despite a targeted recruitment process, limits the generalizability of the findings. Unfortunately, these pitfalls are common to survey and parent-based research in the neonatal population. For one, pediatric research has historically struggled to include the perspective of fathers [47]. One 2005 study focusing on paternal representation in parenting and child psychology research found that only 2.3% of studies in health-related journals included the assessment of fathers only, compared with 46.7% focusing on mothers only [48]. This challenge is pervasive across other pediatric disciplines as well [49]. Achieving racial diversity in research recruitment and participation has historically been problematic as well [50, 51]. Similarly, structured studies focused on the neonatal population have encountered these issues (Shelkowitz et al. [52], Cacciatore et al. [53]), indicating a larger need for the concentrated exploration of narratives belonging to parents and families who identify with underrepresented racial and ethnic groups.",
