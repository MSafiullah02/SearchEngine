            "text": "The distal oberhautchen and proximal beta layer of 41 species and every genus of cordylid and gerrhosaurid lizard were examined with a scanning electron microscope. Scale organs in these families are concentrated on the face, and scale organs occur singly or in pairs below the keel on the dorsals of cordylids but not gerrhosaurids. Most species examined possess primitive, lenticular scale organs. Unique and previously unknown, projecting scale organs occur in two species of Cordylus. Scale organs appear to be absent in species of Chamaesaura. The scale surfaces of cordylids are covered in macrohoneycomb. Individual compartments of cordylid macrohoneycomb are not intracellular structures but may be overlain by apparent oberhautchen cells. In some cordylid species, part of each cell is free and projects away from the scale surface as a pointed flap. Gerrhosaurids lack macrohoneycomb. Instead, their scale surfaces are covered in lamellae without dentate borders, 50-100 times as long as wide. The epidermis of Platysaurus is unique among cordylids in possessing lamellae 1-8 times as wide as long that overlap macrohoneycomb in some regions of the body. The scale surfaces of Cordylus cordylus undergo an ontogenetic change similar to that recently described for the xenosaurid genus Shinisaurus. Phylogenetic analysis of scale surface features allows the partitioning of Cordylus into three species groups and Charnaesaura into two species groups. Synapomorphies of the species of Chamaesaura, the species of Platysaurus, and the genera of the gerrhosaurids are also described. o",

Only recently, with the advent of scanning electron microscopy has the impressive amount of variation in these features and their promising utility (Williams, '89) in systematics been realized. Characteristics of the epidermis provide valuable phylogenetic information because they are often relatively conservative at high taxonomic levels (Harvey, '93j. At least some epidermal features, such as microornamentation patterns, reflect phylogenetic relationships rather than ecological specializations (Price, '81, '82) . The scale surfaces of representative species from most lizard families have been described, although many families, such as the Cordylidae and Gerrhosauridae, remain poorly known.",

The relative thickness of these layers and the degree to which they invest topographic features on the surface varies among taxa and is phylogenetically informative. Using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and recently described techniques (Irish et al., '88; Harvey, '931 , these deeper epidermal layers can be studied at the same time as surface features. The simultaneous study of several epidermal layers is more likely to result in the correct identification of homologous characters. New data (Harvey, '93) derived from examination of the medial surface of the p-keratin layer and distal a-keratin layer demonstrate that macrohoneycomb and lamellae are not homologous structures and should not be treated as alternative states for a single character in phylogenetic analysis. At least four tissue layers comprise the ridges of macrohoneycomb, and lamellae overlap these structures on the scale surfaces of some scleroglossans.",

Herein the distribution and morphology of different types of scale organs and epidermal microornamentation are described for representative species of gerrhosaurids and cordylids. Additionally, we describe the ontogeny of scale surfaces in one species of Cordylus and determine if deeper epidermal layers of cordylid macrohoneycomb and juvenile epidermal morphology are like those observed in xenosaurids (Harvey, '93) . Characteristics of the epidermis of cordylids and gerrhosaurids are discussed in a phylogenetic framework. Finally, for species of Cordylus we identify three character states that may help resolve systematic problems among this speciose radiation of poorly known lizards.",

            "text": "In addition to flaps and the elongate cells of Platysaurus, three other modifications of the cell-ridge system were observed in some cordylid lineages. In each of the three species of Chamaesaura, the chambers are oval rather than diamond shaped and deeply indented by a near-circular pit 7-15 pm in diameter. Several species of Cordylus possess short ridge-like projections (Figs. 6E, 8) [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] p,m long and the same height as the surround-ing ridges but not as high as the flap-like margins. They are located in the center of some of the macrohoneycomb chambers and show no consistent orientation to the long or short axis of the cell or any axis of the scale or body. Like similar, though taller (up to 13 pm) and more regular \"tubercles\" observed in the centers of cells in Lepidophyma species (Peterson and Bezy, '85) , these projections typically are curved with a convex and a concave side. Unlike the tubercles of Lepidophyma, approximately 20% are tripartite (Fig.  8) . Central ridge-like projections were observed only among species possessing flaps.",

The tubercles grade into flaps that become progressively elevated nearer the scale margins (Fig. 1OD-F) . The flaps are considerably thicker, have a more irregular shape, and are considerably more prominent in embryos and juveniles than in adults. As in the adult, apparent cell margins lie atop ridges (Fig. 10D,E) of the underlying macrohoneycomb.

Examination of outgroups shows that, in each case, ancestral scale organs were lenticular, resembling the scale organs illustrated for Gerrhosaurus major (Fig. 2) . Bristled scale organs probably evolved through modifications of existing hair-like structures, or spinules, that cover the epidermis in gekkotans and many iguanians (Schmidt, '20; Joger, '84) . No evidence suggests that such protoadaptive structures were present in the ancestors of either Shinisaurus or Cordylus. In these species, a projecting structure most likely formed through the distal attenuation of an ancestral lenticular scale organ. The resulting scale organs lack any remnant of a lenticular base, but project directly from the scale surface or just medial to a narrow, encircling furrow. The scale organs of Shinisaurus were further modified through the thickening of the @ and oberhautchen to form a rigid spike resembling scale organs shown to function like a lever arm in Calotes (Hiller, 1978) . In Cordylus, the beta and oberhautchen of the facial scale organs remained thin, and the organs were modified through the lateral expansion of the a layer into the adjacent @ layer.",

Tactile scale organs: (0) present; (1) absent. This character is a synapomorphy of Chamaesaura. All other gerrhosaurids and cordylids primitively possess scale organs. 4. Scale organs on scales of the body (Fig. 4E, Fj: (0) present; (1) absent. This character may be a synapomorphy of the Gerrhosauridae.

Justification for recognizing three groups within Cordylus and two groups within Chamaesaura was also demonstrated: Macrohoneycomb covers the ventral scales ofboth Chamaesaura anguina and C. macrolepis thus uniting these two taxa in a C. anguina group. No phylogenetic hypothesis of Cordylus exists. All the members of a C. niger group share a central ridge-like projection positioned within their oberhautchen cells. Two additional groups may be paraphyletic: the C. cordylus group which possesses flaps but no central ridges and the C. giganteus group which lacks both characters. The presence of frayed flaps in C. polyzonus may further partition the genus. The species is left in the C. niger group because, for some species, interparietals were unavailable for inspecting the condition of the flaps. When interparietals of the other species become available, recognition of a fourth group containing C. polyzonus may be justified. Cordylus cataphractus and C. cordylus share derived scale organs. As this study did not ascertain the condition of the scale organs for most cordylids, the level at which this character is informative is not yet apparent.",

The flaps of immature C. cordylus, like those of the adult, are composed solely of beta keratin, while in Shinisaurus the flaps are composed of layers of a-and p-keratin. Furthermore, the exaggerated flaps of C. cordylus are probably free oberhautchen cell margins, while the flaps of Shinisaurus clearly are not intracellular structures of the oberhautchen.
