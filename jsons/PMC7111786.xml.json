            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), caused by SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), is a life-threatening emerging infectious disease originated from Guangdong Province, China (Poutanen et al., 2003, Tsang et al., 2003). SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), a distant member of Group 2 coronaviruses, has recently been identified as the etiological agent of SARS (Drosten et al., 2003, Ksiazek et al., 2003, Marra et al., 2003, Rota et al., 2003). The genome of SARS-CoV is about 29.7 kb with the characteristic gene order [5\u2032-replicase (rep), Spike (S), Envelope (E), Membrane (M), Nucleocapsid (N)-3\u2032]. Besides the four structural proteins, it also contains six open reading frames (ORFs) located between S and E, and M and N genes. The proteins encoded by these ORFs, referred as subgroup-specific ORFs of SARS-CoV show no significant homologies to any previously known proteins (Marra et al., 2003, Rota et al., 2003). Previous studies suggest that coronavirus accessory proteins, varying in size and position in the genome of coronaviruses, may be dispensable for virus replication, at least in the cell culture system, and important for virus\u2013host interaction. For example, mutation or deletion of one of these proteins, such as ORF7b of feline coronavirus and ORF3 of swine enteric and respiratory coronavirus is related to their reduced virulence and pathogenesis (Herrewegh et al., 1995, Paul et al., 1997).",

It was reported that 7a protein was located at ER and ER-Golgi intermembrane compartment and interacted with SARS-CoV ORF3a protein in the SARS-CoV infected Vero E6 cells (Fielding et al., 2004, Nelson et al., 2005, Tan et al., 2004b). Recent data showed that overexpression of 7a protein could induce apoptosis via a caspase-dependent pathway in the transfected cell lines derived from different organs (Tan et al., 2004a). In this article, we first presented the evidence that overexpression of 7a could inhibit cell growth and block cell cycle procession at G0/G1 phase via cyclin D3/Rb pathway, and the domain responsible for these functions was identified through mutation analysis. These results suggest that 7a may play important roles in life cycle of SARS-CoV and the pathogenesis induced by SARS-CoV.",

Western blotting assay with anti-myc antibody demonstrated the expression of myc-7a protein in the transfected cells, which migrated at the expected molecular mass of approximately 19.5 kDa. In GFP-7a expressed cells, the expected band at 48.5 kDa was detected with anti-GFP antibody. However, two bands of \u223c48.5 kDa and 46 kDa were observed in 7a-GFP transfected cells (Fig. 1A). Published data showed that about 50% of the precursor form of 7a (\u223c 17.5 kDa) was cleaved from the signal peptide at the N terminus, yielding a product of \u223c15 kDa protein in SARS-CoV infected Vero E6 cells (Fielding et al., 2004). The reason for only emergence of unprocessed forms of myc-7a and GFP-7a may be that the tag at N terminus of 7a affects the cleavage of the signal peptide.",

            "text": "We have observed that HEK 293 cells transfected with 7a/pCMV-myc grow slower than pCMV-myc transfected cells. We thus speculated that expression of 7a protein may inhibit cell proliferation. The numbers of both pCMV-myc and 7a/pCMV-myc transfected HEK 293 cells, as quantitated with trypan blue dye exclusion assay, increased significantly from 0 to 24 h post-transfection. But from 24 to 48 h post-transfection, the myc-7a expressed cells grew much slower than the cells expressing myc only, but no 7a protein (P < 0.05) (Fig. 1B). Similar growth inhibition of 7a/pEGFP-N1 transfected cells was observed when compared with pEGFP-N1 transfected cells (P < 0.05). These results indicate that expression of 7a is associated with inhibition of cell growth. The above experiments were repeated with MTT assay, a more sensitive colorimetric test to monitor the cell proliferation. As shown in Fig. 1C, the growth inhibition of 7a/pCMV-myc transfected HEK 293 cells was significantly dependent on the dose of plasmid used for transfection, whereas the growth of 7a/pCMV-myc transfected HEK 293 cells was marginally inhibited at the highest dose of plasmid (1.25 \u03bcg/ml). Flow cytometric analysis revealed that the transfection efficiencies of 7a/pCMV-myc were significantly raised from 10% to 45% with the increase of plasmid doses from 0.25 to 1.25 \u03bcg/ml. Similar results were obtained in 7a/pEGFP-N1 and pEGFP-N1 transfected HEK 293 cells (data not shown). These data further suggest that the cell growth inhibition level is correlated with the amounts of 7a expressed in the transfected cells. To address the mechanism of 7a on cell growth inhibition, cell DNA synthesis was further measured by 5-Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) incorporation. As shown in Fig. 1D, about 75% of 7a-GFP negative cells had BrdUrd incorporation, while most 7a-GFP positive cells partly or completely lacked BrdUrd incorporation in 7a/pEGFP-N1 transfected COS-7 and Vero cells. As a control, both pEGFP-N1 positive and negative cells had similar rates of BrdUrd incorporation. These data indicate that 7a expression inhibits cells growth and prevented cell cycle entry into S phase.",

            "text": "Cell cycle dysregulation is a common response of host cells to many virus infections. Cell cycle arrest can be efficiently induced by some viral proteins such as Vpr of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), ORF-a of feline immunodeficiency virus and p28 of murine hepatitis coronavirus (MHV) (Chen et al., 2004, Gemeniano et al., 2004, He et al., 1995). Flow cytometry is a rapid, quantitative, multiparameter analysis of cells based on the measurement of visible and fluorescent light emission. Using myc-tag as an indicator of the positively transfected cells (Deng et al., 2004), cell cycle profile of two intercultural populations was analyzed by flow cytometry in 7a/pCMV-myc transfected HEK 293 cells. The transfection efficiency of 7a/pCMV-myc in HEK293 cells was revealed to be 36.6% by flow cytometry. As shown in Fig. 2A, about 87% of 7a positive cells were in G0/G1 phase and only \u223c35% of negative cells were in G0/G1 phase at 24 h post-transfection (P < 0.01). As a control, wild-type and pCMV-myc transfected HEK 293 cells had similar cell cycle profiles with about 50% of cells in G0/G1 phase. To reveal the functional integrity of 7a protein, the above experiments were repeated with 7a fused with GFP tag at its C or N terminus. The transfection efficiencies of pEGFP-N1, 7a/pEGFP-N1 and 7a/pEGFP-C1 in HEK293 cells were about 20%, 30.0% and 29.0%, respectively. As expected, the pEGFP-N1 transfected cells showed similar cell cycle profiles between GFP positive and negative cells, but the percentage of G0/G1 phase in 7a/pEGFP-N1 positive cells (83%) was greater than that in the negative ones (29%), suggesting that 7a expression could block cell cycle progression at G0/G1 phase (P < 0.01). While in 7a/pEGFP-C1 transfected cells, the blockage of G0/G1 phase was also observed, but was less significant than that in 7a/pEGFP-N1 transfected cells, suggesting that GFP fusion at the N terminus of 7a may partly impact its function. To observe whether the G0/G1 phase arrest induced by 7a expression was cell line-specific or not, pCMV-myc and 7a/pCMV-myc were separately transfected into COS-7 and Vero cells. COS-7 was another higher transfection efficiency cell line that derived from African green monkey kidney. Vero cells, derived from African green monkey kidney fibroblast-like, were susceptible to SARS-CoV infection. Like HEK 293 cells, transfection with pCMV-myc had little effects on cell cycle profiles of COS-7 and Vero cells (data not shown). In both cells, G0/G1 phase arrests induced by 7a expression were observed which was as obvious as that in HEK 293 cells, indicating that some common proteins in different cell lines were involved in the G0/G1 phase arrest induced by 7a expression (Fig. 2B). Similar results were observed in 7a/pEGFP-N1 transfected COS-7 and Vero cells (data not shown).",

Cells in G0/G1 phase arrest might go into apoptosis, or recover from the G0/G1 phase and entering into S phase (Chen et al., 2004, Deng et al., 2004). To observe the denouement of the G0/G1 phase arrest induced by 7a protein, cell cycle analysis was performed in 7a/pCMV-myc transfected HEK 293 cells from 24 to 60 h after transfection. It was shown that increases in G0/G1 phase and decreases in S phase in myc-7a expressed cells were obvious throughout all times, and more significant at 24 h post-transfection (P < 0.01). With the increases in S phase at the late time points, the percentage of G0/G1 phase became decreased in myc-7a expressed cells. Sub-G1 phases, representing one type of cell apoptosis, were observed at late time points, but not over 10% of analyzed cells. Interestingly, there was no significant difference in sub-G1 phase between myc-7a positive and negative cells (Fig. 2C). Redistribution of phosphatidylserine is an early and common phenomenon in the process of cell apoptosis, which can be stained by Annexin V. HEK 293 cells were harvested at 24 h, 36 h and 48 h after transfection with pCMV-myc and 7a/pCMV-myc, and apoptosis was measured by using Annexin V staining. The transfection efficiency of 7a/pCMV-myc in HEK293 cells was revealed to be about 40% by flow cytometry. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis indicated that the rates of apoptosis at 24 h, 36 h and 48 h post-transfection were 9.4%, 8.5% and 10.0% in 7a/pCMV-myc transfected cells and 3.8%, 3.4% and 3.0% in pCMV-myc transfected cells (Fig. 2D). It was reported that overexpression of ORF7a could induce apoptosis via a caspase-dependent pathway (Tan et al., 2004a). However, the data from our results support the opinion that 7a protein may be much more a cell cycle arrest inductor than an apoptosis inductor.",

To define the functional domain of 7a protein for inducing cell cycle arrest, a series of truncated mutants from C-terminus of 7a were constructed based on the bioinformation obtained from the bioinformation analysis to avoid major disruption of protein folding (Fig. 3A). The genes for encoding the 7a mutants, D118\u2013122, D102\u2013122, D83\u2013122 and D44\u2013122 with deletion of the KRKTE ER retrieval signal, the transmembrane region, the proximal membrane region and the middle domain of 7a, respectively, were cloned into pCMV-myc vector separately. These truncated 7a proteins expressed in the transfected cells showed the expected molecular mass in Western blotting assays (data not shown). The subcellular localization of these deleting constructs was performed in HEK 293 cells. As shown in Fig. 3B, wild-type 7a was observed to distribute in the cytoplasm and plasma membrane in a punctulate pattern with condensing into discrete loci and spot fluorescence. The mutants D118\u2013122, D102\u2013122 and D83\u2013122 had similar fluorescent distribution as wild-type 7a protein; however, D44\u2013122 displayed a more smear fluorescence in cytoplasm and nucleus, indicating that the domain spanning aa 44\u201382 was needed for 7a cytoplasm localization.",

            "text": "One key regulator of cell cycle progression from the G0/G1 phase to the S phase is Rb, which binds to and represses the transcription factor E2F. The hyperphosphorylation of Rb by some cyclin/cdk complexes allows the release and activation of E2F, permitting the transcription of S phase genes. It was reported that phosphorylation of Rb on Ser-795 is important for its binding to E2F and phosphorylation of Rb on Ser-807/811 is needed to bind the ubiquitously expressed c-Abl tyrosine kinase (Dimberg et al., 2003). To understand the mechanism of 7a-induced G0/G1 cell cycle arrest, we first examined the phosphorylation status of Rb in transfected cells by Western blotting analysis. The total HEK 293 cells transfected with pCMV-myc, 7a/pCMV-myc, pEGFP-N1 and 7a/pEGFP-N1 plasmids were collected at 24 h post-transfection and analyzed with phosphor-specific anti-Rb antibodies on Ser-795 or Ser-807/811. As shown in Fig. 4A, GFP, 7a-GFP and myc-7a were expressed at the expected molecular mass and Rb phosphorylation on Ser-795 and Ser-807/811 was down-regulated in 7a-GFP and myc-7a expressed cells. It was indicated that the expression of 7a, rather than myc or GFP, inhibits Rb phosphorylation and blocks cell cycle progression at G0/G1 phase. The phosphorylation status of Rb was further studied in 7a/pCMV-myc transfected cells (Fig. 4B). Expression of myc-7a was observed at all the time points with the highest level at 24 h post-transfection, whereas the phosphorylation of Rb on ser795 and ser807/811 decreased gradually after transfection. Same density of the actin bands were revealed, suggesting that the varied levels of the expression of 7a and phosphorylation of Rb are not due to the different amounts of total cell lysates loaded. More obvious G0/G1 phase arrest (Fig. 2C) at 24 h post-transfection was coincided with the higher level of 7a expression, but not with the phosphorylation status of Rb, suggesting that multiple pathways may be involved in the regulation of cell cycle.",

            "text": "G1 cyclin/cdk complexes regulate cell cycle progression through the phosphorylation of Rb. pRb is hypo-phosphorylated by cyclin D/cdk4/6 complexes in early G1 phase and hyper-phosphorylated by the cyclin E/cdk2 complex in late G1 phase, followed by a continuous hyper-phosphorylation in the S, G2 and M phases of cycling cells. Chen and Makino (2004) first reported that infection of coronavirus MHV inhibited Rb phosphorylation and induced cell cycle arrest through the reduction of cdk4, cdk6 and G1 cyclins such as D1, D2, D3 and E. Accordingly, the inhibition of Rb phosphorylation in 7a expressed cells suggests that the expression of G1 cyclin/cdk complexes was suppressed. To verify the possibility, we have analyzed the expression levels of cyclin D1, D2, D3 and cdk4, cdk6 in 7a/pCMV-myc and 7a/pEGFP-N1 transfected cells by Western blots. No significant changes were observed in the levels of cdk4 and cdk6 between pCMV-myc and 7a/pCMV-myc, and between pEGFP-N1 and 7a/pEGFP-N1 transfected cells (Fig. 4A). And the expression of cdk4 and cdk6 was not obviously different from 12 to 48 h after transfection with 7a/pCMV-myc (Fig. 4B). In contrast, cyclin D3 was markedly decreased in myc-7a or 7a-GFP expressed cells when compared with control ones. Furthermore, the level of cyclin D3 was significantly decreased from 12 to 48 h after transfection with 7a/pCMV-myc, which was consistent with the changes of Rb phosphorylation. The expression of cyclin D1 and D2 was not observed in HEK 293 transfected with 7a/pCMV-myc, pCMV-myc, 7a/pEGFP-N1 and pEGFP-N1, respectively (data not shown). Using the same antibodies, the expression of cyclin D1 and D2 was observed in NIH/3T3 cells and A549 cells, respectively. So, the reason for not detecting the changes of cyclin D1 and D2 in our tests may be that the amounts of these proteins in HEK 293 cells were too small to detect. In addition, transcription of cyclin D3 mRNA was analyzed by RT-PCR assay. As compared with the control cells, the transcriptional level of cyclin D3 was decreased obviously in 3a/pCMV-myc transfected cells (Fig. 4C). It was indicated that the decrease in the amounts of cyclin D3 induced by ORF7a expression may come from the down-regulation of its mRNA transcription. The activities of G1 cyclin/cdk complexes are regulated by cdk-inhibitors (CKIs), which can be grouped into INK4 family and Cip/Kip family (Sherr and Roberts, 1999). To gain further insight into the nature of the cell cycle arrest induced by 7a protein, the expression levels of p21Cip1 and p27Kip1, two main members of Cip/Kip family, were examined in the 7a/pCMV-myc and 7a/pEGFP-N1 transfected HEK 293 cells by Western blotting. 7a expression had no effect on the amounts of p21 and p27 proteins (data not shown). As a control, the activation of cyclin A/cdc2 complex, which is an important regulatory complex in G2/M phase, was further examined. It was shown that there were no changes in the status of phosphorylated cdc2 as well as expression of cyclin A in 7a transfected cells (data not shown). These results suggest that significant reduction of cyclin D3 induced by 7a expression prevents activity of the cyclin D/cdk4/6 complex in HEK 293 cells, which in turn may cause the inhibition of the phosphorylation of Rb, resulting in blockage of the cell cycle progression in the G0/G1 phase.",

Cyclin D3 is expressed in nearly all of proliferating cells, and it is the most broad expression pattern of the three D-type cyclins. Sicinska et al. (2003) reported that cyclin D3\u2212/\u2212 mice suffered from an isolated defect in thymocyte development characterized by a marked deficit in CD4\n+CD8\n+ double positive T cells. The significant decreases in peripheral CD4\n+ and CD8\n+ T lymphocyte subsets observed in SARS patients are related to the onset of SARS (Huang et al., 2005). The mechanism for this lymphocytopenia induced by SARS-CoV infection is largely unknown. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and CD209L, two potential SARS-CoV receptors, were reported to be expressed in lymph nodes, thymus and Peyer's patches, and proposed to mediate transfer of SARS-CoV to T cells (Jeffers et al., 2004, Li et al., 2003). Therefore, it would be interesting to test whether 7a expression induces growth inhibition or apoptosis of T lymphocytes via the reduction of cyclin D3.",

            "text": "The role of cell cycle arrest induced by 7a was not determined in viral life cycle of SARS-CoV, but proposed from recent relative studies. Infection by coronavirus MHV resulted in inhibition of host cellular DNA synthesis and accumulation of cells in G0/G1 phase in activating DBT and 17Cl-1 cells through inducing cyclin D2 and cyclin E degradation (Chen and Makino, 2004). The expression of non-structural protein p28 of MHV may be responsible for induction of G0/G1 phase arrest and cell cycle arrest (Chen et al., 2004). Increasing data suggest that cell cycle arrest in the G0/G1 phase may favor coronavirus replication and exacerbate virus-induced pathogenicity, especially in some aspects, such as increasing amounts of ribonucleotide pools for efficient coronavirus RNA synthesis, preventing the induction and execution of early cell death in infected cells, assisting in efficient coronavirus assembly, benefiting cap-dependent translation of coronavirus proteins and decreasing the killed efficiency of coronavirus infected cells by cytotoxic T cells (Bonneau and Sonenberg, 1987, Chen and Makino, 2002, Chen and Makino, 2004, Nishioka and Welsh, 1994). The present study has shown that expression of 7a could significantly inhibit cell growth and induce cell G0/G1 phase arrest through cyclin D3/pRb pathway, suggesting that 7a may play an important role in SARS-CoV induced pathogenesis.",

The different mutants of ORF7a were constructed based on bioinformatic analysis of 7a. The box represented the transmembrane domain referred to as membrane, and the black bars at N or C terminus were represented the signal peptide and KRKTE ER retrieval signal motif, respectively. The amino acid positions for ORF7a mutants were given below, the statuses of G0/G1 phase arrest were shown on the right. (B) Cellular localization of 7a truncated mutants. Serial mutants of ORF7a (D118\u2013122, D102\u2013122, D83\u2013122 and D44\u2013122) cloned to pCMV-myc vector were transfected into HEK 293 cells. At 24 h after transfection, the cells on glass slips were fixed and viewed with anti-myc antibody. The nuclear was stained with Hoechst. Cellular localization was observed by scanning fluorescence confocal microscopy. Green (on the left) represented expression of mutant 7a; blue (in the middle) represented Hoechst stained cell nuclei; and images (on the right) represented overlapping green and blue fluorescence. (C) Expression of 7a mutants blocked cell cycle progression at G0/G1 phase. HEK 293 cells were transfected with described constructs of ORF7a separately. At 24 h post-transfection, samples were collected and stained with PI. DNA contents of cells were measured by flow cytometry. Three independent sets of experiments were repeated. (D) Profile of Annexin V staining in ORF7a mutants transfected cells. HEK 293 cells were transfected with ORF7a mutants. At 24 h post-transfection, samples were collected and analyzed by flow cytometry for the ability to bind Annexin V as before.
