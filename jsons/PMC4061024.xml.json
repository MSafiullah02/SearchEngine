It is well recognised that ecological processes influence the spatial distribution and patterns of disease risk and disease incidence [18]. Fundamental spatial risk factors comprise the geographic distribution of the pathogen, the natural host and potential spill-over hosts, overlaid by an environmental complexity of ecological and climatic variables that affect the behaviour of the above. The ability of climatic variables to influence host-pathogen interactions and spatial patterns of disease was highlighted in Australia recently with the identification of the role of relative humidity, maximum air temperature and wind speed in the spread of introduced equine influenza virus [19].",

McFarlane et al (2011) identified a positive association with postcodes containing flying-fox roosts, and with geographic seasonal low rainfall, but found no evident association with horse density and vegetation primary productivity [20]. One of us (Smith, CS., unpublished data) previously found an association with radial proximity to flying-fox roosts, with a statistically significant increased risk of equine cases within 7 km of a known roost. Fogarty et al (2008) showed that Hendra virus survival in-vitro decreased with increasing temperature and desiccation [21], supporting the contention that climatic variables likely contribute to infection risk for horses. Correlates with the presence of anti-Hendra virus antibodies in flying-foxes are better understood, and include species, age, location, year, reproductive status (pregnancy or lactation) and season [6], [15], [22], [23].",

Hot spot analysis (Getis-Ord Gi*, zone of indifference conceptualisation) identified areas with statistically significant clustering of Hendra virus spillovers [35]. Geographically weighted regression (GWS) was used to investigate the spatial pattern of spillovers in relation to environmental data. The latter were identified using ordinary least squares (OLS). Kernel density and inverse distance weighted were employed to interpolate data. All variables were included in the initial OLS model. A variable inflation factor (VIF) >7.5 suggested redundancy amongst variables and they were removed from the model in succession. Heteroscedasticity, or the relationship between predicted values and changes in variable magnitudes, was measured using the Koenker (BP) Statistic. OLS models that display statistically significant heteroscedasiticity (P<0.05) should use the reported Robust P, and are good candidates for GWR. Variables that did not have a statistically significant Robust P (P<0.1) were removed from the model in succession. Table 1 indicates the variables used in OLS and GWR. All spatial analysis was undertaken in Arcmap 10, Spatial Statistics Tools (ESRI, USA).",

Despite the recent availability of a vaccine for horses, it remains important that horse owners continue to implement risk management strategies that minimise horse exposure to Hendra virus. Our findings validate anecdotal assessments of a spatial risk component to Hendra virus infection in horses. They indicate that equine incidents are indeed spatially clustered, indicating underlying spatially occurring risk factors, and that multiple equine infection hot spots exist along the eastern Australia coast. Furthermore, we have shown that the density of two related species of flying-fox, P. alecto and P. conspicillatus, has a strong positive correlation with equine case locations. This finding suggests that these species play a primary role in Hendra virus infection of horses. We continue to seek other unidentified risk-contributing variables and to refine our model accordingly.",
