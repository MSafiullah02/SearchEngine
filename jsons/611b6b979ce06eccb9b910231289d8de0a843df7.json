Cyclosporin A (CsA), a cyclophilin (Cyp) inhibitor, inhibits the replication of FCoV in vitro and in vivo as well as the replication of human and animal coronaviruses. However, the mechanism underlying the regulation of coronavirus replication by CsA is unknown. In this study, we analysed the role of Cyps in FCoV replication using knockdown and knockout cells specific to Cyps. Inhibition of CypA and CypB reduced FCoV replication, with replication in knockout cells being much less than that in knockdown cells. Furthermore, the proteins expressed by CypA and CypB harbouring mutations in their respective predicted peptidyl-prolyl cis-transisomerase active sites, which also alter the affinities between Cyps and CsA, inhibited FCoV replication. These findings indicate that the peptidyl-prolyl cistransisomerase active sites of Cyps might be required for FCoV replication.",

            "text": "Viral replication requires numerous host factors [5, 6] that represent potential targets of antiviral therapy. RNA viral genomes typically replicate with low fidelity and undergo rapid evolutionary changes. Therefore, inhibitors targeting host factors may be preferred as the development of resistance is less likely. Cyclophilins (Cyps) and FK506-binding proteins belong to peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase (PPIase) families that catalyse cis-trans isomerization of the imidic prolyl peptide bond and are pharmacological targets of cyclosporin A (CsA) and FK506 [7, 8] . CsA is a well-known immunosuppressive drug that binds to cellular Cyps to inhibit calcineurin, a calcium-calmodulin-activated serine/threonine-specific phosphatase. The inhibition of calcineurin blocks the translocation of the nuclear factor of activated T cells from the cytosol into the nucleus, thus preventing the transcription of genes encoding cytokines, such as interleukin-2. CsA is a potent inhibitor of certain human and animal CoVs [9, 10] . However, FK506 also suppresses calcineurin activity and signalling through the nuclear factor of activated T cells at the same stage as CsA but without affecting FCoV replication [11] . Moreover, the replication of animal CoVs such as infectious bronchitis virus and transmissible gastroenteritis virus is not inhibited by FK506 [12] . However, this drug effectively inhibits the replication of human CoVs, severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV), HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E [13] . This indicates that the mechanism underlying CoV replication between human and animals requires different cellular immunophilins such as Cyps and FK506-binding proteins. The mechanism underlying the inhibitory effects of CsA on CoV replication is poorly understood, although the fact that CypA and CypB do not affect SARS-CoV replication [9] is important. Furthermore, HCoV-NL63 replication depends on CypA but not CypB [14] . In addition, single-nucleotide polymorphism variants near the human CypA active site are required for HCoV-229E replication [12] .",

Western blot and RT-qPCR analyses showed that viral replications in the CypA-KO and CypB-KO cells infected with FCoV were reduced by more than 95 % compared with those in the infected parent fcwf-4 cells (Fig. 5b) , indicating that both CypA and CypB proteins significantly contribute to FCoV replication.",

Although the protein expression level of CypB-F67A mutant was less than that of the CypB-R62A mutant as predicted in Fig. S2 , FCoV-N expression levels were reduced by approximately 70 % in the cells transfected with plasmids encoding each mutant residue (Fig. 6d, e) .

Furthermore, Cyp expression was inhibited in cells transfected with respective Cyp-specific shRNAs. FCoV replication and protein expression were restored in KD-CypA-fcwf and KD-CypB-fcwf cells transfected with wild-type CypA and CypB expression vectors. However, FCoV replication was not completely inhibited in KD-CypA-fcwf or KD-CypB-fcwf cells. Hypothetically, the low residual levels of CypA and CypB in these cells supported viral replication, or other Cyps or host factors compensated for the decreased activities of CypA and CypB. Consequently, we examined the role of CypA and CypB in FCoV replication using CypA-KO and CypB-KO cell lines. While we searched for other feline CypA paralog genes using Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genome software, we found one paralog sequence. Two CypA gene types were located on A2 and C2 genomes, respectively. There were four nucleotide differences, which translated into two different amino acid residues. With regard to CypB, no paralog sequence was found. However, the guide RNA sequence used for CypA in this study targeted the same sequence between those CypAs. These data suggest that both CypA and CypB play important roles in FCoV replication. However, RT-qPCR analysis showed that FCoV replication was not completely inhibited in Cyps-KO cells. These results suggest that other host factors compensated for activities of CypA and CypB, e.g. protein interacting with NIMA (Pin1), a member of the parvulin subfamily of PPIases, modulates FCoV propagation [18] .",

The activities of these mutants were reduced by 190-1000-fold compared with those of wild-type. Although we did not examine whether all mutants lack PPIase activities in this study, all active sites are conserved in other species' CypA. There is no conclusive proof that the CypA (R55A, F60A and H126Q) mutants inhibited FCoV replication by dominant-negative effects on PPIase activity. However, all three active sites drastically reduced binding ability with CsA as shown by MOE software analysis. Our present findings suggest that CsA-binding ability of CypA is related with FCoV replication. In contrast, FCoV-N expression levels in fcwf-4 cells expressing wildtype CypA were not significantly different from those in cells transfected with the control vector (Fig. 6a ). This conflicts with the data shown in Fig. 1(a) and raises the possibility that FCoV replication in fcwf-4 cells stably expressing wild-type CypA is affected to a greater extent than that in over-expressing cells.",

Cyps with PPIase activity catalyse protein folding [8, 20] and mediate the life cycles of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 and hepatitis C virus [19] . The RNA chaperone domain of the N protein of CoV encircles genomic RNA (gRNA) to form a helical ribonucleoprotein structure [21, 22] . The N protein may participate in the discontinuous transcription of subgenomic mRNAs (sgmRNAs) because depletion of N from the replicon inhibits the synthesis of sgmRNA but not that of gRNA [23] . DDX1 is a cellular RNA helicase of the DEAD box helicase family, and KD of DDX1 reduces quantities of longer infectious bronchitis virus viral RNAs [24] . Phosphorylation of the N protein allows recruitment of DDX1 to the phosphorylated-N-containing complex that facilitates template reading, thereby enabling the synthesis of longer sgmRNAs [24] . Because the N protein of SARS-CoV binds CypA and CypA is incorporated into SARS-CoV particles [25] , CsA may act directly on CypA/N protein complexes to prevent CoV from synthesizing gRNA and sgmRNA. However, we have yet to determine whether CypA/ N protein complexes are incorporated into virion particles. The replication of human and animal CoVs requires different Cyps. For example, CypA and CypB do not facilitate SARS-CoV replication [9] , and the replication of human HCoV-NL63 requires CypA but not CypB [14] . This is a contradiction to our data showing that both CypA and CypB are required for FCoV replication. However, we have no evidence that other animal CoVs require different Cyps in replication. The different requirement for Cyps in viral replication between human and animal CoVs may result from the binding affinity of viral proteins to Cyp domains. Furthermore, previous studies on human CoV were performed using KD systems but not KO systems in vitro.",

The mutated amino acid residues are located near the PPIase active site, which is consistent with our present data. The mutant proteins of CypA and CypB used in this study strikingly reduce the affinities between CsA and Cyps (Figs S1 and S2). These findings may indicate that those affinities between CsA and Cyps affect FCoV replication. It may be presumed that any host or viral factors bind CsA-binding regions of Cyps to contribute to FCoV replication. Namely, CsA might competitively bind the regions against those factors to inhibit FCoV replication. Further research on the role of CsA-binding regions of Cyps in FCoV replication would clarify the mechanism of inhibition of FCoV and other CoV replication by CsA.",

The 5\u00a2-and 3\u00a2-regions of CypA and CypB were cloned using the FirstChoice RLM-RACE Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Genes encoding Cyp were cloned into the pEF6/Myc-His A vector (Invitrogen) that contains the blasticidin-resistance gene for selection of stable cell lines, and the vectors were termed pEF-Myc-CypA and pEF-Myc-CypB. Sequences of the PCR primers are shown in Table 1 . For mutagenesis, we generated the isomerase active-site mutants and calcineurin-binding region mutants of feline CypA (CypA-R55A, CypA-F60A, CypA-H126Q), as described by Zydowsky et al. [16] , and those of feline CypB (Cyp-B-R62A, CypB-F67A), as described by Carpentier et al. [17, 26] .

(a) fcwf-4 cells transfected with vectors, which express Myc-tagged CypA mutants (CypA-R55A, CypA-R60A and CypA-H126Q), were infected with FCoV. Cell lysates were prepared for Western blot analysis at 20 h p.i. The transferred membrane was incubated with anti-FCoV-N, anti-Myc, anti-CypA, anti-CypB and anti-bactin antibodies. FCoV-N expression levels were normalized to that of b-actin, and all strips were excised from the same membrane. (b) Western blot analysis of the effect of CypA mutants on FCoV-N expression. FCoV-N protein expression levels were normalized to that of b-actin.

(d) fcwf-4 cells transfected with vectors, which express Myc-tagged CypB mutants (CypB-R62A and CypB-F67A), were infected with FCoV, and cell lysates were prepared for Western blot analysis at 20 h p.i.

Asterisk indicates significant differences (*P<0.05) in (b), (c), (e) and (f). sh-B710 vectors were used to transfect into fcwf-4 cells in the presence of X-tremeGENE HP DNA Transfection Reagent. Transfected cells were selected by treating cells with 6 \u00b5g ml \u00c01 puromycin (Sigma-Aldrich), 24 h posttransfection. Stably transfected cell lines were obtained from each colony isolated after a 3 week selection. The fewf-4 cell lines established with the sh-A161 vector were termed KD-CypA-fcwf cells, and those cell lines established with the sh-B710 vector were termed KD-CypB-fcwf cells. Inhibition of protein expression by shRNAs was estimated by Western blot. Those KD cells were infected with the FCoV 79-1146 strain at a m.o.i. of 1 p.f.u. per cell to study the effects on FCoV infection before cells were collected for Western blot and RT-qPCR analyses at 20 h post-infection (p.i.).",
