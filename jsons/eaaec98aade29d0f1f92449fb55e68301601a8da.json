Bta-miR-1434-5p, \u2212 188, \u2212200c were up-regulated (> 1.5 folds) while bta-miR-27a-5p, \u221234b and -2285x were down-regulated (> 100 folds) in Brucellosis group. In Johne's Disease group, only 3 miRNAs (bta-miR-1434-5p, \u2212 2340 and \u2212 2484) were up-regulated (> 1.5 folds). The functional classification of miRNA target genes into gene ontology (GO) terms indicated their involvement in innate immunity and cellular process of disease pathogenesis. Expression profile of four differentially expressed miRNAs (bta-miR-9-5p, \u2212 677, \u2212 331-3p and \u2212 2440) and eight predicted target-genes were validated through reverse transcriptase qPCR.",

The goals of this study were to identify PBMCs miRNAs profiles in Indian water buffalo associated with economically devastating diseases, namely, brucellosis and paratuberculosis (Johne's disease or JD). Brucellosis an important zoonotic disease of livestock is caused by facultative, gram-negative bacteria of Brucella genus. This intracellular organism generally enters the host via the nasal and oral routes followed by invasion and proliferation within monocytic phagocytes [5] . It spreads via macrophages to the lymph nodes, spleen, liver, bone marrow, mammary glands, and reproductive organs. Another important disease that has been encountered in dairy animals is the paratuberculosis (Johne's disease or JD) caused by Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis (MAP). Calves mainly acquire the infection through oral route by uptake of MAP via colostrum, milk or feed contaminated with fecal matter [6] or via intrauterine route [7] . Following the invasion, the bacteria primarily resides in the mucosal tissues of gut and its associated lymph nodes and spreads to bloodstream, milk and other peripheral tissues [8] . MAP being an obligate intracellular pathogen resides in host macrophages and enhance its survival by inhibiting intracellular phagosomal activation and maturation [9, 10] . Thus, Brucellosis and JD, causes substantial economic losses to livestock worldwide and hence scientific research has been focused on their diagnosis, prevention, and control.",

Further, infection with M. paratuberculosis is shown to be associated with upregulated expression of genes (Bad, CIDE-A, Fas, TNFRI) responsible for promoting apoptosis as well as genes (tissue inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinases, TIMP-1 and TIMP-2) having role in modeling extracellular matrix and tissue [23] .

For example, the bta-miR-9-5p and \u2212 331-3p that were observed to be down-regulated (~12 and~51 folds, respectively) in Br-Mu and JD-Mu, respectively, as compared to control; showed down-regulation (2.5 and 2.12 folds, respectively) by the qPCR with respect to RNU6 endogenous control.

Out of these, 3 predicted target genes viz. YBX3, SNX25, TM9SF3, followed the common negative regulatory function of miRNAs where up-regulated expression of miRNA in Brucella positive group resulted in the downregulation of target gene expression or vice versa. However, recent findings suggest that miRNAs can also promote the target gene expression in association with microRNP complexes [60, 61] . An example of such a remarkable association was observed herein study as well where NR3C1 was found to be upregulated in the Brucella positive group having upregulated bta-miR-677 expression. Likewise, in JD positive group, the down-regulated expression of target genes (BZRAP1 and CPSF2; RAB39B and RIMKLA) was observed even when the miRNAs (bta-miR-331-3p and bta-miR-331-3p, respectively) were downregulated.",
