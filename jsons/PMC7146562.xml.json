However, dysregulated inflammatory processes result in chronic inflammation, which is increasingly seen as a major driver of numerous diseases such as obesity and type 2 diabetes [1]. Obese adipose tissue produces inflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1, monocyte chemokine protein (MCP)-1, and interleukin (IL)-6 [1]. Subsequently, the elevated inflammatory stimuli induce the activation of the inhibitor of \u03baB (I\u03baB) kinase (IKK)/NF-\u03baB and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathways, which negatively regulate insulin action in not only adipose tissue, but also other peripheral tissues, such as liver [2]. Thus, the accumulation of pro-inflammatory responses in adipose tissue may be one of the causal factors for insulin resistance. A previous study has demonstrated that pro-inflammatory gene expression is elevated in adipose tissue in the early onset of obesity, but in other tissues, such as liver and skeletal muscle, there is no differences in the expression of inflammatory gene expressions [3]. Thus, adipose tissues appear to act as priming tissues that respond to a high-fat diet (HFD) and initiate inflammation in obesity. Therefore, understanding the inflammatory responses in adipose tissues of obese individuals is of clinical importance.",

AMPK can be activated by various conditions. Starvation, hypoxia, exercise, and oxidative damages are the main cellular stresses for activating AMPK [4]. There are two well-known upstream kinases: liver kinase B1 (LKB1) and Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase (CaMKK) can activate AMPK via phosphorylation. Several reports clearly demonstrated that one of the major roles of AMPK is regulating metabolic requirement. For example, AMPK stimulates energy production pathways through fatty acid oxidation, mitochondrial biogenesis, and glucose catabolism. On the other hand, it inhibits energy-consuming pathways, including fatty acids\u2019 synthesis and amino acids\u2019 biogenesis [5]. Thus, dysfunctions of AMPK or downstream signaling pathways could result in metabolic diseases, such as obesity and type 2 diabetes [4].",

The activation of AMPK by AICAR (5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-\u03b2-D-ribofuranoside) can inhibit colitis [7], autoimmune encephalomyelitis [8], and inflammation after lung injury [9]. In contrast, disrupting AMPK-mediated signaling in hematopoietic-derived cells induced the infiltration of adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs) and hepatic steatosis [10]. In addition, pro-inflammatory responses inhibited the activation of AMPK in adipose tissue and induced the expression of pro-inflammatory genes in vivo [11]. It has been reported that the infiltration of ATMs is significantly increased in AMPK\u03b11\u2212/\u2212 mice, and these mice showed increased expression of pro-inflammatory genes, such as IL-6 or TNF-\u03b1, in adipose tissue [12]. Together, these observations that AMPK can suppress inflammation have a significant impact on obese-mediated inflammation in adipose tissue.",

It has been shown that Broussonetia papyrifera has anti-tyrosinase and antioxidant activity [13,14] and anti-inflammatory activities in cells [15]. Constituents of the roots of this plant, broussochalcone A, kazinol A, and kazinol I, have been reported as inhibitors of lipopolysaccharide-induced nitric oxide (NO) production by suppressing NF-\u03baB activation in macrophages [16,17]. Moreover, kazinol B, a B. papyrifera-derived prenylated flavan, has been shown to inhibit NO production [16]. Interestingly, kazinol B enhances glucose uptake via Akt (a serine/threonine kinase) and AMPK activation in adipocytes [17]. Collectively, these reports suggest that B. papyrifera might ameliorate inflammation, but to what degree it elicits systemic insulin sensitivity, and by what mechanism, remains unclear. In the present study, we aimed to demonstrate that roots of B. papyrifera improve pre-established insulin resistance and identify major bioactive compounds that modulate obese-associated inflammation in adipose tissue.",

Briefly, the total B. papyrifera root bark extracts (TPRE, yield 10.05%) were separated by SPOT-II MPLC (medium-pressure liquid chromatography) (Gilson, Middleton, WI, USA) using reversed-phase silica gel (YMC-Pack ODS-AQ HG, 20 \u00d7 250 mm, 10 \u03bcm, Kyoto, Japan) eluted with MeOH-H2O to give TPRE Nos. 1\u20138 (Figure S1A and Figure 1B). Broussoflavonol B and kazinol J were found to be components of TPRE No. 6 (PRE) based on the UPLC-PDA-QTof-MS chromatograms (Figure S1C). Among these fractions, TPRE No. 6 (PRE) was subjected to a GX-271 (automated liquid handler) semipreparative HPLC system (Gilson, Middleton, WI) using a reversed-phase column (YMC-Pack ODS-AQ-HG, 10\u03bcm) and eluted with the MeOH-H2O gradient system (55% \u2192 100% MeOH, 70 min) by 25 repeated injections of the samples (2 g/mL methanol dilutions) to yield four fractions (PRE Nos. 6\u20131~6\u20134). A further preparation.-HPLC procedure was repeated several times using each condition (see below). The fraction 6\u20133\u20135 (345.1 mg) enriched with broussoflavonol B was further isolated by prep.-HPLC (Gilson, Middleton, MA, USA). Broussoflavonol B (44.9 mg) and broussonol D (29.4 mg) were isolated using a YMC-Pack pro C8 column. The fraction 6\u20133\u20137 enriched with kazinol J was further isolated by prep.-HPLC (PLC 2020) with a gradient system of MeOH-H2O, and (-)\u2013(2S)\u2013kazinol I (7.6 mg), kazinol J (48.7 mg), broussoflavonol C (215.7 mg), and broussonol G (40.6 mg) were obtained. The isolated compounds were purified as described previously, and purity the was more than 95.0%, as determined by ultra-performance liquid chromatography [18]. Two compounds were characterized using spectroscopic data, including 1H, 13C NMR, and HRMS, in comparison with previously published data [16,19]. An ACQUITY UPLC\u2122 system (Waters Corporation, Milford, MA, USA) equipped with a binary solvent delivery manager and a photodiode array (PDA) was used for UPLC (ultra-performance liquid chromatography) analysis. HRMS analysis was performed using an ultra-performance liquid chromatography quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-QTOF-MS) equipped with an electrospray ionization (ESI) interface (Waters Q-TOF PremierTM, Waters Corporation, Milford, MA, USA). The NMR analysis was carried out using a Fourier transform (FT)-NMR spectrometer (JEOL ECZ500R, JEOL Ltd., Akishima, Tokyo, Japan) for 1D spectra (1H NMR and 13C NMR). The overall processes are described in Figure S1D. All extracts and single compounds for the experiments were prepared by dissolving in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA).",

Differentiated adipocytes were treated with TNF-\u03b1, and we examined the effects of PRE on the expression of pro-inflammatory genes. As shown in Figure 2A, PRE repressed the TNF-\u03b1-mediated pro-inflammatory gene, and this effect was dose-dependent. Furthermore, PRE blocked lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced pro-inflammatory response in Raw264.7 cells, as previously reported (Figure S3) [18]. AMPK is a well-known, important inflammatory suppressor, and AMPK signaling critically regulates inflammation in many cell types [6]. Therefore, to further investigate the molecular mechanism involved in PRE-associated repression of the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway, we first tested whether PRE activated AMPK. In 3T3-L1 adipocytes, PRE enhanced the phosphorylation of AMPK, while PRE did not affect AMPK protein level. This phosphorylation was blocked by compound C, a specific inhibitor of AMPK (Figure 2B). Similarly, the phosphorylation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), a substrate of AMPK, was enhanced by PRE treatment, and its phosphorylation was blocked by compound C treatment. PRE treatment decreased TNF-\u03b1-induced phosphorylation of I\u03baB and NF-\u03baB in adipocytes (Figure 2C). In addition, pretreatment with AICAR specifically inhibited TNF-\u03b1-mediated pro-inflammatory signaling. Pretreatment with compound C blocked PRE-induced suppression of phosphorylation of I\u03baB and NF-\u03baB in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (Figure 2C). Together, these results strongly suggest that PRE suppresses TNF-\u03b1-mediated pro-inflammatory gene expression by activating AMPK.",

Consistent with NF-\u03baB activity, treatment with BF and KJ downregulated TNF-\u03b1-stimulated pro-inflammatory gene expression (Il-6, Mcp-1, and iNOS-only in the BF-treated group) in adipocytes (Figure 6D). In addition, both BF and KJ decreased I\u03baB degradation and NF-\u03baB phosphorylation, and compound C significantly blocked them (Figure 6E). They also suppressed LPS-mediated NO production in Raw264.7 (Figure S7). Together, these results strongly indicated that BF and KJ were bioactive compounds of PRE and could block an inflammatory response through blocking the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway via AMPK activation.",

            "text": "Obesity is very closely related to chronic and low-grade inflammation. Many reports have suggested that insulin resistance accompanies chronic inflammation and abnormal mediator secretion in obese adipose tissue [21], indicating that reduction of tissue inflammation could be an indispensable target for improving obesity-related metabolic syndromes. It has been reported that roots of B. papyrifera have been used as a suppressant for edema in traditional Chinese medicine [22]. The core phytochemicals in the roots of B. papyrifera are flavonols, flavans, and chalcones [23]. There is emerging evidence that these core phytochemicals have anti-inflammatory activities. [15,16,24]. In the present study, we focused on the anti-inflammatory effects of PRE in adipose tissue and investigated whether it could ameliorate systemic insulin resistance in obese mice. PRE potently inhibited TNF-\u03b1-induced inflammatory responses by suppressing NF-\u03baB activation in adipocytes. This effect improved not only glucose tolerance, but also hepatic steatosis in HFD-induced obese mice. Using the FDA guideline to calculate human equivalent doses (HED), the HED of this effective dose of PRE (40 mg/kg) was 195 mg/day in humans. This dose was lower than that of metformin (850 mg~2550mg/day) even though PRE was a crude extract. Furthermore, BF and KJ, the isolated phytochemicals from PRE, were the bioactive compounds that suppressed inflammatory responses in 3T3-L1 adipocytes through blocking NF-\u03baB signaling. Of significance, these effects were partially dependent on AMPK activation in adipocytes (Figure S8).",

            "text": "AMPK has been shown to have strong anti-inflammatory activity via inhibiting inflammatory responses in various in vivo models [6]. Various studies have shown that AMPK inhibits pro-inflammatory signaling in many tissues and cells, especially adipocytes and macrophages, which are the main cell types of adipose tissue [25,26]. In addition, AMPK ameliorates insulin resistance in obesity [10,11,25,26]. It has been reported that AMPK activators specifically suppressed the expression of pro-inflammatory genes and the activation of NF-\u03baB-mediated signaling [27,28]. The molecular mechanism for NF-\u03baB activation is: (1) the degradation of I\u03baB in a ubiquitin-dependent manner is triggered through its phosphorylation by IKK; (2) I\u03baB degradation results in nuclear translocation of NF-\u03baB [29]. Based on these results, we proposed the roles of PRE and its constituents to inhibit NF-\u03baB transcriptional activity through the blockade of phosphorylation-mediated I\u03baB degradation and NF-\u03baB phosphorylation; this effect was reversed by inhibition of AMPK. Thus, PRE-mediated NF-\u03baB inactivation would likely be accompanied by inhibition of the TNF-\u03b1-stimulated IKK/I\u03baB/NF-\u03baB signaling pathway. In addition to the identified signaling pathways, it remains to be elucidated whether other molecular mechanisms for the AMPK-mediated anti-inflammatory effect of PRE exist. AMPK has several phosphorylation targets [30], but there are some reports suggesting that AMPK could inhibit NF-\u03baB activity and its signaling indirectly via sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) [11], the forkhead box O (FoxO) family [30], and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b3 co-activator (PGC-1\u03b1) [31], which are known as downstream mediators of AMPK. These mediators could inactivate the p65 subunit of NF-\u03baB, and the expression of pro-inflammatory genes is subsequently repressed. Thus, further studies related to the underlying mechanism of how PRE and its active components regulate AMPK activation and its resultant anti-inflammatory effect are needed.",

The cells were treated with BF and KJ as the indicated concentration for 24 h, followed by treatment with TNF-\u03b1 (10 ng/mL) for an additional 6 h. The cells were harvested, and luciferase activity was measured. Data are shown as the mean \u00b1 S.E.M. (n = 3) * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.001; *** p < 0.0001 vs. the TNF-\u03b1-only-treated group. (D) After 3T3-L1 adipocytes were pretreated with/without compound C, cells were incubated with/without BF or KJ for 24 h and stimulated with TNF-\u03b1 (20 ng/mL) for 30 min. The expressions of phospho-I\u03baB, I\u03baB, phospho-NF-\u03baB, NF-\u03baB, and tubulin were analyzed by Western blotting. (E) 3T3-L1 adipocytes were pre-incubated with the indicated concentration of BF or KJ for 24 h, followed by treatment with 20 ng/mL TNF-\u03b1 for 5 h. Total RNA was isolated, and the mRNA expression level of each gene was analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR. Data are shown as the mean \u00b1 S.E.M. (n = 3) * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.001; *** p < 0.0001 vs. the TNF-\u03b1-only-treated group.",
