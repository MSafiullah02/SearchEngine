While the mechanisms underlying this ability to avoid sickness are not known, deep sequencing studies of bat genomes have uncovered genetic adaptations that may have functional importance in the antiviral response of these animals. Egyptian rousette bats (Rousettus aegyptiacus) are the natural reservoir hosts of Marburg virus (MARV). In contrast to humans, these bats do not become sick when infected with MARV. A striking difference to the human genome is that Egyptian rousettes have an expanded repertoire of IFNW genes. To probe the biological implications of this expansion, we synthesized IFN-\u03c94 and IFN-\u03c99 proteins and tested their antiviral activity in Egyptian rousette cells. Both IFN-\u03c94 and IFN-\u03c99 showed antiviral activity against RNA viruses, including MARV, with IFN-\u03c99 being more efficient than IFN-\u03c94. Using RNA-Seq, we examined the transcriptional response induced by each protein. Although the sets of genes induced by the two IFNs were largely overlapping, IFN-\u03c99 induced a more rapid and intense response than did IFN-\u03c94. About 13% of genes induced by IFN-\u03c9 treatment are not found in the Interferome or other ISG databases, indicating that they may be uniquely IFN-responsive in this bat.",

Type I IFNs are induced by the recognition of viral pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), and act by inducing interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) that collectively contribute to an antiviral response (4, 5) . All type I IFNs bind to and signal through the same heterodimeric receptor complex IFNAR1/2, but both evolutionary analyses and functional studies suggest that multiple IFN subtypes make non-redundant contributions to immunity (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) . Although the exact functional contribution for each IFN is not completely understood, differences in the interaction of various IFN subtypes with IFNAR1/2 are known to differentially induce downstream ISGs (10) (11) (12) . As a result, differences in pathogen-specific antiviral effect are possible, depending on the amount and profile of ISGs induced by a particular IFN.",

Whereas, humans have a single IFNW gene, almost half of the Egyptian rousette IFN genes belong to the IFN-\u03c9 subtype. The functional relevance of the expansion is not known. In humans and other species, IFN-\u03c9 is induced by viral infection and has potent antiviral activity against various RNA viruses, including vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), bovine viral diarrhea virus, yellow fever virus, West Nile virus, and influenza A virus (20) (21) (22) (23) (24) . Multiple subtypes of porcine IFN-\u03c9 are expressed after viral infection and have dramatic differences in activity despite very few single nucleotide polymorphisms (23) . The ISGs induced specifically by these IFN-\u03c9 proteins, however, are not known. To begin to understand the role of these genes in the immune response to viruses in bats, we synthesized and purified recombinant Egyptian rousette IFN-\u03c9 proteins.

Phylogenetic analysis shows that the 22 IFNs are divided into five distinct groups: two large clades, each containing IFNs with >0.847 amino acid pairwise identity, one pair of IFNs sharing 0.989 identity with each other and <0.681 with any other, and two single IFNs with maximum homology of 0.832 to any other ( Figure 1A) . The IFNAR1 and IFNAR2 binding sites in all human type I IFNs, including IFN-\u03c9, have been well-characterized (12) . We annotated the broad collection of residues that participate in receptor binding on all 22 proteins using the NCBI conserved domain database search. While proteins within a clade have high identity at these receptorbinding sites, these sites are much less conserved between clades ( Table 1) .",

            "text": "Although all human type I IFNs bind to the same receptor complex, their downstream signaling upon binding differs among types and subtypes. Crystal structure analysis of two human type I IFNs bound to their receptor has led to a model that connects differences in receptor recognition and conformation to differences in downstream signaling (12) . According to this model, ligand residues that interact with the receptor are classified into three groups. First, there are conserved \"anchor\" residues-those that are identical among all or most human IFN subtypes. Second, there are conserved \"modulating\" residues that are identical among all or most human IFN subtypes but when mutated, change the energetics of the ligand-receptor interaction and lead to functional changes. Third, there are \"ligand-specific\" residues that vary greatly among human IFN subtypes (12) . We examined several rousette IFN-\u03c9 subtypes using this classification and compared residues that were identified as functionally important. The \"anchor, \" \"modulating, \" and \"ligand-specific\" residues are overall fairly conserved between the human and at least one of the bat IFN-\u03c9 proteins ( Figure 1B) . However, when comparing the bat proteins, there is noticeable diversity among the \"ligandspecific\" residues. Additionally, by definition, conservation of the \"modulating\" residues does not guarantee an energetically equal reaction with the receptor subunits. Together, this suggests that the five rousette IFN-\u03c9 groups are likely to react with the receptor with different kinetics and affinities, potentially resulting in different downstream effects.",

Although both rIFN-\u03c94 and rIFN-\u03c99 showed antiviral activity against VSV, this effect was more pronounced for rIFN-\u03c99, which was effective at concentrations a 100-fold less than IFN-\u03c94 after 4 h treatment, and even lower concentrations after 8 h treatment (Figure 2) . Predicted signal sequences were cleaved for each protein. Annotations and putative receptor binding sites are based on the structure of the human IFN-\u03c9-IFNAR1/2 complex (12) . Residues important for interacting with IFNAR1 are highlighted in green, and residues that interact with IFNAR2 are highlighted in orange. Black stars indicate conserved residues that help anchor human IFNs to receptor subunits, and blue stars indicate conserved residues that influence the energetics of receptor binding. All residues highlighted as interacting with IFNAR1 or IFNAR2 but without stars are considered \"ligand-specific\" according to the model in Thomas et al. (12) . We treated RoNi/7.1 cells with UIFN, or three different concentrations of rIFN-\u03c94, rIFN-\u03c99, or rD1 for 4 or 8 h and collected RNA for mRNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) and differential gene expression analysis. We first compared the effect of treatment on mean expression of each gene via an ANOVA-like test for differential expression. For each gene rejecting the null in the ANOVA analysis (ANOVA FDR < 0.05) (Figure 3A) , every IFN treatment condition was contrasted with the appropriate control treatment; rIFN-\u03c9-treated samples were compared to rD1-treated samples at the same concentration and time point. UIFN-treated samples were compared to untreated samples at the same time point in a pairwise analysis. The total numbers of genes that passed our pairwise reporting criteria (2-fold expression change or greater and Bonferroni-corrected p < 0.05) are shown in Figure 3B and Table S1 . Most of the differentially expressed genes were upregulated relative to the corresponding control, and there were very few downregulated genes across all conditions. This trend of positive gene expression has also been seen with UIFN treatment of cells from the black flying fox (Pteropus alecto) (14) . IFN concentrations that were not observed to be antiviral in our VSV-eGFP assay induced very few genes (Figures 2,  3B) . For example, 0.01 ng/mL of rIFN-\u03c99 induced only six genes after 4 h and 14 genes after 8 h (Table S1 ). In contrast, IFN concentrations that blocked VSV-eGFP replication induced many more genes. For a given concentration, many genes were induced at both time points (Figure 3C) . At a given time point, almost every gene induced at a low IFN concentration was also induced at a high concentration, with the main exception being 4 h rIFN-\u03c99 treatment, where 61 genes were induced by 1 ng/mL but not by 100 ng/mL ( Figure 3D and Table S1 ).",

Since these databases are composed of data from other species (27), we excluded any MHC genes from the analysis as these gene evolve in complex ways and homology is inherently uncertain among species. We cross-referenced the remaining genes with data from (1) the Interferome-a database of ISGs from a wide variety of human and mouse studies (27); (2) data from a recent analysis of the IFN response in ten different species (25) ; and (3) ImmGen-a database of ISGs from a variety of human immune cells (26) . In our hands, more than 95% of genes induced by UIFN were found in the at least one of these three databases. In contrast, of the 358 genes upregulated by either IFN-\u03c9 at any time point or concentration, 87.4% (313 genes) were found in at least one database, and 12.6% (52 genes) were not. These percentages are slightly lower than those found in similar studies with UIFN and recombinant IFN-\u03b13 in the black flying fox (14, 17) . This is partly because we use multiple databases that capture ISGs across a number of species and cell types and partly because there are differences in the total number of upregulated genes in those studies.",

Humans have two functional Mx genes and seven functional genes each in the GIMAP and GBP subfamilies. GVIN1 is an interferoninducible gene in other species but is only a pseudogene in the human genome. IFN-\u03c94 or -\u03c99 treatment of RoNi/7.1 cells led to the induction of nine different GIMAPs, five GBPs, and three GVIN genes ( Figure 4C and Table S1 ). In contrast, UIFN induced only three interferon-inducible GTPases other than Mx genes suggesting that IFN-\u03c9s may be able to induce a more diverse ISG response by tapping into expanded families of GTPase-related genes. Consistent with this hypothesis, the bat IFN-\u03c9s induced all but one of the ISGs that were induced by UIFN, as well as additional ISGs that were not induced by UIFN (Figure 5) . Fifty four genes were expressed only with IFN-\u03c99 treatment, while five were induced only with IFN-\u03c94 treatment.

Surprisingly, neither UIFN nor IFN-\u03c9s led to RNASEL induction in our experiments. This may be due to species, cell-type, or treatment time and concentration differences. A higher basal (rather than inducible) expression of RNASEL was observed in Egyptian rousette cells (29) , which could further support the hypothesis of a species-specific difference among bats. There are a number of ISGs that were shown to have antiviral activity against filoviruses, including tetherin, Zinc finger antiviral protein (ZAP), interferon-induced transmembrane (IFITM) proteins, and ISG15 [reviewed in (30) ].

However, several members of the GBP family in humans and/or mice have been shown to have antiviral activity against VSV, influenza A virus, encephalomyocarditis virus, and retroviruses, including HIV-1 (40) (41) (42) . GBPs are recruited to pathogen-containing compartments, including viral replication sites, by autophagy related proteins (43) . Once recruited, they exert a variety of antiviral activities that interfere with various steps of the viral replication cycle within these compartments, coordinate lysis or lysosomal fusion, and activate the inflammasome (44, 45) . For example, GBP1 inhibits the delivery of Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus virions to the nucleus by interfering with actin filament organization (46) . This blocking mechanism could be significant for MARV infection, given that MARV also relies on actin filaments to transport nucleocapsids to the budding sites (47) . Given their close association with autophagy related proteins, GBPs can direct autophagy for pathogen clearance (45) , which has recently been shown to be one mechanism by which bats can limit viral infection (48) .",

If this phenomenon is also present in bats, the induction of 5 different GBPs by IFN\u03c9 subtypes could mean a second tier of antiviral flexibility. In addition to these varied functions, GBPs play a role in inflammasome activation, either by helping to create PAMPs by lysing pathogen-containing compartments or by promoting caspase-11 activation or both (40) . Fewer inflammasome-related genes and a diminished NLRP3-related inflammasome response have been observed in bats compared to other mammals (51, 52) ; whether the expression of multiple GBPs could compensate for this diminished response with less inflammation remains to be explored.",

A previous gene family analysis showed that the GIMAP family is expanded in the Egyptian rousette compared to a bat ancestor (19) , with 14 putative members. It is striking that nine of the 14 GIMAP genes are induced by IFN-\u03c9 treatment, with only a single GIMAP induced by UIFN treatment. GIMAPs are also expressed in black flying fox cells after UIFN or bat IFN-\u03b1 stimulation (14, 17) , although not as many individual GIMAP genes were observed to be upregulated in these studies.

Kuzmin et al. have previously shown that two Egyptian rousette cell lines transfected with either Egyptian rousette IFN-\u03b2 or a consensus IFN-\u03b1 are able to resist both EBOV and MARV infection (59) , but whether filovirus infection itself induces IFNs in bat cells is unclear. In general, MARV infection seems to suppress immune gene expression in immortalized Egyptian rousette cells, yet there are conflicting studies regarding the extent of this suppression. The EBOV antiviral protein VP35 is known to efficiently inhibit IFN induction in vitro in human cells; in contrast, MARV VP35 is a much weaker inhibitor, and MARV infection of human THP-1 cells does lead to an IFN response (60, 61) . Infection of RoNi/7.1 cells with a MARV isolate from a wild-caught bat did not lead to any IFN induction (29) . A MARV mutant with an impaired VP35 IFN-inhibiting domain only induced IFN-\u03b1 subtypes. In contrast, in the same study, Sendai virus induced multiple IFNs, including low levels of IFN-\u03c9s. MARV infection of R06E-J cells (an Egyptian rousette embryonic cell line) led to modest induction of a few ISGs and no detectable IFN induction (62) . However, a MARV isolate from a patient in Uganda did lead to significant ISG expression in RoNi/7.1 cells, though IFN-\u03c9 genes were not examined (59) . These differences may be attributable to different viral strains, cell lines, and time points. Of note, all these studies were performed with immortalized cells. Even if MARV infection of these cell lines does not lead to IFN-\u03c9 induction, it is still possible that various primary cell types could serve as a source of IFN-\u03c9 in vivo. It has recently been shown that Egyptian rousette dendritic cells that are infected with a bat isolate of MARV upregulate IFNs and ISGs, though the few IFN\u03c9 genes included in the Nanostring-based study were not reported to be significantly upregulated (63) .",

(A) Genes that were significantly differentially expressed in cells treated with 1 or 100 ng/mL rIFN-\u03c94 or rIFN-\u03c99. Only upregulated genes with p \u2264 0.05/3 in the pairwise test were included if expressed after both rIFN-\u03c94 and rIFN-\u03c99 treatment, regardless of treatment time. (B) Pattern of differential expression over time. Genes that passed the significance criteria for the ANOVA tests for a given concentration of IFN at any time point are shown. Figure S2 | Purity of rIFN-\u03c94, rIFN-\u03c99, and rD1 preparations containing 6xHis-tagged recombinant proteins. Recombinant proteins from clarified 293F cell supernatants were purified using affinity chromatography, dialyzed into PBS, quantified by Nanodrop and Bradford assay, and evaluated by (A) silver stain for purity (100 ng/well), and by (B).
