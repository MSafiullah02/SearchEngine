Vasoplegia accounts for severe hypoxaemia. The near normal compliance explains why some patients present without dyspnoea as the patient inhales the volume he expects. The increase in minute volume (mainly in response to hypoxaemia) leads to a decrease in PaCO2. A combination of increased lung permeability (inflammation) and negative inspiratory pressure (increased minute volume by increasing tidal volume) results in interstitial lung oedema. This phenomenon has been recently recognised as the leading cause of patient-self inflicted lung injury (P-SILI).51 With increasing oedema, the gas volume in the lungs decreases, the tidal volumes generated for a given inspiratory pressure decreases, and dyspnoea develops. The transition from type L to H may be due to both the evolution of COVID19 and injury attributable to high-stress ventilation.",

High PEEP, in some patients, may decrease the pleural pressure swings and stop the vicious cycle that exacerbates lung injury. However, high PEEP in patients with normal compliance may have detrimental effects on haemodynamics. In any case, noninvasive options are questionable, as they may be associated with high failure rates and delayed intubation, in a disease which typically lasts several weeks. Once intubated and deeply sedated, the type L patients, if hypercapnic, can be ventilated with volumes greater than 6 ml/kg (up to 8\u20139 ml/kg). as the high compliance results in tolerable strain without the risk of VILI. Prone positioning should be used only as a rescue manoeuvre, as the lung conditions are 'too good' for the prone position effectiveness, which is based on improved stress and strain redistribution. The PEEP should be reduced to 8\u201310 cm H2O, given that the recruit ability is low and the risk of haemodynamic failure increases at higher levels. An early intubation may avert the transition to type H phenotype. Type H patients, should be treated as severe ARDS, including higher PEEP, if compatible with haemodynamics, prone positioning and extracorporeal support.50",
