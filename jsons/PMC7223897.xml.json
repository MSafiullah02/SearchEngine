A trial of tapering inhaled budesonide started at <12 h of life in infants <28 weeks postmenstrual age (PMA) on any positive pressure support showed a significant decrease in BPD at 36 weeks PMA, but there was increased death in the treated group and no information on systemic levels of budesonide.16 Yeh et al. have conducted two unblinded pilot randomized trials of budesonide (0.25 mg/kg) mixed in surfactant (Survanta) versus surfactant alone administered soon after delivery to infants <1500 g with severe respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). Both trials demonstrated a significant decrease in the primary outcome of death or BPD at 36 weeks PMA (p < 0.001) without adverse neurodevelopmental effects at 2 years of age.17\u201319 While these surfactant-based trials are encouraging, further investigation is required to assure efficacy and safety and to establish the lowest effective dose. There are preclinical data supporting the use of a much lower dose of budesonide. For example, budesonide is five times more potent than dexamethasone for suppression of chemokines in fetal human lung explants;20 thus, treatment with 0.25 mg/kg budesonide in surfactant would expose the lung to much higher glucocorticoid levels than i.v. 0.25 mg/kg dexamethasone, an effective systemic dose for prevention of BPD.",

BPD at 36 or 40 weeks PMA was less common in infants in the 0.025 mg/kg group; however, these infants had a higher mean birth weight than the other two groups. Only half of the infants had evidence of increased inflammatory markers in TA at initiation of the study, and these infants had a similar decrease in levels of the two cytokines with treatment at all three dosing levels. There was a dose-dependent increase in both suppression of blood cortisol and in the number of alterations in levels of other blood metabolites indicating systemic absorption and effects of the corticosteroid. These results suggest that intratracheal budesonide reduces lung inflammation only in infants who have elevated inflammatory status, and that this effect occurs at the lowest dose tested (0.025 mg/kg), which has minimal systemic metabolic effects and can be safely repeated if the infant remains intubated.",

Our study did not have concurrent controls nor was it powered to detect significant differences in clinical outcomes. Importantly, in the Yeh studies,18,19 infants were enrolled within the first 24 h of receiving FiO2 > 0.6 and were mechanically ventilated whereas infants in SASSIE were only enrolled if they required mechanical ventilation between postnatal days 3 and 14 and were therefore in the highest risk group (>70%) for BPD.8 The lack of apparent clinical response may also reflect differences in the patient populations. The infants in Yeh\u2019s studies were more mature and larger than the infants in SASSIE. In SASSIE, infants treated within 96 h of dosing for a PDA were excluded to minimize any potential interactions with study medication and this may have biased results.",

To assess local effects of budesonide, we measured two chemokines in lung fluid that are chemoattractants for neutrophils (IL-8) and lymphocytes (MCP1). Both mediators are produced in human fetal lung and are suppressed by glucocorticoids in explant culture.20 Levels of the two chemokines were strongly correlated at both baseline and after treatment, which is consistent with a previous observation for multiple cyto/chemokine levels in TA32 and indicate that our findings likely reflect the overall inflammatory status in the lung. Apparent suppression of IL-8 and MCP1 was observed in half of the SASSIE infants and was strongly associated with higher baseline levels, suggesting that inflammation is not a universal feature of lung injury in the first week and that benefit from budesonide (or any glucocorticoid) will only occur in selected infants with elevated inflammatory status.",

However, the pattern of suppression observed with budesonide, beginning in most infants 12 h after the first dose and sustained during the treatment period, is consistent with suppression in response to budesonide. Also, we used sIgA to normalize chemokine levels to volume of lung fluid in the TA sample; it is possible that sIgA production in vivo varied during the collection period, which would introduce variability in the chemokine data. A limitation of our pharmacokinetic analysis is the absence of data after the 4 h time point; however, our half-life value was similar to that reported by Yeh et al., supporting the accuracy of our PK results.18",
