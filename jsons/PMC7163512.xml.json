            "text": "There is increasing concern that a global pandemic viral infection may seriously affect humans. In 2002 to 2003 a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic, caused by a coronavirus, swept the world. About 8000 people were affected and 780 (including a high number of healthcare workers) died. Overshadowing this calamity was an enormous social and economic crisis, especially in Asia (Shute 2003). There is now increasing concern about the threat of a new viral pandemic, arising from avian influenza, caused by the H5N1 strain (WHO 2004). Although most influenza cases recover fully, in the USA influenza causes approximately 36,000 deaths and 226,000 hospitalisations annually (USDHHS 2005). It is estimated that annually, approximately 10% to 15% of people globally contract influenza. During major epidemics, the attack rate of influenza may be as high as 50%. It is associated with increased general practice consultation rates, hospital admissions (Fleming 2000) and excess deaths (Fleming 2000; Simonsen 1997). It must also be considered in terms of increased days lost with absence from work and school, healthcare planning and influenza pandemic planning (Smith 2006).",

            "text": "High viral load and high viral infectiousness are likely to be the drivers of an influenza pandemic (Jefferson 2006a) and other serious epidemics such as with SARS. Other factors which contribute to influenza pandemics include an antigenic shift in the virus. An antigenic shift is a major change in the genetic makeup of the virus which creates a new subtype against which there is little circulating natural immunity (Smith 2006), as most people have not been exposed to this new virus and therefore are susceptible to infection. These pandemics were thought to originate in southern China, where ducks (the animal reservoir and breeding ground for new strains), pigs (which are thought to be the biological intermediate host or 'mixing vessel') and humans live in very close proximity (Bonn 1997). Pigs are considered plausible intermediate hosts as their respiratory epithelium cells have receptors for both avian (such as duck) and human viral hemagglutinins (Bonn 1997). Minor changes in viral antigenic configurations, known as 'drift', cause local or more circumscribed epidemics (Smith 2006).",

However a recent trial showed that handwashing may be effective in diminishing mortality for respiratory disease (Luby 2005). The possible effectiveness of public health measures during the 'Spanish Flu' pandemic of 1918 to 1919 (Bootsma 2007) in US cities led us to wonder what evidence exists on the effectiveness of combined public health measures such as isolation, distancing and barriers. We also considered the major social implications for any community adopting them (CDC 2005a; CDC 2005b; WHO 2006). Given the potential global importance of interrupting viral transmission, up\u2010to\u2010date, concise estimates of effectiveness are necessary to inform planning and decision making. We could find no previous systematic review of such evidence.",

One reported a reduced incidence of ARIs in the household over 26 weeks, from 14% to 5% (Farr 1988a). A similar study reported a small non\u2010significant (5%) drop across families (Farr 1988b). However, since the drop in incidence was confined to primary illness, unaffected by tissue use, we might assume they were ineffective. A community trial also reported a non\u2010significant reduction in ARI secondary attack rates (18.7% versus 11.8%) during a time of high circulation of influenza H3N2 and rhinoviruses in the community (Longini 1988). This result is likely to be an underestimate because of any barrier effect of the inert tissue wipes used in controls.",

Two of these trials reported a lack of effect: RR for the prevention of acute respiratory illness of 0.94 (95% CI \u20102.43 to 0.66) (Kotch 1994); and 0.97 (95% CI 0.72 to 1.30) (Sandora 2005). Nevertheless, the highest quality trials reported a significant decrease in respiratory illness in children up to 24 months (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.83 to 0.97), although the decrease was not significant in older children (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.01) (Roberts 2000); and a 50% (95% CI \u2010 65% to \u201034%) lower incidence of pneumonia in children aged less than five years of age in a developing country (Luby 2005). Another study reported a decrease of 30% to 38% in respiratory infections with additional hand\u2010rubbing (RR for illness absence incidence 0.69, RR for absence duration 0.71) (White 2001). One study reported decreased school absenteeism of 43% with the additional use of alcohol gel as well as handwashing (Morton 2004).

Randomisation could often have involved minimal disruption to service delivery. Inadequate reporting especially made interpretation difficult of before\u2010after studies. Incomplete or no reporting of: randomisation (Turner 2004a); blinding (Farr 1988a; \nFarr 1988b); numerators and denominators (Carabin 1999; Kotch 1994); interventions; outcomes (White 2003); participant attrition (Makris 2000); confidence intervals (Madge 1992); and cluster coefficients in the relevant trials (Carabin 1999) led to a considerable loss of information. Potential biases (such as cash incentives given to participants (White 2003)) were not discussed. Some authors even confused cohort with before\u2010after designs to elaborate conclusions unsupported by their data (Makris 2000). Methodological quality was sometimes eroded by the need to deliver behavioural interventions in the midst of service delivery (Niffenegger 1997).\nNonetheless, even when suboptimal designs were selected, trial authors rarely attempted to articulate potential confounders. A commonly ignored confounder, specific to this area, is the huge variability in viral incidence (Heymann 2004; Isaacs 1991). Sometimes this was addressed in the study design (Falsey 1999), even in controlled before\u2010and\u2010after studies (one attempted correlation between RSV admissions and RSV circulating in the community) (Krasinski 1990).

We found limited evidence of the superior effectiveness of droplet barrier devices such as the N95 masks over simple surgical masks. N95 masks are respirators with 95% filtration capability against non\u2010oily particulate aerosols (Teleman 2004). More expensive and uncomfortable (especially if worn for long periods) than simple surgical masks, they may be useful in very high risk situations.",

There is a clear requirement to carry out further large pragmatic trials to evaluate the best combinations. Randomised controlled trials with a pragmatic design, similar to the Luby et al trial, should be carried out whenever possible (Luby 2005). Nevertheless, this systematic review of the available research does provide some important insights. Perhaps the impressive effect of the hygienic measures aimed at younger children derives from the children's poor capability with their own hygiene. The variable quality and small scale of some studies is known from descriptive studies (Aiello 2002; Fung 2006; WHO 2006) and systematic reviews of selected interventions (Meadows 2004).",
