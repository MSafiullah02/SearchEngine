PEDV is an economically important cause of disease in pigs in Korea, resulting in significant morbidity and mortality in neonatal piglets and increased costs due to vaccination and disinfection (Chae et al., 2000, Jung et al., 2006a, Song et al., 2006). Although vaccines can be used to prevent PEDV, there are no effective strategies for treatment of affected pigs during PEDV outbreaks.",
