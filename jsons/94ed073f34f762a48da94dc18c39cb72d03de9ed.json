The 3a expression was detected in all three clones except in control (Fig. 1b, lanes 1-3) .

The loop regions could partially pair with the downstream sequences and form potential pseudoknot structures. To analyze the effects of these regions on the frameshifting efficiency, five deletion constructs, pEGFP3a 1 to 5, were made based on pEGFP-3a/7T (Fig. 4a) . In vitro translation of these deletion constructs (Fig. 4b) revealed the detection of both the termination products (EGFP) and the full length frameshifted products (FS). Compared to pEGFP-3a/7T, only 4 showed a slightly decreased detection of the FS product (Fig. 4b, lane 5) , while other deletions didn't have significant effect on the frameshifting efficiency. Similar expression profiles were observed in Cos-7 cells expressing the deletion constructs (Fig. 4c) .",

In the event of +1 frameshifting at the slippage site, the PhetRNA AAA could form perfect pair in the +1 frame with TTT. As mutation of any single T at the slippage site significantly impaired the frameshifting efficiency, it suggested that a double slippage mechanism is responsible for this frameshifting event and an exact base pairing is required for the efficient frameshifting. No other stimulators were found for this frameshifting event. This lack of additional stimulators was similar to the previous study with the Herpes simplex virus TK gene. 3 This may also explain why no frameshifting event was observed when imperfect base-pairing with the shifted frame was introduced.
