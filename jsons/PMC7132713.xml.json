Ten (1.3%), 7 (2.6%), 2 (1.2%), and 3 (3.7%) of exposed HCWs experienced TB seroconversion after the first, second, third, and fourth exposure, respectively. The overall rate of QFT-GIT conversion was calculated to be 1.14 cases per 100 exposure episodes per year. The rate of QFT-GIT conversion is calculated by using 22 QFT-GIT conversion divided by 1,281, multiplied by 100 and divided by the study duration of 1.5 years (study duration) to obtain 1.14 cases per 100 exposure episodes per year.",

            "text": "Age above 40 years, non-Chinese ethnicity, and foreign nationality were associated with baseline LTBI both in the bivariate analysis as well as in the multivariable analysis after adjusting for age, ethnicity, nationality, sex, and occupation. This could be due to foreign HCWs coming from countries with a higher prevalence of TB transmission. Although the incidence of TB in Singapore was 300 cases per 100,000 population in 1960, the incidence rate has declined to 47 per 100,000 by 2017, owing to an active TB control program. This rate is much lower than that of neighboring countries, including the Philippines, which has a TB incidence rate of 554 cases per 100,000 population.8 As such, foreign HCWs and HCWs of non-Chinese ethnicity above 40 years of age may be at increased risk of baseline LTBI unrelated to occupational TB exposure at work. TB screening of all exposed HCWs at baseline is therefore important to distinguish between baseline LTBI unrelated to work and work-related QFT-GIT conversion postexposure. HCWs with recent occupationally acquired LTBI are at higher risk of TB activation within the first 2 years.",

In comparison, TB contact tracing investigations in the United States found 23% with LTBI and 1% with active TB disease. This could be because of an overly cautious TB contact tracing protocol, which identifies someone as a TB contact if he or she has been exposed to an index TB case at the same location with shared air supply for >8 hours cumulatively. Moreover, the area dimensions of the locations covered for screening of potential TB contacts may have been too broad, involving those who may not have had close contact with the index TB patient. The TB contact tracing protocol also does not take into account the characteristics of the index patient, susceptibility and vulnerability of contacts, and circumstances of exposure, which have been used to assign priorities for contact investigations by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.15 This \u201cstone in the pond\u201d risk stratified approach to TB contact tracing has also been used in a tertiary care hospital in Singapore. As such, further studies are needed to better refine our contact tracing protocol through risk stratification based on exposure settings, as well as characteristics of the index patient and contacts.16\n",

In other words, the higher the likelihood of TB exposure and/or the poorer the infection control measures, the higher the risk of TB acquisition among exposed HCWs.

These measures should also be targeted toward HCWs in clinical disciplines more likely to be exposed to repeated TB exposures and at risk of developing LTBI such as internal medicine, medical subspecialties, and psychiatry with multibedded wards. Although HCWs in Singapore still routinely diagnose TB in patients, there could be delays in diagnosis and isolation. The delay in diagnosis could be due to (1) patients with negative AFB sputum smear but culture-positive pulmonary TB18; (2) pulmonary TB patients but atypical chest radiographic findings19; (3) difficulties in obtaining sputum specimen of sufficient quality for AFB smear20; (4) low awareness of TB among HCWs owing to decline in TB rates among local population following stricter TB infection control measures implemented since 199721; and (5) diverse manifestations of TB masquerading as other diseases.22 A systemic review found that mean health care system delay in diagnosis of TB in both inpatient and outpatient settings was 28.4 days in low-middle income countries and 21.5 days in high-income countries.23 Delays in isolation could be because of (1) resistance to isolation among patients and family members because of inconveniences and social isolation24; and (2) shortage of dedicated negative-pressure single-bedded rooms, which was exacerbated by a need to reserve standby single-bedded isolation rooms for emerging infectious diseases like avian influenza A and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus.25\n",

Also, given that Singapore is endemic for TB with an incidence rate of 47 per 100,000 in 2017, HCWs who experienced QFT-GIT conversion may have contracted TB outside of the health care setting and not attributable to his or her exposure to TB patients in the hospital.
