Differential diagnosis includes cerebral amoebiasis due to E. histolytica or other free living amoeba (e.g., Nigleria or Acanthamoeba spp.). Amoeba are identified on the basis of nuclear morphology and shape and size of the karyosome. E. histolytica has a distinctive large karyosome. Balamuthia and Acanthamoeba are sometimes difficult to differentiate, though Balamuthia sometimes has a double endosome (Fig. 15.36B ).

Adaptations for this life style include knuckle walking with the dorsal surface of phalanges 2 and 3 of digits 2-5 contacting the ground, necessitating specialize knuckle pads on the fingers, and a flatter backed posture in apes than monkeys. Both Pan species are considered \"highly frugivorous omnivores\" meaning that fruits, in addition to other plant parts, are major components of their diets. Gorillas are more strictly vegetarians, eating a wide variety of plant types and parts including grasses, leaves, stems/pith, bark, fruits and, occasionally, insects (Deblauwe and Janssens, 2008) . Western lowland gorillas are more strongly frugivorous than the Eastern gorillas; however, when Western gorillas and chimpanzees utilize the same forests, there is partitioning of resources such that chimpanzees are more frugivorous and gorillas rely more on herbaceous plants (Oelze et al, 2014) . Insectivory is well described in the African apes (Rothman et al., 2014) and consists primarily of consumption of termites and ants (Hamad et al., 2014) . Both bonobos and chimpanzees kill vertebrate prey including rodents and smaller nonhuman primates, and although providing a good source of high quality protein, this is a minor part of their diets (Moore et al., 2017; Sakamaki et al 2016; Tennie et al., 2014) .

The temporal lobes of the cerebral cortices are well developed and separated from the rest of the cerebral cortex by a deep Sylvian fissure (Sulcus lateralis), and the cerebral cortices contain many gyrations. The average brain mass of an adult chimpanzee is 381.7 \u00b1 37.2 g and that of a neonate 150.9 \u00b1 17 (DeSilva and Lesnik, 2006) .

Early knowledge of ape viruses relied on solely on serosurveys, detection of viruses via histopathology and ultrastructure, and/or virus isolation in cell culture (all of which are still useful in the molecular era) Soike et al., a,b, 1971 . A large number of virus have been identified, but many viruses went undetected or uncharacterized because they could not be grown in cell cultures. Modern sensitive techniques allow for detection of minute amounts of viral nucleic acid in samples, such as feces, urine, and saliva (Gillespe et al 2008; . Not only has this allowed identification of novel viruses, but it has also proved valuable for epidemiological studies. Caution must be exercised; however, because some of these sequences, especially those in feces, may be of prey item origin as chimpanzees and to a lesser extent in bonobos and orangutans are known to prey on other mammalian species including primates . The presence of viral nucleic acid also does not mean that the agent is causing disease. Virus discovery is often reported without accompanying clinical or anatomic pathological confirmation of associated lesions or location of virus replication. Likewise, seropositivity indicates exposure significant enough to cause seroconversion, but does not indicate ability of the agent to actually cause disease in the species. This means that the significance to ape health of many of the detected viruses remains uncertain.
