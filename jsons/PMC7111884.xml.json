Most IBVs infect the respiratory, urinary and reproductive tracts causing considerable production losses (Dolz et al, 2008, Jones, 2010, Roussan et al, 2008, Villarreal et al, 2007, Worthington et al, 2008). IBV infections can also be further aggravated by the presence of bacterial infections such as Escherichia coli, Mycoplasma gallisepticum, Mycoplasma synoviae and Ornithobacterium rhinotracheale (Landman, Feberwee, 2004, Matthijs et al, 2003, Naqi et al, 2001, van Empel et al, 1996).",

Virulent IBV genotypes (eg. 793/B, QX, IS/1494/06, IS/885/00, Q1) that have a severe impact on chicken health and production have been reported in recent decades (Gough et al, 1992, Kahya et al, 2013, Meir et al, 2004b, Yu et al, 2001). Infections from different IBV genotypes present a challenge for poultry producers worldwide (Dolz et al, 2008, Jones, 2010, Worthington et al, 2008), and also for owners of backyard chicken flocks. The spike subunit 1 (S1) is highly variable in IBV and analysis of S1 using reverse transcription\u2013polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and sequencing has allowed for genotyping of IBV strains (Kingham et al., 2000) .",

            "text": "Avian metapneumovirus (aMPV) is an avian virus belonging to the Paramyxoviridae family (Lee et al., 2007b). It is capable of infecting the respiratory tract of birds, causing avian rhinotracheitis in turkeys (Jones, 2010) and swollen head syndrome in chickens (Georgiades et al., 2001). Furthermore, it also causes a drop in egg production and/or egg quality in both turkeys and chickens (Banet-Noach et al, 2005, Hess et al, 2004). The virus was first reported in South Africa in the 1970s (Buys et al., 1989) and has since spread to other continents (Jones, 2010). There are four distinct aMPV subtypes; A, B, C and D (Cook and Cavanagh, 2002). Subtypes A and B are widespread throughout Asia, Europe, Africa and South America (Jones, 2010, Kwon et al, 2010, Owoade et al, 2008). Reports of infections by subtypes C and D are infrequent and to date, subtype C has been reported in France, Korea and the US (Alvarez et al, 2003, Bayon-Auboyer et al, 2000, Lee et al, 2007a), with D so far only detected in France (Bayon-Auboyer et al., 2000).",

This is despite Oman's geographic location (between the horn of Africa and southern Asia), its importance as a site for migrating wild birds and the presence of large commercial poultry production farms. These farms produce the majority of the Omani poultry requirements; however census data in 2004 reports there were around 25,000 backyard flocks bred for household consumption (Anon, 2004). Due to the avian influenza contingency plan implemented between 2004 and 2012, this number has been reduced to nearly 10,000 flocks (Rural Women Development Department, personal communication, 2012). Maintaining a good health status of backyard flocks is crucial for both the flock owners and the owners of nearby commercial flocks (McBride et al., 1991).

More than one flock was sampled if the farm had more than one species of bird. The samples were collected during a study on the prevalence of respiratory viruses, such as avian influenza (AI), Newcastle disease (ND), IB and aMPV. The number and location of sampled farms was determined based on the estimated prevalence of Avian Influenza (AI) and Newcastle Disease (ND) in Oman backyard poultry. Sampling criteria were calculated based on an estimated prevalence of AI of 30% and between-cluster variance of 0.7. The number of flocks to be sampled was stratified by region according to the number of poultry farms, total number of poultry, number of people and number of backyard poultry present in each region. A confidence level of 95% was utilised along with a two-stage cluster sampling method (Thrusfield, 1986).",

The presence of 793/B in commercial flocks has previously been reported in other Middle East countries such as Iran, Jordan and Israel (Meir et al, 2004b, Roussan et al, 2008, Seyfi Abad Shapouri et al, 2004). In the last few years, 793/B vaccines and strains closely-related to 793/B, have been detected in the Omani commercial chicken (K. Ganapathy, unpublished data, 2010). The 793/B isolates detected within the backyard flocks formed a close phylogenetic cluster, indicating that potentially the same 793/B strain may be circulating between different Omani backyard flocks and regions. Oman-Lewa-4\u201312 was distinct from other 793/B-type isolates, with only 92% identity with the vaccine strain, which shows that it could be a virulent 793/B virus circulating in this flock.",

In the current study, we detected M41-like and D274-like infections within four chicken flocks at a low prevalence of 0.82% each. Both genotypes have been previously reported in commercial flocks in the Middle East (Roussan et al, 2008, Seyfi Abad Shapouri et al, 2004, Sjaak de Wit et al, 2011), albeit at a much higher prevalence than witnessed during this study.

This presence suggests that common circulating IBV genotypes (such as 793/B) could potentially establish an infection in both ducks and turkeys. Using RT-PCR, IBV has previously been detected in apparently healthy ducks in China and Nigeria (Feng et al, 2012, Semeka et al, 2013). Despite previous reports having identified a turkey coronavirus closely related to IBV (Breslin et al, 1999, Cavanagh et al, 2001), to date there has been only one report of IBV infecting turkeys (Semeka et al., 2013). To our knowledge, this appears to be the first report of an IBV-like detection in both duck and turkey flocks in the Middle East.",

With its involvement in respiratory and reproductive disorders (Georgiades et al, 2001, Jones, 2010), the circulation of this pathogen is likely to pose a threat to backyard and commercial poultry in Oman.
