Evidence shows that children are less active and more sedentary, with less consistent sleep patterns, on unstructured or non-school days (ie, when they are not physically at school) than on school days.1\nCommunity mobility data from Google across the 15 countries represented by our authorship show that\u2014compared with the week ending Feb 23, 2020, before the WHO pandemic announcement\u2014time spent in places associated with physical activity such as parks, beaches, and community gardens was down by 31%, and travel by public transport, which is also associated with physical activity, was down by 59% during the week ending April 5, 2020, after a pandemic was declared. Conversely, time spent in places of residence increased by an average of 17%. Compared with before the COVID-19 crisis, Canadians aged 15\u201349 years reported a 66% increase in time watching TV and 35% increase in time spent playing video games between March 29 and April 3, 2020. Interviews done with 15 parents of preschool children in Beijing, China, found that, compared with pre-COVID-19, nearly all children were going to bed later and waking up later. Sedentary screen time had increased and physical activity levels were very low, with children not being allowed outdoors (unpublished data). In South Korea, we surveyed 97 parents of young children between March 27 and 31, 2020; 79 (81%) reported that their children's screen time had increased and 46 (94%) of 49 reported that their children's use of play and sports facilities had decreased.",

First, data from the pre-COVID-19 period show that, on average, only a fifth of preschoolers and less than 10% of school-aged children meet all the movement guidelines.2 Given the strong associations of health outcomes with movement behaviours,3, 4 children's health will be even more compromised during COVID-19. Second, this period of home confinement\u2014especially if indoors and in small spaces\u2014could lead to higher risk of vitamin D deficiency5, mental health issues,6 and myopia.7 Third, although children seem less susceptible to COVID-19, maintaining or increasing levels of physical activity can reduce their risk of respiratory infections.8 Fourth, benefits that help children to cope with life-changing circumstances, such as the role of physical activity in resilience building, might be compromised. Fifth, the interactive effects of each movement behaviour might be more pronounced\u2014eg, children who are less active and engaged in more screen time are likely to have poorer sleep. Finally, there could be potential longer-term health and economic consequences if the adverse behavioural adaptations, such as less activity, become the new normal.9\n",

These groups tend to accumulate physical activity through outdoor play and active commuting to school, which is threatened by an increase in time indoors.10 Poorer neighbourhood safety\u2014especially in countries where schools might be the only safe play space in the neighbourhood\u2014make it harder for children to be active when schools are closed.

We acknowledge that many parents are juggling reduced income, food insecurity, and working from home while supervising their children's daily schooling, so movement behaviours might not be a priority. However, we believe that the pandemic provides an opportunity to raise awareness of movement behaviour guidelines for chIldren and to promote their uptake across all areas of society.PanelRecommendations for promoting healthy movement behaviour\n\u2022Parents and carers should incorporate physical activity into children's daily routine (including using electronic media to facilitate participation) and encourage the whole family to join while adhering to regulations on physical distancing and access to outdoor spaces. Extended periods of sitting should be broken up every 30\u201360 min (eg, by standing and stretching for 1 min). They should follow sedentary recreational screen-time recommendations and encourage co-viewing and positive social interactions and experiences. To help children to get enough sleep, keep bed and wake times consistent, keep screens out of the room where children sleep, and avoid screen use before bedtime.\u2022Educators and teachers should know and promote the movement behaviour guidelines, and embrace opportunities to incorporate healthy movement messages, practices, and policies into daily home-school routines and lessons\u2014eg, when scheduling online lessons, limit prolonged sitting and encourage changes in posture such as regularly standing, stretching, or moving on the spot.\u2022Health professionals should understand and recommend the current guidelines to parents, family members, and caregivers and reinforce their positive association with children's health during all visits, including remote contacts and telemedicine.\u2022Governments should promote healthy movement behaviours in children as part of response strategies and public messaging, and should engage influential people in promotion of such messages.\u2022The media should provide regular messages to promote physical activity and break up extended periods of sitting.\u2022Children should speak up and advocate for their right to a healthy, active life, while carefully observing pandemic restrictions. Forming peer groups can help with maintaining healthy movement behaviour patterns.\n",
