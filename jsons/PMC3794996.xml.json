            "text": "Influenza viruses originating from animals caused the three major influenza pandemics of the previous century. Swine were a gateway for avian influenza virus genes to enter human populations as reassortant viruses and also initiated the influenza (H1N1) pandemic of 2009 [1]. The recent discovery of novel influenza A viruses in Guatemalan yellow-shouldered fruit bats identified another mammalian species that may serve as an important source of influenza virus genetic diversity and support reassortment with human influenza viruses [2]. Bats are a major source of emerging infectious diseases, including coronaviruses, filoviruses, henipaviruses, and lyssaviruses [3]\u2013[5]. Their global distribution, abundance, diversity (\u223c1200 species) and high population densities underscore the need to better understand the ecology and properties of influenza viruses that infect this mammalian order, as well as the potential of viral jumps across species barriers to emerge in new hosts [5]. These considerations prompted additional searches for species harboring novel influenza A viruses within the Americas, and detailed characterization of the virus-host interactions at the molecular and atomic levels.",

The sampled bats comprised 18 species, although 12 species were represented by four or fewer animals (Table 1). Initial screening of the available 110 rectal swabs with a pan Flu RT-PCR assay identified a flat-faced fruit bat (ID PEBT033) (Artibeus planirostris) from Truenococha as positive for influenza virus. Of the other available specimens, i.e. liver, intestine and spleen tissues from bat PEBT033, the intestine tissue specimen was strong positive whereas others were negative. A BLAST search based on the 250 nt sequence of the PB1 RT-PCR amplicon showed that the influenza gene in the PEBT033 bat was most closely related (77% nt identity) to the PB1 genes of recently described bat influenza viruses, e.g. A/little yellow-shouldered bat/Guatemala/164/2009 (H17N10). The RNA from bat PEBT033 rectal swab sample was analyzed by Sanger and deep sequencing as described previously [2] to generate a full-length genomic sequence (GenBank accession numbers CY125942-CY125949), and this virus was designated A/flat-faced bat/Peru/033/2010 (A/bat/Peru/10) (Table S1).",

With the notable exception of the HA, the bat virus genes (i) fell as an outgroup to all other known influenza A viruses, and (ii) in four gene segments (PB2, PB1, PA and NA) harbored more genetic diversity than those present in all non-bat (i.e. avian, mammalian) groups combined [2]. Considering the limited geographic area and bat species numbers sampled in the Americas, the remarkable divergence between A/bat/Peru/10 and Guatemalan bat viruses in these four gene segments suggests that New World bat species may carry a diverse pool of influenza viruses. In contrast, the bat HA gene sequences represented a distinct lineage within the known diversity of this gene [2].",

To evaluate transcription and replication functions of the A/bat/Peru/10 polymerase complex proteins 4P (PB2, PB1, PA, and NP), we used a minigenome reporter replicon system coupled to transient expression by transfected DNA [10]. In this assay, a mini-genome reporter plasmid, in which luciferase expression is driven by non-coding regions (NCR) from bat (Guat/164.NS-NCR) or human (WSN.NS-NCR) influenza virus, showed high levels of viral transcription when co-transfected with a complete polymerase complex 4P from bat viruses, as compared to control with a plasmid set lacking the PB1 protein (Guat/164-3P) (Fig. S2). The activity of A/bat/Peru/10 RNP complex (Peru/033-4P) with the bat influenza minigenome was 5-fold lower than that of A/bat/Guat/09 (Guat/164-4P), but similar to that of the human (WSN-4P) influenza virus. In contrast, the Peru/033-4P was 16-fold less active than Guat/164-4P with the WSN.NS-NCR (Fig. S2) indicating a possible host restriction for the Peru/033-4P to function efficiently with human influenza genome segments. However, previous reports have shown that differences of this magnitude could be determined by a single amino-acid substitution in one of the polymerase proteins [11], [12].",

            "text": "We determined crystal structures of the A/bat/Peru/10 HA and NAL proteins expressed in a baculovirus system. Two highly similar crystal structures of the A/bat/Peru/10 HA ectodomain were independently determined to 2.15 and 2.24 \u00c5 resolution (Table S6) (C\u03b1 r.m.s.d. of 0.25 \u00c5 and 0.34 \u00c5 between equivalent monomers and trimers). The overall H18 HA trimer is similar to other HA structures with a membrane-distal globular head comprising the RBS and the vestigial esterase domain, and a membrane-proximal stem region containing the putative monobasic HA1/HA2 cleavage site and fusion peptide (Fig. 2A, Fig. S3, and Tables S3 and S7). The H18 HA ectodomain was expressed in the HA0 form [13]. Tryptic digestion of HA0 at pH 8.0 resulted in specific cleavage to HA1/HA2 (Fig. 3), suggesting A/bat/Peru/10 HA also requires processing to be functional for infection. Surprisingly, however, trypsin digestion at pH 4.9 did not degrade HA1 and HA2 (Fig. 3) in contrast to other HAs that adopt a fusion active form on exposure to pH\u22645.5 exposing trypsin cleavage sites and degradation in this assay. Thus, although the fusion peptide, coiled-coil heptad repeats, HA2 Arg106, and the stem region in general are largely conserved, the requirements for the pH-induced conformational change that occurs upon activation of membrane fusion appear to be different [14], [15]. The membrane-distal domain mediates receptor binding and contains most of the epitopes recognized by antibodies. The HAs from influenza viruses are well documented to bind to glycan receptors with terminal sialic acid. The RBS in influenza A contains several highly conserved amino acids at its base: Tyr98, Trp153, His183, and Tyr195 (H3 numbering, Tables S3 and S8), and three major structural elements at its edge: 130-loop (134\u2013138), 220-loop (221\u2013228), and 190-helix (188\u2013194) [16], [17]. In all HAs examined to date, sialic acid binds through hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonds with HA residues from the 130- and 220-loops and 190-helix (Fig. S3C) as well as the base [18]. In contrast, H18 HA has a dramatic alteration of the binding site residues (Fig. 2B, Tables S3 and S8) where only three (Trp153, His183, and Tyr195) of the key RBS residues in influenza A viruses [16], [19] are conserved (Fig. 2B, Table S8), although Glu190 and Gly225 represent consensus sequences in avian HAs. Tyr98 that hydrogen bonds to the 8-hydroxyl group of sialic acid in influenza A viruses, is replaced in H18 by Phe98 (Table S8). Significantly, Leu194 in influenza A and B viruses, another critical residue for sialic acid binding [20], is replaced by Tyr194 in H18 (Table S8). Together with other larger residues, including Asp136, Gln155, and Asp228, which are unique to H18 and H17 HA bat proteins (Tables S3 and S8), the addition of Tyr194 dramatically flattens and widens the RBS as compared to pandemic 2009 H1 (Fig. 2C) and other HAs (Fig. S4). The glycerol side chain of a canonical sialic acid would clash with Tyr194 and Asp228 (Fig. 2C). In addition, Asp136, which is not found in H1\u2013H16, would electrostatically repulse the sialic acid carboxylate. Several assays were used to investigate the binding of the H18 HA to mammalian glycans. H18 HA exhibited no specific binding to a custom sialoside microarray (data not shown) [9], [21] or the glycan microarray of the Consortium for Functional Glycomics (CFG) that contains 610 diverse glycans found on mammalian cells, including over 100 unique sialosides (\u03b12-3, \u03b12-6,, \u03b12-8, and mixed linkages) (Fig. S5A and Tables S9, S10) [22]. In contrast, the influenza H5 HA bound robustly to numerous sialosides on the array (Fig. S5C). The lack of binding to sialosides was further confirmed in a plate-based ELISA with glycans 3\u2032-SLNLN and 6\u2032-SLNLN (Fig. S5D\u2013E) showing no detectable binding to either sialoside, in contrast to H5 HA. These data strongly suggest that bat H18 HA does not recognize sialic acid receptors, and its receptor remains to be defined.",

            "text": "The extensive sequence divergence of A/bat/Peru/10 NAL from the recently characterized N10 prompted us to determine its X-ray structure in two crystal forms at 2.68 \u00c5 and 3.0 \u00c5 (Fig. S6A, Table S6). The N11 NAL forms a typical \u201cbox-shaped\u201d tetramer, containing six four-stranded, antiparallel \u03b2-sheets in a propeller-like arrangement (Fig. 4A). Comparison of the A/bat/Peru/10 NAL monomer with other NA structures reveals surprising similarity despite low sequence identity (29.6%) (Fig. S6B\u2013D and Table S4). In addition, a calcium required for stabilization of all known influenza A and B NA active sites [23], [24] is conserved in N11 NAL (Fig. 4A). Taken together, the N11 NAL and the N10 NAL [9] are homologous proteins characterized by highly diverged putative active sites (Fig. 4B). Among the eight conserved charged and polar residues that interact with substrate in all other influenza A and B subtypes [25], only Arg118, Arg224, Glu276 are conserved (N2 numbering, Fig. 4B, Tables S5 and S11) as in N10 NALs [9]. Arg292 and Arg371, critical for sialic acid binding, are replaced in A/bat/Peru/10 NAL by Thr and Lys, respectively. Furthermore, only three of eleven second-shell residues are conserved in N11 NAL (Trp178, Ser179 and Glu425) (Fig. 4B, Tables S5 and S11). The N11 NAL active site pocket is much wider than other flu A and B NAs, including 1918 N1, due mainly to 150- and 430-loop movements (Fig. 4C) [26]. The glycerol moiety of a canonical sialic acid, as observed in other flu A and B NA structures [26], would clash with the N11 NAL active site (Fig. 4C). In comparison with bat N10 NAL [9], eight residues are conserved in the putative active site (Fig. 4B, Table S11). N11 NAL catalyzes extremely low levels of sialic acid cleavage (Fig. S7) [22] as observed for N10 NAL [9], and similar to H18 HA, N11 NAL exhibited no binding to 610 diverse natural glycans including sialosides in a glycan microarray assay (Fig. S5B and Tables S9, S10). Thus, neither H18 HA nor N11 NAL appears to bind sialic acids, suggesting they interact with receptors that have still to be identified to retain their function of mediating entry and release of bat H18N11 viruses.",

Specific IgG antibody titers to bat rHA or rNAL (>1\u22361,000) were detected among 55 of 110 bats from Peru (Table 1). High titers (\u22651\u223616,000) to rHA or rNAL were detected in 11 sera (10%). A high proportion of these 55 bat sera (21 samples) were positive for both rHA and rNAL, whereas 30 were positive for rHA only and 4 positive for rNAL only. A selection of H18 positive sera were also tested against H17, H1 and H5 (rHAs), and no cross reactivity was detected, in agreement with the proposed H18 subtype designation (Fig. S8). If the immunodominance of HA in humans and swine is recapitulated in bats, the absence of antibodies to HA in NAL-seropositive animals suggests that bat viruses of an unknown HA subtype, in combination with N11, may have infected these animals [27]. The proportion of seropositive samples was highest among Artibeus in Truenococha (25 of 28 tested, positive for rHA or rNA). Five additional bat species also appear to be highly seropositive despite small sample sizes (Table 1).",

Hence, these data suggest that bat influenza HA and/or NAL mediate host cell entry and release via different receptors compared to other influenza viruses. More generally, these discoveries highlight the functional plasticity of influenza A viruses. In addition, attempts to propagate this virus in mammalian and avian cell cultures have been unsuccessful, although viral transcription from reporter minigenomes is functional in human and primate cells. This complicates the development of animal models to investigate the host range and virulence of bat influenza viruses. Taken together, these obstacles create significant gaps in our knowledge for assessing the potential public health significance of these viruses. Until these problems are resolved, serologic studies in human populations that may come in contact with bats in Central or South America that potentially harbor H17N10 and H18N11 influenza viruses may help inform risk assessment efforts.",

All contigs with a coverage depth \u22653X where submitted to BLASTn against the non-redundant (nr) NCBI database to identify influenza sequences. This process was repeated with tBLASTx to find segments that were not identified from nucleotide BLASTn. To increase the reliability of the sequence data from Illumina sequencing, the rectal swab of bat PEBT033 was also processed by Sanger sequencing on RT-PCR amplicons of genome segment.

The three highly conserved residues (W153, H183, and Y195) in HAs are colored with green carbon atoms, whereas nine residues that are conserved in A/bat/Peru/10 H18 and two H17 HAs from bat influenza viruses A/little yellow-shouldered bat/Guatemala/164/2009 (H17N10) (GU09-164) and A/little yellow-shouldered bat/Guatemala/060/2010 (H17N10) (GU10-060) are labeled in red. E190 and G225 are also conserved, especially in avian influenza A viruses. (C) Molecular surface of the putative RBS of A/bat/Peru/10 HA compared to the RBS of 2009 H1 HA from A/California/04/2009 (H1N1) (PDB code 3UBQ). A canonical sialic acid is modeled in the HA for comparison as observed in other HA structures. The RBS of A/bat/Peru/10 HA is shallower and wider than 2009 H1 HA with no space for the glycerol moiety of sialic acid (indicated by the red arrow). For comparison, figures (B) and (C) are generated in the same orientation.",

The N11 NAL tetramer is viewed from above the viral surface, and consists of four identical monomers with C4 symmetry. One monomer is colored in six different colors to illustrate the canonical \u03b2-propeller shape of six four-stranded, anti-parallel \u03b2-sheets. The putative active site is located on the membrane-distal surface (on top of the molecule). The observed N-linked glycosylation sites are shown with attached carbohydrates. A single calcium ion is shown in red spheres. (B) The A/bat/Peru/10 NAL putative active site (crystal form 1, Table S6) with the conserved catalytic and active site residues in other NAs shown as well as other polar and charged residues. The six residues (R118, W178, S179, R224, E276 and E425) conserved in all influenza NAs are colored with green carbon atoms in contrast to other putative active site residues in yellow carbon atoms, whereas eight residues that are conserved in two bat influenza N10 and N11 NAL proteins are labeled in red. (C) Molecular surface of the active site of A/bat/Peru/10 N11 NAL and 1918 N1 NA from A/Brevig Mission/1/18 (H1N1) (PDB code 3BEQ). A canonical sialic acid is modeled in A/bat/Peru/10 NAL as in other NA structures and appears to collide with the NA putative active site around the glycerol moiety (as indicated by the red arrow).
