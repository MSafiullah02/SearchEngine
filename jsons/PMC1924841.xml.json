The location of these loops is such that they position the electropositive residues at the entrance of the catalytic clefts containing the HIT-like motif. Due to the close proximity of the grooves and clefts, binding of ssRNA in a groove may impact the passage of NTPs into or out of the cleft and, therefore, may influence the NTPase activity of the octamer. On the other hand, interaction of ssRNA with a groove may promote entry of the triphosphorylated 5\u2032 end of the bound RNA into the cleft, an event that may be further advanced by the strongly electropositive characteristics of the cleft residues. Given that the interior dimensions of the cleft are sufficient to accommodate ssRNA,14 we investigated the possibility that the NSP2 octamer could function as an RNA triphosphatase (RTPase), wherein those same residues involved in NTP hydrolysis would direct the cleavage of the \u03b3-\u03b2 phosphoanhydride bond at the 5\u2032 end of a ssRNA.",

Overall, the results suggest that ssRNAs represent a legitimate substrate for the hydrolytic activity of NSP2 during the rotavirus replication cycle. This activity may account for the absence of the \u03b3P at the 5\u2032 end of the (\u2212) strands that make up the rotavirus dsRNA genome.

To explore the possibility that this architecture would allow NSP2 to function as an RTPase (Figure 2(a)), we prepared [\u03b3-32P]5\u2032g8 RNA, a probe representing the first 21 residues of the rotavirus gene 8 RNA radiolabeled only at the \u03b3P position (Figure 2(b)). The RNA was incubated with octamers of wild-type NSP2 (wtNSP2) and of an NSP2 mutant that lacks NTPase activity due to mutation of the catalytic H225 residue (H225A), under reaction conditions used earlier for NTPase assays.18 As shown by thin-layer chromatography (TLC) of the reaction products (Figure 2(c)), wtNSP2 but not H225A, catalyzed the hydrolysis of the \u03b3P from the ssRNA. Like the NTPase activity of NSP2, hydrolysis of the \u03b3P from RNA was dependent on Mg2+ in reaction mixtures (data not shown). These results are consistent with NSP2 functioning as an RTPase, potentially utilizing the same residues in the cleft needed for NTP hydrolysis (e.g. H225).",

To examine this possibility further, we performed competition experiments that measured how the addition of GTP, GDP, or GMP to reaction mixtures containing wtNSP2 and [\u03b3-32P]5\u2032g8 RNA affected RTPase activity. The results showed that at high molar ratios of GTP to the RNA substrate, GTP successfully inhibited RTPase activity in a concentration dependent manner (Figure 6\n). The fact that a 50% reduction in 32Pi formation required a ratio of RNA to GTP of 1:2500\u20133000 may reflect, in part, the higher affinity of NSP2 for the RNA substrate of its RTPase activity as compared to the affinity of NSP2 for the NTP substrate of its NTPase activity. Competition assays performed with GDP showed that this nucleotide was approximately one-third as effective in reducing 32Pi formation as GTP, producing a 50% reduction in RTPase activity at a ratio of RNA to GDP of \u223c1:6000. In contrast to GTP and GDP, GMP had little or no effect on the RTPase activity even at very high concentrations. These results indicate that GTP, and to a lesser extent GDP, compete with ssRNA as substrates for hydrolysis, supporting the concept that a common active site directs both the RTPase and NTPase activities of NSP2. The fact that a high concentration of nucleotide relative to RNA is required to reduce RTPase levels supports the concept that RNA is the preferred substrate of NSP2.",

This structural arrangement raises the possibility that binding of RNA to the groove, enhances the RTPase activity of the octamer by recruiting the substrate for the reaction to a position near the catalytic site. In order to test this possibility, two mutant species of the NSP2 octamer were prepared, in which either three (mt3Q (Lys59, Arg60, Arg68)) or six (mt6Q (Lys37, Lys38, Lys58, Lys59, Arg60, Arg68)) conserved and solvent-exposed electropositive residues along the grooves and proximal to the catalytic clefts were replaced with glutamine, a polar non-charged amino acid (Figures 1(d) and 7(a)).

In particular, glutamine mutagenesis of the three residues Lys59, Arg60, and Arg68 caused a five- to tenfold decrease in activity.

The remainder of the RNA was oriented such that its 3\u2032 end extended from the cleft. One representative position was selected and subjected for molecular dynamics simulation using CHARMM to define possible interactions formed between the protein and the ligand. The results suggested that several electropositive residues in the RNA-binding loop interacted with the 5-mer RNA, including residues shown above to be important in the RNA-binding and RTPase activities of NSP2 (Figure 8(a)). Analysis of the RNA\u2013protein complexes after simulation indicated a web of interactions (mainly hydrogen bonds) between Lys59, Arg60, and Arg68 and the oxygen moieties present at positions three and four of the RNA molecule backbone (third and fourth nucleoside) (Figure 8(b)). The simulation also indicated that Lys37 interacted with the fifth position of the RNA (last nucleoside). The simulation failed to suggest any interaction between Lys38 and Lys58 and the RNA. A remarkable suggestion of the simulation was the interaction of the 5\u2032-terminal triphosphate group of the RNA with the catalytic residue His225 and other residues involved in the NTPase activity (Figure 8(c)).18 In summary, the results obtained by the RNA simulation suggest that several of the basic residues selected for charge-deletion mutation in mt3Q and mt6Q may have an effect on directing and stabilizing the 5\u2032 end of RNA in the cleft such that its terminal phosphate bond is appropriately oriented for nucleophilic attack.",

To examine this possibility, full-length NSP5 with an N-terminal His tag was expressed in bacteria and purified by Ni2+-affinity chromatography.

Immunofluorescence analysis of these cells using NSP2 and NSP5-specific antisera revealed that the charge-deletion mutations in mtQ3 had only a partial effect on the ability of the protein to support the formation of VLSs (Figure 10\n). In particular, while mt3Q supported VLS formation, these inclusions were generally smaller than those formed with wtNSP2, and there was a conspicuous increase in the amount of NSP2 and NSP5 distributed throughout the cytosol, that failed to localize to viroplasms. In contrast, the mutations in mtQ6 prevented this protein from supporting the formation of VLSs. Instead of localizing to inclusions, mtQ6 and NSP5 were distributed throughout the cytosol in a manner that was only partially overlapping, with mt6Q having a somewhat granular appearance. Thus, in addition to the importance of the electropositive residues adjacent to the groove in the RTPase and RNA-binding activities of NSP2, these residues have critical function in the formation of viroplasms. Most likely, the charge-deletion mutations of mt3Q and mt6Q altered the surface charge of NSP2 in such a way that the protein could no longer interact appropriately with NSP5 to support viroplasm formation. Alternatively, the charge-deletion mutations prevented NSP2 from binding RNA, and therefore prevented the RNA-mediated bridging of NSP2 and NSP5 that may have a role in viroplasm formation. The failure of viroplasms to form with the mt3Q and mt6Q species is not due to their failure to efficiently hydrolyze the \u03b3\u2013\u03b2 phosphoanhydride bond of RNA, since previous studies showed that the NTPase and RTPase-defective mutant H225A supported the formation of viroplasms as efficiently as wtNSP2.18\n",

This activity is indistinguishable from that of the NTPase activity of NSP2, both representing metal-dependent hydrolysis reactions with similar V\nmax values that require the H225 residue and that produce a phosphorylated enzyme intermediate and free Pi. These results and those of competition assays indicate that hydrolysis of the RNA and NTP substrates occur at a common active site, located within a deep electropositive cleft of each NSP2 monomer. The cleft includes features characteristic of HIT proteins including a fold that is similar to one present in the catalytic core of PKCI and a HIT-like active site. Although NSP2 can remove the \u03b3P from either RNA or NTP, RNA represents the preferred substrate due to the higher affinity (K\nm) of the octamer for this molecule. In comparison to other known viral RTPases, the K\nm value indicates that the NSP2 octamer has a remarkably strong affinity for its RNA substrate (Table 1), suggesting that this represents a legitimate catalytic activity of the protein during the viral life cycle.",

One possibility is that soon after (\u2212)-strand initiation, the nascent RNA product interacts with NSP2 in such a way that its 5\u2032 end enters into one of the clefts of an octamer, where it engages the active site. This interaction may anchor the nascent (\u2212) strand as the RdRP carries out elongation. As the RdRP nears completion of the (\u2212) strand, the affinity of the RdRP and NSP2 for each other, combined with the interaction of NSP2 with the 5\u2032 end of the (\u2212) strand, and the interaction of the RdRP with the 3\u2032 end of the (\u2212) strand may generate a complex in which the dsRNA product is circularized. Interestingly, the high efficiency of transcription by DLPs has led to the suggestion that the dsRNAs are circularized within the capsid, an organization allowing the polymerase to move expeditiously from the 5\u2032 to the 3\u2032 end of the (\u2212)-strand template following rounds of (+)-strand synthesis.25\n,\n26 The NSP2\u2013RdRP -mediated bridging of the ends of the dsRNA product may be responsible for initially establishing the circularized form of the genome segments.",

Despite such interactions, our in vitro assays indicate that NSP2 cannot use methylated capped (+)-strand RNAs as substrates for hydrolysis. Interestingly, one of the well-characterized HIT-family proteins, DcpS, possesses a 7-methyl guanosine specific hydrolase activity that is responsible for mRNA decapping during exosome-mediated decay.27 The failure of NSP2 to utilize a methylated capped RNA as a substrate for hydrolysis despite sharing a HIT-like motif and a HIT-like fold similar to those of DcpS, may have multiple explanations. Perhaps most importantly is the observation that in the HIT site of DcpS, side-chain interactions are established that mediate the specific recognition of methylated guanosine residue of the cap structure, and as consequence, the engagement of the phosphate residues of the cap structure with the catalytic residues of the active site.28 It should also be noted that DcpS, like other HIT proteins, exists as an asymmetric dimer when bound to a cap, a conformation that leaves its catalytic cleft in a structurally open and solvent accessible form.28 In contrast, NSP2 is an octamer with a 4-2-2 symmetry, in which substrate binding and hydrolysis occur within the deep clefts that divide each monomer. In contrast to the openness of the HIT site of DcpS, the constrained accessibility and rigidity of the deep clefts in the NSP2 octamer may restrict capped RNAs from gaining entry to the HIT site. It is also possible that the NSP2 cleft may not have appropriate dimensions to spatially accommodate the inverted guanosine of the cap in such a way that the triphosphate linkage can engage the catalytic residues needed for nucleophilic attack. The lack of a common substrate between proteins in the large HIT superfamily despite shared catalytic HIT motif and a C-terminal HIT fold in their structures has been reported.20\n",

Although mtQ6 is defective in RTPase activity, and to a lesser extent in NTPase activity, it is unlikely that these deficiencies contributed to the defect in VLSs formation, given the results of an earlier study showing that the catalytically inactive NSP2 mutant H225A supported inclusion formation.18 Instead, it is more likely that mtQ6 failed to support VLSs formation because of the loss of critical electropositive charges needed to support its stable interaction with the acidic protein NSP5 or with ssRNA, or a combination of the two.

Metal-dependent RTPases have been described for metazoan DNA viruses (e.g. Poxvirus, Chlorella virus), fungi, and protozoan parasites.33\n,\n34 These RTPases are known to remove the \u03b3P from not only RNAs, but also NTPs, via hydrolysis reactions taking place at a common active site. The X-ray structure of the Sacharomyces cerevisiae Cet 1 RTPase suggests that the active site of the fungal and Chlorella virus enzymes is contained in an open hydrophilic tunnel formed by eight antiparallel \u03b2-strands, in which two conserved glutamates residues are critical for hydrolysis of the \u03b3-\u03b2 phosphate bond.34\n,\n35 Metal-independent RTPases have been identified in mammals and other metazoan organisms. Characteristically, these RTPases undergo phosphorylation during the hydrolysis reaction due to the transfer of the \u03b3P to a residue at the active site (e.g. phosphotyrosine). These RTPases are usually incapable of using NTPs as substrates.36 The recently solved structures of mouse Mce1 and Baculovirus BVP RTPases suggests the existence of another class of RTPases, wherein the active site is located at the bottom of a deep positively charged pocket containing a conserved cysteine residue that acts as the catalytic amino acid.37\n,\n38 Several other enzymes with dual RTPase and NTPase activities have been identified, including some belonging to RNA virus families (e.g. NS3 of dengue virus, NS13 of coronavirus, Nsp2 of alphavirus).39., 40., 41., 42. The relationship of these dual functioning enzymes, if any, to previously described RTPases is uncertain, in part due to the lack of sufficient biochemical and structural information.",

Other viruses belonging to the Reoviridae family encode non-structural proteins with characteristics similar to that of NSP2, including the well-studied NS2 protein of bluetongue virus (BTV) and \u03c3NS protein of orthoreovirus.43 Like the NSP2 protein, NS2 and \u03c3NS self-assemble into homomultimeric complexes with associated ssRNA-binding and helix-unwinding activities and are components of viral replication intermediates.43., 44., 45. Furthermore, both NS2 and \u03c3NS participate in viroplasm formation in BTV- and reovirus-infected cells, respectively. In contrast to the RTPase/NTPase activity of rotavirus NSP2, BTV NS2 has an associated phosphatase activity, allowing it to remove all three phosphates from an NTP. Unlike NSP2 and NS2, \u03c3NS has no known enzymatic activity. However, during assembly of viroplasms in reovirus-infected cells, \u03c3NS interacts with \u03bc2, a non-structural protein with RTPase/NTPase activity.46 Thus, a common feature of Reoviridae viroplasms appears to be the presence of non-structural proteins with catalytic activity capable of hydrolyzing phosphate groups from NTPs, and in at least some cases, from the 5\u2032 end of ssRNAs. Despite their related activity, only rotavirus NSP2 is known to contain a HIT-like fold and motif, and hence its mechanism of hydrolytic attack can be expected to unlike that of NS2 and \u03c3NS.",

The size of the RNA selected for simulation was based on the limitation in the number of rotatable bonds imposed by the docking program. The Mg2+ was positioned in the cleft using distance restraint between the geometric center of the atoms OH of Tyr171 and OE2 of Glu153, followed by energy-minimization. This location is based on the position proposed for Mg2+ from the crystallographic data.14 Representations of the NSP2 structure and 5-mer RNA were prepared using Insight II.49 The hydrogen atoms of the protein and the RNA molecule were assigned by CHARMM (version 27).50 Partial charges were assigned using the CHARMM27 Force Field. Atomic solvation parameters and fragmental volumes were assigned to the protein using the Addsol program. The grid maps were calculated using Autogrid and were centered on the ligand-binding site (NSP2 cleft).
