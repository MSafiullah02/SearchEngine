Their small size makes them ultrafilterable, i.e. they are not retained by bacteria-proof filters. Viruses have evolved over longtime period, and have adapted to specific organisms or their cells. The infectious virus particles, or virions, are composed of proteins and are surrounded in some species of viruses by a lipid membrane, which is referred to as an envelope; the particles contain only one kind of nucleic acid, either DNA or RNA. Viruses do not reproduce by division, such as bacteria, yeasts or other cells, but they replicate in the living cells that they infect. In them, they develop their genomic activity and produce the components from which they are made. They encode neither their own protein synthesis machinery (ribosomes) nor energy-generating metabolic pathways. Therefore, viruses are intracellular parasites. They are able to re-route and modify the course of cellular processes for the optimal execution of their own reproduction. Besides the genetic information encoding their structural components, they additionally possess genes that code for several regulatory active proteins (such as transactivators) and enzymes (e.g. proteases and polymerases).\n",

After infection, some virus types can transition into a state of latency by integrating their genetic information into the genome of the host cell, or maintain it as an episome in an extrachromosomal status within infected cells. Certain viral genes can be transcribed during that time, contributing to the maintenance of latency (herpesviruses). In other cases, the expression of the viral genome is completely repressed over long periods of time (e.g. in some animal pathogenic retroviruses). In both cases, cellular processes or external influences can reactivate the latent genomes, leading to a new generation of infectious viruses. Depending on the virus type, the infection can have different consequences for the host cell:It is destroyed and dies.It survives, but continuously produces small numbers of viruses and is chronically (persistently) infected.It survives and the viral genome remains in a latent state without producing infectious particles.It is immortalized, thus gaining the capability of unlimited cell division, a process that can be associated with malignant transformation into a tumour cell.\n",

Depending on the virus type, the nucleic acid is single-stranded or double-stranded, linear, circular or segmented. Single-stranded RNA and DNA genomes can have different polarity, and in certain cases the RNA genome is similar to messenger RNA, e.g. in picornaviruses and flaviviruses. A single-stranded genome that has the same polarity as the messenger RNA is referred to as a positive or plus strand. The genome forms a nucleocapsid complex with cellular histones (polyomaviruses) or viral proteins (e.g. rhabdoviruses, paraviruses, orthomyxoviruses, adenoviruses and herpesviruses). This nucleic acid-protein complex can be surrounded by particular protein structures, the capsids (in polyomaviruses, papillomaviruses, adenoviruses and herpesviruses). In some cases (such as picornaviruses, flaviviruses, togaviruses and parvoviruses), the nucleic acid interacts directly with the capsids. In viruses containing an envelope, the capsid layer can be absent (as in coronaviruses, rhabdoviruses, paramyxoviruses, orthomyxoviruses, bunyaviruses and arenaviruses).\n",

The two planes of symmetry, i.e. the longitudinal and the transversal axes, differ in length (Fig. 2.2a). By contrast, spherical capsids have an icosahedral structure with a rotational symmetry; an icosahedron consists of 20 equilateral triangles and 12 vertices (Fig. 2.2b).

Usually, viral surface components are clearly exposed, and they can protrude up to 20 nm from the particle surface. If such a membrane envelope is present, it renders the virus sensitive to inactivation by solvents and detergents.

Therefore, viruses change by mutation and selection preferentially the amino acid sequences of antibody-binding regions or epitopes, which are responsible for binding neutralizing immunoglobulins. In some species of viruses, this variability of the surface regions leads to the formation new subtypes. In addition to this continuous change of the surface of exposed regions that is determined by mutation and selection, in some virus types another source of variability is possible by genetic recombination, by which even large nucleic acid regions can be exchanged between different viruses. This can lead to substantial changes in the viruses involved and to the generation of new viral species.",

Virusoids are usually found together with plant viruses, but also hepatitis D virus, which can only proliferate when the cell is simultaneously infected with hepatitis B virus, is a virusoid (10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_19). Viroids are plant pathogens and consist of a circular RNA (about 200\u2013400 nucleotides) that does not code for proteins and exhibits a complex two-dimensional structure. A central sequence motif is highly conserved and essential for replication of these nucleic acid molecules. Other regions are variable and may be responsible for virulence. These infectious RNA molecules are replicated by cellular polymerases in a rolling circle mechanism (10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_3), whereby secondary structures are formed at the transitions, which are known as a hammerhead because of their form. They have RNase activity, and autocatalytically cleave the concatemeric RNA strands that result after replication. Ribozymes, small RNA species with sequence-specific RNase activity (10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_9), are derived from the hammerhead-like RNA structures.",

These viruses were originally regarded as bacteria because of the extraordinary size of their spherical capsids (400 nm) and protein filaments, which protrude extremely from the surface, conferring the virions with an apparent size of up to 800 nm. Therefore, they were denominated \u201cmimiviruses\u201d as an abbreviation for \u201cmimicking viruses\u201d. The DNA genome of mimiviruses comprises 1.2 million base pairs and encompasses more than 1,200 putative genes. Even larger mamaviruses have been discovered in amoebae, which can be infected by parasitic viruses. These significantly smaller viruses (sputnikvirus), also known as virophages, can multiply in amoebae only if they are concurrently infected by mamaviruses. However, sputniks do not use mamaviruses only as a helper virus, but also inhibit their proliferation and morphogenesis, thus making them virtually sick.",

They can be transmitted within a species, and \u2013 albeit limited \u2013 to other organisms beyond species boundaries (10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_21). The pathogen responsible (prion, from \u201cproteinaceous infectious particle\u201d) does not require a coding nucleic acid in the infectious agent. Prions are composed of the pathological isoform (PrPSc), which exists especially in \u03b2-sheet conformation, and of a non-pathological cellular prion protein (PrPC), which is present predominantly in \u03b1-helical conformation. The conversion of the PrPC \u03b1-helical conformation into the \u03b2-sheet PrPSc variant is associated with completely different biochemical properties, and is the key pathogenetic basic principle of prion diseases. After its synthesis, the cellular protein PrPC arrives in the cytoplasmic membrane. PrPC is active at the cell surface only for a limited time, and is subsequently degraded in the endosomes. During this process, a small proportion of PrPC proteins are constantly transformed into PrPSc variants. This process is referred to as prion conversion. PrPSc proteins cannot be efficiently degraded and accumulate in the cells. The function of PrPC has not been completely resolved. Experiments with knockout mice containing a deletion of the PrP coding genome sequences revealed that PrPC appears to be dispensable for development and survival of the mice. However, without PrPC they cannot develop a prion disease.",
