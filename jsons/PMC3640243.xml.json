However, the knowledge of reporting requirements and responsibilities among health-care personnel has not been examined adequately as a cause of under-reporting.9 In Nigeria, the collection, collation, analysis, and interpretation of data in health-care facilities are often unsatisfactory, partly due to insufficient awareness among health-care personnel on the importance of this process.10 Studies on DSN have been carried out in Benin, Yobe but none has been conducted in Anambra State.910 The study will also contribute to research in DSN in Nigeria and in the West African Subregion. It is therefore in the light of the above that a study on the DSN in Anambra State is necessary. This study will no doubt identify the militating factors, proffer solutions, and help in making informed suggestions toward the formulation of policies and improvement of the DSN system in the state. The objective of this study therefore is to determine awareness and knowledge of health-care workers about DSN on one hand, and availability of facility records in Anambra State, Nigeria.",

It was however reported that there were no such workshops for other health-care workers. This is not surprising, as previous training on DSN was done at the national and regional levels.17",

Some studies showed that the knowledge of diseases that must be reported vary significantly from 39 to 96%.18\u201320 However, the findings of this study conform with those of other studies which showed poor knowledge of health-care personnel on reporting of infectious diseases and notifiable conditions.9101621 In Benin Nigeria for instance, only 11.9% of doctors studied had a good knowledge of DSN. This showed that lack of knowledge of reporting requirements seems to be a major factor affecting DSN. The resultant negative effect was that these health-care workers were unable to detect and notify the occurrence of diseases that have high case fatality rates and are of public health-care importance.",
