The father, a 33-year-old with previous good health, was admitted on Feb 11, 2003, with a 4-day history of fever, malaise, sore throat, cough with blood-stained sputum, and bone pain. He had a lymphocyte count of 0\u00b76\u00d7109/L (normal range 1\u00b75\u20134\u00b70\u00d7109/L) and radiological evidence of right lower-lobe consolidation. Bacteriological investigations including sputum and blood cultures and acid-fast stain of sputum were unremarkable. Despite treatment with intravenous cefotaxime and oral clarithromycin, clinical and radiological signs showed that the patient was deteriorating. 2 days after admission, oral oseltamivir (75 mg twice daily) was added to his treatment regimen. The patient was electively intubated because of progressive respiratory distress, but his condition worsened and he died 6 days after admission.",

However, we have shown previously that H5N1 virus isolated from humans in 1997 are able to induce the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines including TNF \u03b1, type 1 interferons4 and IP-10 (unpublished data) from macrophages infected in vitro; we have postulated that immune dysregulation has a part in pathogenesis of this disease.4 TNF \u03b1 and interferons are early-phase cytokines that act locally to trigger a cascade of other cytokines including IP-10, interleukin 1, and interleukin 6. IP-10 is a macrophage chemoattractant and its presence might explain the prominent macrophage inflammatory infiltrate in the lung (figure 1). Secretion of MIG is induced by interferon \u03b3 released from activated T helper cells as well as TNF \u03b1 and it indicates the activation of the Th-1 pathway. Taken together with the in-vitro data that H5N1 viruses greatly stimulate cytokine release, the unusually high concentrations of IP-10 and MIG in serum could be the result of a massive overall induction of cytokines such as TNF \u03b1 within the microenvironment of the lung, thus contributing to disease pathogenesis.",

Therefore, workers planning for influenza pandemics must understand the mechanisms of interspecies transmission and the basis for the unusual pathogenicity of such disease in human beings. Furthermore, the re-emergence of H5N1 disease in humans emphasises the need to develop a vaccine against this virus.",
