In thousands of studied pregnancies over the past decades, no indications were seen to show that treatment with penicillins is embryo- or fetotoxic (e.g. Cooper 2009, Jepsen 2003, Dencker 2002, Czeizel et al., 2000a, Czeizel et al., 2000e). Nevertheless, a few studies have discussed an association with cleft palate and maternal use of amoxicillin or ampicillin (Lin 2012, Puh\u00f3 2007). Lin (2012) discussed an absolute cleft risk of 2\u20134 per 1,000, a quite modest increase compared to the background risk. M\u00f8lgaard-Nielsen (2012) could not find an increased risk for oral clefts after intrauterine amoxicillin exposure; but they saw an increased risk for cleft palate after pivmecillinam exposure in the third month. In one investigation of more than 2,000 pregnant women exposed to pivmecillinam \u2013 more than 500 of them in the first trimester \u2013 found neither an increased malformation rate nor other abnormalities in the newborns (Vinther Skriver 2004). Pregnant women who are treated with penicillin for syphilis may develop the Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction \u2013 a febrile reaction, often with headache and myalgia. Fetal monitoring is recommended in such cases, as uterine contractions may occur (Myles 1998). The carboxypenicillins carbenicillin and ticarcillin also did not show any adverse effects in animal experiments, but experience in humans is very limited.",

An increased incidence of pyloric stenosis was discussed by the same author (K\u00e4ll\u00e9n 2005a). This observation after intrauterine exposure in the first trimester is biologically not plausible; but it should be mentioned that a link has been suggested between a neonatal treatment with erythromycin during the first two weeks and the development of pylorus stenosis (e.g. Mahon 2001). Other studies have failed to find a higher rate of septum defects, pyloric stenosis or other malformations (Bahat Dinur 2013, Lin 2013, Rom\u00f8ren 2012, Malm 2008, Cooper 2002, Louik 2002). In summary, the experiences argue against an increased embryo- and fetotoxic risk for erythromycin.",

Because rifampicin inhibits DNA-dependent RNA polymerase, there has been concern that it might interfere with fetal development. Until now, no reports in the literature have confirmed this fear. There is apparently no increased risk of malformations. A long-term therapy of the mother could result in inhibition of vitamin K synthesis, and result in a higher bleeding tendency in neonates.RecommendationRifampicin is a first-line drug for treatment of tuberculosis during pregnancy. When used near term the newborn should receive an extended vitamin K prophylaxis (Chapter 2.9).

No other increased risks of adverse birth outcomes among the infants have been observed. One child had a ventricular septal defect. This was the only major malformation after exposure in the first trimester (Svensson 2011). Another publication included 619 pregnant women exposed to oseltamivir, 159 of them in first trimester.

One congenital heart defect was observed among 49 infants who were exposed during first trimester. No significant association between adverse fetal outcomes and exposure to oseltamivir during pregnancy could be found (Beau 2014).

National and international guidelines recommend a standard therapy for both nonpregnant and pregnant HIV-infected women take a combination of at least three antiretroviral medications (EACS 2013, OARAC 2012, WHO 2010c). This highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) typically consists of two NRTIs and either a protease inhibitor (PI), or a non-nucleoside analog reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI). The intention is that the suppression of the plasma HIV load (HIV-RNA) should be as close to <50 copies/mL at least by the end of the pregnancy. When an effective HAART is applied during pregnancy and lactation, the HIV rate of transmission can be decreased from its former levels of 20\u201330% to <1% (Townsend 2008, Warszawski 2008). The decision of what regimen to use is already complicated in nonpregnant patients, but more so in pregnancy. How to balance individual needs and risks should be considered, especially in view of the timing of the start of treatment, a possible interruption of therapy during the first trimester in women already under treatment, and the selection of appropriate antiretroviral medications.",

With the exception of efavirenz, there have been no serious signs of teratogenic or fetotoxic damages in humans (e.g. Watts 2011, ECS 2003). Prospectively documented pregnancies do not demonstrate a higher risk of malformations and, like retrospective case reports, fail to reveal any distinct pattern of anomalies. When antiretroviral agents are used in the first trimester, the embryotoxic risk appears to be generally small (Phiri 2014, Floridia 2013, Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry 2010, Joao 2010). Nevertheless, substances that might be embryotoxic should be eschewed in early pregnancy. Common side effects in children treated in utero or after birth with zidovudine or antiretroviral combinations consist of hematologic problems, especially anemias and neutropenias (Dryden-Peterson 2011, Feiterna-Sperling 2007, Le Chenadec 2003). It is being debated if antiretroviral treatment with or without protease inhibitors favors prematurity (Chen 2012, Patel 2010, Kourtis 2007, Cotter 2006, Tuomala 2005). The maternal risks of therapy are discussed with the specific medications.",

In individual cases it needs to be critically assessed if an ongoing or maternally indicated treatment is absolutely necessary during the time of embryogenesis, or if it can be temporarily suspended.\nRecommendationAntiretroviral medications may be used in pregnancy. Specific risks for the prophylaxis of transmission and the therapy of maternal HIV infection need to be observed. The choice of medication and the timing of treatment have to be decided on an individual basis. When choosing medications it should be noted that some of the retroviral substances should be avoided during pregnancy, if possible. This concerns efavirenz (teratogenic effects) and the combination stavudine/didanosine (lactic acidosis). For newer medications such as maraviroc, raltegravir and etravirine, few or no data are available concerning their use in pregnancy. Caution is called for when nevirapine is used in women with CD4 cell counts of <250/mm mm3 (hepatotoxicity). If nevirapine is used during pregnancy, transaminases need to be checked regularly, especially during the first 18 weeks of treatment; also, clinical symptoms are to be watched. The short-term use of nevirapine for transmission prophylaxis does not seem to carry a similar risk.When exposure occurs during the first trimester, a detailed ultrasound examination should be offered to ascertain the normal development of the fetus. It is recommended that the pregnant patient is cared for in a specialized center. Physicians should report pregnancies involving the use of HIV medications shortly after diagnosis to the Antiviral Pregnancy Registry (www.APRegistry.com).\n",

According to data from the Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry (2013) the malformation rate of 3.2% (129 of 4,000 births) was not significant higher than that of the general US population. The application of zidovudine has been well studied in pregnancy and is considered to be safe in regard to short-term and medium-term toxicities. A common side effect, when zidovudine is used in the perinatal period, is a transient anemia in newborns (Sperling 1998, Connor 1994). A follow-up study of 234 children who had been exposed to zidovudine in utero did not display any physical, immunological, or cognitive anomalies. The median age of children at the time of last follow-up was 4.2 years (range, 3.2\u20135.6 years) (Culnane 1999). Also, there was no evidence of an increased risk for neoplasia in more than 700 children after pre- and perinatal exposure (Culnane 1999, Hanson 1999). There are no data regarding long-term toxicity, especially for cancerogenicity.",

Studies indicate that pregnancy per se is a risk factor for liver toxicity. Pregnant patients using HAART that includes nevirapin have no higher risk of hepatotoxicity than those who use HAART without nevirapine (Ouyang 2010, Ouyang 2009). These data suggest that the risk of liver toxicity of nevirapine is similar in pregnant and nonpregnant patients.

Some experts recommend an increased dose in late pregnancy. The umbilical cord blood of neonates shows atazanavir levels of 13\u201316% of those seen in the maternal serum. Atazanavir inhibits the uridin glucuronosyl transferase that metabolizes indirect bilirubin. Thus, as a common side effect, atazanavir treatment may lead to higher indirect bilirubin levels. While case numbers are relatively small, investigations showed that neonates of atazanavir-treated mothers did not show pathological elevations of indirect bilirubin.
