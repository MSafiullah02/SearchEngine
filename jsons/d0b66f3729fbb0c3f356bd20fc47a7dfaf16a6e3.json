The difficulty in obtaining these cells and their limited life span restricted the study of long term host-pathogen interactions and xenobiotic metabolism. Hepatitis C virus is a single positive-stranded RNA virus belonged to the genus of Hepacivirus and Flaviviridae family (Simmonds et al., 2005) . Chronic HCV infection led to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (Chisari, 2005 ). An estimated 130-150 million people globally have chronic HCV infection and there is no effective vaccine to protect against HCV. Recently, the treatment of HCV using direct-acting antivirals (DAA) drugs such as sofosbuvir and simeprevir could eradicate HCV infection. However, several DAA drugs resistance have been reported (Imhof & Simmonds, 2011; Jazwinski & Muir, 2011) . The development of effective HCV culture models is critical for designing efficacious anti-HCV strategies. The studies on HCV life cycle and anti-HCV drugs relied on human hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines such as Huh7 and their derivative clones. Only HCV genotype 2a (JFH-1) could be propagated from Huh7 derived cells (Catanese & Dorner, 2015; Wakita et al., 2005) . The application of hepatocellular carcinoma cells as a host for HCV could not fully mimic primary human hepatocytes. The genotype and phonotype of cancer cell are abnormal. Huh7 cells also lose their contact inhibition dissimilar to the primary hepatocytes which mostly present in quiescent stage. Most hepatocellular carcinoma cells usually lack several liver enzymes e.g., CYP450s, other phase I, II, and drug transporters that make them inadequate for the anti-HCV drug screening.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 109, "end": 130, "text": "(Kaneko et al., 2016;", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 145, "end": 175, "text": "(Sa-Ngiamsuntorn et al., 2016)", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 194, "end": 211, "text": "(Ng et al., 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 231, "end": 264, "text": "(Lang, Vera, Cheng, & Tang, 2016)", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 542, "end": 565, "text": "(Simmonds et al., 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 636, "end": 650, "text": "(Chisari, 2005", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 980, "end": 1004, "text": "(Imhof & Simmonds, 2011;", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1005, "end": 1028, "text": "Jazwinski & Muir, 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1354, "end": 1379, "text": "(Catanese & Dorner, 2015;", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1380, "end": 1400, "text": "Wakita et al., 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "INTRODUCTION"}, {"text": "Human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) can be reprogramed from somatic cells through ectopic expression of Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-MYC (Takahashi & Yamanaka, 2006; Takahashi et al., 2007) .

This protocol can be applied to differentiate the conventional hES cell lines into HLCs. The procedure uses defined culture medium devoid of serum and non-defined factors and contains four steps, which mimic embryonic liver development stages. The procedure begins with expansion of iPSCs in cell culture plate followed by the first stage differentiation protocol. The iPSCs are differentiated into definitive endoderm cells. In the second stage, differentiated cells are developed into anterior definite endoderm cells. During the third stage, the endodermal cells turned into hepatic progenitors.

HCV infection is the leading cause of life-threatening chronic liver disease and affects \u00df3% of the world population (Gondeau et al., 2014) . Current in vivo model of HCV is limited to humans and chimpanzees owing to ethical concerns, economics, and the technical boundaries of in vivo experiment (Billerbeck, de Jong, Dorner, de la Fuente, & Ploss, 2013) . Different in vitro models that support the entire HCV life cycle (entry, replication, assembly, release) and the host reacting innate immune response have been demonstrated (Steinmann & Pietschmann, 2013) . However, our current knowledge of HCV life cycle is largely dependent on the molecular clone JFH-1 (HCV genotype 2a) that replicates in a few hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines with resulting infectious particles (HCVcc) production (Saeed et al., 2015) .Hepatocytes can host HCV infection and allow infectious viral production (Zhong et al., 2005) . Since the discovery of HCV in 1989, a major burden impeding HCV study has been the lack of robust hepatocyte culture model to grow HCV derived from patient serum (HCVser) (Saeed et al., 2015) . The significant improvement has been made with the isolation of a HCV genotype 2a from Japanese patient suffering with fulminant hepatitis (JFH-1). The JFH-1 HCV together with human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line, Huh7 or its derivatives brought a promising cell culture model to study the entire HCV life cycle (Wakita et al., 2005) . The application of hepatocellular carcinoma as a natural HCV host could not completely mimic primary human hepatocyte. Cancer cells usually lack some specific factors necessary for the repli-cation of HCV derived from patient serum. The newly identified factor, SEC14L2 promotes HCV infection by enhancing vitamin E-mediated protection against lipid peroxidation. The exogenous expression of SEC14L2 in Huh7.5 cell line allowed HCVser to replicate in hepatocellular carcinoma cell line (Colpitts & Baumert, 2015) . Even though the lacking of essential host factor for HCVser infection was solved, the impairment of various liver functional enzymes such as CYP450s and other phase I, II, and III drug metabolizing enzymes make the hepatoma cells awkwardly unfitt] for the assessment of anti-HCV drug interaction and metabolism (Blight, McKeating, Marcotrigiano, & Rice, 2003) .Human-induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) can be generated from the somatic cells using exogenous expression of the reprogramming factors (Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-MYC). The iPSCs can differentiate into other cells, thus serve as a new model for drug discovery, disease modeling, and toxicity assessment (Greenbaum, 2010) . Recently, several investigators reported that iPSC can develop into functional hepatocyte-like cell (HLCs) that exhibited various functions associated with mature hepatocytes (Roy-Chowdhury, Wang, Guha, & Roy-Chowdhury, 2016). The applications of HLC derived from pluripotent stem cell as a natural host for HCV have been reported (Yoshida et al., 2011) . Differentiated HLCs exhibited important liver functions and achieved closely mature hepatocytes, including \u03b1-fetoprotein, albumin, phase I and phase II drug metabolizing enzymes. Importantly, HLCs also expressed known HCV host receptors involved in HCV entry (Claudin-1, Occludin, SR-BI, CD81) and supported entire life cycle of HCV genotype 2a up to 21 d (Wu et al., 2012) . Nonetheless, the maturity, homogeneity and long-term stability of these HLCs have not been revealed. The HLCs not a single band (with minimal smear of incomplete products) would indicate degradation or incomplete in vitro transcription. This could negatively affect intracellular HCV RNA replication after the transfection. The treatment with an RNase inhibitor and the optimization of incubation time during the transcription can improve the integrity of the HCV RNA genome. If longer RNA strand are detected, it might indicate that the plasmid DNA is not completely linearized and can interfere the transcription of the desired product. This problem can be resolved using either the linearized template DNA band prepared from agarose gel electrophoresis or another RNA template.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 142, "end": 157, "text": "(Chisari, 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 277, "end": 299, "text": "(Gondeau et al., 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 457, "end": 515, "text": "(Billerbeck, de Jong, Dorner, de la Fuente, & Ploss, 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 691, "end": 722, "text": "(Steinmann & Pietschmann, 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 958, "end": 978, "text": "(Saeed et al., 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 1053, "end": 1073, "text": "(Zhong et al., 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 1247, "end": 1267, "text": "(Saeed et al., 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 1586, "end": 1607, "text": "(Wakita et al., 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 2096, "end": 2122, "text": "(Colpitts & Baumert, 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 2436, "end": 2484, "text": "(Blight, McKeating, Marcotrigiano, & Rice, 2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 2790, "end": 2807, "text": "(Greenbaum, 2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 3141, "end": 3163, "text": "(Yoshida et al., 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 3522, "end": 3539, "text": "(Wu et al., 2012)", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "COMMENTARY Background Information"}, {"text": "The most important factor in the generation of high-titer HCV stocks is the quality of host cells during production.

The minor protocols also describe the characterization and detection of iPSCs, HLCs, HCV host cell receptors and HCV titer including the production of HCV infectious particles.
