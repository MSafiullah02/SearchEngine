One of the characteristics for which Open Source Software has gained attention, over the years, is the fact that it is continuously being tested and maintained by its community of volunteers. Sentiment analysis, a rapidly growing field, can enrich software evaluation with a social aspect. Results suggest that FLOSS projects' bug reports can potentially constitute a rich emotionallyimbued information source.",

Eric S. Raymond [1] highlights this strength; \"Given a large enough betatester and co-developer base, almost every problem will be characterized quickly and the fix obvious to someone\". In the community of an Open Source Software project we find developers who usually contribute both in the development and test process. In addition, community members can also be people who do not possess development skills but use the project as end users and contribute to testing. Cerone et al. [2] stress the importance of defining qualitative metrics for indicators of collaboration effectiveness within Open Source Software communities.",

Similarly, Garcia et al. [9] perform sentiment analysis on the email archives of another FLOSS project (Gentoo) and attempt to investigate the relation between the emotions in the mailing list and the respective activity of contributors in the project. Finally, the authors of [10] and [11] analyse comments in an issue tracking system, in order to investigate whether a relationship exists between human affectiveness (emotion, sentiment and politeness) and developer productivity (i.e. time needed for fixing an issue).",

            "text": "This section presents the statistical analysis of the data collected. As a first step we tried to identify possible outliers that might be misleading for our results to consider possible data reduction [18] . In the following image you can see a visualization of the number of comments distribution per version of Libre Office and the box plots regarding our variables (Fig. 1) . Fig. 2 and Fig. 3 we can see that our means are being affected by low values of our population. This also becomes obvious by the descriptive statistics provided to Table 1 following. Since this work studies the bugs reported to Libre Office per version, we decided not to proceed to data reduction since the versions that seem to act like outliers are provide valuable information. For example, the increased activity of comments in some of the 4.x versions is since 3.6 version was the version that followed the fork from Open Office after which redesign and refactor processes took place. We also chose to let versions with low concentration of comments, i.e. 6.1, to further investigate if this behavior is due to successful bug fixing or it was just a version with low bug tracking activity. In Table 1 you can see the descriptive analysis of the variables we gathered for the sentiment analysis using the tools described in Sect. 4 (Figs. 4 and 5) . Having concluded with the descriptive analysis of the chosen variables we then proceeded in studying our selected variables regarding their normality. Since the descriptive analysis is showing (Table 1 ) skewness with values around or bigger than 1 we have the indication that some of our variables might not follow the normal distribution. Therefore, we proceeded in applying the Shapiro-Wilk normality test in order to identify which variables follow the normal distribution and which do not from the results we are seeing that there are variables with p-value > 0.05 therefore parametric statistical analysis cannot be carried for them in this study since their data might not follow the normal distribution. Therefore, we will be conducting our statistical tests with the use of nonparametric tests and more specifically using the Spearman's Rank Correlation Coefficient (Table 3) .",

We conducted our experiment in 16 major versions of the software and gathered the respective data (as analyzed in Sect. 4) for 740 bugs consisted of threaded discussions with 6960 comments in total. We proceeded in sentiment analysis of these comments using two different tools (Vader & Meaning Cloud) and statistically analyzed the results. Our first goal in this investigation was to get a result on whether the sentiment analysis of comments in bug report is meaningful. Given that bug reporting is a technical process, usually made by technical oriented people (developers, and so forth) one might argue that the text of the reports could be standardized with technical language and therefore, possible lack of sentiment. In Table 2 , showing the descriptive analysis of the confidence metric of the sentiment analysis across the versions of Libre Office, we can see that the mean is > 90% for all the versions. This gives us a first indicator that the confidence of the sentiment analysis (which is done with the MeaningCloud tool) is strong across all our data. In Table 4 we performed a nonparametric test to get results regarding the similarities for the positive, neutral and negative groups of comments between the two tools we have used. We see that the tests show significant similarities in the distributions of Positive, Neutral and Negative groups of comments for both Vader and Meaning Cloud.",

This seems to be intuitively logical if we consider that Bugzilla is a tool to which a community of Libre Office users (many of them voluntarily) report bugs.
