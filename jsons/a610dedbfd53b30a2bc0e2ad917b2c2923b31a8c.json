            "text": "In December 2019, a coronavirus disease (named as COVID-19 later) was reported in Wuhan 39 city, which rapidly spread throughout China and then to many other countries in the world ( showed two distinct clinical phenotypes from 4 DPI. One mouse (G-D5-M3) was found dead 4 104 DPI, and two lost weight 4 DPI and were humanely euthanized 5 DPI. The remaining mouse 105 began to lose weight 6 DPI and was humanely euthanized 7 DPI. In total, these four mice 106 showed significant body weight decreases from days 4 to 6 and generated noticeable respiratory 107 distress and neurological symptoms before death or humane euthanisation. All other mice 108 survived to the endpoint without evident symptoms (Table S1 and Figure 1B) . 109 110 White blood cells (WBC) analysis indicated that the levels of most neutrophils and monocytes 111 began to increase in the peripheral blood at day 1, peaked at day 3, and decreased 5 and 7 DPI in 112 the infected group, compared with those of control mice ( Figure S1 ). The infected mice 113 demonstrated a reduced ratio of lymphocytes 1 DPI. However, lymphocytes ratio recovered, 114 beginning on 3 DPI. All the dying mice (dead or lost >20% body weigh) showed significantly 115 decreased lymphocytes numbers, which is one of the key clinical hallmarks of COVID-19 116 patients . Five mice showed significantly higher levels of creatine kinase 117 compared with those of the control group, which may be linked to muscle fatigue, soreness, or 118 myocarditis (Table S2 ). The deceased mice showed higher aspartate transaminase and creatine 119 kinase levels than the control group. These data suggested that SARS-CoV-2-infected mice 120 generate symptoms that partly resembled human infection symptoms (Chen et To better understand viral replication in hACE2 mice, viral RNA was quantified by RT-qPCR in 153 different tissues from mice euthanized at 1, 3, 5, and 7 DPI (Figures 3A-D) . The viral nucleic 154 acid was detected in all lungs from 1 DPI, and slowly increased until 5 DPI, and then decreased 155 beginning 7 DPI ( Figure 3A ). We also found low viral RNA copies in the eyes and hearts in 156 eight and two infected mice, respectively ( Figures 3B and 3C) . No viral RNA was detected in 157 other organs. Viral antigens were detected in bronchial epithelial cells and alveolar cells of the 158 lungs using immunohistological assays with cross-reactive antibody that has been used for 159 SARS-CoV-2 detection previously (Zhou et al., 2020) ( Figure 3E) . Notably, four of the animals 160 demonstrated SARS-CoV-2 neuroinvasion of the brain, but only in the deceased mice ( Figure  161 3D). However, the exact details and mechanisms regulating SARS-CoV-2 neuroinvasion remain 162 unclear, as this phenomenon has been previously described with this mouse model (Menachery 163 et al., 2016) . We then tried to re-isolate SARS-CoV-2 from infected animals. We inoculated 164",

The left lobe 124 of infected mice was fixed, sectioned, and stained with hematoxylin-eosin. A similar sample 125 [First Authors Last Name] Page 7 [Insert Running title of <72 characters] from one healthy mouse was used as a negative control. Pathological sections showed different 126 levels of pneumonia throughout the infection course. At 1 DPI, some minor changes were 127 observed in the lung tissues of infected mice, including minor multifocal lesions, a few alveolar 128 walls thickened with monocyte and lymphocyte infiltration and increased numbers of 129 macrophages and lymphocytes in some alveolar spaces with minor exudation of fibrin (Figures 130 2B and 2C) compared with those in the control (Figure 2A). Moderate interstitial pneumonia 131 appeared at 3 DPI, including multifocal lesions, increased inflammatory cells (lymphocytes and 132 monocytes) at peri-bronchial and peri-vascular infiltration, and fibroblast hyperplasia with 133 exudation of fibrin and protein oedema in some alveoli (Figures 2D and 2G). Two distinct 134 categories were observed after 5 DPI. Eight mice (72.7%) only show mild peri-bronchial and 135 peri-vascular infiltration at 5 DPI (Figures 2E and 2H) and 7 DPI (Figures 2J and 2M), while 136 the other three (27.3%) suffered from more severe pneumonia. In the latter category, the mouse 137 lungs showed consistently massive peri-bronchial and peri-vascular mixed inflammatory cell 138 infiltration, fibroplasia or organization, congestion, oedema with hyaline membrane formation 139 with some blocked terminal bronchioles, and dissolved and necrosis in some alveolar cells at 5 140 DPI (Figures 2F and 2I), 7 DPI(Figures 2K and 2N) and upon death(Figures 2L and 2O). 141Quantitative pathological scoring showed the same trends with the HE pathology observation 142 (Figure S2). Hyaline thrombus and fibrin were also observed in the lungs following Martius 143 Scarlet Blue (MSB) staining of the tissue samples(Figures 2Q and 2R) compared with the 144 control (Figure 2P). Since higher creatine kinase may result from myocardial or muscle damage, 145we examined the histology of heart tissue. The heart tissues of infected mice showed oedema in 146 some cardiomyocytes and several necrotic myocytes (Figure S3B) compared with the control 147 (Figure S3A).

All previous survivors 197 also survived the second infection. At the same time, two of the three na\u00efve-infected mice 198 demonstrated rapid bodyweight loss from 4 to 5 DPI with a male and female animal dead at 4 199 DPI and 5 DPI, respectively (Figures 5A and 5B). All mice were euthanised at 5 DPI to 200 evaluate viral titers and pathologic changes in the lung and brain tissues. Survivors had markedly 201 lower viral RNA copies in the lung and did not present any evidence of neuroinvasion compared 202 with those of the na\u00efve-infected animals (Figure 5C). Histopathology of the lungs of the re-203 infected survivor cohort showed moderate inflammatory infiltration. In contrast, the peri-204 branchial and peri-vascular inflammation infiltration, hyaline membrane formation, and some 205 blocked terminal bronchioles were observed in the na\u00efve-infected group (Figures 5D and 5E). 206 Limited viral antigen was detected in the lung and brain tissues of the surviving cohort of mice 207 compared with that of the na\u00efve infection group (Figures 5F-5I). The deceased mice showed 208 systemic infection due to the high viral dose challenge (Table S5). These data demonstrate that 209 pre-exposure to SARS-CoV-2 may protect mice from a lethal SARS-CoV-2 reinfection, which 210 underscores the values of this model for future therapeutic studies. Insert Running title of <72 characters] As a cost-effective and easily manipulated animal model, mice are widely used in biomedical 214 research. Various genetically modified mice have been generated to meet the demands of 215 different projects. Wild type mice have low levels of ACE2 expression, which limits their use as 216 an infection model for SARSr-CoVs, which use ACE2 as a receptor. Previous studies indicated 217 that HFH4-hACE2 mice are susceptible to SARS-CoV and bat SARSr-CoV WIV1 infection 218 (Menachery et al., 2016), suggesting that this model can be used to evaluate the pathogenicity of 219 all SARSr-CoVs using ACE2 as a receptor. In this study, we successfully established a SARS-220 CoV-2 infection model using these transgenic mice. In our results, the infected mice had two 221 different outcomes, recovery, and death. Significant weight loss was only observed in dead and 222 severely diseased mice. Thus, weight loss could serve as a good indicator for monitoring disease 223 progression. Our results provide strong evidence that SARS-CoV-2 infection could cause typical 224 interstitial pneumonia in hACE2-expressing mice, and that progeny virus could be re-isolated 225 from diseased animal tissues. 226 227 COVID-19 patients commonly exhibit pneumonia with typical signs including fever, cough, 228 dyspnea, and bilateral lung infiltration (Guan et al., 2020). Biopsy of the lungs showed evident 229 desquamation of pneumocytes and hyaline membrane formation from one patient (Xu et al., 230 2020). After SARS-CoV-2 infection, the hACE2-experssing mice showed apparent interstitial 231 pneumonia with inflammatory cell infiltration. Severe pneumonia in mice was accompanied by 232 fibroplasia, organization, congestion, and oedema with hyaline membrane formation. Some 233 alveolar cells were dissolved and necrotic, and some terminal bronchioles were blocked, which 234 simulated the pathological findings in COVID-19 patients (Xu et al., 2020). During routine blood 235 examination, lymphopenia is a common feature in COVID-19 patients, and some patients had 236 [First Authors Last Name] Page 12 [Insert Running title of <72 characters] high-level AST and CK (Chen et al., 2020; Guan et al., 2020). The blood routine examination 237 results in SARS-CoV-2 infected mice were not entirely consistent with human patients, while the 238 apparent lymphopenia was only observed in the dying mice. In our mouse model, the male mice 239 showed a much higher death rate than the female, which partially reflects the observation 240 infection outcome in humans (Channappanavar et al., 2017; Peretz et al., 2016; WHO, 2020). 241 Gender-based susceptibility differences have been reported in SARS-CoV infected mice, which 242 demonstrates that the male mice are more susceptible to SARS-CoV infection than the female 243 (Channappanavar et al., 2017). Compared with SARS-CoV infection, HFH4-hACE2 mice 244 infected with SARS-CoV-2 showed lower mortality rate but comparable viral titres in the lung 245 tissues which may partially reflect the lower mortality in SARS-CoV-2 patients. 246 247",

Our study cautioned that 251 special care should be taken for these viral targets, especially as the brain and eyes can be 252 persistently infected by other acute RNA viruses, such as Ebola virus(Shantha et al., 2018). 253There are few reports about organ tropism of virus infection in the patients of COVID-19, but 254 multiple organ infections have been reported in SARS patients(Gu et al., 2005). In our mouse 255 model, the viral RNA was mainly detected in lung tissues at lower virus titre infection. In 256 comparison more positive tissues were detected with higher virus dose infection, in accordance 257 with the tissue ACE2 expression in the HFH4-hACE2 mice. Mice experiencing rapid weight loss 258 were found with high viral RNA in the brain, which is consistent with the results when HFH4-259 [First Authors Last Name] Page 13[Insert Running title of <72 characters] hACE2 mice were infected by the bat SARSr-CoV and SARS-CoV(Menachery et al., 2016). 260Considering that SARS-CoV has been reported in SARS patient brains, mouse brain infection 261 after the SARS-CoV-2 challenge support the potential brain infection in patients(Gu et  al., 2005; 262 Menachery et al., 2016; Xu et al., 2005). Recently, virus was isolated from ocular fluids of 263 SARS-CoV-2 patients (Colavita et al., 2020), which confirms our finding in mouse model and 264 implies a potential eye-based infection and transmission route. 265 266 The surviving mice generated low titres of neutralisation antibodies (1:10 to 1:40). The 267 reinfection with much higher titres of virus (7*10 5 TCID 50 SARS-CoV-2) only caused mild 268 pneumonia in the surviving mice. In contrast, the na\u00efve-infected mice had severe disease with 269 much higher viral RNA copies in the lung and brain tissues. It is unclear that the neutralising 270 antibody or humoral immunity caused the observed protection. Future studies are needed to 271 determine whether cellular immune arms also contribute to the protection from reinfection. 272 273 In summary, a human ACE2 mouse model that partially simulated the pathology of COVID-19, 274 will be a valuable platform for testing vaccines and other potential therapeutics. Although there 275 are drawbacks associated with this model, such as lethal encephalitis, it is also a suitable choice 276 for studying pathogenesis and therapeutic potential on this model before the central nervous 277 syndromes. Other strains of mice, including mice of different ages, which had been previously 278 tested with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infections, should also be verified with SARS-CoV-2 279 (Gretebeck and Subbarao, 2015; Song et al., 2019). During the revision of this manuscript, other 280 researchers tested the susceptibility of SARS-CoV-2 in several animal species. Their results 281 [First Authors Last Name] Page 14 [Insert Running title of <72 characters] demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 could infect hamsters, ferrets and cats with resulting mild 282 symptoms, but not pigs, chickens or ducks (Chan et al., 2020; Shi et al., 2020). The increasing 283 global spread of SARS-CoV-2 promotes the urgent need for coronavirus vaccines and 284 therapeutics. The successful establishment of an animal model for COVID-19 pathogenesis will 285 be valuable for evaluating vaccines and therapeutics to combat SARS-CoV-2. 286 Limitations 287 The HFH4-hACE2 mice showed different susceptibility with the infection of SARS-CoV-2 288 based on gender. The LD50 of SARS-CoV-2 should be determined for different gender mice. 289 The dead mice showed the brain infection which may not reflect the pathogenesis of SARS-290 CoV-2 in humans.
