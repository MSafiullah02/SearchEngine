Children under 7 months of age, who were hospitalized at the Professor Hosannah de Oliveira pediatric hospital in Salvador, Brazil with a diagnosis of respiratory infection, were included. A questionnaire was applied to collect clinical data and laboratory results. Nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) was collected to investigate respiratory viruses. The presence of adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza viruses and parainfluenza viruses was investigated by indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) using a commercially available kit (Chemicon\u00ae Temecula, CA, USA). The presence of HBoV and human rhinoviruses (HRVs) was investigated using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). DNA extraction was performed in the NPA using a commercial kit (Wizard\u00ae Genomic DNA Purification Kit, Promega\u00ae Madison, WI, USA), and RNA extraction was carried out using Trizol\u00ae (Invitrogen\u00ae Carlsbad, CA, USA). HBoV was detected by PCR using the product of DNA extraction.",

Twenty-nine children (43.9%) tested positive for one virus, 10 (15.2%) for two and 1 (1.5%) for three different viruses. HRV (24 cases) and RSV (14 cases) were the viruses most frequently detected. Four children (6.1%) tested positive for HBoV, two of whom were found to be simultaneously infected with other viruses: RSV and enterovirus in one case, and HRV in the other. Their ages ranged from 43 to 191 days. All four children had nasal obstruction and rhonchi, while three had productive coughs, dyspnea, fever and chest indrawing and rales at lung auscultation. Two patients had acute diarrhea. A summary of clinical data and laboratory results is shown in Table 1.\n",

Two children were <2 months of age, suggesting that the infection may occur at a very early age. Clinical findings in children with HBoV in this study were very similar to those previously described [3\u20137]. This study was carried out in hospitalized children; hence presumably more severely ill patients were evaluated. However, only one HBoV-positive patient had radiological findings consistent with pneumonia. In this study, two of the four children with HBoV infection had diarrhea. It is possible that HBoV infection may involve both the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts [14, 15]. In spite of the limited sample size, the present study highlights the fact that HBoV may be present in very young infants hospitalized with ARI.",
