However, in vivo manipulation of FRCs has been limited by a dearth of genetic tools that target this lineage. Here, using a mouse model to conditionally ablate FRCs, we demonstrated their indispensable role in antiviral T cell responses. Unexpectedly, loss of FRCs also attenuated humoral immunity due to impaired B cell viability and follicular organization. Follicle-resident FRCs established a favorable niche for B lymphocytes via production of the cytokine BAFF. Thus, our study indicates that adaptive immunity requires an intact FRC network and identifies a subset of FRCs that control B cell homeostasis and follicle identity.",

One of their most notable features is the segregation of B cells and T cells into discrete domains that consitute structural and functional units for optimal activation of cells of the immune system 1,2 . These specialized environments are inhabited by different subsets of mesenchymal stromal cells, which are commonly viewed as serving a scaffolding function for T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes and dendritic cells. Current dogma holds that fibroblastic reticular cells (FRCs) within the paracortical region coordinate T cell responses, whereas follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) within the cortex support B cell responses. However, precise understanding of how the stromal network of lymphoid organs controls adaptive immunity has not been achievable due to limitations in technology for targeting each of the mesenchymal cell populations.",

Expression of the chemokines CCL19 and CCL21 by FRCs, in addition to the expression of other adhesion molecules, facilitates chemokine receptor CCR7-dependent homing of naive T cells and provides essential guidance cues to dendritic cells that migrate from nonlymphoid tissues into the lymph node paracortex [6] [7] [8] . Additionally, the production of interleukin 7 (IL-7) by FRCs is thought to be essential for preservation of the peripheral T cell pool under homeostatic conditions 9 . FRCs have also been found to control the extent of proliferation of newly activated T cells through the regulated release of nitric oxide [10] [11] [12] .",

            "text": "The two stromal cell populations commonly characterized within the lymph node cortex include FDCs and marginal reticular cells (MRCs). FDCs are characterized by localization within B cell follicles, expression of the complement receptors CR1 (CD35) and CR2 (CD21) and the FDC marker FDCM1 and the ability to display opsonized antigens to B cells. Expression of B cell-trophic factors (the chemokine CXCL13 and the prosurvival factor BAFF (also known as BlyS, TALL-1, TNFSF13B or TNFSF20)) is often attributed to FDCs, which links these cells to shepherding B cells to follicles, supporting B cell survival and coordinating the germinal center reaction [13] [14] [15] [16] . Published work using a system to ablate FDCs has provided definitive evidence that although this stromal subset is critical for germinal center responses, it has only a minor role in B cell homeostasis within resting lymph nodes 17 . Likewise, loss of FDCs is not mirrored by a decrease in the abundance of transcripts encoding BAFF (Tnfsf13b; called 'Baff' here), which indicates the presence of an alternative source. Such observations have led some investigators to postulate that MRCs, which reside in close proximity to the subcapsular sinus of lymph nodes 18 , serve these functions. However, data supporting this hypothesis are not yet available, so the cell population that supports B cell homeostasis within primary follicles has remained unconfirmed. We have developed and experimentally confirmed an inducible mouse model for conditional ablation of FRCs in vivo by crossing mice with transgenic expression of Cre recombinase directed by the Ccl19 promoter (Ccl19-Cre mice) with mice expressing the receptor for diphtheria toxin (DTxn) from the ubiquitous Rosa26 locus (Rosa26-iDTR mice). In the Ccl19-Cre \u00d7 iDTR progeny, administration of DTxn caused rapid and extensive depletion of FRCs but spared other stromal cell populations. Our data demonstrate that ablation of FRCs led to marked alterations in the homeostasis and compartmentalization of T cells, with profound consequences for the activation, population expansion and effector function of viral antigen-specific T lymphocytes. Unexpectedly, the loss of FRCs also led to substantially reduced B cell viability and altered follicular organization, followed by marked impairment in humoral immunity to T cell-dependent and T cell-independent viral antigens. Mechanistically, we determined that a subset of FRCs residing within lymphoid follicles established a favorable niche for B lymphocytes via production of BAFF.",

To address this limitation, a Ccl19-Cre mouse line has been generated that permits targeting of FRCs 19 . By crossing the Ccl19-Cre line to a line of mice expressing enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (eYFP) from the Rosa26 locus (Rosa26-eYFP), we generated Ccl19-Cre \u00d7 Rosa26-eYFP reporter mice in which eYFP expression is achieved following Cre-mediated excision of a loxP-flanked transcriptional 'stop' sequence ( Supplementary  Fig. 1a) . Confocal laser-scanning microscopy of lymph nodes from Ccl19-Cre \u00d7 Rosa26-eYFP mice revealed expression of the Ccl19-Cre transgene in the T cell zone (Fig. 1a,b) , which supported the conclusion of efficient excision of loxP-flanked loci in the expected location. Flow cytometry demonstrated eYFP expression in FRCs, identified as nonhematopoietic cells that expressed PDPN and were negative for the endothelial marker CD31 and the cell-adhesion molecule MadCAM-1 (CD45 \u2212 PDPN + CD31 \u2212 MadCAM \u2212 ) ( Fig. 1c and Supplementary Fig. 1b) . We did not detect eYFP expression in other lymph node stromal cells, including lymphatic endothelial cells (CD45 \u2212 PDPN + CD31 + ), blood endothelial cells (CD45 \u2212 PDPN \u2212 CD31 + ) or integrin \u03b1 7 -expressing pericytes (CD45 \u2212 PDPN \u2212 CD31 \u2212 ) (Fig. 1c) , which confirmed the specificity of the Ccl19 promoter. Despite published reports suggesting a close developmental relationship between FRCs and MRCs (CD45 \u2212 PDPN + CD31 \u2212 Mad CAM + ) 20 , MRCs did not seem to be targeted by the Ccl19-directed Cre recombinase, as demonstrated by flow cytometry and confocal microscopy showing the absence of eYFP expression in MadCAM-1 + cells lining the subcapsular sinus (Fig. 1c-e) .",

In the resulting progeny, cells with an active Ccl19 promoter (FRCs) express the simian DTR and are selectively vulnerable to toxin-induced apoptosis when exposed to DTxn. A single injection of DTxn into these mice was sufficient to achieve rapid and extensive ablation of FRCs from lymph nodes (Fig. 2a-c) . FRCs were lost as early as 24 h following the administration of DTxn (Fig. 2a-c) , and the deletion was specific, as we did not detect changes in cellularity of other lymph node stromal populations, including lymphatic endothelial cells, blood endothelial cells and integrin \u03b1 7 -expressing pericytes (Fig. 2d) . Consistent with FRCs' being the predominant source of CCL19 (refs. 8,9) , expression of Ccl19 in lymph nodes was abrogated after ablation of FRCs, whereas expression of genes shared with other cells, such as Ccl21 (ref. 8) , was only partially reduced ( Fig. 2e,f) . Thus, we were able to detect MadCAM-1 + RANKL + cells along the lymph node subcapsular sinus of mice that had undergone ablation of FRCs ( Fig. 2g and Supplementary Fig. 1d ), which confirmed a lack of Ccl19 promoter activity in MRCs. In line with that finding, the abundance of transcripts encoding the cytokine RANKL (Tnfsf11), which is shared by MRCs and FRCs 8, 18 , was reduced only partially in total lymph node mRNA preparations after ablation of FRCs (Supplementary Fig. 1e) , despite complete abrogation of Ccl19 expression (Fig. 2e) .",

However, those effects were not symptomatic of a global collapse of lymph node architecture, as ablation of FRCs perturbed neither the integrity nor the permeability of the conduit network (Fig. 3c) . The administration of DTxn was not associated with systemic toxicity, and it did not lead to weight loss or extranodal pathology ( Supplementary Fig. 2a and data not shown). Furthermore, we did not observe accumulation of either neutrophils (CD11b + Gr1 hi ) or monocytes (CD11b + Gr1 \u2212 or CD11b + Gr1 lo ) or increased expression of inflammatory cytokines (Supplementary Fig. 2b,c) , which ruled out the possibility of extraneous inflammation secondary to the ablation of FRCs.

Notably, we also observed a global reduction in the number of T cells in lymph nodes (Fig. 4b) , with CD4 + T cells and CD8 + T cells affected equally by the loss of FRCs (Supplementary Fig. 3a,b) . Moreover, expression of the gene encoding the T cell-survival factor IL-7 was also reduced in lymph nodes from mice in which FRCs were ablated (Fig. 4c) , which suggested that diminished T cell viability may have compounded the reduction in T cell numbers. To assess the effect of ablation of FRCs in adaptive T cell responses, we immunized Ccl19-Cre \u00d7 iDTR mice with a replication-incompetent influenza A virus expressing the OT-II ovalbumin peptide and monitored the generation of antigen-specific Ccl21 transcripts (f) in lymph nodes from mice as in a at 24, 28 or 72 h (horizontal axes) after administration of DTxn; results are normalized to those of the gene encoding cyclophillin. Each symbol represents one lymph node from an individual mouse (n = 4-10 per group); small horizontal lines indicate the mean.

Fig. 3c,d) . Loss of FRCs resulted in diminished priming of antigen-specific T cells (Fig. 4d,e) , as well as reduced activation and proliferation ( Fig. 4f-h) . Furthermore, we observed a deterioration of antiviral T cell responses in a coronavirusbased vector system 23 in which we monitored the generation and effector function of exogenously transferred CD8 + T cells with transgenic expression of a T cell antigen receptor specific for the coronavirus spike protein before immunization with coronavirus vectors 24 (Supplementary Fig. 3e) . Strikingly, generation of the virus-specific T cell response was also profoundly disrupted, with reduced numbers of antigen-specific CD8 + T cells and defective interferon-\u03b3 production in mice in which FRCs were ablated (Fig. 4i,j) . Together our data demonstrated a critical role for FRCs in the homeostasis, positioning and activation of T cells.",

B cell numbers were also reduced in the spleen (Supplementary Fig. 4i ), although to a lesser extent than in lymph nodes (Supplementary Fig. 4j) . Functionally, the effects observed in the spleen affected marginal zone humoral responses, with a significant decrease in IgM production upon immunization with the antigen TNP-Ficoll (2,4,6-trinitrophenyl linked to the hydrophilic polysaccharide Ficoll) (Supplementary Fig. 4k ). As the Ccl19 promoter was also active in Peyer's patches 19 ( Supplementary  Fig. 5a) , we investigated the fate of Peyer's patches following the ablation of FRCs. Systemic administration of DTxn elicited less substantial disruption of populations in Peyer's patches than in the spleen or lymph nodes, with smaller reductions in the number of FRCs and B cells than those in the spleen or lymph nodes ( Supplementary  Fig. 5b,c) . Similarly, we observed no major anatomical alterations, with the exception of a paucity of T cell clusters in interfollicular regions (Supplementary Fig. 5d ). Together these observations indicated an unanticipated regulation of B cell homeostasis by FRCs and suggested that damage to the FRC network had deleterious consequences on the cellular circuitries that underpin humoral responses.",

            "text": "Lymph node FRCs support the homing and survival of B cells Given the reported role of FRCs in regulating the trafficking of cells of the immune system 6, 7, 9, 26 , we hypothesized that the decrease in B cell numbers after the ablation of FRCs might have stemmed from impaired homing of lymphocytes to lymph nodes. To test this hypothesis, we labeled congenic B cells with the division-tracking dye CFSE and adoptively transferred the cells into DTxn-treated Ccl19-Cre \u00d7 iDTR mice, then counted the transferred cells in lymph nodes 90 min and 24 h later by flow cytometry. Donor B cell numbers were markedly reduced at both time points in the lymph nodes of mice in which FRCs were ablated (Supplementary Fig. 6a) . The homing of B cells to lymph nodes depends on the chemokines CCL19 and CXCL12 (ref. 27) , and Cxcl12 expression in FRCs has been documented 8 . Indeed, Cxcl12 expression was considerably reduced in mice in which FRCs were ablated (Supplementary Fig. 6b) , and FRCs were sufficient to elicit B cell chemotaxis in vitro (Supplementary Fig. 6c) , which suggested that FRCs recruited B cells, possibly via CXCL12 and CCL19. Notably, blockade of lymphocyte ingress (via treatment with an antibody that blocks the lymph node-homing receptor CD62L) was not sufficient to appreciably perturb B cell numbers in the first 24 h after treatment (Supplementary Fig. 6d) , in contrast to the rapid B cell loss observed in mice in which FRCs were ablated (Fig. 5a,b) . Additionally, preventing the egress of lymphocytes from lymph nodes with FTY720 (an antagonist of the receptor for sphingosine 1-phosphate) did not completely restore B cell numbers following ablation of FRCs (Supplementary Fig. 6e ). Together these data suggested that while B cell entry required an intact FRC network, impaired B cell trafficking accounted for only part of the reduction in B cell numbers following the ablation of FRCs. That consideration prompted us to investigate the possibility that FRCs might regulate additional aspects of B cell homeostasis. Consistent with this hypothesis, B cell loss in mice in which FRCs were ablated coincided with a significant increase in propidium iodide-positive B cells (Fig. 6a,b) , which linked FRCs to the promotion of B cell survival.",

Thus, we reasoned that the phenotypes of mice in which FRCs were ablated might have been secondary to a decrease in the abundance or function of FDCs. To determine if FDCs were directly targeted in our system, we ascertained whether the Ccl19 promoter was active in FDCs in situ by fluorescence imaging of Ccl19-Cre \u00d7 Rosa26-eYFP mice. As shown by staining of the FDC marker FDCM1 and CXCL13, eYFP was absent from most FDCs in steady-state lymph nodes (Fig. 6d) . We detected less staining of eYFP in a small number of FDCM1 + processes (Fig. 6d) , possibly due to the tight interconnections that exist between FRCs and FDCs in follicles 4, 32 . Additionally, to investigate the status of FDCs in mice in which FRCs were ablated, we assessed lymph nodes by quantitative microscopy at various time points after the administration of DTxn. Our data demonstrated that FDCs were present 24 h after such treatment ( Fig. 6e; quantification, Fig. 6f) , despite profound loss of FRCs (Fig. 2c) . Furthermore, FDCs remained functionally competent at this time point, as demonstrated by their ability to correctly display exogenous immunocomplexes (Supplementary Fig. 7a) . Prolonged exposure to DTxn led to a progressive reduction in FDC volume, as shown by a decrease in the integrated intensity of FDCM1 staining (Fig. 6e,f) and decreased CD35 staining as well (data not shown).",

BAFF + cells were characterized by the expression of several canonical markers of FRCs, including PDPN, \u03b1-smooth muscle actin, CD44, cadherin-11, CD140\u03b1 and CD140\u03b2, VCAM (the endothelial ligand for integrin \u03b1 4 \u03b2 1 ) and fibroblast-activation protein (Fig. 7c) , which supported the proposal that these cells were nearly identical to FRCs. Thus, our data suggested that FRCs positioned in follicular regions contributed to B cell homeostasis by providing the prosurvival factor BAFF. To directly test that hypothesis, we cultured B cells in the presence or absence of FRCs and measured B cell viability by staining the cells with propidium iodide, followed by flow cytometry. Notably, B cells cultured in the presence of FRCs exhibited significantly greater viability than that of B cells cultured alone (Fig. 7d) . The elevated number of propidium iodide-negative B220 + cells in cultures with FRCs could not be accounted for by proliferation ( Supplementary  Fig. 7f) . To ascertain whether the survival advantage conferred by FRCs was due to a soluble factor, we cultured B cells with stromal cells in separate compartments of a Transwell chamber or with FRCconditioned medium. In both conditions, B cells exhibited enhanced viability (Fig. 7e) , which indicated the presence of a soluble prosurvival factor derived from FRCs. Next we sought to determine whether the prosurvival factor contributed by FRCs was BAFF. For this, we preincubated FRC-conditioned medium with a BAFF-specific blocking antibody before adding the medium to B cells. Strikingly, the npg enhancement of B cell survival was largely abrogated following neutralization of BAFF (Fig. 7f) . In sum, our data have described a subset of FRCs that delineated the borders of B cell follicles in lymph nodes (FRCs in the B cell zone) and nurtured B cells through the production of BAFF (Supplementary Fig. 8) .",

The generation of Ccl19-Cre mice has provided a solution to this technological limitation 19 . In particular, cell type-specific expression of DTR allowed us to assess the functional outcomes of disrupting the FRC network in physiological settings. The ablation of FRCs caused a substantial reduction in T cell numbers in resting lymph nodes and marked impairment in antigen-specific T cell responses. Unexpectedly, the ablation of FRCs was not immediately accompanied by collapse of the structured conduit system, which suggested that the lymph node infrastructure can persist and function despite a lack of support from stromal cells. In contrast, the absence of the cellular source of the reticular network (i.e., FRCs) affected the dynamics and function of T cells, which demonstrated that FRCs were essential for optimal T cell immunity but not for the short-term maintenance of the conduit system.",

While most lymph node FRCs reside in the T cell-rich paracortex, some localize to the vicinity of follicular conduits near the subcapsular sinus 4,32 . Our identification of Ccl19-Cre + cells in B cell follicles (FRCs in the B cell zone) confirmed that FRCs span both the inner regions and the outer regions of the lymph node 33 . Unexpectedly, we found that FRCs in the B cell zone constituted a nonredundant source of BAFF. The source of BAFF in secondary lymphoid organs has been identified as a radioresistant cell 30 often attributed to FDCs. That concept has been confounded, however, by reports that abrogation of signaling via the receptor for lymphotoxin\u03b2, which is critical for the development and maintenance of FDCs, does not affect BAFF expression or B cell numbers [34] [35] [36] [37] . Further, a Cd21-Cre system for the conditional ablation of FDCs has provided evidence that these cells are dispensable for BAFF expression and the survival of naive B cells 17 . Although the possibility that FDCs contribute to BAFF production and their ablation induces compensatory upregulation by other cells cannot be excluded, these studies collectively have indicated an alternate source of BAFF in resting lymph nodes. On the basis of our data, we propose that FRCs in the B cell zone represent this source of BAFF and thereby directly support B cell homeostasis. The disrupted follicular organization in mice in which FRCs were ablated may have also contributed to decreased B cell survival, as FRCs in intact lymphoid organs would coordinate the migration of naive B cells from high endothelial venules to BAFFrich follicles. Furthermore, while ablation of FRCs did not appear to impede the flow of lymph through the lymph node conduit network, it may have affected the ability of migratory dendritic cells to deliver tissue-derived antigens to T cells and B cells and thus may have contributed to the diminished antibody production observed in Ccl19-Cre \u00d7 iDTR mice. Collectively, our findings indicated that alterations in lymph node stromal composition can have catastrophic consequences on immunological competence, with decreased lymphocyte viability and disorganized spatial organization of T cell and B cell responses.",

In this context, stromal cells are thought to arise from a primordial mesenchyme in the lymph node anlagen, which initially develops into lymphoid tissue-organizer cells 38 . Colonization by B lymphocytes and T lymphocytes after birth then promotes the development of conventional stromal subsets. The similar pattern of expression of cellular markers by MRCs and lymphoid tissue-organizer cells suggests that MRCs differentiate into FRCs and FDCs and continuously supply additional stromal subsets 18 . If indeed FRCs arise from MRCs in adult lymph nodes, then the Ccl19 promoter must be silenced in MRCs. Furthermore, our studies indicated that most FDCs were devoid of promoter activity and should thus be refractory to DTxn-induced apoptosis. A few cell processes from FDCM1 + cells displayed weak positivity for eYFP. However, given the tight association between FRCs and FDCs in follicles 4,32 , it remains difficult to discern between true promoter activity in these FDCs and proximity to eYFP + FRCs in follicular regions. In this context, we observed functionally competent FDCs early after the administration of DTxn, when profound loss of FRCs had already occurred, which suggested that FDCs were not directly targeted in this system. Consequently, the decrease in staining of FDCM1 at later time points, probably mediated by contraction or de-differentiation of the FDC network, may have arisen from as-yet-unrecognized crosstalk between FRCs and FDCs. Our finding that contraction of the FDC network was transient and was rapidly followed by a regeneration phase is notable. One potential explanation for this is that damage to the FDC network, secondary to FRC loss, may induce MRCs to generate new FDCM1 + cells 39 .",

However, they differed in their localization, and we did not find BAFF-producing cells in T cell areas. As mesenchymal cells are typically highly flexible in nature, depending on the surrounding environment, it is possible that BAFF production by FRCs in the B cell zone is maintained by microanatomical cues. Several functions associated with T cell immunity have been assigned to FRCs [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] 9, 19, 26, 40 , yet the requirement for these cells in humoral responses has not been addressed.

Influenza virus was propagated and isolated as described 25 . 3 d after the administration of DTxn, mice were given adoptive transfer of 5 \u00d7 10 6 CFSE-labeled, purified OT-II CD4 + T cells by injection into the tail vein. 24 h later, mice received 20 \u00b5l viral suspension (1 \u00d7 10 6 plaque-forming units) by subcutaneous injection into the footpad. Mice were killed 24 h later and popliteal lymph nodes were analyzed by flow cytometry. Activation and CFSE dilution were determined 60 h after T cell transfer. For the coronavirus experiments, DTxn was injected 72 h before adoptive transfer of T cells 23 . A total of 2 \u00d7 10 6 TCR-S CD8 + T cells were transferred by intravenous injection and, 12 h after transfer, mice were given subcutaneous injection (into both flanks) of 3 \u00d7 10 6 nonreplicating coronaviral particles 23 . Mice were given a second injection of nonreplicating coronaviral particles 12 h after the first injection. Lymph nodes were analyzed 72 h after the first injection of viral particles.

Additionally, serum was collected for analysis of influenza virus-specific antibodies. For enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) of serum, influenza virus strain PR8 that had undergone ultraviolet irradiation was immobilized on a plate with high binding capacity, followed by the addition of collected serum and probing for specific binding of IgM or IgG2b (Sigma) by standard alkaline-phosphatase development. For experiments involving immunization with TNP-Ficoll, mice were given injection of DTxn and, 2 d later, were given intraperitoneal injection of TNP-Ficoll (250 \u00b5g per mouse). IgM antibody titers in the blood were determined at day 8.Treatment with anti-CD62L and FTY720. For blockade of CD62L, mice received one single intraperitoneal dose of anti-CD62L (200 \u00b5g per mouse; MEL-14; BioXcell). For the prevention of cell egress, mice were given intraperitoneal injection of FTY720 (1 mg per kg body weight; Fingolimod; R&D Systems) and, 4 h later, were given injection DTxn. Mice received an additional dose of FTY720 at 48 h and were killed for analysis at 72 h. BAFF in serum. Serum was collected from mice 3 d after the administration of DTxn and were stored at \u221280 \u00b0C until processing. Soluble BAFF was measured in the serum samples at a dilution of 1:2 with a modified cytometric bead array. BD CBA Functional Beads (BD Biosciences) were activated and were coated with ImmunoPure streptavidin according to the manufacturer's instructions (Thermo Scientific). For array development, a commercial anti-BAFF ELISA kit (DY2106-05; R&D Systems) was used. Biotinylated detection antibody was incubated with 30 \u00b5l of streptavidin-conjugated bead slurry at a concentration of 3 \u00b5g/ml and was subsequently washed three times with PBS containing 3% FBS. Following overnight blockade of nonspecific binding, serum samples were incubated for 2 h with anti-BAFF beads in Multiscreen plates (Millipore). Beads were then washed three times with 3% FBS in PBS. ELISA capture antibody was used for the detection of BAFF bound to beads at a concentration of 4 \u00b5g/ml. Following 1 h of incubation, beads were washed, followed by incubation for 1 h with Alexa Fluor 546-conjugated goat anti-rat (a-11081; Molecular Probes). Beads were washed three times with 3% FBS in PBS, followed by an additional four washes in PBS alone. Fluorescence was detected on a FACSAria IIu (BD), and data were analyzed with FlowJo software.",
