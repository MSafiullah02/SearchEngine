The prevalence of CMV seropositivity in human populations is roughly 50\u201395% [2\u20134] and highest amongst older people [5]. Cytomegalovirus infection induces innate immune responses (eg. natural killer cells) and adaptive immunity (eg. CD4+/CD8+ T cells). However, the virus can evade host detection by expressing genes that interfere with both the innate and adaptive immune systems. Eventually, CMV is able to establish latency in which either the host fails to eliminate the virus or the virus cannot replicate. However, CMV can become reactivated during periods of host immune suppression [6].",

A previous meta-analysis published in 2009 demonstrated that CMV infection was associated with a higher mortality rate, nearly twice that observed in patients without CMV infection [29]. However, this study did not consider the influence of antiviral drugs on clinical outcomes. Moreover, many clinical studies about CMV have been reported in recent years. Thus, to acquire a better understanding of the potential role of CMV infection in contributing to mortality in critically ill patients, especially those not receiving antiviral agents and CMV detected in blood, we performed a meta-analysis of data available in the literature, focusing on the outcome in immunocompetent ICU patients with CMV infection.",

The median period of prospective studies was 24 months, ranging broadly from 3 to 78 months. All studies used CMV blood assays, and 6 studies also assayed sputum samples. Most studies indicated that the frequency of sample collection was once a week. In our analysis, the methods used to assess CMV infection were virus culture, pp65 antigen detection and PCR detection of CMV DNA in ten, three and two studies, respectively, and combinations of two diagnostic methods in the remaining three studies.",

Polymerase chain reaction has been demonstrated to be the most sensitive method of CMV detection [34], but even so, the CMV infection rate may still be underestimated because we chose only the studies containing 2 \u00d7 2 tables on CMV results and all-cause mortality. We excluded studies where either the rate of CMV infection or mortality was zero and we also excluded some studies with a 0% infection rate that used early monitoring of CMV, often fewer than 7 days after admission to the ICU [26, 35\u201337].

Desachy et al. demonstrated that positive results for CMV infection were obtained in a median of 4 days by PCR compared with 11 days by pp65 antigen detection after onset of sepsis [36]. Therefore, PCR facilitates earlier diagnosis of an episode of CMV infection than any other method. We then analyzed the association between CMV positivity and mortality, stratified by detection method. We also found that patients with CMV infection detected by PCR had higher mortality than patients without CMV infection (OR: 2.07, 95% CI 1.59\u20132.70, I2 = 40%, n = 1441). However, when compared with other methods, the association with mortality was marginally less strong using PCR. We may think that viral burden of CMV is determinant of pathogenesis, and higher CMV loads is correlated with progression of some CMV infection disease [39, 40].",

There are several factors that might explain the high prevalence. First of all, the rate of CMV seropositivity increases with advancing age [5] and in our analysis, the median age was 59 years. Second, to inhibit the reactivation of CMV, as many as 10% of all peripheral CD4+ and CD8+ T cells are constantly required for immune surveillance to maintain functional latency [41]. Sepsis is associated with immunoparalysis, as apoptosis of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells is increased [42, 43]. Furthermore, some patients in the ICU may be immunosuppressed after trauma and major surgery [44]. In addition, treatments commonly received in the ICU, such as massive transfusion, corticosteroids, or catecholamines may transiently compromise host immunity [45]. It has also been reported that the use of heart-lung machines can lead to temporary systemic immunosuppression [46]. Therefore, patients in the ICU may show transient immunoparalysis [47], potentially resulting in the observed CMV reactivation. Third, some inflammatory cytokines including tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukin-1\u03b2, can stimulate reactivation of latent CMV [48]. Thus, significant numbers of immunocompetent patients harboring latent virus are susceptible to CMV reactivation during critical illness.",

This maybe explained that the presence of high peripheral levels of functional CMV-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in immunocompetent patients, which can suppress CMV during episodes of reactivation [26]. It was observed that CMV infection was not associated with mortality in CMV colitis. In steroid-refractory patients with ulcerative colitis, CMV was found in the colon by histopathology, which is also not associated with adverse clinical outcomes [49]. Indeed, there has been no research to demonstrate that immunocompetent critically patients with CMV infection could benefit from antivirus therapy. And there are a number of side effects of antiviral drugs, such as hematologic complications (neutropenia, anemia and thrombocytopenia), renal dysfunction, mental disorders [50]. Therefore, giving antiviral drugs to critically ill patients should be considered cautiously in terms of advantage-disadvantage ratio. To address this issue, there are two ongoing, blinded, randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials of an antiviral drug with activity against CMV in critically ill patients in the ICU (NCT 01335932, NCT 02152358).",

However, little or no heterogeneity was observed in the meta-analysis of mortality outcome. Second, most studies were not blind, thus reducing the reliability of the results. Third, lack of sufficient data on clinical parameters (eg: severity of illness, cause of ICU admission, comorbidity) meant that stratified analyses based on such clinical characteristics were not possible. Fourth, the definition of the state of CMV infection was inconsistent and maybe restrictive to capture the dynamics of CMV infection. As such, we could not conduct meta-analysis with outcome data and this is a major limitation of our meta-analysis. Finally, one [10] cannot discount the effect of unmeasured confounders given the observational nature of the body of evidence comprising this meta-analysis.",
