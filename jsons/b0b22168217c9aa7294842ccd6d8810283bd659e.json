            "text": "Michael A. Graham Sudden and unexpected natural deaths and nonnatural deaths may result from various pulmonary conditions. Additionally, several nonpulmonary conditions of forensic significance may be complicated by the development of respiratory lesions. Certain situations with pulmonary pathology are particularly likely to be critically scrutinized and may form the basis of allegations of medical negligence, other personal injury liability, or wrongful death. l The forensic evaluation of lethal or nonlethal conditions is essentially the same and conceptually differs little from a clinician's approach to a patient with a similar condition (Table 31 .1). In some cases this diagnostic/investigative process is quite broad, whereas in other cases the issues are of very limited scope and the investigation may be narrowly focused. The pathologist may playa critical role in these evaluations, not only by addressing the abovenoted issues, but also by documenting pertinent findings that other experts may rely on in formulating their opinions; properly recognizing, collecting, preserving, and transmitting physical evidence; and presenting findings and opinions in appropriate legal forums.",

In other cases, the cause of disease or injury, timing of lesions, establishing the presence or extent of lesions and any response to therapy, evaluating modifying or contributory factors to death or disability, or correlating findings with antemortem activity or condition may be at issue.

Commonly, there is confusion about the meanings and use of these terms as they apply to medicolegal death investigation and death certification. 1174 The cause of death is the disease or injury that begins the unbroken pathophysiologic sequence leading to death. The disease/injury that causes death at a particular time is often referred to as the immediate cause of death. The disease/injury that starts the unbroken chain of medical events culminating in death is referred to as the underlying cause of death. Proper recognition of the latter is very important for death certification, epidemiology, public policy, and the proper resolution of criminal justice and civil liability issues. 2 The mechanism of death is the nonspecific pathophysiologic alteration through which the cause of death exerts its lethal influence. The manner of death is a term peculiar to death certification that describes how death came about-through natural causes, homicide, suicide, or accident. 2 The determination of the manner of death is heavily dependent on the investigation of the circumstances surrounding the death or, if death is delayed, the illness or injury ultimately responsible for death. In some cases the information will not enable a clear determination to be made, and a classification of undetermined may be warranted.",

An increased risk of death has been associated with a variety of epidemiologic and clinical risk factors?! Fatal episodes of asthma characteristically occur in patients with preexisting diagnoses of asthma (95%), have their onset at home (56%), and demonstrate a nocturnal predilection. 22 . 23 Several studies have failed to demonstrate a constant seasonal characteristic in fatal asthma. 22 ,24-26 However, other studies have reported age-specific seasonal variation and some correlation with high mold spore counts. 2 ? Metered-dose inhalers (MDIs) are often present at the scene of an asthmatic fatality and may be found in the hand or adjacent to the body of the decedent. In some cases, evidence of the recent use of a beta-blocker may offer insight into what precipitated the terminal attack, [28] [29] [30] [31] Overall, among patients dying of asthma there appears to be at least two subgroups that have different clinical and pathologic features. 32 ,33 In one group, the fatal incident is of slow onset with progressive clinical deterioration that typically lasts in excess of 2V2 hours. 32 These patients, the slow-onset group, typically have a history of severe asthma, poor overall control of their disease and prolonged symptoms prior to coming for medical care during the terminal attack. Among a series of asthma deaths in Cardiff, only one third were associated with attacks lasting longer than 8 hours. 34 The other group of patients succumbing to asthma, the sudden-onset group, constitutes approximately 25% of fatalities, These individuals characteristically have the sudden onset of the fatal attack and die within an hour of its onset. In the Cardiff series of asthmatic fatalities, one fourth of the deaths occurred within 30 minutes of the onset of the terminal episode. 34 These persons often do not have a history of prior control problems and some have been demonstrated to have had normal airflow rates shortly prior to the onset of their lethal attack, They have a propensity to experience respiratory arrest. 32 It is this group that is most often seen by medical examiners.",

An increased number of basophils 51 have also been reported in some asthma fatalities, as have neutrophils. 52 The nature of the inflammatory infiltrate helps characterize the two subgroups. The number of eosinophils in the submucosa correlates with the duration of the terminal attack. Immunofluorescent studies of a series of asthma fatalities among a medical examiner office patient population demonstrated a smaller number of eosinophils and a larger number of neutrophils in the bronchial submucosa of sudden-onset episodes when compared to slow-onset cases. 36 It has been postulated that the increased neutrophil population may be due to the release of neutrophil chemotactic factors after antigen or bacterial endotoxin inhalation. 36 Desquamation of bronchial columnar epithelial cells is also commonly observed in the lungs of persons dying of asthma, and, as previously noted, epithelial cells are often a component of mucous plugs. 21 Whether or not the epithelial desquamation seen in postmortem lung sections represents an intravitam phenomenon or a histologic artifact has been questioned?l While some believe it is a histologic artifact, there are substantial findings that are supportive of it being an antemortem event, such as the incorporation of the epithelial cells into the mucin plug, their presence in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) specimens and sputum (Creola bodies),53 and the observation of regenerative changes in the residual intact epithelium. 41 While it is clear that epithelial denudation is a relatively common histologic artifact, the finding of the epithelial cells in the proper context incorporated throughout the mucous plug, along with the other observations previously noted, helps in the proper interpretation of a particular case.",

Fatal anaphylaxis precipitated by allergen immunotherapy occurs at an estimated rate of 1 case per 2 million injections. No triggering agent is identifiable in approximately 25% to 33% of anaphylaxis cases. 55 Triggers for IgE-independent reactions (anaphylactoid reactions) include, among others, radiocontrast media, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor administered during renal dialysis, opioids, immune aggregates, exercise, and temperature (hot, cold). 62, 63 Regardless of whether the reaction is IgE mediated or not, the clinical syndrome of \"anaphylaxis\" results from the effects of the release of a variety of mast cell/basophil mediators-primarily histamine. Serum histamine concentrations correlate with the severity of cardiopulmonary and gastrointestinal manifestations but not with the formation of urticaria. 64 ,65 Other mediators that are released include serotonin, ~-tryptase, chymase, heparin, cytokines, and leukotrienes. 57 The clinical severity of any particular attack is not predictable. Although the severity of the reaction is usually dose dependent, exposures to small amounts of antigen can precipitate severe attacks in highly sensitized individuals.",

Peak plasma concentration of tryptase occurs in 1 to 2 hours and declines with a half-life of 2 hours. 73 Plasma concentration of tryptase, especially ~-tryptase (the form stored in cytoplasmic granules), correlates with the clinical severity of anaphylaxis. The demonstration of an elevated plasma tryptase concentration in a blood sample obtained during life is highly specific for anaphylaxis. 70 The interpretation of tryptase concentrations in postmortem blood samples is not so straightforward. n Elevated concentrations of blood tryptase have been demonstrated in nearly 90% of anaphylaxis fatalities. However, elevated blood tryptase concentrations have also been found in postmortem samples obtained from persons whose deaths were not attributed to anaphylaxis,70 including cases with chest trauma and arteriosclerotic cardiovascular disease. 7o ,n. Randall et al. 70 reported elevated (greater than 1 ng/ml) blood tryptase concentrations in 63% of nonanaphylaxis deaths (31 of 49) with two of the cases (4%) measuring 5.1 to 10ng/mL and five cases (10%) being >10ng/mL). A study of 193 postmortem cases demonstrated a sensitivity of 86% and specificity of 88% when a 10-ng/mL concentration cutoff was used. 74 Normal postmortem concentrations may be seen in anaphylaxis deaths when death is very rapid and when death ensues after a prolonged survival interval.",

In addition, elevated IgE has been reported in the settings of trauma, sepsis, and other nonatopic conditions. 72 As with many other entities causing sudden unexpected death, there is no \"magic bullet\" establishing the diagnosis of fatal anaphylaxis. Arriving at the correct diagnosis requires a high index of suspicion coupled with careful clinicopathologic correlation. 7 ! Primary Pulmonary Hypertension Primary (idiopathic) pulmonary arterial hypertension (PPH) is a condition characterized by sustained elevations of pulmonary arterial pressure ( exceeding 25 mm Hg at rest or exceeding 30 mm Hg with exercise) without a demonstrable cause. 79 , 80 The pathogenesis of increased pulmonary vascular resistance in patients with PPH involves vasoconstriction, vascular wall remodeling, and in situ thrombosis. A variety of conditions with similar clinical and pathologic features to PPH have been identified. 8l Primary pulmonary hypertension is typically a disease of young women 82 ,83 with an incidence of 1 to 2 per million persons in the general population. 84 ,85 Familial cases accounted for 6% of cases in a National Institutes of Health (NIH) registry.79 Sudden death is a relatively common manifestation of this entity, occurring in 7% of cases,8! and, uncommonly, may be its initial presentation. 82 ,86 Sudden death may be precipitated by stress that would ordinarily be considered inconsequential.

No risk factor was recognized in 14% of these deaths. 105 Occasional cases of PTE have been ascribed to some inherited form of thrombophilia. In a series of 34 PTE deaths selected for molecular screening (80% selected due to age <45 years), three were found to be heterozygous for the prothrombin G20lOA mutation and one for factor V Leiden mutation. An additional eight cases were heterozygous and one was homozygous for mutation of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR). 95 The root of most inherited thrombophilias is impaired thrombin neutralization or failure to control thrombin generation. \\06 The former is characteristic of antithrombin deficiency and the latter is associated with deficiencies of protein S or protein C or the presence of factor V Leiden or prothrombin G20210A mutations. \\07 More than half of inherited thrombophilias are due to factor V Leiden mutations and, to a lesser extent, the prothrombin G202lOA mutation. The heterozygote state for factor V Leiden mutation has a sevenfold increased risk for the development of DVT, whereas the risk in the homozygote is increased 100 times. lo8 The heterozygous state for the prothrombin G20210A mutation carries an increased risk for DVT/PTE of about 4. Mutation of MTHFR is very common (heterozygous in 40% to 50% of Caucasians) but is of uncertain clinical significance. It does not appear to confer independent risk for the development of DVT/PTE. Any increased risk associated with this mutation appears to be dependent on serum folate and Bl2 concentrations. 95 Inherited thrombophilia should be considered in recurrent episodes of DVT/PTE, a family history of DVT/PTE, age less than 45 years, \"soft\" or inapparent risk factors, or a history of multiple second-or third-trimester stillbirths/ abortions. In these cases, an antemortem or postmortem molecular thrombin profile should be considered. 107 Deep venous thrombosis predominately arises in the veins of the lower extremities, most often starting in the calf veins.lo9 In 10% to 20% of cases the thrombus extends proximally. Fatal PTE occurs in 1 % to 5%? A significant number of these deaths are sudden. Nearly 75% of PTE deaths occur within the first 24 hours after the embolism, with one third of them occurring in the initial hour. 110 The incidence of fatal PTE can be decreased through the use of preventative therapy.",

Although many cases of sudden death occur in ambulatory patients without previous disease or injury, a substantial number will arise in or out of the hospital during convalescence from some other disease or injury. In these cases, it is essential that the underlying condition complicated by the development of DVT/PTE be recognized so that the underlying cause of death may be accurately identified and the death certified appropriately. This may have profound effects on the decedent's estate, insurance, and civil or criminal legal proceedings. For example, a person lying in a hospital bed for 2 weeks during recovery from a pelvic fracture sustained in a motor vehicle crash develops lethal DVT/PTE.

The thrombus may show the configuration of the sinuses of the venous valves where it formed. There may be a corrugated or ridged appearance of parts of the thrombus where the lines of Zahn come to the surface. A thrombus is typically firm, fills the lumen, and may distend the vessel (Fig. 31.13 ). In contrast, most clots do not fill the vessel; they conform to the pattern of the vessel, often have distinct cellular and coagulated liquid components (\"cranberry jelly\" and \"chicken fat\"), and tend to be soft and easily compressed.! Differentiation of thrombus from thromboembolus can be difficult. An in situ thrombus is not coiled on itself, whereas a thromboembolus may be. In addition, a large pulmonary artery thrombosis typically is associated with underlying destructive lung disease (see Fig. 28 .32 in Chapter 28). In some cases it may be possible to trace the thrombus to an area of parenchymal destruction and frequently demonstrate the presence of endarteritis obliterans. lls Determining the age of a thromboembolus is a common medicolegal problem. In essence, there are two issues in 1183 this determination: the age of the thrombus and the age of the embolization (see Table 28 .7 in Chapter 28). In general, the dating of a thrombus depends on an assessment of the degree of preservation of the original constituents of the thrombus and the degree of organization of the thrombus by ingrowth of mesenchymal elements from the tissue underlying the thrombus at its site of origin. Mononuclear blood cells in the thrombus may also playa role in organization. These cells multiply by mitosis and differentiate into macrophages, endothelial cells, fibroblasts, and smooth muscle cells. 116 The consequences of this organization may vary depending on the site at which the thrombus forms.",

It is reasonable to expect that a thrombus remaining at the site of origin will acquire ingrowth of mesenchymal cells, become mechanically attached to the site, and be less capable of embolizing as time passes. Experience with cases of rapidly fatal pulmonary thromboemboli suggests that most such thrombi (or at least a segment of a thrombus) had formed within at most a few days prior to their embolization.! Thromboemboli resolve by fibrinolysis, retraction, and organization. The sequential process of organization by mesenchymal cells from the pulmonary artery at the site of lodgment lends itself to age assessment. Dating of an embolus is most reliably accomplished by demonstrating and assessing attachment of the embolus to the pulmonary arterial wall. To best accomplish this, it is important for the pathologist to identify and sample points of adherence between the embolus and the vessel wall in order to FIGURE 31. 14. Organizing pulmonary thromboembolus with fibrous attachment to intimal surface.

            "text": "In general, the vasa vasorum at the point of thromboembolus lodgment is dilated, and fibrin is deposited on the surface of the thromboembolus within a few hours of impaction. By 24 hours, the adjacent pulmonary artery media is edematous and infiltrated by neutrophils, and there are endothelial cells on the surface of the embolus (see Figs. 28.23 and 28.24 in Chapter 28). Fibrous tissue at the point of attachment and endothelial-lined channels are seen by 7 days (Fig. 31 .14). The thromboembolus, especially one in a smaller conducting artery, shows extensive fibrosis in 2 to 3 weeks. Final resolution may result in a fibrous plug within the lumen that mayor may not recanalize ( Fig. 31 .15A), incorporation into the artery wall resulting in a fibrous intimal plaque, or formation of a fibrous band or web ( Fig. 31 .15B; see also Fig. 28.11 in Chapter 28) . Complete resolution can occur in 2 to 3 weeks, with 60% completely resolved within 4 months after a major embolic event. I1O Pulmonary artery thromboemboli are less commonly seen in muscular arteries, but the sequence of organization appears similar to that in elastic arteries. ll7 The shear force of flowing blood maintains the lining cells of the cardiovascular system in a flattened state. When this shear force is reduced or eliminated, the cells round up and proliferate. With thrombosis, the shear effect of the flowing blood is lost, and the lining cells are free to proliferate into the overlying thrombus. This organization begins as a loose network of proliferating mesenchymal cells, becomes vascular granulation tissue, and later becomes dense scar that may be recanalized (see Fig. 28 .24 in Chapter 28). If the surface of the thrombus becomes endothelialized, it will mature into dense connective tissue. If the surface does not endo-thelialize, the thrombus will continue to accumulate new thrombotic material on its surface. Thus, in cardiac or aortic aneurysms, it is common to see thrombus that is months to years old in the deepest parts adjacent to the wall, and only hours to days of age on the surface exposed to the flowing blood. A similar phenomenon may be seen in elastic pulmonary arteries, where thromboemboli may be associated with damage to the arterial wall and aneurysm formation. The mechanical impact of the thromboembolus may acutely stretch and damage the vessel wall, which then dilates to form an aneurysm. The morphologic appearance is that of advanced organization adjacent to the vessel wall and superficial fresh thrombus on the luminal surface.! Most pulmonary artery thromboemboli, even those that are occlusive, do not produce infarction of the pulmonary parenchyma. When a thrombus occludes a pulmonary artery branch, the bronchial circulation is usually able to supply adequate blood flow to the involved parenchyma through collateral connections. If a person having left-sided congestive heart failure sustains a pulmonary artery thromboembolus, flow through the bronchial collaterals may be inhibited and the lung tissue may infarct (see Chapter 28) .",

Fatty acids are toxic to endothelial cells and pneumocytes. 124 In addition, interleukin-6 (IL-6) may be responsible for the fever that is commonly seen in FES. 124 The IL-6 may be due to increased production of tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a) and IL-l~, possibly related to injury to soft tissue. 124 Pulmonary fat embolism can be seen in hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained sections of lung tissue ( Fig.  31.16 ). Fat can also be visualized using special stains. A number of special staining techniques, each with advantages and disadvantages, have been described. Perhaps the classic special staining technique for fat embolism is the use of oil red 0 on frozen sections of lung tissue (Fig. 31.17) . This technique is plagued with poor tissue detail and displacement of the fat due to lack of lipid immobilization during processing.147 Fixation of lung tissue with osmic acid has also been proposed as a method for demonstrating fat in paraffin-embedded tissue. This method is expensive, has poor tissue penetration, uses toxic reagents, and fails to reveal saturated fats.147 More recently, an inexpensive, although slow (due to long waiting steps), staining method using chromic/linoleic acid has been described. 147 Whereas the presence of PFE can be confirmed by demonstrating fat globules within the pulmonary vasculature, the diagnosis of FES requires clinical information. Most FES diagnostic criteria require involvement of at least two of the three major organ/tissue systems, as previously described. 124 , 125 The diagnostic utility of seeing fat in bronchoalveolar cells obtained by BAL is unclear. 125.148 Similarly, the diagnostic significance of seeing fat in pulmonary microvascular (PMV) cytology samples is not resolved.125. [149] [150] [151] Air Embolism Air embolism (AE), even though infrequently clinically significant, occurs in a variety of well-recognized scenarios. It is important to distinguish between venous air embolism and arterial air embolism because these two forms of AE have different routes of access to the circulatory system, pathologic findings, clinical manifestations, and therapeutic implications. 125 Venous air embolism arises when air is introduced into the systemic venous circulation and is allowed to travel through the circulation to the right heart and then to the pulmonary arterial system. Rarely, it arises when air is introduced directly into the right ventricle or pulmonary artery. Venous air embolism has also been associated with rapid decompression. 152 Clinically significant venous air embolism requires a relatively large amount of air. The effects of venous air embolism are primarily seen in the lungs. 125 Arterial air embolism arises from air being introduced into the pulmonary venous circulation, then traveling to the left heart and into the systemic arterial circulation. On occasion, air in the systemic venous or pulmonary arterial systems may enter the systemic arterial system M.A. Graham through a right to left shunt (e.g., patent foramen ovale or pulmonary arteriovenous malformation [AVM]) or by overwhelming the filtering capacity of the lung. 125 A minuscule amount of air in the systemic arterial circulation may potentially have catastrophic effects. The effects of arterial air embolism are primarily observed in extrapulmonary organs, typically the heart and brain.! 25 The remainder of this section concentrates on venous air embolism.",

Significant clinical dysfunction or death requires a large venous air embolism unless arterial air embolism supervenes. The minimal amount of air that needs to be infused to be lethal is not clearly established. However, assessment of multiple observed cases suggests that 200 to 300mL of air rapidly infused is sufficient to cause the deaths of at least some persons.158-161 Others have opined that death can occur with the rapid infusion of as little as 100mL of air. 162 The pathogenesis of dysfunction induced by venous air embolism is complex and involves a number of factors including mechanical obstruction to blood flow, pre-and postcapillary vasoconstriction, air/blood interactioninduced particulates, and pulmonary leukocytes. 125 The clinical onset is typically sudden. It may be immediate or, less frequently, delayed. The symptoms and signs are for the most part nonspecific. Dyspnea is common. 163 Other manifestations may include evidence of central nervous system dysfunction, fainting, light-headedness, chest pain, and anxiety. There may be evidence of hemo-dynamic compromise. The specific mill wheel murmur may be heard but, even in cases in which it is present, it tends to be transient. Instead, heart sounds are usually normal or include a harsh systolic murmur. 125 Venous air embolism is recognized at autopsy by the presence of a large quantity of air in the undissected venous system, right heart ( Fig. 31.18 ), or pulmonary artery. In clinically significant cases of AE, the blood in the right ventricle and pulmonary artery is typically frothy. Air bubbles may be seen along the route the air traveled from the ingress point to the right heart. Postmortem radiography may be useful in demonstrating the air ( Fig. 31.19 ).164 Special dissection techniques may also facilitate the autopsy demonstration of AE.I64 Baker 165 has described a relatively simple dissection technique in which the heart is isolated and the coronary arteries, cardiac chambers, pulmonary artery, pulmonary veins, and vena cavae are sequentially opened in situ while submerged in water. l64 Alternatively, entrapped air in the right ventricle may be demonstrated by the appearance of air bubbles entering a large airtight syringe half filled with water when the syringe needle is introduced into the right ventricle. 166 Other techniques for collecting and measuring gas in the right ventricle have been described by Van Ieperen 167 and reviewed by Bajanowski et a1. 168 Air embolism, venous or arterial, can be difficult or impossible to demonstrate after extensive resuscitative efforts, especially if open chest massage is employed.

An uncomplicated simple pneumothorax is usually accompanied by shortness of breath and pleuritic chest pain (80% to 90%) but may be asymptomatic (10% ). 184 Respiratory distress generally becomes apparent in an otherwise healthy patient when at least 40% of the lung collapses. 18S In some cases, a unidirectional air leak follows pulmonary disruption or chest wall perforation. Air enters the pleural space but cannot exit, resulting in progressively increasing intrathoracic pressure. The increased pressure may compress the lung, heart, great vessels, and trachea, and shift the mediastinum, resulting in impaired ventilation and decreased cardiac output. Chest wall defects leading to the development of a tension pneumothorax are often described as \"sucking\" chest wounds and the resultant pneumothorax as an \"open\" pneumothorax. An exception for the requirement of a one-way leak may arise during scuba diving. An otherwise simple pneumothorax may be converted to a tension pneumothorax as the gas expands during ascent. Clinical signs of a tension pneumothorax include asymmetric chest wall movement, distended neck veins, and tracheal deviation. Clinically, a pneumothorax may be identified on the basis of the 1189 history and physical findings but is most commonly assessed using standard chest radiography.",

Amniotic fluid embolism has also been associated with cesarean section (19% of cases),219 abortion, abdominal trauma, uterine rupture, and intrapartum amnioinfusion. 220 Risk factors for AFE include advanced maternal age, multiparity, and tumultuous labor. 18s The clinical syndrome is typically heralded by the acute onset of shortness of breath and hypotension followed by cardiopulmonary collapse.219-221 Other frequent signs and symptoms include disseminated intravascular coagulation (D I C), pulmonary edema, seizures, and fetal distress. 125 In fatal cases, death usually occurs within hours of collapse and, in many cases, within 1 hour of the onset of symptoms. 125,212, 222 The development of AFE requires ruptured gestational membranes, a pressure gradient favoring movement from the uterus to the maternal circulation, and an entry site for the amniotic fluid to reach the cir-culation. 125 ,22o, 223 The latter is usually through small tears in the lower uterine segment or endocervix. 223 -225 Complex pathophysiologic alterations induced by the constituents of amniotic fluid are responsible for the perturbations of cardiovascular function, oxygenation, and coagulation that characterize AFE. 220 ,226 These pathophysiologic mechanisms have not been fully clarified, but it appears that the primary process is not simply mechanical obstruction of the pulmonary vasculature by the solid material in the amniotic fluid, 125 The amount of particulate matter in the pulmonary vasculature in cases of AFE does not always correlate with the clinical course, a feature of importance to the pathologist, as will be discussed subsequently. It has been postulated that AFE involves a complex immunohumoral reaction resulting from exposure to fetal products that incites an immunologic response in the mother leading to the observed clinical syndrome. 2l9 ,221 A role for anaphylaxis in AFE has been suggested by a number of cases in which elevated blood tryptase concentration has been measured. However, a number of other cases with decreased complement and normal tryptase concentration suggests a role for complement activation rather than mast cell degranulation in the development of the clinical syndrome of AFE. [227] [228] [229] [230] Experimental and human observations support a biphasic hemodynamic phenomenon. 221 ,226, 231 The initial response is suggested to be acute pulmonary vasoconstriction that may lead to right heart failure. This phase is transient and is postulated to be replaced by the effects of the release of inflammatory materials in the lung that induce a capillary leak syndrome and depression of the myocardium. The initial vasoconstrictive phase has not been observed in humans but has been documented in experimental 1191 animals. The lack of documentation of the initial phase in humans may reflect the lack of hemodynamic monitoring during the early phase in human cases. 221 Classically, the definitive diagnosis of AFE has been made at autopsy and requires demonstrating the presence of amniotic fluid in maternal pulmonary blood vessels, 222 The presence of identifiable amniotic fluid within maternal lung tissue sections is almost always, if not always, abnormal. An AFE is not a common physiologic occurrence 220 ; contraction of the uterus appears to be effective in collapsing uterine veins.",

Davies 220 , in a 2001 review, supports the use of the technique developed by Masson for obtaining a PMV sample through the distal lumen of a wedged pediatric anesthesia catheter. 223 Masson 223 has concluded that the observation of large numbers of squamous cells in such a sample strongly supports the diagnosis of AFE, particularly when the squamous cells are coated with neutrophils or if they are accompanied by other fetal debris. It has also been suggested that confirmation of the diagnosis might center on the identification of other amniotic fluid elements rather than the squamous cells. 237 ",

Historically, the method used most often to assess whether breathing has occurred is the hydrostatic test. This test is performed by simply placing the lungs in a container of water and observing whether or not they float. Various modifications of the test specify using one intact lung, both lungs, or both lungs with the adjacent mediastinal structures attached. Flotation implies aeration and thus breathing, whereas lungs that sink are considered not to have been aerated and are thus indicative of stillbirth. Unfortunately, this test is fraught with false-positive and false-negative results and is thus of limited use. 253 Gas generated during decomposition or air forced into the lungs of a stillborn during resuscitation attempts can result in lung flotation and a false-positive flotation test. Infants born alive who carry out feeble breathing efforts may not aerate their lungs to the extent that the lungs float and will provide a false-negative hydrostatic test. A number of attempts have been made to establish histologic criteria for establishing the presence of breathing. 253 Overall, these are not particularly helpful and probably do not add anything to a well-performed gross inspection. Overall, fully expanded lungs that float in water in the absence of putrefaction and resuscitation strongly support live birth. Similarly, unaerated lungs as described above that sink in water strongly support stillbirth. In cases with intermediate findings the determination of livebirth or stillbirth should rest primarily on other factors. As so aptly stated by Adelson 254 more than 25 years ago, unless pathologists have incontrovertible evidence of postnatal survival, they are bound not to diagnose livebirth.",

Protocols for autopsy and investigation of sudden, unexpected infant deaths are available. 255 There is marked variation in the incidence of SIDS among different populations, both around the world and within individual societies. SIDS is the leading \"cause\" of unexpected death of infants between 1 month and 1 year of age. SIDS deaths most commonly occur between 2 and 4 months of age, are rare after 8 months and are characteristically associated with sleep.257,258 Currently, approximately 20% of cases occur while the child is in the custody of a child-care provider,z59 Prior to 1992, the reported incidence of SIDS in the United States was approximately 1.5/1000 live births.",

Over the years, of the dozens of theories that have been proposed to explain SIDS, most have fallen by the wayside. A number of studies have reported changes thought to be related to chronic hypoxia. 261 ,262 Among these proposed hypoxia markers was reported hyperplasia and hypertrophy of the media of pulmonary vessels. Other studies have failed to confirm most of these observations,z63-266 Most recently, normal developmental modifications of arousal and autonomic function and how they may interact with environmental stressors are being carefully explored and appear to offer promise in explaining a part of the mechanism leading to the deaths of many of these infants. 1.267,268 One of the strong risk factors for SIDS that has been extensively studied is prone sleeping (especially when it is not the accustomed position) and, by extension, the overall sleep environment. Cote et al. 269 have reported that 139 of 157 SIDS cases were found prone, although only 93 of the infants usually slept prone. In a series of SIDS deaths in Chicago, the odds ratio (OR) for prone sleeping was 2.4. In addition, the OR was 2.5 for infants sleeping on soft bedding or whose heads/faces were covered by bedding. However, the OR was 21 for those infants dying prone on soft beddingYo A mechanism of death in these infants has been proposed as rebreathing of exhaled air.271 Coupled with being in this potentially compromising position is the possibility of increased vulnerability of the child, notably developmental changes in the brainstem nuclei involved in reflex responses to cardiorespira tory stimuli,incl uding arousal. 267,268,272 Depressed arousal from sleep has been linked to a variety of recognized SIDS risk factors including recent illness, prone sleeping, maternal smoking, and prematurity. Increased arousability has been linked to factors associated with a decreased risk of SIDS such as the use of pacifiers and breast-feeding. 273 ,274 Successful modification of these risk factors, particularly in avoiding prone sleeping and soft bedding, avoiding passive smoking, and promoting breast-feeding (Back to Sleep campaign)275 has been associated with a reported 44% decrease in the incidence of SIDS in the United States,z76 Although a dramatic decrease in SIDS has been reported from multiple populations that have had campaigns to change sleep position and other SIDS risk factors, it is not clear how much of the apparent drop in SIDS is due to diagnostic shift from SIDS to suffocation or \"undetermined,\" and how much is a true decrease in the number of infant deaths. A recent study based on review of death certificate data suggests that up to 90% of the apparent decrease in SIDS may be due to a shift in death certification practices.277 More definitive answers should become available as detailed studies of specific populations are reported.",

The major physiologic consequence in flail chest has been attributed to contusion of the adjacent lung and decreased vital capacity. 290 Lung contusion (bruise) is the most common lung injury caused by blunt force and is also the most common potentially lethal chest injury. Like bruises elsewhere on the body, pulmonary contusion results primarily from the tearing of parenchymal small blood vessels. These tears M.A. Graham are not grossly apparent. The resulting bleeding leads to a discrete area of parenchymal hemorrhage with most of the extravasated blood being found within air spaces (Fig.  31.29 ). In adults, the presence of pulmonary contusion is more likely if ribs are fractured.

Grossly, contusion is visible almost immediately. However, contusion may not be evident on a chest radiograph for several hours. Contusions resolve quickly. Clearing is seen radiographically within 1 to 2 days, with resolution in 3 days. 293, 294 Pulmonary contusion manifests itself by the development of respiratory failure over time. The degree of respiratory impairment caused by pulmonary contusion is proportional to the extent of the contusion. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) develops in 82% of patients having more than 20% of their lung tissue contused, whereas only 22% develop ARDS if less than 20% of the lung is bruised. 283 The extent of preexisting lung disease is also a determinant factor in the clinical signifi- cance of pulmonary contusion.

            "text": "An explosion results in the formation of a high-pressure wave of compressed air (blast wave) that propagates radially from the seat of the explosion. The characteristics of the blast wave are determined by the type of explosive (high explosive-supersonic blast wave; low explosivesubsonic blast wave) and the medium through which the wave passes (air, water, solid structure). Most explosions occur on land, above ground, and thus the blast wave propagates through the air. Environmental structures may also affect the characteristics of the wave by focusing, deflecting, or reflecting it. The incidence of fatal blast injury is variable. While uncommon in some bombing incidents,304 in other scenarios it has been reported to contribute to as high as 86% of explosion fatalities and 47% to 57% of injuries sustained by survivors.30s In general, blast injury is dictated by the size and duration of the blast wave (proportional to the size of the explosion), the proximity of the victim to the blast (wave deteriorates exponentially from the center of the explosion), orientation of the victim to the blast, environmental factors, and features of the tissues/organs. 304 ,306 Blast wave damage is a form of barotrauma. Internal organs/tissues having airlfiuid interfaces and air-filled organs are most susceptible to a blast wave traveling through the air. Damage to the organs/tissues is caused by the effects of high-frequency stress waves and lowfrequency shear waves. 307 Pressure differentials at these interfaces are reinforced by reflection of the stress waves off the mediastinum and thoracic cavity.304, 308 The tissue most sensitive to the effects of an air blast wave is the eardrum.306 Relatively small increases in pressure (as little as 5 psi in excess of atmospheric pressure )309 can damage the tympanic membrane. Larger pressure increases may disrupt middle ear structures. Other organs require higher pressure gradients (56 to 76 psi) to sustain injury. The lack of tympanic membrane rupture makes barotrauma to other organs unlikely but does not preclude it. 306 Injury to the lung, the second most susceptible tissue to an air blast wave, is responsible for most deaths caused by an air blast wave. 306 The extent of blast injury to the lung is a critical factor in determining mortality. The blast wave results in air-space enlargement and disruption of alveolar walls.31O Damage at the alveolar/capillary interface can lead to hemorrhage (Fig. 31.32 ), air embolism, pneumothorax, hemothorax, pneumomediastinum, and subcutaneous emphysema. 311 Air embolism is considered a major factor in immediate deaths due to blast injury. Experimental animals dying within 30 minutes of blast injury commonly succumb as a consequence of air embolism. 304 Histologic evidence of air embolism was reported by Tsokos et al.311 in four of eight blast wave human fatalities. Blast-induced hemorrhage can also play a role in morbidity and mortality. Massive hemorrhage can cause or contribute to rapid death. Delayed lethality is often due to progressive pulmonary insufficiency caused by intraalveolar hemorrhage, edema due to damage of the capillary/alveolar interface, Fat embolism is also common in victims of lethal blast injury, being seen in five of the eight blast fatalities reported by Tsokos et al. and may contribute to delayed pulmonary dysfunction. Depletion of pulmonary antioxidant reserves leading to free radical oxidative stress has been postulated to further contribute to lung injury. Hemoglobin released by ruptured red blood cells has been implicated in amplification of the oxidative stress. 312 -315 Pulmonary death/injury can also result from penetration/perforation by projectiles ( Fig. 31.33 ). In fact, projectiles are responsible for most deaths in bombing incidents except in incidents with massive building collapses. 306 These projectiles may be components of the bomb necessary for its function (e.g., wire, timer, blasting cap), its transport or concealment (e.g., case), enhancement of antipersonnel injuries (shrapnel), or fragmented materials from disrupted articles around the device. Recovery of these materials may help ascertain the design, components, or placement of the device (Fig. 31.34 ) and thus help in the recognition of the sources of materials used to construct the device and the identity of the bomb 1199 FIGURE 31.33.

Obstruction due to airway swelling usually involves the larynx, soft tissues immediately above the larynx, or the parenchymal small airways. Swelling may be induced by infections, anaphylaxis, aspiration of an irritating substance, or direct trauma to the larynx. Airway obstruction due to trauma is often the result of injury to the larynx caused by a direct blow or neck compression. Most commonly, the mucosa immediately proximal to the larynx swells as a reaction to the blow or to a fracture of the superior horns of the thyroid cartilage ( Fig. 31.35 ). In these cases the structural integrity of the airway is maintained, and death results from progressive luminal narrowing due to the swelling. The onset of signs and symptoms of respiratory difficulty, as well as death, may be delayed for hours depending on the rate and extent of the swelling. Uncommonly, trauma may result in extensive airway fractures, typically of the lamina of the thyroid cartilage ( Fig. 31.36) , resulting in instability of the larynx with airflow obstruction due to collapse of the larynx during inhalation. In these cases, respiratory distress is typically evident immediately. Cervical hematomas may expand and compress the airway, usually the trachea. Mediastinal tumors, usually Hodgkin's disease, have been reported to cause sudden airway compression leading to death, often in the setting of anesthesia induction. 316 Choking involves blockage of the internal airway by a foreign material. If the obstructing material is a discrete object in adults, it is generally not inhaled into the deep airway but is usually impacted deep in the posterior pharynx where it straddles the openings to the larynx and esophagus (Fig. 31.37 ). In contrast, choking in children often involves inhalation (aspiration) of a small object deep into the airway.",

Aspiration of black pepper causes mechanical obstruction by its volume and mucosal edema by its irritant effect (Fig. 31.38 ).317-319 Piperine is the primary irritant in black pepper. 317 . 319 The recognition of the correct mechanism or relative combination of mechanisms is important since different amounts of pepper are required for each mechanism and the time course of the fatal incident is also potentially different. It is important to attempt to quantify the amount of pepper (dry weight or volume) within the airways and elsewhere. The presence of preexisting conditions such as reactive airway disease can also influence the outcome of pepper inhalation. In a series of eight lethal pepper aspiration cases reported by Cohie et al.,317 seven were the result of child abuse. The victims are characteristically young children who are administered pepper as punishment by their caregivers.317\u00b732o. 321 The death of the other child in the Cohle et al. series was accidental and occurred in a child with documented pica, as was the child reported by Sheahan et al.318 Gastric Aspiration Aspiration of other nondiscrete materials also occurs. Perhaps the most common of these is aspiration of gastric contents, which, although frequently observed in decedents, is an unusual cause of death. Aspiration of gastric contents most commonly occurs as an agonal or postmortem event in individuals dying of unrelated conditions (Fig. 31.39 ). Agonal gastric aspiration may hinder resuscitation efforts and may lead to severe respiratory problems in surviving patients. When gastric aspiration occurs as an antemortem clinically significant event, it is usually in the setting of impaired consciousness with inadequate airway protection or an ineffective swallowing mechanism. The administration of anesthesia is a major risk for developing aspiration, especially in emergency situations where anesthesia is being administered to a patient with a full stomach.",

It is has been estimated that at least OAmLlkg must be aspirated to cause significant lung injury. 323 The effects of aspirating gastric material having a pH in excess of 2.5 will depend on the volume, tonicity, and the presence and characteristics of particulate material. 322 Aspiration of clear non-acidic liquid such as water results in hemorrhage, pulmonary edema, separation of endothelial cells from basement membranes, and peribronchial acute inflammation. 32 4-326 Little necrosis of alveolar cells takes place. 326 If the aspirated material contains large particles, obstruction of large airways occurs and death may rapidly ensue from asphyxia. 322 Aspiration of material containing small particles results in extensive, prolonged pneumonia. Early in its course the inflammatory infiltrate contains neutrophils (Fig. 31.40) and has a foreign body or granulomatous component (see Fig. 5 .7 in Chapter 5). Later, the infiltrate is mononuclear. Foreign body granulomas persist. 322 Infection accompanying aspiration falls into two general scenarios. Aspiration of a small heavily contaminated inoculum results in necrotizing bronchopneumonia, often with abscess formation (Fig. 31.41 ). Empyema may also develop. These infections are usually caused by oropharyngeal bacterial flora, typically anaerobic organisms. 322 The development of these infections is affected by the person's dental hygiene, overall health status, and Not all aspirated material is foreign to the body, although it may be foreign to the airway. Aspiration of blood from injuries or diseases stemming from the head or neck may block the airway. Similarly, hemorrhage from pulmonary lesions such as tumors, cavitary tuberculosis, and other necrotizing inflammatory processes may erode vessels of substantial size and result in either airway obstruction or, in some cases, exsanguination.",

Breathholding may be attempted and is usually followed by a period of involuntary laryngospasm due to the presence of liquid in the oropharynx or larynx. 335 The victim develops hypoxia, hypercarbia, and acidosis 336 and, at some point, laryngospasm abates. 337 Uncontrollable hyperventilation may lead to aspiration of variable, sometimes large, amounts of water that may increase the risk of vomiting and aspiration of gastric contents.

However, Modell et a1. 334 have reported that this sequence of events is rarely observed by witnesses to a drowning. In some cases, such as in shallow water blackout due to presubmersion hyperventilation, unconsciousness precedes the onset of the drowning process and breathing underwater occurs without evidence of panic or struggle. In most cases of human drowning the body of the drowning victim is found either underwater or floating on the surface without an eyewitness to the immediately preceding events. 334 The major pathophysiologic consequence of drowning is prolonged hypoxia with resultant metabolic acidosis. 339 , 340 The hypoxia is due predominately to the aspiration of water. However, the amount of liquid inhaled varies considerably from individual to individual. 337 In humans, aspiration of 1 to 3 mLlkg has been associated with profound alterations in pulmonary gas exchange and decreased pulmonary compliance.341-344 In most cases of drowning it is possible to demonstrate the presence of the characteristic foamy/frothy fluid seen after water aspiration,334 a condition often referred to as \"wet\" drowning.",

            "text": "It has often been written that no significant water aspiration occurs in 10% to 15% of cases,334,335 so-called \"dry\" drowning. This estimate is primarily based on animal studies reported in the 1930s and 1940s.345-347 Theories advanced to explain these cases include laryngospasm, vagus-mediated cardiac rhythm disturbances, pulmonary reflex, and absorption of fresh water into the systemic circula tion. 345, [348] [349] [350] However, establishing the presence of dry drowning is problematic. 334 ,351 No specific diagnostic criteria are available, different studies are based on ill-defined or unstated criteria, and, in some cases, the diagnosis appears based on the weight of the lungs. Reviews of the experimental data and human case reviews have led to either questioning or discounting the concept of dry drowning. Review of the original animal experiments of Cot 346 indicates that all animals subjected to the complete drowning process demonstrated the foamy/frothy fluid characteristic of water aspiration. 334 In some cases Cot could not retrieve water from the lungs, a situation that suggested the lack of aspiration. However, in other studies using water with some visible marker as the drowning medium, all animals demonstrated diffuse distribution of the water throughout the lungs. Other authors have observed that in cases of fresh water drowning in dogs in which no water could be drained from the lungs, there was evidence of strong hemodilution attributed to rapid admittance of water from the lungs into the blood with resultant ventricular fibrillation. 334 Some authors consider dry drowning as either cases of natural death occurring in the water or disposal of dead bodies in water. 334 , 352 The author agrees with the conclusions reached at the 2002 World Congress on Drowning that \"all drownings are wet\" and that the terms wet drowning and dry drowning should be abandoned. 327 Drowning can occur in all types of water-fresh, salt, or brackish. When fresh water is aspirated, the water rapidly moves from the air spaces into the blood vessels, removes surfactant, and damages the pneumocytes. 335 In contrast, when salt water is inhaled, fluid moves from the blood vessels into the lung tissue and air spaces, leading to the rapid onset of protein-rich pulmonary edema. Salt water also leads to the destruction of surfactant and capillary damage. 353 The loss of surfactant leads to decreased compliance and atelectasis and marked ventilation-perfusion mismatch. 335 Although movement of water into or out of the circulation (fresh versus salt water) conceivably could alter the blood's electrolyte concentrations, in most cases this does M.A. Graham not seem to be a major issue from a clinical standpoint except in water having a high electrolyte content, such as the Dead Sea. 335 ,354 However, the role, if any, of electrolyte changes in persons dead in the water is not known. It is generally agreed that the amount of water aspirated is more significant than the type of water. 337 ,355, 356 The temperature of the water can also have an effect on the drowning process, especially when the water is cold. Cold water, especially lOoC or colder, has significant cardiovascular effects and may also trigger a gasp reflex with subsequent hyperventilation. 357 Aspiration of particulate, chemical, or biologic contaminants in the water may further compromise the lungs, as may the aspiration of gastric contents. Some individuals who survive the initial submersion incident develop pneumonia or diffuse alveolar damage hours to days later.",

            "text": "Dysbarism encompasses a variety of pathologic changes caused by the effects of altered environmental pressure on closed air spaces (barotrauma) or problems caused by breathing gases at elevated partial pressures (decompression illness). Most changes are acute but occasionally may be delayed for months or years (e.g., dysbaric osteonecrosis 363 ,364 and dysbaric retinopathy365,366). Most commonly seen in scuba divers (\"scuba\" is an acronym for self-contained underwater breathing apparatus) and compressed-air workers (e.g., tunnel workers laboring under increased atmospheric pressure), dysbarism is occasionally seen in situations where there is a sudden reduction in pressure at conditions of high altitude. 367 In 2001, there were 9 million certified scuba divers in the United States. 368 During 1980 to 1996, 1290 deaths were associated with scuba activities. Drowning is the most common cause of death during diving and reflects a number of factors including inexperience, entrapment, entanglement, injury, inadequate air supply, and natural disease. Among divers over the age of 35 years, cardiovascular disease is the second most common cause of death during diving. 369 In a series of 60 diving fatalities during 1996 in which autopsy reports were available for review, decompression illness caused or contributed to 11 of the deaths-lO due to arterial gas embolism (AGE) and one to decompression sickness. 369 Although decompression sickness is an uncommon cause of scuba-related death, it is an important contributor to morbidity. 369 During descent while diving, the volume of gas decreases as it is compressed by the pressure of the water. Normally, gas pressure in the various air-filled spaces of the body and equipment is in equilibrium with the environment. 367 If the passages for gas exchange are blocked and a change in ambient pressure occurs, pressure disequilibria occur. Discomfort due to pressure disequilibria during descent mainly affect the ears, face (a face mask's entrapped air), sinuses, and lungs.367. 368 The latter, known as lung squeeze, is often manifest by pulmonary edema and frothy hemoptysis. 367 Serious pulmonary dysbarism is most often related to ascent 359 and reflects the expansion of gas volume as the ambient pressure decreases toward the surface of the water. 367 Decompression illness encompasses two entities-pulmonary barotrauma of ascent (pulmonary overpressurization syndrome [POPS]) and the decompression syndrome. 367.369 Overdistention and resultant tearing of alveolar septa by entrapped expanding gas allow the gas to reach extraalveolar sites (Fig. 31.44 ). Pulmonary overpressurization syndrome most commonly is associated with rapid uncon- trolled ascent and may occur during ascent from as shallow as 6 feet, especially if the diver is breath holding. Other factors favoring air entrapment include bronchospasm/reactive airway disease, structural lesions impeding egress of air (bullae, endobronchial mass lesions), and too-rapid ascent. 367 The most serious and feared manifestation of POPS is AGE. Other manifestations include pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, subcutaneous emphysema, alveolar hemorrhage, and venous gas embolism. Signs and symptoms of POPS occur almost immediately upon surfacing, an important point to remember when evaluating scuba deaths.367.37o",

The heat carrying capacity of steam is 4000 times greater than that of hot air. 374 Steam is capable of maintaining its heat as it passes down the airway and is capable of causing bronchial damage. Signs of potential inhalation injury include singed facial or nasal hair, carbonaceous sputum, facial burns, and extensive burns, in general. The manifestations of inhalation injury may be delayed for up to 24 hours.",

            "text": "The appearance of particulate material and other pulmonary findings associated with substance abuse may be influenced by the drug (pharmacologic effects), adulterants (pharmacologically active or inactive), filler materials (pharmacologically inactive), host factors, techniques of preparation and administration (e.g., filtering, burning), and length of survival. Adulterants (e.g., strychnine) are usually present in small amounts and, except for their pharmacologic effects and sequelae, do not produce significant pulmonary findings. Filler materials or cutting agents may be present in large amounts and have considerable effects on the lungs depending on their solubility, amount, thrombogenicity, and the reaction (such as fibrogenic) they elicit in the tissues (Fig. 31.52 ). Some illicit substances intended for intravenous injection may also be nearly or completely free of insoluble substances. Soluble substances such as lactose or procaine are commonly used as cutting agents. Pharmaceuticals intended for oral ingestion typically contain a significant amount of insoluble filler material. These fillers include talc, microcrystalline cellulose, magnesium stearate, siliciumoxid, cornstarch,438 and crospovidone. 439 The presence of a large amount of these substances in the lungs of an intravenous substance abuser strongly suggests that the injection of compounds intended for oral administration has occurred. In some cases the nature of the filler material can offer critical insight into the nature of the abused substance(s). Material introduced by the techniques of preparation (carbonaceous particles from heating, fibers from filtering) of an illicit preparation is generally present in small quantities and does not cause extensive pulmonary lesions. Rarely, attempts at central vein injection may result in needle fragments embolizing to the lung (Fig. 31.53 ).395 Mercury emboli due to intravenous injection with the intent of enhancing athletic or sexual performance have been reported. 44o , 441 The route of administration of a particular substance may be a critical issue in a particular case. Usually, the M.A. Graham cular and perivascular deposition of birefringent oral pharmaceutical filler material (polarized light). route of administration is known either by information from the history or through other findings (e.g., injection sites). Occasionally, the presence of substance abuse or the route of exposure is unsuspected, concealed, or in dispute. Once the presence of material that may be medication filler is established, a major issue that needs resolution is whether the material was inhaled or injected (usually intravenously). A number of factors generally allow this distinction to me made. These factors include the location of the material and any reaction to it, the state of ferrugination among certain types of particles, and the size distribution of the particles. The presence of a foreign-body reaction within the blood vessel wall or FIGURE 31.53 . Lung with migratory needle that broke off during central venous injection. lumen is indicative of injection. In the case of talc, inhaled particles often show some evidence of ferrugination, whereas injected particles do not tend to ferruginate. Uncoated talc particles are generally absent from air spaces in cases of intravenous injection. I Inhaled particles are generally no more than 51lm in diameter, whereas injected substances have a substantial population of larger particles. 442 Further discussion of the effects of insoluble particulate emboli is presented in Chapter 26.",
