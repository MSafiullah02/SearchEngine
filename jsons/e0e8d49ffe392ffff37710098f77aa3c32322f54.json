Moreover, a debate has arisen regarding the ethical basis of the clinical and public health research being conducted during these emergencies. Research opportunities in bioemergencies are ample, and a number of considerations must be taken into account to ensure patient, public, and care worker safety. Conducting effective research in these environments requires making the distinction between it and public health practice or operational response [1] .",

Despite the broadly recognized importance of this research, international and domestic ethics guiding principles, as well as basic human rights, must be upheld and protected. Critical to these efforts is distinguishing the difference between data collection and analysis for effective response and clinical practice in an operational response and human subjects research for generalizable knowledge. To make this distinction, one must address the intent of the activity, which easily becomes blurred during emergencies [1] . For example, in a recent outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS Co-V), epidemiologic and clinical data were collected and analyzed to determine the most effective infection control measures. The goal of this investigation was to effectively reduce transmission of MERS Co-V; however, the data will ultimately inform broader research questions outside of the context of the outbreak.",

Finally, diagnostic and screening research seeks to detect specific diseases or individuals afflicted by them. These studies offer new information Other research is necessary for an effective clinical and public health response beyond clinical research. Operational or implementation research in bioemergencies often focuses on real-time improvements to the clinical or health system response.

FDA regulations allow for use of an investigational drug or biological product in a life-threatening situation in which no standard acceptable treatment is available and in which there is not sufficient time to obtain IRB approval [8] . The regulation allows for one emergency use of a test article without prospective IRB review; subsequent use of the investigational product at the institution has prospective IRB review and approval. FDA acknowledges, however, that it would be inappropriate to deny emergency treatment to a ond individual if the only obstacle is that the IRB has not had sufficient time to convene a meeting to review the issue. Even for an emergency use, the investigator is required to obtain informed consent of the subject or the subject's legally authorized representative (except as has been described above).",

The IRB reviews this information (along with the full sponsor protocol, the informed consent documents, the investigator's brochure, and any additional materials) at a full convened meeting. After due deliberation, the board may approve the research conditional upon minor modifications or return the application to the investigator for clarification or modifications needed to satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. In addition, review and approval by other committees (scientific review, Pharmacy and Therapeutics, Sponsored Programs and Contracts, Institutional Biosafety) may be needed.

Affected populations are inherently vulnerable, and all aspects of conducting research in this emergency environment are challenging. Careful adherence to the high standards set for human subjects research helps to ensure that the rights and welfare of individuals are protected in bioemergencies and that all persons maintain trust in the research relationship and process.",
