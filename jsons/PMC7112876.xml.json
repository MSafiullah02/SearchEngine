They are distinguished from other RNA viruses by their large genome size of 25\u201333 kb (Lai et al., 2007, Brian and Baric, 2005, Gorbalenya et al., 2006, Masters, 2006). The few known toroviruses are very closely related and form 3 species in a single genus. In contrast, the subfamily Coronavirinae includes dozens of species that are grouped into three genera: alpha-, beta- and gammacoronaviruses (formerly known as groups 1, 2 and 3) which are recognized as monophyletic genetic clusters (Gonzalez et al., 2003, Gorbalenya et al., 2004) (Fig. 1\n).",

CoVs can infect a wide range of hosts, including humans. ToVs are involved mainly in enteric pathologies whereas CoVs are associated with a broader spectrum of clinical manifestations including also respiratory, hepatic, renal, reproductive and neurological diseases (Cavanagh, 2005). The first identified human coronaviruses (HCoV), HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, are generally linked to mild respiratory symptoms, responsible for about 10\u201315% of common colds (Heikkinen and Jarvinen, 2003) and up to 5% of severe respiratory tract illness (Buecher et al., 2010, Gaunt et al., 2010, Do et al., 2011, Dominguez et al., 2009, Vijgen et al., 2005). Therefore, until the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak caused by a new CoV in 2003 (Donnelly et al., 2003), the impact of CoV infections was somewhat neglected since they were considered of minor clinical importance to humans. The identification of the HCoV\u2013SARS in 2003 (Drosten et al., 2003, Ksiazek et al., 2003, Peiris et al., 2003) prompted an increased interest in the natural CoV biodiversity. As a result, a number of CoVs have been identified in a large variety of animal species (Guan et al., 2003, Tong et al., 2009, Shi and Hu, 2008, Mihindukulasuriya et al., 2008, Pfefferle et al., 2009, Woo et al., 2007, Woo et al., 2009b, Chu et al., 2006, Dong et al., 2007, Poon et al., 2005, Vijaykrishna et al., 2007). Among the coronaviruses discovered recently are also two novel human viruses, HCoV-NL63 (van der Hoek et al., 2004, Fouchier et al., 2004, Esper et al., 2005) and HCoV-HKU1 (Woo et al., 2005, Lau et al., 2006) both associated with upper and lower respiratory tract infections. The extensive genetic diversity, observed among CoVs and suspected for ToVs, suggests that the family Coronaviridae might harbor many more as yet unrecognized members, also outside the established taxons.",

The CODEHOP combines elements of consensus and degenerate design in a hybrid approach that complements weaknesses of each design (Rose et al., 1998). Primers are split in two adjacent parts, 3\u2032 degenerate (core) and the 5\u2032 consensus (clamp) that, respectively, facilitate the initial selective target recognition and stabilization of the primer-target annealing that follows. Subsequent rounds of the target amplification are driven by an increased temperature of annealing between the 5\u2032 consensus clamp and its complement sequence that was already incorporated into the amplified product on a prior round. The CODEHOP approach allows the design of primers for datasets that are prohibitory divergent for either consensus or degenerate primers. It has been used successfully to identify unknown retrovirus, herpesvirus, lentivirus and papillomavirus in specimens containing a vast background of genomic DNA (Baines et al., 2005, Rose, 2005, Staheli et al., 2009).",

The Viralis software platform, in which ClustalW was integrated, assisted with the alignment manipulation and evaluation, including underlying nucleotide alignments. The RdRp amino acid alignment was processed by the Blocks Maker program (Henikoff et al., 1998). Using the default settings of the CODEHOP software (no restrictions on codon boundary, most common codons in the clamp, annealing temperature \u226560 \u00b0C) and the codon table of Homo sapiens, two blocks corresponding to, respectively, motifs A and B of the RdRp active site (Gorbalenya et al., 1989, Poch et al., 1989), were identified as best candidates for a pair of primers (CT12-oCODEHOP primers) separated by <500 nt (Fig. 2\n). The forward primer directed to motif A has a 16-fold degeneracy, predicted annealing temperature 63.2 \u00b0C, and consists of an 11 nt degenerate core and 16 nt consensus clamp. The reverse primer targeting motif B has a 32-fold degeneracy, annealing temperature 62.4 \u00b0C, and includes an 11 nt degenerate core and 13 nt consensus clamp. The target region for amplification, including the primer templates, was 205 nt and 193 nt for established CoVs and a ToV, respectively.

For the degenerate part of the primer, degeneracy was set to encompass the entire codon diversity that is compatible with the observed amino acid diversity. As a result, the degenerate core was allowed to include codons not observed in the input alignment. For the consensus clamp region, the algorithm seeks to limit both the average number of mismatches and its variability range between viruses. Technically, it minimizes the sum of the mean and maximum distances between the generated consensus and the actual sequences while observing the sequence codon structure:(1)H=M+\u03c1maxwhere H, equivalence function; M, mean; and \u03c1\nmax, a maximum distance between a consensus and sequences. The algorithm was written in C and incorporated in the Viralis package to facilitate analysis. Using it, in silico primers were predicted (designated CT12-sCODEHOP) that, on average, had fewer mismatches than the CT12-oCODEHOP primers, without increasing the primers degeneracy (Fig. 2).",

This strategy was adjusted to improve the match between primers and templates in the dataset that included 11 coronaviruses and one torovirus. The modifications were guided by a set of rules that were partially implemented in a script. Among the novelties tested was the use of target nucleotide (rather than amino acid) sequences as input and incorporating degeneracy into the consensus part of primers. The recently improved version of CODEHOP (iCODEHOP) does also offer an option to use target nucleotide sequences as input (Boyce et al., 2009).",

Because of its highly conserved structure and function, the pp1ab nsp12 gene (known also as pol gene) encoding an RdRp domain has been frequently targeted for the design of pancoronavirus primers (Stephensen et al., 1999, Moes et al., 2005, Vijgen et al., 2008). More sensitive SYBR and Taqman probe-based real-time RT-PCR methods targeting this gene have also been reported (Escutenaire et al., 2007, Muradrasoli et al., 2009). All these assays have been developed exclusively for coronavirus detection, thus limiting the potential recognition of more distantly related viruses. The CoV/ToV primer set, which is described in this study, is also targeted to the RdRp locus whose two regions, known as the RdRp motifs A and B (Gorbalenya et al., 1989, Poch et al., 1989), were selected by the CODEHOP server as the most suitable for primer design. Further phylogenic analysis of the target fragment sequences has demonstrated that its diversity in coronaviruses is large enough to permit unambiguous species identification by sequencing of the amplified product (Fig. 1, inset).",

            "text": "The designed primers were tested initially in a conventional two-step RT-PCR assay. After obtaining positive results, the assay was modified to a single-tube procedure with an improved processing time of the samples. The detection limits of the one-step CT12-mCODEHOP assay, estimated on individual CoV/ToV cRNA, ranged from 102 to 106 and 105 to 109 RNA copies when tested respectively without and with an excess of human background RNA. Furthermore the assay demonstrated to be sufficiently sensitive to identify all four known circulating human CoV as well as ToV isolates directly from clinical and field specimens, respectively. The detection of CoVs in positive samples with an average Ct value of 29.4 reveals an amplification efficacy, which is somewhat lower than that observed for routine diagnostic assays. That is not surprising given the primers used in the CT12-mCODEHOP assay, unlike those used in a diagnostic real-time RT-PCR, are highly degenerate and do not fully match the target sequences. A good agreement was observed between the results obtained with purified cRNA copies and RNA from specimens (compare Fig. 4, Fig. 5 and Table 2). With the both sources of RNA, the CT12-mCODEHOP primer sensitivity toward HCoV-229E was relatively low; the cause of this deficiency remains to be identified although it is not likely due to a large lineage primer bias since its closest relative HCoV-N63 (Fig. 1) was detected readily (Fig. 5). This type of sensitivity variation in respect to detection of some viruses was also reported by others using CODEHOP primers (Staheli et al., 2009).",

A large-scale screening of human respiratory samples in search for novel viruses will be performed with this assay.
