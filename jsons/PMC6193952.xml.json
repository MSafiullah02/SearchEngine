SP-D knockout (KO) mice have shown increased susceptibility to lung infection induced by gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, virus and fungi14\u201316. SP-D KO mice also showed increased inflammation and lung injury caused by endotoxemia17. By binding to pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), SP-D facilitate the uptake and clearance of pathogens by phagocytes and epithelial cells18, the clearance of apoptotic cells19 and modulating inflammatory processes via NF-\u03baB pathway20,21.

The PTECs from WT and KO mice were identified by double immunofluorescence staining with megalin, a proximal tubular specific biomarker33 and SP-D expression. The results indicates that more than 95% of the isolated cells showed positive megalin staining (PTEC biomarker), suggesting that these isolated cells contain more than 95% of PTECs and are appropriate for following study. The double immunofluorescence staining with SP-D and megalin antibodies showed co-expressions of both proteins in PTECs from WT mice. As expected, PTECs from KO mice showed negative staining for SP-D antibody (Fig. 8A). After cells were exposed to 10 \u00b5g of LPS per ml medium in serum free medium for 24 hours, we subsequently examined the cell viability by MTT assay and apoptosis using TUNEL analysis. LPS treatment caused decreased cell viability in the PTECs from both WT and KO mice; and treated KO PTECs exhibited lower viability compared to treated WT PTECs (Fig. 8B). Consistent with the in vivo data, WT PTECs exhibited lower level of apoptosis compared with KO PTECs after LPS treatment (Fig. 8C,D). Furthermore, the level of cleaved caspase-3 expression was higher in treated-KO PTECs compared to treated-WT PTECs (Fig. 8E,F). These in vitro data support the in vivo findings that renal SP-D protects from tubular epithelial cells against apoptosis upon LPS treatment. In addition, we examined the effect of exogenous SP-D protein to SP-D KO PTECs after LPS treatment. The results showed that the levels of IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 in the conditioned media of LPS-treated KO PTECs in the presence of exogenous SP-D were significantly decreased compared to that in the absence of exogenous SP-D (i.e. IL-6: 335 \u00b1 36 pg/ml vs 421 \u00b1 45 pg/ml; TNF-\u03b1: 189 \u00b1 25 pg/ml vs 278 + 32 pg/ml, p < 0.05, respectively), suggesting that endogenous SP-D in PTECs may interact with LPS through extracellular molecular form.",

Little is known about the mechanistic roles of innate immune molecule SP-D, which is expressed in both lung and kidney, in the pathogenesis of ALI-induced AKI. In the present study, we have generated and utilized hTG SP-D mice with lung-specific SP-D expression. With WT and SP-D KO and hTG SP-D mice we have explored the mechanisms underlying the role of pulmonary and renal SP-D in pneumonia-induced AKI. These findings from in vivo study demonstrated that lack of SP-D in lung and/or kidney promotes severe renal injury, tubular cell apoptosis, NF-\u03baB activation and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, which consequently results in aggravated lung-kidney crosstalk during pneumonia-induced AKI. Furthermore, in vitro study with isolated primary PTECs demonstrated that SP-D deficient PTECs increases cell sensitivity for apoptosis after treatment with LPS. To our knowledge, this study is the first report to demonstrate that both pulmonary and renal SP-D protects from pneumonia-induced AKI through modulating lung-kidney crosstalk and attenuating renal tubular apoptosis, NF-\u03baB activation and pro-inflammatory cytokine production.",

Histological and cellular analyses further indicate that pneumonia-induced AKI manifested remarkable acute tubular necrosis, which was characterized by bush border loss, tubular epithelial cell sloughing with focal denudation and cast formation. Singbartl et al.7 recently reported that the inhalation of P. aeruginosa only causes mild histological changes in the kidneys at 24 h, characterized by hyperemia and tubular edema.

Survival rate in KO mice after infection was accordingly significantly decreased compared to WT mice. However, endotoxemia-induced indirect lung injury showed increased pulmonary inflammation but with a paradoxical decrease in mortality in SP-D KO mice when compared with WT mice17. Distinct phenotypes in direct v.s. indirect ALI models may partly explain these different observations. Direct lung injury is characterized by more severe lung epithelial injury and less severe endothelial injury, while the opposite pattern was identified in indirect lung injury40. Interestingly, hTG mice had more deteriorated renal function and renal histopathological changes compared with infected WT mice even though they presented similar levels of lung injury, implying the role of renal SP-D itself in attenuating lung-kidney interaction. However, in contrast to the observation in the clinical patients that a modest rise in Scr was associated with a 6.5-fold increase in the odds of death41, the attenuated AKI was not accompanied by significantly improved rate of mortality in infected WT mice than hTG mice, suggesting that other factors may also be involved in the morbidity and mortality of septic animals. In this work we tried to investigate the crosstalk between lung and kidney and the effect of organ-specific expressing SP-D using WT, SP-D KO and hTG SP-D mice in the pneumonia-induced sepsis. Primary injurious organ in this model is the lung due to intratracheal delivery of pathogenic bacteria. The secondary injurious organs, i.e. kidney injury, could be caused by the lack of SP-D expression but it may be influenced by the differential systemic inflammation because of differential lung injury.",

However, in a two-hit model of AKI and ALI to study kidney-lung cross-talk, only very few and weak apoptotic changes in the kidney were detected after bacterial pneumonia7.

Previous studies have shown that SP-D enhanced the uptake of apoptotic cells by mouse and human alveolar macrophages in vitro and in vivo19. SP-D KO mice have five- to tenfold higher level of apoptotic cells in their alveolar spaces and the treatment of these SP-D KO mice with an intratracheally administered human recombinant SP-D resulted in reduced levels of apoptotic cells. The pulmonary inflammation found in SP-D deficient mice might be owing to the fact that apoptotic cells cannot be cleared and they act as pro-inflammatory factors in the alveolar space45. In agreement with these reports in the lung, we observed that the frequency of apoptosis and expression of cleaved caspase-3 in the tubules of infected KO mice were significantly higher than those in hTG and WT mice. These findings are also consistent with our previous studies that SP-D played a protective role in sepsis-induced AKI27 and acute pancreatic injury46 by modulating renal and pancreatic apoptosis in CLP model. Therefore, these observations support the notion that SP-D deficiency in lung and/or kidney contributes to the aggravated renal tubular apoptosis, and thus causing more severe kidney injury after pulmonary infection. Recently, SP-D is found to suppress extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways of injurious T cells via reduction of caspase-8 activation47,48. In line with this opinion, PTECs lacking SP-D exhibited increased apoptosis, caspase-3 activation and decreased cell viability following LPS treatment.",

Inhibiting NF-\u03baB signaling in renal tubular epithelial lead to reduce tubular injury, apoptosis, necrosis, and accumulation of interstitial inflammatory cells, which consequently results in ameliorated kidney damage after ischemic AKI51. Lung-kidney crosstalk is related to NF-\u03baB dependent proinflammatory cytokines in the study of rats treated with intratracheal lipopolysaccharide instillation32. In this study, the significantly increased renal NF-\u03baB p65 and p-I-\u03baB \u03b1 expression together with elevated renal TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 levels in infected mice have been observed compared to sham mice, which implicated the NF-\u03baB-dependent proinflammatory response indeed involved in the lung-kidney interaction. In contrast, infected KO and hTG mice exhibited aggravated renal NF-\u03baB activation and higher levels of proinflammatory cytokines release owing to the lack of lung and/or kidney SP-D expression. It seems to be explained by the \u2018head or tail hypothesis\u2019 presented by Gardai et al.52. In normal conditions when sufficient SP-D is available, SP-D binds to the signal inhibitory regulatory protein (SIRP\u03b1) of inflammatory cells via its CRD head to activate anti-inflammatory pathways. When infection occurs, the exposed collagenous tail of SP-D adheres to the calreticulin/CD91 receptor complex and initiates a pro-inflammatory response by stimulating p38 MAPK phyosphorylation and NF-\u03baB activation. A similar dual effect was observed in the promotion or inhibition of apoptosis53. Therefore, the lung and kidney SP-D still plays the role of inhibiting inflammation by blocking Toll-like receptor 4 through the CRD54 to some extent even though they were dramatically reduced in infected WT mice, which resulted in the attenuated lung-kidney crosstalk than in KO or hTG mice.",

We found that renal tubular necrosis/apoptosis and inflammatory responses are important mechanisms involving in bacterial pneumonia-induced AKI, in which both pulmonary and renal SP-D participates in the lung-kidney crosstalk and directly or indirectly modulate renal tubular apoptosis and its inflammatory responses. These findings indicated that both pulmonary and renal SP-D proteins are important for modulating bacterial pneumonia-induced AKI. Therefore, based on previous and present findings, SP-D may be an interesting candidate in the exogenous surfactant replacement therapy in clinical pneumonia-induced sepsis and AKI.",

We observed differential degree of lung and kidney injury between infected WT and KO mice with same dose of bacterial infection. When infected KO and WT mice had similar severity of lung injury infected KO mice had more severe kidney injury, suggesting renal SP-D effect in the model. We found that a dose of 1 \u00d7 106 CFU/mouse in 50 \u00b5l of bioluminescent P. aeruginosa Xen5 (a higher toxic strain) bacterial solution is appropriate in order to generate optimal bioluminescent signal in the lung detected by the in vivo imaging system, and to establish ALI-induced AKI with a reasonable survival rate (about 50%) at 48 h after infection. Therefore, all experiments in this study were performed through intratracheal instillation of bioluminescent P. aeruginosa Xen5 at a dose of 1 \u00d7 106 CFU/50 \u03bcl/mouse to induce bacterial pneumonia59,60. Briefly, mice were anesthetized using intraperitoneal ketamine/xylazine (90 mg/kg ketamine, 10 mg/kg xylazine) injection. A 0.5-cm mid-line neck incision was made to expose the trachea. Bacterial solution was intratracheally inoculated into the lung of mice in pneumonia groups and 50 \u03bcl of sterile saline in sham group. At 48 h post infection, mice were anesthetized to obtain blood samples, and then sacrificed to harvest BALF, lungs and kidneys for further analyses59.",
