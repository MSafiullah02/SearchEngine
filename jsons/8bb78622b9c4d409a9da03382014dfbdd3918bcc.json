This review focuses on prokaryotic ISs. We discuss IS distribution and impact on genome evolution. We also examine their effects on gene expression, especially their role in activating neighbouring genes, a phenomenon of particular importance in the recent upsurge of bacterial antibiotic resistance. We explain how ISs are identified and classified into families by a combination of characteristics including their transposases (Tpases), their overall genetic organisation and the accessory genes which some ISs carry. We then describe the organisation of autonomous and nonautonomous IS-related elements. This is used to illustrate the growing recognition that the boundaries between different types of mobile element are becoming increasingly difficult to define as more are being identified. We review the known Tpase types, their different catalytic activities used in cleaving and rejoining DNA strands during transposition, their organisation into functional domains and the role of this in regulation. Finally, we consider examples of prokaryotic IS domestication. In a more speculative section, we discuss the necessity of constructing more quantitative dynamic models to fully appreciate the continuing impact of TEs on prokaryotic populations.",

            "text": "The idea that many prokaryotic genomes are mosaic, composed of a 'central genome backbone' of essential and house-keeping genes (the core genome) interspersed with DNA segments constituting the 'mobilome' (a variety of accessory genes that form part of the pan genome), is now common currency (Medini et al., 2005; Tettelin et al., 2008) . The mobilome embraces several types of genetic unit which, as their collective name indicates, can move from place to place in a particular genome or from cell to cell. These mobile genetic elements (MGEs) can be divided into two major groups: those, such as plasmids and bacteriophages, that are transmissible from cell to cell (the intercellular MGEs), and those that cannot themselves undergo transfer but which are transferred following integration into members of the first group (the intracellular MGEs). Intracellular MGE or transposable elements (TEs) include transposons (Tn) and insertion sequences (ISs) but can embrace integrons (In) and introns . Originally, Tn were distinguished from ISs because they carry passenger (also called cargo) genes not involved in catalysing or regulating TE movement. Most eukaryotic DNA transposons have relatives among the prokaryotic ISs (see (Hickman et al., 2010a, b) ) and it is not surprising that a variety of these elements carrying passenger genes are now also being identified (Bao et al., 2009; Bao & Jurka, 2013) . Prokaryotes harbour a host of such elements as well as several types of structure possessing characteristics of both groups (e.g. integrative conjugative elements, ICEs, originally called conjugative transposons, and other types of genomic island) (Burrus & Waldor, 2004) (Dobrindt et al., 2004; Guerillot et al., 2013) .",

This includes (1) the length and sequence of the short imperfect terminal inverted repeat sequences (IRs) carried by many ISs at their ends (TIRs or ITRs in eukaryotes); (2) the length and sequence of the short flanking direct target DNA repeats (DRs) (TSD, target site duplication, in eukaryotes) often generated on insertion; (3) the organisation of their open reading frames; or (4) the target sequences into which they insert.

            "text": "Since the last surveys [e.g. (Mahillon & Chandler, 1998; Chandler & Mahillon, 2002) ], many new ISs have been identified largely as a result of the massive increase in available sequenced prokaryotic genomes. Careful analysis of a number of these has also revealed that some genomes contain significant levels of truncated and partial ISs devoid of Tpase genes. These genomic 'scars' represent traces of numerous ancestral transposition events. However, genome annotations are often based simply on the presence of Tpase genes and do not include the entire DNA sequence with the IS ends. Indeed, a significant number of solo IS-related IRs have been identified in various genomes (www-is.biotoul.fr; genome section). Small IS fragments are rarely taken into account even though they can provide important insights into the evolutionary history of the host genome. Not only can this seriously impair studies attempting to provide an overview of the evolutionary influence of TEs on bacterial and archeal genomes, but such fragments may encode truncated proteins and these could influence gene regulation [e.g. (Cordaux et al., 2006; Liu et al., 2007; Shaheen et al., 2010) ]. In bacteria (Gueguen et al., 2006) (Stalder et al., 1990) (Salvatore et al., 2001) and eukaryotes (Vos IS1  IS1595  IS3  IS481  IS4  IS701  IS1634  ISH3  IS5  IS1182  IS6  IS21  IS30  IS66  IS256  ISH6  ISLre2  IS630  IS982  IS1380  Tn3  ISAs1  ISAzo13  ISL3  ISNCY  IS110  IS200/IS605  IS91  IS607 DDE Not determined DEDD HuH Serine The horizontal boxes indicate the number and relative size of different subgroups (see Table  1 for the subgroups names) within the family. They are grouped by colour to indicate the type of Tpase used: DDE, blue; undetermined, purple; DEDD, green; HUH, red; Serine, orange. (Rio, 1991) , truncated transposases have been shown to inhibit transposition. One example where annotation of IS fragments has provided important information is in the obligatory intracellular insect endosymbiont, Wolbachia, which also carries high numbers of full-length ISs. The sequence divergence observed suggests that several waves of IS invasion and elimination have occurred over evolutionary time (Cerveau et al., 2011) .",

ISs can undergo massive expansion and loss accompanied by gene inactivation and decay, genome rearrangement and genome reduction. Clearly, host lifestyle strongly influences these IS-mediated effects on genome structure, presumably by determining the level of genetic isolation of the microbial population. Factors affecting this include: whether the bacteria are ectosymbionts, primary endosymbionts having long evolutionary histories with their hosts, or secondary endosymbionts with more recent associations; whether they are transmitted in a strictly vertical manner or pass through a step of horizontal transfer via reinfection or passage through a second host vector (Bordenstein & Reznikoff, 2005; Moya et al., 2008) . IS expansion has been commonly observed in bacteria with recently adopted fastidious, host-restricted lifestyles. Those which may have more ancient host-restricted lifestyles (e.g. Wigglesworthia in the Tsetse fly; Buchnera aphidicola in the aphid; Blochmannia floridanus in the ant) tend to possess small streamlined genomes with few pseudogenes or MGEs (see (Bordenstein & Reznikoff, 2005; Moya et al., 2008) ; Supporting Information, Table  S1 ).",

Clearly, the activities of MGEs, and of ISs in particular, make them important instruments in these processes. IS expansion would contribute to pseudogenisation by IS-mediated intrachromosomal recombination and genome reduction (Andersson & Andersson, 1999; Lawrence et al., 2001; Mira et al., 2001) by their capacities to generate deletions (Mahillon & Chandler, 1998) .

However, evidence has been presented that they have been subjected to several waves of invasion and elimination of ISs (Cerveau et al., 2011) . This may be related to the fact that they are not strictly transmitted vertically but may also undergo relatively low levels of horizontal transmission and coinfection. Other symbionts or host-restricted bacteria also contain high IS loads. These include organisms such as Orientia tsutsugamushi, various Rickettsia, Sodalis glossinidius, Amoebophilus asiaticus 5a2, the c1 symbiont of the marine oligochaete Olavius algarvensis, the Bacteroidete Cardinium hertigii, a symbiont of the parasitic wasp Encarsia pergandiella, and the primary symbionts of grain weevils. These obligate intracellular bacteria may carry intercellular MGEs such as phage Read et al., 2000) and conjugative elements (Blanc et al., 2007) capable of acting as IS vectors and motors of horizontal gene transfer. Similar arguments might be used for other niche-restricted prokaryotes to explain increased IS loads found in some extremophiles (e.g. Sulfolobus solfataricus and certain cyanobacteria) (Brugger et al., 2004; Filee et al., 2007) (Papke et al., 2003; Allewalt et al., 2006) .",

This raises the possibility that transposase expression is deregulated in this symbiont system. However, another symbiont, Amoebophilus asiaticus, with a high IS load, shows no evidence of recent transposition activity in spite of extensive IS transcription (Schmitz-Esser et al., 2011) . In view of the time scales involved, only a very small but sustained increase in transposition activity might be needed to give rise to the high loads observed. Further exploration of the relationship between IS gene expression and transposition activity is clearly essential to understanding the dynamics of ISs in these and other systems.",

Initially, it was often assumed that TE show no or perhaps only low sequence specificity in their choice of a target. While this remains approximately true, the enormous increase in available sequences has provided more statistically robust data which have revealed that several TE use rather subtle mechanisms in choosing a target. Inspection of the public databases suggests that IS density is significantly higher in bacterial plasmids than in their host chromosomes and it seems likely that plasmids are major vectors in IS transmission (as well as in transmission of accessory traits such as resistance to antibacterials). Indeed, plasmids, in particular those that use a rolling circle mechanism either for replication or in conjugation, appear to be preferential targets for certain TE. For example, transposon Tn7 has two modes of transposition: in one, a specific sequence within the highly conserved glmS is recognised and insertion occurs next to this essential gene (Craig, 2002) ; in the second, insertion occurs into replication forks directed by interactions with the b-clamp (Parks et al., 2009) . This results in a strong orientation bias of Tn7 insertions, consistent with insertion into the lagging strand of the replication fork formed during conjugative transfer. Although studies with IS are less advanced, a similar orientation bias was observed with IS903 (Hu & Derbyshire, 1998) , suggesting that it too may use the b-clamp in directing insertions. It seems probable that many other IS use this type of protein-protein interaction.",

These transpose using a strand-specific single-strand intermediate and insertion occurs 3 0 to a tetra-or penta-nucleotide on the lagging strand . Clear vestiges of this specificity can still be detected in a large number of bacterial genomes where the orientation of insertion is strongly correlated with the direction of replication. There are clearly incidences of insertion in the 'wrong' orientation, but many of these may be explained by postinsertion genome rearrangements involving inversions. This would place the 'active' strand of the IS on the lagging rather than on the leading strand. Interestingly, those IS that are not oriented in the 'correct' orientation with respect to replication are almost certainly inactive and unable to transpose further .

The CLUSTALW multiple alignment algorithm (Thompson et al., 1994) is then used and the results displayed using the Jalview alignment editor (Clamp et al., 2004) for assessment. The corresponding DNA together with 1000 base pairs upstream and downstream is then extracted and examined manually for the IRs or other typical features such as secondary structures and flanking DRs. This, together with comparison of the DNA extremities of various elements, allows identification of both ends of the collected elements. In cases where more than a single IS copy is identified, BLASTN can be used to define the IS ends. Where only a single copy is found, the ends can often be defined by identifying and comparing with empty sites.",

They end with imperfect IRs and generate short flanking DRs on insertion (Table 1 ). The DR length is specific for each IS type. There are clearly several dominant families among the DDE IS group. These include IS3, whose Tpases are perhaps the most closely related to the retroviral integrase catalytic core (IN) by the spacing of the DDE triad and by the appearance of additional conserved residues [e.g. (Haren et al., 1999) ]. The IS3 family contains several well-defined clades delimiting subgroups. With subsequent accumulation of additional members, it has been necessary to redefine several large families, such as IS4, into a number of individual families (De Palmenaer et al., 2004) . A similar situation has also occurred for the IS5 family (Table 1; Fig 1) whose original members are at present distributed over several families and subgroups.

Little is known about their transposition mechanism. However, it appears likely, in view of the known activities of resolvases (Grindley, 2002) , that IS607 transposition may involve a circular double-strand DNA intermediate [N.D.F. Grindley cited as pers. commun. in (Filee et al., 2007) ]. Members of this family also occur in a group of giant eukaryotic viruses, the nucleocytoplasmic large DNA viruses (NCLDV). These infect protists whose lifestyle involves grazing on various bacteria (Fil ee et al., 2007) . They have presumably been incorporated into the viral genomes together with other bacterial genes by virtue of the highly promiscuous recombination properties of the virus. Interestingly, copies of IS607-like elements have more recently been identified in several 'lower' eukaryote genomes (Rolland et al., 2009; Gilbert & Cordaux, 2013) . Most are incomplete although complete copies were identified in the genomes of the protist Acanthamoeba castellani and the alga Ectocarpus siliculosus (Gilbert & Cordaux, 2013) (Boocock & Rice, 2013) . These are closely related to the cyanobacterial ISArma1. In addition to the transposase, members of this family also sometimes include a tnpB gene similar to those carried by the IS200/ IS605 family (Kersulyte et al., 2000) .",

They are included here because certain family members resemble ISs (e.g. IS1071) as they encode only the transposase. However, the replicative transposition mechanism of this family involves formation of a cointegrate in which donor and recipient replicons are fused and separated at each junction with a directly repeated transposon copy (Grindley et al., 2006) . These structures must be 'resolved', by recombination between the two transposon copies, to generate the donor and target replicons each retaining a single transposon copy. This is accomplished by a 'resolvase', a site-specific recombinase which acts at a unique DNA sequence in the transposon, the Res site. While many Tn3 family members encode a serine recombinase, several are now known to carry a tyrosine site-specific recombinase (TnpI in Tn4655 and Tn4330) (Vanhooff et al., 2006) resembling phage integrases. Moreover, a third group of Tn3 family members include two genes, TnpS and TnpT (Yano et al., 2013) . It is possible that, as for the bacteriophage k which uses a Y site-specific recombinase (Int) for integration together with a second protein, Xis for excision, TnpT is involved in assuring directionality in transposition.

At least some incomplete ISs presently identified in sequenced genomes may be of this type because the second IS end would occur at an unexpectedly distant position and would not necessarily have been identified.",

Moreover, more than one closely related but nonidentical derivative can be found in a single genome (e.g. ISSpo3, and ISSpo8 in Silicibacter pomeroyi DSS-3 and ISNwi4 and ISNha5 in Nitrobacter winograski Nb-255). Others are present in more than one copy. ISPre3, an IS66 relative from Pseudomonas resinovorans plasmid pCAR1 includes a hypothetical protein and is present as 2 copies with different insertion sites as judged by their typical 8 bp DRs (E. Gourbeyre, unpublished). The mechanisms involved in acquisition of additional genes to generate tISs are at present unclear. They do not appear to carry programmed recombination systems as do some members of the Tn3 family (see 'ISs with accessory genes: Tn3 family' above). One possibility is that tISs are derived by deletion from ancestral compound transposons. These are composed of two ISs flanking any DNA segment either in direct or inverted orientation . The flanking ISs are able to mobilise the intervening DNA segment. They were among the first types of transposon described and include the models Tn5 (flanking IS50) and Tn10 (flanking IS10) as well as Tn9 (flanking IS1). As these early examples, many other such composite transposons have been identified either by experiment or from genome sequencing (Tn number registry:",

            "text": "Other structures which obscure the definition of an IS have been identified among various TEs. For example, ICEs (integrative conjugative elements) are found integrated into the host genome but can excise and transfer from cell to cell. Their insertion and excision are generally catalysed by enzymes related to site-specific recombinases, whereas their transfer depends on a second set of proteins, which includes a 'relaxase', often a single-strand endonuclease of the HUH superfamily (Burrus et al., 2002) . However, ISSag10, a tIS member of the IS1595 family from Streptococcus agalactiae which includes an O-lincosamide nucleotidyltransferase gene, encodes a DDE transposase and undergoes cell-tocell transfer when complemented with an autonomous ICE, Tn916 (Achard & Leclercq, 2007) . In this case, a cryptic origin of transfer is located within the 3 0 end of the resistance gene. These nonautonomous ICEs have been called IMEs [integrative mobilisable elements; (Adams et al., 2002) ] or cis-mobilisable elements [CIMEs; (Pavlovic et al., 2004) ]. More recent studies have identified a new ICE family, transposon of Group B Streptococcus (TnGBS), in which the enzyme catalysing their integration and excision belongs to another DDE-group Tpase (Brochet et al., 2009; Guerillot et al., 2013) . Indeed, this has led to the identification of an entirely new family of classic ISs carrying DDE Tpases, the ISLre2 family (Guerillot et al., 2014) . In addition to the TnGBS family, other ICEs have been identified which include a DDE Tpase closely related to that of the IS30 family (Smyth & Robinson, 2009 ). It seems likely that examples of ICEs with other IS family Tpases are awaiting identification. Moreover, in addition to a variety of transfer functions, certain ICEs carry plasmid-related replication genes important in ensuring sufficient stability of the transposition intermediates to enable their subsequent integration Guerillot et al., 2013) . Indeed, early examples of ICEs (Murphy & Pembroke, 1995) were initially thought to be resistance plasmids and assigned an incompatibility group, incJ. These are maintained as an integrated copy in the host chromosome but can nevertheless give rise to circular copies (Pembroke & Murphy, 2000) . This is yet another example of the increasingly indistinct frontiers between phage, plasmids and transposons (Bi et al., 2012) (http:// db-mml.sjtu.edu.cn/ICEberg/).",

Although it has yet to be demonstrated that such structures indeed transpose, ISCRs are associated with multiple flanking antibiotic resistance genes. It is thought that these genes are transmitted during the rolling circle type of transposition mechanism postulated to occur in IS91 transposition. This involves an initiation event at one IS end, polarised transfer of the IS strand into a target molecule and termination at the second end (Garcillan- . Flanking gene acquisition is thought to occur when the termination mechanism fails and rolling circle transposition extends into neighbouring DNA where it may encounter a second surrogate end . This type of mobile element may prove to play an important role in the assembly and transmission of multiple antibiotic resistance (Toleman et al., 2006) (Toleman & Walsh, 2011 (Feschotte et al., 2002) are related to ISs with DDE Tpases (Fig. 4a) . They are composed of two appropriately oriented left and right ends similar to those of ISs. They are generally < 300 bp long and are probably derived from ISs by internal deletion. Some carry short noncoding sequences between these IRs which may or may not be IS-derived. Others carry various coding sequences and have been called MICs (De Palmenaer et al., 2004) . MITEs are considered to be nonautonomous TEs mobilisable in trans by Tpases of full-length parental genomic copies. They were first identified in plants (Feschotte et al., 2002) and are related to Tc/mariner elements (distantly related to bacterial IS630 family). IS630-related MITEs were also the first described bacterial examples (Correia et al., 1988; Oggioni & Claverys, 1999; Buisine et al., 2002) . MITEs showing similarities to other IS families have now been observed in bacteria and archaea (Brugger et al., 2002; Filee et al., 2007) . Among those derived from ISs with DDE transposases, representatives of the IS1, IS4, IS5, IS6, and even Tn3 family members such as ISRf1 from Sinorhizobium fredii have been identified.",

This is known as the transferred strand because the 3 0 OH is used as a nucleophile in the integration step to attack the target phophodiester bond and complete strand transfer. However, transposition of these ISs occurs via doublestrand DNA intermediates and therefore requires processing of the second strand (called the nontransferred strand) to liberate the IS from flanking DNA sequences in the donor molecule. This can occur in several different ways and is also IS family-specific (Turlan & Chandler, 2000; Curcio & Derbyshire, 2003) (Table 1 ) and serves to reinforce groupings derived from bioinformatics comparison by providing a mechanistic coherence. Thus, for ISs of the IS4 family (IS50, IS10), the initial 3 0 OH is used to attack the opposite strand forming a transient hairpin bridge at the IS end. This is then cleaved using H 2 O as a nucleophile to liberate the IS and regenerate the 3 0 OH on the transferred strand ready for strand transfer and integration. This is known as a cut-and-paste mechanism. Other ISs such as the IS630 family, related to the eukaryote mariner/Tc superfamily, employ a mechanism in which the initial H 2 O-catalysed cleavage of the nontransferred strand occurs with a small offset of 2 bases into the IS prior to cleavage of the transferred strand (Feng & Colloms, 2007) as do their eukaryotic cousins (Richardson et al., 2009 ).",

This has been adopted by a significant number of IS families including IS3, IS30, IS110, IS256, ISLre2 and possibly others. IS1 uses this as one of several transposition pathways (Turlan & Chandler, 1995) . For IS3 family members, circle formation occurs in an asymmetric manner. One IS end is cleaved to generate the characteristic 3 0 OH of the transferred strand. This then serves to attack several nucleotides exterior to the second end to generate a single-strand bridge leaving a free 3 0 OH on the IS flank. The 3 0 OH can act as a replication primer. IS replication would regenerate an intact copy reconstituting the donor plasmid and produce a double-strand circular DNA intermediate. Due to low basal Tpase levels, this initial step may occur in a stochastic manner. However, formation of the circular intermediate results in the assembly of a transient strong promoter composed of a -35 promoter element in the right IS end oriented outwards and a -10 promoter element in the left end oriented inwards (Ton-Hoang et al., 1997) . This promoter serves to drive transposase synthesis and consequent integration and disassembly of the promoter. Thus, the circular intermediate once generated is committed to terminate transposition.",

These promote single-strand transposition Ton-Hoang et al., 2005) in contrast to DDE enzymes, which catalyse double-strand transposition. They form obligatory dimers in which the catalytic site is composed of an HUH motif from one monomer and a single Y residue together with the third residue necessary for coordinating the essential divalent metal ion contributed by the second monomer . Although the founding family member, IS200, was identified in Salmonella 30 years ago (Lam & Roth, 1983) , their activities have only recently been unravelled Ton-Hoang et al., 2005 Barabas et al., 2008; Guynet et al., 2008 Guynet et al., , 2009 . Two model ISs, IS608 from Helicobacter pylori and ISDra2 (Hickman et al., 2010a, b; Pasternak et al., 2010; Ton-Hoang et al., 2010) from D. radiodurans [IS8301 in (Islam et al., 2003) ] have been studied in detail. Both use obligatory circular ssDNA intermediates for their mobility. They excise as ssDNA circles with abutted left and right ends and insert 3 0 to a conserved element-specific penta-or tetra-nucleotide target (Guynet et al., 2009) . As the transposon is 'peeled' from its donor site as a single strand, this mechanism might be called 'peel-and-paste' (B. Ton-Hoang pers. commun.). The target sequence is essential for further transposition . The transposase, TnpA, recognises small, subterminal hairpin structures in a strand-specific manner and catalyses single-strand cleavage at both ends on the 'top' strand. Surprisingly, the left and right cleavage sites are not directly recognised by TnpA. Instead, they form a network of particular base interactions with short 'guide' sequences located 5 0 to the TnpA-bound subterminal secondary structures at each end. This network includes both canonical (Watson-Crick) and noncanonical base interactions He et al., 2011 ) (Hickman et al., 2010a . These are also essential to stabilise the nucleoprotein complex, the transpososome, within which the DNA strand cleavages and transfers occur. Indeed, changes in the guide sequences result in predictable changes in insertion site specificity (Guynet et al., 2009) .",

            "text": "For DDE transposases, the domains of the protein which ensure sequence-specific DNA binding (i.e. to the IS ends) are typically located towards the N-terminal (N-terminal) end and the catalytic domain more towards the C-terminal (C-terminal) end. From a functional point of view, this arrangement facilitates a phenomenon called cotranslational DNA binding in which the protein folds in the course of translation allowing the nascent polypeptide chain to initiate binding directly to the closest IS end. Indeed, for members of a number of IS families, including IS1 (Zerbib et al., 1987) , IS3 (Haren et al., 1998) , IS30 (Stalder et al., 1990) , the isolated DNA-binding domain bind more avidly than the entire protein, suggesting that the C-terminal end may actually inhibit specific binding by the N-terminal domain, possibly by steric masking. Once bound, the N-terminal domain would be insensitive to C-terminal domain masking. Thus, specific Tpase binding would only occur transitorily early during translation providing an attractive explanation for the preferential cis activity (the preference to act on the TE from which the Tpase is expressed) of many Tpases (Duval-Valentin & Chandler, 2011) . Both Helix-turn-Helix (HTH) and ZF domains have been implicated as DNA-binding domains (e.g. IS911 (Rousseau et al., 2004) ; IS1 (Ohta et al., 2004; Ton-Hoang et al., 2004) . These can be found individually or together as illustrated in Fig. 6 .",

The active Tpase is dimeric and, in the published protein structures, the active site is composed of the HUH motif of one monomer and the active site tyrosine of the other. The tyrosine residue is located downstream of the HUH on an a-helix joined to the body of the protein by a flexible arm. The a-helix also carries a third residue which, with the His pair, completes the amino acid triad essential for divalent metal ion binding Barabas et al., 2008) , (Hickman et al., 2010a, b) . Each Y residue in this 'trans' position cleaves one IS end generating a 5 0 phosphotyrosine bond. Strand transfer is then thought to occur by rotation of the flexible arms so that the Y residue covalently linked to DNA engages with the HUH of the same monomer, a 'cis' configuration. The cleavage reaction is then reversed resulting in strand transfer and the enzyme then appears to be reset in the trans configuration (He et al., 2013) . The overall organisation of the much larger Y2 enzymes is less well determined although there is a ZF motif which possibly functions as a DNA recognition domain located in the N-terminal region .",

This is clearly illustrated by the large spectrum of interrelated mobile elements which are vehicles for antibiotic resistance. In addition to the numerous 'classical' composite transposons with flanking ISs and unit transposons such as those of the large Tn3 family, we have described autonomous (tISs) and nonautonomous (MICs) IS derivatives, integrative conjugative elements (ICEs) with IS-like Tpases (Brochet et al., 2009) and ISCR with IS91-like HUH Tpases and multiple resistance genes both upstream and downstream of the Tpase (Toleman et al., 2006) .

This involves both endogenous elements and those accumulated by horizontal transfer. Our present understanding of the way in which ISs shape genomes is based largely on descriptive studies which often employ inaccurately annotated genomes. To obtain a more dynamic picture of the forces involved and the processes shaping a genome, it is necessary to understand the detailed mechanism(s) of IS movement; their target sites, that is, whether they prefer replication forks, actively transcribed regions, plasmids, chromosomes, specific DNA sequences or secondary structures and in what combinations; the interactions (interference) between elements; involvement of host factors etc. There have been few attempts to understand these factors and even fewer attempts to integrate them.",

The role of genome isolation in IS expansion is an excellent example. To understand TE behaviour, there is a need to build quantitative multiscale models (Dada & Mendes, 2011) rather than descriptive models. This is a challenging task because this type of systems biology approach will require incorporation of a large number of very diverse parameters. At one level, this involves considerations such as how the DNA spreads through communities, the regulatory circuitry including the signals involved in DNA transfer between cells, the nature and function of the acquired mobile DNA, the way in which cells deal with the 'intrusion' of newly introduced genes and how they accommodate the associated changes in fitness. On a second level, it requires knowledge of the fine regulatory circuits determining TE movement itself, both biochemical and temporal, how this depends on various aspects of host physiology (interaction with DNA structural proteins, with replication repair and the cell cycle, with different chromosomal domains) and to what extent there may be interaction/interference between different TEs in the same cell.",
