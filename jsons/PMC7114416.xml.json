Based on genotypic and serological analyses, CoVs are divides into 3 genera; alpha-, beta- and gamma-coronaviruses (Carstens, 2009). Alpha- and beta-coronaviruses have been isolated from mammals, while gamma-coronaviruses cause avian infectious bronchitis (IBV), as well as the genetically closely related Turkey coronavirus (Cao et al., 2008, Cavanagh et al., 2001, Gomaa et al., 2008, Guy, 2000) and pheasant coronavirus (Cavanagh et al., 2002). Numerous variants and serotypes of IBV continue to be discovered in poultry flocks worldwide (Cavanagh et al., 1988, Cavanagh et al., 1992, Dolz et al., 2006, Farsang et al., 2002, Gelb et al., 1991, Han et al., 2011, Wang and Huang, 2000) that cause infectious bronchitis (IB), which is responsible for mortality in young chickens, economic losses due to poor weight gain, and a reduction in the egg quality and quantity (Cavanagh and Gelb, 2008).",

            "text": "Like the typical genomic organization found in other gamma-coronaviruses, the 3\u2032 end of the IBV genome contains the main structural genes; the spike glycoprotein (S), the small membrane protein (E), the integral membrane protein (M), and the nucleocapsid protein (N), as well as several accessory genes, usually in the order S-Gene 3-E-M-Gene 5-N (Boursnell et al., 1987). The S1 subunit of the S protein carries virus-neutralizing and serotype-specific determinants, but it exhibits high sequence diversity among different IBV serotypes. By contrast, the N protein is highly conserved with 91.0\u201396.5% similarity in different IBV strains (William et al., 1992). Its primary function is the formation of the viral ribonucleoprotein complex, but it is also considered that the IBV N protein is multifunctional. Its intracellular localization suggests that it is a likely component of the coronavirus replication and transcription complex. Furthermore, the N protein can induce high titers of cross-reactive antibodies and cell-mediated immunity, which protects chickens from acute infections (Ignjatovic and Galli, 1994, Seo et al., 1997, Tang et al., 2008). Most of the IBV N protein is composed of 409 amino acids with a predicted molecular weight of 45 kDa. The N protein is a phosphoprotein that can bind viral RNA with high affinity (Chen et al., 2005) and it is expressed abundantly during infections (Cavanagh, 2005). Thus, it is a target protein when designing infectious bronchitis (IB) vaccines (Tian et al., 2008) and a frequent target of diagnostic applications (Chen et al., 2003, Gibertoni et al., 2005, Ndifuna et al., 1998). However, most of the diagnostic assays had been focused on the antibody detection using recombinant N proteins. In the sampling practices in poultry farms in China, it is very common to take tracheal swabs to look for respiratory virus infections, though it is also very common to take blood samples to detect antibody. Hence, new assays focusing on virus detection, such as using mAb(s) against N protein, would be an improvement on current available diagnostic assays.",

            "text": "Na\u00efve B-cells, which are the principal agents of humoral immune responses, are stimulated by the specific recognition and binding of B-cell receptors to a region of the antigen known as the epitope. Together with co-stimulation by T-lymphocytes, na\u00efve B-cells become fully activated then proliferate and differentiate into memory and plasma cells, while the latter act as key engines for producing specific antibodies. The identification and mapping of B-cell epitopes on antigens has been a subject of intense research because knowledge of these markers has profound implications for the development of peptide-based diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines. B-cell epitopes may consist of linear, contiguous stretches of amino acids in a protein, or they can be discontinuous stretches of amino acids that are brought together spatially via protein folding. The majority of B-cell epitopes are discontinuous in nature, but difficulties in the design of such epitopes have led to an emphasis on the identification of linear B-cell epitopes. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are used widely as powerful tools for identifying linear epitopes, or for mimicking the epitopes of a variety of infectious agents (Deng et al., 2007, Kaverin et al., 2007, Zhang et al., 2011). In this study, we prepared mAbs against the N protein of IBV strain tl/CH/LDT3/03I and used them to screen for linear B-cell epitopes. The results provided important insights that could facilitate the development of possible specific diagnostics for IBV infection and that further our understanding of the antigenic structure of N protein.",

To investigate the reactivity of the 2 mAbs, 25 heterogeneous IBV strains, i.e., 20 field strains and 5 vaccine strains, were used as representatives of different IBV types (Liu et al., 2006, Ma et al., 2012).

The epitope of 4F10 was mapped by peptide scanning, as previously described (Yu et al., 2010). The strategy for expressing IBV N and truncated N fragments is shown in Fig. 4A. The entire N gene and its truncated fragments were expressed as GST fusion proteins in E. coli BL21 (DE3). All of the proteins were expressed successfully and they were tested by SDS-PAGE of the cell lysates after induction with IPTG. The GST fusion proteins were used for fine level mapping of the epitope of the IBV tl/CH/LDT3/03 antigen recognized by 4F10 (Fig. 4). Western blotting showed that the minimal recognition sequence was 195DLIARAAKI203, because a deletion of D195 or I203 destroyed the binding of mAb 4F10 to the GST fusion peptides (Fig. 4B). A similar reactivity was observed with ELISA using truncated peptides as coating antigens, which further confirmed that the linear epitope recognized in the N protein of IBV strain tl/CH/LDT3/03 by 4F10 appeared to be localized in 195DLIARAAKI203.",

To the best of our knowledge, these 2 epitopes are the first finely mapped B-cell epitopes for the IBV N protein. In a previous study, Seah et al. (2000) used 12 fragments of the N gene expressed by E. coli, which were coupled with chicken convalescent sera against Australia T, China Ch5, Singapore P4, USA M41, and China T3 isolates, to map the linear immunodominant epitopes of N protein into 3 regions that covered amino acid residues 175\u2013241, 310\u2013370, and 360\u2013409, although these epitopes were not finely mapped.

This discrepancy may be because different viruses were used as the antigens for generating convalescent sera or mAbs. The serotype tl/CH/LDT3/03 (Liu et al., 2005) used in our study was also a different serotype from those used by Seah et al. (2000).",

Remarkably, the phylogenetic relationship among IBV strains based on the N gene did not parallel those based on the S1 genes (Han et al., 2011), which may be explained by recombination events in the genomes of IBV strains (Jackwood et al., 2010). There was a lack of IBV strains in group V in our laboratory (this group only contained viruses isolated in Australia) and the 18 viruses selected in this study only came from the four remaining groups (groups I\u2013IV). Nevertheless, all of the heterologous IBV strains selected were well recognized by the 2 mAbs, which suggested that the epitopes recognized by the 2 mAbs were conserved among the heterologous IBV strains.

The detection of IBV infections of poultry flocks is a major challenge because of the difficulty in differentiating this condition from other upper respiratory diseases. Thus, appropriate diagnostic methods are needed and they are an important tool for taking appropriate preventive steps. Another problem that complicates IBV detection and diagnosis is the existence of multiple serotypes of IBV, which co-circulate in vaccinated and non-vaccinated chicken flocks (Liu and Kong, 2004). The astonishing diversity of IBV in chickens is probably a result of the higher mutation rate of RNA viruses due to the infidelity of their polymerases and higher opportunity for recombination because of their unique replication mechanism, which suggests that there are probably many other unknown types and that many more will emerge in chickens.",

However, because the 2 mAbs can recognize both field isolates and commonly used vaccine strains, they can not be used for developing diagnostic molecular assays to differentiate between field isolates and vaccines. In addition, we have identified a small amount of variations across both epitopes by comparing IBV N gene sequences in the GenBank database. However, because of the limited IBV strains available in our laboratory, we only tested cross-reactivity of 18 heterogeneous IBV strains which contained identical sequences over the epitope regions. In the future study, we will generate a series recombinant N proteins by mutating the GST-N constructs according to the sequence variations across both epitopes to identify the reactivity of the two antibodies to non-identical sequences of N proteins. Nevertheless, the development of these diagnostic assays will be very challenging.",
