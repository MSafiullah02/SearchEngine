It describes incerneration, chemical treatment, autoclaving, microwaving, and shredding/compacting. Performance issues, environmental impact, and perspectives from several developing countries are described. In seeking effective solutions for the disposal of medical wastes in developing-world health-care settings, it is necessary to design and build a sustainable system for managing medical waste. All approaches to the management of medical waste must consider the environmental, financial, and technical feasibility of treatment and disposal technologies in the context of the following requirements: (1) Resolve the most critical factors first: Needle-stick injuries and exposure to pathogens. (2) Identify affordable and cost-effective solutions in each specific health-care situation. (3) Consider technical feasibility within the existing health and sanitation infrastructure. (4) Prioritize best environmental practices, considering local infrastructure.",
