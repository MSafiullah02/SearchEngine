The management of LVAD-supported patients for noncardiac surgery presents many challenges, and case reports of patients with LVADs who underwent several different types of noncardiac surgeries have been published [3\u201310]. However, none of these cases reported the perioperative management of video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS). Here, we present the case of a patient with a continuous-flow LVAD in whom VATS and resection of a bulla were successfully completed.",

To facilitate endotracheal intubation using a left-sided double lumen tube Broncho-Cath\u2122 (Mallinckrodt Medical, Athlone, Ireland), 50 mg of rocuronium bromide was administered. We did not administer additional muscle relaxants except when a 10 mg maintenance dose of rocuronium bromide was used just after the patient was placed into the left lateral decubitus position, and 20 mg rocuronium bromide was administered just before the first incision. The train-of-four was measured for neuromuscular monitoring throughout the operation. A central line was inserted in the right jugular vein. The patient\u2019s ABP and central venous pressure (CVP) were continuously monitored using invasive means. Electrocardiography showed the sinus rhythm supported by the pacemaker, but the mode was changed from DDD to DOO at the heart rate of 80 bpm to avoid interference of electrocautery. Defibrillator pads were attached because implantable cardioverter defibrillator detection was inactivated. A transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) probe was placed for monitoring the performance of the LVAD and to determine intraoperative cardiac function. Initial findings included severely dilated left ventricle (LV) and right ventricle (RV), bowing of the intraventricular septum into the RV (Fig. 3), reduced LV and RV wall motion [RV-fractional area change (FAC) 16.8%], severe mitral regurgitation, continuous closed aortic valves, no aortic regurgitation, and trivial tricuspid regurgitation (TR) after TAP. The inflow cannula, anastomosed to the apex of the LV, and the outflow cannula, attached to the ascending aorta, of the LVAD were unobstructed with low flow velocities of 90.2 cm/s and 87.3 cm/s on pulse wave and color Doppler analyses, respectively. The right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP) was estimated at 21 mmHg by measuring the TR jet maximum velocity. First, arterial gas analysis showed the following results: pH 7.437, pCO2 31.1 mmHg, pO2 225 mmHg, BEecf 2.7, lactate 0.7 mmol/L, SaO2 99% and Hb 9.2 g/dL at FiO2 of 0.5.\n",

The external portion of driveline was not kinked. As the patient was coughing slightly, 10 mg rocuronium bromide was administered, and the dose of remifentanil was increased. TEE examination revealed an almost akinetic LV, free wall RV, and a flattened intraventricular septum. The inflow and outflow cannulas of the LVAD were noted to be in the proper position with a pulsatile flow of approximately 60 cm/s and 110 cm/s, respectively. We assessed that the patient needed inotropic support, and hence, the administration of dobutamine (3.3 \u03bcg/kg/min) and milrinone (0.2 \u03bcg/kg/min) was initiated. Gradually, the CVP returned to 12 mmHg, and TEE showed improved LV and RV motions, with rightward shift of the intraventricular septum. At the beginning of OLV, the pressure-controlled ventilation mode was adjusted; peak inspiratory pressure and positive end-expiratory pressure were changed from 17 cmH2O to 28 cmH2O and from 5 cmH2O to 7 cmH2O, respectively, to maintain saturation of percutaneous oxygen (SpO2) above 90%. After insertion of the access ports, SpO2 decreased to 91% at FiO2 of 1.0, pump power consumption increased to 3.5 watts, and the CVP reached 20 mmHg, when the mean ABP was maintained at approximately 85 mmHg (Fig. 4 (B)). TEE showed severely reduced RV motion, and the intraventricular septum had again shifted slightly to the left side. The RVSP was calculated at 35 mmHg, whereas the RV-FAC was calculated at 17.7% and appeared to be near the pre-OLV level. For further support of right heart function, continuous intravenous infusion of milrinone was increased to 0.4 \u03bcg/kg/min. Arterial blood gas analysis at this time revealed the following results: pH 7.357, pCO2 42.9 mmHg, pO2 67.9 mmHg, BEecf \u2212 1.4, lactate 0.6 mmol/L, SaO2 96.7% and Hb 10.2 g/dL at FiO2 1.0. After a couple of min, TEE examination showed that the LV and RV motions had slightly improved, and the intraventricular septum had shifted toward the RV. Reflecting gradually improved RV wall motion, the RV-FAC was found to be 33.8%. With the increase in urine output, oxygenation improved and CVP decreased to 10 mmHg. The TEE findings did not change, and the mean ABP was maintained at 64\u201385 mmHg. The pulsatile waveforms were maintained on ABP and SpO2 throughout the operation. Intraoperatively, the EVAHEART\u00ae monitor showed that the pump speed was set at 1700 rpm; the pump power consumption was 2\u20134 W. The VATS was completed successfully with stable hemodynamic conditions.\n",

The total OLV time was 3 h 6 min, with an operation time of 3 h 5 min, necessitating a fluid input of 1320 ml crystalloids. The total urine output and blood loss measured were 2550 ml and 23 ml, respectively. Before recovery from general anesthesia, the TEE findings and LVAD parameters showed unremarkable changes in the supine position. The neuromuscular blockade was reversed with sugammadex sodium. After extubation, the patient did not experience pain and could breathe deeply. The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit in stable condition. However, he needed temporary bilevel positive airway pressure support after several hours. Moreover, postoperative pneumonia was suspected on postoperative day 2, and a change in the antibiotic protocol was needed. Finally, he recovered in 1 week and was discharged from our hospital in stable condition on postoperative day 37.",

However, OLV could lead to higher PVR, induced by possible complications such as hypoxemia and hypercarbia, where the RV encounters sudden changes in afterload, preload, and contractility [14]. Therefore, based on the findings of previous studies [3\u201310], the management of LVAD-supported patients for VATS may be more challenging than that of LVAD-supported patients undergoing noncardiac surgeries, as there may be sudden OLV-associated, deteriorative RV function.",

NO is administered as a pharmacological intervention to treat right heart failure caused by pulmonary hypertension [15, 16].

It was considered that the patient potentially had higher thrombotic risk because the preoperative LVIDD of the patient was measured at 7.7 cm, although EVAHEART\u00ae is a centrifugal LVAD. Conversely, in multivariable models, the hazard of stroke was higher with the CC device regardless of LVIDD [19]. In addition, interruption of anticoagulation due to the bleeding risk associated with an elective procedure may also lead to an elevated risk of thromboembolism, even if heparin bridging is implemented. A recent study recommended an extended personalized approach that incorporates the extent of the patient\u2019s underlying risk for thrombosis and bleeding [20].",

In this case, we considered that a PAC was not necessary because the patient showed no evidence of pulmonary hypertension and his right heart function was sufficiently preserved to resist the increase in PVR associated with OLV. In addition, TEE was anticipated to replace PAC because TEE can provide quantification of pulmonary artery systolic pressure by the trans-tricuspid pressure gradient, which is a reliable method compared to PAC [15]. Practically, in conjunction with CVP, TEE was useful to assess the deteriorative hemodynamic changes following OLV and change in patient position and to guide fluid therapy and inotropic drug administration. However, PAC should be considered in cases of pulmonary hypertension and/or highly predictable hemodynamic instability during surgery because of progressive right heart failure, for example, for a LVAD patient with low PAP and high CVP [13] .",
