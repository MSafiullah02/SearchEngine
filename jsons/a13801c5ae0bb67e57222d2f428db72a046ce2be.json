A necessary and sufficient condition on the values of curing and infection rates for the healthy state to be exponentially stable is obtained via the analysis of signed Laplacians when the control input is the curing budget of a single agent. In the case when the healthy state is stabilizable, an explicit expression for the minimum curing budget is provided. The utility of the algorithm is demonstrated using a simulation over a network of cities in the northeastern United States.",

There are two interpretations of these models and their states: 1) that each node is a subpopulation and the state is a proportion of infected individuals in the corresponding subpopulation (Lajmanovich and Yorke, 1976; Fall et al., 2007), or 2) that each node is a single individual and the state is the probability of that individual being infected (Mieghem et al., 2009) .

(2014) ; Watkins et al. (2018) ; Mai et al. (2018) ; Drakopoulos et al. (2014) , to name a few. Drakopoulos et al. (2014) proposed a dynamic curing policy for containment of a contagion process modeled by a continuous Markov process. It was shown that if the CutWidth of the underlying graph is sublinear in the number of nodes, the proposed policy achieved sublinear expected time to extinction. Borgs et al. (2010) studied the epidemic threshold when the antidote was distributed non-uniformly. Wan et al. (2007 Wan et al. ( , 2008 proposed and implemented distributed control techniques for setting healing rates and quarantine protocols on a severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) simulation model. The work of Khanafer et al. (2016) has proposed an antidote control technique. Preciado et al. (2014) and Watkins et al. (2018) developed an optimal vaccination control technique using geometric programming ideas. Mai et al. (2018) use distributed optimization to solve several formulations of curing resource allocation problems. The proposed algorithms by Mai et al. (2018) , while efficient and mostly distributed, all appeal to an additional, independent consensus process to calculate a piece of centralized information, and thus require a synchronous stopping time across the network. None of the other proposed algorithms in the literature are distributed. In fact, it has been shown by Liu et al. (2019) that a certain type of distributed feedback controller can never stabilize the healthy state.",

Consider the interpretation of the model where each node is a subpopulation; if a government has enough resources to treat only one subpopulation, this approach can show if the disease can be eradicated given that only one subpopulation can be treated, and if so, which is the best subpopulation to treat, and how much effort will be required to eradicate the disease. An analogous interpretation can also be made for a computer network to be protected by equipping virus patches on only one computer. In the case when the underlying graph is undirected, we obtain a necessary and sufficient condition for the healthy state to be exponentially stable via the mathematical tool of signed Laplacians. When the condition is satisfied, i.e., when the healthy state is stabilizable, we provide an explicit expression for the minimum control budget.",

Now the question becomes the following: if we are limited by our infrastructure and can treat only one city, which one is the best one and how much treatment is required? Implementing the algorithm from Corollary 1 to solve Problem (4), answers these questions. It turns out that the only node that meets the base requirement of L i 0 with a simple eigenvalue at zero is i = 5, that is, New York City (node 5). The minimum amount of control input that eradicates the virus is u 5 = 1.30. Including this control input in the system as in (3) results in the system converging to the healthy state, depicted in Figure 2 .",

In the case when the healthy state is stabilizable, an explicit expression for the minimum curing budget has been provided.

We have shown the utility of the proposed controller via simulation.",
