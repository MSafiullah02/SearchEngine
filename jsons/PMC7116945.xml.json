Negative results are not reported before 7 days of incubation and the method often renders false-positive results (Parker et al., 2003, Corbeil et al., 2008). Contamination of prepucia with fecal flora is a source of saprophytic protozoa such as Tetratrichomonas sp. and Pentatrichomonas hominis that grow in culture and mistakenly led to positive diagnosis (Taylor et al., 1994, Hayes et al., 2003, Dufernez et al., 2007). Staining techniques or phase contrast illumination may help in differentiating T. foetus from contaminant flagellated protozoa but such methods are prone to observer error (Lun et al., 2000, Taylor et al., 1994).",

Primers TFR1 and TFR2 anneal to sequences found in members of the Trichomonadidae family (Felleisen, 1997). The reaction yields a product of variable size that might help to differentiate T. foetus from other trichomonads, usually with assistance of a post-amplification technique such as restriction fragment length polymorphism (Hayes et al., 2003). The primer pair TFR3-TFR4 allows specific amplification of the 5.8S gene and flanking sequences ITS1 and ITS2 from T. foetus (Felleisen et al., 1998). Sensitivity of PCR detection of T. foetus was found similar to the culture technique and takes less than 5 h from DNA isolation to result analysis (Cobo et al., 2007, Mutto et al., 2006). However, the increase in sensitivity entails an increment in costs and higher technical skills.",

The LAMP test produces large amounts of DNA under isothermal conditions (60\u201365 \u00b0C) and it can be performed in a simple water bath. In addition, the high amount of DNA generated makes possible to evaluate the results by the naked eye (Dukes et al., 2006, Hill et al., 2008, Parida et al., 2005, Goto et al., 2009, Iwamoto et al., 2003). Unlike PCR tests, LAMP has shown high tolerance to biological fluids, implying that DNA purification might be dispensable (Poon et al., 2006, Kaneko et al., 2007).",

This microbiological procedure depends on pathogen viability and takes over a week to deliver conclusive results. Since contamination is not uncommon, especially with non-pathogenic trichomonads, it often results in false-positive diagnosis (Clark and Diamond, 2002). PCR approach based in the amplification of rDNA sequences helps for the rapid discrimination of T. foetus from other trichomonads (Felleisen et al., 1998). However, PCR requires precision instruments for the amplification and the sensitivity of the simplest test for T. foetus detection is overall comparable to the culture method (Cobo et al., 2007).",

Thus we were capable to control the presence of specific and non-specific target sequences. Four primers lead to specific amplification of T. foetus DNA in less than 2 h. Faster reactions can be obtained by adding loop primers that would initiate further DNA amplification from the stem-loop region (Nagamine et al., 2002). Nevertheless, we tested manually designed loop primers, without detecting any improvement in sensitivity or reducing the reaction time of the system. These results might be due to the already stem loop rich structure of ribosomal sequences. The knowledge of the parasite genome would make possible the design of new LAMP protocols based in other specific sequences.",

In a complex fluid (smegma), PCR amplification showed a dim band at 4.0 \u00d7 103\n cell/mL, while LAMP amplification was positive without decreasing the signal strength (Fig. 4). Such effect is a usual finding in LAMP reactions and might be explained by the high amount of DNA obtained by LAMP reactions, as it was previously reported, where isothermal amplification yielded almost 100 times more DNA than a PCR (Mori et al., 2001). On the other hand, sensitivity of PCR for T. foetus has been enhanced through enzyme linked assay (Felleisen et al., 1998), nested-PCR (Gookin et al., 2002, Fernandes et al., 2008) and real time PCR (McMillen and Lew, 2006, Dufernez et al., 2007). Nevertheless, LAMP for T. foetus detection is a technique conceived to perform DNA amplification with minimal equipment and the high sensitivity achieved (\u224810 parasites/reaction) could be used for direct diagnosis with minimal sample preparation. Up to now, LAMP is rapid, sensitive and specific as most molecular methods and it has found useful applications in diagnosis of virus, several pathogenic microorganisms and few parasites (Mori and Notomi, 2009).",
