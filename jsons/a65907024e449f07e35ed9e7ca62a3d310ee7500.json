            "text": "Preventive dermatology, which is claimed to play a key role in the global management of skin diseases, is not yet accepted as a routine procedure in many aspects of daily life [1] . The prevention of irritant and/or allergic contact dermatitis is briefly and incompletely reviewed in several textbooks on occupational and contact dermatitis [2, 3] . It is therefore imperative to view the prevention of occupational (and nonoccupational) dermatitis as the cornerstone and/ or the final aim of many research projects in the field [4] . Various considerations must be borne in mind, particularly in occupational dermatology: \u00ed Contact dermatitis entails both individual aspects (some workers suffer many interruptions to their normal activities over the course of a year due to contact dermatitis) and socioeconomic aspects. \u00ed The subject of prevention is usually divided into two sections: collective (or general) and individual protection measures [2] . There is a general principle: collective prevention and protection measures are usually more effective than individual measures, since the latter depend upon the personal will and constant application of each individual worker. Supervision and surveillance are crucial in this matter. \u00ed The development of occupational medicine has afforded a safer working environment in most industrialized countries than was common a few years ago. Occupational physicians are well aware of general issues such as avoidance (or reduction to an acceptable level) of toxic substances in the working environment, reduction of noise, vibration and/or stress. Nevertheless, they feel less confident when tackling skin problems and seek advice from a dermatologist trained in the management of such situations.",

A new glove material has been introduced, the 4-H glove (Safety 4 AS, Lyngby, Denmark), a laminate made of five layers of polyethylene-ethylenevinylalcohol copolymerpolyethylene (PE/EVOH/PE) -with a thickness of 0.065 mm, and this has been shown to inhibit the penetration of various acrylates [10] . Nevertheless, the 4-H glove does not have a sufficiently close anatomical fit for delicate tasks. It has therefore been suggested that a fingerpiece from the 4-H glove may be used under a disposable glove by dental personnel. Another possibility is to use the fingerpiece outside the disposable latex or vinyl glove [11] . In practice, when manipulations are of short duration, the use of a nitrile glove (N-Dex Best glove; Best Manufacturing, Menlo, Ga., USA) is quite convenient, despite the fact that such a glove can theoretically be penetrated by acrylics.",

This is especially true when dust particles are responsible for skin irritation [14] . An epidemic of slag dermatitis was reported [15] in a metallurgic plant where permanent mold casting techniques had been introduced. At one stage of production, workers poured slag (a mixture of silicium oxide and calcium oxide powders) into ingot molds. Dust, penetrating through protective clothes or between sleeves and gloves, accumulated in the flexures and on the extensor aspects of the thighs and arms. Subjective and objective skin symptoms were similar to those of fiberglass dermatitis. Scratch marks, papules and pustules were sometimes present. Microscopic examination of powder particles revealed that some were oblong and sharp-edged (length: \u00b110-80 \u00b5m). The dermatitis was considered to have arisen due to mechanical irritation of the skin by sharp-edged particles. We reviewed the problem and dispersed several samples of different slag particles in distilled water. The pH of the supernatant measured between 8 and 12. Slag dermatitis was therefore caused not only by the roughness of the particles, but also was also due to irritation by alkali. This large-scale occupational problem demanded effective measures and has been solved by complete automation. Among photographers, the problem of allergic contact dermatitis from color developers has been solved almost completely in Scandinavian countries with the widespread use of automated procedures [16, 17] . Nevertheless, some cases are still observed among technicians who use \"artistic\" (nonautomated) procedures. The drawback of automation is also related to maintenance and repair, during which workers may be caught off-guard.",

Cement causes dermatitis not only in areas directly exposed to the dust but also in areas covered with dust-impregnated clothing. Premixed cement delivered wet to the workplace eliminates the dust hazard to some extent. The addition of ferrous sulfate to cement immediately before mixing reduces the hexavalent chromium to the trivalent state and may thus prevent dermatitis. In some countries, ferrous sulfate is available in sacks to be added to cement (Melstar, marketed in the Netherlands). Its use is not always possible in practice for various reasons. Follow-up of workers, in order to evaluate the efficacy of such a preventive measure, has shown the value of adding ferrous sulfate, but it is nonetheless difficult to evaluate its precise impact, since automation has also played an important role in reducing the number of affected workers [19] . \u00ed Removal of chromate from household and/or industrial products is essential.

The presence of sodium dichromate in eau de Javel is no longer justified, either as a coloring agent or a stabilizer. The decision to remove sodium dichromate from eau de Javel by the French Trade Society of producers in Paris was a notable example of such an effort in preventive dermatology. In this case, one of the arguments in favor of removal was the fear raised by the medical authorities of provoking and/or perpetuating allergic contact dermatitis from chromate among users. It is interesting to note that this measure is not only important for preventing housewives' dermatitis but also for occupational dermatology, since eau de Javel is used on a large scale for cleaning or antiseptic purposes [21] . \u00ed Replacement of a biocide as an additive in many industrial products such as soluble oils.

Most of the cases occurred when Kathon CG was incorporated into \"leave-on\" formulations, at a concentration of 15 ppm. Removal of the biocide was necessary due to many complaints from consumers and dermatologists. It was decided to maintain Kathon CG as a biocide in \"rinse-off \" formulations, such as in shampoos, at a concentration of 7.5 ppm. Such shampoos are well tolerated by patients who had previously experienced allergic problems with \"leaveon\" preparations containing Kathon CG at 15 ppm. In this example, the risk analysis process for a microbiocide with broad applications as well as varied human exposure patterns involves assiduous planning, along with development and implementation of appropriate actions to monitor and reduce risk levels [22] .",

Since the course may be chronic, leading to disability, and since treatment is frequently of limited efficacy, prevention should be emphasized in order to reduce the incidence and prevalence of both irritant contact dermatitis (ICD) and allergic contact dermatitis (ACD). The incidence of ICD therefore closely correlates with exposure to skin-damaging materials and to wet work conditions [69] . Apart from total elimination of cutaneous contact with hazardous substances and the use of gloves or protective clothing, protective creams/gels (PC), or so-called \"barrier creams,\" are one of the classical means of protecting skin on the hands against low-grade hazards from the environment. The search for protective creams started in 1915, when a general practitioner from Wigan, England, Dr R. Prosser White, wrote that it was necessary that men's clothes and skin should be protected by overalls and suitable covering. Any cutaneous surfaces that were soiled were to be cleansed as soon as possible. To assist in this, it was advised that a bland, insoluble ointment was to be rubbed into the exposed surfaces prior to work. The quantity used was not to be large, but enough to block up the stomata of the skin [13] . In general, this concept is still true for the use of PCs at the workplace. However, we must bear in mind that skin protection products cannot offer the same level of protection as gloves. Preparations marketed as being an \"invisible glove\" may encourage workers at risk to be careless upon contact with irritants. On the other hand, they often remain the only practical preventative measure that can be used in occupations that require a good sense of touch, finger mobility, or when working at rotating machines.",

It is debatable as to whether a strict distinction between skin care products used before and after work is justified, since emollients alone have been shown to treat and prevent ICD [63] . Moreover, the benefit of an integrated skin protection based on different products has only rarely been validated [7] . However, it should be kept in mind that a strict and easily understandable separation into pre-exposure PCs, mild skin cleansers and post-exposure skin care products might be necessary to increase the acceptance and appreciation of skin care at the workplace. Most manufacturers offer special plans to pursue this aim. This chapter reviews essential work on the benefits of pre-exposure PCs. ",

            "text": "During recent years the prevailing opinion on PCs has been that they are effective in a purely physical way, since their composition enables a diffusion barrier against the offending irritant to be built up to prevent penetration. Hazardous substances with similar physico-chemical properties are grouped together (for example water-miscible or non-watermiscible) to simplify the process of choosing a product [13, 42] . In agreement with this common principle, water-in-oil (W/O) emulsions should provide benefit against hydrophilic and water-soluble irritants such as detergents, acids, alkalis, metal working fluids, and even plain water. Oil-in-water (O/W) emulsions are recommended against hydrophobic irritants such as oils, varnishes and organic solvents. However, the theory that the product builds up a physical barrier between the skin and the irritant, and that the formulation remains unchanged after the product has been applied to the skin, may be incorrect [21] . Additionally, in many workplaces skin contact with both water-miscible and non-watermiscible irritants is unavoidable, and a simple formulation may not prevent against both types of irritants. Moreover, it must be pointed out that the efficacy of a skin protection product cannot be judged theoretically on the basis of the formulation concept alone; it has to be examined individually in sufficient test models. Special investigations have been undertaken to develop preparations with dual modes of action, combining the different effect of hydrophilic ingredients such as propylene glycol, glycerol and sorbitol with those of lipophilic ingredients such as stearic acid and dimethylpolysilicane. However, a foamy skin protector (\"invisible glove\") that was claimed to form a two-dimensional network of crystalline stearic acid that was impermeable to hydrophilic agents failed a repetitive irritation test involving the anionic detergent sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS) and the solvent toluene (TOL) [20] . Other preparations are supposed to build up a firm second layer on the skin, which prevents penetration of various agents in a steric manner, including a fatty amine amide acetate that binds to negatively charged carboxyl groups of keratin, and a positive fatty ammonium ion that binds firmly to the negative charge of the epidermis [21] .",

In recent years, this model has been used in many laboratories as a routine procedure, as it is considered to be suitable for comparing results from the use of PCs simultaneously with a non-pretreated control site on the volunteers' back. However, manufacturers of skincare products prefer easy study protocols that provide valid data in a short time with few restrictions on the volunteers.

Using a set of various irritants modified in terms of their different concentrations and their application to volunteers' ventral forearms, it could be demonstrated that a one-week period was sufficient to evaluate the efficacy of PCs against most irritants, even if lower concentrations of irritants were used. Based on the RIT, a national multi-center study was subsequently designed to standardize a test procedure for the evaluation of skin protective products. A repeated short-time occlusive irritation test (ROIT) was evaluated in two parts (12 day and 5 day protocols) in four and six skilled centers, respectively. Using two irritants (SLS and TOL, each applied twice daily for 30 min twice a day for 30 min) and three different cream bases with different hydrophilicities, the evaluation showed that significant results could be readily achieved with the 5-day protocol.

Skin exposure in the occupational setting can be very complex. Hydrophilic and hydrophobic irritants such as the anionic surfactant SLS and the organic solvent TOL have mainly been used in studies, but repetitive contact to both hydrophilic and hydrophobic substances together or, more commonly, one after the other, occurs regularly in the workplace setting. For instance, workers in the metalworking industry are repeatedly exposed to water-based metal working fluids, neat oils, detergents and organic solvents. Therefore, interactions between irritant chemicals have significant practical consequences. Indeed, concurrent application of SLS and TOL was shown to induce significantly stronger reactions than those caused by twice daily application of each irritant on its own [85] . This additive effect of mixed irritant application impacts upon the use of PCs in practice and upon the way that PCs should be tested. In a recent study, the benefit from a commercially-available PC compared to non-pretreated control sites was tested against the sequential application of two irritants in the so-called tandem repeated irritation test (TRIT). A significant protective effect from the PC was obtained against treatment combinations SLS/SLS and SLS/TOL [87] . Interaction of further irritants should be investigated with attention to professions where a multitude of hazardous substances may cause ICD.",

            "text": "The cosmetic acceptance of PCs must be sufficient, because their use is often avoided in cases where a tight grip of tools and small objects is necessary. Additionally, PCs are not intended for use on diseased skin; only on mainly intact skin. They should be applied before contact with irritants, and reapplied after every break or after a certain period of time (half a work shift according to manufacturers' claims). Before the product is reapplied, the skin must be cleaned and dried properly to avoid increased penetration of any remaining irritants on the skin surface [42] . It is clear that the effectiveness of a PC is also influenced by the application itself. They must be applied not only frequently enough but also in adequate amounts and to all skin areas that need protection. In particular, the PC should be applied properly into the interdigital spaces. Studies with a fluorescentmarked PC have indicated that the application of PC was the worst for different professional groups and patients with hand eczema, especially in the dorsum of the hands and the interdigital spaces, excluding the space between the index finger and the thumb [79-81]. This method is now covered by many worker education programs and programs to evaluate product application and acceptance [3, 5] . A simple device with a fluorescent source (a Dermalux checkbox) can be used as a training tool in critical occupational working conditions to visualize and teach the proper use of a PC, giving direct feedback about the most commonly unprotected regions [39] . This experience, rather than anonymous instructive brochures given to the workers, can initiate changes in behavior [48, 81] .",

It has recently been suggested that, in analogy to the sun protection factor, a standardized testing method could be used to specify (irritant-specific) \"skin protection factors\" for each PC. Reasons for a lack of protection in practice are obviously inefficient products [20] , products that are effective against a special irritant but that aggravate reactions from to other irritants [83], or insufficient application of products on exposed skin areas [79] . Data from in vitro and in vivo tests underline the importance of careful selection of PCs for specific workplaces. Choosing the wrong preparation may well worsen the effect of an irritant. PCs are still not perfect. Much effort is needed to develop products that will give more protection and fewer side-effects. Efficacy and cosmetic acceptance are both important qualities of skin care products that provide protection in the workplace, but knowledge of how they are correctly used is critical. It goes without saying that their ability to prevent ICD and ACD must be evaluated in reliable studies. Results from animal experiments may not be valid for humans, particularly when dealing with irritants, in view of their complex action mechanisms and the high inter-individual variability of the susceptibility of human skin [91] . Considering the various models used to investigate the efficacy of skin care products, the validation of a sensitive, standardized and widely accepted model proved by interlaboratory standardization or controlled clinical studies in the workplace still seems to be necessary. Clearly, studies performed both under experimental conditions and in the workplace are needed before a rational recommendation about whether a product is safe and effective for skin protection can be made. Up to now, it has been largely unclear whether the various in vitro and Core Message in vivo methods used are suitable for simulating real workplace conditions, and whether these test results can be related to real occupational exposure. Further studies, especially under daily working conditions evaluating the contribution of each single element of the skincare program (products, frequency of application and education programme) are needed to produce evidence-based recommendations for skin protection [44] . However, repetitive studies in humanseven if they are experimental -are still the gold standard. Supplementary test methods can be used as screening tests but they must be compared to in vivo methods such as ROIT that are more closely linked to real life situations [40] .",

Additionally, prospective cohort studies and intervention studies [4, 16, 24, 38, 76] or randomized and controlled studies with the inclusion of a placebo [6, 55, 58] may contribute important knowledge when examining the relevance of the experimental data and evaluating the actual use of the skin protection product in a concrete situation. Both model investigations and cohort or intervention studies need proper statistical analysis and a sufficient number of volunteers in order to reach significant differences between intervention and control. Correct biometric methods should be applied [ Besides the use of products with proven efficacy, periodical training and motivation of individuals at risk is of utmost importance, because the best preventative measures have no effect when they are used irregularly and insufficiently. Special emphasis needs to be placed on educating the individual during apprenticeship. It is easier to train a preclinical student nurse in the correct use of protective products than to attempt to change their behavior after several years of work [48] . Up-to-date, informal academic presentations should be used to educate young people in professional training schools [59, 81] . In the end, general education and training of exposed workers in the use of PCs and preventative measures will have the most impact on the prevention of occupational contact dermatitis. With the words of Maria Montesori in mind, we ask people that say that education is too expensive: what is the cost of ignorance The first standardized test in humans with a set of four relevant irritants. In contrast to previously published procedures, the back (instead of the forearm) and a total of four irritants were used. Different formulations could be simultaneously compared to the control field, which received the irritant only, without pretreatment with PC. The irritants sodium lauryl sulfate, sodium hydroxide, lactic acid and undiluted toluene were applied occlusively for 30 min, over 2 weeks. The PCs tested were applied 30 min before contact with the irritants. Irritant cutaneous reactions were quantified by four parameters: erythema score, transepidermal water loss, blood flow volume and stratum corneum hydration by measuring capacitance. The main conclusion was that the accepted notion that oil-in-water emulsions against lipophilic irritants, and water-in-oil emulsions are primarily effective against hydrophilic irritants needs to be re-evaluated. These observations still hold true after many years. The interaction between the skin, the formulation and the irritant is complex and must be evaluated in humans. This was the first national multi-center study performed to establish a standardized test procedure for the evaluation of skin protective products. Based on the RIT, a repeated short-time occlusive irritation test (ROIT) was evaluated in six skilled centers. The skin reaction was induced by two irritants (sodium lauryl sulfate and toluene). The irritation was monitored by bioengineering means (transepidermal water loss measurement, colorimetry) and by clinical scoring. The evaluation showed that significant results could be achieved with a five-day protocol. Furthermore, despite the expected inter-center variations due to the heterogeneity of the individual thresholds of irritation, interpretation of clinical scores, and inter-instrumental variability, the ranking of the PCs in terms of reduction of the irritant reaction was consistent in all centers. It was of the utmost importance that the reproducibility of this test was demonstrated. By using a set of different bioengineering methods, three standard formulations were ranked in terms of their ability to prevent skin irritation caused by sodium lauryl sulfate. 3.

The PC was incompletely applied, especially on the dorsal aspects of the hands and in the interdigital spaces. Despite promising experimental data demonstrating the efficacy of protective creams (PC), their practical value is still viewed with scepticism. However, lack of protection could simply be caused by uneven or spotty application of these products. Individuals should be made aware of the most commonly missed regions in order to ensure complete skin protection. This simple method is a useful way to assess self-application and should be included in worker education. ",

The barrier effects of different generic materials vary. Each combination of chemical and protective glove material must be considered [27, 33] .

Penetration test methods for protective gloves and leakage testing for medical gloves have been described by Mellstr\u00f6m et al [26] . As a rule, leakage tests include a random sampling procedure where a certain number of gloves are filled with a specified volume of water or air. These are pass or fail tests, and the number of gloves allowed to fail per number of gloves tested is dependent upon the batch or lot size. The sampling procedure for inspection by attributes defined by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO 2859 should be used. There are several standardized leakage test methods designed for medical gloves that have been evaluated, and all test methods have inherent limitations [8] [9] [10] . In an overview, Schroeder et al [36] presented standard quality control testing and virus penetration. The standard tests used for glove integrity and virus penetration through used and intact gloves are discussed, as well as those used to test penetration through punctures in gloves. Tests used to evaluate the barrier integrity fall into two categories: Determination of resistance to penetration Part 3",

The use of different kinds of disinfectants is frequent for the preoperative skin disinfection of patients and in working situations where there is a risk of acquiring blood-borne infections. In these circumstances it is important to use gloves, both to protect the skin against infections and to avoid contact with disinfectants harmful to the skin. Some of these agents are known to cause allergic and/or irritant reactions after contact with the skin; for example ethanol, isopropyl alcohol, chlorocresol and glutaraldehyde. The influence of four disinfectant products on six different brands of medical gloves, evaluated by measuring the permeation and through SEM (Scanning Elec-tronic Microscopy) studies of the exposed glove material surfaces, has been described by Mellstr\u00f6m et al [24] . They found that gloves made from latex, PVC and polyethylene gave acceptable protection from contact with p-chloro-m-cresol (Blifacid) and glutaraldehyde (Cidex) containing products for at least 60 min, but did not provide acceptable protection from contact with isopropanol and ethanol. Recent studies also show that they provide inadequate protection from formaldehyde [17, 20, 21] .",

In order to minimize the risk of contact when preparing, dispensing and administrating these drugs, a standard procedure, appropriate technique together with personal protective equipment, e.g., gloves should be used.

This is a serious problem because there are currently no commercially available gloves that have the required dexterity but that also provide sufficient protection for the skin. Standard procedures, appropriate techniques, and packaging design together with adjusted personal protective gloves are urgently required. In several studies of the permeability of medical gloves to methacrylates in resinous dental material, no gloves were impervious, but nitrile and chloroprene showed a little more resistance than other glove materials [4, 17, 18, 28, 29] . However, it is important to note that the use of acetone as a solvent in a bonding material may reduce the protective effect markedly. The combined use of latex gloves with 4H/Silver Shield gloves as an inner glove may be useful in some working situations. The protective efficacies of seven different nonlatex gloves against a dental bonding product containing 2-HEMA were evaluated on eight patients with a test-verified contact allergy to 2-HEMA. Gloves made of neoprene gave the best protection, and gloves made of polyethylene gave comparable results to the positive control (no gloves) [2, 3] .",

However, despite the detailed knowledge available on their pathogenesis, diagnosis and therapy, they remain extraordinarily common, necessitating continual care for employees in \"wet work\" jobs, since they are a high-risk group for work-related skin disorders and allergies [24, 28, 32] . In this chapter we describe a range of interdisciplinary prevention strategies for work-related skin disorders, comprising both medical and educational measures. This integrative approach was developed using a framework of different projects investigating primary, secondary and tertiary prevention of occupational skin disorders. The theoretical basis for these projects was predominantly the World Health Organization's definition of health promotion [33] . In order to meet the requirements of the WHO for health promotion, including self-determination, autonomy, and the social responsibilities of the individual and the social environment, it is necessary to design preventive strategies concerning work-place conditions at an individual level [29, 20] . The efficacy of such measures is evaluated using the example of affected skin. In addition to adequate dermatological diagnosis and therapy for acute and chronic skin changes, the task of prevention also includes clarifying, for those at risk, the correlation between health risks and their own ability to act in order to protect themselves. This knowledge should then lead to individual empowerment [33] .",

During their vocational training, all of the participants were examined four times by a dermatologist. Their skin conditions were recorded using standardized scores [31] . Participants of the intervention group participated in six seminars (15 hours of lessons), held by professional educators. Therefore, these participants were specifically trained in skin care management and the prevention of occupational contact dermatitis. Moreover, they were supplied with the necessary skin care products, such as gloves and specific protective creams. Consultations about their work environments were also offered and given. Using written questionnaires, knowledge and attitudes concerning skin care management were checked in both the interventional group and the control group at the beginning and end of their second \"school year\". Statistically significant differences (p<0.05) in skin conditions were analyzed using the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test for grouped data. Statistically significant results gained from questionnaires on the attitudes, knowledge and behavior regarding skin care were analyzed using Mann-Whitney and Wilcoxon U-tests.",

An exploration of basic attitudes towards personal health and illness as well as towards the determinants of these attitudes (social environment, motivation, and so on) took place during the first consultation, which was recorded on a semi-standardized inter-view sheet. This was repeated in a modified form when each participant completed the project. Other measures included a theoretical and practical seminar on skin protection that went into the causes and forms of work-related skin disorders. This also elaborated on the skin protection measures that could be implemented. The material learned could be directly put into practice in a practical session. This meant that, for example, cutting hair whilst wearing gloves was practiced directly. All workers and barber-shop owners took part in work consultations carried out after the seminars. The causes of work-related skin disorders and ways to prevent them by applying adequate skin protection techniques were also discussed during the work consultations. A recap seminar was given for the participants at the end of the project. Difficulties encountered when putting the skin protection techniques learned into practice were discussed and solution strategies were worked out together [27] .

By investigating existing attitudes to the emergence of the skin disorder and the willingness to intervene autonomously in the course of the illness, it was possible to work out and successfully implement ways of motivating people to change attitudes and behavioral patterns. For example, the answers given to the question regarding the acceptance of slight skin changes as being an obligatory characteristic of the profession shed light on the significance of occupational socialization, which is partly based on old traditions [13] . The realization that we cannot expect the affected hairdressers to see a causal link between their illness and work-related skin disorders illustrates the need for theoretical material on the emergence of skin disorders in the hairdressing trade to be presented in the seminars. Explanatory and motivating strategies are two examples of such interventions [14, 21] . First of all, the teaching of theory in the seminars made it possible to achieve a positive effect by increasing knowledge about this illness. It is known from the training of patients, such as those with rheumatic diseases, that improved knowledge of the illness leads to an improvement in functional capacity. Similarly, positive therapeutic effects can be achieved by means of groups led by psychologists, supportive and clarifying conversations between patients and experts, as well as by means of an exchange of both experiences and emotional stress between the patients themselves [19] . Ehlers et al also point to the greater effectiveness of preventive measures when psychological approaches are included [6] . These remarks correspond to the results from the seminars Tertiary prevention (inpatient program) from 1994-1999 (n=352): 332 (65.9% \"Yes\") of the participants in the secondary prevention project for hairdressers still in their profession a year after hospitalization (23% \"No, due to OCD\", 8.1% \"No, due to other reasons\" and 1.1% \"No, for unknown reasons\") carried out in the above-mentioned project. It has been known for a long time that skin disorders, and in this case hand eczema in particular, are particularly stressful (on a psychosocial level) for those affected [25, 26, 29] . In some cases, each group of seminar participants became similar to a self-help group. The educational supervision, however, facilitates professional help, for example in relation to the categorization of everyday theories and lay ideas. This therefore corresponds to the requirement that any attempts by experts to intervene by preventing or rehabilitating illness should take the psychosocial level into consideration and so pay attention to the attitudes of so-called \"laymen\" to health and illness.",

This fraction is partly due to the fact that the evaluation is restricted to certain regions in Germany. The percentage of hairdressers with severe skin symptoms dropped from 49% at the start of the rehabilitation program to 11% after completion of the program. The proportion of hairdressers using gloves and applying skin care techniques doubled. The rehabilitation program therefore appears to be a successful way of helping hairdressers to cope with skin problems [22] .",

The majority of the participants had remained in their professions and practiced the advised skin care strategies.

Important preventive measures include exposure control, employee education and use of personal protective equipment such as gloves and moisturizers.

Employee education is an important preventive measure and should preferably result in increased knowledge about the function of the skin, awareness of symptoms due to occupational hazards and an understanding of managing hazards and the correct use of moisturizers and gloves. Organizational support is, however, also important, and written policies on work procedures should also be implemented at the workplace [3] . In the following, the experiences gained from some Danish intervention programs will be discussed. Two intervention studies were conducted with wet work employees: one in student auxiliary nurses (study I) [4] who were having their first apprentice period, and one study in wet work employees in nursing homes (study II) [5] . An intervention group and a matched control group were included in both studies, and the intervention group was exposed to an educational program including a skin protection program before or during the intervention period. The educational program provided information about normal and diseased skin, leading to increased awareness and early recognition of skin symptoms due to wet work. One of the prerequisites was for the participants to understand recommendations regarding wet work procedures (skin protection program). The skin protection program [6] was a series of practical instructions about skin protection that included updated evidence-based recommendations about wet work procedures and the use of protective measures (for ten actions that can help prevent hand eczema, refer to Chap 19) .",

This is supported by numerous previous findings [9] [10] [11] , and it highlights the fact that a history of atopic dermatitis and wet work are often noncompatible factors. Some studies have shown that skin irritation often occurs early in the professional career [12, 13] . The present study confirms this, indicating that clinical examination of the hands (pre-employment screening) may be advantageous for trainees. In study I, that included student auxiliary nurses, the clinical examination did not reveal any statistically significantly difference between the intervention group and the control group after the ten-week period of training. This was either a true negative finding or one related to the small number of participants included.A possible explanation is that the intervention strategy used in this study targeted at an individual level, so no organizational support was included. Bioengineering measuring methods for predicting skin susceptibility have been found to be useful in experimental studies, but their relevance in field studies is still debated. Some experimental studies have shown that high baseline TEWL may be a good predictor of skin susceptibility [14, 15] . Significant increases in TEWL in the exposed skins of the student auxiliary nurses were seen in the control group after 10 weeks of training, perhaps indicating subclinical skin irritation, but baseline TEWL failed to predict the development of skin symptoms.",

In study II, the intervention had a positive influence on wet work behavior, on knowledge, as well as on clinical skin problems, whereas study I failed to show any statistically significantly influence on the number of clinical skin problems. In study II, the focus was on prevention at both the individual and the organizational level. Both strategies are important, but intervention at an organizational level (\"policy making\") ensures that preventive measures are integrated as a part of the daily routine after the intervention period has stopped, ensuring a continuous learning process [18] .",
