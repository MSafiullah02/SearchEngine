Today, hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) is widely recognized as a distinctive clinical entity; it is associated with a precipitous cardiorespiratory decomposition, thrombocytopenia, and atypical lymphocytes on a peripheral blood smear and is transmitted by rodents throughout the Americas [2] . The deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus) and Sin Nombre virus were quickly identified as the primary reservoir and etiological agent of disease, respectively, in the originally recognized outbreak in the southwestern United States [3] and, subsequently, in most of North America.",

Their pioneering work led to a reclassification of hantaviruses into 2 distinct groups: (1) Old World hantaviruses, which are associated with renal syndrome, and (2) New World hantaviruses, which typically cause cardiopulmonary disease. The initial recognition in North America rapidly led to the description of numerous newly recognized viruses-in excess of 30 species-found throughout the Americas. New World hantaviruses are associated with a plethora of rodent host species in the sigmodontine subfamily, each with a unique rodent-virus species pairing. These viruses cause a spectrum of clinical illnesses designated as \"new hantavirusassociated American hemorrhagic fever\" and are thought to represent a coevolutionary relationship between New World rodents and their viruses [2, 3, 5, 6] .",

            "text": "Andes virus (ANDV)-associated HPS in Argentina and Chile has evidenced a unique predilection for limited person-toperson transmission. To date, there have been at least 6 reports supported by epidemiological and/or molecular data suggesting a potential for person-to-person transmission of ANDV [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] . The latest is the elegant study by Ferr\u00e9s et al. [14] presented in this issue of the Journal; it prospectively followed 421 household contacts of patients with laboratory-confirmed ANDV infection to test the hypothesis that ANDV retains the ability to be transmitted from person to person. The authors determined that sex partners of patients with laboratory-confirmed cases were at the greatest risk of infection, with an estimated secondary attack rate of 2.5% and detectable viremia 5-15 days before the onset of symptoms. The biological basis for person-to-person transmission of ANDV requires definitive characterization; however, ANDV is the only hantavirus that has been isolated from human serum and that consistently kills Syrian hamsters [15] . This evidence suggests that infection with ANDV results in a higher viral load [16] and perhaps that humans are a much more permissive host for this particular strain than for other hantaviruses. The data suggest that person-toperson transmission is the result of direct contact during the preclinical phase of infection (which is consistent with the timing of viremia) and that the disease is most likely to have an incubation period of 2-4 weeks and to occur after contact with subsequently severely ill patients. It also explains the paucity of nosocomial transmission, because contact with health care workers is likely to occur much later, during the clinical phase of infection.",
