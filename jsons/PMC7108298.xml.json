Identification of neutropenic episodes and the use of promptly administered empiric broad spectrum antibiotics has reduced mortality to below 5%.1 As a consequence, this patient group is under high antibiotic pressure and risks both the selection of and colonization by fungi and multi-resistant bacteria. Viral infections, especially respiratory viral pathogens, account for significant morbidity in children in general. It is therefore likely that an over-representation of viral infections is also present during febrile episodes in children with neutropenia. However, diagnostic and therapeutic options are scarce and have not motivated extensively investigation. Causative agents are only detected in 15\u201330% of the cases, and an etiological search of microbiological agents during febrile neutropenic episodes is required to strengthen the clinical management of this group of patients.2, 3\n",

They detected virus in 10% of oral washes and nasal swabs and noted severe infectious complications in these patients. Conversely, Koskenvuo et al.9 found evidence of viral infection in 44% of nasal swabs in children with leukemia with no significant association to neutropenia. In the present study we focused only on patients presenting with neutropenic fever and could confirm Koskenvuos9 high detection rate of respiratory tract viruses but also HRV as the most common detected pathogen. Differences in sampling procedures probably explain the discrepancy between the present study and the study by Christensen et al.8 Co-presence of a respiratory virus was detected in half of the episodes with bacteremia which also corresponds to what was found in a group of children with acute leukemia.10 Interestingly, no differences in the clinical picture and parameters were detected in our material except for longer hospitalization in the group of patients with bacteremia and co-presence of respiratory virus and bacteremia alone as compared to the groups with disseminated viral infection and with no microbial agent detected (Table 1). Whether this reflects a more severe clinical picture in group with co-detection of bacteremia and respiratory virus and bacteremia alone or a milder course in the group of patients with disseminated viral infection and no agent detected could not be ruled out in the study.",

            "text": "Utilizing PCR-techniques for viral detection has thus the advantage of increased sensitivity as compared to viral culture and antigen detection. It is however not clear whether the detected viral nucleic acid actually represents the direct causative agent of the neutropenic fever. A positive PCR result could also represent a sub-clinical infection, a post-infection viral shedding, or just intracellular non-replicating viral nucleic acid remnants. However, a recent prospective study on repeated sampling of infants showed that the same virus was detected in only 5% of consecutively sampled NPA after 2 weeks, and in these cases only rarely the same virus genotype.11 Prolonged viral shedding of RSV and influenza A has been reported in children with cancer.12, 13 Of 27 patients studied by Koskenvuo et al.9 whose follow-up samples were taken 1\u201311 days after the first one, 23 were negative whereas four patients remained virus-positive. In our present study, eight individuals had NPA sampled repeatedly during separate neutropenic fever episodes of which five demonstrated clearance. Whether the three patients remaining virus positive was due to a persistent infection or a new infection of a different genotype could not be ruled out since we did not perform sequencing. These patients were also sampled with a shorter interval and may have received stronger immunosuppression or represent a more severe underlying disease. However, as indicated by Koskenvuo et al.9 and our present study, the majority of viruses detected were eventually cleared, supporting the fact that the virus corresponds to an acute infection. In order to decrease the usage of broad spectrum antibiotics, the role of the detected viruses as causative agents needs to be further clarified in future studies by follow-up sampling but also inclusion of controls. It would also be helpful to study the meaning of different viral loads and their correlation to clinical disease.",

In this study, these viruses were present in 4% of the febrile episodes and are thus not a significant cause of morbidity in this setting. This is most likely due to a less profound immunosuppression in the majority of these children as compared to patients undergoing HSCT. In the case of erythrovirus infection, it may also reflect the need to analyze bone marrow-samples to find persistent infection where peripheral viremia is low or absent.14\n",
