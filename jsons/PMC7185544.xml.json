However, hRV and hMPV can also cause lower respiratory tract (LRT) symptoms such as severe bronchiolitis and pneumonia (Van den Hoogen et al., 2001, Falsey et al., 2002).",

Accurate diagnosis of hRV and hMPV requires molecular methods (Arruda et al., 1997, Van den Hoogen et al., 2001, Blomqvist et al., 2002, Boivin et al., 2002, Peret et al., 2002, Stockton et al., 2002, Vicente et al., 2003). Most of the PCRs described for detection of hMPV and hRV are designed to identify the virus with individual PCRs and are either time consuming as they require post PCR analysis or costly as they require two PCR reactions. One of the benefits of real-time PCR is that amplifications can be multiplexed as probes carrying different fluorophores enable differentiation of the amplified products. This also results in savings of time and money. To date no hMPV multiplex applications have been described.",

Infections with hRV were particularly present in the winter months, but also prevalent in summer in immunocompromised patients. Seven patients showed a co-infection with RSV, one with adenovirus and one with PIV1. In two immunocompromised patients, initially an infection with hRV was detected, and at a later time-point an infection with another respiratory virus, RSV and PIV3, respectively. In both cases hRV was detectable for over 4 weeks by the multiplex PCR. The clinical symptoms observed in the hRV positive patients are summarised in Table 3\n.

These viruses cause a significant number of acute respiratory viral infections in children and are found in more severe respiratory disease as well. The assay was proven to be sensitive with no negative effects by multiplexing. As different probes were used for the two viruses and the internal control, no post PCR analysis was required. The multiplex RT-PCR is specific for hMPV, but the primers and probe designed for hRV also amplify high input concentrations of some enterovirus subtypes with a weak signal. Differentiation between hRV and enteroviruses using hybridisation probes has been described (L\u00f6nnrot et al., 1999, Kares et al., 2004). Adding a specific EV PCR in the multiplex or sequencing the whole PCR product would solve the problem of differentiation. Unfortunately, no appropriate sequence suitable for real-time PCR and discriminating between hRV and enterovirus subtypes is available (Nijhuis et al., 2002). However, in clinical diagnosis the necessity of further discrimination of hRV and enteroviruses is questionable, as management and therapy issues are not affected by this identification.",
