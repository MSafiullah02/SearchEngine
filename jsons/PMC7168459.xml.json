In China, this species has been found in Anhui, Hainan, Fujian, Guangxi and Guizhou Provinces, among others (Zhang 1999). Field surveys indicate that these bats usually congregate in moist and dark places, such as caves or man\u2010made structures. Coronavirus has been isolated from this species (Poon et al. 2005), which has implications for human health in regions where humans may come into contact with bats. However, to date, very few studies have been carried out on this species, and so little is known about its population structure, genetic diversity, and migration and roosting habits. Development of appropriate molecular markers will greatly facilitate such research. Here, we describe 10 microsatellite loci that were isolated from M. magnater, in order to study population structure and genetic diversity of this species.",

Muscle biopsies were taken from five bats and preserved in 95% alcohol. Genomic DNA was extracted with the DNeasy Tissue Kit (QIAGEN). The enrichment method used to construct a partial genomic DNA library for isolating microsatellite loci of (AC) dinucleotide repeats was based on Kandpal et al. (1994) and Karp et al. (1998), with some additional modifications (Hua et al. 2006).",

The recovered polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products were denatured by incubation at 95 \u02daC for 5 min, and hybridized to a biotin\u2010labelled dinucleotide repeat (CA)15 probe (Sangon) in 0.5 m sodium phosphate and 0.5% sodium dodecyl sulphate (pH 7.4) for 16 h at 50 \u02daC. The hybridization mixture was incubated with VECTREX Avidin D (Vector Laboratories) in binding buffer (100 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.5) at 37 \u02daC and then washed four times with binding buffer at increasing temperatures to remove unbound fragments (37 \u02daC for 30 min, 50 \u02daC for 30 min, 65 \u02daC for 30 min, and finally 65 \u02daC for 30 min in 0.1\u00a5 binding buffer). Bound fragments were eluted with dH2O after incubating at 65 \u02daC for 30 min, and then recovered by PCR amplification as described above.

The PCR cycling was based on following conditions: initial denaturation at 95 \u02daC for 15 min followed by 35 cycles of 30 s at 94 \u02daC, 30 s at the relevant annealing temperature (Table 1) and 30 s at 72 \u02daC, with a final extension step of 20 min at 72 \u02daC. The PCR products were genotyped on an ABI 3730 sequencer (Applied Biosystems) and analysed with genescan 3.7 (Applied Biosystems) and genotyper 3.6 software (Applied Biosystems). Calculation of the expected and observed heterozygosities, and tests for both Hardy\u2013Weinberg equilibrium and linkage disequilibrium were performed with genepop version 3.4 software (Raymond & Rousset 1995).",

Observed and expected heterozygosity values ranged from 0.364 to 0.957, and from 0.676 to 0.951, respectively. After Bonferroni correction, four loci (CH37, CHB6, CH42 and CH85) showed significant heterozygote deficit (P < 0.005, k = 10). The presence of null alleles, stuttering and large allele dropout of the four loci was detected with micro\u2010checker version 2.2.3 software (van Oosterhout et al. 2004). None of them showed stuttering or large allele dropout, but all of the four loci showed the presence of null alleles (P < 0.05). No pairs of loci displayed linkage disequilibrium (adjusted \u03b1 = 0.00111, k = 45). We anticipate that the microsatellite markers reported here will be useful to evaluate genetic variability and the gene flow of M. magnater in the near future.",
