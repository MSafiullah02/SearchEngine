We performed a cell line susceptibility study with 28 cell lines. HCoV-EMC was found to infect the human respiratory tract ( polarized airway epithelium cell line Calu-3, embryonic fibroblast cell line HFL, and lung adenocarcinoma cell line A549), kidney (embryonic kidney cell line HEK), intestinal tract (colorectal adenocarcinoma cell line Caco-2), liver cells (hepatocellular carcinoma cell line Huh-7), and histiocytes (malignant histiocytoma cell line His-1), as evident by detection of high or increasing viral load in culture supernatants, detection of viral nucleoprotein expression by immunostaining, and/or detection of cytopathic effects. Although an infected human neuronal cell line (NT2) and infected monocyte and T lymphocyte cell lines (THP-1, U937, and H9) had increased viral loads, their relatively lower viral production corroborated with absent nucleoprotein expression and cytopathic effects. This range of human tissue tropism is broader than that for all other HCoVs, including SARS coronavirus, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-229E, and HCoV-NL63, which may explain the high mortality associated with this disease. A recent cell line susceptibility study showed that HCoV-EMC can infect primate, porcine, and bat cells and therefore may jump interspecies barriers. We found that HCoV-EMC can also infect civet lung fibroblast and rabbit kidney cell lines.

Following the SARS epidemic, 2 more HCoVs, HCoV-NL63 [11, 12] and HCoV-HKU1 [13] , were identified as causes of respiratory tract infections that were usually mild in clinical severity. On 23 September 2012, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported 2 cases of severe community-acquired pneumonia, which were subsequently confirmed to be caused by a novel HCoV, human betacoronavirus 2c EMC/2012 (HCoV-EMC) [14] [15] [16] . Phylogenetic analysis showed that HCoV-EMC was closely related to the bat CoVs Tylonycteris-bat-CoV-HKU4 (Ty-BatCoV-HKU4) and Pipistrellus-bat-CoV-HKU5 (Pi-BatCoV-HKU5), found in the lesser bamboo bat (Tylonycteris pachypus) and Japanese pipistrelle bat (Pipistrellus abramus), respectively, of Hong Kong, China [17] [18] [19] . As of 30 November 2012, the total number of laboratory-confirmed cases of HCoV-EMC infection reported to the WHO has increased to 9, with 5 deaths [20] . Because none of the 2400 residents in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia had serum antibody against HCoV-EMC [21] , a crude fatality rate of 56% is alarmingly similar to that of human influenza A(H5N1) pneumonia [22, 23] . The severe clinical manifestations of acute respiratory and renal failure and the high fatality fate were exceptional among all of the known HCoVs. Although these laboratory-confirmed cases were concentrated in the Middle East, with 5 cases in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and 2 cases each in Qatar and Jordan, research preparedness against another SARS-like epidemic is urgently needed, as deaths of exposed healthcare workers were suspected in Jordan [20] . Critical information on the pathogenesis of the unusual clinical severity of HCoV-EMC infection, the viral load and antigen expression patterns, and the likelihood of interspecies jumping of the virus from animals to humans must be ascertained to optimize laboratory testing protocols, treatment options, and infection control strategies.

The isolation of the first HCoVs, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, took many weeks and required the use of labor-intensive embryonic organ culture before subsequent adaptation to a limited number of cell lines. Even the more recently discovered HCoV-NL63 took 7-8 days before CPE was detected on tertiary monkey kidney cells [11, 12, 28] . HCoV-HKU1 produced significant viral load and antigen expression without CPE by 96 hours only in primary, well-differentiated polarized human airway epithelium cell line cultures generated by provision of an air-liquid interface for 4-6 weeks, but it still cannot be stably adapted to commonly used cell lines at this stage [29] . However, primary isolation of SARS-CoV was achieved by direct inoculation of patients' specimens into embryonic monkey kidney cell lines, ", "cite_spans": [{"start": 498, "end": 502, "text": "[11,", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 503, "end": 506, "text": "12,", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 507, "end": 510, "text": "28]", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 837, "end": 841, "text": "[29]", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "a N is defined as negative, 1 is defined as 1%-25% involvement, 2 is defined as >25% to 50% involvement, 3 is defined as >50% to 75% involvement, and 4 is defined as >75% involvement. b N is defined as negative, and numerals denote the percentage of positive cells. such as FRhK-4 or Vero E6, which produced CPE within 5-14 days. Moreover, SARS-CoV was able to grow in the polarized lung cancer cell line Calu-3 (2B4), human lung stem cells, hepatocytes, and intestinal cells after at least 3 days of infection [30] [31] [32] . This relatively rapid onset of CPE and the susceptibility of different tissue cells to SARS-CoV might explain the unusually severe clinical manifestations seen in SARS. This novel HCoV-EMC produced CPE on day 5 after inoculation during primary isolation and on subsequent passage by as early as day 1 in human Calu-3, Caco-2, Huh-7, and His-1 cells. Infected Calu-3 and Caco-2 cells showed frequent syncytia formation, in addition to cell rounding and detachment (Figure 2 ). In the Caco-2 cell line, approximately 10%-15% of cells showed syncytia formation 24-30 hours after infection. Additional incubation after the initial 24-30 hours resulted in cell detachment, with syncytia formation being less obvious. Although multinucleated giant cells could be found during autopsy of patients with SARS, syncytia formation was not found in SARS-CoVinfected cell cultures. None of the other HCoVs produced syncytia in cell lines. Furthermore, the ability of a virus to grow in cells from different host species might provide insight into its ability to cross interspecies barriers. We therefore performed a systematic study on the differential susceptibility to HCoV-EMC among 28 cell lines derived from different tissues, organs, and host species. Viral replication in different cell lines, as demonstrated by quantitative RT-PCR, may reflect the breadth of tissue tropism of HCoV-EMC. Seventeen of the 28 cell lines supported replication of HCoV-EMC. Notably, the mean viral load in monolayer cell lines did not change significantly after additional inoculation in serum-free medium supplemented with TPCKtreated trypsin. Although many betacoronaviruses, including SARS-CoV, have a proteolytic cleavage site between the globular head S1, for receptor binding, and the stalk S2, for membrane fusion, the corresponding cleavage site in HCoV-EMC could not be found on bioinformatics analysis. In terms of viral N protein expression and CPE, 7 of the 15 human cell lines and 5 of the 13 nonhuman cell lines had viral N protein expression detected by IF and/or CPE. Among the human cell lines, the infected lower airway cell lines (A549, Calu-3, and HFL) produced mean viral loads that were statistically significantly higher than those at the baseline, with more N protein expression detected by IF and/or CPE. Calu-3 cells, which are polarized with tight junctions, resemble the normal human pneumocytes more closely than A549 cells, owing to their greater secretion of MUC5 mucin [33] , showed greater susceptibility to HCoV-EMC than A549 cells. The upper airway cell line (Hep-2) did not support the growth of this novel virus. These findings are quite expected because all 9 laboratoryconfirmed cases of HCoV-EMC infection had severe acute pneumonia, but they are markedly different from those of the other non-SARS HCoVs, which have very limited cell line tropism and usually cause self-limiting upper respiratory tract infections, although fatal cases of pneumonia have been occasionally reported in patients with multiple underlying illnesses and in elderly individuals [34, 35] . In the case of HCoV-229E, it infected only hepatocytes, primary embryonic lung fibroblasts, neural cells, monocytes, dendritic cells, and macrophages after adaptation, not human pneumocyte cell lines [36] [37] [38] [39] . HCoV-OC43 infected only the human intestinal cell line HRT18 and neural tissue cell lines after adaptation, not human pneumocyte cell lines [40] . HCoV-NL63 could only infect the human intestinal cell line (Caco-2) after adaptation [28] . Even SARS-CoV could not infect human A549 cells or human embryonic lung fibroblasts but could selectively infect subclones of Calu-3 [32] and pulmonary stem cells [30, 31, 41] . Notably, HCoV-EMC induced CPE in susceptible human cell lines as early as day 1 in the intestinal and liver cell lines and on day 3 in the lower respiratory tract cell lines. These in vitro changes occurred even faster than those induced by SARS-CoV and could partly explain the apparently more severe clinical presentations and higher fatality rate in infections caused by HCoV-EMC. Specific testing for HCoV-EMC should therefore be performed preferably in lower instead of upper respiratory tract specimens from patients with unexplained severe pneumonia, as reported in the first case of HCoV-EMC infection. Although upper respiratory tract epithelial cells did not appear to support the growth of this novel virus, this finding did not preclude the collection of upper respiratory tract specimens from those with significant epidemiologic linkage and in whom lower respiratory tract specimens could not be obtained. More virologic data on HCoV-EMC-infected patients need to be collected before we know whether the current situation is similar to SARS, wherein virus was also shed in the upper respiratory tract, leading to human-to-human transmission [42] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 511, "end": 515, "text": "[30]", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 516, "end": 520, "text": "[31]", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 521, "end": 525, "text": "[32]", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 3004, "end": 3008, "text": "[33]", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 3599, "end": 3603, "text": "[34,", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 3604, "end": 3607, "text": "35]", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 3810, "end": 3814, "text": "[36]", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 3815, "end": 3819, "text": "[37]", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 3820, "end": 3824, "text": "[38]", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 3825, "end": 3829, "text": "[39]", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 3972, "end": 3976, "text": "[40]", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 4064, "end": 4068, "text": "[28]", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 4204, "end": 4208, "text": "[32]", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 4234, "end": 4238, "text": "[30,", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 4239, "end": 4242, "text": "31,", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 4243, "end": 4246, "text": "41]", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 5404, "end": 5408, "text": "[42]", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 991, "end": 1000, "text": "(Figure 2", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "Two clusters of laboratory-confirmed HCoV-EMC infections were reported, but human-to-human transmission could not be confirmed because these patients might have been exposed to the same animal or environmental source.

This clinical presentation corroborated with our laboratory finding of effective lytic infection of the HEK cell line and another human kidney cell line, 769P [43] . About 6.7% of patients with SARS developed acute renal impairment, which occurred a median duration of 20 days after the onset of symptoms [44] . Histologically, these patients had predominantly acute tubular necrosis with no evidence of glomerular pathology. The acute renal impairment was likely the combined effect of prerenal and renal factors instead of direct viral CPE. In kidneys of broiler chickens infected with avian nephropathogenic infectious bronchitis virus, lymphoplasmacytic interstitial nephritis with characteristic tubular epithelial degeneration and sloughing were found [45] . The histopathologic changes in kidneys of patients infected with HCoV-EMC should be determined. If viral cytopathic changes are dominant, it might explain the much higher incidence of acute renal failure among individuals with HCoV-EMC infection. The viral load in urine specimens from HCoV-EMC-infected patients should also be investigated, because acute renal failure was an important risk factor for mortality in patients with SARS and may also apply to patients with HCoV-EMC infection. Among the other human cell lines, Huh-7 and Caco-2 also showed significant lytic infection by HCoV-EMC. Interestingly, no hepatitis or enterocolitis has been reported in patients with HCoV-EMC infection so far. This is in contrast to SARS-CoV, which induced lytic infection in both the Huh-7 and Caco-2 cell lines and manifested clinically as hepatitis without liver failure in 49.4% of infected patients [46] and as watery diarrhea without enterocolitis in 48.6% [42] . However, detailed clinical information for most of the 9 cases of HCoV-EMC infection is lacking. Except for the first case, in which elevated levels of hepatic parenchymal enzymes were detected, the apparent absence of hepatitis and enterocolitis may be due to underreporting. Additional data obtained from animal experiments and human cases are needed to fully characterize the complete spectrum of disease manifestations of HCoV-EMC infection, and collection of extrapulmonary specimens such as feces, urine, and blood should be considered for specific viral testing to characterize the viral load and shedding patterns of the virus.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 92, "end": 96, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 258, "end": 262, "text": "[43]", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 404, "end": 408, "text": "[44]", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}, {"start": 857, "end": 861, "text": "[45]", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}, {"start": 1760, "end": 1764, "text": "[46]", "ref_id": "BIBREF47"}, {"start": 1819, "end": 1823, "text": "[42]", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "Marked proinflammatory cytokine production was associated with fatal SARS cases with acute respiratory distress syndrome and multiorgan failure. Although a significant increase in viral load in monocytic cell lines (THP-1 and U937) was noted, no N protein expression detected by IF or CPE was noted. A possible interpretation of this finding was that the inoculated virus was phagocytosed by the monocytes, remained in intracellular compartments without viral replication, and was subsequently released into the culture supernatant. On the other hand, the histiocytic cell line (His-1) had a substantially higher mean viral load of 10 9 -10 10 copies/mL, evidence of lytic infection with N protein expression detected by IF, and CPE. This cell line would be important for further studies involving in vitro cytokine induction by HCoV-EMC, because the other immune cell lines are either ineffectively infected with this virus or are associated with suboptimal cytokine production. This may help in defining roles other than viral cytolysis of cytokine dysregulation in the pathogenesis of HCoV-EMC.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "Our finding of HCoV-EMC's ability to infect primate and porcine cells concurs with another recent report, which demonstrated that cells of Rousettus, Rhinolophus, Pipistrellus, Myotis, and Carollia bats were also susceptible [43] . In addition, we showed that HCoV-EMC could infect cells from other animal species, including civets and rabbits. The virus' broad species tropism and its close phylogenic relatedness with the bat CoVs Ty-BatCoV-HKU4 and Pi-BatCoV-HKU5 [17, 47] support the hypothesis that HCoV-EMC has emerged from animal hosts. In fact, we have previously discovered numerous CoVs not only in bats but also in other mammalian and avian species [48] [49] [50] . The presence of a receptor that is used by the virus and common in bats, primates, pigs, civets, rabbits, and humans might imply a broad species tropism that is unique among all the currently known HCoVs [43] . The definitive and amplifying animal hosts of HCoV-EMC should be defined to prevent further interspecies jumping among animals and humans [19, 47] . In the case of SARS-CoV, the virus was traced from humans to civets as amplifying hosts and to Chinese horseshoe bats as a natural reservoir [47] . Further studies should provide more information on the potential of HCoV-EMC to cause a SARS-like epidemic in the future [14] .
