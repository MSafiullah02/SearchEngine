Within 2 d after contact-exposed poults were removed from the presence of PEMS-infected poults and returned to their respective treatment rooms to infect experimental poults, the experimental poults began to huddle together and show signs of the disease. When separated from the huddle, body temperatures of exposure poults were depressed significantly. Body temperatures decreased progressively through 8 d after exposure with a maximum depression of 2 C and returned to a normal level at 18 d after PEMS exposure. Similar decreasing patterns in serum glucose, inorganic phosphorus, triio-dothyronine, and thyroxine were observed, with maximum decreases in these serum constituents being found between 8 and 13 d after PEMS exposure. There were significant correlations among decreasing body temperatures, decreasing serum constituents, and mortality in the PEMS-exposed poults. Daily mortality rates associated with PEMS began at 6 d and peaked at 9 d after PEMS exposure. Mortality rates decreased from 9 to 15 d after experimental PEMS exposure. Depressions in serum constituents, body temperature, and increased mortality rates did not coincide with decreased feed intake associated with PEMS. Therefore, it was concluded that the agent(s) causing PEMS may have a direct effect on energy metabolism in afflicted poults.",

In a preliminary examination of PEMS-infected birds separated from these huddles, body temperatures (BT) of those birds were depressed. Hypothermia in both young and adult chickens has been associated with administration of some prostaglandins and bacterial endotoxins (Pittman et al., 1976) and with administration of Bordetella avium endotoxin to turkey poults (Edens et al., 1987) . Edens and Doerfler (1997) reported that glucose metabolism in PEMS-infected poults appeared to be impaired because hepatic glycogen was depleted along with a significant increase in hepatic glucose-6phosphatase activity without concomitant increases in serum glucose. These responses were not corrected with addition of sucrose to the drinking water of the infected poults (Edens and Doerfler, 1997) .",

The hypothyroidism-related diarrhea caused hypomotility characterized in the intestinal tract as a loss of rhythmic segmentation that is responsible for retardation of passage of intestinal contents. Hypothyroidism is also associated with decreased BT in birds (Freeman, 1970 (Freeman, , 1971 ) and could be related to the condition that prevails in PEMS.

This procedure minimized handling and also allowed poults to regain basal BT after being caught or after being removed from a huddle of poults experiencing PEMS. On a daily basis between 0900 and 1030 h using 10 poults per treatment, a 3-mm diameter vinyl-covered thermistor probe connected to a TUC model 46 telethermometer 4 with a response time of less than 30 s was inserted 3 cm through the cloaca into the large intestine of each poult. After 30 s, the BT was recorded from the analogue dial on the telethermometer (Edens et al., 1987) . Body weights were determined at placement and at 7, 14, and 21 d of age. At intervals of 2 or 3 d, depending upon the trial, beginning at 1 d of age, 10 poults per treatment were selected at random for blood sampling via cardiac puncture and were then killed by carbon dioxide asphyxiation. Serum was collected from individual samples using Vacutainer serum separation tubes, 5 and all serum samples were analyzed spectrophotometrically for glucose (Dubowski, 1962) and P i (Goldenberg and Fernandez, 1966) and by radioimmunoassay for thyroxine (T 4 ) and triiodothyronine (T 3 ) using commercial kits. 6 Mortality was observed and recorded twice daily, when necessary, in each of the eight trials represented here. During the first 7 d after hatch, mortality was corrected for normal poult mortality due to accidental deaths.",

The influence of feed intake during PEMS exposure has not been addressed fully, but such severely reduced feed intake should have serious consequences. Certainly, reduced feed intake (Barnes, 1997) should result in reduced heat production. May (1989) reported that T 4 acts as a prohormone, and under conditions of hypothyroidism, maximum conversion of T 4 to T 3 takes place via the action of action of 5\u00a2-deiodinase. There are factors that control conversion of T 4 to T 3 and these include the quantity and metabolizable energy content of feed (Klandorf and Harvey, 1985) . Examination of the T 3 :T 4 ratio indicated that PEMS infection had decreased the conversion of T 4 to T 3 , but this occurred without a concomitant increase in T 4 except at 2 d postexposure. This observation implied that feed consumption was low but had not ceased in the PEMS-infected poults. In chickens, feed deprivation for short periods of time causes a reduction in plasma T 3 and a concomitant increase in plasma T 4 (May, 1978 (May, , 1989 . Therefore, the decreased serum thyroid hormone concentrations in PEMS-afflicted poults would suggest a primary hypothyrosis due to damage in the thyroid gland. This hypothesis is also suggested by thyroid atrophy in PEMS-afflicted poults (H. J. Barnes and J. S. Guy, North Carolina State University, College of Veterinary Medicine, Raleigh, NC 27695) .",

Plasma T 3 in the B. avium-infected poults was not different from Control values, but there was an attenuated T 4 response to feed deprivation in the infected poults. Furthermore, significant elevations of plasma corticosterone and altered thyroid hormones in the B. avium-infected poults were thought to be contributing causes to decreased weight gain. Rudas et al. (1986) have also reported that chickens with malabsorption syndrome (runting/stunting syndrome) experience hypothyrosis. Within 2 d after exposure with intestinal homogenates that cause the malabsorption syndrome, liver 5\u00a2-deiodinase activity was depressed, causing a significant depression in serum T 3 concentrations. However, serum T 4 concentrations were also decreased significantly, and remained decreased from 6 through 29 d of age, ostensibly due to decreased nutrient absorption from the intestinal tract.",

(1997a) and Edens and Doerfler (1997) have provided evidence that part of the decreased weight gain is associated with decreased absorption of glucose and P i . The malabsorption appears to be related to damage in the intestinal epithelium on which the absorptive surfaces of microvilli of the epithelial cells are destroyed and to disruption of subcellular organelles such as the mitochondria and cell membranes associated with the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus. Therefore, the prolonged period of depressed weight gain after the passage of the acute mortality phase of the PEMS disease is due to a malabsorption condition. Malabsorption in PEMS-afflicted poults appeared to have been confirmed by the observation by Edens and Doerfler (1997) . Neither serum glucose nor serum P i were elevated by consumption of water supplemented with sucrose and potassium phosphate. Additionally, increased hepatic glucose-6-phosphatase activity and depletion of hepatic glycogen were observed in PEMS-afflicted poults given drinking water with and without sucrose + potassium phosphate supplements.",

            "text": "Even though decreased weight gain and greatly elevated feed conversion ratios in association with PEMS appears to be a sequel of malabsorption, the pathophysiological evidence suggests that the disease is rooted extra-intestinally. Specifically, the hypothyroid condition associated with PEMS can explain the decreased weight gain (Edens et al., 1991; Rudas et al., 1986; May, 1978) , and the hypothyroid condition can also explain the prolonged hypothermia associated with PEMS as heat production driven by T 3 (Freeman, 1970 (Freeman, , 1971 Bobek et al., 1980; Klandorf and Harvey, 1985; Klandorf et al., 1981; May et al., 1974; May, 1989 ) would be greatly decreased. Edens and Doerfler (1997) have also pointed out that hepatic cells in the PEMS-afflicted poult appear to be unable to utilize glucose for energy metabolism. However, utilization of structural protein from the musculature may also account for the decreased weight gain and wasting associated with such poults. The wasting of the musculature can be attributed partially to the enteroinvasive atypical E. coli that colonize all of the visceral organs of PEMS-afflicted poults (Edens et al., 1997a (Edens et al., ,b, 1998 . Additionally, there is an intense eosinophilia associated with PEMS induced with both Coronavirus-positive and Coronavirusnegative fecal inocula that cause the disease (Edens et al., 1997c) . It has been reported that eosinophilia is associated with immunodeficiency syndromes in mammals (Duic et al., 1970; Van Scoy et al., 1975; Bjorksten and Lundmark, 1976) in which there is impaired T cell functions. In PEMS-afflicted poults, there is immune system dysfunction characterized by a lower T cellmediated lymphoproliferative response (Qureshi et al., 1997) .",
