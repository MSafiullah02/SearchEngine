We analyzed data from population-based infectious disease surveillance for severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) among children <5 years of age in Kibera, a densely populated urban slum in Nairobi, Kenya. Methods: Surveillance was conducted among a monthly mean of 5,874 (range = 5,778-6,411) children <5 years old in two contiguous villages in Kibera. Participants had free access to the study clinic and their health events and utilization were noted during biweekly home visits.

Despite steady advances in characterizing principal etiologies, incidence, and factors contributing to severe respiratory infection [3, 4] , knowledge gaps persist [5] . Filling these gaps is critical to ensuring that limited available public health resources can be optimally targeted towards feasible, effective interventions. As has been the case for decades [6, 7] , pneumonia remains a major killer of children in Africa [8, 9] . In 2008, it was estimated that 35 million cases of pneumonia occur per year in children <5 years old in Africa [3] ; it was the cause of 18% of deaths among African children, resulting in >750,000 deaths [1] .",

Much has changed over the past two decades. The epidemiology of predisposing conditions for pneumonia, such as malaria, HIV and malnutrition, as well as socioeconomic status, is changing in Africa [12, 13] . Recent introductions of conjugate vaccines for the two leading bacterial causes of pneumonia, Haemophilus influenzae type B (Hib) and Streptococcus pneumoniae, into the Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI) in Africa will likely, by reducing the numbers of pneumonias that they cause, also lead to a shifted set of priority pathogens targeted for pneumonia prevention. In addition, new diagnostic technologies, including the advent of more readily available, highly sensitive molecular diagnostics, have enhanced the ability to detect respiratory pathogens [14, 15] . Finally, with massive urbanization in Africa and advent of densely populated informal settlements or slums [16] , different respiratory pathogen transmission patterns [17] , co-morbidities, and access to health care [18, 19] must be considered when comparing with sparsely populated rural areas from where most data on pneumonia epidemiology and etiology have been collected.",

All households in 2 villages, Gatwikera and Soweto West were offered enrollment. The mean surveillance population for children <5 years old was 5,874 (range = 5,778-6,411) children per month from 2007-2011. Enrollment was continuous since the project's beginning. The under-5 mortality rate was 15.1 per 1,000 person-years of observation from 2007-2010 [23] . HIV prevalence in the surveillance area is high (14.9% in adults \u226518 years in 2008) [24] . Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine was not yet introduced during this study period, and vaccine coverage rates for diphtheriapertussis-tetanus vaccine (as part of a pentavalent vaccine) were not available for the study area, but were felt to range between 60-80% during the study period.",

Rate ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated using Fisher's method (Computer Programs for Epidemiologists, PEPI, version 4.0x) for crude rates. The Delta method was used for calculating confidence intervals for the adjusted rates taking into account the variation in SARI case numbers, the variation in the adjustment due to clinic visitation, the variation in estimating the proportion of SARI with pathogen detected, and the variation in the pathogen attributable fraction (PAF) estimates (see below) [36] . We compared detection of each virus by qRT-PCR from swabs between cases and asymptomatic controls for the period of January 1, 2009, \u2212 Feb 28 2011. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals were calculated using unconditional logistic regression, adjusting for age group (0-11, 12-23, 24-59 months) and season when the swab was taken (December-February, hot and dry; March-May and September-November, the two rainy seasons; and June-August, cool). We used ORs to calculate PAF, which estimates the proportion of cases positive for each virus in which the virus is the likely cause [20, 37, 38] . The PAFs, calculated as (OR-1)/OR, were only calculated for viruses with ORs that were >1.0. For purposes of this analysis, we assumed the PAF was 1.0 for bacteria detected by blood culture based on the negligible probability of detection of pathogenic bacteria in blood of asymptomatic controls.",

To attempt to calculate PAFs adjusting for multiple pathogens (co-infections), we fit a logistic regression model including the pathogens, all pairwise interaction terms for the pathogens, and age and seasonality; the outcome variable for the model was case/control status (1 for case and 0 for control). The RSV and any parainfluenza interaction variable and the RSV and adenovirus interaction variable were borderline significant; all other pathogen interaction variables were non-significant. However, neither of these interaction variables was synergistic in SARI cases (one pathogen being more likely to be found when the other is present). The opposite was truethe second pathogen was less likely to be found in SARI cases when the other pathogen was present. Therefore, we simply present PAFs, adjusting only for age and seasonality.",

Since the odds ratios upon which the SARI etiologic fractions were based were significant only for RSV and influenza viruses, the etiologic fractions for the other three pathogens are point estimates (totalling 23.9%) and must be viewed with some caution; however, given an array of co-factors which contribute to the risk of pneumonia, it is conceivable that these pathogens are important in chains of causation.

A recent meta-analysis of published and unpublished data found that the incidence of RSV-associated severe ALRI has ranged from 10-18 per 1000 children/ year for infants and 3-9 per 1000 per children <5 years of age/year in Africa, with most data coming from passive, hospital-based surveillance with defined catchment areas [44] . These rates were much lower than those found in Alaska and among the Navajo and White Mountain Apache population in the US and in a site in Guatemala [44] ; it is unclear whether the differences are due to ecological variations or methodological differences. The rates from Kibera for RSV-associated SARI, resulting from active, community-based surveillance, which made it possible to account for cases missed during clinic surveillance, were slightly higher than the rates from the earlier African studies, but lower than the rates we found in the parallel rural study [20] . Our rural study clinic included in-patients, which increased the likelihood of including sicker patients, than in Kibera, where very sick patients may have chosen to go directly to hospital. The rates from both studies likely underestimate RSV (and other SARI) incidence because we only adjusted for that portion of patients who went to a clinic other than the study clinic; we did not adjust for under-utilization of any clinical services, which is a factor to consider in both the urban and rural sites [17, 18] . Over the past decade, the number of studies of influenza has accelerated in sub-Saharan Africa [45] ; data from 15 countries from 2006-2010, including Kenya (but not Kibera) showed that (without controls) 10% of SARI cases <5 years old had evidence of influenza infection [46] , which was similar to what we observed in Kibera. A meta-analysis of published and unpublished global data, including 2008 data from the Kibera site (among many others), found a rate of influenza associated ALRI of 14/1000 children <5 years old in developing countries [47] , imputing that 111,500 deaths due to influenza (range = 21,000-245,000) occurred in 2008. As documented in other tropical environments [48] , influenza in Kibera appeared to be a year-round phenomenon without a predominant occurrence in cool months.",

The 3 viruses are likely important pathogens to consider when developing technologies and packaging strategies to prevent severe acute respiratory illness. However, it should be noted that because of frequent adenovirus infection in early childhood and persistent shedding, many detections of adenovirus by rRT-PCR could represent prevalent rather than incident infections [54] .",

No sensitive tests for S. pneumoniae and other bacterial pathogens are currently available. However, historical data and vaccine probe studies [56] have shown that a substantial proportion (10-20%) of SARI was likely due to pneumococcal infection; thus, the rate we found (shown in Table 3 ) substantially underestimates the rate of S. pneumoniaeassociated SARI. Since Hib vaccine is given routinely in Kenya, Hib was likely not an important contributor to SARI incidence. We detected NTS and Salmonella Typhi in blood culture from only a few patients. However, given the importance of NTS and S. Typhi as causes of acute febrile illness often with respiratory symptoms, in some settings [39, 57] , it is worthwhile to be aware of their potential role. The impact of these pathogens may change, especially with urbanization and growth in slums, which especially appears to increase the risk for typhoid fever [39] . The data from this study are consistent with a study from South Africa suggesting that S. aureus may be an important cause of pneumonia in children [58] ; in that study, there was a potential link to HIV infection. In an urban setting in Nigeria, S. aureus was the most common cause of bacteremia in children with pneumonia [59] . More data are needed to characterize the burden, co-morbidities and other risk factors for children with S. aureus bacteremiaassociated SARI, recognizing the potential that some of the microbiological results may represent contamination.",

If one assumes, based on pneumococcal vaccine probe data [56, 60] that approximately 25% of SARI (based on a 12% reduction in severe pneumonia and a 50% vaccine efficacy against all pneumococcal serotypes from vaccine studies) is due to S. pneumoniae, then up to 75% of SARI episodes might be attributable to a specific etiologic agent. Thus, we could not attribute illness to a specific pathogen in at least 25% of cases. The most likely explanation for this diagnostic gap is insensitivity of diagnostic tests and type of specimens-nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs are not the most efficient techniques for capturing all respiratory viruses [61] and are not appropriate for detecting key bacterial etiologies of pneumonia. Timing of specimen collection vis-\u00e0-vis peaks in virologic shedding may also have played role. It is also likely that pathogens other than the ones we tested for (possibly including pathogens not yet known) caused a proportion of these illnesses, and will become important public health targets in the future as new diagnostic tests become available and, also, potentially as new pathogens are recognized. In addition, clinical syndromes, like malaria, can masquerade as pneumonia, thus accounting for a proportion of the \"non-attributable causes.\"",

This restricted the precision of our estimates of pathogen attributable fraction; consequently, we could not confirm the precise role of several pathogens that may be important contributors to the burden of SARI. In addition, quantifying the viral load in respiratory secretions (which we did not do in this analysis) could potentially identify a threshold of pathogen load associated with illness versus asymptomatic colonization [62, 63] . Also, we did not test for other pathogens that might contribute to the incidence of SARI, like human coronaviruses, bocaviruses, and others [64] [65] [66] . The subset of children with SARI who were swabbed were more likely to have several indicators of more severe illness (like chest indrawing) than children with SARI who were not swabbed, although low oxygen saturation was more often observed in children who were not swabbed. Thus, incidence rates of pathogens which are linked to specific clinical presentations may have been overestimated. For calculating pathogenspecific incidence rates of SARI, we used one adjustment factor, based on the proportion of all clinic visits for SARI that were to the study clinic, because there was no available approach to make this adjustment by etiology; however, in reality, study clinic visitation patterns may not have been consistent across etiologies, since some may be associated with symptoms more likely to induce a visit to the study clinic, rather than other clinics in the area. Finally, since our case definitions for SARI did not include apnea, which can be a severe manifestation of RSV-associated bronchiolitis in neonates, we likely underestimated the role of RSV in young infants. Furthermore, the active case detection, and enhancements within the community to encourage early treatment, may have reduced mortality from SARI, and also reduced detection of more severe forms of the syndrome, probably led to underestimations of incidence, especially for pathogens most likely to result in greater clinical severity of illness; thus, our findings may not be representative of SARI cases studied elsewhere.",
