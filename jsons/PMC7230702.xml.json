            "text": "Seaweeds have traditionally been consumed by people inhabiting coastal areas in East Asia. Seaweed is rich in vitamins and minerals and is known to have many favorable effects on human health. There are three groups of seaweed, namely green algae, red algae, and brown algae. Green algae contain large amounts of chlorophyll, or green pigments such as those found in terrestrial plants. In contrast, red algae contain, in addition to chlorophyll, plenty of red pigments called phycoerythrin and blue pigments called phycocyanin, giving them a red or purple color [1,2]. Brown algae contain, in addition to chlorophyll, red\u2013brown pigments called fucoxanthin and take on a yellowish brown or blackish brown color. The green alga Monostroma nitidum is often confused with a species of sea lettuces (Ulva Linnaeus). However, M. nitidum and sea lettuce belong to a different order in biological classification. Many species in the group of sea lettuces have a double layer of cells, whereas M. nitidum have a single layer of cell assemblies (Figure 1a,b) [3]. The Japanese name of M. nitidum Hitoegusa is derived from the fact that the leaf-like tissue is composed of a single layer of cells. M. nitidum thallus consists of many cell aggregates (Figure 1c), separated with mucilage rich in dietary fiber, vitamins, minerals, lipids, and peptides [3].",

However, shortly after their commercialization, these antiviral medications were met with the emergence of drug-resistant viruses, posing a major challenge. It is known that, because these antiviral agents specifically inhibit enzymes of the viruses, they are more likely to induce mutations in the viral DNA or RNA. To overcome this problem, researchers sought to identify and analyze novel substances with antiviral properties that are extracted from naturally derived substances. RS was the outcome of one of those studies [9].",

Accordingly, to clarify whether the extracted RS, a soluble fiber, is effective for treating obesity and obesity-related diseases, including hepatic steatosis, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia, the zebrafish was used to assess and examine its effects. The zebrafish is a model organism that has been used in recent years to identify and assess drug candidate agents for vertebrates. When zebrafish were rendered obese after being fed a high-fat diet, they doubled their weight compared to normal feeding in four weeks. When switching to a diet containing RS, the weight gain of these obese zebrafish was significantly attenuated [25]. RS also significantly (p < 0.05) mitigated the elevation of serum LDL cholesterol induced by a high-fat diet and prevented fat accumulation in the liver. The gene expression analysis showed that RS mainly inhibits lipogenesis. These results suggest that RS has anti-obesity effects. We conducted a clinical trial on 16 adult males with high cholesterol levels [24]. Their serum cholesterol levels were determined after the study subjects took RS every day for six weeks. As a result, there was no change in serum HDL cholesterol level, but LDL cholesterol level in the RS-treated group was significantly (p < 0.05) reduced compared with that of the group not taking RS. These results suggest that RS keeps the LDL/HDL cholesterol ratio low and prevents lifestyle-related diseases such as obesity and hyperlipidemia. ",

For example, bacterial-membrane-derived lipopolysaccharides (LPS) cause acute damage to endothelial cells and body tissue cells [39]. Different from PAMPs, a group of cell-derived molecules (damage-associated molecular patterns: DAMPs for short) that are released in association with cell death or injury may lead to the production of inflammatory cytokines and molecules associated with the innate immune system [37,38]. For example, DNA and histone that are leaked out from injured or disrupted cells significantly induce inflammation in the endothelial cells, leading to the production of a large quantity of TF, VWF, and TNF-\u03b1 [40]. This, in turn, accelerates blood coagulation and platelet aggregation, leading to the formation of microthrombi in the capillary of various organs and the induction of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) [41], which may result in multiple-organ failure (MOF) [42] or severe bleeding. Moreover, hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) caused by Escherichia coli O-157 infection [43], sinusoidal obstructive syndrome (SOS)/veno-occlusive disease (VOD) [44,45], and transplantation-associated thrombotic microangiopathy (TA-TMA) [46] are all disorders or conditions that result from endothelial damage and are therefore symptoms of endothelial damage. To prevent the onset of these diseases, it is quite important to prevent the inflammation of the endothelium. ",

To examine the effect of RS on blood coagulation, human blood plasma was used to examine the effect of RS on the prothrombin time (PT), which measures extrinsic coagulation ability, and on the activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), which measures intrinsic coagulation ability. Heparin was used to compare the difference with RS. Heparin is one form of sulfated polysaccharides, and it has been used as an anticoagulant from old times [49]. As shown in Figure 7a,b, RS prolonged both the PT and APTT in a concentration-dependent manner. This result shows that RS plays an inhibitory role in the extrinsic, as well as in the intrinsic, coagulation system [14]. However, the anticoagulation effect of RS was comparable to that of heparin at RS concentrations of approximately 10-fold the concentration of the latter. Thus, it can be inferred that the coagulation inhibitory effect of RS is about one-tenth that of heparin. It has been reported that intraperitoneally administered RS suppressed the PT and APTT in in vivo experiments using rats [16,17]. Therefore, RS is thought to be effective in preventing the development of venous thrombosis.",

The minimal structure of the AT binding site in heparin has been shown to be GlcNAc-GlcA-GlcN-IdoA-GlcN [53]. However, RS does not have a structure like the AT binding site of heparin. Therefore, the binding strength between RS and AT could be about 1/10 that of heparin. ",

To identify the differences between RS and heparin in their effects on inflammation of endothelial cells, we examined whether RS regulates the expression of TF, a trigger of blood coagulation and inflammation, and the platelet aggregating factor VWF in bacteriogenic LPS-induced inflammation of endothelial cells. As shown in Figure 9a, adding LPS induced a marked elevation in TF expression in the endothelial cells, while the TF expression was significantly (p < 0.01) suppressed in the presence of RS in an RS-concentration-dependent manner [14]. Moreover, RS itself significantly suppressed (p < 0.01) the TF expression in endothelial cells not stimulated with LPS in a dose-dependent manner. Similarly, as shown in Figure 9b, LPS significantly induced the expression of VWF in the endothelial cells, and the VWF expression was significantly (p < 0.01) suppressed in the presence of RS in a concentration-dependent manner [14]. Moreover, RS significantly suppressed (p < 0.01) the VWF expression in the endothelial cells not stimulated with LPS in a dose-dependent manner. The effect of heparin was analyzed under the same conditions, and the results showed that, although heparin did not affect the TF expression in the endothelial cells stimulated with LPS, it significantly suppressed (p < 0.01) the TF expression in the endothelial cells not stimulated with LPS (Figure 9c). Unlike RS, heparin enhanced VWF expression in the endothelial cells both in the presence and absence of LPS (Figure 9d). Likewise, RS suppressed significantly the elevation of TF and VWF expression in TNF-\u03b1- or thrombin-induced inflammation of endothelial cells, whereas heparin did not show such a suppressing effect (data not shown here) [14]. Overall, unlike heparin, RS was shown to strongly attenuate inflammatory injury in cultured vascular endothelial cells. RS is suggested to be a novel anticoagulant and anti-inflammatory substance for vascular endothelial cells. ",

As a polymer with a molecular weight of more than 30,000, RS transportation into the blood via oral ingestion has traditionally been considered difficult. Previous studies on fucoidan, a polymeric sulfate polysaccharide similar to RS, may be helpful for elucidating the in vivo absorption of RS. Fucoidan is a dietary fiber that is abundant in viscous matter of brown algae, such as kelp, seaweed, and mozuku (Nemacystus decipiens). It is mainly a sulfated polysaccharide composed of tens to hundreds of thousands of L-fucose, and its average molecular weight is about 200,000. In a clinical study of fucoidan, about 50 ng/mL of fucoidan was detected in the blood six hours after the single oral administration of the agent [56], demonstrating that fucoidan, despite its small quantity, was absorbed from the intestine and transported to the blood. Although fucoidan and RS are composed of different sugars, their chemical structures are similar, so it is assumed that RS enters the blood in a similar manner. Terasawa et al. showed that FITC-labeled RS colocalized with Peyer\u2019s patch M cells 30 min after oral administration of the RS, indicating that RS could bind to the M cells and become incorporated into Peyer\u2019s patches [13]. Microfold cells (M cells) are a part of the intestinal epithelium that is involved in the selective uptake of antigens, such as polymers and bacteria, from the gut lumen into Peyer\u2019s patches, an intestinal lymphoid tissue [57,58,59]. Thus, it is quite possible that orally ingested RS is transported from the gut lumen into the blood via M cells in Peyer\u2019s patches, where it carries out various biological activities.",
