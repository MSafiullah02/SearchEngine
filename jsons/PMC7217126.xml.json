In general, patients with good prognoses for recovery have priority over patients with poor prognoses.\u201d In contrast, the American Thoracic Society recommended that \u201cwhen demand for ICU beds exceeds supply, medically appropriate patients should be admitted on a first-come, first-served basis\u201d (6).",

Interestingly, in an attempt to develop a survival cutoff for triage decisions, only 77% of respondents agreed to a survival cutoff of 0.1% (7). This may be related to intensivists attempting to rescue with an ICU trial even patients with little chance of surviving knowing that they can later discharge the patient or limit treatments (7). Recent statements on ICU triage also recommended that patients be admitted based on their potential for benefit (8\u201310). Most statements declared that triage criteria should be explicit, fair, disclosed in advance and not be based on race, ethnicity, sex, sexual preference, financial status, or social worth (5\u201310). Unfortunately, current triage tools using objective prioritization, diagnosis, or parameter models are unable to provide ICU admission and exclusion criteria with demonstrated improved outcomes (8). Although attempts have been made to develop objective, triage scores (11), none are currently being used. Some triage scoring tools have been specifically developed for use in epidemics; however, none have been validated in a crisis setting (12\u201317).",

As only a few patients are admitted to an ICU every day and beds are either available for incoming patients or can be made available by discharging patients, the \u201cfirst come, first served\u201d criteria can usually be used for one patient after another. Unfortunately, there are occasions where more than one patient is vying for the last ICU bed. How should the \u201cfirst patient\u201d be defined when determining \u201cfirst come, first served\u201d criteria? Is it the first patient admitted to the emergency department, the first patient that the triage officer heard about, the patient in the operating room for whom an ICU bed was reserved, or the first patient that the triage physician accepted? In addition, if there is more than one ICU admission candidate how should \u201cmedical benefit\u201d be defined? Is it saving the most lives or saving the most life-years with ICU care for potential patients or the incremental medical benefit between ICU care versus ward care in these patients (10)? If the latter, how much larger must the difference in benefit be? The South African consensus guideline recommended a benefit difference of 15\u201325% (10). Although intensivists prognosticate more accurately than scoring systems (18), uncertainty remains and physicians\u2019 accuracy lacks the consistency and precision patient desire.",

Triage data from some ICUs affected by the COVID-19 pandemic are shown in Table 1. ICU beds and daily census increased approximately double from the previous year. It is too early to evaluate mortality which should be relevant at 28 days after admission. Recent reports of moderately high population mortality from COVID-19 in China (61.5%) (25) and high ICU mortality in the United States (67%) (26) are worrisome. It has been suggested that the high mortality maybe related to the large bed expansion without adequate healthcare resources (27). This has implications for expansions that are currently occurring worldwide. Experience from severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) showed that rapid and excessive expansion may overwhelm staff leading to excess infections in healthcare workers and compromising care (28). Thus expansion should be matched by safe staffing to guarantee an appropriate quality of care and staff safety which necessarily limits expansion. A consensus group with first-hand experience of outbreak expansion during SARS concluded that safe expansion is realistically limited by availability of acceptably trained staff and limited to a maximum expansion of 50\u2013100% of baseline capacity (29). Hospitals must also balance ICU needs and the potential decreasing benefits of increasing ICU capacity due to excess workload with other hospital needs (20).",

Whether this is feasible will depend on the country and magnitude of the crisis. Many intensivists believe that only a senior physician with triage experience can make these decisions and be part of such a committee. Are there enough intensivists to provide care and be part of a triage committee? Can other physicians along with other professionals without triage experience triage patients in a pandemic? If an institution creates a committee, it could include doctors (expertise in administration or palliative care maybe particularly helpful), nurses, social workers, and ethicists. Decisions should be made by senior physicians with triage experience. As intensivists who have become invested in the care of a patient over time may have difficulties withdrawing ventilation (32) or discharging patients to wards under these difficult conditions, the institutional triage or ethics committee could be helpful in affirming and endorsing the decision taken by a senior intensivist or making the decisions themselves. Admission, discharge or limitation decisions must be communicated to the patient or family. The public prefers that triage be performed by senior doctors and that predetermined criteria be used (36). If patient surge exceeds the number of available critical care trained specialists, intensivists should supervise nonintensivist physicians (20).",

Reevaluations for admitted and refused patients should be performed when appropriate and feasible ideally every 24 hours. As COVID-19 patients tend to have longer ICU durations (25) reassessments for remaining in the ICU should occur later, at days 10\u201314. When faced with overwhelming resource restrictions, it may be justified to limit life support therapy or discharge a patient with very poor survival prognosis after admission to ICU to allow queuing patients with a much higher probability of benefit to be admitted. This process will be difficult to implement, and we recommend that such decisions which are not as time critical be made by broad consensus. A decision by more than one senior ICU clinician, an independent physician and possibly the triage committee could serve to enhance fairness, consistency and mitigate the moral distress associated with such decisions.",

Most importantly prospectively defined criteria and protocols should be announced in advance, be explicit, fair and just without biases, and provide maximize consistency in decision-making. Changes may be required in the triage tool and other recommendations as more knowledge about COVID-19 develops. Although intensivists make difficult decisions daily, they pale with the triage decisions currently being made with the COVID-19 pandemic. Courage lies not in making gut-wrenching, triage decisions but living with them. Failing to make and implement necessary triage is certainly worse than making a poor choice.

It is not considered, however, a complete substitute for the carefully considered judgment of an experienced intensive care clinician. The presented algorithm is an example and each institution can decide on which performance score, comorbidities, and organ system failures to use based on their experience and what their staff ifs most comfortable using. A triage (prioritization) decision is a complex clinical decision made when ICU beds are limited. A structured decision-making process is important to maximize transparency and improve consistency in decision-making. A clinical estimation of likely benefit (outcomes from ICU admission compared with outcomes expected if the patient remained on the ward/other care area) is necessary so that patients who will benefit most from ICU are given priority. Examples of clinical conditions that the expert group believe would likely result in a failure of a patient to meet sufficient priority for admission is provided (priority 4). This conceptual algorithm outlines a recommended process for making an individual triage decision, based on a likelihood that survival without ICU care would be low (5\u201310% or less), and if admission criteria as laid out are met, survival would be estimated to be in excess of 50% short- to medium-term survival. The initial exclusion criteria are based on exclusion criteria used under \u201cnormal\u201d conditions so that the same patients are eligible during pandemic conditions and given priority based on their likelihood to benefit. Then patients must meet one of the inclusion criteria. Priorities are then based on those to be \u201cconsidered first\u201d (priority 1 and then priority 2) and \u201cconsidered last\u201d (priority 3 and then priority 4) with priority ranking from priority 1 to 4. These exclusions should help foster trust in a fairer triage system with less chance of discrimination. Each decision is assisted on the basis of an agreed criterion thresholds for the particular ICU at a specific time and will be dependent on available resources and the number of patients queuing for admission (e.g., stricter thresholds may be required during the peak of the pandemic, and less strict thresholds at the beginning and toward the end). The performance scores, comorbidities, and organ system failure variables chosen for this example are those that are the quickest to assess. Performance scores: The premorbid baseline condition can be assessed using the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Score, the Clinical Frailty Score, the Karnofsky Performance Scale, or other functional impairment tool the user is accustomed. Comorbidities can be assessed using the ASA score, number, or severity of comorbidities. Organ system failures can be assessed using the number of organ system failures or Sequential Organ Failure Assessment. Reevaluations for admitted and refused patients should be performed ideally every 24 hr. At reassessment of patients at days 10\u201314 or if significant deterioration or lack of improvement in the patient\u2019s condition occurs decreasing the patient\u2019s predicted survival to below the current priority group receiving critical care, reallocation of ventilator/ICU bed (following review by triage committee) should be considered. Status/post (S/P) cardiac arrest refers to patients with a recent cardiac arrest or one leading to significant anoxic brain damage.",
