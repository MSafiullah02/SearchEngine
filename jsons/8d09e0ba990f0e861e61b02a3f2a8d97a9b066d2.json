Separation from loved ones, loss of freedom, uncertainty over disease status, and boredom can, on occasion, create dramatic effects. Incidents of suicide in these cases have been reported (Brooks et al., 2020) .",

As part of mental support in their daily patient care, we conducted one-on-one semi-structured individual interviews with inpatients with SARS-CoV-2 1 to 2 days before discharge. Each interview lasted approximately 20 minutes. The interviews were recorded in the patients' notes. Each patient's background (age, sex, nationality, length of hospital stay), psychiatric burdens or stress during hospitalization, and concerns after discharge were reviewed. This study was reviewed and approved by the Ethics Committee of the Center Hospital of the National Center for Global Health and Medicine after compliance with the condition that a document that declares an opt-out policy by which any possible patient and/or relatives could refuse to be included in this study was uploaded on the Web page of the Center Hospital of the National Center for Global Health and Medicine.",

Meanwhile, some inpatients had discrimination, prejudice, and suspension and dismissal from work. This factor is relevant because it increases the risk of long-term social isolation after discharge and may increase the risk of suicide (Barbisch et al., 2015) . Appropriate mental support for patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection after discharge as well as during hospitalization is necessary. In addition, further studies to explore human-to-human transmission and treatment options are needed to prevent further outbreaks and to reduce patients' fear of transmitting the virus to their loved ones.",

One of them was identified as a SARS-CoV-2-infected patient by his colleagues. Disclosure of information to the media and the handling of personal information in case reports must be closely looked into. Fear of being socially marginalized and stigmatized may cause vulnerable patients to deny early clinical symptoms and may contribute to their failure to seek timely medical care, resulting in another cluster (Person et al., 2004) . Also, this fear aggravates the abovementioned sense of isolation, and may also increase the risk of suicide (Barbisch et al., 2015) .",

Thus, the sample size was small, and information might not be saturated. Second, a total of twelve patients with SARS-CoV-2 were discharged during the study period. However, four patients did not have mental support as part of their daily patient care. Thus, the opinions of the eight patients interviewed might be biased. Finally, cultural differences might limit the universal applicability of our findings. Whether or not the findings of this study can be applied to patients of other ethnicities remains unknown.",
