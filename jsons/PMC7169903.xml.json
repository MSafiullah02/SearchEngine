The transmission-based precautions include contact, droplet, and airborne precautions.[2] In theory, SARS-CoV-2 could be transmitted via a bloodborne pathway but additional precautions are not necessary secondary to universal precautions against bloodborne pathogens that have been standard-of-care in the healthcare setting. The CDC has provided guidance on standard precautions that should be utilized for all patient care and in diseases where additional transmission-based precautions are necessary.[2, 3]",

Another unique consideration for arthroplasty surgeons is the utilization of surgical hoods (i.e. \u201cspacesuits\u201d). Multiple sources, including formal memos from industry, have stated that this equipment alone is not protective against SARS-CoV-2.[20, 22, 23] These hoods do not filter enough particles in the 0.02 to 1 \u03bcm diameter range to meet the standard for protective respirators.[20] This class of PPE is primarily utilized for protection against in-motion debris and was never designed as a respiratory protection system.[23] Based on current available evidence, surgical hoods can still be used for COVID-19 positive patients, but must be in conjunction with an N95 respirator.[20] Importantly, the ideal technique for proper cleaning of the helmets (including the hard to access fans utilized in the ventilation system) remains to be defined.",

The authors report that this high rate of transmission led to \u201cgreat stress and depression for these surgeons.\u201d Their recommendation, for orthopaedic surgeons working in hospital settings during the pandemic, was to avoid close contact with family members at home.[16] This is obviously a difficult recommendation to follow from both a psychological and pragmatic standpoint. Currently, there is little clinical evidence to guide recommendations. The American College of Surgeons recommends removing and washing clothes immediately upon arrival at home, cleaning cell phones before and after patient care activities, frequent hand washing, and reducing physical contact with family members.[18] In addition, they recommend that healthcare institutions and systems allow for hotel accommodations for healthcare works who cannot, or prefer not to, go home following patient care activities.",
