However, researchers lack sufficient data on the exact HAdV species and serotypes associated with adult acute respiratory tract infections (ARTIs). To detect and characterize HAdV infections in adults in China, clinical specimens were collected from 10,310 adults with ARTIs from May 2005 to July 2010. The partial HAdV hexon gene was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), sequenced, and phylogenetically analyzed. HAdVs were detected in 86 samples (0.8%), of which 67 (77.9%) were species B (HAdV-3, -7, -11, and -14), 7 (8.1%) were species C (HAdV-1, -2, and -6), and 12 (14%) were species E (HAdV-4). HAdV-3 was the most frequently detected serotype (41/86, 47.7%), followed by HAdV-7 (13/86, 15.1%), HAdV-4 (12/86, 14.0%), and HAdV-11 (11/86, 12.8%). Patients 14-25 years old (60.5%) exhibited a higher rate of adenovirus detection than older patients. Coinfections with other respiratory viruses were observed in samples positive for HAdV species B and E. Human rhinovirus was the most commonly found virus in patients with HAdV infection. These findings provide baseline data for the surveillance and control of HAdV infection in China.",

All PCR products were cloned into the pGEM-T Easy Vector (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) and verified by sequence analysis. To verify the results of the HAdV screening assay, 50 samples that were positive according to the screening PCR assay were randomly selected and tested in a second PCR assay targeting the E1A gene and another fragment of the hexon gene. The PCR assays were performed as previously described [7] . Briefly, specimens identified as positive by the HAdV screening assay were subjected to a multiplex PCR assay for species B, C, and E, targeting nt 1042 to 1358, nt 354 to 844, and nt 707 to 929, respectively, of the E1A gene with predicted product sizes of 317 bp, 491 bp, and 222 bp, respectively. The positive samples of species B were subsequently verified using a multiplex PCR assay for serotypes HAdV-3, -7, and -21, targeting nt 796 to 1297, nt 500 to 810, and nt 547 to 783, respectively, of the hexon gene fragment, to produce amplicons of 502 bp, 311 bp, and 237 bp, respectively. The samples positive for HAdV-14, which belongs to species B, were further confirmed using primers that target nt 921 to 1245 of the Ad14 hexon gene to generate a 324-bp product.",

Although HAdV infections are less common in adults than other respiratory virus infections, such as influenza viruses, human rhinoviruses, human parainfluenza viruses, enteroviruses, and human coronaviruses [17] , they can cause fatal respiratory tract infections in affected patients [5, 21] . Moreover, if one extrapolates from the observed HAdV infection rate to the population as a whole, 0.8% could translate to a significant number of HAdV infections related to ARTIs in China on a yearly basis. Our data underscore the important role of HAdV in adult ARTIs in China. The 0.8% detection rate of HAdV in this study is lower than the 2.0 to 9.14% reported in several previously published studies [12, 22, 23] . This disparity cannot be attributed to the detection method used, as our PCR experiments which target a different hexon gene fragment and a different gene (E1A) are consistent with our PCR screening results. This disparity may be attributed to: (1) differences in the age of the study population-the subjects recruited in this study were adults, whereas those in other studies were mainly children [12, 22, 23] . Childhood exposure to some adenovirus serotypes may generate protective immunity in response to the same serotypes, which could lead to the low infection rates observed in adults; (2) the method of sample collection-adenoviruses were detected from nasal and throat swabs of upper respiratory tract infections in this study, whereas those in other studies were recovered from nasal aspirate [23] or autopsied pulmonary tissue of pediatric fatal pneumonia [12] ; (3) the impact of geographical location. The majority of patients (92.7%) recruited in this study came from Beijing. The geographical location can influence the prevalence of respiratory viruses [24, 25] .",

            "text": "In conclusion, this report documents the prevalence and clinical characteristics of HAdV infection in a Chinese adult population with ARTIs from 2005 to 2010. The study identified species B (HAdV-3, -7, -11, and -14), C (HAdV-1, -2, and -6), and E (HAdV-4) from respiratory samples of adults with ARTIs in Beijing. Our results show that human adenovirus B and HAdV-3 are the most frequently detected species and serotype, respectively. Although our findings may not completely reflect the infection of HAdVs circulating in China due to the limited number of HAdV-positive samples and geographical scale, they improve our understanding of the pathogenesis and disease burden of HAdVs in adults.",
