Some key events are listed as a historical timeline of respiratory medicine (Table 1\n).",

Pneumonia finished off Sir Francis Bacon in 1626 as he stuffed a chicken full of snow, Rene Descartes in 1650 as he taught freezing philosophy lessons to Queen Christina of Sweden and Leo Tolstoy in 1910 in a lonely railway station. Tuberculosis (TB) gave John Keats a far from easeful death in 1821 but provided Violetta in 1853 with the best last act of all in La Traviata. And then these two captains of the men of death drifted away. Antibiotics cured them and left the theatre empty for the diseases of dirty air.",

The air became opaque with coal dust underground, while up above asbestos and other factory chemicals were inhaled, lingered in the lungs and slowly scarred them. New chapters were written into books of lung pathology, new X-ray patterns described. Asthma annoyed William of Orange and Charles Dickens but was never a 19th-century celebrity. However, 100 years later, with the help of Bill Clinton and David Beckham, it became a star; allergy replaced psychology as the cause, and big pharma smelt and dealt in gold. Sleep apnoea moved on from Dickens' fat boy snoring in the background to crest the wave of obesity and became the fastest growing branch of lung disease.",

Of course, it had never really left at all, surging on among the malnourished and overcrowded in poorer countries. Drug-resistant bacteria emerged and TB deaths rose again. Pneumonia, too, had never gone away. Osler in the 1920s named it the \u2018old man's friend\u2019 and may have been right for Donald Bradman in 2001 or Ronald Reagan in 2005. But pneumonia was no friend to the increasing numbers of immunocompromised individuals, their defences weakened by malnutrition (George Orwell in \u2018How the poor die\u2019), cancer treatments or, from 1981, HIV (Freddie Mercury in 1991). Other viruses hit the headlines. Spanish flu killed 50 million people in 1918, and since then smaller flu epidemics, severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome have shown that, in spite of vaccination, viruses are still very effective killers.",

He could feel chest movements and tap out different tones with elegant percussive fingers but had no idea of what was going on inside. He could smell anaerobes (new-mown hay with an arri\u00e8re gout of stale faeces) and he could wield a stethoscope as an instrument of erudition rather than knowledge. His drug treatments were herbs \u2013 poppy, willow bark, stramonium, wormwood \u2013 and his surgical skills were few. TB was treated with rest, varying diets and lifestyle changes. Love and sex in particular had to be avoided \u2013 difficult as in sanatoria there was little else to do. Acute infections and fevers were cupped, bled or scarified, partly in order to remove bad humours and partly to structure time while waiting for nature to kill or cure. Did the doctor do more harm than good? No one knew.",

This was followed by a major academic push in the 1950s to understand gas exchange, with attempts to make carbon monoxide transfer and body plethysmography clinically useful. More important, however, were blood gas measurements. Today spirometry is encouraged in primary care, with occasional benefits over peak flow meters, but simple oximeters have become an essential tool of lung medicine.",

Synthetic sulphonamides in the 1930s were toxic and unsuitable for systemic use. Moulds had been used to treat infections for centuries before Fleming investigated penicillin in 1928 (Poland, France, Italy, Belgium and Costa Rica can all claim to have got there first); Florey and Pfizer were essential in taking it on to manufacture in 1942. Then came streptomycin (1944), tetracycline (1945), choramphenicol (1947), erythromycin (1949), isoniazid (1952) and rifampicin (1957). The transition from watching an infection to treating it was dramatic, and it must have been a wonderful era to be a doctor. Close behind came the miracle of cortisone. In 1949, patients with rheumatoid arthritis picked up their beds and walked, and the wonder drug began to cure all known diseases; recreational use led to cortisone parties in New York. By 1955, the benefits and adverse effects had been quickly established clinical observation \u2013 controlled trials take longer. Asthma attacks responded to treatment, and with inhaled corticosteroids came long-term control. Third prize goes to the \u03b2-adrenoreceptor agonists, first isoprenaline, then salbutamol and finally the long-acting \u03b2-adrenoreceptor agonists. Selective \u03b22-adrenoreceptor agonists are among the world's best-selling drugs for asthma, COPD, sporting performance and beef production.",

Drinker's iron lungs (1927) countered respiratory paralysis from polio, other negative-pressure devices \u2013 turtles, ponchos and cuirasses \u2013 being less effective. In the 1980s, non-invasive positive-pressure ventilation took off, and devices have been improving ever since (Figure 2\n), keeping hundreds of thousands of people alive who would, 100 years ago, have died. Linked to this are oxygen delivery devices; cylinders, liquid oxygen reservoirs and cumbersome concentrators have been replaced by neat portable versions weighing less than 2 kg.",

The first efficient metered-dose inhaler, based on perfume spray technology, was launched in 1955 and has lasted well. Dry powder inhaler research started in 1930s; the Aerohaler\u00ae (1949) did not work, the Rotahaler\u00ae (1960s) and Spinhaler\u00ae (1970s) worked to some degree, but the 1990s Turbohaler and Diskhaler were good and there are now over 30 different versions.

Key were endotracheal intubation (1904), anaesthetic gases (chloroform 1847, halothane 1951), antisepsis (1870s), blood groups and safe transfusion (1901), antibiotics (1940s) and, most important of all, brave pioneers. Each new operation builds on the experience of others; artificial pneumothorax (1830s) moved on to thoracoplasty (1880s) and plombage (1920s). The first survival from pneumonectomy was in 1931; the next 16 patients died. Eventually, surgery for TB turned into lung cancer resection in the 1950s. Drainage of pleural fluid was routine from 1850 (Axel Munte describes draining an empyema in a pet ape during a home visit in The Story of San Michele in 1929). Thoracoscopy started in 1910 and advanced in the 1970s with fibreoptics. It has since developed into video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery for investigation of pleural disease, lung biopsy, treatment of pneumothorax and simple resections. Lung transplantation opened new and wonderful prospects for end-stage lung disease with the first successful operations in the 1970s and has now become routine, albeit limited by scarcity of donor organs.",

These were alongside but separate from hospitals and endured professional snobbery. General physicians looked down on chest physicians (\u2018Chest \u2013 yes, physician \u2013 never\u2019) before the systems were integrated in the 1960s. Today, the lung specialist is often the best general physician. TB nurses morphed, after a brief spell in the wilderness, into respiratory nurses with their own training programmes. Some work in primary care and some are specialist nurses in hospitals and have been joined by respiratory therapists, specialist physiotherapists, lung function measurers, psychologists and the rest.
