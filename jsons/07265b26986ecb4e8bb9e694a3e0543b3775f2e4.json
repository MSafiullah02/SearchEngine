A common characteristic of previous infectious disease outbreaks, most notably in the West African Ebola outbreak 2013-2016, is that post-peak epidemics are typically characterised by small focal outbreaks of disease occurring in disparate regions at different times. Spatial heterogeneity in incidence was observed in the UK for pandemic influenza, and the COVID-19 epidemic in the UK is exhibiting spatial heterogeneities. The ability to detect such spatial outbreaks is therefore key to efficient local containment, preventing local foci of infection degenerating into a nationally resurgent epidemic wave.",

Such potential risk factors are routinely collected via Census information at geographically small scales, such as Lower Super Output Area. Thus there is a pressing need for reliable COVID-19 case reporting data at a spatial resolution to match underlying covariate data.",

As of 8th May 2020, these data contain 129320 cases attributed to a LTLA.

Parameter inference is performed using maximum likelihood estimation in the R package \"surveillance\" (version 1.18, Meyer et al. , 2017) and R version 3.6.3, allowing us to calculate the contribution to incidence in each region due to the intrinsic, within-region autoregressive, and between-region autoregressive terms. This allows us to distinguish between regions with unusually high incidence due to within-region epidemics, and those with unusually high transmission emanating from other areas. An advantage of this method is in its rapidity, with models fitting within minutes in order to provide real-time estimates of epidemic risk.",

The choropleth maps in Figure 4 show the contribution to disease incidence of the within-and between-region autoregressive parts of the model and intrinsic component. The three components should be interpreted together. The Intrinsic component of the model establishes a baseline incidence across the whole of England, exhibiting a small linear decrease with respect to time (relative risk 0.978 (0.976, 0.980) per day, see Table S1 ). The Within-and Between-region maps then outline departures from this overall trend. The Within-region map identifies regions that are primarily driven by a local epidemic process, such that the outbreak may be considered still increasing in these regions. County Durham, King's Lynn and West Norfolk, and Ashford are particularly affected, together with other regions of the North West. The Between-region map indicates regions in which incidence is primarily driven by importation of infection from other parts of the country. Rural areas (in particular Eden and Penrith) are highlighted as having cases driven by external force of infection, though themselves are less likely to sustain ongoing transmission at the local level (being blue in the Within-region map). Time-series plots of the three model components are shown in Figure S1 for 4 arbitrarily chosen LTLAs. Figure 4 , this may be interpreted as a region-specific propensity to generate more cases given the current number of infected individuals, and is analogous (but not equal!) to a region-specific reproduction number. There is evidence for a spatially diverse set of regions having a higher daily increase of cases than others, having accounted for current case numbers, population size, and human mobility. South and West Cumbria leads these regions, with unusually high within-region incidence. Figure 5 (right) shows the standard error associated with each estimate of the random effect, providing a quantification of uncertainty about the disease process in each LTLA. There are clear regions of the country where uncertainty is markedly higher than elsewhere, indicating an equality in our current understanding of the disease process.

PHE has recently released LTLA-level data publicly, providing an opportunity to more fully exploit spatial analytic powers. Additionally, several factors that have been shown to contribute to risk from COVID-19 have been identified, including age, comorbidities, and possibly social deprivation and ethnicity. These factors show marked variation at small spatial scales, for example within a single town, and higher resolution case data may allow us to account for these variables to improve our predictions. As an example, Figure S3 shows the GB-wide geographical variation, at Lower Super Output Area (LSOA)-level spatial resolution, in the rate of positive symptom reporting by users of the COVID-19 Symptom Tracker App developed by King's College London and ZOE (https://covid.joinzoe.com/) in the 14 days to 16 April 2020 . Local symptom incidence shows a five-fold variation (upper left panel), albeit with relatively wide lower 5% and upper 95% probability limits (lower panels).
