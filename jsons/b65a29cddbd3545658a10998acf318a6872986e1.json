The approach also allows changes to be engineered into a DNA fragment by designing primers that incorporate the restriction site and the mutations of interest. By adding the type IIs restriction site in the proper orientation, subsequent digestion removes the restriction site and leaves a sticky end comprising the mutation of interest ready to ligate to a second fragment generated in parallel as its complement. In this chapter, we discuss the details of the method to assemble a full-length infectious clone of MHV and then engineer a specific mutation into the clone to demonstrate the power of this unique site-directed \"No See'm\" mutagenesis approach.",

            "text": "Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) strain A59 is an extensively studied group 2 coronavirus (CoV). Its genome is an approximately 31.5-kb single-stranded positive-sense RNA, which contains a 5 cap and poly(A) tail (1,2). The first two-thirds of the genome encodes the nonstructural proteins required for viral RNA replication and transcription, and the final third comprises six additional open reading frames (ORFs) from which a nested set of 3 co-terminal subgenomic mRNAs is transcribed (Figs. 1A,B,3C) . Upon entry into the cell, the Fig. 1 . The MHV genome, subgenomic transcription, and strategy for infectious clone assembly: (A) The MHV genome is \u223c31.5 kb, with the first two-thirds comprising the nonstructural replicase genes required for viral RNA synthesis (gray rectangle), and the final third encoding the structural genes important for assembly of the viral particle (large black rectangle). The 5 -end is capped and contains a leader sequence (small black box) and the 3 -end has a poly(A) tail. (B) The structural and accessory genes are encoded as a nested set of co-terminal mRNAs, each of which contains the leader sequence derived from the 5 -end of the genome and a poly(A) tail. (C) For assembly of an infectious clone of MHV, the genome was divided into seven stable contiguous cDNA fragments known as MHV-A, MHV-B, MHV-C, MHV-D, MHV-E, MHV-F, and MHV-G. Unique type IIs restriction sites were used to generate unique junctions, which when ligated together produce a full-length cDNA. This allows manipulation of any region of the genome by targeting the fragment of interest and engineering No See'm sites to incorporate the mutation. In this example we target genomic position 13354-56 (indicated by \u2022), which falls within the MHV-E fragment. Numbers on top of the assembled genome indicate fragment sizes, while bottom numbers represent genomic positions. N-encapsidated viral RNA is released from the virion and immediately translated by host machinery, resulting in large polyprotein precursors, which are autocleaved to generate intermediates and eventually 16 mature proteins, most of which are thought to function in viral RNA synthesis (3-6). The subgenomic mRNAs are generated from a similar-sized subgenomic negative strand, which is synthesized only after the viral replication complex is functional. The negative subgenomic RNA serves as a template for transcription of similar-sized subgenomic mRNAs, which contain the leader sequence as well as the ORF that encodes the protein directly downstream of the leader sequence (7-10). All subgenomic mRNAs are co-terminal, with each subsequent mRNA containing the sequence for all downstream ORFs, although only the 5 -most ORF is translated. This allows for rapid detection of viral replication by RT-PCR using primers that anneal to the leader and the N-gene, which results in a ladder of different sized products (Figs. 1B,3B,C) (7-10).",

Our laboratory developed a full-length molecular clone of MHV-A59 (icMHV) by implementing a No See'm approach (Figs. 1C,2A,B ) (13). Our strategy was to divide the genome into pieces that could be stably subcloned into E. coli-based plasmids to facilitate targeted mutagenesis studies and would be easy DNA to store and maintain, using the same approach that was successful with the transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) infectious clone (13,14) (Figs. 1C,2A,B) .

Colonies are isolated and grown overnight at room temperature (see Note 6); the DNA is harvested and inserts verified by a screening restriction digestion. It is important to screen the DNA prior to setting up the large-scale preps to ensure plasmid integrity. We typically harvest 50-75 g of each plasmid DNA, restrict the DNA with the appropriate restriction endonucleases, and purify the viral cDNAs from agarose gels. It is equally important to keep the digested fragments free of contaminants, including residual carbohydrates from the gel extraction procedure or contamination with other fragments, particularly a wild-type version of a mutated fragment (see Note 2). Following gel extraction, chloroform extractions are performed to ensure that all carbohydrate contaminants are removed prior to preparing the ligation reaction (see Note 4).",

For pCR-XL-Topo cloning vector encodes kanamycin resistance, whereas the pSMART vector encodes ampicillin resistance (pSMART vectors are available with kanamycin or ampicillin resistance; in this case it is ampicillin). LB broth and LB agar plates with each antibiotic are required for growing the newly transformed bacteria. Although other vector-fragment combinations exist, we focus on the following in this report: pCR-XL-Topo-MHV-A, pSMART-MHV-B, pSMART-MHV-C, pSMART-MHV-D, pSMART-MHV-E, pSMART-MHV-F, and pSMART-MHV-G (13). Plasmids are stored at approximately 20 ng/l at -80 \u2022 C. 2. Thaw each plasmid and the chemically competent Top10 cells (one vial per plasmid) on ice. Add 100 ng of each plasmid to an appropriately labeled vial of cells (50 l) and incubate on ice for 30 min. 3. Transform the cells by heat shock in a water bath maintained at 42 \u2022 C for 2 min, followed by 2 min on ice. 4. Add 200 l SOC medium (without antibiotic) and rock the vials at room temperature for 2 h. 5. Inoculate two LB plates (with appropriate antibiotic) for each plasmid, using 25 l and 100 l of culture and incubate the plates at room temperature for 48 h. 6. Pick at least five colonies of each plasmid (from one or both plates) and inoculate each into a 15-ml conical containing 5 ml of LB broth with appropriate antibiotic. Grow the colonies for 16-24 h at 28.5 \u2022 C in an incubator shaker set at 250 rpm. We have found that plasmid stability is enhanced at the lower temperature. 7. Prepare a library plate by inoculating an LB agar plate (with appropriate selection) with 25 l of the supernatant of each colony. The library plate should contain all of the colonies for one plasmid, and is grown at room temperature for 16-24 h and then stored at 4 \u2022 C. Then spin the cultures at 3000 \u00d7 g for 10 min at 4 \u2022 C, aspirate, and discard the supernatant. 8. Plasmids are isolated from E. coli using the Qiagen Miniprep Kit, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Follow the plasmid DNA purification scheme using the Qiaprep Spin Miniprep Kit and a microcentrifuge protocol, and elute the plasmid DNA in 50 l of elution buffer preheated to 70 \u2022 C. 9.

We typically recover between 1000 and 10,000 plaques (infectious center assay) following electroporation of transcripts. CPE is very obvious for DBT cells infected with MHV. Excess spike glycoproteins accumulate at and protrude from the cell surface, which facilitates fusion with the neighboring cells. This creates large multinucleated syncytia, which are usually observed by 8-12 h posttransfection. As the cells die, they lift off the flask, and so an efficient transfection of full-length viral RNA will result in a rapid clearing of the monolayer, usually within 16-24 h. 2. Mutants generally come up more slowly and may take up to 72 h for CPE to be obvious. Highly debilitated mutants may not display obvious CPE. Passage usually selects for second-site revertant viruses that replicate efficiently, so extensive passage usually results in recombinant viruses containing multiple mutant alleles scattered across the genome.

Avoid passage of highly attenuated mutant viruses because reversions to wild-type and second-site reversions occur rapidly upon passage. Well over a hundred mutants have been engineered into the clone of MHV using this approach, which far exceeds the number for all other coronavirus reverse genetic systems reported. Moreover, this technology has been used to rapidly develop reagents in response to newly identified emerging coronaviruses. For example, SARS-CoV was identified in the fall of 2002, and a full-length infectious clone was available the summer of 2003 (16). Piecemeal assembly of smaller subclones is within range of commercial DNA synthesis companies, allowing for synthetic reconstruction of coronavirus genomes. However, attempts to reconstruct other coronavirus genomes using this method have proven more difficult. Current problem areas that must be solved for the advancement of this technology include: (a) unreliable sequence information in the public databases; (b) mistake-prone amplification and cloning of AT-rich genomes (such as in human coronavirus NL63); (c) clone stability and sequence toxicity issues with different viruses; (d) size issues of the different fragments for different viruses; and (e) cell tropism issues with newly identified animal viruses (Bat CoV).",

Purify plasmids using the Qiaprep Miniprep Kit, and elute to a final volume of 50 l in elution buffer heated to 70 \u2022 C. Combine all three 50-l aliquots of each fragment in a single tube. 4. Digest the plasmids as follows: a. pCR-XL-Topo-MHV-A: 150 l plasmid, 10 l MluI, 20 l NEB Buffer 3, 20 l water. Incubate at 55 \u2022 C for 1.5 h. Add 5 l of CIP and incubate at 37 \u2022 C for 1 h. CIP catalyzes the removal of 5 phosphate groups from DNA, which prevents concatamers of MHV-A from occurring during ligation (15). CIP cannot be completely heat inactivated, so the reaction is chloroform extracted and isopropanol precipitated at this point to remove the CIP. i. For the chloroform extraction all steps are performed at room temperature: Add 25 l of water, 50 l 3 M sodium acetate, and 275 l of chloroform to the reaction. Shake by hand for 2 min, and then spin at full speed in a microcentrifuge for 2 min. Remove the aqueous phase to a fresh tube and add an equal volume of isopropanol. Incubate at room temperature for 10 min, followed by centrifugation at full speed in a microcentrifuge for 10 min. Remove the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 1 ml of 70% ethanol. Spin for 5 min at full speed, remove the supernatant, and resuspend in 95% ethanol. Spin for 5 min, remove supernatant, and air-dry the pellet for no more than 5 min.

            "text": "Quantitate each purified MHV fragment with a UV spectrophotometer (optional). 2. Set up a shotgun ligation by adding relatively equivalent amounts of each fragment to a fresh 1.5-ml microfuge tube. For example, add 25 l of each of the fragments with the lowest concentrations, 20 l for fragments of intermediate concentrations, and only 15 l of fragments with the highest concentrations, achieving a goal of relatively equivalent numbers of molecules of each fragment in the ligation mix (1 g of 1000 bp DNA = 1.52 pmol = 9.1 \u00d7 10 11 molecules). The reaction size will vary each time but a typical reaction is similar to this: a. 20 l of MHV-A. b. 25 l of MHV-B. c. 25 l of MHV-C. d. 25 l of MHV-D. e. 25 l of MHV-E. f. 15 l of MHV-F. g. 20 l of MHV-G. h. 15 l of water. i. 20 l of 10X ligation buffer. j. 10 l of ligase. k.

Chloroform extract and isopropanol precipitate the reaction as described above (Section 3.2.4.a.i), and resuspend the cDNA pellet in 10 l of DepC water heated to 70 \u2022 C. 4. In vitro transcription of the full-length cDNA construct is conducted using the mMessage mMachine T7 Transcription Kit using the following recipe per reaction: a. 7.5 l of GTP (30 mM). b. 25 l 2X NTP/CAP (15 mM ATP, 15 mM CTP, 15 mM UTP, 3 mM GTP, and 12 mM cap analog). c. 5 l 10X Buffer. d. 7.5 l of full-length cDNA template. e. 5 l enzyme (RNA polymerase). f. Incubate the reaction at 40.5 \u2022 C for 25 min, then at 37 \u2022 C for 50 min, and then at 40.5 \u2022 C for 25 min additional. Use a PCR-cycler for most consistent results. g. The remaining 2.5 l of the ligation reaction and 5 l of the RNA transcription reaction can be run on a gel to determine if full-length ligation occurred and whether in vitro transcription was successful (Fig. 3A). Use LE Agar (0.5%w/v) for the gel with 10% SDS added to the gel buffer and the running buffer. Treat 5 l of RNA with DNAse and then add 2 l of 10% SDS and 4 l 5 mM EDTA prior to running the gel. For optimal resolution run the gel overnight at 30 mA. 5. Preparation of SP6-N-gene. Primers for adding the SP6 promoter onto the N-gene have been published previously (13). Use these primers (10 mM) along with the In vitro assembly of full-length cDNAs and transcripts and the recovery of infectious virus: (A) Running the cDNA from an assembly ligation results in a ladder of intermediates, as well as a full-length product \u223c31.5 kb. After in vitro transcription, running RNA on a gel results in a smear of RNA including a full-length viral RNA, which runs at 16-17 kb. (B) Detecting viral replication can be accomplished using primers that anneal to the leader sequence and the N-gene. Using the antisense primer to perform reverse transcription and then both primers to amplify the target via RT-PCR generates a series of bands corresponding to several subgenomic mRNAs. (C) A northern blot showing the seven mRNAs of icMHV, using a probe that anneals to the 300 5 nucleotides of the N-gene allows detection of genomic and all subgenomic mRNAs. 1 l of purified MHV-G fragment (Section 3.2, step 8) per reaction and reagents from the Expand Long Kit as follows: a. 1 l cDNA from MHV-G fragment. b. 1 l sense primer (10 mM). c. 1 l antisense primer (10 mM). d. 1.75 l dNTP (10 mM). e. 5 l Buffer #1. f. 0.75 l Expand Taq. g. 39.5 l water.",

Resuspend the trypsinized cells in 8 ml of medium and transfer cells from all three flasks to a sterile 50-ml conical. c. Spin the cells at \u223c2000 \u00d7 g for 5 min and remove the medium, leaving the pellet in the conical. d. Resuspend the pellet in 10 ml of ice-cold PBS and spin at 2000 \u00d7 g for 5 min. e. Remove the PBS and resuspend the pellet in an additional 10 ml of ice-cold PBS. f. Transfer 10 l of the cell suspension to a hemocytometer for counting, and spin the remaining suspension at \u223c2000 \u00d7 g for 5-10 min, while counting the cells. g. Remove the PBS from the cells and resuspend the pellet in the volume of PBS that will give a concentration of 10 7 cells/ml. Counting 10 l of cells from a 10ml preparation translates into 10 4 cells per 1 mm 2 (grid of 16 squares arranged 4 \u00d7 4) on the hemocytometer. Count all the cells in three of the 16 square grids and average them. Then, multiply this number by 1 \u00d7 10 4 , which gives the concentration in cells/ml. In general, to get to a final concentration of 1 \u00d7 10 7 cells/ml resuspend the final pellet in 1/100 of the final count. For example, if the final average count is 200 cells, this would calculate to 2.0 \u00d7 10 6 cells/ml in a 10-ml volume for a total of 2.0 \u00d7 10 7 cells.
