Transmission from flying foxes to horses has not been demonstrated; however, experimental infections in a range of species, and investigations of natural infections in flying foxes and in horses have suggested possible modes of transmission[15 J \u2022 It has been hypothesised that spillover from flying foxes to horses is effected by contact with infected foetal tissues or fluids, most probably via the ingestion of recently con-",

The disease in pigs was highly contagious, and characterized by acute fever with respiratory involvement and sometimes nervous signs in all age classes. The predominant clinical syndrome in humans was encephalitic, and a small amount of patients appeared atypical pneumonia. The majority of human cases had a history of direct contact with live pigs. Most were pig farmers or slaughterhouse workers. Transmission was via wound, secretion or egesta of infected pigs, such as saliva, urine, dejection, nasal mucus, and also blood or breathed out gas. The main presenting features were fever, headache, dizziness, and vomiting. Some patients had a reduced level of consciousness and prominent brain-stem dysfunction. Distinctive clinical signs included segmental myoclonus, areflexia and hypotonia, hypertension, and tachycardia. Typical cases died in 6 d after infection. No spreading of Nipah virus among humans was reported [6] . Besides the outbreak of NiV disease, there was also Japanese encephalitis in Malaysia. The workers probably had been infected with Japanese encephalitis virus before NiV infection, so there was also antibodies to Japanese encephalitis virus in NiV infected patients. But Japanese encephalitis virus is not a causitive agent in the outbreak of NiV disease [20] . Based on the fact that NiV has a close relationship with HeV whose natural hosts are flying foxes, 1180 so Malaysia bat species became a logical surveillance priority. Malaysia has a great diversity of bat species. There are at least 13 species of fruit bats, and at least 60 species of insectivorous bats described in Peninsular Malaysia alone. Blood and tissue samples were collected from 324 bats from 14 species and submitted for serological test. Neutralising antibodies to NiV were found in 21 bats from five species (four species of fruit bats, and one insectivorous species) [21] . Later, NiV was isolated from urine of Malaysia flying foxes (P hypomelanusp2]. All these proved that fruit bats are the natural reservoir ofNiV 3 Viruses hosted by bats and their latent endangerment In recent years, a novel paramyxovirus named Tioman virus was isolated from the urine of fruit bats (P hypomelanus) after the cluster emergences of HeY, Menangle virus and NiY, and this virus has a close relationship with Menangle virus [23] . In addition, a novel virus of the genus Lyssavirus was isolated from an Australian black fly fox (P alecto). This virus had a unique serotype and was named Australian bat lyssavirus (ABLP4]. In fact, bats likely act as a natural reservoir of viruses. Some 40 viruses have been isolated from bats during the past four decades. The list of isolated viruses includes members of the Rhabdoviridae, including rabies [25] and rabies-related virus [26] , smaller numbers of representatives from among the Alphaviridae [27, 28] , Reoviridae [29] , Arenaviridae [30] and Herpesviridae [31] . Quite a mount of these are zoonotic viruses and their dissemination and transmission are far out of being imagined, forming a latent endangerment to health of human and animals.",

            "text": "Bats belong to the Order Chiroprera, which is the second large Order in mammalia. At present there are about 1000 recognized species worldwide, making up almost a quarter of all known mammal species. Bats are divided into two suborders, the Megachiroptera and the Microchiroptera. All of the Megachiroptera consume fruits, flowers and/or flower products, so they are called fruit bats, while the Microchiroptera feed on insects. There are 41 genera containing a total of 173 species in Megachiroptera and the largest and best known genus is Pteropus commonly referred to as flying foxes, which has 59 species [34, 35] The single megachiropteran family, the Pteropodidae, ranges from Africa, the eastern Mediterranean, Madagascar and the Indian Ocean islands in the west, across mainland southern Asia, throughout the islands of the west Pacific from the Ryukyu Archipelago and Ogasawara-shato in the north, to coastal eastern Australia, new Caledonia and the Loyalty Islands in the south, and east to Fiji, Tonga, Samoa and the Cook Islands [33] . Many species are restricted to islands, while a number of them are widespread. Fruit bats range in body weight from 300 g to over 1 kg, and in wingspan from 600 mm to 1.7 m. They are the largest bats in the world, most of them do not echolocate and navigate at night by eyesight and their keen sense of smell. Females of Pteropus usually have only one young a year after a 6-month pregnancy. The young grow rapidly but are dependent on their mother for up to 3 months. All species eat plant products (most commonly fruits, flowers and pollen) and roost communally in trees or den [33] [34] [35] [36] . Fruit bats are known to travel over considerable distances. There is a record of a little red flying fox in New Zealand, 2000 km from its southernmost Australian occurrence, and a sighting of India flying foxes (Pteropus giganteus) 320 km from land [35, 36] . Some kinds of fruit bats move from one camp to another continuously on feeding habits. These movements cause fluctuating numbers in their camps and indicate that over their whole range the population is in a state of flux [32] [33] [34] [35] .",

Most young plants cannot develop normally in the shadow of parent trees or when restrained by toxins secreted by parent trees. Therefore, seed dispersal away from parent trees is an absolute necessity. Fruit bats consume a large amount of fruits and eject the seeds through the mouth or anus, thus transporting them to remote places, where these seeds can germinate and grow up to full size. Some seeds, such as those contained in many figs, pullulate only when seeds have passed through the intestinal tract of birds or fruit bats. Finally, flower-visiting fruit bats which are attracted by the flower's pollen and nectar for food, also often pollinate these flowers in the ecosystem. Unfortunately, in wide areas of South East Asia, the beneficial effects from many species of fruits have dramatically declined because the numbers in fruit bat populations have plummeted [33] .",

The half-eaten or digested fruits contaminated by fruit bats could then easily be ingested by pigs, thus eventually spreading the NiY, which is fatal, among humans as well [38] .

However, the ecology and behaviour of these bats remain, despite some very patchy preliminary work, largely unknown. Fruit bats generally home in the tropics or subtropics [41] . Hence, the records of Pteropus dasymallus from Shannxi and P giganteus from Qinghai do not represent their natural distribution. Instead, these specimens must have reached these locations either by having been drifted there by strong winds or by having been displaced by unnatural means by humans. In recent years, the only species we usually encounter in our field surveys are Rousettus leschenaulti and Cynopterus sphinx. Adult Rousettus leschenaulti have a body weight of about 100 g and wingspan of 450 mm, with the female being slightly larger than the male. The fur on the back is brown and the flanks are dust-colored. During the day, they communally roost in caves or in forests of bamboo, bananas or other trees providing cover and fly out to forage at night. Cynopterus sphinx, which is smaller in size, seeks cover amidst branches of coco or palm trees, forming small round clusters. Rousettus leschenaulti can still be found often forming large colonies, thousands of individuals strong in a single cave. They consume large amounts of longan and lichee, sometimes causing significant losses for the farmers.",

The virus is a previously undescribed member of the family Paramyxoviridae, which was initially named equine morbillivirus, but was subsequently re-named Hendra virus (HeV) [1,2 J \u2022 From April to September 1997, a new virus of the Paramyxoviridae family, called Menangle virus, was recognized in a commercial piggery in New South Wales of Australia. It led to abortion of pregnant sows and stillborn piglets[3 J \u2022 In addition, the agent also caused influenza-type illness in two workers at the piggery[4 J \u2022 Nipah virus (HiV) led to an outbreak of disease in pigs in Peninsular Malaysia between September 1998 and April 1999 and had caused thousands of deaths. It spread to human in several weeks since the emergence of this virus and resulted in the death of 105 humans among 265 reported cases[5,6 J \u2022 Indirect immunofluorescent test of the cerebrospinal fluid samples of the died patients indicated that anti-NiV antibody was positive. IgG and IgM capture ELISA showed that patients had IgG or IgM antibodies to NiV The agent was proved a HeV-like virus, but the epidemiological characteristics and clinic symptom were distinct from that caused by HeV So the new virus was named Nipah virus[7,8 J \u2022 According to the molecular phylogenetic study, NiV is most closely raleted to HeV within Paramyxoviridae and both are considered belonging to the same new genus[9 J \u2022",
