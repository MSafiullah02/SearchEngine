Respirology 2007; 12: 531-542 Background and objective: The temporal importance of prognostic indicators for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) has not been studied. This study identified the various clinical prognostic factors for SARS and described the temporal evolution of these factors in the course of the SARS illness in Hong Kong in 2003. Methods: A retrospective analysis of the entire Hong Kong cohort of 1312 laboratory-confirmed SARS patients aged 15-74 years was undertaken. Demographic, clinical and laboratory data at presentation and investigative data during the first 10 days of illness from the time of symptom onset were compiled. Two adverse outcomes were examined: hospital mortality and the development of oxygenation failure based on the estimated PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio of <200 mm Hg. Logistic regression was used to identify the association between these prognostic factors and outcomes. Results: Based on adjusted odds ratios with a P-value of <0.05, older age, male gender, elevated pulse rate and elevated neutrophil count were all predictive of oxygenation failure and death during the 10-day illness. Raised serum albumin and creatinine phosphokinase (CPK) levels were predictive of hospital mortality during this period. The presenting ALT and CPK level and the day 7 and day 10 platelet counts were predictive of oxygenation failure while the day 7 LDH was predictive of death. Contact exposure outside health-care institutions also appeared to carry higher risk of death. Conclusion: This large-scale analysis identified important discriminatory parameters related to the patients' demographic profile (age and gender), severity of illness (pulse rate and neutrophil count), and multisystem derangement (platelet count, CPK, ALT and LDH), all of which prognosticated adverse outcomes during the SARS episode. While age, pulse rate and neutrophil count consistently remained significant prognosticators during the first 10 days of illness, the prognostic impact of other derangements was more time-course dependent. Clinicians should be aware of the time-course evolution of these prognosticators.",

In 2003 it affected over 8000 patients worldwide with nearly 800 deaths, including 1755 infected patients and nearly 300 deaths in Hong Kong. 1 Over those few months, scientific knowledge and clinical experience with SARS grew rapidly, from initially making a diagnosis based on a constellation of clinical and epidemiological findings, 2 to one supported by laboratory confirmation. 3 The current World Health Organization (WHO) criteria for SARS comprise both clinical considerations and laboratory confirmation. 4 Although much has been written on SARS prognostication [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] the studies are limited by their sample size, by the inclusion of patients based purely on clinical case definition 5, 6 and by the use of early outcome indicator(s), such as the day 21 mortality 5-7 which might not represent the eventual outcome for the group. Prognosticators so far identified included: age, the most consistently found prognostic factor, 5-10,12 comorbidities, [6] [7] [8] 12 admission tachycardia, 12 a high presenting neutrophil count, 5, 9 LDH 9, 10 and creatinine phosphokinase (CPK). 12 More extensive radiographic changes are also associated with adverse outcomes. 8, [12] [13] [14] [15] While previous studies largely agree on the prognostic role of age, comorbidities presenting tachycardia and presenting neutrophil count, the prognostic role of other clinical parameters such as LDH and CPK captured at various time-points in different studies 9,10,12 remains ill-defined.",

The exclusion of the elderly group was to avoid the possible skewed influence of the non-aggressive treatment decision made at times by the care team in conjunction with the patient and/or patient's family. As this is a retrospective review of clinical information, in which the clinical investigators were blinded to the patients' confidential personal data, this study did not require informed consent.",

Clinical data on comorbidities, daily vital signs and details of drugs, oxygen and ventilatory therapies were all manually abstracted from the medical records by clinical staff using a standardized data entry form for all hospitals. Comorbidities were defined to include COPD, cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular accident, active cancer, diabetes mellitus, chronic renal insufficiency, and chronic liver disease. CXRs were retrospectively scored by 'blinded' radiologists in accordance with a 5-point scale for each of the six lung zones (zero for zero lung opacification, 1 for 1-25%, 2 for 26-50%, 3 for 51-75% and 4 for 76-100%), summating to a range of 0-24 score points. 15 Radiographic scorings were confined to five milestones: at presentation, commencement of ribavirin treatment if any, commencement of pulse \u2020 The 19 March 2003 HA case definition of probable SARS required (i) the presence of new radiological infiltrates compatible with pneumonia; (ii) fever at or above 38\u00b0C; and (iii) the presence of at least two of the following: (a) chills; (b) new or increased cough; (c) new or increased shortness of breath; and (d) typical physical findings of consolidation.

The presenting laboratory and radiological readings represented the first reading within 5 days of admission, or for inpatients with hospital-acquired SARS, of symptom onset; for studied time-points other than at presentation, the readings were chosen based on the following priority order: current day, 1 day before and 1 day after. This central database was intensively verified and cleaned by a team of clinical staff directly supervised by the authors.

Judged by the C-index (i.e. area under receiver operating characteristic curve), the mortality models for the three time-points indicated a fairly strong discriminatory power (0.86, 0.85 and 0.90, respectively) compared with the oxygenation failure models (0.77, 0.77 and 0.74, respectively). Similarly, given that the P-value of the Hosmer-Lemeshow test did not indicate a lack of fit for the six models (all with P > 0.05), the mortality models showed a better model fit than the counterparts except for the day 10 oxygenation failure model, which showed the best model fit (P = 0.86).",

Day 7 LDH, but not presenting or day 10 LDH, was a significant prognosticator of death but not of oxygenation failure. In another earlier study, the high LDH found in SARS patients had been attributed to the release of LDH isoenzyme 1 (LD1) by blood erythrocytes rather than by the myocardium. 11 Although one could postulate that lysis of blood erythrocytes was the major process contributing to a high LDH level on day 7, we were unable to identify a parallel decrease in Hb. This study further confirmed that the presenting CPK is an important predictor of oxygenation failure and death, and also that the presenting ALT is a newly found prognosticator of oxygenation failure. By day 10, CPK predicted death but not oxygenation failure. All in all, at the onset of illness there appeared to be tissue injury in the liver and muscles in parallel with lung injury, and the extent of muscle injury not only predicted lung injury, but also impacted on death. By day 10, in those patients spared oxygenation failure, ongoing non-lung tissue injuries, as reflected by LDH and CPK, impacted on survival.",

            "text": "This unique description of the temporal evolution of prognosticators over the first 10 days of illness provides insights into yet another evolving process which contributed to mortality. By days 7-10 of illness, serum albumin became predictive of death, but not of oxygenation failure. In other words, patients spared oxygenation failure might still die if they demonstrated poor nutritional/metabolic state (as reflected by the serum albumin). Interestingly, the serum albumin in this analysis might have served as a surrogate marker for 'the presence of comorbidities', a variable well described in other studies as a prognosticator. 6, 8, 12 While prognostic factors may simply serve as severity or surrogate markers of the viral insult and/or host response, the possible pathogenic role of platelets needs to be considered. This study showed thrombocytopaenia in 36% and deranged APTT in 26% of the cohort on presentation; the former seen in 40% in the Vietnamese cohort 31 and the latter in 42.8% of Yang's cohort. 32 Based on the finding of an elevated d-dimer in 45% 5 and of disseminated intravascular coagulopathy in 2.5% 33 of a smaller Hong Kong cohort, the mechanism of the observed thrombocytopaenia is likely to be consumptive in nature. Both this study and the Vietnamese study 31 have shown that the platelet and APTT abnormalities observed during the first week of illness were usually transient. The finding of thrombocytopaenia persisting to days 7 and 10 being predictive of oxygenation failure but not of death may implicate platelet aggregation and consumptive coagulopathy in the pathogenesis of acute lung injury in SARS. While ongoing endothelial damage from infection, oxygen therapy and artificial ventilation has been postulated as the mechanism for platelet fragmentation and consumption, 32 our timecourse analysis shows that thrombocytopaenia observed as early as days 7 and 10 (before intubation), was associated with eventual lung failure. Thrombocytopaenia observed during this stage of SARS is unlikely to be iatrogenic and is more likely to be a virally mediated systemic inflammatory response. The reported elevation of certain pro-inflammatory cytokines in the acute illness 34, 35 further supports a heightened role of inflammation in the pathogenesis of SARS.",
