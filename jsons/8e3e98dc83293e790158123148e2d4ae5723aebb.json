In response to this 24 ongoing shortage, we began production of VTM in-house in support of diagnostic testing in our 25 hospital network. As our diagnostic laboratory was not equipped for reagent production, we took 26 advantage of space and personnel that became available due to closure of the research division of 27 our medical center. We utilized a formulation of VTM described by the CDC that was simple to 28 produce, did not require filtration for sterilization, and used reagents that were available from 29 commercial suppliers. Performance of VTM was evaluated by several quality assurance 30 measures. Based on Ct values of spiking experiments, we found that our VTM supported highly 31 consistent amplification of the SARS-CoV-2 target (coefficient of variation = 2.95%) using the 32 Abbott RealTime SARS-CoV-2 EUA assay on the Abbott m2000 platform. VTM was also found 33 to be compatible with multiple swab types and, based on accelerated stability studies, able to 34 maintain functionality for at least four months at room temperature. We further discuss how we 35 met logistical challenges associated with large-scale VTM production in a crisis setting including 36 use of staged, assembly line for VTM transport tube production.",

The ideal specimen type is currently believed to be a nasopharyngeal (NP) swab 41 specimen transported to a molecular microbiology laboratory in viral transport medium (VTM). 42 Starting in March 2020, increasing demand for testing led to a national shortage of both NP 43 swabs and VTM that created significant bottlenecks in large-scale testing efforts. We discuss a 44 nationwide collaborative effort produce 3-D printed swabs to address the former bottleneck in a 45 separate manuscript (1). Here, we describe processes for large-scale, local production of VTM in 46 large scale within the framework of a rigorous quality assurance program as a model to address 47 unmet need for diagnostic supplies in a crisis setting. 48 VTM exists in several formulations, all of which consist of a buffered salt solution, a 49 complex source of protein and/or amino acids, and antimicrobial agents. Its purpose is to 50 preserve virus for later amplification by NAAT technology and/or viral culture. Although 51 simpler formulations, for example, saline, are technically compatible with RT-PCR, most NAAT 52 assays for respiratory pathogens have been developed and FDA-cleared for use with more 53 complex transport media (i.e. VTM and universal transport medium, UTM). Further, stability of 54 virus in saline over time may not be ideal, leading to degradation of viral nucleic acid, a 55 particular concern for single-stranded RNA viruses such as SARS-CoV-2, and ultimately 56 compromise detection. Overgrowth of bacteria may also occur in media lacking antimicrobial 57 agents. As such, we chose to reproduce a standard of care transport medium to serve our 58 healthcare network. ",
