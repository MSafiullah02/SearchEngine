Indeed, it is misleading to use the term \u2018system\u2019 when in fact there are many health-care systems, sometimes operating simultaneously, within the same country. For this reason, intergovernmental cooperation among the federal, provincial, and territorial governments \u2013 along with significant nongovernmental health-care stakeholders \u2013 is so prominent in the financing, administration, and delivery of public health care in Canada. This article describes the political and administrative organization of health care in Canada, including its intergovernmental dimensions for conventional as well as alternative medicine and public health, and the relationship of each with conventional illness care. Since Canadians have played a major role in the development of the determinants of health approach to health policy internationally, this history is briefly recounted.",

Most of the health professions are self-regulated under provincial government laws that set out a general framework under which the professions operate. Many health facilities, including nursing homes and other long-term care institutions, home care and community care organizations, medical laboratories, and diagnostic clinics are privately owned and administered. The majority are community-based not-for-profit organizations but some are private for-profit enterprises conducted on a commercial basis.

However, some (but not all) of these hospitals have recently been subsumed by new public arm's-length organizations known as regional health authorities (RHAs), which were established by the provinces beginning in the late 1980s. This change, commonly referred to as regionalization in Canada, involved the provincial governments carving up their respective territories into geographic regions and then creating RHAs to administer the delivery of a continuum of health services, from hospitals and nursing homes to home care and public health. As arm's-length public organizations established under provincial law, RHAs have a mandate to meet the health needs of the populations within their boundaries as both purchasers and providers of services. The type and extent of services purchased from independent facilities or professionals vary considerably among RHAs and among provinces. As can be seen in Table 1\n, the population size of RHAs varies considerably from province to province.",

A minority of provinces have instituted reference-based pricing policies, in which only the lower-cost therapeutic alternative is subsidized in full by the provincial drug plan. To manage the jurisdictional and policy overlaps in pharmaceutical regulation, the federal and provincial governments work through an intergovernmental body known as the Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health (CADTH). Conducting clinical- and cost-effectiveness studies under a Common Drug Review, CADTH makes formulary listing recommendations to all provincial governments with the exception of Quebec. Through the Canadian Optimal Medication Prescribing and Utilization Service, CADTH promotes evidence-based best practices in pharmaceutical prescribing and use. Finally, CADTH conducts a major health technology assessment program for a broad range of prescription drugs, medical devices, and other similar health technologies to assist all jurisdictions in decisions concerning the purchase of new health technologies on the basis of both clinical and cost-effectiveness.",

At the same time, a new Health Promotion Directorate within the federal Department funded and supervised cost-shared projects with citizen groups to pilot the new approach to health determinants. Although the projects at the local, regional, and national level initially focused on encouraging lifestyle changes, they eventually targeted larger societal and structural changes. This work had a profound impact on Health and Welfare Canada's Framework for Health Promotion as well as the major contributions of Canada to the World Health Organization's first international conference on health promotion and the release of the Ottawa Charter for Health Promotion, both of which appeared in 1986 (Epp 1986, Boyce 2002). Despite these advances, Canada's more traditional system of public health remained highly fragmented, poorly coordinated, and poorly funded by federal, provincial, and local governments. As a consequence, it did not fare well when faced with its first major crisis of the twenty-first century.",

Influenced by the coordinating function of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States, the Naylor Committee recommended the establishment of a national public health agency in Canada (Health Canada, 2003). The federal government established the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) in 2004.

Though not as dramatic, alcohol consumption has also fallen over the same period, again in part the result of attitudinal and behavioral changes. However, Canadians have been increasing their intake of calories, apparently the result of greater reliance on prepared foods from both supermarkets and restaurants, which tend to have higher fat content.

As a consequence, public confidence in the system was eroded although most Canadians remained committed to the solidarity principles underlying Medicare (Romanow, 2002).

In particular, the growth of private and public prescription drug plans has been in excess of double the rate in growth of hospital and physician expenditures. Despite this, most media and think tank commentators continue to focus on Medicare, occasionally suggesting alternatives to the current single-payer model of administration. These arguments were given considerable political support in a recent Supreme Court of Canada judgment. In the now famous Chaoulli case, the court concluded that the Quebec government's prohibition on private insurance for Medicare services violated the province's Charter of Rights in a situation in which a patient waits an unreasonable amount of time for elective surgery. While the decision is not likely to lead to private, multipayer insurance for Medicare services, it has fueled the ongoing debate concerning the appropriate divide between the public and the private sector in financing, administration, and delivery of health care in Canada.",
