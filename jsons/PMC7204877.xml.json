The main symptoms of URI are nasal stuffiness and discharge, sneezing, sore throat, and cough. The presence of low-grade fever is variable and more common in children than in adults. In spite of the benign nature of the illness, URIs cause a substantial economic burden on society in terms of medications, visits to physicians and other healthcare providers, and absenteeism. Young children suffer on average 6\u20138 and adults 2\u20134 URIs per year. The occurrence of URI displays a clear seasonal variation. The highest incidence rates are observed in the autumn and winter in temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. In tropical countries, most URIs occur during the rainy season.",

The highest incidence of AOM occurs in children between 6 months and 2 years of age. By the age of 2 years, approximately 70% of children have experienced at least one episode of AOM. In adults and the elderly, the most frequent complications of URI are paranasal sinusitis and pneumonia. Sinusitis has been estimated to occur as a complication in 0.5\u20132% of URIs. Recent studies have demonstrated, however, that paranasal sinuses are frequently affected during URI, and most sinus abnormalities are not evidence of a true bacterial complication but instead are part of the natural history of URI.",

Influenza A virus was the first virus to be isolated in 1933. Since then, intensive research into the etiology of URIs during the 1950s and 1960s led to the discovery of several other groups of respiratory viruses, for example, adenoviruses, rhinoviruses, parainfluenza viruses, respiratory syncytial viruses, enteroviruses, and coronaviruses. During the past few years, the application of molecular techniques to viral detection has resulted in the discovery of several respiratory viruses that had remained unknown before the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) era, for example, human metapneumovirus and new coronaviruses. Although the viral etiology of URIs can be currently documented in over 90% of cases by the use of modern diagnostic techniques, it is probable that a number of viruses causing respiratory illnesses still remain to be identified.",

The diagnosis may sometimes be delayed in infants and young children, especially when fever is the leading symptom during the early stage of the illness. The incubation period of URI varies considerably among different viruses, ranging from 12 h to 7 days. A typical illness starts with a sore throat that is shortly accompanied by nasal stuffiness, runny nose, sneezing, and cough. The soreness of the throat often disappears quickly, whereas the initial watery nasal discharge soon turns thicker and more purulent. Usually the severity of the symptoms increases rapidly and peaks within 2\u20133 days. The average duration of URI is 7\u201310 days, but in a number of patients some symptoms may still be present after 3 weeks.",

In clinical practice, earache is the only symptom that can be considered specific for AOM. However, the value of this symptom in suspecting AOM is severely limited by the fact that almost half of infants and young children with AOM either do not have earache or they cannot express it to their parents.

In the absence of sinus puncture, facial pain (especially if unilateral), maxillary toothache, postnasal drip, and nasal obstruction or thick nasal discharge for more than 7\u201310 days are usually thought to be indicative of bacterial sinusitis.

Other routes of transmission include small-particle aerosols lingering in the air and direct hit by large-particle aerosols from an infected person. The primary ways of transmission as well as the detailed pathogenetic mechanisms differ among various respiratory viruses. For example, the primary site of replication of influenza viruses is in the trachea, whereas rhinovirus replication starts predominantly in the nasopharynx.

About 90% of rhinovirus serotypes use intercellular adhesion molecule-1 as their receptor. Viral replication starts rapidly inside the cells, and progeny viruses can be detected within 10 h of viral inoculation. However, not all infections lead to clinical illness. Viral infection of the nasal mucosa results in vasodilation and increased vascular permeability, which, in turn, cause nasal obstruction and discharge that are the hallmark symptoms of URI. Cholinergic stimulation leads to increased mucous gland secretion and sneezing. There is increasing evidence that the clinical symptoms of the patient are primarily caused by the host's inflammatory response. Increased levels of several inflammatory mediators, for example, interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, IL-8, tumor necrosis factor, leukotrienes, kinins, histamine, and RANTES (regulated upon activation normally T-cell expressed and secreted), have been found in nasal secretions from patients with URI. It has been reported that the concentrations of IL-6 and IL-8 in nasal secretions correlate with the severity of symptoms. The host response mechanisms during respiratory viral infections are, however, very complicated, consisting of a network of factors affecting each other in a time-dependent manner, and it is probable that several essential factors still remain to be identified.",

Inflammatory mediators play a key role in disruption of normal eustachian tube function although certain viruses, for example, influenza viruses, can also cause direct damage to the epithelial cells in the eustachian tube. Dysfunction of the eustachian tube results in formation of underpressure in the middle-ear cavity, decreased drainage of middle-ear secretions into the nasopharynx, and loss of protection of the middle-ear from nasopharyngeal secretions. Eventually, these events lead to microbial invasion of the middle-ear, host inflammatory response in the middle-ear mucosa, and clinical signs and symptoms of AOM.",

Nasal stuffiness can be effectively reduced with intranasally or orally administered decongestants. First-generation (but not second-generation) antihistamines reduce sneezing and nasal discharge. This effect is probably more likely due to the anticholinergic rather than the antihistamine features of these drugs. Locally administered ipratropium has also been shown to reduce nasal discharge. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs reduce fever and soreness of the throat. Cough medications are commonly used but their efficacy has not been demonstrated convincingly. Despite corticosteroids being potent anti-inflammatory agents, their intranasal or oral use has not resulted in any clinical benefits. The use of intranasal steroids in children during rhinovirus infection may even increase the risk of AOM. Data on the efficacy of zinc, vitamin C, or echinacea extracts in the treatment of URI are inconclusive. Although it is well known that antibiotics are not effective against viruses and that unnecessary use of antibiotics increases bacterial resistance, antibiotics are frequently used in the treatment of uncomplicated URIs. Specific antiviral treatments for respiratory viruses are currently available only for influenza viruses (oseltamivir, zanamivir, amantadine, and rimantadine). However, antiviral drugs for some other respiratory viruses (e.g., RSV, rhinoviruses, enteroviruses) are currently being developed.",

Unfortunately, clinically useful indicators to help decide which patients would really benefit from antibiotics are not currently available.
