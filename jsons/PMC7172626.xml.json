            "text": "Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) is a member of Coronaviridae, which is the etiological agent of transmissible gastroenteritis. Although the virus is capable of infecting swine of all ages, suckling piglets are the most susceptible and have a mortality rate up to 100% [1]. TGEV is a pleomorphic enveloped virus containing a positive-stranded RNA genome and four structural proteins: the spike (S) protein, the integral membrane (M) protein, the minor envelope (E) protein, and the nucleocapsid (N) protein. Among which, the spike (s) protein, one of the key structural membrane proteins of coronaviruses, is an attractive target for generating neutralizing antibodies against the virus due to the critical role it plays in the host cell invasion [2], [3]. Precisely, the S protein mediates the attachment of virus particles to targets via binding of itself to the specific receptors. At the N terminus of the S protein, there are four antigenic sites, A, B, C, and D, which have been shown to be involved in the stimulation of neutralizing antibodies (Fig. 1\n) [4]. Previous studies have determined that the A site (which is fully dependent on glycosylation for proper folding) is predominantly responsible for stimulating neutralizing host antibodies [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10].",

Given that Poxvirus-vectors can prevent a great deal of important diseases in both humans and animals it is not surprising that many of these vectors been licensed and used extensively [11], [12], [13]. Additionally, SPV is a safe vaccine vector as there is no risk of cross-species infection[14]. Therefore, both for biological and clinical practicality, SPV is regarded as an appropriate and promising veterinary vaccine for swine, owing to its ability to effectively express foreign genes, its large packaging capacity for recombinant DNA, its low cost of delivery and its specific host restriction [15]. The potential value of SPV as a live vector vaccine is being studied extensively. Because SPV is able to pack large amounts of recombinant DNA and to induce appropriate immune responses in vivo, it is a promising candidate for the development of a recombinant vaccine [16], [17]. As of yet, pigs are the only known hosts of swinepox virus and therefore may be useful in developing a safe vaccine for clinical application [18], [19].",

After three PBST washes, horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-SPA IgG (1:10,000 diluted in PBST, Signalway Antibody) was added to each test well. The plates were then incubated at room temperature in the dark for 30 min and then washed three times with PBST. The TMB microwell peroxidase substrate system (TIANGEN) was used to develop the reaction. Samples were developed for 20 min and the reaction terminated with 2.0 M sulphuric acid.
