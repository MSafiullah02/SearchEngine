The protein and nucleotide sequences of ACE2 were initially compared across different species to identify key differences among them. The ACE2 receptor of various species was homology modelled and assessed for its binding ability to the spike receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2. Out of the several spike binding properties of ACE2, a significant difference between the known, infected and uninfected species was observed for Entropy side chain, Van der Waals, Solvation Polar, Solvation Hydrophobic and Interface Residues. However, these parameters did not specifically categorize the animals into infected or uninfected, for all the Orders (of animals). This clearly established the fact that no single parameter should be used to predict SARS-CoV-2 entry. The logistic regression model constructed led to inclusion of Interaction energy, entropy sidechain and entropy mainchain for estimating the probability of viral entry in different species. In the mammalian class, most of the species of Carnivores, Artiodactyls, Perissodactyls, Pholidota, and Primates showed high probability of viral entry. However, among the primates, baboons have very low probability of viral entry. Among rodents, hamsters were highly probable for viral entry with rats and mice having a very low probability. Rabbits have a medium probability of viral entry. In Birds, ducks have a very low probability, while chickens seemed to have medium probability and turkey showed the highest probability of viral entry.",

SARS and MERS, which emerged in 2003 and 2012 , respectively, caused a worldwide pandemic claiming 774 (8,000 SARS cases) and 866 (2,519 MERS cases) human lives, respectively(2020), while SADS devastated livestock production by causing fatal diseases in pigs in 2017. The SARS and MERS viruses had several common factors in having originated from bats in China and being pathogenic to human or livestock (Drosten, et al., 2003; Fan, et al., 2019; Zhou, et al., 2018) . Seventeen years after the first highly pathogenic human coronavirus, SARS-COV-2 is devastating the world with 4,560,457 cases and 304,309 deaths (as on May 15, 2020)(2020). This outbreak was first identified in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China, in December 2019 and notified by WHO on 5 th January 2020. The disease has since been named as COVID-19 by WHO.",

The four structural proteins and the ORF1a/ORF1b are relatively consistent among the CoVs, however, number and size of accessory proteins govern the length of the CoV genome (Fan, et al., 2019) . This genome expansion is said to have facilitated acquisition of genes that encode accessory proteins, which are beneficial for CoVs to adapt to a specific host (Forni, et al., 2017; Subissi, et al., 2014) .

            "text": "The protein and DNA sequence lengths of ACE2 varied in different hosts ( Table   1 ). Among the sequences that were compared, the longest CDS was found in the Order -Chiroptera (Myotis braditii -811 aa) and the smallest in the Order -Proboscidea (Loxodonta africana -800 aa). Homo sapiens ACE2 is taken as a standard to compare all the sequences because of the on-going pandemic nature of COVID-19 and the availability of its 3D structure -6LZG (Wang, et al., 2020) . The within group mean distance, the parameter indicative of variability of nucleotide sequences within the group was found to be minimum in Perrisodactyla followed by Primates and was maximum among the Galliformes followed by Chiroptera ( Table 2 ). This indicates that within the group of primates, all the considered species are prone to be equally infected with SARS-CoV-2 as humans. Further, to establish the probability of SARS-CoV-2 entry into species of other Orders, the distance of all orders from Primates was assessed (Table   3 ). This distance was found minimum for Perissodactyls followed by Carnivores and maximum for Galliformes followed by Anseriformes. This confirms with the recent reports of Chicken (Galliformes) and ducks (Anseriformes) not being infected with SARS-CoV-2 (Shi, et al., 2020) , and tigers and lions being infected(2020). To decide a cut-off distance that can establish whether the species can be infected or not, the individual distance of each species from Homo sapiens was evaluated (Supplementary Table 3 ). Melaegris gallapova (Turkey) is the species, which had the greatest distance from Homo sapiens. Recently, it was reported that SARS-CoV-2 does not infect pigs, chickens, ducks (Shi, et al., 2020) and rats (Zhang, et al., 2020) . The minimum distance that corresponds to the species that is already established to be uninfected with the SARS-CoV-2 would be 0.187 of Rattus norvegicus (Rat). Considering this distance from Homo sapiens as a cut-off, would include all the carnivores, perissodactyls and few artiodactyls viz. Goat, buffalo, Bison and sheep, to be infected and excludes cattle (Artiodactyla), all the bats (Chiroptera) and birds (Galliformes, Anseriformes and Accipitriformes). Similar distance values were observed on evaluating the protein sequences as well (Table-2 Galliformes, followed by Acciptriformes, Testidunes, Crocodilia and Chiroptera. The protein sequence alignment at 30-41aa, 82-84 aa and 353-357 also showed similar sequence conservation and variability (Figure 2) . The Codon-based Test of Neutrality to understand the selection pressure on the ACE2 sequence in the process of evolution was done. The analysis showed that there was a significant negative selection between and within orders for the ACE2 sequence indicating that, though, there is a variation at the nucleotide level, the protein translation had synonymous substitutions dominating over the non-synonymous substitutions. This negative selection indicates that the structure of ACE2 is being conserved through the process of evolution.",

The first cluster represented the Mammalian class and the second cluster was represented by two sub-clusters of Avian and Reptilian classes with high bootstrap values ( Figure   3 ). Within the mammalian cluster, the artiodactyls were sub-clustered farthest to the primates and the rodents, lagomorphs and carnivores were found clustered close to the primates with reliable bootstrap values. This partially corroborates with the occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in carnivores (Shi, et al., 2020) since rats were found uninfected with SARS-CoV-2 (Zhang, et al., 2020) .

This suggests that the virus probably could enter the fruit-bat as well, since it clustered with horseshoe bat to a common subnode. These results again leave us with no concrete conclusions on viral entry in various hosts. Therefore, to assess the probability of viral entry in various species, homology modeling of ACE2 along with its interaction with coronavirus spike receptorbinding domain was analyzed for all the 48 hosts.",

The models constructed were then studied for their interaction with the spike receptor binding domain defined in the same ID. It was observed that the modelled interaction of human ACE2 showed four hydrogen bonds between the ACE2 and Spike receptor binding domain. The hydrogen bonds between the ACE2 and Spike receptor binding domain varied for different species (Fig 4) . In FoldX, several parameters (spike binding properties of ACE2) were estimated for the binding of ACE2 with spike receptor binding domain. Logistic regression model was constructed on 17 species (known infected or uninfected) using these parameters. When each parameter was considered individually, significant difference between the infected and uninfected groups was observed for Entropy side chain, Van der Waals, Solvation Polar, Solvation Hydrophobic and Interface Residues (Supplementary Table 4 ). Each of the Order(s) was tested as a group for their possibility of infection by comparing them with the infected and uninfected groups for all these significant parameters (Figure 5, Figure 6 & Figure 7) . For the parameterssolvation hydrophobic and entropy side chain, artiodactyls were found significantly (P<0.05) different from the uninfected group and not significantly (P<0.05) different from the infected group ( Figure 5 ). This indicates that the artiodactyls considered in the study can be infected. The testudines were significantly different from the infected and not significantly different from the uninfected groups for all the parameters (Figure 6 ). This suggests that the species considered under testudines may not be infected.",

These results do not lead to meaningful conclusions on viral entry in different species, thereby, making it inevitable to depend on other parameters like evaluating the spike-interacting domain of ACE2. The spike interacting domain of the Homo sapiens ACE2 protein is defined in the UniProt ID Q9BYF1. The family and domains sections of the UniProt ID Q9BYF1 clearly marks the sequence location of the ACE2 -spike interacting domains as 30 -41aa, 82 -84 aa and 353 -357 aa. The nucleotide sequence alignments at positions that correspond to the spike-binding domain of Homo sapiens ACE2 are 90-123 bp; 244-252 bp and 1058-1071 bp. This spike interacting ACE2 domain sequences at the nucleotide level and protein level(Figure 1 and Figure 2) were compared and evaluated. The alignment shows that the sequence is well conserved within the Orders, suggesting that the structure defined by the sequence is conserved within the Orders.
