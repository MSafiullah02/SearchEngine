One month into the outbreak, many people were still not working or exercising as usual, which may have associated implications on health and wellbeing. Yet, the implications of the unusually prolonged state of not working and exercising on individuals\u2019 health and wellbeing remain unknown. It is important to understand not only the implications of the restrictions on COVID-19 disease prevalence rates but also the implications of such unprecedented disruptions on the health and wellbeing of the community (Brooks et al., 2020). From a policy perspective, understanding the health and wellbeing of people under the varying degrees of lockdown in China has implications for countries that are just starting to fight coronavirus, as such restrictions started in Korea, Italy, parts of the US, etc. in March (Moodie Davitt Report, 2020).",

The lockdown in Wuhan soon triggered similar measures in all 15 other cities in Hubei province with a total of 57 million people. Other prefectures (the administrative areas of a city) in China subsequently implemented varying levels of restrictive measures. For instance, the prefecture of Wenzhou in Zhejiang province restricted its citizens in such a way that only one person per household could leave home once every two days.",

However, those measures have disrupted people's jobs and lives immensely and hence may have important implications for their health and wellbeing (Lima et al., 2020). For example, evidence from the SARS crisis indicated that reduced mobility affected the wellbeing of quarantined residents in a complex manner. Cao et al., 2020 found students in their medical college in China experienced more stress and anxiety during the outbreak. A paper in BMJ designed a COVID-19 Peritraumatic Distress Index to assess the distress level of people during Covid-19 outbreak (Qiu et al., 2020). These papers are critical because across the world people who did not carry the virus epidemiologically but had their work and life disrupted to varying degrees (Duan and Zhu, 2020; Xiang et al., 2020; Bao et al., 2020). In this article, we aim to use existing scales of health, distress and life satisfaction to identify the health and wellbeing of people one month into the disruption caused by confinement measures to contain COVID-19 outbreak by their work status, chronic health conditions, and exercising hours.",

To cover people in areas of varying severity of COVID-19, we surveyed adults from 64 prefectures across China.

Maybe these people could better justify or rationalize their inactive lifestyles in more severely affected cities.

Because the measures of the dependent variables of SF12, distress and life satisfaction used Likert scales, we tried to use predictors that were non-Likert scales, such as job status and severity of COVID-19 calculated based on archival data using the reported locations. Second, our sample is not a national representative sample. Our focus was to examine the differential effects on adults depending on the level of disruption, as captured by their job status, existing chronic issues, and exercise levels to identify who in the community of non-COVID-19 cases might need the most help for policymakers and potential caregivers. Third, even though we had data from people who had not been working even before the outbreak started (8.7%) and people who went out of work during the outbreak (1.6%), the sample size of those two groups was small and we are cautious not to report them in the findings. Nevertheless, people with these two job statuses could be important targets for future studies.",

Affected regions are growing globally by the day, and COVID-19 is no longer confined to China (Cohen and Kupferschmidt, 2020). To contain COVID-19 transimission (Li et al., 2020), policymakers in other countries are considering implementing restrictive measures (Kupferschmidt and Cohen, 2020).
