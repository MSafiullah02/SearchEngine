            "text": "The first SARS case was reported in China's Guangdong Province in November of 2002. The total number of cases recorded in China climbed to over 5200 with about 5\u201310% mortality by the end of 2003. It has been confirmed that SARS is caused by a new coronavirus, but its epidemiology is little known (Dye and Gay, 2003, Lipsitch et al., 2003, Riley et al., 2003). Consequently, modelers are struggling to estimate the severity of the SARS epidemic, the effectiveness of control measures and to provide earlier warning of possible SARS outbreaks (Vogel, 2003). Mathematical models have been widely used to calculate and describe the dynamic evolution of epidemic threshold values and severity (Bailei, 1975, Anderson and May, 1992). The most widely used is the Kermarck-McKendrik model, also called the SIR model (Capasso and Serio, 1978), which is based on a system of three populations: susceptible, infectious and removals. Various epidemic models have been developed from the classic SIR model for different purposes, or with different assumptions, e.g. the SIRS model (Mollison, 1995), SEIR model (Keepling et al., 1997), two-level or two-stage SIR model (Ball and Neal, 2002), SIR models considering immunity (Greenhalgh et al., 2000), intermediate class (M\u00e9ndez and Fort, 2000), non-linearity of infection (Moghadas, 2002, Wendi and Zhien, 2002, Ruan and Wang, 2003), etc. In classic SIR models, the effective reproductive number, R, is the threshold parameter of epidemic diseases: if R\n < 1, the disease will eventually disappear, but R\n > 1 implies that the disease will persist (Hethcote and van den Driesssche, 1995, Wallinga et al., 1999, Diekmann et al., 1990). Therefore, knowledge of R is extremely valuable for developing epidemic management strategies as it gives some indication of the effort required to reach specific goals (Wendi and Zhien, 2002, Ruan and Wang, 2003). Recently, two studies reported the transmission epidemic of SARS in Singapore and Hong Kong (Dye and Gay, 2003, Lipsitch et al., 2003, Riley et al., 2003). Both estimated the basic reproduction number R\n0 is order of 2\u20134. Both teams make use of mathematical models based on a system of four subpopulations: susceptible, exposed, infectious, and recovered (immune) individual, also called a SEIR model.",

The infectious period of non-hospitalized patients, T\n1(t), is defined as the time non-hospitalized SARS persons from being infectious to being removed to hospitals. We assume that non-hospitalized SARS persons are infectious at the rate P\n1(t). Infected people with symptoms, once detected, are removed immediately to hospital for isolation and treatment. These infected patients further infect doctors, nurses and other front-line hospital staff at the rate P\n2(t) during the treatment period T\n2(t) in hospitals. Non-hospitalized SARS individuals are composed of two sub-groups: front-line hospital staff (doctors, nurses, etc.), N\n2d(t), and the general public, N\n2n(t). Non-hospitalized SARS people, N\n2(t), infect the general public, N\n2n(t), at the rate P\n1(t), while hospitalized SARS patients, N\n3(t), infect front-line hospital staff, N\n2d(t), at the rate P\n2(t). The transfer rates from N\n2(t) to N\n3(t) is determined by T\n1(t), and the transfer rate from N\n3(t) to N\n4(t) or N\n5(t) are determined by the proportion of cured patients, P\n3(t), and T\n2(t). The proportion of mortality due to SARS infection is 1 \u2212 \nP\n3(t). This model is especially designed for estimating the basic and effective reproductive number of the SARS virus from the data that has been released daily by the Chinese Ministry of Health (CMH) since April 21, 2003.",

Kramer (1994) accurately simulated the growth of an HIV infected population. Some other methods are also proposed to estimate model parameters, like the Martingale method (Fine and Clarkson, 1982, Yip, 1989, Becker, 1989, Becker, 1993, Haydon et al., 1997, Becker and Britton, 1999), Markov Chain Monte Carlo method (O\u2019Neill, 2002).

The model has the advantage that its parameters are easy to estimate from the data released by the CHM.

            "text": "Our model also includes three basic components: susceptible (N\n1), infectious (N\n2, N\n3) and removals (N\n4, N\n5). Thus, it is basically a SIR model used widely in epidemiological studies (e.g. Capasso and Serio, 1978, Mollison, 1995, Keepling et al., 1997, Ball and Neal, 2002, Greenhalgh et al., 2000, Dye and Gay, 2003, Lipsitch et al., 2003, Riley et al., 2003). The difference of our model from the classic SIR model is that we further divide the infectious component into two parts: hospitalized and non-hospitalized populations, and we divide the removal component into two parts: cured and dead populations. These modifications were specially done for SARS transmissions. The other difference is that we define the infectious rate differently. Let S(t) is the number of susceptible population at time t, I(t) is the number of infectious population at time t, \u03b1 is the maximum infection rate, \u03c4 is the incubation time. In the classic SIR model (e.g. Monteriro et al., 2006a, Monteriro et al., 2006b), the contribution of I(t) to the increase of newly infection population is calculated as: \u0394\n = \n\u03b1\u00b7S(t)\u00b7I(t\n \u2212 \n\u03c4). In our model, we define P(t) as the infection rate of infectious individual of I(t) at time t. Thus, we have the following equation: \u0394\n = \nP(t)\u00b7I(t). The parameter P(t) varies in time. It contains the combined effect of incubation time, immunity and control efforts. In the classic SIR model, \u03b1 is assumed to be constant, only S(t) and I(t\n \u2212 \n\u03c4) determine the increase of newly infected population. In fact, isolation measures by human obviously affect the infection rate \u03b1. Such an effect is not well presented in the classic SIR model.",

One of the key preventative measures in China is the complete isolation of those confirmed or suspected of having been infected, including anyone likely to have had close contact with confirmed or suspected SARS carriers. This measure is strongly recommended because the model shows that both the infectious period (T\n1) and the infection rate (P\n1) are very sensitive parameters. In addition to isolating confirmed cases reducing the infectious period (T\n1) is an effective means of reducing SARS infection.
