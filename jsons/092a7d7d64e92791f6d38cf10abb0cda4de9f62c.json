Since then, the virus has swept across the globe causing millions of confirmed infections and hundreds of thousands of deaths. To better understand the nature of the pandemic and the introduction and spread of the virus in Arizona, we sequenced viral genomes from clinical samples tested at the TGen North Clinical Laboratory, provided to us by the Arizona Department of Health Services, and at Arizona State University and the University of Arizona, collected as part of community surveillance projects. Phylogenetic analysis of 79 genomes we generated from across Arizona revealed a minimum of 9 distinct introductions throughout February and March. We show that >80% of our sequences descend from clades that were initially circulating widely in Europe but have since dominated the outbreak in the United States. In addition, we show that the first reported case of community transmission in Arizona descended from the Washington state outbreak that was discovered in late February. Notably, none of the observed transmission clusters are epidemiologically linked to the original travel-related cases in the state, suggesting successful early isolation and quarantine. Finally, we use molecular clock analyses to demonstrate a lack of identifiable, widespread cryptic transmission in Arizona prior to the middle of February 2020.",

Viral genome sequencing has emerged as a key tool for addressing these questions. In order to assist with both local and global efforts to track the spread and evolution of this virus, we began intensive sequencing of viral genomes from across Arizona and deposition of these sequences in the GISAID database, which makes them accessible to the research community for downstream analyses, notably including real-time pathogen tracking through Nextstrain 12 .",

First, although it appeared from epidemiological data that the first case of COVID-19 in Arizona did not lead to any additional cases, did cryptic transmission occur, similar to that proposed to have begun with WA1, the first diagnosed COVID-19 patient in the U.S., who arrived in Washington state from Wuhan, China on January 15th, 2020 13 ?

This represents a sequencing effort of 4.9% of all reported cases in Arizona as of April 2nd. This dataset includes at least one genome from 11 of the 15 Arizona counties (Supplementary Table 3) . Aside from AZ1, 3 SARS-CoV-2 genomes from Arizona were sequenced by the CDC, which we do not include in any analyses. Initial Arizona case did not lead to sustained local transmission The first case of COVID-19 in Arizona (AZ1) was documented in late January 2020, and contact tracing suggested this initial case did not result in additional symptomatic infections within the state 5 . We sought to independently verify this conclusion using Bayesian and maximum likelihood phylogenetic analyses to compare our 79 genomes to a representative subset of the SARS-CoV-2 genomes generated from around the world. The genomes used in this analysis were selected using a novel bioinformatics pipeline (see Methods), which subsampled genomes uploaded to GISAID to reduce the size of the dataset while representing temporal, spatial, and genetic diversity of the full dataset. This resulted in a set of 384 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences, including our 79 Arizona genomes and 305 additional representatives (Supplementary Table 1) . A reduced version of this dataset, including 372 genomes with complete dating information, was used in the Bayesian analysis.",

These lineages were not unique to AZ; they have all been documented in other parts of the USA, as well as in multiple countries around the world ( Figure 3, Supplementary Figure 2 ). In fact, the geographic ubiquity of the major SARS-CoV-2 lineages, along with the common observation of identical virus genomes sampled in multiple US states, countries and continents, clearly demonstrates how frequently this virus has been moved between locales. Given the timing and size of the AZ outbreak, relative to outbreaks in other locations (Figure 3 ), we argue it is unlikely that any of these named lineages arose within Arizona.

However, we view this as the most extreme estimate because many of these lineages likely represent multiple distinct introductions to Arizona, rather than a single introduction followed by sustained community transmission. For example, B.1, the inferred oldest lineage containing Arizona genomes, includes multiple well-supported clades (posterior probability \u2265 0.99, bootstrap \u226565), all of which have also been observed in several other US states and countries (Supplementary Figure 1) .

For this analysis, we considered the full collection of SARS-CoV-2 genomes available on GISAID (as of 4/16/2020). First, for each of the 5 major lineages, Arizona sequences were always sampled after a sequence from that same lineage or sublineage had been sampled elsewhere. Although sequencing efforts can influence this result, it appears unlikely that any of the major lineages emerged in Arizona; rather, they were likely imported. Second, there are very few sequences from Asia clustered within each of the 5 major lineages. Instead, it appears importation was largely driven by domestic travel (in the case of A.1, B.1.2, B.1.29), or perhaps imported from Europe (B.1) or Oceania (A.3), although both of these latter lineages have also been commonly observed elsewhere in the US.

If these six Arizona genomes stem from a single introduction of the A.1 lineage, this tMRCA estimate suggests the lineage was already present in Arizona prior to when community transmission was announced in Washington, on Feb. 28th ( Figure 2 ).

Based on viral RNA quantifications and phylogenetic analyses 20 , it was recently suggested that this substitution may have increased the transmissibility of the virus. Although the outbreak in Arizona was already dominated by B.1 lineage viruses in early March 2020, we did see a gradual increase in the relative proportion of B.1 throughout March and into early April ( Figure 4A ). We also compared qRT-PCR cycle threshold (Ct) values for clinical samples with and without this substitution. Our results show a similar trend to that reported from patients in Sheffield, England 20 , with a lower mean Ct (higher viral load) in samples containing the D614G substitution; however, this is not a statistically significant difference (p=0.85) with our current sample size ( Figure 4B ). Combined, these data, along with those published by other groups 20 ( https://github.com/blab/ncov-D614G ), are consistent with a replication and/or transmission advantage of viruses containing the D614G substitution. However, experimental studies are needed to validate this hypothesis. An alternative explanation is that the B.1 lineage has simply been increasing in frequency globally, due to chance events that led this lineage to dominate in early outbreaks (e.g., in Italy), from which the virus has been spread widely throughout the world and has seeded outbreaks in many other locations.",

Based on ancestral state reconstructions, this lineage is predicted to have first emerged in Asia and/or Europe (Nextstrain), and this lineage was observed in multiple European countries, including the large Italian outbreak, before it was first documented in New York (Nextstrain). In fact, just within Arizona, we have documented at least two instances in which B.1 lineage viruses were imported directly to the US from Europe. The second case of COVID-19 in Arizona was reported on March 3rd, from a traveler who returned from France on Feb. 27th 22 . This individual self-reported being symptomatic on the plane back to Phoenix, and went to multiple social gatherings before being officially diagnosed 23 . At one of these social events, at least one other individual was infected 24 . Although we did not sequence the SARS-CoV-2 genome from this individual, CDC deposited this sequence into GISAID ( EPI_ISL_420784 ) , and we confirmed it belonged to the B.1 lineage (data not shown). We also have records shared to us by the Coconino Health and Human Service Department that one of the B.1 genomes we sequenced from Coconino County came from an individual who had recently traveled to Rome, Italy, and who presumably got infected there. Thus, although it is tempting to speculate that most of the B.1 infections across the US came from the NY outbreak, we show at least two confirmed instances of direct importation of B.1 into Arizona from Europe.",

A similar truncation is present in the SARS-CoV genome due to the presence of an upstream stop codon.

We estimate a minimum of 9 over the course of February and March. By estimating the timing of introductions, we find no evidence for cryptic community transmission in Arizona prior to late January. Rather, our analyses indicate that community transmission likely did not occur within Arizona until at least early-to mid-February when viruses from lineages B.1 and A.1 may have been introduced. It appears that most of the introductions of SARS-CoV-2 to Arizona have had domestic origins, in line with reports from other states 16 ; however, there have also been instances of Arizona cases linked to international travel, and these have likely also contributed to the local outbreak. A number of non-synonymous mutations were identified in the Arizona isolates, including within regions of the receptor-binding domain of the spike protein and non-structural proteins involved in the RNA synthesis complex. The functional consequences of these mutations are unknown, highlighting the need for mechanistic studies. Our phylodynamic tracing provides unique epidemiological insights into the origins and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in Arizona.",
