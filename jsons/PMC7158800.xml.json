Many specialties (intensive care, pneumology, virology, infectious diseases, geriatrics) are focusing on saving as many infected patients as possible or keeping patients as comfortable as possible. Surgeons are, with variations among countries, asked to prioritise their access to anaesthesia and the operating room, as nurses and anaesthetists are required for the care of infected patients. In addition, the ventilators in operating theatres and even the theatre space itself are being used for care of the critically ill.",

            "text": "Urology is a specialty that deals with both urgent and non-urgent cases. It did not take long before urologists published guidance on which types of surgery for adult patients need to be prioritised [5]. However, compared to adult urology, paediatric urology has wide variations in practice and involves paediatric urologists and paediatric surgeons, with large disparities worldwide. Moreover, prioritisation may be more difficult: while there is no doubt that a child with sepsis due to an obstructing stone requires urinary drainage or a testicular torsion needs exploration, oncology is an infrequent problem compared to adult urology. Most paediatric urology surgeries involve congenital anomalies, with indications focused as much on preventing morbidity (urinary tract infections [UTIs]) as on a long-term perspective of preventing renal function loss and assuring normal genital cosmesis and function. One might wonder how urgent surgery is for a congenital malformation. Life-threatening malformations, such as in the heart or lung, are considered urgent without any doubt, but how urgent is repair of hypospadias or bladder exstrophy? As we have to expect major limitations in access to surgical capacity over the coming months, the variety of surgical indications that need to be considered for prioritisation includes obstructive uropathy and recurrent febrile UTIs putting children at intermediate-term risk of loss of renal function. However, it is nearly impossible to translate these issues to a definitive recommendation of how long such interventions could be postponed, as the dynamics of renal function loss depend on many variables that are mostly impossible to predict [6]. It is likely that a timeframe of 6\u201312 wk might be relevant for severe obstruction, but for UTI-associated renal function loss such a timeframe is harder to quantify.",

The truth is probably slightly different: without any possibility to do otherwise, we accept the need and delay surgery. We try to balance the risk of surgery with the risk of virus transmission to the child or others either en route to or within the hospital, or the risk of mobilising resources away from acutely ill patients. As we do not know how long this pandemic will last, we actually do not know how long we might have to postpone \u201cnon-urgent\u201d procedures. Just a few weeks? A few months? Until it becomes really urgent? Frankly, nobody knows. Postponing cryptorchidism surgery for a few months might not be a problem, but for every 6 mo of delay the risk of needing assisted reproductive technologies rises by 5% and the risk of later malignancy by 6% [7]. But what if we still have to \u201cprioritise\u201d in a few months to deal with the backlog due to the pandemic, or even worse, if the pandemic is still raging? What if \u201clockdowns\u201d are enforced repeatedly? At some point we will have to manage and to cope with accumulating waiting lists.",
