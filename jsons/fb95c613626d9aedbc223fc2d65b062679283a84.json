Previous pandemics have also attracted global attraction 1 . There is invariably a nationwide response at the time of crisis, but the efforts wane off soon after the pandemic. Political commitments shift towards other emerging issues of national and global importance. Restoration of economic activities assumes priority. Lessons learnt from the pandemics are quickly forgotten. Funds earmarked to strengthen pandemic preparedness plans are reduced or diverted. Health system remains weak, at times getting weaker because of the impact of the pandemic and continues to be inadequately equipped to combat next such event.",

In the absence of serious efforts to preserve the environment and wildlife ecology, it is impossible to prevent the emergence of these novel pathogens from animals, a few of which will have the capacity to jump species and become swiftly transmissible among humans. This can ignite epidemics with potential to explode into pandemics. Maintaining a state of perpetual pandemic preparedness is not an option, rather a necessity for the global community to mitigate mortality and morbidity. This will prevent economies sliding back by decades and loss of lives and will minimize the ensuing disruptive social chaos.",
