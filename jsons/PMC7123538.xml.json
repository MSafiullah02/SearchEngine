            "text": "Plasma is the acellular fraction of blood, separated from the cellular blood components either by centrifugation of citrated whole blood or donor apheresis, with typical unit volumes averaging from 200 to 300 mL. There are several types of plasma products used for supplementation or replacement of soluble coagulation factors. The most widely recognized plasma component is fresh frozen plasma (FFP), which requires freezing at \u221218 \u00b0C within 6\u20138 h of collection (AABB 2013a). Plasma frozen within 24 h after phlebotomy (FP24) is similar to FFP in its preparation but differs in that it may be frozen at or below \u221218 C within 24 h after collection. Frozen plasma products prepared for transfusion requires thawing and warming to between 30 and 37 C. This takes 20\u201330 min, depending upon the equipment used for thawing and the unit volume. If the prepared plasma is not transfused within the initial 24-h post-thaw period, it can be relabeled as \u201cthawed plasma\u201d for use within 5 days after the initial thaw (AABB 2013a; Benjamin and McLaughlin 2012; Eder and Sebok 2007). The utility of thawed plasma is twofold: (1) it provides rapidly available plasma for the management of massive hemorrhage, and (2) it extends available plasma inventory by avoiding wastage of plasma suitable for transfusion (Downes et al. 2001). One rarely used plasma product, available in the USA, is liquid plasma. Unlike the previously described plasma products, liquid plasma has never been frozen; it is separated from a whole blood unit no later than 5 days before its expiration date and has a shelf life of 26 days from the date of the source blood collection (40 days if CPDA-1 is used as the anticoagulant for the parent component) (AABB 2013a; Benjamin and McLaughlin 2012).",

Solvent/detergent-treated plasma (S/D plasma) is one of the most frequently used pathogen-reduced plasma products. Pooled plasma composed of a given ABO type undergoes viral inactivation with solvents (i.e., 1 % tri(n-butyl) phosphate) and detergents (i.e., 1 % Triton-X 100), which are subsequently extracted by oil and affinity ligand chromatography for selective binding of prion proteins (PrPSc). This treatment significantly inactivates lipid-enveloped viruses such as HIV and Hepatitis C as well as cellular pathogens such as bacteria and protozoa. While the pathogen inactivation process is ineffective against non-lipid-enveloped viruses such as hepatitis A (HAV) and parvovirus B19, product specifications identify minimum levels of B19 and hepatitis E virus (HEV) genetic material permissible, as well as minimum levels of neutralizing antibodies directed against HAV and B19 (Benjamin and McLaughlin 2012). This product had not been approved for use in the USA until January 2013, when the FDA approved Octaplas\n\u00ae (Octapharma, Austria) for transfusion (FDA 2013; Riedler et al. 2003; Ozier et al. 2011; Sachs et al. 2005; Sinnott et al. 2004).",

Group AB plasma, which lacks antibodies directed against A and B antigens, is compatible with all blood types and is used as emergency release plasma when there is insufficient time for determining the recipient\u2019s blood type (Wehrli et al. 2009). The Rh (D) type is not always matched because immunization to Rh (D) antigen has rarely been reported as a result of transfusion of Rh (D)-positive plasma to Rh (D)-negative individuals. Hemolytic reactions as a consequence of infusion of an undetected antibody directed toward recipient RBC antigens are rarely seen, as is alloimmunization to RBC antigens (Ching et al. 1991).\n",

Many guidelines recommend using the international normalized ratio (INR) at or greater than 1.5 as an indication for plasma transfusion (O\u2019Shaughnessy et al. 2004). However, a consensus on laboratory value \u201ctriggers\u201d for plasma transfusion has not been reached. For massive hemorrhage, empiric transfusion of plasma in set ratios to RBC units is widely practiced in the USA (Holcomb et al. 2013; Dzik et al. 2011). Retrospective and observational studies on massive transfusion in military and civilian trauma have reported associations between higher plasma/RBC transfusion ratios and improved survival (Holcomb et al. 2013; Borgman et al. 2007; Shaz and Hillyer 2010), although definitive data on optimal use of plasma in this setting has yet to emerge (Holcomb et al. 2013).",

Additional indications include rapid warfarin reversal in an actively bleeding patient, although guidelines are emerging preferentially recommending prothrombin complex concentrates as a first-line agent (Ageno et al. 2012; Keeling et al. 2011; Morgenstern et al. 2010; Ansell et al. 2008). Plasma is not appropriate to use as a nutritional supplement or as a source of immunoglobulin and should not be used as a volume expander when blood volume can safely and adequately be replaced with other agents such as colloids (AABB 2013).",

            "text": "In a nonpregnant individual, 1 mL of plasma contains approximately 1 unit of coagulation factor activity. Nonpathogen-reduced plasma products contain slightly less than 1 U/mL clotting factors due to approximately 10 % dilution from anticoagulant solution and naturally occurring variability in factor levels between individual donors (Benjamin and McLaughlin 2012; Eder and Sebok 2007). Administration of a 10\u201320 mL/kg dose of plasma typically increases circulating coagulation factor levels by 20\u201330 % (Spector et al. 1966). Standardization of clotting factors in S/D plasma manufacturing allows for more precise dosing; a dose of 12\u201315 mL/kg should raise most coagulation factors levels by up to 25 %. Plasma doses exceeding 15 mL/kg present increasing risks for volume overload in the recipient unless given in context of ongoing blood loss or therapeutic plasmapheresis (Murad et al. 2010; Popovsky 2004). Standard dosing protocols are appropriate for FFP and FP24, as well as for liquid plasma as these three products are considered essentially hemostatically equivalent for almost all clotting factors except for FV and FVIII\u2014despite slight variations between clotting factors existing between these products (Benjamin and McLaughlin 2012; Eder and Sebok 2007; Downes et al. 2001; Sidhu et al. 2006; Yazer et al. 2008, 2010; Gosselin et al. 2013) (see Table 10.2). The process of solvent detergent treating of plasma also results in a decrease in FV and FVIII (Buchta et al. 2004). While remaining within regulatory requirements, declines in procoagulant levels may be clinically significant and require patient monitoring (Benjamin and McLaughlin 2012; Buchta et al. 2004).\n",

In the early 2000s, reports of thrombotic adverse events and increased fibrinolysis after the use of S/D plasma prompted withdrawal of the product from the US markets (Flamholz et al. 2000; de Jonge et al. 2002). Currently, the manufacturer of FDA-approved Octaplas\u00ae claims to have all coagulation factors within their known references ranges and the same hemostatic activity as FFP (Heger et al. 2006). The only exception is the inhibitor \u03b1-2 antiplasmin, which is below the cited reference range. Protein S levels are lower in S/D plasma as compared with FFP; as such, the use of S/D plasma is not recommended for use in patients with severe protein S deficiency (Theusinger et al. 2011).",

            "text": "Cryoprecipitate was originally developed as a FVIII concentrate for the treatment of hemophilia A, but the availability of safer, purified, or recombinant FVIII concentrates has largely supplanted its use in these patients. The primary indication for cryoprecipitate in modern transfusion practice is as a fibrinogen concentrate (Callum et al. 2009). Cryoprecipitate is the most frequently used fibrinogen concentrate in the USA and is the only one approved for use in the USA for treatment of acquired fibrinogen deficiency such as surgical blood loss, trauma, or postpartum hemorrhage. Pasteurized fibrinogen concentrates are increasingly replacing cryoprecipitate for treatment of both congenital and acquired fibrinogen deficiencies (Franchini and Lippi 2012; Kozek-Langenecker et al. 2013; Wikkelso et al. 2013). In the USA, each unit of cryoprecipitate is expected to contain >80 IU FVIII and >150 mg fibrinogen, with typical adult doses ranging from 6 to 10 pooled units. The following formula is recommended for calculating cryoprecipitate dosage: body weight (in kg) \u00d7 0.2 = number of cryoprecipitate units to raise fibrinogen by 50\u2013100 mg/dL (AABB 2013a). Therapeutic recovery of transfused fibrinogen from cryoprecipitate may be reduced by consumption in ongoing hemorrhage or fibrinolysis. A recent retrospective review of plasma fibrinogen increments following cryoprecipitate transfusion in the setting of trauma found a mean increase of 55 mg/dL after an average transfusion of 8.7 units (\u00b11.7) (Stanworth 2007). Cryoprecipitate remains a second-line therapy for von Willebrand disease and hemophilia A, as well as bleeding secondary to uremia (Hedges et al. 2007). Additionally, the 2013 European Society for Anaesthesia perioperative bleeding guidelines suggest that the use of cryoprecipitate for the treatment of hypofibrinogenemia is indicated if fibrinogen concentrates are not available (Kozek-Langenecker et al. 2013).",

In addition, they contribute key protein and molecular elements for fibrin clot formation as well as exerting a contractile force that draws together the margins of injury. Platelet concentrates are obtained either from whole blood or by collection from donors via apheresis. Platelet concentrates derived from a single 450\u2013500 mL whole blood collection contain greater than 5.5 \u00d7 1010 platelets per unit, with a typical adult dose formed by pooling 4\u20136 concentrates (AABB 2013a). Apheresis platelets contain over 3 \u00d7 1011 platelets per unit, and contrary to other platelet concentrates, they have the advantage that they represent only a single donor exposure per transfusion, reducing the risk of transfusion-transmitted infections. While some in vitro differences have been observed between platelets derived from the different collection methods (Vasconcelos et al. 2003), these have little clinical consequence, and these products are interchangeable (Slichter 2007; Chambers and Herman 1999).",

Platelets also have the shortest shelf life of any transfused product: the time from collection to expiration is 5 days; attempts to extend the approved storage time have failed (Dumont et al. 2010). This is due in part to the relatively short functional life of platelets (7\u201310 days in the circulation) but also to the risks of bacterial proliferation due to storage at room temperature (Palavecino et al. 2010).",

The highest risk ABO-incompatible platelet transfusions are those from group O single donor products administered to group A or B recipients, due to the tendency of group O individuals to form high titer anti-A and anti-B antibodies (Chambers and Herman 1999).

Symptoms occurred after 17\u201342 % of contaminated platelet transfusions, with a 17 % mortality rate (Kleinman et al. 2003; Brecher and Hay 2005). The incidence of severe septic episodes has not been clearly established but is probably approximately 200/million platelet units transfused (50 % sensitivity) (Blajchman and Goldman 2001; Walker 1987). Given the 5-day storage life and the persistent risk of platelet shortage, in September 2005, the FDA trialed the use of 7-day apheresis platelets under the surveillance program PASSPORT to determine the safety of extending the storage life. The study was discontinued early after 2 true-positive cultures were detected in 2,571 day 8 platelets (778/million) (Dumont et al. 2010). However, based on risk modeling, overall recipient risk may not have been improved by the reduced inventory caused by withdrawal of 7-day apheresis platelets. From an inventory management standpoint, platelet pools would have replaced them, potentially increasing infection risk and delaying a TRALI risk reduction strategy (Kleinman et al. 2009). Pathogen reduction strategies may further renew enthusiasm for 7-day storage.",

These reactions result from RBC lysis or accelerated clearance by the reticuloendothelial system resulting from RBC transfusion into a recipient with preformed antibodies directed against donor erythrocytes. Rarely, plasma-rich blood products have been implicated in hemolytic reactions by passive transfer of antibodies directed against recipient erythrocytes (Fung et al. 2007). Antibodies directed against ABO antigens are the most frequent source of incompatibility (Ching et al. 1991; Josephson et al. 2010), for example, transfusion of O platelets containing anti-A and anti-B. Pre-transfusion plasma reduction and ABO matching easily avoid this complication.",

Patients may also experience chills, rigors, nausea, and vomiting. Occasionally patients will manifest such signs and symptoms in the absence of fever. FNHTRs are caused by pyrogenic cytokines, such as IL-1, Il-6, or TNF-\u03b1, which accumulate in blood products during storage. The onset of symptoms usually occurs during transfusion but may present toward the end of the transfusion process or even within 1\u20132 h afterward due to the increasing level of cytokine exposure. The diagnosis of FNHTR is one of exclusion, having ruled out other causes of febrile reactions such as hemolytic transfusion reactions, septic reactions, or contributions from comorbidities or medications. Treatment is supportive, including antipyretics such as acetaminophen (Heddle 2007).",

Clinical presentation varies, but most manifests solely with cutaneous symptoms such as urticaria, pruritus, erythema, and angioedema (Domen and Hoeltge 2003). These minor allergic reactions are thought to be most often mediated by preexisting recipient IgE or IgG targeting plasma protein antigens. Passive transfer of IgE directed against recipient plasma allergens or other environmental allergens has also been observed. Accordingly, allergic reactions occur most frequently with plasma-rich products (including platelets) but may also occur in plasma-deplete products such as red cell units. Antihistamines such as diphenhydramine or famotidine form the cornerstone for treatment of minor allergic transfusion reactions with corticosteroids reserved for more severe reactions.",

Causative agents vary widely from anti-haptoglobin antibodies to passive transfer of allergens to which a patient is already sensitized, such as recently ingested foods (i.e., peanuts) (Jacobs et al. 2011). Ultimately, anaphylaxis is an unpredictable and potentially fatal transfusion outcome requiring swift action to prevent an adverse outcome. Severe allergic reactions or anaphylaxis should be managed in a similar fashion to anaphylaxis from other causes, with administration of epinephrine (with or without other vasopressors as needed) and corticosteroids, maintenance of a patent airway, and volume infusion to maintain hemodynamic stability. Testing for associated DIC and postponing procedures requiring further transfusion should also be considered.",

Clinical findings defining TRALI include (1) onset during or within 6 hours of transfusion; (2) severe hypoxemia, such as less than 90 % oxygen saturation on room air; (3) diffuse bilateral pulmonary infiltrates on chest x-ray; (4) absence of volume overload; and (5) no preexisting acute lung injury (Kleinman et al. 2004). TRALI may also be associated with fever, chills, hypotension, and transient leukopenia. The primary pathophysiologic mechanism is believed to be a reaction between donor anti-leukocyte antibodies and recipient leukocytes, which results in leukocyte activation (Marques et al. 2005), sequestration, and infiltration into the pulmonary capillary bed (Fung and Silliman 2009). Leukocyte activation results in pulmonary microvascular injury and capillary leakage with an influx of proteinaceous fluid into the alveolar space (Bux and Sachs 2007). A \u201ctwo-hit\u201d hypothesis for the pathogenesis of TRALI holds that the first hit is due to recipient neutrophils primed for activation by virtue of the patient\u2019s underlying clinical condition. The second hit involves activation of these neutrophils by anti-leukocyte antibodies or biological response modifiers contained in the transfused product (Silliman 2006). In rare cases, the transfused product may provide both hits (Kelher et al. 2009).",

Although cognate leukocyte antibody-antigen matches are often seen in TRALI cases, their absence does not rule out TRALI (Kopko et al. 2003; Stafford-Smith et al. 2010). Careful patient evaluation of suspected TRALI should involve both the clinical team and the transfusion service and include posttransfusion chest x-rays, measures of oxygenation, and evaluation for volume overload. Once TRALI is suspected, the transfusion must be immediately discontinued and the blood bank informed (Su and Kamel 2007). The details of the transfusion workup are beyond the scope of this chapter. Briefly, following all cases of TRALI and some cases of possible TRALI, the blood bank and the blood collection facility should investigate all donors associated with TRALI or possible TRALI cases for the presence of antihuman leukocyte antigen (HLA) and possibly antihuman neutrophil antigen (HNA) antibodies (Reil et al. 2008). Few laboratories (mostly in Europe) also perform leukocyte cross-matching as part of the evaluation. The extent of these investigations varies depending upon the availability of donor samples (usually not a problem), the availability of neutrophil antibody testing, and the availability of a recipient sample for HLA antigen typing (Kopko et al. 2001, 2003). A donor with HLA antibodies matching an affected recipient is classified as an implicated donor and is deferred from future plasma apheresis or platelet apheresis donation. If a donor has the highly morbid anti-HNA 3a antibodies, most blood banks will defer the donor from any type of blood donation (Davoren et al. 2003).",

            "text": "It has been well established that donors implicated in TRALI cases are more likely to be female and multiparous (Toy et al. 2012; Gajic et al. 2007b). While not all studies support the benefit of avoiding female plasma (Welsby et al. 2010), the overwhelming evidence supports the implementation of gender-based policies for reducing TRALI incidence from plasma transfusion. These factors resulted in the implementation of a new TRALI risk mitigation policy during the mid- to late 2000s throughout most of Europe and the USA, in which plasma units were predominantly obtained from male donors, thereby avoiding the transfusion of plasma units from female donors. This policy is feasible for plasma transfusion because the number of plasma units collected from whole blood or apheresis collections meets, or is in excess of, demand. In contrast, this policy is challenging for group AB platelet and plasma components (Reesink et al. 2012), where restriction of units to male donors jeopardizes supply (see Table 10.3). Despite that, in 2013 the AABB announced new TRALI risk mitigation standards requiring high-plasma volume components come from males, females who have not been pregnant, or females who have been tested since their most recent pregnancy to rule out the presence of anti-HLA antibodies, regardless of ABO group. These new standards are to go into effect in 2014 (AABB 2013b).\n",

Generally, TRALI is more likely to be associated with fever, hypotension, and exudative pulmonary infiltrates and less likely to respond to diuresis, whereas TACO is more likely to be associated with volume overload (e.g., positive fluid balance, elevated jugular venous pressure) or poor cardiac function (e.g., history of congestive heart failure, reduced left ventricular ejection fraction, or diastolic dysfunction). Similarly, elevated systolic blood pressures near the time of dyspnea onset, cardiomegaly, and/or increased circulating levels of brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) or N-terminal (NT)-pro-BNP support a diagnosis of TACO rather than TRALI (Popovsky 2009; Zhou et al. 2005; Tobian et al. 2008; Li et al. 2009; Rice et al. 2011; Ely et al. 2001).",

Whereas citrate is easily cleared during nonurgent transfusions, citrate load during massive transfusion may overwhelm this clearance mechanism (Sihler and Napolitano 2010). In the awake patient, hypocalcemia presents initially with chills, tingling, dizziness, and tetany; continued progression of citrate toxicity can lead to prolonged QT interval, decreased left ventricular function, and cardiac arrhythmias. While hypocalcemia can be managed by slowing the rate of transfusion, in ongoing massive transfusion, and in patients with liver dysfunction or under general anesthesia, calcium replacement therapy should be guided by the patient\u2019s ionized calcium concentration.",

The activity of tenase (FVIIa/tissue factor) and prothrombinase (FXa/FVa) complexes is directly dependent on temperature, with both showing a 1.1-fold loss of activity at 33 \u00b0C as compared to 37 \u00b0C (Meng et al. 2003). Even more dramatically, FVIIa/tissue factor and FXa/FVa show sharp decreases in activity in acidic environments, with activity decreasing by 55 and 70 % at pH 7.0, respectively (Viuff et al. 2008).
