This model, like that previous model, is applicable to a variety of emerging and re-emerging pathogens exhibiting an observable latent period as well as symptomatic and asymptomatic infections. The specificity of the present model is the further incorporation of Erlang distributions of the time of sojourn in some of the important compartments in the model. Indeed, most of the work we have carried out so far on COVID-19 has concerned predictions over a short time period, often no more than a month. In this context, incorporating a better description of sojourn times is extremely important. The present model generalises the simple 3-compartment SIR model to age of infection models, providing a reasonable approximation to the details of progression through infection with a minimal number of parameters and the convenience of an ODE model over integral or PDE models.",

Furthermore, because the time horizon for simulations is very short in comparison to reported estimates of incubation period [4, 9] and communicable period [5] , making a more appropriate description of sojourn times in the incubation, symptomatically infectious and asymptomatically infectious compartments is important. Although not ideal, we use an Erlang distribution, i.e., a Gamma distribution with integer shape parameter. To simplify the problem, we use two compartments for each of the L, I and A states [1] .

A wide range of possible duration have been reported. Let us suppose, for instance, that the mean incubation period of COVID-19 is 5.2 days as reported by [10] . Then, comparing the fraction of individuals infected at time 0 and still incubating at time t, we obtain Figure 1 . The Erlang distribution thus allows both a less pronounced early end and a less extended duration of the incubation period. If need be, we could further extend this behaviour by adding more compartments and thus increasing the shape parameter of the Erlang distribution. Note that this does not increase the complexity of the model and, for instance, parameter fitting procedures, since we use the same parameter for all compartments in these \"chains\"; for instance, the incubation period is described using the single parameter \u03b5; the only difference with the exponential case is that, here, 2/\u03b5 is the mean sojourn time in the combined L 1 and L 2 compartments.",

However, past initial transients and before I becomes close to E 0 , (7) provides a characterisation of the phase the epidemic is currently in. If S > \u03a8(I), then the \"natural tendency\" of the epidemic is to propagate more. When enough susceptible individuals have been \"consumed\" by the infection, i.e., when S < \u03a8(I), the epidemic cannot sustain itself anymore. For perspective, in the context of COVID-19 and using time units of days and mass action incidence, \u03b5 is of the order of 10 \u22121 while \u03b2 is typically several order of magnitude smaller, so the factor \u03b5/\u03b2 in (7) is in the range [10 4 , 10 7 ]. Note that because only I 1 and I 2 are observable, determining whether (7) holds is impossible in the field. On the other hand, this is easily done when considering numerical simulations. The peak is then the point at which prevalence of the infection in the population is maximum. Here, we focus on the observable peak, i.e., the one that can actually be measured in real life data. Because of that, we consider the peak to happen at the time when the observable part of the epidemic, i.e., the number of infectious individuals I 1 + I 2 , is maximum.
