Both viruses cause pneumonia and bronchiolitis, with variable severity of illness according to age [12] . Although HMPV disease is generally less severe compared to RSV, the incidence of infections caused by HMPV is similar to that of influenza and parainfluenza, and it causes a significant number of hospitalizations every year [13] . Infections with either virus are associated with the development of asthma and its exacerbations, yet the causal relationship has not been established [2, 14, 15] .

One of the reasons for the slow progress in this field is the clinical failure of formalin-inactivated RSV-vaccine (FI-RSV) that occurred in the 1960s. The administration of FI-RSV led to the development of an exaggerated immune response to wild type (wt) RSV infection with enhanced pulmonary disease (EPD) and two vaccinated children died [26] . EPD has been further documented in various animal models, indicating that it is not only a human phenomenon [27] [28] [29] [30] . A similar effect was observed for a formalin or heat-inactivated HMPV vaccine, which induced the symptoms of EPD in rodents [31, 32] . Another reason for slow vaccine development is the transient immunity provided by natural infection with RSV and HMPV. As documented in RSV-seropositive adults, levels of RSV-neutralizing antibodies correlate with the resistance to subsequent RSV infection, but the protection they confer is incomplete and short-lasting, which results in frequent reinfections [20, 33] . The immune response to primary HMPV infection was described to be weak and aberrant in BALB/c mice, with excessive Th2-cytokines production at later stages of infection, which correlated with airways hyperresponsiveness and the development of asthma [34] . Pneumoviruses have also developed many mechanisms to evade immune responses. The RSV nonstructural proteins NS1 and NS2 suppress the IFN-induced antiviral response in infected cells and removal of these proteins resulted in the induction of high levels of IFN alpha and beta in vitro [35] [36] [37] . HMPV shares with RSV the same ability to decrease IFN response, despite the lack of NS1 and NS2 proteins. It has been documented that HMPV-G protein has the ability to inhibit the IFN type 1 response in vitro and in vivo [38, 39] and that its SH and M2-2 proteins can also modulate the host's immune responses [40] [41] [42] . Both HMPV and RSV can persist in the lungs of an infected animal host, despite the presence of neutralizing antibodies [34, 43] . Such persistence has been documented by RT-PCR detection of viral RNA in the guinea pig and mouse models for RSV [44] [45] [46] and in mice for HMPV [43] . Another hurdle to effective immunization is the presence of maternal antibodies in the bloodstream of vaccinated infants that can impair the immunogenic effect of the vaccine [47] , yet the role of maternal antibodies in RSV infection is not fully understood [48] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 571, "end": 575, "text": "[26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 686, "end": 690, "text": "[27]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 691, "end": 695, "text": "[28]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 696, "end": 700, "text": "[29]", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 701, "end": 705, "text": "[30]", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 832, "end": 836, "text": "[31,", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 837, "end": 840, "text": "32]", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 1204, "end": 1208, "text": "[20,", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 1209, "end": 1212, "text": "33]", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 1465, "end": 1469, "text": "[34]", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 1756, "end": 1760, "text": "[35]", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 1761, "end": 1765, "text": "[36]", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 1766, "end": 1770, "text": "[37]", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 1994, "end": 1998, "text": "[38,", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 1999, "end": 2002, "text": "39]", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 2083, "end": 2087, "text": "[40]", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 2088, "end": 2092, "text": "[41]", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 2093, "end": 2097, "text": "[42]", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 2219, "end": 2223, "text": "[34,", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 2224, "end": 2227, "text": "43]", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 2343, "end": 2347, "text": "[44]", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 2348, "end": 2352, "text": "[45]", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}, {"start": 2353, "end": 2357, "text": "[46]", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}, {"start": 2379, "end": 2383, "text": "[43]", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 2561, "end": 2565, "text": "[47]", "ref_id": "BIBREF47"}, {"start": 2645, "end": 2649, "text": "[48]", "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Need for a Vaccine"}, {"text": "The main objectives in pneumovirus vaccine development are to avoid EPD and obtain sufficient immunogenicity without causing disease. Viral protein antigens can be used as subunit vaccines to example, by rearranging the order of genes in terms of 3'-5' expression gradient, as it is observed in paramyxoviruses. Gene order can also be changed in a more invasive way by moving virulence genes from the high-expression position to the low-expression locus. Alternatively, the replication efficiency can be decreased by deletions or silencing of nonessential viral proteins that play an accessory function in the life cycle of the virus. It is also possible to swap some of the genes between strains of different host preferences, thus introducing new host range restrictions. HMPV virus with the P gene exchanged for its AMPV_C counterpart (rHMPV-P A ) was more attenuated than wt HMPV, and yet protective against HMPV infection in African green monkeys (AGMs) [116] .

Similarly to RSV, the target populations for HMPV vaccination are young children, elderly people, and pregnant women [117] . Early vaccination of infants and young children can potentially prevent HMPV-infections and the transmission of the virus. Replication-competent vaccines, namely, live-attenuated HMPV or recombinant viruses are a good choice for this population. Another vaccine strategy, prime-boost regimen, consists of vaccinating with gene-based/live vaccine first and then with a protein/particle-based vaccine [118] . Immunization of pregnant women can not only provide a passive antibody transfer to their children but also prevent a mother-to-child transmission of HMPV. Live vaccines are considered being too risky to be used in this population; therefore, subunit vaccines or VLPs with standard adjuvants should be considered. The effect of vaccination of adult populations with live vaccines can be hampered by the presence of anti-HMPV antibodies in the bloodstream or in the respiratory tract (RT). For the vaccination of elderly people, who had experienced multiple HMPV infections, subunit or VLPs with a potent adjuvant are recommended [118] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 211, "end": 216, "text": "[117]", "ref_id": "BIBREF118"}, {"start": 618, "end": 623, "text": "[118]", "ref_id": "BIBREF119"}, {"start": 1254, "end": 1259, "text": "[118]", "ref_id": "BIBREF119"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Target Populations"}, {"text": "One of the strategies aimed to circumvent the problem of incomplete immunity provided by natural HMPV infection is to express its protective antigens in the backbone of a more immunogenic virus. The increase in immunogenicity can also be provided by improved antigen expression by the vector, as demonstrated for a recombinant bovine/human PIV3 (rB/HPIV3) expressing either RSV-F or G proteins [60] and for human parainfluenza type 1 virus (HPIV1) expressing HMPV antigens [54] . HMPV is difficult to grow in cell culture; vectoring its antigens with the backbone of a better-replicating virus can facilitate vaccine development and manufacturing. For instance, rB/HPIV3 expressing RSV-F reaches 10-100-fold higher viral titers in vivo compared to wt RSV [60] and replicates more efficiently in the RT of AGMs than wt RSV or HMPV [119, 120] . Expression of a foreign antigen in the backbone of another virus can also mitigate the problem of pre-existing immunity that often diminishes the effect of the vaccine. Using vectors of another host range can facilitate the immunization of seropositive individuals with no risk of causing disease, as it has been described for Newcastle Disease Virus (NDV) expressing RSV-F. The majority of live vaccines against RSV and HMPV up to date have been attenuated by a few codon changes in their genome. Therefore, using more stably attenuated backbone can render the attenuation more reliable, and decrease the risk of the reversion of an attenuated phenotype. The insertion of an additional gene can itself influence the virus' replicative capacity, thus limiting its ability to spread and cause the disease, but also to create the risk of overattenuation. This subtle balance between attenuation and immunogenicity remains the major challenge of vaccine development.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 394, "end": 398, "text": "[60]", "ref_id": "BIBREF60"}, {"start": 473, "end": 477, "text": "[54]", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}, {"start": 755, "end": 759, "text": "[60]", "ref_id": "BIBREF60"}, {"start": 830, "end": 835, "text": "[119,", "ref_id": "BIBREF120"}, {"start": 836, "end": 840, "text": "120]", "ref_id": "BIBREF121"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Vector-Based Chimeric Vaccines"}, {"text": "In general, vector-based chimeric vaccines retain the advantages of live attenuated vaccines and they can be readily generated by reverse genetics. Most of the backbones used so far for vectoring pneumoviral antigens belong to the Paramyxoviridae family. These viruses are closely related, both phylogenetically and structurally, to pneumoviruses. This close relationship increases the chance of an efficient expression and integration of a pneumoviral protein in the background of a paramyxoviral vector. Among paramyxoviruses, the most widely used vaccine backbones are bovine parainfluenza virus type 3 (BPIV3) and its recombinant derivative rB/HPIV3, HPIV1, parainfluenza virus type 5 (PIV5), Newcastle Disease Virus (NDV), and Sendai virus (SeV). The reasons explaining this frequent use of paramyxoviruses as vaccine backbones are numerous: First, their genomes are well-characterized and complete genomic sequences of all known members of this family are easily accessible [121] . Second, their genomes are simple and organized in a modular way. Tandem alignment of the genes, of which the most are transcribed as separate mRNA products, facilitates genetic manipulations [122] . Third, most paramyxoviruses are able to replicate efficiently in cell lines certified for vaccine manufacture, such as Vero cells, which can facilitate vaccine development [122] . Fourth, as they replicate entirely in the cytoplasm and their replication cycle does not involve the integration into the host cell genome, their use is potentially safe [121] . Also, recombination events between mononegaviruses have not been observed in nature and they remain extremely rare in vitro, even in optimized conditions [123, 124] , indicating that there is a low probability of gene exchange between engineered vaccine viruses and the pathogens present in the environment. Fifth, the small probability of recombination also contributes to the stability of a genetic insert, providing a stable foreign gene expression system. Paramyxoviruses are able to stably express several exogenes simultaneously and the level of expression can be manipulated by changing the position of gene insertion [125] .

The genomic RNA of paramyxoviruses and pneumoviruses does not exist as an unbound RNA-particle: it is always assembled with numerous copies of N protein and forms a helicoidal nucleocapsid. In paramyxoviruses, each N protein molecule is associated with precisely six nucleotides, a feature that is believed to underlay the ''rule of six'', i.e., the length of the genome of paramyxoviruses has to be a multiple of six for an effective viral replication [134, 135] . The stringent adhesion to this rule is observed for SeV [136] ; for other viruses, like PIV5, NDV, and HPIV3, it strongly increases the efficacy of replication [137] [138] [139] .

In the first study, an HMPV chimera with either N (rHMPV-N A ) or P (rHMPV-P A ) gene exchanged for its AMPV_C counterpart was tested as a vaccine in hamsters and AGMs ( Table 6 ). The N and P genes of AMPV_C share 75 and 68% nucleotide sequence identity with their HMPV counterparts, which suggested good integration of heterologous proteins into the HMPV particle [4, 211] . rHMPV-N A and rHMPV-P A viruses replicated more efficiently in vitro, compared to their parental HMPV strain. When tested in vivo in hamsters, the replication of both chimeric viruses was decreased 100-fold, and rHMPV-N A was slightly more attenuated than rHMPV-P A . Both chimeras were equally immunogenic and protected the vaccinated animals from wt HMPV infection. When tested in AGMs, rHMPV-P A was more attenuated than rHMPV-N A and was almost equally immunogenic, and both chimeras conferred protection against wt HMPV [116] . This study identified the more attenuated HMPV-P A chimera as a more promising vaccine candidate for further development. The rHMPV-P A virus has been recently tested as a vaccine in phase 1 clinical trial sequentially in adults, HMPV-seropositive and HMPV-seronegative children (NCT01255410) [25] . The trial found rHMPV-P A virus being appropriately restricted in adults and seropositive children, yet insufficiently infectious and immunogenic in HMPV-seronegative children, thus leaving no other candidates for an anti-HMPV vaccine in clinical trials.

Despite many years of research, no vaccine against either HMPV or RSV is currently available, underlining the need for novel solutions for vaccine design and/ or optimization of existing strategies. Generation of recombinant chimeric vaccines that protect against more than one pathogen is an advantageous and practical solution for elaborating a promising vaccine candidate. Many studies were performed on vaccines containing an antigen of RSV expressed by a heterologous virus, mainly the F protein, and some of these bivalent vaccines were advanced to clinical trials. Although the possibilities of generating chimeric vaccines against HMPV were less-explored than for RSV, numerous similarities between the two viruses can serve as a guide for the design of anti-HMPV vaccines. The antigens of HMPV and RSV were successfully expressed by various viral vectors, most of which belong to the Paramyxoviridae family. Notwithstanding that paramyxoviruses can readily express exogenous proteins from an added gene in their genome, many different factors condition the viability of a chimeric virus, the efficacy of exogene expression and the immunogenicity of a vaccine candidate. Not only does the choice of vector virus need be taken into consideration, various other aspects, namely, the positioning of an exogene in the vector's genome, the size and the type of an insert, and the possibility of integration of a foreign protein into the vector's particle, should be thoroughly considered. Numerous studies on the engineering of chimeric viruses indicate that each combination exogene-vector must be carefully designed and individually verified. Recombinant vaccine candidates against either HMPV or RSV that have been designed up to date indicate that using another virus to express HMPV antigens, or vice versa, can make it possible to overcome some major hurdles in HMPV vaccine development and obtain a good balance between immunogenicity and attenuation of a live recombinant vaccine.
