By electron microscopy, it is demonstrated with a typical sphere shape and a diameter of 80\u2013120 nm. Its nucleocapsid is spirally symmetric with envelope. The isolated strain is initially filament-like with a diameter of about 20 nm and a length of 300\u20133,000 nm. Under an electron microscope, hemagglutinin protrudes into a homotrimer composed of three non-covalent combined protein molecules, while neuraminidase is demonstrated as a mushroom-like homotetramer with a head and a stem. The virus is composed of an envelope, matrix protein, and viral core, consecutively from external to internal of the virus.",

Its envelope is covered by two types of surface glycoproteins, hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N). H can be further divided into 15 subtypes, while N 9 subtypes. All human influenza viruses can cause avian influenza, but not all avian influenza viruses can result in human influenza. Among all avian influenza viruses, H5, H7, H9, and H3 can infect humans, and H5 is highly pathogenic. Influenza virus can be categorized into 135 subtypes by HxNx, including avian influenza virus subtype H7N9. It prevailed in birds with no infection of humans. And its biological properties, pathogenicity, and transmissibility largely remain unknown. H7N9 is a new recombinant virus with its genes from avian influenza virus H9N2. Currently, it has been found with mutation of PB2 gene at the site of 701. Laboratory experiments have demonstrated that the mutated virus is highly pathogenic to Canidae. Mutation of 627 amino acid site is also possible. Therefore, avian influenza virus H7N9 cannot be transmitted from person to person but only from pets or living poultry to person.",

However, in rare cases, the lesions are partially absorbed with development of fibrosis or proliferation of pulmonary interstitial tissues. Obvious proliferation of pulmonary interstitial tissues may occur 30\u201340 days after the onset, firstly occurring as thickening of interlobular septum and intralobular interstitium as well as subpleural arc shape linear shadow. The flakes of shadow at the lungs shrink with increased density, with following occurrence of high-density cord-like or honeycomb-like shadow. In some serious cases, pulmonary interstitial proliferation causes shrinkage of lung volume and shift of mediastinum towards the affected lung. Pulmonary interstitial proliferation may extensively exist at the lungs, characterized by thickening of interlobular septum, intralobular septum, and interstitium as well as subpleural arch shape linear shadow. Pulmonary interstitial fibrosis is characterized by honeycomb-like shadow and referred bronchiectasis. After the conditions remain stable, the lesions begin to be absorbed, with decreased range and decreased density. In some cases, despite no abnormal findings by X-ray, CT scanning still demonstrates light ground-glass opacity, which may remain for a long period of time. Therefore, regular CT scanning is recommended to demonstrate lesions that fail to be demonstrated by X-ray. The reexaminations by CT scanning should be regularly performed till complete absorption of the lesions. During absorption of the lesions, pulmonary interstitial proliferations may be observed (Figs. 18.1, 18.2, 18.3, 18.4, and 18.5).\n\n\n\n\n",

She had no remarkable cough with sputum. By routine blood test, WBC 3.68 \u00d7 109/L and N 58.1 %. By routine urine microscopy, erythrocytes 15\u201320/HP. At a local hospital, she was suspected to have viral upper respiratory infection and was then treated with anti-viral oral medication. After positive therapy, her temperature still fluctuated around 39 \u00b0C, and she went to the emergency department of our hospital on March 27, 2013. By auscultation, breathing sound at both lungs is rough with a few moist rales. Chest CT scanning indicated consolidation shadow at the right upper lung lobe, which was suspected to be inflammatory disease. By routine blood test, WBC 5.35 \u00d7 109/L and N 68.2 %, and by routine urine microscopy erythrocytes 16\u201320/HP as well as normal BUN and creatinine. The patient was immediately administered anti-infection and symptomatic supportive treatment. After these therapies, her body temperature failed to return to normal and reached to the highest temperature of 39.5 \u00b0C on March 29. She then developed chest distress and cough with rare foamy sputum that is difficult to be expectorated. Meanwhile, hypoxemia occurred. Thus, the administered antibiotic was upgraded to Tienam to fight against the suspected infection. BiPAP and methylprednisolone were also administered to facilitate ventilation, anti-inflammation, and bronchial dilation. After the active therapy, the high body temperature slightly decreased but hypoxemia gradually aggravated. By auscultation, breathing sound at both lungs is rough, with moist rales at the right upper lung. X-ray indicated extensive inflammation at both lungs and lobar pneumonia at the right upper lung. She was immediately offered SIMV + PSV via tracheal intubation and treated with additional medicine including norvancomycin and acyclovir to fight against the infection and virus. Her oxygen saturation fluctuated between 75 and 80 %, indicating severe conditions. And she was transferred to ICU due to suspected diagnosis of severe pneumonia and respiratory failure. By physical examination, T 37.3 \u00b0C, P 66/min, R 20/min, and BP 171/84 mmHg. She was unconscious and had cyanosis at lips and weakened breathing movement at the right side. Percussion demonstrated dullness at the right upper lung while clear sound at the other lung fields. The breathing sound was rough at both lungs with moist rales, particularly at the right upper lung.

On April 13, 2013, SpO2 decreased to 65 % with fluctuating blood pressure and a minimum of 79/43 mmHg. Her highest body temperature was 40.3. Treated by modified therapies, the heart rate and blood pressure once returned to normal, but finally clinical death was declared after emergency rescuing.
