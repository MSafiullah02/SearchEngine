Wet disinfection has been found to be the most effective feed mill equipment surface decontamination method (Muckey, 2016) . However, this is not practical in most current commercial feed production settings. Methods to chemically or thermally mitigate the risk of PEDV transmission in feed and feed ingredients have been investigated . These methods are not universally applicable to all feed manufacturing facilities due to equipment cost or safety concerns. Other research has assessed sequencing batches of PEDV-negative feed following an inoculated batch of feed to assess the effectiveness of reducing the risk of viral transmission (Schumacher et al., 2016a) . Although this may be a practical mitigation technique for feed mills to implement, there remains a significant quantity of viral particles on feed-contact surfaces including dust production and distribution throughout the facility . This dust may pose a risk for contamination of subsequent diets. One potential solution is to use chemical mitigants such as formaldehyde or medium-chain fatty acids (MCFA) as a periodic flush step within the feed manufacturing process. Rice hulls were selected as the carrier for this chemical flush because of the relatively low cost and high degree of abrasiveness, which may help facilitate the removal of viral contamination on equipment surfaces.

In such event that biosecurity measures fail and pathogens such as PEDV enter a feed manufacturing facility, methods to reduce risk of PEDV transmission by feed or ingredients shift to mitigation strategies. Multiple strategies have been proposed to reduce transmission, typically falling into point-in-time or residual duration of activity strategies. Point-in-time strategies include the use of irradiation and thermal processing, whereas residual duration of activity strategies is commonly thought of as chemical mitigation in which feed additives such as MCFA, formaldehyde, essential oils, and dietary acidifiers are included to reduce risk of disease transmission.

In a similar manner by which pharmaceutical compounds are flushed through feed manufacturing equipment (FDA, 1976) , sequencing of feed has been proposed to potentially reduce subsequent cross-contamination of PEDV (Schumacher et al., 2016b) . The quantity of detectible genetic material was reduced as subsequent batches of feed were manufactured. Also, genetic material was detectible for a longer duration in samples collected from the discharge spout of the experimental bucket elevator compared with samples collected from the mixer. Samples collected from the mixer caused infection for 2 subsequent batches of feed, whereas no samples collected from the bucket elevator discharge spout for batches of feed following the inoculated batch caused infection. Thus, it has been shown that contamination within feed manufacturing equipment can be reduced using protocols to minimize contamination in later batches of feed. In relation to the current study, a similar reduction in the amount of quantifiable genetic material was observed with increasing number of batches through the mixing and handling equipment. Increasing the number of batches through a system reduces the level of contamination within the feed and on feed contact surfaces. However, environmental contamination is still a significant concern. In the current study, the presence of detectible viral RNA in the 10% MCFA-treated rice hull flush sample collected from the bucket elevator discharge spout, whereas no genetic material was found when collected from the mixer suggests that bucket elevators can be a significant cross-contamination source within feed manufacturing systems.
