Mitigation activities address either or both of the two components of risk, which are probability (likelihood) and consequence. By mitigating either of these components, the risk becomes much less of a threat to the affected population. In the case of natural disasters, the ability of humans to limit the probability of a hazard is highly dependent on the hazard type, with some hazards such as hurricanes or tornadoes impossible to prevent, while avalanches, floods, and wildfires are examples of hazards for which limiting the rate of occurrence is possible.",

Although this new plan did not directly define the phases of incident management, it introduced to users the sequential terminology of prevention, preparedness, response, recovery, and mitigation. The use of this terminology reflects two major changes with respect to the classical incident management approach in the United States. The first change is that mitigation is placed last in this cycle of incident management, which could indicate to readers that the activity (in the context of the plan) is perceived as a postincident one. This is significant mainly because it is altering a set terminology, which has already been widely understood and accepted within the emergency management discipline, feasibly resulting in unnecessary confusion. The second change, which is surely the more radical of the two, is the introduction of the term prevention, not only as a concept but also as a distinct phase in the incident management cycle. The plan defined prevention as \u201cactions taken to avoid an incident or to intervene to stop an incident from occurring, which involve actions taken to protect lives and property.\u201d The NRP, like the FRP, was a comprehensive plan developed according to the all-hazards approach, but the inclusion of prevention as a separate incident phase (especially in light of the preceding definition) gave rise to the question of whether the NRP was focused primarily on terrorism incident management. Prevention does not seem applicable to most natural disasters.\n",

In the NRP, prevention was introduced as a distinct phase in the incident management cycle, and in many (but not all) references, as a replacement for mitigation. The NRF makes no direct reference to the emergency management cycle, and refers more sensibly to the terms prevention and mitigation. Mitigation is used comfortably and consistently as part of the all-hazards approach, thereby providing clarity throughout the document. The choice not to push prevention as a distinct emergency management phase is consistent with former Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Michael Chertoff\u2019s vision to establish DHS as managing all hazards rather than having a distinct focus on terrorism. The term prevention is most closely associated with terrorism, and therefore finds little applicability in any generalized emergency management approach.",

These entities are better defined in terms of their role with regard to the emergency support functions (ESFs). The final difference is that the framework commits the federal government to the development of specific emergency response plans based on the 15 incident scenarios identified by the Homeland Security Council. Because incident scenario planning tends to create a rigid response functionality, it is difficult to agree with the approach taken. In such an approach, flexibility is sacrificed and problems may arise when real incidents do not fit the expected parameters. Additionally, this should be seen as a departure from the all-hazards approach as so many of the scores of known hazards are omitted or disregarded, though it is true that these 15 scenarios may be useful as an exercise tool.

The need for flood map modernization arises because of the dynamic nature of flood hazards that change with geography. Changing information management standards, improvements in information delivery methods such as the Internet, and advances in technologies such as GIS (geographical information systems) are other drivers behind flood map modernization. Conventional flood maps involve paper-based cartographic maps that may be many years old, providing limited accuracy in a quickly changing physical environment. To make the updating, sharing, collaboration, and delivery of those maps more efficient, Flood Map Modernization is creating electronic maps based on GIS that adhere to newest data management standards (i.e., GIS data models and meta-data).",

Relative earthquake risks of U.S. states can be viewed at the following website: http://www.fema.gov/hazard/earthquake/risk.shtm. There are multiple active faults throughout the United States. The San Andreas fault in California and New Madrid fault crossing parts of Illinois, Missouri, Arkansas, Kentucky, and Tennessee are but two examples. These faults are known to have the potential to generate very strong earthquakes. Had the 1906 San Francisco earthquake occurred today, it has been estimated that it would have affected nearly 10 million residents within a 19-county area, and would have caused economic losses ranging from $90 to $120 billion. The earthquake could damage as many as 90,000 buildings and depending on the time of the day, 800 to 3,400 people may lose their lives in collapsed buildings. Many of those consequences are preventable through effective earthquake hazard mitigation, thus the importance of the NEHRP (FEMA, 2007b).",

            "text": "Several of the recommendations made by the 9/11 Commission, discussed in Chapter 2, also include prevention components. The following examples are provided:\nPrevention of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their acquisition by terrorist groups: The 9/11 Commission underlines that about two dozen terrorist groups including al-Qaeda have attempted to acquire or develop chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear weapons. Most of those weapons can be developed relatively inexpensively if the necessary knowledge is available to terrorists. The possible consequences of an attack involving those weapons are very likely to be devastating. Therefore, preventing the proliferation of such weapons or materials that are necessary in their development is a critical task that needs to be performed. The commission recommends that the United States has to work with the international community to get this done. The commission recommends that the United States should sustain its support for the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program, which aims to secure the weapons and highly dangerous materials still scattered in Russia and other countries of the Soviet Union.\nPrevention of financial strength and flexibility of terrorist organizations: The United States and its allies made an effort to paralyze the financial networks of terrorists in the recent aftermath of 9/11. This effort aimed to reduce or eliminate the ability of terrorist groups to support their operations and maintain their existence. The experience showed that tracking and blocking of money that is potentially connected to terrorist groups is a very difficult job that demands not only international cooperation but also the convenience of national laws of international partners. Therefore, other innovative ways of reducing the financial strength and flexibility of terrorist organizations are necessary.\nPrevention of terrorist travel: With the advancements in and increased frequency of international travel, terrorist groups were able to gain the mobility to conduct attacks in different parts of the world. This gives an opportunity to governments to identify the terrorist as they enter the transportation system or the country through its border checkpoints. This is a critical task that may prevent some terrorist attacks or at least the penetration of terrorists from one country to another one. But the fact that terrorists also use local resources and people in their activities makes the challenge even tougher.\nPrevention of terrorist access to critical infrastructures and key assets: The 9/11 Commission recommends that the improvements being made to protect U.S. borders such as use of terrorist lists, biometric screening, biometric passports, and other threat-related information be shared with and implemented at access points to critical infrastructures and key assets. Such assets may include nuclear power plants, dams, and other infrastructures of national significance and consequences (9/11 Commission, 2004).\n",

Citizens, who are the most likely targets of these attacks, must be adequately prepared if any response effort is to be successful.

In such cases, it may be safer for you to evacuate or leave the immediate area. You may need to go to an emergency shelter after you leave the immediate area.How to Know If You Need to EvacuateYou will hear from the local police, emergency coordinators, or government on the radio or television if you need to evacuate. If there is a \u201ccode red\u201d or \u201csevere\u201d terror alert, you should pay attention to radio and television broadcasts so that you will know right away if an evacuation order is made for your area.What to DoAct quickly and follow the instructions of local emergency coordinators. Every situation can be different, so local coordinators may give you special instructions to follow for a particular situation. Local emergency coordinators may direct people to evacuate homes or offices and go to an emergency shelter. If so, emergency coordinators will tell you how to get to the shelter. If you have children in school, they may be sheltered at the school. You should not try to get to the school if the children are being sheltered there.The emergency shelter will have most supplies that people need. The emergency coordinators will tell you which supplies to bring with you. Be sure to bring any medications you are taking. If you have time, call a friend or relative in another state to tell him or her where you are going and that you are safe. Local telephone lines may be jammed in an emergency, so you should plan ahead to have an out-of-state contact with whom to leave messages. If you do not have private transportation, make plans in advance of an emergency to identify people who can give you a ride.Evacuating and sheltering in this way should keep you safer than if you stayed at home or at your workplace. You will most likely not be in the shelter for more than a few hours. Emergency coordinators will let you know when it is safe to leave the shelter.\nSource: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2005, www.cdc.gov.\nFEMA \u201cAre You Ready\u201d Protective Measures for a Nuclear BlastBefore a Nuclear BlastTo prepare for a nuclear blast, you should do the following:\u2022Find out from officials if any public buildings in your community have been designated as fallout shelters. If none have been designated, make your own list of potential shelters near your home, workplace, and school. These places would include basements or the windowless center area of middle floors in high-rise buildings, as well as subways and tunnels.\u2022If you live in an apartment building or high-rise, talk to the manager about the safest place in the building for sheltering and about providing for building occupants until it is safe to go out.\u2022During periods of increased threat increase your disaster supplies to be adequate for up to two weeks.\u2022Taking shelter during a nuclear blast is absolutely necessary. There are two kinds of shelters: blast and fallout:\u2022Blast shelters are specifically constructed to offer some protection against blast pressure, initial radiation, heat, and fire. But even a blast shelter cannot withstand a direct hit from a nuclear explosion.\u2022Fallout shelters do not need to be specially constructed for protecting against fallout. They can be any protected space, provided that the walls and roof are thick and dense enough to absorb the radiation given off by fallout particles.\n\nDuring a Nuclear BlastThe following are guidelines for what to do in the event of a nuclear explosion.If an attack warning is issued:\u2022Take cover as quickly as you can, below ground if possible, and stay there until instructed to do otherwise.\u2022Listen for official information and follow instructions.\nIf you are caught outside and unable to get inside immediately:\u2022Do not look at the flash or fireball \u2014 it can blind you.\u2022Take cover behind anything that might offer protection.\u2022Lie flat on the ground and cover your head. If the explosion is some distance away, it could take 30 seconds or more for the blast wave to hit.\u2022Take shelter as soon as you can, even if you are many miles from ground zero where the attack occurred \u2014 radioactive fallout can be carried by the winds for hundreds of miles. Remember the three protective factors: distance, shielding, and time.\nAfter a Nuclear BlastDecay rates of the radioactive fallout are the same for any size of nuclear device. However, the amount of fallout will vary based on the size of the device and its proximity to the ground. Therefore, it might be necessary for those in the areas with highest radiation levels to shelter for up to a month. The heaviest fallout would be limited to the area at or downwind from the explosion, and 80% of the fallout would occur during the first 24 hours. People in most of the areas that would be affected could be allowed to come out of shelter within a few days and, if necessary, evacuate to unaffected areas.Returning to Your HomeRemember the following:\u2022Keep listening to the radio and television for news about what to do, where to go, and places to avoid.\u2022Stay away from damaged areas. Stay away from areas marked \u201cradiation hazard\u201d or \u201cHAZMAT.\u201d Remember that radiation cannot be seen, smelled, or otherwise detected by human senses.\nSource: Federal Emergency Management Agency, 2005, www.fema.gov.\nDHS Ready.Gov Guidance on ExplosionsIf There Is an Explosion\n\u2022Take shelter against your desk or a sturdy table.\u2022Exit the building ASAP.\u2022Do not use elevators.\u2022Check for fire and other hazards.\u2022Take your emergency supply kit if time allows.\nIf There Is a Fire\n\u2022Exit the building ASAP.\u2022Crawl low if there is smoke.\u2022Use a wet cloth, if possible, to cover your nose and mouth.\u2022Use the back of your hand to feel the upper, lower, and middle parts of closed doors.\u2022If the door is not hot, brace yourself against it and open slowly.\u2022If the door is hot, do not open it. Look for another way out.\u2022Do not use elevators.\u2022If you catch fire, do not run. Stop-drop-and-roll to put out the fire.\u2022If you are at home, go to a previously designated meeting place.\u2022Account for your family members and carefully supervise small children.\u2022Never go back into a burning building.\nIf You Are Trapped in Debris\n\u2022If possible, use a flashlight to signal your location to rescuers.\u2022Avoid unnecessary movement so that you don\u2019t kick up dust.\u2022Cover your nose and mouth with anything you have on hand. (Dense-weave cotton material can act as a good filter. Try to breathe through the material.)\u2022Tap on a pipe or wall so that rescuers can hear where you are.\u2022If possible, use a whistle to signal rescuers.\u2022Shout only as a last resort. Shouting can cause a person to inhale dangerous amounts of dust.\nSource: Department of Homeland Security, 2005, www.dhs.gov.\n",

More importantly, a comprehensive system to address these challenges is necessary, and the adequate utilization of such a system demands the provision of training and exercises to those who will be dependent on such a system in a time of crisis. See the sidebar titled \u201cCDC\u2019s Strategic Plan for Preparedness and Response to Biological and Chemical Terrorism.\u201dCDC\u2019s Strategic Plan for Preparedness and Response to Biological and Chemical TerrorismThe CDC has developed a plan, titled the \u201cStrategic Plan for Preparedness and Response to Biological and Chemical Terrorism,\u201d that identifies preparedness and prevention, detection and surveillance, diagnosis and characterization of biological and chemical agents, response, and communication as the five focus areas for comprehensive mass casualty health incident management. Descriptions of each follow.Preparedness and PreventionDetection, diagnosis, and mitigation of illness and injury caused by biological and chemical terrorism are complex processes that involve numerous partners and activities. Meeting this challenge requires special emergency preparedness in all cities and states. CDC provides public health guidelines, support, and technical assistance to local and state public health agencies as they develop coordinated preparedness plans and response protocols. CDC also provides self-assessment tools for terrorism preparedness, including performance standards, attack simulations, and other exercises.Detection and SurveillanceEarly detection is essential for ensuring a prompt response to a biological or chemical attack, including the provision of prophylactic medicines, chemical antidotes, or vaccines. CDC is integrating surveillance for illness and injury resulting from biological and chemical terrorism into the U.S. disease surveillance systems, while developing new mechanisms for detecting, evaluating, and reporting suspicious events that might represent covert terrorist acts. As part of this effort, CDC and state and local health agencies form partnerships with frontline medical personnel in hospital emergency departments, hospital care facilities, poison control centers, and other offices to enhance detection and reporting of unexplained injuries and illnesses as part of routine surveillance mechanisms for biological and chemical terrorism.Diagnosis and Characterization of Biological and Chemical AgentsThe CDC and its partners created a multilevel laboratory response network (LRN). The LRN and its partners will maintain an integrated national and international network of laboratories that are fully equipped to respond quickly to acts of chemical or biological terrorism, emerging infectious diseases, and other public health threats and emergencies.ResponseA comprehensive public health response to a biological or chemical terrorist event involves epidemiologic investigation, medical treatment and prophylaxis for affected persons, and the initiation of disease prevention or environmental decontamination measures. CDC assists state and local health agencies in developing resources and expertise for investigating unusual events and unexplained illnesses. If requested by a state health agency, CDC will deploy response teams to investigate unexplained or suspicious illnesses or unusual etiologic agents and provide on-site consultation regarding medical management and disease control. To ensure the availability, procurement, and delivery of medical supplies, devices, and equipment that might be needed to respond to terrorist-caused illness or injury, CDC maintains a national pharmaceutical stockpile.Communication SystemsU.S. preparedness to mitigate the public health consequences of biological and chemical terrorism depends on the coordinated activities of well-trained health care and public health personnel throughout the United States who have access to up-to-the minute emergency information. Effective communication with the public through the news media will also be essential to limit terrorists\u2019 ability to induce public panic and disrupt daily life.Source: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, \u201cBiological and Chemical Terrorism: Strategic Plan for Preparedness and Response,\u201d 2005.\n",

The system describes in detail all functional areas that should be included in a comprehensive, mass-casualty health incident management system. The system is currently being implemented in Arlington County, Virginia, as part of a pilot project. The project includes restructuring the county\u2019s entire emergency medical system. A more detailed functional description of the system can be downloaded from the following website: http://www.gwu.edu/~icdrm/publications/MaHIM%20Model%20Web%20Version%20FEB%2003.pdf (Barbera and Macintyre, 2002, Barbera and Macintyre, 2003).Another Voice: Why Is Mitigation and Preparedness the Only Sustainable, Cost-Effective Way of Dealing with Emergencies?Pay Now or LaterCatastrophic disasters are associated with large losses of property and lives, where resources to cope with the disaster overwhelm local governments. Following such disasters, large amounts of capital in the form of disaster aid are necessary in order to put the physical infrastructure back to its original state. Even larger amounts \u2014 doubled, tripled, or sometimes quadrupled \u2014 are necessary to put the economic and social infrastructure back into a sustainable state. Therefore, local planners and policymakers should be extra careful when allowing settlements and the associated infrastructure systems in precarious zones such as active faults, coastal regions, flood zones, and nuclear power plants. These decisions should not only be based on scientific assessment of potential risks of failure (these are ideally embedded in building codes) but also \u201clife cycle costs\u201d of owning and operating infrastructure systems (LCCs are ideally factored into the \u201cbenefit-cost ratio\u201d for capital allocation). LCCs should include allowances for scheduled and emergency maintenance for critical parts of the system, as well as economic allowances for failures.Case in PointIn the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, the levees surrounding the city of New Orleans failed, causing the flooding of the entire city and incapacitating local response forces. The failure of the response is attributable, among other things, to the historic ill decision of settling in a very dangerous flood zone and continued expansion despite prior major flooding events, as well as the lack of funding that caused the poor maintenance and near-neglect of critical components of the levee structure which led to their compromise under extreme forces.By Irmak Renda-Tanali, DSc, MSCE, Assistant Professor; Program Director, Homeland Security Management, Information and Technology Systems Department, Graduate School of Management and Technology, University of Maryland-University College.\n",

Falcon Heights Mayor Sue Gehrz, St. Paul Mayor Randy Kelly, and other officials were joined by Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge at a symposium in St. Paul exploring how Americans can protect their food supply, workplaces, and homes. \u201cThe potential destruction to life and property from man-made disasters is so large that communities can no longer assume\u201d that agencies in neighboring communities will be available to help, Gehrz said. \u201cThat means more individuals need to be trained to assist their families and neighbors until help arrives,\u201d she said.\u201cThe only way you can secure the homeland is to make sure the hometowns are secure,\u201d Ridge told about 350 people at the symposium. The nation has strengthened security in many ways since the terror attacks of 2001, yet it still needs a greater degree of readiness, he said. \u201cWe need to consolidate most of our computer systems and databases in one seamless operation, make it easier for police to communicate with each other, with the rest of federal government, right down to the state and locals,\u201d he said.Since the September 11 attacks, the residents of Falcon Heights have worked together to plan a response to terror attacks, Gehrz said. They have created a community manual on their \u201cintergenerational organizing model\u201d and provided it to more than 70 Minnesota cities and counties. It has been used in Florida, South Carolina, and Washington, DC.In Falcon Heights, which has a population of 5,600, a total of 65 \u201cneighborhood liaisons\u201d have collected the names, addresses, and phone numbers of people on their blocks, identifying who has medical training or other specialized skills or equipment that might be useful in a disaster, Gehrz said. A neighborhood commission worked with the Red Cross to provide free first-aid training for 62 residents. Police have trained 11 residents how to direct traffic during emergencies. Others will receive 21 hours of training in how to respond to emergencies. \u201cInvolving all ages helps reduce fear and protect civil rights,\u201d said Gehrz, who is trained as a psychologist. \u201cOne of the primary goals of terrorism is to make people feel isolated and vulnerable.\u201dSource: \u201cFalcon Heights Security Efforts Are Becoming a National Model,\u201d Star Tribune, June 20, 2003, p. 19A.\n",

            "text": "A relatively new partner program of the Citizen Corps initiative is the Fire Corps program. Launched in 2004, Fire Corps is a partnership between the International Association of Fire Chiefs\u2019 Volunteer and Combination Officers Section (IAFC/VCOS), the International Association of Fire Fighters (IAFF), the National Volunteer Fire Council (NVFC), and the U.S. Fire Administration (USFA). Its mission is to help career, volunteer, and combination fire departments supplement existing personnel resources by recruiting citizen advocates. In June 2005, the program signed up its first 250 fire departments in its \u201ccitizen advocates\u201d program. The purpose of the program is to help fire departments expand existing programs \u2014 or assist in developing new ones \u2014 that recruit citizens who donate their time and talents to support the fire service in nonoperational roles. Within the first 4 years of its existence, Fire Corps has expanded its organization to many states. Currently, the organization has a division advocate for all 7 divisions across the United States, and 52 state advocates that represent 28 states. More information about Fire Corps can be found at http://firecorps.org (Fire Corps, 2008). The president\u2019s FY 2012 budget requested $9.8 million for the program (DHS, 2011b).\nThe SAFE ConferenceThe first annual conference on \u201cThe Community and Homeland Security,\u201d in cooperation with the SAFE project, took place in San Francisco on March 27 and 28, 2003. The aim of the conference was to bring together local leaders from several states, leaders responsible for shaping homeland security programs and activities in their communities, with representatives from federal, state, local, nonprofit, private, and international organizations working on homeland security-related issues. The conference allowed all these practitioners, participants, and representatives to voice their concerns and to share their experiences and gave them their first opportunity not only to work together to identify existing problems with homeland security at the local level but also to propose possible solutions to these problems.Four principal areas of concern on the community level emerged from the discussions in the conference:\u2022Resources: Greater access to resources to fund homeland security programs and projects at the community level\u2022Information: Greater access to practical information about application, eligibility, recruitment, retention, and other concerns\u2022Programming: The need for innovative and effective programming ideas\u2022Customizing: The need to focus on diverse and \u201cspecial needs\u201d populations\nTo create more resources and to use available resources more effectively, the following ideas were developed in the conference:\u2022Block grants to communities are an efficient means for providing federal funding for community homeland security efforts.\u2022Communities should partner with the National Governor\u2019s Association, the United States Conference of Mayors, the League of Cities, and other professional associations seeking federal funding for community homeland security efforts.\u2022Creative funding ideas practiced in communities around the country need to be identified and widely disseminated among community homeland security officials.\u2022New partnerships need to be established with the country\u2019s business and philanthropic communities to leverage their resources for community homeland security efforts.\nSuggestions for improving access to accurate and timely information regarding homeland security issues included the following:\u2022Establishing an information clearinghouse to catalog homeland security information sources\u2022Establishing a Web-based \u201cchat room\u201d for community officials to exchange ideas and best practices and to discuss current issues\u2022Establishing a \u201cfunding exchange\u201d to share ideas on funding sources and creative funding ideas\n\u2022Partnering with the Department of Homeland Security and state homeland security operations to facilitate the flow of information on federal and state programs and funding opportunities to community officials.\nIn addition to the homeland security programming currently in place (e.g., CERT training, Medical RSVP), conference participants identified a need to design and implement programs that fully leveraged the capabilities of volunteers in the community. Several ideas were considered, including the following:\u2022The SAFE Project, designed to develop volunteer programs in support of community emergency management and homeland security operations\u2022The development of Community Emergency Networks (CENs), designed to facilitate communications between community residents and local homeland security officials before, during, and after a disaster or terrorism incident\nSome of the ideas developed in the conference regarding the \u201cspecial needs\u201d populations were as follows:\u2022Reprogramming Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) funding targeted for \u201cspecial needs\u201d populations to include homeland security efforts\u2022Establishing \u201clanguage and culture banks\u201d in communities to facilitate communications and information flow between public safety and emergency officials and \u201cspecial needs\u201d populations\u2022Partnering with national associations and groups that represent the interests of special needs populations such as the elderly, veterans, minority populations, children, and the disabled\u2022Partnering with foundations and other philanthropic organizations, such as the Annie E. Casey Foundation, which focuses its efforts and funding in disadvantaged communities\u2022Partnering with local emergency management/homeland security and public health operations to help these groups identify and serve special needs populations in the community\nThe existence of voluntary activities for homeland security, such as the SAFE conference, is important because such activities bring together different stakeholders, provide an opportunity to share expertise and best practices, and create an environment in which public\u2013private partnerships can be initiated and brainstorming can occur.The primary concern of those in attendance was well stated by Carol Lopes (Berkeley, California), who said, \u201cThough there has been a lot of progress, we are willfully unprepared. Community and neighborhood preparedness is the centerpiece of today\u2019s work. Our responsibility is to prepare a community before a disaster and assist after a disaster strikes. We must train a cadre of emergency prepared individuals who will interface well with first responders.\u201dSaid Chuck Supple (GO SERV): \u201cWe must engage citizens to address problems in their own communities to have the greatest possible impact in Community Homeland Security.\u201d\nSaid Valli Wasp (Austin, Texas): \u201cPreparedness must be addressed locally. We need to take this to \u2018homes\u2019 \u2014 get rid of the \u2018land,\u2019 get rid of the \u2018security\u2019 \u2014 this is about people protecting their homes. If you want people to listen to you, you have to go to where they live.\u201dSaid Eileen Garry (U.S. Department of Justice): \u201cEvery good idea I have ever heard came from the local level.\u201dOne participant expressed concern that \u201cmaking us fundraisers, in addition to our programmatic [tasks], really stretches municipalities\u2019 resources thin. The raw numbers of people required for fundraising exhausts programs.\u201d However, such fundraising actions are recognized as vital to any program\u2019s success, echoed by Doris Milldyke (Kansas) who said, \u201cMoney is the first goal, volunteers are the second.\u201d Ann Patton (Tulsa, Oklahoma) stated, \u201cAn information clearinghouse would be invaluable,\u201d while Doris Milldyke (Kansas) noted that information on VIPS, MRS, and other programs is \u201cnotoriously difficult to find,\u201d adding, \u201cwe need a golden key for information on getting grants.\u201dChuck Supple (California GO SERV) stated this position well in saying, \u201cWe\u2019ve probably only thought of a \u2018minutia\u2019 of the areas where volunteers would be useful.\u201dAna-Marie Jones (Oakland, California) warned that \u201cspecial needs communities are often isolated from services,\u201d adding that \u201c[programs] must have a trusted leader who either speaks or has access to the languages of all representative groups \u2014 you need more than a \u2018Spanish press release.\u2019\u201d She suggested that participants \u201cinvolve special needs communities before the disaster\u201d to be effective.Source: D.

In the days leading to the landfall of Hurricane Katrina at the shores of Florida, the ARC was initially praised for its proactive approach in prestaging volunteers and mass care resources, but as the disaster unfolded and showed its destructive face in larger geographies, issues concerning the ARC response to the disaster became more apparent.

The ARC and FEMA are the designated primary agencies for ESF #6 in charge of mass care, housing, and human services. The ARC is directly responsible for mass care. The NRP tasks an ESF #6 coordinator, a FEMA official with the oversight and coordination of all ESF #6 activities including mass care, which according to the ARC is not a perfect model since it designates the oversight of a core ARC competency to a non-ARC official. Therefore, during its response to Katrina, ARC in some instances bypassed the ESF #6 coordinator and tried to work with the FEMA Operations Section Chief. This resulted in tensions between the ARC and FEMA, and in many instances undermined a very much needed partnership between the two agencies.",

            "text": "Two other issues the ARC faced during its response to Hurricane Katrina were the fraudulent money transfers by some ARC subcontractors, and unacceptably long wait times on phone-based services. ARC provides cash payments to disaster victims to help them get through the first few days of a disaster until other means of relief become available. During Hurricane Katrina, ARC established call centers manned by subcontractors to register and provide cash payments to hurricane victims using the money wiring services of a private contractor. The procedure did not have adequate checks and protection against fraudulent money transfers; therefore a group of employees working for the subcontractor staffing the call center found loopholes to transfer money to themselves and their relatives who were not victims of the hurricane. None of those workers were actual ARC employees or volunteers. ARC has also been criticized by people trying to reach the call centers in that wait times were extremely long, and in many instances, hours. Some experts explain those management problems are the result of the unique financial structure of the ARC, which heavily relies on donations; donors generally want their money spent strictly on direct assistance of hurricane victims rather than fixing administrative or managerial problems. This may minimize budgets to fix problems related to functions such as operations, finance, and accounting (Washington Post, 2005).Digging Deeper: Influenza Pandemic Mitigation and Preparedness.An influenza pandemic is regarded as potentially the next large disaster that may threaten the entire globe and require the involvement of many nations and the international community for effective mitigation, prevention, preparedness, and response. Pandemic is the global outbreak of an infectious disease. The influenza pandemic is different from the seasonal flu in many ways. Among the differences are:\u2022Large or global geographic impact as opposed to local impacts of the seasonal flu\u2022Potential to quickly exhaust available resources of national health systems\n\u2022Potential to require medical supply and vaccine availability that is drastically different than what is required to deal with the seasonal flu to deal with a possible mandatory need to vaccinate masses of people within a very short time frame\u2022Long-lasting impact on the operations of the government, the general public, and the business sectors caused by drastic intervention measures, difficult to predict human response to those measures (such as risk perception and panic), suspended or delayed economic activity, and diminished confidence\nThree influenza pandemics occurred during the 20th century:\u20221918: killed 675,000 in United States and around 50 million worldwide\u20221957: killed at least 70,000 in United States and 1 to 2 million worldwide\u20221968: killed about 34,000 in United States and 700,000 worldwide\nThe urgency for influenza pandemic mitigation and preparedness has increased in the past few years primarily due to two important medical incidents that at least partially shared the characteristics of an influenza pandemic or carried the potential to evolve into a serious global pandemic. These two incidents are SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and avian influenza (bird flu). While some characteristics of the two diseases seem to be similar, essentially the root causes and the contagious behavior of those diseases are different. While both are potentially fatal respiratory infections that initiated in animals and then made the jump to humans with similar flu-like symptoms such as fever and difficulty breathing, there are two major differences. First, avian influenza is caused by a flu virus, whereas SARS has roots similar to the common cold. The second and more important difference is that SARS can be transmitted between humans, whereas in most cases of the avian flu, the transmission has occurred from a bird to a human.SARS originated in southern China in late 2002. In February 2003, cases were reported in Hong Kong (China). In just a few days, cases were observed in Vietnam, Singapore, Canada, and Germany. Between November 2002 and July 2003, more than 8,000 cases of SARS were reported globally. Those cases caused 774 deaths in 26 countries \u2014 most of which were in the Western Pacific.Avian influenza is bird disease caused by type \u201cA\u201d strains of the influenza virus. While most birds are vulnerable to the virus, many wild bird species carry the viruses with no apparent symptoms. Of all strains of avian influenza \u201cA\u201d viruses, only four are known to have caused human infections: H5N1, H7N3, H7N7, and H9N2. H5N1 causes the most dangerous and fatal infections for humans. From 2003 to 2008, 349 human cases of the avian flu from 14 countries were reported to the World Health Organization, of which 216 were fatal. Indonesia and Vietnam had the highest numbers of human avian influenza deaths, with 94 and 47 lives lost, respectively. While H5N1 is still primarily a virus that can transmit from an infected bird to a human, cases of human-to-human transmission have been confirmed in at least three incidents in Thailand, Indonesia, and Pakistan. In all of those instances, the transmission occurred through extended close contact (caretaker and infected person). Scientists are not too concerned about this type of transmission, since it is highly preventable, but the possibility of a mutation in the virus genetic code that makes the transmission among humans much easier and faster is of real concern to public health officials (see figure).\nBecause the entire world is at risk of influenza pandemic, every country is expected to enable resources for preparedness and response in case of a potential outbreak. The World Health Organization supports those efforts by making information, data, knowledge, expertise, research, and guidelines available to the international community. In 2005, the World Health Organization released the \u201cChecklist for Influenza Pandemic Preparedness Planning.\u201d The goal of the checklist is to provide national planning authorities a list of required and desired tasks to be completed to achieve a minimum level of preparedness that would increase the chance of success in an actual influenza pandemic response. The checklist is intentionally kept generic to ensure applicability in many nations with varying levels of resources and technical expertise. The checklist includes the following seven items:1.\nPreparing for an emergency: This step involves the completion of preplanning activities such as the creation of political and public awareness regarding an influenza pandemic, the establishment of an overall preparedness strategy, and the appropriation of a budget adequate to sustain preparedness activities and to pay for resources deemed essential in the preparedness strategy.2.\nSurveillance: Surveillance is one of the most critical steps of pandemic preparedness, as early detection of an outbreak is key to minimize further spread of the disease and initiation of a timely response. Unique and complex predictive procedures may be necessary to detect an outbreak in a timely fashion, which should effectively monitor and analyze multiple parameters that may be early signals of an upcoming influenza pandemic. For example, constant monitoring of daily cases that report to hospitals with flu-like symptoms may help in the creation of confidence intervals that designate normal conditions and abnormal conditions that may be associated with an uncommon demand for medical care related to a new flu outbreak.3.\nCase investigation and treatment: This step ensures the creation of capability and resources to complete a first assessment of a virus when it shows signs of a known influenza strain. Adequate laboratory capability is mandatory. Established communication mechanisms with the World Trade Organization and other relevant organizations should occur to disseminate valuable new information in a timely fashion. Guidelines on clinical treatment of the new case should be established along with adequate training for first-response personnel.4.\nPreventing spread of the disease in the community: Identification and initiation of postincident mitigation and prevention activities are crucial to stop dispersion of the disease to the general public, thus preventing an influenza pandemic outbreak. Some of the activities involved in this step are restrictions to mobility, setup of checkpoints, creation of rules for hospital admissions, creation of a communication system with the general public, and identification of priority rules in case vaccination becomes necessary with a limited supply of vaccine or other preventive medical supplies.5.\nMaintaining essential services: Government organizations and other vital services should have internal organizational continuity plans to make sure that they can still provide the services the public expects from them even under the extreme operational conditions of an influenza pandemic outbreak. Government agencies in most nations have laws that require them to develop continuity plans, but those plans should be revised and improved based on the unique sets of challenges that may be posed as a direct consequence of the pandemic outbreak.6.\nResearch and evaluation: While countries dealing with an actual influenza pandemic outbreak are very likely to become stretched for resources, an actual outbreak is an important opportunity for research and data collection to improve existing strategies and to test control measures applied for their level of effectiveness. Therefore, nations should make research and evaluation part of their response strategy and establish relationships and partnerships with other nations to ensure that scientific exchange among research communities is not impaired by the circumstances of the ongoing incident.7.\nImplementation, testing, and revision of national plan: Revision of the national plan for applicability and testing it to improve its use during an actual outbreak are necessary. Make sure to set clear goals and measures of effectiveness that make progress evaluation of the plan easier during actual plan activation.\nIn the United States, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) holds primary responsibility for the coordination of influenza pandemic preparedness, as determined by the Homeland Security Council document, \u201cNational Strategy for Pandemic Influenza.\u201d The strategy identifies the following three pillars for effective management of a potential influenza pandemic:\u2022\nPreparedness and communications: Understand roles and responsibilities of different government agencies for the purposes of a potential influenza pandemic outbreak. Establish communications mechanisms and chain of command for effective incident management and decision making.\u2022\nSurveillance and detection: Ensure continuous \u201csituational awareness\u201d for timely identification outbreaks to limit the spread and to protect the public.\n\u2022\nResponse and containment: Develop the capacity to effectively respond to an outbreak and establish mechanisms to minimize the spread of an overall economic and societal impact of an outbreak in progress.\nSources: World Health Organization, \u201cSARS,\u201d 2003; World Health Organization, \u201cWHO Checklist for Influenza Pandemic Preparedness Planning,\u201d 2005; U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, \u201cGeneral Information on Pandemic and Avian Flu,\u201d 2008; WikiBirdFlu, \u201cRelationship between Bird Flu and SARS,\u201d 2007; World Health Organization, \u201cCumulative Number of Confirmed Human Cases of Avian Influenza A/(H5N1) Reported to WHO,\u201d 2008; Reuters, \u201cWHO Confirms Human-to-Human Bird-Flu Case,\u201d December 27, 2007; White House, \u201cNational Strategy for Pandemic Influenza,\u201d 2005.\n",

The act is in direct response to financial fraud discovered in the cases of both Enron and WorldCom. However, it was created to cover issues beyond fraud (establishing a public company accounting oversight board, auditor independence, corporate responsibility, and enhanced financial disclosure), and is now a driving force behind corporate business continuity planning. Although the phrase business continuity planning is not once mentioned in the language of the act, continuity professionals claim that Section 404 of the act implies that such measures must be taken for compliance. Section 404 of the act reads as follows:SEC. 404. MANAGEMENT ASSESSMENT OF INTERNAL CONTROLS.(a)RULES REQUIRED \u2014 The Commission shall prescribe rules requiring each annual report required by Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78m or 78o(d)) to contain an internal control report, which shall\n(1)state the responsibility of management for establishing and maintaining an adequate internal control structure and procedures for financial reporting; and(2)contain an assessment, as of the end of the most recent fiscal year of the issuer, of the effectiveness of the internal control structure and procedures of the issuer for financial reporting.\n(b)INTERNAL CONTROL EVALUATION AND REPORTING \u2014 With respect to the internal control assessment required by subsection (a), each registered public accounting firm that prepares or issues the audit report for the issuer shall attest to, and report on, the assessment made by the management of the issuer. An attestation made under this subsection shall be made in accordance with standards for attestation engagements issued or adopted by the Board. Any such attestation shall not be the subject of a separate engagement (Sarbanes\u2013Oxley Act of 2002, http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/F?c107:6:./temp/~c107*5GHak:e143423).\n\n",

            "text": "The nature of crisis, emergency, and risk management is very complicated: No matter how much one may discuss the process in the theoretical sense, the complexity of the actual environment in which they must try to implement practical applications cannot be fully appreciated. The three case studies that follow document private-sector experience with disaster, individual mitigation and preparedness, and a governmental approach to mitigation and preparedness.Case Study 1: Cantor FitzgeraldFor Joseph Noviello, September 11 began at 6:30 am with a phone call confirming that an annual fishing trip with colleagues at the Cantor Fitzgerald bond trading firm was still on, despite some foul weather offshore. Minutes later, the most intense two days of his life would begin as the first plane hijacked by terrorists crashed into Cantor\u2019s building.Watching on TV from his Manhattan apartment, Noviello had no way of knowing what lay in store. Clearly, this was a disaster of a proportion that neither he nor likely anyone in his position had dealt with before. Fortunately, he had a plan to follow.That plan may have saved the company. No firm suffered a worse fate, in terms of lives lost on September 11, than Cantor Fitzgerald and its electronic marketplace unit, eSpeed. More than 700 employees of the two companies died in the destruction of the World Trade Center\u2019s north tower, where Cantor and eSpeed shared their headquarters and a vital computer center. Yet eSpeed was up and running when the bond market reopened at 8 am on September 13, little more than 47 hours after the disaster.\n\u201cThe difference for us was the planning we had in place,\u201d says Noviello, 36, who was promoted to eSpeed\u2019s chief information officer after the disaster. eSpeed\u2019s systems were built on a dual architecture that replicated all machines, connections, and functionality at the World Trade Center and at a Rochelle Park site, with a third facility in London.eSpeed, which operates as a freestanding business and also serves as the trading engine for its parent company, lost 180 employees, including about half of its U.S.-based technology staff. But eSpeed had several important assets left. Most of the top technology executives had been out of the office, including Matt Claus, eSpeed\u2019s current CTO, and Noviello\u2019s right-hand man, who had been scheduled to go on the fishing trip.The response atmosphere was tense, with people unsure as to what had happened to their friends or colleagues. \u201cFor days, every time a new face came in the door it was an emotional release,\u201d says Noviello. \u201cThere was a disaster-recovery contact list, but people were seeking to find each other not for work but to find out who was okay.\u201dBeyond the technical questions were operational details such as advising staff on public transportation options to the suburban site, reestablishing shifts, and making sure there were counselors on duty. Conference calls every two hours kept track of milestones and objectives. \u201cWe were talking at 2 am, at 4 am,\u201d says Noviello. \u201cWho is sleeping during something like this? Work is great therapy.\u201dNone of this effort would have succeeded without the duplicate architecture in Rochelle Park. Yet Cantor started moving into the facility only in February. From day one, Rochelle Park was seen as a concurrent system, not a disaster-recovery site.All that redundancy would be stretched to the limit as eSpeed worked to overcome the technical hurdles before the opening of the bond market Thursday morning. Two of those hurdles were huge: the loss of eSpeed\u2019s private network connections and the destruction of the company\u2019s ability to handle fulfillment of trades.The first problem was solved by allowing customers who had overseas offices connected to Cantor\u2019s London data center to reroute across their own networks to London. eSpeed worked with customers to reconfigure their servers to point to London and moved or expanded the permissions on customer accounts to connect to that site. For customers without overseas private networks, eSpeed worked to get them access over the Internet until the customers could get their high-speed connections hooked into the Rochelle Park facility.To solve the second issue, help arrived in the form of one of eSpeed\u2019s competitors. ICI/ADP, another electronic trading company, offered to take care of eSpeed\u2019s clearing and settling of transactions through its own connection to banks. By Wednesday night, the eSpeed team had mapped its financial back-office system to ADP\u2019s system and had successfully sent test transactions to J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and other banks. The cooperation of other companies, including vendors and fellow financial firms, turned out to be essential to Cantor/eSpeed\u2019s quick recovery.The firm was weakened by the loss of so many people and the related shutdown of its voice-broker business. But it survived as a viable business. Thanks to planning, the company can keep operating, even if something should happen to Rochelle Park. Its data center in London will serve as the mirror site going forward.And going forward, the company\u2019s systems should be even more resilient. \u201cWe are learning a lot of lessons as we are restoring the system,\u201d says Noviello, including how to automate more aspects of bringing systems back up. \u201cAnd we are not restoring our bad habits\u201d (Summarized from the original work of Cone and Gallagher, 2001).\n\nCase Study 2: Home Alone \u2026 Emergency Plan Saves SistersWhen the strongest tornado to hit Mississippi in more than 50 years tore through the small town of Smithville on April 27, 2011, 16-year old Audrey Herren and her younger sister Cassidy, 11, knew what to do, and it probably saved their lives. They went into emergency mode \u2014 covered themselves with blankets and huddled on the floor of an inside hallway \u2014 and emerged virtually unscathed from a home that had disintegrated around them.April 27 started off on an ominous note as the town\u2019s siren was sounded several times during the morning to warn residents of the approaching severe weather system. As the potential threat to Smithville became more certain, the 600 students in the town\u2019s K-12 school complex were released early, at approximately 2 pm. Parents Jim and Carol Herren were at work at the time, but they had learned via broadcast warnings and access to radar images of the storm that Smithville was in the path of a possible tornado. They called their daughters and told them to exercise their emergency plan, which they had put to use during earlier severe thunderstorms as recently as the previous week.The tornado reached Smithville at 3:44 pm., roaring through the middle of town with peak winds estimated at 205 miles per hour. Most buildings were flattened, including more than 150 homes, 14 businesses, and 2 churches. Seventeen people lost their lives, either during the tornado or later as a result of injuries.When the Herrens reached Smithville about an hour after the tornado struck, their daughters were not at their home (or what was left of it) as they had been told to move away from the area because of possible gas leaks. They connected with the girls later. The Herren family was able to save a bit of clothing from their home, but none of their furnishings could be salvaged. Most importantly their daughters had survived the storm.\u201cEverybody in town has a tornado story,\u201d said Carol Herren, \u201cbut unfortunately, many didn\u2019t turn out as positive as ours.\u201d And although her family didn\u2019t have a safe room at the time of the tornado, she is glad they had an emergency plan and that the plan likely saved her daughters.The Herren family had occupied their home along Mississippi Highway 25, the main road through Smithville, for about 13 years. They are now living in a rented home that is just outside the tornado\u2019s path of destruction. They plan to begin construction of safe room in a new home within the next few weeks that will specifically comply with the design criteria in FEMA 361, Design and Construction Guidance for Community Safe Rooms. They know several other neighbors who plan to do the same, and Jim Herren says he hopes that many others will decide to stay and rebuild in Smithville.For additional information, contact the FEMA Safe Room Help Line at 866-222-3580 or at saferoom@dhs.gov. The help line provides information on where to go for assistance regarding hazard mitigation grants and other grant funding, project eligibility, and guidelines for safe room construction.

In an effort to prepare for disasters like the tornadoes in mid- and late April 2011, he built a safe room in his grandparents\u2019 home. Although they weren\u2019t home when the storms devastated the area, the only portion of their home left standing was the multipurpose safe room (see Figure 10\u20136\n).Blakeney and his construction company had built a few safe rooms in the past, mainly in their family members\u2019 homes. While not built according to the design criteria of Federal Emergency Management Agency\u2019s publication FEMA 320, Taking Shelter from the Storm: Building a Safe Room For Your Home or Small Business, this safe room was able to withstand the strong winds of the EF-4 tornado that ravaged the area.FEMA 320 includes construction plans and cost estimates for building individual safe rooms. A safe room, built according to the standards outlined in FEMA 320, in a home or small business provides \u201cnear-absolute protection\u201d for its occupants.\u201cWe were not familiar with FEMA specifications, but we had built a few safe rooms,\u201d said Blakeney. \u201cI was actually at the office and used the safe room we had built there when the tornado came through.\u201d\nApril\u2019s storms claimed over 40 lives in Tuscaloosa and left more than 2,000 residents homeless. The area experiences tornadoes early spring and late fall each year, but never as severe as those on April 2011.\u201cTornadoes usually hit the southern or northern parts of the town,\u201d said Blakeney about the recent events. His family had lived in Tuscaloosa County for more than 71 years. \u201cIn my time, we\u2019ve never seen one come through the area like that!\u201d The home was recently renovated so his grandparents could move from the outskirts of the city and live closer to other relatives. In the additional wing, the master bedroom closet was the perfect location to reinforce as the safe room.\u201cThey had a basement in their old home and that made them feel secure,\u201d said Blakeney. \u201cHere, they had nothing.\u201d The major home renovation was completed just 2 weeks before the storm hit the city and destroyed the home. His grandparents had not completely moved into the house and Blakeney was still adding finishing touches to the home. Fortunately, no one was home when the tornado struck because the entire neighborhood was destroyed.Safe rooms provide homeowners, like Blakeney\u2019s grandparents, relief during times where they have to quickly seek shelter. Should homeowners decide to build a safe room in their new or existing home, FEMA 320 provides examples of proper installation techniques and designs. Safe rooms built to FEMA 320 standards have saved the lives of people affected by events like the one that destroyed many areas of Alabama.\u201cWe just think it is a great investment for the sense of security,\u201d Blakeney added. \u201cWe will be building more in the future using FEMA 320.\u201d Building safe rooms according to FEMA specifications helps ensure that they will be able to withstand high winds and provide the ultimate protection. Not building according to FEMA specifications is risky and increases the likelihood of the safe room not providing the needed protection.For additional information, contact the FEMA Safe Room Help Line at 866-222-3580 or at saferoom@dhs.gov.

            "text": "The Homeland Security Council (HSC), in partnership with DHS, and state and local homeland security agencies, has developed 15 all-hazards planning scenarios for use in national, federal, state, and local homeland security preparedness activities. These scenarios are designed to be the foundational structure for the development of national preparedness standards from which homeland security capabilities can be measured (Figure 10\u20137\n). For the earthquake scenario, see the sidebar titled \u201cHSC Scenario 9.\u201d\nHSC Scenario 9: Major EarthquakeExecutive Summary\n\u2022Casualties: 1,400 fatalities; 100,000 hospitalizations\u2022Infrastructure Damage: 150,000 buildings destroyed, 1 million buildings damaged\u2022Evacuations/Displaced Persons: 300,000 households\u2022Contamination: From hazardous materials, in some areas\u2022Economic Impact: Hundreds of billions\u2022Potential for Multiple Events: Yes, aftershocks\u2022Recovery Timeline: Months to years\nScenario OverviewGeneral description: Earthquakes occur when the plates that form under the Earth\u2019s surface suddenly shift, and most earthquakes occur at the boundaries where the plates meet. A fault is a fracture in the Earth\u2019s crust along which two blocks of the crust have slipped with respect to each other. The magnitude of an earthquake, usually expressed by the Richter Scale, is a measure of the amplitude of the seismic waves. The intensity, as expressed by the Modified Mercalli Scale, is a subjective measure that describes how strong a shock was felt at a particular location.The Richter Scale is logarithmic so that a recording of 7, for example, indicates a disturbance with ground motion 10 times as great as a recording of 6. A quake of magnitude 2 is the smallest quake normally felt by people. Earthquakes with a Richter value of 6 or more are commonly considered major; great earthquakes have magnitude of 8 or more. The Modified Mercalli (MM) Scale expresses the intensity of an earthquake\u2019s effects in a given locality in values ranging from I to XII. The most commonly used adaptation covers the range of intensity from the condition of \u201cI \u2014 Not felt except by a very few under especially favorable conditions,\u201d to \u201cXII \u2014 Damage total. Lines of sight and level are distorted. Objects thrown upward into the air.\u201dIn this scenario, a 7.2-magnitude earthquake occurs along a fault zone in a major metropolitan area (MMA) of a city. MM Scale VIII or greater intensity ground shaking extends throughout large sections of the metropolitan area, greatly impacting a six-county region with a population of approximately 10 million people. Subsurface faulting occurs along 45 miles of the fault zone, extending along a large portion of highly populated local jurisdictions, creating a large swath of destruction. Soil liquefaction occurs in some areas, creating quicksand-like conditions.Timeline/event dynamics: While scientists have been predicting a moderate to catastrophic earthquake in the region sometime in the future, there were no specific indications that an earthquake was imminent in the days and weeks prior to this event.Damage includes a large multistate area of several hundred square miles. Rapid horizontal movements associated with the earthquake shift homes off their foundations and cause some tall buildings to collapse or \u201cpancake\u201d as floors collapse down onto one another. Shaking is exaggerated in areas where the underlying sediment is weak or saturated with water. (Note: In the central and eastern United States, earthquake waves travel more efficiently than in the western United States. An earthquake of a given size in the central and eastern United States may cause damage over a much broader area than the same size earthquake in California.)Several hours later, an aftershock of magnitude 8.0 occurs. Based on past events, additional aftershocks are possible. Sizable aftershocks (7.0 to 8.0 in magnitude) may occur for months after the original jolt.Secondary hazards/events: As a result of the earthquake, hazardous contamination impacts of concern include natural gas compression stations and processing plants, oil refineries and major tank farms, and natural gas/crude oil pipelines. In addition, more than 2,000 spot fires occur and widespread debris results. Flooding may occur due to levee failures and breaks in water mains and sewage systems.Transportation lines and nodes, power generation and distribution, communications lines, fuel storage and distribution, and various structures (ranging from dams to hospitals) may be damaged and will require damage assessment in order to continue operating. Reduced availability of services will be disruptive and costly.Ground shaking from the earthquake has generated massive amounts of debris (more than 120 million tons) from collapsed structures. In addition, fuel pumps in several gas stations have sustained damage, leaking thousands of gallons of gasoline into the streets. There are numerous reports of toxic chemical fires, plumes with noxious fumes, and spills. Several other local waste treatment facilities have reported wastewater and sewage discharges. A large refining spill has contaminated the port facility and is spilling into the harbor. Significant concern for spilled hazardous materials from storage, overturned railcars, and chemical stockpiles make progress very slowly as triage is conducted.Key implications: Approximately 1,400 fatalities occur as a direct result of the earthquake. More than 100,000 people are injured and continue to overwhelm area hospitals and medical facilities, most of which have sustained considerable damage. Approximately 18,000 of the injured require hospitalization. As many as 20,000 people are missing and may be trapped under collapsed buildings and underground commuter tunnels.\nMore than 1 million buildings were at least moderately damaged (40% of the buildings) and more than 150,000 buildings have been completely destroyed.Service disruptions are numerous to households, businesses, and military facilities. Medical services are overwhelmed and functioning hospitals are limited. Fire and emergency medical services (EMS) stations and trucks were also damaged. Bridges and major highways are down or blocked and damaged runways have caused flight cancellations. There are widespread power outages and ruptures to underground fuel, oil, and natural gas lines. Water mains are broken. Wastewater primary receptors have broken, closing down systems and leaking raw sewage into the streets. As a result, public health is threatened.More than 300,000 households have been displaced, and many businesses have lost employees and customers. The port has been adversely affected in its capacity to provide export/import and loading/unloading capabilities, and damage to vital parts of the communications infrastructure has resulted in limited communications capabilities.The disruption to the nation\u2019s economy could be severe because the earthquake impacts major supply and transportation centers. Reconstruction, repairs, disposal, and replacement of lost infrastructure will cost billions of dollars. Replacement of lost private property and goods could also cost billions. An overall national economic downturn is probable in the wake of this event.Mission Areas Activated\nPrevention/deterrence/protection: After the earthquake occurs, actions should be taken to protect critical facilities from terrorist attacks and to maintain civil order.Emergency assessment/diagnosis: Disaster assessments and aerial reconnaissance are necessary. Using real-time seismic data, FEMA runs an earthquake model to provide a preliminary \u201cbest guess\u201d at the level of expected damage, subject to confirmation or modification through remote sensing and field assessments. Assessment teams must be deployed and remote sensing initiated.Emergency management/response: Hazardous material spills must be managed. Emergency medical treatment, shelters, and food must be provided. A joint information center (JIC) is established, and search and rescue teams must be placed on alert, some of which should be activated and deployed. Public utilities and other basic-needs services must be repaired as quickly as possible, and damage assessments should be conducted.Incident/hazard mitigation: Federal support will be required to coordinate the development of plans to execute mitigation efforts to lessen the effects of future disasters. Mitigation to minimize or avoid future impacts would largely be an issue for recovery and restoration.Public protection: Structural engineers are inspecting critical building, bridge, freeway, waste facilities, etc., and inspection teams are deployed to inspect hundreds of homes for safe habitability.Victim care: The massive number of injured and displaced persons requires a warning order for the activation of task forces for the delivery of mass care and health and medical services. Temporary housing strategies must be considered.Investigation/apprehension: Not applicable.Recovery/remediation: Hazardous materials will contaminate many areas, and decontamination and site restoration will be a major challenge.\nSource: DHS and the Homeland Security Council.\n",

Since the onset of civilization, people have worked to limit their vulnerability to hazards once they recognized that those hazards existed. Since the attacks of September 11, the focus of mitigation has shifted primarily to mitigation, prevention, and preparedness for terrorist attacks, but the real threat has proven to be the traditional natural and man-made hazards that existed both before and after the attacks began. It is the responsibility of government, which rests most clearly on the Department of Homeland Security, to protect the nation from the consequences of disastrous events. For that reason, it is vital that the all-hazards approach to mitigation, prevention, and preparedness be maintained.",

            "text": "\nAll-Hazards PlanningThe disaster planning and preparedness philosophy that advocates for holistic preparedness and flexible disaster planning to ensure the response can be improvised to deal with the many unknowns of any disaster situation. In one sense, it is the opposite of \u201cScenario Planning.\u201dAvian InfluenzaAn infection typically seen in birds, although in rare cases human transmission has been observed. Among four strains of the virus known to be infectious for humans, H5N1 is the most dangerous one. Avian influenza is also called \u201cbird flu\u201d in daily use.Bird FluPlease refer to Avian Influenza.Business Continuity Planning (BCP)The process of identification and remediation of commercial and organizational impacts of disasters through planning and strategy. Business continuity planning typically involves strategizing for the continuity and protection of the human resource, critical business processes, information systems, infrastructure, and organizational reputation.Business Impact Analysis (BIA)The management-level analysis by which an organization assesses the quantitative (financial) and qualitative (nonfinancial) impacts, effects, and loss that might result if the organization were to suffer a business-interrupting event. Performing BIA as a preparedness measure is important because findings from BIA are used to make decisions concerning business continuity management strategy.Community Emergency Response Team (CERT)A community initiative of Citizen Corps to create disaster-resistant communities by training and disaster awareness. CERTs are composed of volunteers trained in basic disaster and medical response. As of 2008, there are more than 2,800 CERT programs all over the United States.Crisis ManagementA proactive management effort to avoid crisis, and the creation of strategy that minimizes adverse impacts of crisis to the organization when it could not be prevented. Effective crisis management requires a solid understanding of the organization, its strategy, liabilities, stakeholders, and legal framework combined with advanced communication, leadership, and decision-making skills to lead the organization through the crisis with minimizing potential loss.CrisisA critical turning point with impact to the future state of a given system. Although mostly signaling a deteriorating status of the system, if managed correctly, a crisis can be potentially beneficial. Example: Increased customer confidence to a company that has managed to survive a major crisis in the industry provides competitive advantage.Disaster Recovery Planning (DRP)The planning effort that primarily deals with the continuity and timely recovery of physical and logical components of information systems infrastructure and applications. The first goal in DRP is to ensure a redundant infrastructure that provides for continuity of information technology (IT) systems that support critical business processes. The second goal is to develop a prioritized recovery strategy for systems and applications based on their criticalities for the organization in case of an inevitable system failure or a catastrophic incident.EpidemicAn infection that affects the public in a larger proportion than day-to-day diseases and infections to the degree that resources of national medical care systems are exhausted or significantly constrained. Epidemics also typically have impacts on the social and economic infrastructures.Emergency Support Function (ESF)A specific area of expertise deemed critical for a successful disaster operation as identified by the federal disaster response framework. The Federal Response Plan (12 ESFs), the National Response Plan (15 ESFs), and the new National Response Framework (15 ESFs) each identify the various ESFs as appendices. The ESFs in the National Response Framework follow: ESF #1 \u2014 Transportation, ESF #2 \u2014 Communications, ESF #3 \u2014 Public Works and Engineering, ESF #4 \u2014 Firefighting, ESF #5 \u2014 Emergency Management, ESF #6 \u2014 Mass Care, Housing, and Human Services, ESF #7 \u2014 Resource Support, ESF #8 \u2014 Public Health and Medical Services, ESF #9 \u2014 Search and Rescue, ESF #10 \u2014 Oil and Hazardous Materials Response, ESF #11 \u2014 Agriculture and Natural Resources, ESF #12 \u2014 Energy, ESF #13 \u2014 Public Safety and Security, ESF #14 \u2014 Long-Term Community Recovery, and ESF #15 \u2014 External Affairs.Federal Response Plan (FRP)A signed agreement among 27 federal departments and agencies, including the American Red Cross, that provided a mechanism for coordinating the delivery of federal assistance and resources to augment efforts of state and local governments overwhelmed by a major disaster or emergency; replaced by the National Response Plan.HazardA potential source of danger or unsafe environment.InfluenzaA contagious infection of the respiratory tract. Common symptoms include fever, muscular pain, general tiredness, and chills. Symptoms are typically felt stronger than those caused by the common cold.Man-Made DisasterSometimes also called technological disaster. Man-made disasters have two common elements: (1) They are not primarily induced by a naturally occurring process. (2) In most instances, the cause of the disaster is human error or failure of systems designed by humans. Examples of man-made disasters include oil spills, radiological incidents, chemical releases, and transportation disasters.MitigationA sustained effort taken to reduce or eliminate risk to people and property from hazards and their effects.Natural DisasterA disaster that is primarily induced by the destructive power of nature. Examples of natural disasters include hurricane, earthquake, tsunami, and snowstorm.National Planning Scenarios (NPS)Fifteen disaster scenarios, each corresponding to one particular natural, technological, or terrorist hazard threats, which together or individually allow for a standard against which plans, capabilities, and policies may be exercised and otherwise tested or measured.National Response Framework (NRF)Presents the guiding principles that enable all response partners to prepare for and provide a unified national response to disasters and emergencies\u2014from the smallest incident to the largest emergency catastrophe; defines key principles, roles, and structures that organizes the way the nation responds; replaced the National Response Plan.National Response Plan (NRP)A national-level plan which replaced the Federal Response Plan and which was created in keeping with the national Incident Management System model to align federal coordination structures, capabilities, and resources into a unified, all-discipline, and all-hazards approach to domestic incident management.PandemicAn epidemic that impacts a large region or has global impacts.Postdisaster MitigationMitigation activities typically performed in the aftermath of a disaster either to provide a safer environment for the ongoing response or recovery effort or to mitigate potential impacts of the next disaster based on immediate lessons learned from a current one.Predisaster MitigationMitigation activities engaged prior to the occurrence of the disaster to minimize its impact when it occurs.PreparednessA state of readiness to respond to a disaster, crisis, or any other type of emergency situation.PreventionActions taken to avoid an incident or to intervene in an effort to stop an incident from occurring for the purpose of protecting lives and property.RiskAccording to Stan Kaplan, risk is comprised of three components: scenario, probability of scenario, and consequence of scenario.Tabletop ExerciseA mock disaster game in which participants playing different roles such as decision maker, incident commander, or first responder typically gather around a table and discuss/decide their responses to the incident scenario presented by a moderator. The goal of a tabletop exercise is to simulate a disaster situation for the purposes of exposing the participant to the stressful decision-making conditions of a disaster. Tabletop exercises typically conclude with a debrief session where various parties discuss their respective roles, goals established, priorities, and challenges faced regarding the scenario played.TerrorismThere are more than 100 definitions of terrorism in the literature. The United Nations defines terrorism as \u201can anxiety-inspiring method of repeated violent action, employed by (semi-) clandestine individual, group or state actors, for idiosyncratic, criminal or political reasons, whereby \u2014 in contrast to assassination \u2014 the direct targets of violence are not the main targets.\u201dTOPOFF (abbreviation for \u201ctop officials\u201d)TOPOFF is a congressionally mandated annual disaster preparedness and response exercise designed to improve the incident management/decision-making capability of the nation\u2019s top officials at every level of the government during an incident of national significance.\n",
