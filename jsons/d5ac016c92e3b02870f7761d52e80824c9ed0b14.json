This includes frequency of infection, illnesses 200 produced and transmission characteristics. We might not even know about the the two most recently identified viruses, NL63 and HKU1, if attention had 202 not been directed to HCoV following the occurrence of SARS. The development of the 203 RT-PCR test and the inclusion of the 4 types of HCoV in multiplex clinical testing 204 panels, mainly used in handling severe illnesses such as pneumonia, have resulted in 205 numerous reports of the involvement of these viruses in hospitalizations. While studies 206 of hospitalized patients have established the role of HCoV in causing lower respiratory 207 illness and the global circulation of these viruses, they are unable to shed light on the 208 frequency or seasonality of these viruses in the broader community. There are a few 209 exceptions which have followed HCoV infections over longer periods often in special 210 population groups. In particular, a recent study covered 9 years of Norwegian children 211 hospitalized with respiratory infection and found that coronaviruses were involved in 212 9.1% of episodes. 26 The highest frequencies were in young children, similar to the 213 infection rates demonstrated in the current study and also identical to it was the ordering 214 of frequency of types involved with OC43 the most common and 229E the least. While 215 the authors did not emphasize seasonality, it was clear that most of the infections 216 occurred in the winter months. 217 The regular appearance of all types of coronaviruses in the same months with minimal 218 circulation in the summer was a clear finding of this study. Unlike the influenza viruses 219 which peak at different times during the colder season from year to year and even the 220 rhinoviruses which are most common in the autumn and spring but are present year 221 round, the coronaviruses are sharply seasonal with little spread after May until 222 November or December. Our findings, on a larger scale, expand on the results a two 223year study in childcare attendees suggesting a similar seasonal pattern.27 It is of interest SARS coronavirus outbreaks occurred during the same time period, with the 225 end of global outbreaks in the period of May-June 2003.28 Whether such a time table 226applies to the current circulation of SARS-CoV-2 is impossible to determine at this time.227Another notable finding in this community study was the fact that, in those above 4228 years of age, HCoV infection rates were relatively consistent. Most agents causing 229 lower respiratory infections typically have falling incidence with increasing age, 230 sometimes with an increase in young adults. 29 However, it is clear that like other 231 respiratory viruses, HCoV infect people of all ages and infection only produces relative 232 immunity. The type-specificity of the protection is also not completely clear; although 233 frequent co-circulation of types and co-detection within individuals suggests that 234 protection is likely not highly cross-reactive.
