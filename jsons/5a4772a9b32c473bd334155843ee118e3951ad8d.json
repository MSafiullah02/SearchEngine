Complex factors such as genetic variation in the host and pathogen, environmental changes, population pressures, and global travel can all influence the emergence of infectious diseases. The SARS epidemic of 2003 highlighted the potential of an emerging pathogen to spread globally in a very short time frame (Peruski and Peruski, 2003) . The diagnostics of such infectious diseases has been greatly affected in the past 20 years. No longer is cultivation and microscopy the only means of detecting infectious agents. With the introduction of molecular diagnostics, the ability to detect minute amounts of microbial nucleic acids in clinical specimens has revolutionized clinical microbiology. In particular, the utility of PCR allows the detection and quantitation of specific agents in a matter of hours. PCR sequencing of specific segments of nucleic acid allows for the determination of specific drug resistance that now aids in guiding viral therapies.",

What Koch found was a rod-shaped bacteria in the blood of the dead cattle, which is known today as Bacillus anthracis. He was able to culture the bacteria on nutrients and then inject these cultured bacteria back into a healthy animal. The once healthy animal feel ill and died. Koch was able to again isolate the bacteria from the blood of the dead animal. By performing these series of experiments, Koch was able to demonstrate that an infectious disease, anthrax, was caused by a specific infectious agent (B. anthracis). This technique was again used to demonstrate that Mycobacterium tuberculosis was the causative agent of tuberculosis. Thus, Koch's series of experiments, known today as Koch's postulates, has provided the foundation for the study of the etiology of infectious diseases.",

There are also situations when a number of different pathogens can cause similar clinical symptoms or when a single pathogen can cause several pathologies. The application of molecular diagnostics can be very useful to overcoming these situations because these techniques allow for the rapid detection of fastidious, uncultivable, or unknown agents. Using universal primers or multiplex systems, a panel of organism targets can be used to screen for in any clinical specimen. Molecular methods are a widely used tool for epidemiological fingerprinting of isolates that are important to public health. Through the use of sequence-based identification, strain typing, and specific markers, comprehensive isolate fingerprinting can be used for the tracking and control of disease.",

            "text": "In 1995, scientists at the institute for genomic research (TIGR) unveiled the first two complete DNA sequences of the bacterial genomes Haemophilus influenzae and Mycoplasma genitalium. This was followed in 1996 by the first complete genome sequencing of an archaea, Methanococcus jannaschii. This scientific achievement was made possible through the use of automated sequencing equipment. Since 1995, TIGR and others have completed the genome sequence of many pathogens as well as a number of microorganisms of environmental relevance. Comparison of genomes can pinpoint differences between virulent and avirulent medically important pathogens. At the species level, genome comparisons can provide information about host or tissue specificity. On an evolutionary level, comparison of genomes can help to reveal the origins of microbial life (Doolittle, 2002) . Viral genomes are smaller and can mutate faster than bacterial genomes. Current technology is already tapping into the use of viral genomes for guiding drug therapies. Implementation of viral load testing and specific nucleic acid sequencing provides physicians with valuable information regarding the clinical response of patients on antiviral therapy and emergence of antiviral drug resistance (Smith et al., 2004) .",

The identification and characterization of proteins expressed in cells (microbial and host) under different cellular states is a growing area of interest. Messenger RNA is often spliced in different ways to code for different proteins; simply knowing a gene sequence and its transcriptional expression is not enough to understand critical protein functions. The study of proteomics is the next frontier in understanding genomic functionality. The goal of proteomics is to define and characterize the complete set of proteins (the \"proteome\") in an organism, tissue, or cell and determine their spatial and temporal variation. It is being increasingly applied to the study of various microbial processes (e.g., host and pathogen interactions). Proteomics holds great promise for enhancing our knowledge of how a cell functions under various conditions, thus it may allow for breakthroughs in new generations of diagnostics, antimicrobial agents, and vaccine candidates.",

Several pathogen targets have been used for direct hybridization to nucleic acid probes in situ. Bacterial targets include Helicobacter pylori (Makristathis et al., 2004) , and Legionella spp. (Hayden et al., 2001b) . Yeast forms of the dimorphic fungi (Hayden et al., 2001a) , and molds such as Aspergillus spp., Fusarium spp., and Pseudoallesheria spp. (Hayden et al., 2002 (Hayden et al., , 2003 have also proven to be useful as ISH targets. Typically, in situ hybridization is chosen when it is useful for the pathogen to be identified in association with intact cells or tissue, but branched DNA probes have been used to identify the presence of human papilloma virus (HPV) and the gene expression signal from HPV mRNA (Kenny et al., 2002) . As a method for culture confirmation, PNA FISH (peptide nucleic acid fluorescent in situ hybridization) has been used to identify Staphylococcus aureus (Stender, 2003) and coagulase-negative staphylococci from positive blood cultures (AdvanDx, Woburn, MA, USA). Although not an in situ technique, a hybridization protection assay using an rRNA probe matrix has been used for rapid identification of bacteria and fungi from routine blood cultures (Marlowe et al., 2003) . In this study, Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, other Gram-negative bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, streptococci, enterococci, other Gram-positive bacteria, anaerobes, and yeast were successfully identified using hybridization methods that proved to be both sensitive (100%) and specific (96%).",

The Nuclisens Extractor is an automated closed system. It has been compared to Qiagen manual extraction and found to be efficient for extraction of viral DNA and RNA (Gobbers et al., 2001) . The easy-MAG is an automated magnetic silica extraction system that will extract 24 samples in less than an hour. The miniMAG is a manual system that can extract 12 samples in about 35 min and offers a low-cost extraction system to a smaller molecular laboratory. Recent studies have suggested that the miniMAG consistently provides high yields of low titer of target (Tang et al., 2005) . These systems are designed to extract both DNA and RNA for use with either Nucleic Acid Sequence-Based Identification (NASBA) or PCR amplification technologies. The NucliSens Easy Q can also be coupled with these extraction methods for detection with real-time NASBA.

            "text": "The use of molecular techniques in epidemiological studies is important for rapid, focused disease detection and for implementation of infection control measures. Molecular typing has become a valuable tool in defining disease source(s), determining the transmission modalities, and tracking outbreaks (Diekema et al., 2003; Soll et al., 2003) . Pulse-field gel electrophoresis (PGFE) is considered the reference method for comparative purposes, although various methods are used (Tenover et al., 1995; Olive and Bean, 1999b; Goering, 2000b; Weller, 2000b) . Although PGFE is considered a reliable, discriminatory, and reproducible method, it is expensive and time consuming, making this technique difficult for hospitals to use as a routine form of support for infection-control practitioners in outbreak investigations (Weller, 2000a; Shopsin and Kreiswirth, 2001; Stranden et al., 2003) . Due to testing conditions, there is inherent gel-to-gel variability with PGFE, which makes it difficult to compare inter-institutional electrophoresis results. Public health laboratories have standardized PFGE for use in outbreak investigations, and digital imaging has provided some standardization and cross-gel comparative properties; still, the technique is relatively cumbersome and not practical in most hospital laboratories. With recent CDC and JCAHO recommendations to use molecular testing as the gold standard in investigation of hospital-acquired infections, hospitals are faced with difficult choices, referring specimens to reference laboratories or state public health laboratories for testing or investment in hospital-based infrastructure to support genotyping. Currently, there is a gap in our ability to provide results of molecular epidemiology in the hands of most clinical microbiologists and infection-control practitioners.",

The rep-PCR method exploits the presence of repetitive elements dispersed throughout the chromosomes of ORSA and other organisms. Repetitive elements have different and specific positions within the genome among different strains of microorganisms. Primers, designed to amplify genetic regions between these repetitive elements, allow for generation of PCR amplification products of various sizes (Woods et al., 1993) . Electrophoresis of the differently sized products, derived from different organisms strains, produces unique gel-banding pattern fingerprints, by which the strains can be compared and differentiated. Recent advancements and improvements to commercial rep-PCR fragment analysis using capillary electrophoresis (Bacterial Bar Codes, Inc., Atlanta, CA, USA) enables standardized and reproducible performance of rep-PCR and may provide a promising option for a rapid and cost-effective outbreak investigation in hospitals and communities.",

Commercially available tests for ORSA include latex agglutination tests for PBP2a (the product of mecA), cycle probe technology, and PCR for the detection of mecA in S. aureus. PCR has been used to detect and track both ORSA and VRE (Clark et al.,1993; Gordts et al. 1995; Aarestrup et al., 1996; Satake et al., 1997; Hussain et al., 2000; Padiglione et al., 2000; Grisold et al., 2002; Jonas et al., 2002; Louie et al., 2002; Maes et al., 2002; Francois et al., 2003; Strommenger et al., 2003; Sloan et al., 2004) , A review by Diekema et al. (2004) highlights the fact that together, ORSA and VRE are the two most important resistant pathogens in U.S. hospitals, and their rapid detection remains a need. Antimicrobial resistance is continuing to increase worldwide. With active surveillance and proper isolation of infected patients, use of rapid PCR technology could play an important role in identifying carriers upon hospital admission and aide in the prevention and control efforts for ORSA and VRE. For routine use of these tests, not only would they have to be sensitive and specific, but they would also have to be cost effective with proven infection prevention studies.",

Thus, it important to retain specimens or inoculate a culture until the laboratory can be sure a result is negative and the specimen can be discarded (Diekema et al., 2004) .

Mass spectroscopy (MS) and 2-D gel electrophoresis are the 2 common techniques in microbial proteomics (Douglas, 2004) . In 2-D gel electrophoresis, proteins are first separated by their isoelectric point (pI) in glass tubes (Bjellqvist et al., 1982) . Gels are then removed from glass and placed horizontally on top of polyacrylamide slab gels, and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) further separates proteins with similar charges by their size (molecular weight). Gel electrophoresis is a simple method to catalogue microbial proteins grown under different conditions and disease states. A mass spectrometer can take proteins from PAGE and further separate them by producing charged particles (ions) (Shevchenko et al., 1996) . The mass spectrometer differentially moves ionized molecules, separated by their mass-tocharge (m/z) ratio, through a vacuum by means of an electromagnetic field. For the sake of discussion, if one assumes that each component of the mixture has a different molecular weight, then the mass spectrum contains unique \"peaks\" for each compound that is present. For more information about the different types of mass spectroscopy, refer to Douglas (2004) .",

In one report, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectroscopy (MALDI-TOF-MS) was used to rapidly identify fungal proteins that evoked a specific human immune response, which may prove to be linked to active infection and outcome (Pitarch et al., 2004) . In another study, MALDI-TOF-MS, gelelectrophoresis, and tandem mass spectrometry were used to identify intra-amniotic proteins, which could lead to discovery of novel human biomarkers for human intra-amniotic infection (Gravett et al., 2004) . Ultimately, these tools will help to elucidate the interaction of proteins with protein precursors, DNA, and mRNA to add to the understanding of pathogenesis and disease. Out of this understanding, novel biomarkers for early detection of disease or disease outcomes are expected to occur.",

Identification of bacterial, viral, fungal, and parasitic genomes drives the emergence of new technologies to identify pathogens more rapidly, but limitations in the single target approach still exist. Miniaturization of robotics and automation will allow even small health care facilities to implement molecular methods. New discoveries in the human genome, linking disease susceptibility with infection, or human mutations with antibiotic utility, will certainly continue to impact the clinical laboratory of the next 10 years, broadening the scope of clinical microbiology from that of detection to include prediction, via protein or nucleic acid targets. Finally, miniaturization of techniques such as mass spectroscopy of PCR amplicon could change the entire face of clinical microbiology, in that multiple pathogens could be amplified or simultaneously detected and genotyped to allow rapid detection of many emerging pathogens and other infections.",
