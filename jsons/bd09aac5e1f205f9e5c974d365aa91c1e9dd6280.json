In addition to handling this parasitic disease, HCQ is also used to treat a number of autoimmune disorders including rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus when other medications are not effective. Recently a new viral infection (COVID-19) is rocking the entire world so much that it has already taken more than 200,000 lives throughout the world within the last two months and the World Health Organization was forced to declare it as a pandemic on March 11, 2020. Interestingly, some reports indicate that this wonder drug may be also beneficial for COVID-19 and accordingly, many clinical trials have begun. Here, we discuss different modes of action (anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, inhibition of endosomal acidification, suppression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 or ACE2 glycosylation, etc.) of HCQ that might be responsible for its possible anti-COVID-19 effect. On the other hand, this review also makes an honest attempt to delineate mechanisms (increase in vasoconstriction, inhibition of autophagy, depletion of T cells, etc.) indicating how it may aggravate certain conditions and why caution should be taken before granting widespread repurposing of HCQ for COVID-19.",

Based on the sequence similarity (~96% with bat coronaviruses), it has been suggested that COVID-19 is initiated from bat to human transmission or through an intermediary source (Stower 2020; Wu et al. 2020 ). This disease originated in China has now spread to most countries in the world. Common symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath. Although anyone can get the disease, those over 60 or with preexisting conditions, such as hypertension, obesity, asthma, or diabetes, are more likely to suffer from severe symptoms (Ledford 2020) . With a mortality rate of around 4-5%, COVID-19 is more than 10 times deadlier than the flu. Until now, no effective therapy is available for this global pandemic.",

            "text": "Although quinine, isolated from the bark of cinchona tree in 1820, is the first approved medication for malaria, Peruvians used extracts of cinchona bark as fever remedies about 400 years back. In some places, cinchona bark extract is still used for malaria, mild influenza, common cold, and swine flu. Chloroquine (CQ) was developed in 1940s as an anti-malarial drug and a substitute for quinine. Later on, a less toxic and a safer derivative of CQ was generated, known as hydroxychloroquine (HCQ). Both CQ and HCQ are widely used medications to treat malaria. In addition to malaria, HCQ is also used for rheumatoid arthritis and lupus (Rempenault et al. 2020; Schrezenmeier and Dorner 2020) . Accordingly, WHO has listed HCQ in the 2017 Model List of Essential Medicines as one of the most effective, safe, and economical drugs needed for basic healthcare. Recently, without any successful randomized controlled trials, HCQ is being used to treat and prevent COVID-19 (Principi and Esposito 2020; Taccone et al. 2020) . Therefore, we have devoted the following sections to analyze the molecular modes of actions of HCQ in light of the pros and cons of HCQ therapy in COVID-19.",

However, sometimes, when inflammation is initiated, it goes beyond control leading to prolonged inflammation to secrete a wide range of proinflammatory molecules that ultimately cause tissue damage and death. It is becoming clear that a subgroup of patients with severe COVID-19 symptoms suffer from cytokine storm and broad-spectrum inflammatory events (Mehta et al. 2020) . It has been shown that COVID-19 patients in the ICU have higher plasma levels of interleukin-2 (IL-2), IL-7, granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (GSCF), interferon-\u03b3 inducible protein 10 (IP-10), monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP1), macrophage inflammatory protein 1-\u03b1 (MIP1-\u03b1), and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) as compared to non-ICU patients ). According to Chen et al. (Chen et al. 2020) , severe COVID-19 cases more frequently have dyspnea, lymphopenia, and hypoalbuminemia, with higher levels of alanine aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase, C-reactive protein, ferritin, and D-dimer as well as markedly higher levels of IL-2R, IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-\u03b1. Therefore, controlling proinflammatory cytokines may be beneficial for COVID-19 patients in the ICU. Interestingly, HCQ treatment has been shown to control the overproduction of IL-1\u03b2 and GM-CSF in acute rheumatic fever (Kim et al. 2018) and to reduce the level of IL-6 in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (Batun-Garrido et al. 2018 ).",

Interestingly, CQ inhibits the activation of p38MAPK to inhibit the induction of proinflammatory cytokines in THP-1 cells (Seitz et al. 2003) . Moreover, NADPH oxidase (NOX2), a multimeric complex of gp91phox, p67phox, p47phox, p22phox, and small G protein Rac, catalyzes the production of superoxide to play an important role in oxidative stress and inflammation (Bylund et al. 2010 ). The gp91phox is the catalytic subunit of NOX2 and interestingly, HCQ attenuates the translocation of gp91phox to the membrane (Muller-Calleja et al. 2017) , leading to the inhibition of oxidative stress and proinflammatory signaling pathways. Therefore, CQ/HCQ treatment may be beneficial for COVID-19 patients via its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties ( Fig. 1) .",

On the other hand, HCQ, being a weak base, accumulates within acidic vesicles, such as endosome and lysosome, increases the pH and halts the pH-dependent endosome-mediated viral entry. Khan et al. (Khan et al. 2010 ) have demonstrated that prior treatment with CQ significantly protects Vero cells against Chikungunya virus through the prevention of endocytosis and/or endosomal acidification. Accordingly, in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, CQ exhibits efficacy in lowering the viral load and treating dengue in Vietnamese adults (Tricou et al. 2010) . In case of SARS-CoV-1, Wang et al. have shown that the fusion of viral and endosomal membranes leading to the release of the viral genome into the cytosol occurs at acidic pH (Wang et al. 2008 ). In recent cell culture studies, both CQ and HCQ also efficiently reduces SARS-CoV-2 infection (Liu et al. 2020a) . Therefore, HCQ is expected to increase endosomal pH and lower viral load in patients with COVID-19 (Fig. 2) .",

This is a cell surface receptor, and lung, heart and kidney are very rich in ACE2 (Zaman et al. 2002) . However, recently, ACE2 came to the forefront due to another reason and that is the requirement of this receptor by COVID-19 for entering into host cells. COVID-19 binds to ACE2 via the S protein on its surface, which is cleaved into S1 and S2 subunits during infection. Since S1 contains the receptor-binding domain, this subunit permits COVID-19 to directly attach to the peptidase domain of ACE2 (Ledford 2020; Stower 2020) . Now, being a membrane receptor, ACE2 needs to be glycosylated to go to the membrane and be active. However, HCQ treatment inhibits glycosylation of ACE2 receptors and thereby prevents COVID-19 from binding to the receptor and its entry into host cells (Fig. 2) . Although debatable, this mechanism also suggests that HCQ may have a prophylactic effect since it would reduce the chances of COVID-19 infection.",

This beneficial heptapeptide (Ang1-7) functions through its receptor Mas to exhibit vasodilatory/antiproliferative activities (Wang et al. 2012) . Moreover, Ang1-7 is also capable of inhibiting myocardial NADPH oxidase leading to a decrease in myocardial oxidative stress and inflammation (Bodiga et al. 2011) . Therefore, ACE2 is considered as a negative regulator of AngII-induced myocardial hypertrophy, fibrosis, and diastolic dysfunction. It has been demonstrated that the deletion of the ACE2 gene in mouse results in abnormal heart function (Oudit et al. 2007 ). ACE2-deficient mice also exhibit increased level of AngII in plasma and heart leading to cardiac dysfunction (Yamamoto et al. 2006; Oudit et al. 2007 ). Accordingly, recombinant human ACE2 also displays beneficial effects in a clinically relevant model of pressure-overload induced heart failure (Basu et al. 2017) . Therefore, in general, inhibition of ACE2 leads to an increase in vaconstrictor and a decrease in vasodilator, ultimately increasing the chances of inducing and/or aggravating cardiovascular diseases such as heart attacks, stroke, or arrhythmia. As a result, by suppressing ACE2, HCQ may pose risks for patients with preexisting cardiovascular issues. SARS-CoV causes the phosphorylation and activation of p38 mitogenactivated protein kinase (p38). Then activated p38 causes the activation of classical heterodimeric (p65:p50) NF-\u03baB, a proinflammatory transcription factor. Together with activated p300 (a proinflammatory histone acetyl transferase), the NF-\u03baB then binds to the promoter of different genes ultimately leading to the transcription and production of different proinflammatory molecules (e.g. tumor necrosis factor alpha or TNF\u03b1, interleukin-1\u03b2 or IL-1\u03b2, etc.). HCQ inhibits the phosphorylation of p38 to attenuate the production of different proinflammatory cytokines. Again, activation of NADPH oxidase (a pentameric complex of gp91phox, p67phox, p47phox, p22phox, and Rac) produces superoxide radicals to cause oxidative stress and the activation of NF-\u03baB for inflammation. HCQ prevents the translocation of gp91phox to the membrane and thereby inhibits the activation of NADPH oxidase to reduce oxidative stress and inflammation",

Accordingly, as expected, decreased IFN-\u03b3 expression in CD4 + T cells are associated with severe COVID-19 cases (Pedersen and Ho 2020) . In addition to T cells, number of B cells and natural killer (NK) cells also decrease in COVID-19 patients with severe cases than mild ones . Therefore, maintaining the homeostasis and classical functions of T cells is important for the recovery of severe COVID-19 patients. However, according to Landewe et al. (Landewe et al. 1995) , CQ inhibits the proliferation of T cells at least partly through interfering with the production of IL-2 protein and the induction of IL-2 mRNA. Accordingly, by attenuating T cell proliferation, CQ/HCQ may exhibit adverse effect on severe COVID-19 patients (Fig. 3b) . In addition to removing dead cells, autophagy is expected to clear Lewy body pathology in Parkinson's disease (PD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and multiple system atrophy (MSA). Autophagy is also important in lowering plaques and tangles in Alzheimers's disease (AD), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and reducing huntingtin inclusions in Huntington's disease (HD). Since aging is the most important risk factor of these neurodegenerative disorders and aged people are also more susceptible to COVID-19, it is possible that HCQ Fig. 3 Possible deleterious effects of HCQ. a ACE2 catalyzes the production of angiotensin 1-7 (a vasodilator) from angiotensin 2 (a vasoconstrictor). The ACE2 receptor needs to be glycosylated to be active. HCQ can inhibit glycosylation and therefore inactivate the receptor, ultimately causing greater amount of vasoconstrictor to remain active. This can potentially be harmful for patients with hypertension and cardiovascular problems. b IL-2 is needed for T cell proliferation. This allows the immune system to fight off viral infections. HCQ can decrease the proliferation of T cells via inhibiting the production of IL-2, ultimately affecting the body's anti-viral immunity. c By increasing the endosomal pH, HCQ decreases autophagy. Therefore, damaged cell components and proteins would aggregate and this can increase the risk of neurodegenerative disorders in which abnormal protein aggregation is the cardinal feature HCQ in COVID-19 Fig. 4 Balance between helpful and harmful effects of HCQ for COVID-19 lysosomal storage disorders (LSD) and decrease in autophagy to any extent (Ballabio and Bonifacino 2020) by HCQ will be detrimental in patients with LSD and may be detrimental even in the carriers of LSD.",

Moreover, oxidative stress and inflammation are important pathological aspects of many human disorders, which are also seen in COVID-19 cases. HCQ is also right there to take care of these two comorbid issues. However, by inhibiting the function of ACE2, this so-called miracle drug may augment vasoconstriction and worsen cardiovascular problems in persons with preexisting hypertension, obesity and heart disease. This is an important issue as hypertension and obesity are very common in USA. Loss of T cells has become an important feature of severe COVID-19 patients suffering from acute respiratory problems. Since HCQ inhibits the proliferation of T cells, it may not bring good news for COVID-19 patients who are in the ICU. Moreover, the aged population is more susceptible to COVID-19 severity than the younger ones.

It is crucial for the endosomal pH to be low so that old damaged cells can be removed during autophagy. However, a number of studies have shown that CQ and HCQ can interfere lysosomal function and autophagy at multiple steps(Sundelin and Terman 2002;Frustaci et al. 2012; Mauthe et al. 2018). Lysosomal pH plays a critical for lysosomal enzymes to be active in hydrolysis. It has been demonstrated that CQ and HCQ increase the pH of endosomal compartments to weaken the maturation of lysosomes and autophagosomes(Fox and  Kang 1993; Mauthe et al. 2018). Palmitoyl-protein thioesterase 1 (PPT1) is an enzyme involved in the catabolism of lipid-modified proteins and Rebecca et al. (Rebecca et al. 2019) have described that HCQ can bind and inhibit PPT1 activity.",
