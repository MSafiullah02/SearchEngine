The aim of this study was to determine the activity of influenza and influenza-like viruses in individuals aged over of 14 in Poland during the 2015/2016 epidemic season. A total of 5070 specimens taken from patients were analyzed. The presence of the influenza virus was confirmed in 40.2% of cases, among which the subtype A/H1N1/pdm09 (62.6% positive samples) predominated. The analysis of confirmed influenza and influenza-like viruses in individuals divided into four age-groups demonstrate that the highest morbidity was reported for the age ranges: 45-64 (13.1%) and 26-44 (12.6%) years. An increase in the number of influenza type B cases (23.7% positive samples), which was the main cause of morbidity in the age group 15-25 years, was noticeable. Given the epidemiological and virological data, the 2015/2016 season in Poland was characterized by increased activity of the influenza virus compared to the previous season. In the 2015/2016 season, there were more than 3.8 million cases and suspected cases of influenza and influenza-like illness, more than 15,000 hospitalizations, and up to 140 deaths.",

            "text": "Influenza is an infectious viral disease of the respiratory system, caused by influenza viruses belonging to Orthomyxoviridae. There are three types of the influenza virus: A, B and C, among which infections caused by type C are asymptomatic. In every epidemic season, infections are induced by influenza virus type A and B, with usually a different course of illness for either type of virus, which also depends on the patient's age and the immune system's efficiency (Brydak 2008) . Influenza A virus is divided into subtypes, depending on the combination of the surface antigens hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). There are 18 types of HA and 11 types of NA described (Wu et al. 2014) . Improperly treated infections caused by influenza viruses can lead to complications and consequently to death. Therefore, it is important to confirm the presence of influenza virus in a short period of time, using molecular biology methods (Bednarska et al. 2016b) , which enables to apply antiviral drugs, i.e., neuraminidase inhibitors, soon after onset of symptoms (Fiore et al. 2011; Brydak 2008) .",

However, the number of hospitalizations and deaths due to complications increased dramatically. The number of deaths increased from 11 in 2014/ 2015 to 140 in 2015/2016 (Table 1) .

A particular attention should be paid to the A/California/7/2009(H1N1)pdm09 strain which was a vaccine component since the 2010/ 2011 season, and also caused most influenza cases in persons over 14 years of age in the currently evaluated season. Given that the percentage of vaccinated population in this age range in Poland ranks at a dismally low level and has a decreasing trend from 1.95% in 2011 to 1.37% in 2015 (Epimeld 2016) , it can be judged that that the recorded number of influenza cases reflects the immunodeficiency to this viral strain (Brydak 2015) .",

The death as a sequelae of influenza was due usually to complications arising from the underlying chronic comorbidities, especially cardiovascular and respiratory disorders that ended up in fulminant pneumonia. The present findings of 40.2% of confirmed cases of influenza and influenza-like viruses in the 2015/2016 influenza season show a near doubling of laboratory confirmations compared with past seasons (Bednarska et al. 2016b; Bednarska et al. 2015) . That result points to substantial improvements in infection surveillance and imbued nuances in the virological and epidemiological procedures despite a drastically low and inexplicably decreasing percentage of adult, mostly middle-aged, population getting vaccinated against influenza each epidemic season in Poland. The virological data presented in this article seek to call repeat attention to the need to vaccinate against influenza as the most effective method of preventing the infection and its severe complications, death included; a need advocated by the WHO, major medical societies, and 142 National Influenza Centers worldwide.",
