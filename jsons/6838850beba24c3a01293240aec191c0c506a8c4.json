These principles appear to be sound. The potential for prolonged virus excretion by immunocompromised patients requires further definition, although there is no epidemiologic evidence of a threat to eradication. Survival of poliovirus in the environment is highly variable, but viral inactivation is usually complete within months. Higher primates may be infected with poliovirus, but they are unlikely reservoirs in nature. The only poliovirus reservoir remaining after eradication will be laboratory stocks. Serious attention must be given to reducing this potential source of infection. Polio eradication through immunization is evidenced by the documented absence of poliomyelitis in an increasing number of countries and the progressive disappearance of poliovirus genotypes.",

Polio vaccine has been successfully used to eliminate indigenous poliomyelitis in multiple countries, including the entire Americas. Key to global eradication are the assumptions that poliovirus causes acute, nonpersistent infections, virus is transmitted only by infectious humans or their waste, survival of virus in the environment is finite, humans are the only reservoir, and immunization with polio vaccine interrupts virus transmission. Here we review the biologic basis for these assumptions.",

In one study of 198 consecutive adult patients admitted to the internal medicine ward in a Kinshasa hospital, only rotavirus, coronavirus, adenovirus, and small round structured viruses were detected [12] . Of these patients, 57% were HIV-positive and, among the HIV-positive patients, 50% were classified as WHO AIDS stage IV. In this study, HIV-positive patients tended to shed virus more frequently, but there was no significant difference between HIV-positive and HIV-negative patients in the prevalence of enteric viruses in stool specimens. The short life expectancy and the predominant T cell deficiency of severely immunocompromised HIVpositive patients argues against the risk of prolonged poliovirus excretion. However, the frequency and duration of poliovirus excretion (wild and vaccine-like) among HIV-positive and other immunocompromised persons, especially children, should be further investigated. The findings from such studies have important implications for when and how to stop vaccination with oral polio vaccine (OPV) after eradication of wild poliovirus.",

The exceptional stability of enteroviruses in the frozen state often has led to speculation of poliovirus overwintering in snow, frozen soil, or the ice of contaminated surface waters. Arguments against overwintering being a major factor in persistence of poliovirus are the absence of epidemiologic evidence and the qualitative differences between the frozen state in the laboratory and that in nature. Unlike the relatively stable conditions ofthe laboratory freezer, there are wide swings in temperature and humidity in cold climates. Repeated temperature changes, particularly freezing and thawing, and desiccation have a profound deleterious effect on virus survival.",

Evidence does not favor such speculation. In 1951, an American expedition was unsuccessful in recovering influenza virus from the lungs of several persons exhumed from the Alaskan permafrost who had died during the 1918 influenza pandemic [38] . More recently, attempts in Siberia to recover smallpox virus from the\" bodies of persons who died of smallpox unearthed by a river changing course were also unsuccessful [39] . The recovery of poliovirus from cadavers buried for many years in the permafrost is unlikely. Natural biologic deterioration is slowed but not suspended under such conditions. In summary, poliovirus in the environment is the direct result of recent poliovirus infections in the human community. The rate of poliovirus inactivation is dependent on numerous condi-tions, but survival in the environment is finite. Interpolation of the available data indicates that poliovirus infectivity decreases by 90% in soil every 20 days in winter and every 1.5 days in summer, in sewage every 26 days at 23\u00b0C, in fresh water every 5.5 days at ambient temperatures, and in seawater every 2.5 days under the same conditions.",

Conversely, through the natural oral/intestinal route, humans are more susceptible to poliovirus than are chimpanzees, and chimpanzees are more susceptible than are monkeys [49, 50] . Infections of monkeys by the oral route are often unpredictable and may be related to dietary and other conditions as well as the passage history of the challenge virus [51] . Many monkey species are markedly resistant to oral infection.

Because excretion of wild poliovirus is prevented or is brief and lowtiter in immunized persons, transmission dies out in highly immunized vaccinated populations [70] . WHO recommends that four doses of OPV be administered to all infants during routine immunizations [71] . In countries in which polio is endemic, extra doses of OPV are to be administered during national immunization days, which consist of double rounds of OPV administered annually to all children <5 years of age regardless ofimmunization status. In countries with focal transmission, OPV is administered as extra doses to all children < 5 years of age in high-risk foci [72] . Simultaneous administration of OPV to all children in a specified geographic area interrupts wild poliovirus circulation by boosting population immunity (particularly intestinal IgA levels) to the point that transmission cannot be sustained.",

Distinct genotypes sharing 85% nucleotide similarity within the VPII2A interval on the poliovirus genome tend to cluster geographically. A genotype is eliminated through immunization or when another predomi-Bating genotype is introduced. Eight poliovirus genotypes are believed to have been eradicated through vaccination in the Americas, four in China, and two in the Philippines. Genotypic diversity decreases as eradication approaches. Currently, three type 1 genotypes account for the greatest number of polio cases, primarily on the Indian subcontinent, in central and southwest Asia, and in West and central Africa. Wild polioviruses isolated in areas in which polio is not endemic have been identified by molecular methods as recent imports from endemic reservoirs within other countries or regions [74] .",

The source of poliovirus transmission is infectious humans. Survival ofpoliovirus in the environment is influenced by many factors, but even under the most favorable conditions, the virus is inactivated within months. Higher primates may be naturally infected with poliovirus, although they are unlikely reservoirs in nature. The only remaining poliovirus reservoir after eradication will be laboratory stocks, and serious attention must be given to reducing this potential source of infection. Evidence of poliovirus eradication through immunization is the increasing number of countries with no poliomyelitis and the progressive disappearance of poliovirus genotypes.",
