The inability to recreate the preparedness \"packages\" on the level witnessed within high income countries creates the need for an adapted response to save lives. Doctors Worldwide (3), a UK registered medical charity, was established in 2001 to improve the health of communities, addressing gaps in healthcare provision by means of low cost, high impact solutions.",

The checklists, which are freely available online, focus on preparedness for COVID-Journal Pre-proof J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 19 and are tailored to healthcare work in humanitarian and low resource settings. At present the checklists have reached both settings in 15 countries across Sub-Saharan and East Africa, South Asia, and the Middle East. Additional support is provided to offer hands-on training on the checklists' usage and in-country supervisory learning in various locations. The checklists are summarised in greater detail below.",
