The strength of a causal relationship varies greatly, and in some cases only case reports have been published. The most common cause of nontraumatic osteonecrosis is corticosteroid use, which was first described in 1957.11 Although other adverse effects of corticosteroids are perhaps better known, osteonecrosis of the femoral head is one of the more serious complications. Clearly there exist individual susceptibility differences that are not predictive, and therefore it is important that steroids be prescribed only when indicated and only for the length of time required. As will be discussed, although it is safe for some people to take large doses of steroids for long periods, avascular necrosis will develop in other patients who take smaller doses over shorter periods.",

Because several forms of corticosteroids exist with differing potencies and half-lives, and because dosages and duration of use vary between studies, any conclusions about a \u201csafe\u201d dose of corticosteroids are fraught with potential confounding variables and errors. In a study of 20 patients diagnosed with stage 1 osteonecrosis by MRI, the interval between the use of steroids and diagnosis ranged from 1 to 16 months.12 The cumulative dose of steroids in this study ranged from 1800 to 15,505 mg (mean, 5928 mg) of prednisolone or the equivalent. In other studies, cumulative doses of steroids associated with osteonecrosis ranged from 48013 to 432014 mg of dexamethasone dose equivalence. In a 2010 article, Powell and colleagues15 collectively analyzed the available literature to derive maximum safe levels for duration, maximum daily dose, and average daily dose of corticosteroids. The study confirmed that many other confounding variables affect the development of osteonecrosis, making analysis of dose-response risk for an isolated association difficult. Nonetheless, corticosteroid-induced osteonecrosis is dependent on dosage, and the risk is higher with long-acting steroids and with parenteral usage.",

The incidence of osteonecrosis in a group of patients receiving glucocorticoid replacement therapy for primary or secondary adrenal insufficiency was 2.4%. In a study of patients undergoing renal transplantation, the 26 patients in whom osteonecrosis developed had taken a higher cumulative oral dose of prednisone after 1 and 3 months compared with 28 control patients undergoing renal transplantation in whom osteonecrosis did not develop.16 A separate study estimated the incidence of osteonecrosis in patients undergoing renal transplant to be 5%.17 No consistent evidence links the use of topical, inhaled, or nasal corticosteroids to osteonecrosis. The evidence for an association between osteonecrosis and intramuscular or intra-articular corticosteroids is limited to case reports.18 Parenteral use poses a higher risk because of the rapid absorption and longer half-life of the drugs used. Bisphosphonate-induced osteonecrosis of the jaw is particularly interesting because the intended beneficial use of bisphosphonates with regard to bone diseases instead leads to a serious bone complication itself.19, 20, 21\n",

It was also found that liver damage is not necessary for the development of osteonecrosis in patients who consume alcohol, although elevated liver enzymes may be present.25 The incidence of osteonecrosis in patients who received treatment for alcoholism was 5.3%. The femoral head was again the most common site (representing 82 of 92 lesions), with the other 10 lesions in the humeral head.26\n",

In osteonecrosis of the femoral hip, the pain is located in the hip joint but may radiate to the groin, anterior thigh, or knee. The severity of the pain can vary, depending on the size of the infarct and whether the onset of disease is insidious or sudden. When sudden and severe disruption of blood flow occurs in trauma, and when large infarcts occur in the presence of Gaucher's disease, dysbarism, or hemoglobinopathy, pain can be intense and sudden. In other conditions with a more insidious onset, the pain can follow a gradual and slow incremental progression. The pain of osteonecrosis is usually increased with use of the joint, but in individuals with advanced disease, the pain can be persistent at rest. Limitation of range of motion is progressive and is usually a late symptom, except when it results from accompanying pain. The risk of developing osteonecrosis of the contralateral hip when one side is affected ranges from 31% to 55%.",

Although arterial flow was normal, venous drainage was significantly disrupted.97 This disturbance was reproduced in a dog model in which injection of silicone was used to obstruct venous flow distal to the hip.98 Ischemia resulted from the obstruction to venous drainage, leading to a cessation of endochondral ossification in the preosseous epiphyseal cartilage and the physeal plate. Widening of the joint space ensued, followed by revascularization of the epiphysis and deposition of new, immature bone. A weakened or unstable femoral epiphyseal plate resulted, and the subchondral bone became prone to segmental collapse and fracture.99\n",

Diseases such as osteopetrosis and osteoporosis are a result of a dysfunction in the balance between bone deposition and bone resorption. The factors that regulate this homeostasis include cells of the bone matrix, immune cells, signaling molecules, cytokines and chemokines, and vitamins and hormones. Some of these regulatory factors may be present on both bone cells and immune cells, often serving different functions, thereby providing a link between the immune system and bone. Osteonecrosis, in fact, may be a result of such an imbalance in bone homeostasis. Immune factors may affect surrounding soft tissue as well, contributing to the development of osteonecrosis.

Typical diagnostic ultrasound transducers generally deliver intensities ranging between 0.1 to 100 W/cm2, although HIFU has been studied for use in cancer and can reach 100 to 10,000 W/cm2. This finding raises the possibility of ultrasound-induced osteonecrosis in humans in real-life clinical settings, although this possibility is far from substantiated.126 The proposed mechanism by which ultrasound can induce osteonecrosis is through thermal damage induced by osteocyte damage and vascular thrombosis.",

Kenzora and Glimcher133 were the first to introduce the concept of cumulative stress. Corticosteroid-induced osteonecrosis seems to occur with greater frequency in patients who have significant underlying illness such as systemic lupus erythematosus134 or transplantation and less frequently or never in patients who are not chronically ill but are taking steroids for an acute event such as a head injury. Recent observations that corticosteroids induce osteonecrosis in patients with SARS further support the notion that more than one insult to the bone or surrounding tissue may be necessary to precipitate osteonecrosis. For each of the known associations of osteonecrosis, different mechanisms may predominate, such as lipid anomalies and apoptosis of osteoblasts in steroid-induced osteonecrosis, as well as elevated intraosseous pressures and coagulation abnormalities in dysbaric osteonecrosis, but additional factors may be necessary to precipitate osteonecrosis. The accumulated cell stress theory suggests that when the damaging effects of multiple events are aligned, similar to the Swiss-cheese model of risk assessment,135, 136 the involved bone is unable to recover from the chronic stress and osteonecrosis ensues.",

The frequency of the 4a/b allele was found to be higher in all types of osteonecrosis when compared with control subjects.

Several pathways exist for epigenetic transformation, including DNA methylation and demethylation, histone modifications such as acetylation and deacetylation, and microRNAs. MicroRNAs are short 21- to 23-nucleotide RNA molecules that bind to messenger RNA of the promoter region of genes and serve a regulatory function. Overexpression of certain microRNAs therefore may affect the expression of genes coding for various mediators of disease, such as cytokines or growth factors. In 2012, Yamasaki and colleagues150 demonstrated that microRNA-210 is upregulated in the cells surrounding osteonecrotic bone. Furthermore, microRNA-210 is known to play a role in angiogenesis. Accompanying the upregulation of microRNA-210 in patients with osteonecrosis were also increased expression of VEGF and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and -7 when compared with patients who had osteoarthritis.150\n",

The investigators found that expression of this microRNA was lower in patients who had osteonecrosis compared with patients who had osteoarthritis. This finding was accompanied by a facilitation in the differentiation of HMSC-bm cells, which is thought to be mediated by the action of microRNA-17-5p on expression of \u03b2-catenin and a subsequent increase in COL1A1.153 MicroRNA profiles identified 27 microRNAs that were differentially expressed in patients with osteonecrosis of the femoral head.

In a rabbit model for steroid-induced osteonecrosis, siRNAs targeting PPAR\u03b3 were able to reduce levels of PPAR\u03b3 expression and increase levels of Runx2 and osteocalcin in rabbits treated with dexamethasone plus a recombinant adenovirus shuttle vector carrying an siRNA targeting PPAR\u03b3, compared with rabbits treated with dexamethasone alone. Treatment with dexamethasone plus the recombinant adenovirus shuttle vector led to amelioration of the marrow necrosis, adipocyte hypertrophy and proliferation, diminished hematopoiesis, thinner and sparse trabeculae, and an increased number of empty osteocyte lacunae in the femoral head seen in rabbits that only received dexamethasone or in combination with an irrelevant shuttle vector.155 These studies, although in their early stages, offer hope for novel treatments based on pathogenesis and the physiologic and cellular derangements that are risk factors for the development of osteonecrosis.",

The earliest radiographic sign of osteonecrosis is the presence of a radiolucent crescent-shaped rim along the contour of the femoral head (the crescent sign) (Figure 103-3\n). This appearance on radiographs is the result of structural collapse of a necrotic segment of subchondral trabecular bone. At this stage, the disease is already irreversible. Later, radiographs will begin to show sclerotic changes (Figure 103-4\n). The appearance of radiographic \u201cdensity\u201d is secondary to compression of bone trabeculae after microfracture of the nonviable bone, calcification of detritic marrow, and repair of the necrotic area by deposition of new bone, the so-called \u201ccreeping substitution.\u201d Flattening of the articular surface of bone is a sign of further bone collapse (Figure 103-5\n).

Therefore the MRI signal of the necrotic area is often very heterogeneous (see Figure 103-8), and as a result, this classification is of little clinical value. The low signal intensity band in the periphery of the osteonecrotic area correlates with a sclerotic band seen on radiographs and CT and often has a serpiginous appearance.

The first is estimating head involvement. This method was first proposed by Steinberg and colleagues163 in 1984, and it is defined by the appearance of abnormal signals on T1-weighted images. The degree of head involvement was classified into three categories: less than 15%, 15% to 30%, and greater than 30%. The second method used to evaluate the extent of involvement is the index of necrotic extent, which is determined by measuring the angle created by the extent of subchondral involvement. Lesion size was estimated using a \u201cnecrotic arc angle,\u201d defined by the angle of the arc of the necrotic segment from the center of the femoral head. Two angles are obtained: \u201cA,\u201d representing the necrotic arc seen on midcoronal images, and \u201cB,\u201d representing the necrotic arc angle seen on midsagittal images. The index is a compilation of these two angles. The third method is a variation of the second, in which the angle is identified not on midcoronal or midsagittal images but on the image that shows the maximum lesion size in the sagittal and coronal planes. It is thought that this method would correct for the underestimation that may be inherent in the second method.",

At the onset of the disease, range of motion may be well preserved but gradually deteriorates over time. In the early stages of the disease, when it is still reversible, patients may be asymptomatic; many patients therefore present with advanced disease. Although spontaneous resolution of femoral head osteonecrosis can occur, it is rare and occurs only when the lesion size is small. A study of the prognosis of osteonecrosis of the femoral head as a function of symptoms (pain) and radiographic findings showed that in patients who were asymptomatic and had normal radiographs, progression of the disease was slow, with only 1 of 23 hips progressing to pain and radiographic changes after 5 years. When radiographic changes are already present, disease progresses to pain in 14 of 19 patients after 5 years. In a study of stage 1 osteonecrotic lesions of the hip diagnosed with MRI, 40 patients were followed up for an average of 11 years. All patients had stage 1 lesions on the contralateral hip. Overall, 35 of the 40 stage 1 hips became symptomatic, and 29 hips showed collapse. The mean interval between diagnosis and collapse was 92 months, whereas the mean interval between symptoms and diagnosis was 80 months. Most stage 1 hips eventually progress to a more advanced stage, requiring surgery, and thus these hips should be monitored closely.",

In a study of 55 consecutive hip arthroplasty procedures, cementless total hip arthroplasty was shown to provide favorable results in advanced-stage osteonecrosis of the femoral head. Although 10 of the 48 hips available for follow-up after a minimum of 5 years required revision, all of these patients had Ficat and Arlet stage 3 or 4 disease. A study of 53 hips in 41 patients treated with cemented total hip replacement showed that at a minimum of 10 years of follow-up, 17.4% required revision. Compared with cemented total hip replacements performed for other conditions, osteonecrosis had a greater risk for loosening of acetabular and femoral components. A survivorship analysis of cemented total hip replacements in renal transplant patients with osteonecrosis of the femoral head showed excellent survival after 10 years (98.8%). After 20 years, the survival rate decreased to 63.8%.",

Conservative medical treatment is effective only in the early stages for symptomatic relief. Nonsurgical management does not seem to alter the natural course of the disease. Electrical stimulation has been used in the treatment of osteonecrosis, in conjunction with core decompression. Electrical stimulation enhances osteogenesis and neovascularization. It also alters the balance between osteoblast and osteoclast activity, resulting in increased bone deposition and decreased bone resorption. Delivery of electrical stimulation can be performed by direct current (DC), pulsed electromagnetic field, and capacitance coupling. The success of electrical stimulation in the treatment of osteonecrosis has been rather mediocre. A study was performed of 11 hips in 8 patients with Ficat stage 2 osteonecrosis who underwent core decompression and placement of an electric stimulating coil within the core in the anterosuperior segment of the femoral head.183 Of these 11 hips, 5 required a repeat operation, and 6 had progressive deterioration 13 months after initial placement of the coil. In addition, there was little histologic evidence that the coil did indeed generate new bone deposition around itself. The efficacy of this method of treatment is unproven.",

Why is it that corticosteroid-induced osteonecrosis is more common in patients with certain underlying diseases and not in others? Does osteonecrosis have a genetic or epigenetic basis, and is there a familial predisposition? Common pathogenic mechanisms known to be involved in osteonecrosis include osteoblast/osteoclast survival and apoptosis, lipid metabolism, and coagulation abnormalities. However, it is still unclear how these mechanisms interrelate. To better appreciate the risk factors involved in osteonecrosis, a more complete understanding of the pathogenesis is necessary.
