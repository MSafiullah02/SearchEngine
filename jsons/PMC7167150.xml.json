[Izurieta et al., 2000; Fiore et al., 2009; Bezerra et al., 2011; Gessner et al., 2011; Munywoki et al., 2011]. However, information about the etiology of viral ARIs in preschool children, particularly in outpatients, is limited, especially in Latin America. Community respiratory viruses (CRVs) are frequently found in this population and could be involved in severe infections in young children and patients with comorbid conditions [Ampofo et al., 2006; Ampofo et al., 2008; Bender et al., 2009]. Therefore, understanding the dynamics of their circulation among various age groups is essential, not only to help pediatricians in their diagnosis but also for developing preventive measures against these infections.",

Five viruses (HRV, AdV, PIV, FLU, and CoV) were selected for a binomial analysis to assess the impact of viruses on the health of the children. The presence or absence of the virus was compared with different variables (demographic, clinical features, and host characteristics). The selection of these viruses was based on either the high frequency of infections or previously reported severity of infections caused by them. Only cases with mono\u2010detection were included in this evaluation. Variables with an associated P\u2010value < 0.2 in the univariate analysis were subjected to multivariate logistic regression to identify independent predictors of these viruses infection.

Human rhinovirus and adenovirus were the main viruses found in the 2 years following the pandemic. The profile of detected viruses was different from that previous reported, and viruses such as RSV were less frequent, while adenoviruses, which are generally associated with severe infections in hospitalized patients, were more frequently detected. This is probably due to differences in age groups, because previous studies with pediatric outpatients under 2 years old showed a pathogen profile similar to that of hospitalized children [Milstone et al., 2012; Hara et al, 2014; Adams et al., 2015]. \u00c7i\u00e7ek et al.

Similar to our results, in pediatric patients, they found that HRV was detected more frequently in outpatients, and RSV, in inpatients; however, the distribution of the detected viruses was not stratified according to age group. Moreover, diagnosis was based on antigen detection and virus isolation, which are less sensitive than the method used in this study. Likewise, Zimmerman et al.

First, vaccination coverage rates were high owing to the public immunization campaigns in 2010 and 2011: vaccination coverage in the studied age group in the city of Curitiba was almost 100% [Brazilian Health Ministry, 2011]. In addition, because of the magnitude of the 2009 pandemic in southern Brazil, the population can be considered sensitized during the study period. Second, the early use of oseltamivir might be a contributing factor. Third, a high rate of influenza A H1N1pdm09 infection was observed in 2010 [Libster et al., 2010], which might have led to a protective effect in many children during the subsequent season.",

The incidence of CRVs was higher in children attending school and/or day\u2010care centers; however, there was no significant difference in the amount of time spent in these places in the 2 years. Similar to previous reports, in both seasons, the most prevalent underlying conditions associated with CRV infection were asthma and wheezing crisis [Tregoning and Schwarze, 2010; Turunen et al., 2014]. X\u2010rays were performed in only 9% of the patients, and perihilar infiltrates were the most common radiologic findings, although none of the patients needed mechanical ventilation or intensive care treatment.",

            "text": "One of the main challenges in the care of patients with ARIs is to determine clinical and demographic factors that can help in the etiological diagnosis of this infection. For this reason, we selected five RVs that are often detected in ARIs and used logistic regression to evaluate correlations between their prevalence and various parameters. An association was observed between HRV and asthma, and between the presence of fever and hAdV and influenza infections. Similarly, previous reports have linked HRV to atopic characteristics, and the susceptibility to HRV\u2010induced wheezing has been recognized as an important risk factor for childhood asthma [Tregoning and Schwarze, 2010; Mackay et al., 2013; Turunen et al., 2014]. The strongest association was observed between fever and adenovirus and influenza infections, suggesting that screening for influenza by rapid tests would be recommended. As previously reported, children maintain the chain of transmission of influenza since they shed viruses for a more prolonged time and in higher concentrations; thus, control of these infections must be based on disease control in pediatric patients [Ploin et al., 2007; D'onise and Raupach, 2008; Fiore et al., 2009].",
