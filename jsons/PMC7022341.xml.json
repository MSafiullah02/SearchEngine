A decade later, the emergence and continued outbreaks of the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) further illustrate the ongoing threat posed by circulating zoonotic viruses (5).

During the MERS-CoV outbreak, our group and others were able to leverage reagents generated against related group 2C coronaviruses, namely, HKU4- and HKU5-CoV (6, 7). These reagents, created independent of viable virus replication, provided valuable insights and models for testing serologic responses during the early stages of the MERS-CoV outbreak. Similarly, reverse genetics systems permitted the exploration of zoonotic coronaviruses (8); using the known SARS spike/ACE2 receptor interaction, chimeric viruses containing the backbones of bat CoVs were generated to evaluate the efficacy of both vaccines and therapeutics (9\u201312). The inverse approach placed the zoonotic spike proteins in the context of the epidemic SARS-CoV backbone (13, 14). These studies provided insight into potential threats circulating in bats as well as the efficacy of current therapeutic treatments (15). While far from comprehensive, the results indicated that these approaches, reagents, and predictions may prove useful in preparations for future CoV outbreaks.",

            "text": "In this study, we extend the examination of zoonotic viruses to a novel MERS-like CoV strain isolated from a Ugandan bat, namely, PDF-2180 CoV (MERS-Uganda). Our initial attempt to cultivate a chimeric MERS-CoV containing the Ugandan MERS-like spike produced viral subgenomic transcripts but failed to result in infectious virus after electroporation (16). However, in the current study, we demonstrate that exogenous trypsin treatment produced high-titer virus capable of plaque formation and continued replication. These results are consistent with the recovery of enteric CoVs like porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (17) but have not previously been described as a major barrier for bat-derived CoVs. The chimeric Ugandan MERS-like spike virus could replicate efficiently in both Vero and Huh7 cells in the context of trypsin-containing media but failed to produce infection of either continuous or primary human respiratory cell cultures. Importantly, the MERS-Uganda chimeric virus successfully infected cells of the human digestive tract, potentially identifying another route for cross-species transmission and emergence. Notably, blockade of human DPP4, the receptor for MERS-CoV, had no significant impact on replication of the chimeric MERS-Uganda virus, suggesting the use of an alternative receptor. Similarly, the addition of trypsin also rescued replication of full-length HKU5-CoV, a related group 2C bat CoV, and showed no replication defect during DPP4 blockade. Together, the results indicate that proteolytic activation of the spike protein is a potent constraint to infection for zoonotic CoVs and expand the correlates for CoV emergence beyond receptor binding alone.",

Previously, MERS-CoV had been shown to replicate efficiently in Huh7 cells (21). In the Huh7 liver cell line, infection with MERS-Uganda RFP chimeric virus resulted in RFP-positive cells and cell fusion (Fig. 3A). In contrast, while a few RFP-positive cells were observed in the non-trypsin-treated group, neither expanding RFP expression nor cytopathic effect were seen in the absence of trypsin. Our observation may have been the result of residual trypsin activity from the undiluted virus stock, resulting in low-level infection. Exploring further, N protein analysis by Western blotting indicated that the PDF-2180 spike chimera could produce significant viral proteins in the presence of trypsin (Fig. 3B); only low levels of protein were observed in the control-treated infection. While replication of the MERS-Uganda chimera was not equivalent to that of wild-type MERS-CoV, the results clearly demonstrate the capacity of the PDF-2180 spike to mediate infection of human cells in the presence of trypsin.",

Using Calu3 cells, a human lung epithelial cell line, we observed robust replication of wild-type MERS-CoV based on RFP expression, consistent with previous studies (19). However, no evidence of infection was noted in MERS-Uganda-infected Calu3 cells in the presence or absence of trypsin. We subsequently explored infection of primary human airway epithelial (HAE) cultures. Grown on an air-liquid interface, HAE cultures have a propensity to facilitate improved infections of several human CoVs and may be more permissive for infection with the PDF-2180 spike chimera (22). To infect, PDF-2180 chimeric virus grown in the presence of trypsin was inoculated onto the apical surface of the HAE culture; cultures were subsequently washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 5 \u03bcg/ml trypsin at 0, 18, 24, and 48 hours postinfection for 10 minutes and then removed. Following infection, no evidence of RFP expression was observed even after trypsin washes of the apical surface (Fig. 3C). Similarly, RNA expression analysis found no evidence for accumulation of viral genomic RNA, indicating no evidence for replication in HAE cultures (Fig. 3D). In contrast, wild-type MERS-CoV efficiently infects these HAE cultures, as demonstrated by both RFP expression and viral genomic RNA accumulation. Together, the Calu3 and HAE results suggest that the PDF-2180 spike is unable to infect respiratory cells in humans, even in the presence of exogenous trypsin.",

While uncommon in humans, several animal CoVs have been shown to cause severe disease via the enteric pathway (23, 24). In addition, most bat CoV sequences, including PDF-2180-CoV, were isolated from bat guano samples, suggesting an enteric etiology. Importantly, the presence of trypsin and other soluble host proteases in the digestive tract may facilitate infection with the PDF-2180 spike in humans. To test this question, we infected Caco-2 cells, a human epithelial colorectal adenocarcinoma cell line, with wild-type MERS-CoV and MERS-Uganda spike chimera in the presence or absence of trypsin (Fig. 3E). For MERS-CoV, infection of Caco-2 cells resulted in robust infection and spread with or without trypsin in the media. For the MERS-Uganda chimera, the addition of trypsin facilitated infection with many RFP-positive Caco-2 cells; however, infection was not as robust as in the wild-type MERS-CoV infection. Examination of N protein by Western blotting indicated that the MERS-Uganda spike could produce infection in Caco-2 cells but confirmed replication at levels lower than that with wild-type MERS-CoV (Fig. 3F). Together, the results indicate that human cells, including gut cells, can support infection with the MERS-Uganda chimera in the presence of trypsin.",

As expected, the anti-DPP4 antibody successfully ablated replication of wild-type MERS-CoV in both the presence and the absence of trypsin treatment, as measured by both RFP and N protein expression (Fig. 4A and B). In contrast, the human DPP4-blocking antibody had no impact on infection with the MERS-Uganda chimera virus in the presence of trypsin, confirming that the MERS-CoV receptor is not required to mediate infection with the PDF-2180 spike.

Several monoclonal antibodies have been identified as possible therapeutic options for the treatment of MERS-CoV, including LCA60 and G4. We first evaluated LCA60, a potent antibody that binds adjacent to the spike RBD of MERS-CoV (25). However, the major changes in the RBD region of the MERS-Uganda spike predicted a lack of efficacy (Fig. 5A). LCA60 potently neutralized wild-type MERS-CoV grown in both the presence and the absence of trypsin (Fig. 5B). However, consistent with expectations, the LCA60 antibody had no impact on infection with the MERS-Uganda chimera, failing to neutralize the bat spike-expressing virus (Fig. 5B). We subsequently examined a second monoclonal antibody, G4, which had previously mapped to a conserved portion of the S2 region of the MERS-spike (Fig. 5A) (26). With the epitope relatively conserved in the MERS-Uganda spike, we tested the efficacy against the zoonotic spike chimera. However, the results demonstrate no neutralization of MERS-Uganda spike virus by the S2-targeted antibody (Fig. 5C). Notably, G4 also failed to neutralize wild-type MERS-CoV grown in the presence of exogenous trypsin (Fig. 5C). Together, the results indicate that both group 2C CoV spikes could escape neutralization by the S2-targeted antibody in the presence of exogenous trypsin. Overall, these experiments suggest that antibodies targeted against MERS-CoV, even to regions in the highly conserved S2 domain, may not have utility against viruses expressing the PDF-2180 spike.",

            "text": "Based on the MERS-Uganda chimera virus, we wondered if a similar barrier prevented replication of other zoonotic CoVs. Previously, our group had generated a full-length infectious clone for HKU5-CoV, another group 2C coronavirus sequence isolated from bats. Similar to the MERS-Uganda chimera, the infectious clone of HKU5-CoV produced subgenomic transcripts but failed to achieve productive infection (6). Revisiting the full-length recombinant virus, we sought to determine if trypsin treatment could also rescue HKU5-CoV. Following HKU5-CoV infection, the addition of trypsin to the media resulted in cytopathic effect and cell fusion. In contrast, cultures lacking trypsin showed no signs of viral infection. Exploring viral genomic RNA, trypsin in the culture media permitted robust infection with HKU5-CoV that increased over time and was absent in cells not treated with trypsin (Fig. 6A). Similarly, trypsin in the media also permitted the accumulation and proteolytic cleavage of the HKU5 spike protein in a dose- and time-dependent manner (Fig. 6B). Importantly, the addition of the anti-DPP4 antibody had no impact on HKU5-CoV infection, suggesting the use of a different receptor than that used by wild-type MERS-CoV, similar to the findings with the MERS-Uganda spike (Fig. 6C). Together, these results demonstrate that protease cleavage is also the primary barrier to infection of Vero cells with HKU5-CoV. Examining further, we compared the predicted cleavage at S1/S2 border, S2\u2019, and the endosomal cysteine protease site across MERS, PDF2180, and HKU5 spikes (Fig. 6D) (26). For the S1/S2 site, MERS, Uganda, and HKU5 maintain the RXXR cleavage motif, although the different interior amino acids may alter efficiency. For the S2\u2019 sequence, MERS and HKU5 also retain the RXXR motif; however, the Uganda spike lacks the first arginine (SNAR), potentially impacting cleavage. Finally, all three spikes maintain an aromatic residue at position two in the endosomal cysteine protease (ECP) site (27). However, the HKU5 spike maintains N at position 1 which is similar to a MERS mutant previously shown to inactivate cathepsin L activation (28). Together, the results suggest that potential sequence changes in the protease cleavage sites may contribute to the trypsin dependency of MERS-Uganda and HKU5 spike-mediated infections.",

The chimeric virus containing the spike protein from PDF-2180 was capable of replication in Vero cells and human cells (Huh7 and Caco-2) if treated with exogenous trypsin. However, neither continuous nor primary human airway cultures were susceptible to infection, in contrast to wild-type MERS-CoV. The MERS-Uganda chimera also maintained replication despite treatment with antibodies blocking human DPP4, suggesting use of either an alternative receptor or a different entry mechanism for infection. Importantly, current therapeutics targeting the MERS spike protein showed no efficacy against the MERS-Uganda chimera, highlighting a potential public health vulnerability to this and related group 2C CoVs. Finally, the trypsin-mediated rescue of a second zoonotic group 2C CoV, HKU5-CoV, validates findings that suggested that protease cleavage may represent a critical barrier to zoonotic CoV infection in new hosts (29, 30). Together, the results highlight the importance of spike processing in CoV infection, expand the correlates associated with emergence beyond receptor binding alone, and provide a platform strategy to recover previously noncultivatable zoonotic CoVs.",

For CoVs, receptor binding has been believed to be the primary constraint to infection in new host populations. Following the SARS-CoV outbreak, emergence in humans was attributed to mutations within the receptor-binding domain that distinguished the epidemic strain from progenitor viruses harbored in bats and civets (31). Yet, work by our group and others has indicated that zoonotic SARS-like viruses circulating in Southeast Asian bats are capable of infecting human cells by binding to the known human ACE2 receptor without adaptation (13, 14, 32). Similarly, pseudotyped virus studies have identified zoonotic strains HKU4-CoV and NL140422-CoV as capable of binding to human DPP4 without mutations to the spike (30, 33). In this study, we demonstrate that both PDF-2180 and HKU5-CoV spikes are capable of binding to and infecting human cells if primed by trypsin cleavage. Together, the results argue that several circulating zoonotic CoV strains have the capacity to bind to human cells without adaption and that receptor binding may not be the only barrier to CoV emergence.",

            "text": "Data from this study implicate the processing of the spike protein as a critical factor for CoV infection. In the absence of trypsin, the MERS-Uganda and HKU5-CoV spikes were unable to mediate infection and initially suggested a lack of receptor compatibility (6, 16). However, exogenous trypsin treatment produced robust infection, indicating that despite binding to human cells, CoVs cannot overcome incomplete spike processing. As such, evaluating zoonotic virus populations for emergence threats must also consider the capacity for CoV spike activation in addition to receptor binding. While exogenous processing of the spike has been well described as necessary for enteric CoVs (17), spike processing has not been considered a primary barrier for bat CoVs despite their enteric origins. In this new paradigm for bat CoVs, the combination of receptor binding and proteolytic activation by endogenous proteases permits zoonotic CoV infection, as with MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV (Fig. 7). The absence of receptor binding (Fig. 7A) or compatible host protease activity (Fig. 7B) restricts infection with certain zoonotic strains like PDF-2180 or HKU5-CoV. These barriers can be overcome with the addition of exogenous proteases, disrupting the need for host proteases and permitting receptor-dependent or receptor-independent entry (Fig. 7C). Overall, the new paradigm argues that both receptor binding and protease activation barriers must be overcome for successful zoonotic CoV infection of a new host.",

            "text": "The requirement for exogenous trypsin treatment is not unique to MERS-Uganda or HKU5-CoV. Influenza strains are well known to require trypsin treatment to facilitate their release in cell culture (34). In addition, highly pathogenic avian influenza strains have been linked to mutations that improve cleavage by ubiquitous host protease, augmenting their tissue tropism and virulence (35). Similarly, a wealth of enteric viruses, including polio, cowpox, and rotaviruses, depend on trypsin to prime, modulate, and/or expand infection (36, 37). Even within the CoV family, enteric viruses, including porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), porcine delta CoV, and swine acute diarrhea syndrome (SADS) CoV require trypsin for replication in vitro (38\u201340). Together, these prior studies illustrate the importance of protease activation in virus infections. However, the protease barrier to PDF-2180 and HKU5-CoV spike-mediated infection may also reflect on the emergence of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. While initial studies argued that receptor binding was the primary barrier, the existence of zoonotic strains capable of efficiently using the same human entry receptors contradicts that suggestion (13, 14). It is possible that emergence of epidemic CoV strains also requires modifying protease cleavage in either humans or an intermediate host, such as camels or civets, in addition to increased receptor-binding affinity. Consistent with this idea, reports have detailed differential infection with MERS-CoV based on host protease expression (20). Similarly, mouse adaptation of MERS-CoV resulted in spike modifications that alter protease activation and entry in vivo (41). Coupled with the augmented replication and protein production of wild-type MERS-CoV in the presence of trypsin, the results suggest that the proteolytic cleavage epidemic MER-CoV could still be enhanced, potentially by augmenting the cell surface entry mechanism, as previously described for SARS-CoV (42). While group 2B bat CoV strains (WIV1-CoV, WIV16-CoV, and SHC014-CoV) do not require trypsin for infection (9, 13, 14, 43), differences in protease activation may contribute to infection changes relative to the epidemic SARS-CoV. In this context, our findings expand the importance of protease cleavage as a criterion to consider for zoonotic virus emergence in a new host population.",

Neither CoV spike uses human DPP4 for entry, and the PDF-2180 chimera failed to replicate in human respiratory models, even in the presence of trypsin. As many different proteases can promote CoV entry, future studies must determine if other protease treatments or other components can promote virus replication in HAE cultures (29, 44, 45). However, replication in Huh7 and Caco-2 cells indicates human infection compatibility and may portend differential tropism, possibly in the alimentary or biliary tracts, as has been described for several mammalian CoVs (38\u201340). MERS-Uganda or HKU5-CoV could utilize this same trypsin-rich environment in the gut to emerge as an enteric pathogen in humans, although its pathology and virulence would be hard to predict. Evidence from both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV outbreaks suggests the involvement of enteric pathways during infection (46, 47). Replication in the gut might select for mutations that expand spike processing/tropism and allow replication in other tissues, including the lung, and lead to virulent disease in the new host population, as seen with porcine respiratory coronavirus (48). In examining the threat posed by PDF-2180 and HKU5-CoV, we must consider the emergence of these CoVs in tissues other than the lung and that they harbor distinct pathologies compared with epidemic SARS and MERS-CoV.",

            "text": "The receptor dynamics of MERS-Uganda and HKU5-CoV also remain unclear in the context of this study. In the presence of trypsin, neither spike protein requires the MERS-CoV receptor DPP4 for entry, which is consistent with the differences between the receptor-binding domains of the bat and epidemic strains. Therefore, it was not surprising that antibodies that target the RBD of the MERS-CoV spike were ineffective in blocking infection of the PDF-2180 chimera. However, the S2-targeted antibody G4 also had no efficacy against MERS-Uganda, despite a relatively conserved binding epitope. This result is possibly explained by differing amino acid sequences between MERS-CoV and PDF-2180 at the G4 epitope, specifically residue 1175, which is associated with G4 escape mutants in MERS-CoV (49). Alternatively, the G4 antibody also failed to neutralize wild-type MERS-CoV grown in the presence of trypsin, indicating that entry is still possible, despite treatment with antibody binding the S2 domain. These results suggest that trypsin treatment may permit a conformational change either masking the G4 epitope or facilitating fusion/entry prior to antibody binding. Conversely, the presence of trypsin may prime a receptor-independent entry for the MERS-Uganda chimera, similar to the JHVM strain of MHV (50). Yet, this result would contrast with that of PEDV, which requires receptor binding prior to trypsin activation to facilitate infection (39). Importantly, the lack of infection in respiratory cells suggests that some receptor or attachment factor is necessary to mediate entry with the PDF-2180 spike. Recent work with MERS-CoV binding sialic acid supports this idea (51) and indicates that the PDF-2180 spike may not have a similar binding motif. Overall, further experimental studies are required to fully understand the receptor dynamics of the PDF-2180 spike.",

The adaptation of the protease cleavage sites or infection of tissues with robust host protease expression could permit these two zoonotic CoV strains to emerge and may pose a threat to public health due to the absence of effective spike-based therapeutics.
