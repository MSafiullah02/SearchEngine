Gunther et al. reported that the inhalation of heparin or urokinase suppresses the development of bleomycin-induced pneumonitis in rabbits [3], and Izuhara et al. reported that a PAI-1 inhibitor suppresses the development of bleomycin-induced pneumonitis in mice [4]. These findings suggested that anticoagulants can effectively treat IPF, but the efficacy of warfarin was not demonstrated when given to patients in the chronic phase of IPF [5].",

Thrombomodulin has anti-inflammatory as well as high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) inhibitory and anticoagulant activities [10, 11]. Recombinant human soluble thrombomodulin (rhTM) demonstrates anticoagulation effects superior to heparin for the treatment of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) [12] and improves the outcomes and respiratory functions in patients with sepsis-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [13]. Furthermore, Ebina et al. reported reduced expression of thrombomodulin on the surface of vascular endothelial cells in autopsy cases of AE-IPF [14].

In addition, there were some differences between studies in the treatment methodologies utilized. Although all studies, including ours, used steroid pulse therapy and subsequent steroid administration, Kataoka et al. concomitantly administered cyclosporine to all 20 patients, and Isshiki et al. administered cyclosporine to 15 of the 16 patients in their studies. The effectiveness of cyclosporine for AE-IPF has already been demonstrated [19, 20], and we also concomitantly used it to treat 6 of the 13 patients in our untreated group. However, we prohibited the concomitant use of cyclosporine for the following reasons: cyclosporine administration has not been accepted as a standard therapy for AE-IPF yet. There are concerns regarding its considerable cost and adverse reactions, and our goal was to assess the efficacy of rhTM alone. The concomitant use of sivelestat sodium and PMX was also prohibited in the rhTM group, although these drugs were used to treat some patients in the untreated group (Table 3).",

In addition, survival time was calculated using data obtained from patients without endotracheal intubation to avoid the potential influence of the life-extending effects of endotracheal intubation on study results.

In addition, Ebina et al. reported a decrease in thrombomodulin expression in autopsied tissue from patients with AE-IPF [14]. Furthermore, Ware et al. reported that thrombomodulin concentration in pulmonary edema fluid was higher than that in the serum of patients with ALI/ARDS [23]. On the other hand, Kataoka et al. reported that the concentration of thrombomodulin in BAL fluid was 10-fold lower than that in serum in patients with AE-IPF. The same study also showed that the D-dimer concentration in BAL fluid was nearly equal to that in serum [18]. Therefore, it is assumed that the thrombomodulin concentration is relatively lower than the D-dimer concentration in the alveolar space.

Ebina et al. reported that the HMGB1 concentration in BAL fluid increases in a time-dependent manner in patients with AE-IPF [14]. Tsushima et al. also reported that the serum HMGB1 concentration increases in a poor outcome group but is unchanged in a good outcome group [16]. However, marked changes in HMGB1 concentration were not observed in any patient in our study (Fig. 2). It is necessary to clarify the time course change in HMGB1 concentration in BAL fluid to verify whether rhTM induces improvements in disease outcomes through its regulation of HMGB1.",

            "text": "There are some limitations to this study. First, the study was a single center, single arm, non-randomized clinical study, though we used the historical untreated comparison group. Second, the sample size was small, although significant improvement was demonstrated even with this small cohort, suggesting the excellent efficacy of rhTM. There were, however, large variations in patients' background factors before acute exacerbation, the data obtained during acute exacerbation, and the changes in P/F ratio after rhTM administration; clinical courses substantially differed among patients. A larger scale study is required to assess the efficacy of rhTM for treating various types of patients. Third, we did not examine BAL fluid to diagnose AE-IPF. The main purpose of BAL fluid examination was to eliminate the possibility of an active infection. Instead of examining BAL fluid, we determined the presence or absence of an infectious disease by clinical examination, culture tests, antigen testing, antibody testing, and procalcitonin level measurement. An antibacterial agent was administered prior to rhTM treatment when infectious disease was suspected, and rhTM treatment was started only when the absence of an infection was confirmed. Antibacterial agents were given to 3 patients whose symptoms did not improve after starting rhTM plus steroid treatment, but their symptoms also did not improve with antibacterial administration, and they subsequently died. Antibacterial agents were not administered to the remaining 7 patients until they were discharged. The possibility of an opportunistic infection was low in the 10 rhTM subjects included in the analysis because they did not receive any steroid or immunosuppressant treatment and did not have poorly controlled diabetes. Therefore, the possible involvement of a known infectious disease was considered to be low in the disease conditions of the patients with AE-IPF who received rhTM treatment. However, as mentioned above, BAL fluid examination is thought to be useful to assess coagulation and fibrinolytic functions as well as to eliminate the possibility of infection. Thus, examination of BAL fluid as well as measurement of coagulation and fibrinolytic markers in BAL fluid should be performed when patient's conditions permit.",
