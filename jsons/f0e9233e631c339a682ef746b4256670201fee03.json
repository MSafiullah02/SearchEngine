Children with respiratory infections are generally treated as outpatients and the etiology of their disease is usually not investigated. In case of hospitalization, the diagnostic techniques employed are often not sensitive enough (Jin et al. 2007) . It is estimated that 50-85 % of pediatric acute respiratory tract infections are of viral origin. Experience and understanding of the role of viral coinfections in respiratory tract infections have grown in recent years due to the introduction of molecular techniques (Brunstein et al. 2008; Mahony et al. 2007 ). At present, clinical data available on confection are variable, sometimes contradictory, in terms of both the number of viruses involved and the severity of the condition. These discrepancies may be due to such factors as geographical region and detection methods (Kumar 2009 ). The detection of respiratory viruses in children using molecular methods can be challenging. The reason for this is that virus-virus coinfections and mixed viral-bacterial infections occur in 15-30 % of cases and viruses can be detected in 25-45 % of children in the absence of respiratory symptoms (Frobert et al. 2011; Peng et al. 2009; Raymond et al. 2009 ). Although, the effects of viral coinfections have been described and analyzed in the literature, the number of such studies is limited, especially in Central Eastern Europe, including Poland. The aim of this study was to analyze the incidence and clinical course of respiratory tract infections caused by more than one viral etiological factor among children aged 0-59 months.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 320, "end": 337, "text": "(Jin et al. 2007)", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 608, "end": 631, "text": "(Brunstein et al. 2008;", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 632, "end": 650, "text": "Mahony et al. 2007", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 918, "end": 929, "text": "(Kumar 2009", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1232, "end": 1253, "text": "(Frobert et al. 2011;", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1254, "end": 1271, "text": "Peng et al. 2009;", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1272, "end": 1291, "text": "Raymond et al. 2009", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Ethical approval was obtained from the Medical University of Warsaw, Poland.

A total of 114 patients were enrolled into the study: 52 children hospitalized in the General Pediatric Ward and 62 children requiring ambulatory care; all with acute respiratory tract infections.

The incidence of viral coinfections was similar among hospitalized and non-hospitalized children with symptoms of respiratory tract infection (7.6 % vs. 8 %, respectively).

In the literature, coinfection rates appreciably vary depending on the study. Peng et al. (2009) found multiple etiological agents in 36 % of hospitalized children; coinfections occurred predominantly among children aged 3-6 years and the most common pathogens were influenza A, influenza B, and PIV-1. Renois et al. (2010) detected 17 % of multiple infections among patients with acute respiratory tract infections; they were combinations of influenza A/H1N1v virus with CoV, human bocavirus (HBoV), RSV or human rhinoviruses (HRVs). Bonzel et al. (2008) diagnosed viral coinfections in 16 % of samples, with RSV and hBoV being the most common combination. In that study, viral coinfection was found in 17 % of children with bronchitis and in 23 % of those with bronchiolitis, while in patients with pneumonia 33 % were positive for 2 or more viral pathogens. In the present study, the majority of coinfections were associated with influenza A infection and all of them occurred in children younger than 24 months. We failed to not observe any significant differences in the clinical course of infections caused by either a single or multiple viral factors. Our data are in agreement with other studies that have reported no clinical differences between patients with respiratory infections caused by a single or multiple agents detected in nasopharyngeal aspirates from children (Martin et al. 2012; Nascimiento et al. 2010) . Camargo et al. (2012) found coinfections with influenza A H1N1 in 22 % of patients with no greater morbidity or mortality. Suryadevara et al. (2011) diagnosed 28 % of multipathogen viral infections among febrile children younger than 24 months with acute respiratory infections. The most common viruses detected were RSV and rhinovirus/ enterovirus. There were no differences in the severity of disease when comparing patients infected with one or multiple pathogens. However, there are some studies that show that coinfection may be a risk factor for poor evolution. Aberle et al. (2005) reported that airway obstruction was more severe when RSV contributed to coinfection and the hospital stay was lengthened when rhinovirus was involved. In another study, Greensill et al. 2003 showed that when coinfection consisted of RSV and metapneumovirus, evolution was worse. Further, Richard et al. (2008) , who studied the relationship of coinfection with the need for admission to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU), concluded that the presence of two or more viruses increased the likelihood of admission. However, in another study conducted among patients admitted to the PICU, Ghani et al. (2012) found that bacterial coinfection was only associated with a longer hospital stay, with no increase in mortality. Calvo et al. (2008) reported multiple viral infections in hospitalized infants with respiratory tract disease in about 17 % cases and these coinfections were linked to higher fever, longer hospital stays, and a more frequent use of antibiotics compared with the cases of single RSV infections. It is worth noting that the detection of more than one virus may be due to the presence of viral fragments persisting for up to 5-6 weeks after the onset of symptoms, which may actually be irrelevant for the current clinical course. Further studies are required to confirm or exclude associations between co-detected respiratory viruses and to demonstrate the underlying mechanisms of such associations which may lead to cooperation or competition between viruses. Another important issue that remains unclear is the long-term effect that such coinfections may have on the development of chronic lung disease.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 225, "end": 243, "text": "Peng et al.

Another limitation was the lack of inclusion of bacterial coinfections. Predisposing factors for synchronous coinfection were not detected in our study, although there are some other data pointing to such a possibility. For instance, a high rate of codetection of HBoV with HAdV was reported and a prolonged shedding of the HBoV may potentially contribute to this phenomenon (Jartii et al. 2011 ).
