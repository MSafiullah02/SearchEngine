Stents might be preferred due to high risk of accidently removing/dislodging a pcN and possible long-wait until definitive stone treatment can be carried out. In the short-term, preferably use stents with a string for self-removal in order to reduce outpatient visits. General considerations Acute treatment of a patient with renal colic 1) In principle, the same considerations as mentioned in the EAU-Guidelines on Urolithiasis apply, in particular immediate pain relief in patients with an acute stone episode. However, some evidence exists of a link between NSAIDs (Ibuprofen) and both respiratory and cardiovascular adverse effects in several settings, but so far the causality remains unclear. However, the WHO has recommended to avoid the application of ibuprofen when possible. Metamizol seems to be a good alternative in acute renal colic [1, 2] . 2) Renal decompression in case of analgesic refractory colic pain or threatening urosepsis are emergency procedures and shall be performed as soon as the local situation allows [3] .",

Level of evidence 3 General considerations In \"regular\" trauma situations, damage control principles are followed in order to stabilise the patient and delay definitive procedures until the patient is in a better physiological state. In mass casualties event, such as the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, when health system demands exceed its resources, we can use the same principles to postpone non-urgent procedures until better times. A nephrostomy tube, for example, can drain an obstructed kidney even for a few months until reconstructive surgery is planned. One must be mindful that at present we have no indication of when the SARS CoV2 pandemic will be resolved so such patients should be clearly informed on the mechanisms to urgently contact the health care systems in case of an emergency (direct phone numbers and email addresses).",

During the ongoing pandemic, the need for further work-up must be balanced against the increased risk for a patient to visit the hospital.* Depending of the local situation, discuss decompressive surgery (if needed) or upfront EBRT on top of systemic treatment. During the pandemic, offer telemedicine as often as possible. This should be considered as standard provided the patient has no unexplained complication from treatment. Only patients in absolute need for clinical exam should have it. Indeed, it may well be possible to postpone for some months physical assessment and use telemedicine interview.
