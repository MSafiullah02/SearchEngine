Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections remain a worldwide health problem, and no vaccine is currently available. While a number of small molecule inhibitors of virally encoded enzymes are showing promise in clinical trials and some have now been approved by the US FDA, cures of HCV generally require multiple agents with different mechanisms of action due to the development of viral resistance. Such viral escape results from the high error rate of the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, which allows rapid exploration of sequence space, creating myriad quasispecies that may include mutations conferring resistance to any given drug. Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and their cousins small hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) have two advantages over small molecule drugs that suggest a potential solution to the viral resistance problem: first, they can potentially target conserved but \"undruggable\" sequences anywhere in the viral genome, including noncoding sequences, and second, multiple small siRNAs or shRNAs can be combined to foil the ability of the virus to escape through single-site mutations. Chronic HCV infection, which represents the most common form of this disease, is also attractive as a disease target for RNAi because the course of the infection is slow. Thus, there is plenty of time for the biology of RNA interference to take place, in contrast to some very rapid viral infections in which viral replication may outrun treatments that require some hours to take full effect.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "In this review, we describe the development of a new class of RNA interference (RNAi) effectors, short shRNAs, or sshRNAs, as HCV drugs. sshRNAs have been designed to target the conserved internal ribosome entry site (IRES) element of the HCV genome, one of the most highly conserved regions of the viral genome.

Approximately 250,000 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)infected persons in the United States are coinfected with HCV (http://www.cdc. gov/ncidod/diseases/hepatitis/c/). HCV is recognized as a major cause of end-stage liver disease, such as liver cancer (with 1-5% of HCV cases leading to this outcome) and cirrhosis (10-20% of cases), and is the leading indication for liver transplantation in the Western world (Shepard et al. 2005) . Chronic liver disease ranks as the tenth leading cause of death in the United States, and HCV is estimated to account for 40-60% of these cases.

DAAs include small molecules as well as ribozymes, antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs), decoy RNAs, RNA aptamers, siRNAs, and shRNAs.

Double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) molecules are recognized and processed by one or more RNase III-family enzymes (Hammond et al. 2000; Zamore et al. 2000; Bernstein et al. 2001) . Primary transcripts encoding microRNAs (pri-miRs) are processed in the nucleus by a \"microprocessor\" complex to individual hairpins before export to the cytoplasm. In the cytoplasm, dsRNAs longer than~23 bp, including hairpins, are processed by Dicer into double-stranded siRNAs whose strands are each 21-23 nucleotides (nt) in length. Dicer contains a PAZ domain that binds specifically to the 3 0 end of single-stranded RNA and two RNase III domains that possess the catalytic cleavage activity. The distance between the 3 0 -overhang-binding PAZ domain and the active site of the RNase III domains provides a molecular ruler corresponding to the length of an siRNA duplex (Jinek and Doudna 2009) . The cleavage products of Dicer have characteristic termini, a monophosphate group at the 5 0 end, and a two-nucleotide overhang with a 3 0 -hydroxyl at the 3 0 end (MacRae and Doudna 2007). sRNAs, whether generated by dicing of a precursor RNA or introduced from outside the cell, are loaded into an RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) containing a protein of the Argonaute (Ago) family (Elbashir et al. 2001; Lee et al. 2004; Pham et al. 2004; Tomari et al. 2004a, b; Jinek and Doudna 2009) . Ago proteins contain PAZ, middle (MID), and PIWI domains. The binding of an siRNA to an Ago is aided by the presence of a 5 0 phosphate group and a 3 0 dinucleotide overhang at the termini.

To render the \"guide\" (antisense) strand of an siRNA available to pair with its target, the passenger strand must be removed. The selection of which strand is to be removed and which retained is thought to be largely governed by asymmetry in the thermodynamic profile of the siRNA duplex termini (Schwarz et al. 2003; Khvorova et al. 2003) . After the RISC-loading complex (which contains the dsRNA binding protein TRBP along with Dicer and Ago2) loads an siRNA duplex into Ago2, Ago2 cleaves (or \"slices\") the \"passenger\" (sense) strand at a position opposite 10 nt from the 5 0 -phosphate of the guide strand, facilitating the dissociation and/or degradation by C3PO (Ye et al. 2011 ) of the resulting passenger-strand fragments. The loss of the passenger strand from the complex produces the active RISC. The anchoring of the 5 0 phosphate group into the binding pocket of Ago is essential, and the distance from it determines the position of the cleavage site in the passenger strand (this Ago2-mediated passenger-strand cleavage was also found in the processing of some microRNAs [miRNAs] (Diederichs and Haber 2007) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 101, "end": 121, "text": "Okamura et al. 2004;", "ref_id": "BIBREF72"}, {"start": 122, "end": 142, "text": "Meister et al. 2004;", "ref_id": "BIBREF65"}, {"start": 143, "end": 160, "text": "Rand et al. 2004;", "ref_id": "BIBREF76"}, {"start": 161, "end": 177, "text": "Liu et al. 2004;", "ref_id": "BIBREF55"}, {"start": 178, "end": 195, "text": "Song et al. 2004;", "ref_id": "BIBREF99"}, {"start": 196, "end": 214, "text": "Rivas et al. 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF82"}, {"start": 513, "end": 534, "text": "(Schwarz et al. 2003;", "ref_id": "BIBREF89"}, {"start": 535, "end": 556, "text": "Khvorova et al. 2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 886, "end": 901, "text": "(Ye et al. 2011", "ref_id": "BIBREF113"}, {"start": 1311, "end": 1338, "text": "(Diederichs and Haber 2007)", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "RNA Interference"}, {"text": "When passenger-strand slicing is blocked by chemical modification or by mismatches between the two strands of the siRNA, a slower, alternative pathway dissociates and destroys the passenger strand, possibly via an ATP-dependent helicase (RNA helicase A), yielding the active RISC (Matranga et al. 2005; Leuschner et al. 2006; Miyoshi et al. 2005; Kraynack and Baker 2006; Robb and Rana 2007; Rand et al. 2005) .

The currently favored model for target recognition and cleavage by Ago2 is as follows: The target binds to the seed region of the 5 0 half of the guide sequence and then base pairing proceeds toward its 3 0 end. This results in the 3 0 end of the guide strand dissociating from the PAZ domain, leading to a conformational change that positions the active site of Ago2 at the cleavage site on the target (Filipowicz 2005; Tomari and Zamore 2005) .

However, the overall length of the duplex can be shorter than 19 bp. sshRNAs having 17-or 18-bp stems can be virtually as potent as similar 19-bp versions (Fig. 2) . Further shortening of the stem to 16 nt in each strand (connected by UU, which might form a 15-bp stem with a GUUC loop) resulted in somewhat lower activity, and an sshRNA with 15 nt in each arm of the duplex had very little activity. This indicates that potent silencing activity requires a hairpin with a duplex length of at least 16 bp.

For two of these target sites, L-type sshRNAs showed significantly higher potency than R-type; for the third, there was little difference between the two hairpin types. Unlike R-sshRNAs, where loop sizes of 5 nt or greater were optimal (Vlassov et al. 2007; Li et al. 2007 ), the L-sshRNAs were more potent when the loop size was very small (1 or 2 nt) than when it was larger (5 or 10 nt) (Fig. 3) . The IC 50 of an L-sshRNA of 19 bp and a UU loop was slightly more potent than a corresponding siRNA targeting the same region. The loop sequence appeared not to affect the sshRNA activity since three different loop sequences, including one derived from the microRNA miR-23, gave the same results. However, nucleotides adjacent to the loop may affect the activity as they can affect the actual size of the loop. For example, a CG base pair next to a Overhang comparison. L-sshRNAs with and without a 3 0 overhang as well as an siRNA, si19-3, all targeting the same sequence were chemically synthesized, and their ability to inhibit HCV IRESdependent luciferase expression was compared in 293FT cells. (b) Stem length comparison. L-sshRNAs (UU loop) against the same target sequence but with different stem lengths were compared for their inhibitory activity in 293FT cells.

SG119 has a 19-nt antisense sequence directly linked with a 17-nt sense sequence, probably forming a 16-bp duplex and 4-nt loop (UGCA). (d) Stem length comparison with SG119 derivatives. SG131 and SG132 have UU to connect the 3 0 end of the antisense and 5 0 end of the sense strands. They were compared with SG119 for target knockdown in 293FT cells. si131 has two complementary strands 16 nt in length with UU overhangs at their 3 0 ends. as/s values represent the nucleotide lengths of antisense and sense strands. Adapted from Ge et al. (2010b) UU loop can be paired and result in an actual 2-nt loop (Jucker and Pardi 1995) , whereas if that base pair is AU or UA, strain in a 2-nt loop may keep them unpaired, resulting in a 4-nt loop of AUUU or UUUA. Based on studies involving chemical modification, conditional dicer-knockout cells, and Ago immunoprecipitation, we concluded (Dallas et al. 2012 ) that L-sshRNAs having UU loops [which are naturally quite resistant to RNase cleavage (Ge et al. 2010a )] require passengerarm cleavage to be maximally active, but the loops remain intact in the active RISC, with the guide strand breaking its base pairs with the truncated passenger strand to allow pairing with the target. Passenger-strand \"slicing\" is needed apparently to facilitate opening of the guide-passenger duplex. L-sshRNAs have their guide sequence at the 5 0 side of the loop, so the 5 0 end of the guide sequence is immediately available for phosphorylation and binding to the MID pocket of Ago2. R-sshRNAs, on the other hand, require a larger loop for full activity because the loop must be cleaved by some nuclease to create a terminal phosphate at the 5 0 end of the guide strand (see Fig. 1 ). In this case, passenger-arm slicing is less important because the cleavage of the loop itself facilitates removal of the passenger strand in active RISC. Whereas the presence of short flanking sequences such as a 3 0 -overhang generally enhance the efficiency of gene knockdown for R shRNAs (Siolas et al. 2005; Vlassov et al. 2007) , the presence or absence of a 3 0 overhang has relatively little effect on the silencing ability of L-sshRNAs (Fig. 2a ). This appears to be because the loop is generally not cleaved in L-sshRNAs, and when the stem opens up, the loop is available to bind to the PAZ domain of Ago2 (Dallas et al. 2012) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 307, "end": 327, "text": "(Ge et al. 2010a, b;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 328, "end": 347, "text": "Dallas et al. 2012)", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 586, "end": 607, "text": "(Vlassov et al. 2007;", "ref_id": "BIBREF108"}, {"start": 608, "end": 622, "text": "Li et al. 2007", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}, {"start": 2274, "end": 2291, "text": "Ge et al.

Dimerization of hairpin RNAs has been also documented in retroviral RNAs, tRNAs, and some artificial RNA hairpins (Sun et al. 2007 ). The propensity of hairpin RNAs to dimerize depends on their loop size, sequence, and concentration as well as how they are handled (Bernacchi et al. 2005; Liu et al. 2005) . When shRNAs are heated to 95 C and quickly cooled in an ice bath (snap cooling), dimerization can be eliminated (Ge et al. 2010a) . Interestingly, sshRNAs showed efficient target knockdown both before and after the heating/snap cooling procedure, even for some sshRNAs that were predominantly dimers before the treatment, suggesting that the dimers of certain sshRNAs are functional molecules that can be processed and utilized by the RNAi machinery with similar efficiency as the monomers.

It can be seen from Table 3 that two sshRNAs of the same structure but different sequences can have very different immunostimulatory properties. Blunt sshRNAs are particularly efficient at inducing RIG-I. In each case, however, 2 0 -O-methylation renders them non-stimulatory, by blocking recognition by pattern recognition sensors such as RIG-I.
