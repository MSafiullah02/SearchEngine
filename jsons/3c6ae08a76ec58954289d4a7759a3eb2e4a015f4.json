[25] Since then, due to their adaptability, biosensors have been urbanized for the recognition of some complex biological species like virus, [26] pathogens, [27] insulin, [28] neurotransmitters, [29] and hormones. [30] In recent times, menacing diseases caused by viruses, for instance, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Nipah, avian influenza, Hendra, etc. have affected human life significantly, thus biosensor can be a beneficial tool for their detection due to their on-site, realtime monitoring and early detection capability. [31] [32] [33] A biosensor performance evaluation is primarily executed on the basis of the limit of detection, reproducibility, sensitivity, selectivity, linear dynamic range, and other peculiarities. [24] Also, other parameters like portability, response time, accessibility, storage, and operational stability need to be considered. Numerous materials such as semiconductor, [34] magnetic nanoparticle, [35] metal oxide, [36] carbon-based nanomaterial, [37] and intrinsically conducting polymer [29] (ICP) have been developed for biosensing applications. Among the abovementioned material, ICP is much-admired for biosensors due to its paramount characteristics such as biocompatibility, [38] inimitable electronic structure [39] (for facile transfer of electrons), tunable electrical conductivity [40] (via doping), environmental stability, [41] facile corrosion-free synthesis, [42] and sensitivity to small perturbations. [43] Because of their efficient electron transfer capability, formed upon biochemical reactions, they have been comprehensively utilized as transducers in biosensor that forms an intermediary layer between the biological molecule and electronics that are used for signal readout. A number of investigations on ICPs have been carried out in the field of biosensors where a typical example is in aptamer sensing. Gao et al. exploited an enzymatically catalyzed-polyaniline, where they found the limit of detection of 1 fM for DNA sensing. [44] Another researcher, Komaravo et al., synthesized polypyrrolebased biosensor for the recognition of Variola major virus and achieved 16 pM detection limit.

[51] In this context, extensive literature analysis reveals that no consolidated literature is as such available on doped-ICP and ICP-composite materials for biosensing application to the best of our perception. Thus, we have discussed in detail on the significance of ICPs and their composites based on gold nanoparticles, carbon nanotubes, graphene and their derivatives, and hybrid composites along with doped-ICP for biosensing of copious biomolecules. Simultaneously, we have described the sensing mechanisms of different biosensors based on enzymes, DNAs, and antibodies and their interaction with their organic counterpart that leads to signal generation.

[52] [53] [54] [55] They can be either insulator or semi-conductor in undoped or neutral form that can be transformed into doped form by redox reaction forming delocalized charge carriers. In general, ICPs possess alternating single (\u03c3) and double (\u03c0) bonds in the main chain and these \u03c0-conjugated systems impart the ICPs their inherent electrochemical, optical, and electrical or electronic properties. The benefit that ICP possesses over several organic polymers is tunable chemical structure, which can be modified to alter the conductivity and solubility of these polymers. For example, adopting poly(3-hexylthiophene) as a functional group can enhance the processibility and solubility of some insoluble polymers. [56] Among the copious ICPs, aromatic-based conductive polymers have attracted great attention of researchers because it offers high conductivity, good chemical and thermal stability. [57] As in saturated polymer, where all the four valence electrons of carbon are covalently bonded, the electronic configuration of conjugated ICP is totally different. The chemical bonding, here, leads to one unpaired \u03c0-electron per atom of carbon. Also, this \u03c0-bonding leads to delocalization of electron by lateral overlapping of p-orbitals alongside the backbone of the ICP, providing the \"highway\" for charge mobility. This unique electronic structure of ICP contributes to low ionization potential, high electron affinity, and low energy optical transition which in turn leads to their electrical conductivity. [58] However, conjugation alone is not sufficient enough to contribute to conductivity of such polymers. Thus, doping is a process where the conductivity is augmented up to several orders of magnitude by introducing different doping agents that are either partial oxidizing (p-doping) or partial reducing agents (n-doping). [59] With the help of such process, charged defects such as soliton, polaron (radical ions), and bipolaron can be introduced into the ICP which are then available as charge carriers.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 252, "end": 256, "text": "[52]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 257, "end": 261, "text": "[53]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 262, "end": 266, "text": "[54]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 267, "end": 271, "text": "[55]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 972, "end": 976, "text": "[56]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1156, "end": 1160, "text": "[57]", "ref_id": "BIBREF56"}, {"start": 1773, "end": 1777, "text": "[58]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2097, "end": 2101, "text": "[59]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conducting Polymers"}, {"text": "To date, biosensors modified with the aid of a solitary material were not commercialized owing to their surface poisoning because of adsorbed intermediates, low sensitivity, poor selectivity, and intervention from additional species. Also, though ICPs provide copious benefits, the progress in increasing the properties has not been commensurate with those of their carbon-based, metallic, and metal oxide counterparts. [60] Thus, forming composites of ICP with different materials avoid these difficulties and find attractive features in the field of biosensing. [61] ICPs have also been hybridized and modified with other heterogeneous components to overcome their limitations such as long-term stability, [62] solubility, [63] and processing. [24] These components not only provide augmented mechanical and thermal stability, but also distinct functionalities that depend on chemical nature, crystallinity, size, and structure of the reinforcement. [38] Strategic coupling of the ICP with other counterparts can result in many epitome properties providing opportunities in myriad applications ranging from storage device to sensors and biosensors. [64] [65] [66] Successful incorporation of this particle in polymer framework also provides an enhanced rate of electron transfer at the altered surface/electrolyte interface. [67] In the field of nanoscience and nanotechnology, incorporation of nanoparticles into ICP matrix has attracted considerable attention of scientists as well as researchers. [68] The arena of ICP-based nanocomposite has expanded enormously because of their potential characteristics such as superior electrocatalytic activity, augmented electrical conductivity, and decent chemical stability in aqueous solution. [69] Interest in integrating metal nanoparticle was motivated by their application in biosensors due to their nano-range size, unique physical, electronic, and chemical properties (different from their bulk material), flexibility to build amended and novel sensing device. [70] Incorporation of carbon-based material (such as graphene [GN] and carbon nanotube [CNT]) leads to interaction of CNT and GN with ICP, which is an important attribute that regulates the efficiency and working of a carbon-based ICP biosensor. [71] Conjugation along with the highly hydrophobic surface of CNT and GN allows them to interact with the ICPs via hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions. Hence, a synthetic customized approach for developing a novel type of biosensor using this combination will give an entirely different carbon-based ICP composite with a new set of fascinating properties. [72] [73] [74] Selectivity of a biosensor largely depends upon the recognition element (e.g., antibody) and also on the type of host matrix and the interaction between them. Thus, integration of nanoparticle is convenient for attaining adequate stability and sensitivity since nanoparticle acts as a redox mediator of biological molecule and ICP acts as a selective adsorbate for these molecules.

The reaction amid analyte and the biomolecule causes chemical alterations such as change in mass or pH, release of heat, formation of different chemical or flowing of electrons that can be transformed into an electrical output by transducer. The aim of a biosensor is generation of a digital signal that is relative to the concentration of the peculiar analyte. The type of signal that is being transduced by ICP depends on the type of ICP, doped state of ICP, and the binding molecule used. For example, small molecule can diffuse into the polymeric chains that can give rise to chemical reaction with ICP, thereby varying its state of doping.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 283, "end": 287, "text": "[78]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Biosensors"}, {"text": "In the initial stage, the bio-recognition molecule is immobilized on the transducer surface that forms a specific complex with the target analyte.

The transduction of the biochemical signal can be carried out in the form of electrochemical, optical, thermometric, and piezoelectric transducer combined with bioreceptors.

[84] [85] [86] [87] A schematic of the principle of an electrochemical biosensor is depicted in Figure 4 . The underlying principle of this type of biosensor is that the electrochemical reaction produces or consumes electrons causing changes in the electrical characteristics of the analyte that can be determined and used as a parameter for measuring it. [78] This change in electrical properties can be correlated with the amount of the biological molecules or the rate at which it is produced or consumed. [88] The electrochemical reaction being monitored would cause generation of a detectable current (amperometric), a detectable charge/potential accumulation (potentiometric), or alter the conductivity (conductometric) of the analyte medium between the electrodes. A review by Moon et al. reveals the use of electrochemical biosensor based on conductive polymer for recognizing neurotransmitters that control the physiological and behavioral function in the peripheral and central nervous system.

Amperometric biosensor relies on determining the current produced by electrochemical redox reaction of electro-active species, as a function of time, with a fixed applied potential on the electrode surface, most commonly an ICP. The applied potential aids in efficient electron transfer reaction and the resulting current determined is directly proportional to the electro-active product's concentration over a linear applied potential range.

The biological function of a living cell and an enzyme can be modulated based on the electrode potential adjustment by implementing the use of polypyrrole molecular interface. Often additionally obtained discernment of electrochemical interfaces by employing ICPs as matrices for enzymes permits the use of such biosensors for scrutinizing natural samples, for example, flow injection perseverance of lactate in whole blood. [92] Apart from the advantage of decent polymer layer formation, this method yields some bottlenecks, associated with a considerable electrochemical activity of ICPs because of the similarity in these materials toward redox equilibria and ion-exchange process. It was reported in the year 1969 where an enzyme-based potentiometric biosensor was established for sensing urea.

[100] Conductometric Biosensor: On the course of biochemical reaction, charges are produced that causes changes in the overall conductance or resistance of the analyte. Thus, conductometric biosensor provides analytical information by measuring the conductivity of analyte between two electrodes that varies with the concentration of ionic species. Conductometric biosensors, in most cases, are strongly associated with enzymes where the conductivity (as a result of ionic strength) of the analyte alters [93] www.advancedsciencenews.com www.mcp-journal.de owing to the enzymatic reaction between two electrodes hence, they can be utilized to examine the enzymatic reaction that yield deviations in the concentration of charged species. [93] But the applicability of this enzyme-based conductometric biosensor is limited because of the mutable ionic background of diverse samples and also the necessity for evaluating minor variation of conductivity in media of different ionic strength. [101, 102] Though conductometric biosensor has not been implemented extensively, they have found their successful application in the field of foodborne pathogen detection where Zarini et al. synthesized a rapid, versatile, specific, and highly sensitive polyaniline based conductometric biosensor where they found a lower detection limit of 7.9 \u00d7 10 1 colony forming units (CFU) per milliliter for Escherichia coli O157: H7 and Salmonella.

[104] This was considered as the inaugurating idea for the construction of new generation piezoelectric mass-sensitive appliance. Also, in the past few decades, immobilization of biomolecule onto the functionalized surface turned out to be the paramount application of this biosensor. They also allow for label-free recognition of biomolecules however, they are considered a lot more than a mere mass biosensor because the response of biosensor is also swayed on the surface charge, viscoelastic attributes of biomolecule, surface roughness, and interfacial phenomena. These new insights have opened up the use of this biosensor in the adhesion of liposomes, proteins, and cells onto the surface thus allowing for determination in morphological changes in cells. [105] Measurement in the piezoelectric biosensor is based on measuring variation in resonance frequency of an ICP-coated piezoelectric crystal that relies on the minute mass changes on the crystal surface. The basic principle of this biosensor is the transmission of an electrical signal through an ICP-coated piezoelectric crystal that causes vibration (as shown in Figure 5 ) at a certain resonant frequency which relies on its mass, size, shape, and chemical structure. [2] The mass change, as a result of biomolecule adsorption on the electrode surface, is used for measuring the specific biological activity. These are brought about by the interaction between the analyte and immobilized biomolecule on the crystal surface. The vibration frequency of the oscillating crystal usually decreases when the analyte binds to bioreceptor on the surface. Such biosensors normally operate by propagation of acoustoelectric waves, either through the bulk or along the crystal surface. [106] Based on this, piezoelectric biosensors are of two types: surface acoustic wave and bulk wave. However, they have not received much attention and are compared inferior to the electrochemical biosensor. [88] Such type of biosensor has been employed for the detection of hydrogen sulfide, carbon monoxide, ammonia, and also caffeine. [107] A modern approach for the preparation of molecularly imprinted polypyrrole in combination with piezoelectric quartz crystal based caffeine sensor was prepared with a detection limit of 0.024 \u00b5m.

Some major benefits of this type of biosensor are stability, possibility of miniaturization, and increased sensitivity. [112] Additionally, they can be miniaturized effortlessly and incorporated with the microfluidics for augmenting the sensitivity. Most of the biochemical reactions are exothermic and have an enthalpy of \u224880 kJ mole \u22121 . [113] In real sample determination of glucose, interference is often encountered from an electro-active substance in the blood. However, calorimetric biosensors are insensitive to electroactive and optical interference that is present in clinical samples.

Different optical properties such as absorption, fluorescence, bioluminescence, chemiluminescence, internal reflection, surface plasmon resonance can be exploited for monitoring the bio-recognition event in biosensors. [115] For example, a chemiluminescence-based device measures the changes in the frequency of emission of light upon biochemical reaction which is caused by the origination of excited states that lasts for a very short duration. [91] The biochemical reaction continuously alters the optical properties of the analyte causing light emission which is continuously monitored with the aid of optical fiber or by optical waveguide device. [106, 116] In this type of biosensor, there is resilience in the measurement modes, for example, surface reflectance, evanescent wave, and embryonic technologies as surface plasmon resonance (SPR). Also, there is a drive toward the incorporation of some optical components (waveguides, detectors, source, and sampling region) onto the planar platform. [117, 118] Figure 7 demonstrates the working of an optical/photometric biosensor. Recently, a novel doped polyaniline-dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate film coated on fiber bragg grating was utilized as an optical fiber-based sensor for the detection of chloroform. This biosensor exhibited good recyclability of up to ten cycles with a swift response period of 7 s and a detection limit of 9.22 ppm. [119] Another researcher, Angelica et al., utilized a copolymer of aniline and ortho-phenylenediamine for the determination of the degree of freshness of tilapia (Orechromis niloticus) using colorimetric method. The optical sensor was sensitive to alkaline vapors such as volatile amines that generate during spoilage of fish and the sensor displayed changes in color as a function of pH. [120] SPR is the most widely used optical biosensor which uses surface plasmon waves (SPW) for detecting changes upon interaction of target analyte and bio-recognition element. [121] Upon exposure of SPR to any alterations, it induces a change in refractive index upon biochemical reaction that is used to measure and observe the reaction. This change brings about variation in propagation constant of SPW that can be measured to produce a reading. The important feature of SPR is the labelfree recognition without the aid of fluorescence and radioactivity making it extremely appealing for real-time monitoring. To date, SPR is being widely used in drug discovery, health science research, fundamental biological studies, clinical and environmental diagnosis.

[126] An antibody, which is precise to a particular antigen, fits in a highly specific way to that antigen. This peculiar characteristic of antibodies is vital for their utilization in the immunosensors where specific antigen fits into the antibody binding site.

Thus, biosensor utilizing antibodies as a bio-receptor are being used extensively as it provides high specificity, versatility, and strong affinity (but of covalent nature) toward the target antigens.

Hence, immobilization of the biomolecule on to the solid interface is the central step for the advancement of a competent biosensor with appropriate performances such as acquiring high reproducibility, high sensitivity, high reliability, short response time, and good operational stability. [129] Actually, the utilization of an immobilized biomolecule is preferred because it offers robustness, prolonged availability, ease of handling, and resistance to environmental variations. [130] The activity of a biosensor relies on the materials characteristics (surface area, biocompatibility, electron transfer efficiency, porosity) and methods used for immobilization but eventually, the immobilized biomolecules must retain their structure, sensitivity, and biological activity and simultaneously, it should not decay or desorb over the use of biosensor. [131, 132] However, some methods of immobilization may decrease the sensitivity of biosensor caused due to various issues such as conformational change and denaturation of biomolecule, lower efficacy in the presence of insoluble substrates, and mass transfer limitations. [133] A better sensitivity can be obtained by appropriate orientation of enzymes (as shown in Figure 11 ) on the surface of the transducer that exposes the active site in the solution phase. [134] Copious materials such as magnetic hydrogels, sol-gels, resins, clays have been utilized for the immobilization of biomolecule but most of the mentioned materials have various limitations such as poor biocompatibility, difficult synthesis, poor controllability, and poor response properties. [132, [135] [136] [137] [138] Thus, there is a substantial need for the development of biosensor electrodes that has improved compatibility with biomolecules and quick response time. ICPs provide an organized molecular structure on electrode surface that permits their utilization for immobilizing the active biomolecules because they function as a 3D matrix that preserves the activity of biomolecule for a prolonged period. This characteristic of ICP, along with their viability as a membrane, has furnished with new opportunities for exploring a biosensor. [139] Simultaneously, they render an excellent platform for immobilizing biomolecule since they are known to offer durability, porosity, selectivity, excellent electron transfer rate, biocompatibility, and better signal transduction. [140, 141] Integrating enzymes into the organic ICP matrix prevents the biomolecule from leaching out of the matrix while retaining the accessibility of catalytic active sites as a result of the permeability of films to analyte. [142] In vivo biomedical application requires biocompatibility of the material that is being utilized for a specific purpose. [143] Thus, immobilized biomolecule alongside with organic nature of ICP renders them biocompatible in neutral aqueous solution, which makes the possibility of in vivo application for continuous metabolites and drug monitoring in biological fluids. [144, 145] Despite the copious benefits provided by ICP, they have stability and property issues that are affected by ambient conditions such as oxygen, redox reactant, acidic and basic media. [146] Moreover, the physical and electronic characteristics of ICP are also a matter of concern for certain application. For example, in a bioelectrochemical application, it is essential to retain the conductivity of ICP at a pH value of above 4. [147, 148] Also, it is obligatory to ponder the consequence of integration of counter ion as a dopant on pH stability of ICP during synthesis. [149] Recently, researchers have demonstrated the benefit of various nanomaterial for the immobilization of biomolecule that aids in enhancing the stability and performance of immobilized biomolecule. [150] [151] [152] Similar to ICP, which have ascertained to show good sensing characteristics, nanomaterial has also offered attractive feature providing with good electronic and surface area characteristics for further advancement of the biosensor. The physicochemical property of nanomaterial renders an ideal remedy to some conflicting disputes employed for the optimization of enzymes such as maximum surface area for effective enzyme loading, minimum diffusion limitation, along with the polymeric characteristics such as porosity, stability, and www.advancedsciencenews.com www.mcp-journal.de good conductivity. [51] Thus, integration of nanomaterial into ICP matrix can generate a powerful ICP-composite that offers numerous benefits such as tunable physical and chemical properties along with structural and functional flexibility which aids in immobilization of biomolecule. [132] For the sake of higher stability and sensitivity of biosensor, intense research efforts have been executed for the advancement of successful approaches for immobilization.

[158] This coupling agents generally cross-links with phenolic groups of tyrosine, amino groups lysine, sulfhydryl groups of cysteine, or imidazole groups of histidine for enzyme binding. [133, 157] Though this method offers short response time and strong chemical binding among biomolecules, there are many bottlenecks associated with this technique: i) it results in multilayer formation of biomolecules, resulting in decrease in activity; ii) it causes loss of biomolecules due to uncontrollable reaction; iii) it may also cause deterioration in activity as a result of distortion of active biomolecule conformation and chemical variation of active site during cross-linking; iv) poor stability because of the biomolecule exposed directly to the solution; v) the layer of biomolecule is not rigid; vi) large diffusional barriers causing delay in interactions.

They achieved an overwhelmingly robust linkage among the polymer matrix and biomolecule with the aid of glutaraldehyde. Also, they optimized the amount of cross-linker of up to 2.5% that is required for achieving ideal cross-linking. [161] Apart from the conventional procedures of immobilization, the coupling of biomolecule in electropolymerized films has sought significant importance due to its nonmanual procedure and reproducibility. Electrochemical entrapment is a one-step method where an appropriate potential is applied to the transducer submerged in an aqueous solution of electropolymerizable monomer and buffer containing biomolecule forming polymer layers integrated with homogenously distributed biomolecules/bio probes. [162] Near the vicinity of transducer surface, the biomolecules are incorporated into the www.advancedsciencenews.com www.mcp-journal.de growing polymer network by physical means. This simple onestep immobilization technique does not affect the biomolecule activity since there is no chemical reaction involved between the biomolecule and in situ polymerized ICP. This process offers numerous benefits like reproducibility and potentiality of amalgamation of co-enzymes or some another enzyme concurrently by directly embodying them into the solution. [163] This well-controlled technique for biomolecule immobilization is greatly significant in the construction of multi-enzyme and micro-sensor. Over conventional procedures, electrochemical entrapment offers numerous advantages such as one-step facile fabrication, accurate control over film thickness, and greater reproducibility, however drawbacks that this procedure provides are possibility of blemishing the biomolecule because of the potential applied while polymerization, poor target approachability due to biomolecule incorporation amid bulk ICP film and the process is suitable only for water-soluble monomer. [164, 165] The most commonly used ICP is polypyrrole. Recently, Ganjali et al. constructed a novel and selective biosensor based on electropolymerized polypyrrole for the entrapment of cytochrome C aptamer on a screen printed electrode. It also exhibited a linear response over a concentration range of 10 pm to 1 nm and limit of detection 5 pm.

They proposed the as-synthesized composite for their use in biosensing because the individual counter-parts revealed matching optical characteristics that permitted charge transfer to occur, upon light absorption, between them exhibiting a significant enhancement in photonic reactivity. The composite showed enhanced photonic reactivity toward the environmental stimuli such as redox, pH, or change in refractive index. [175] Apart from this, the fact that this composite remained stable in aqueous solution allowed for their development in the field of biological science. One of the fascinating applications of Au-ICP based nanocomposite in DNA sensing is for the detection of the gender of arowana fish (or dragon fish) on-site which is necessary for optimal production of this cultured fish. So, Marugan et al. prepared a kappa-carrageenan-AuNP-polypyrrole based DNA biosensor where they covalently anchored the ssDNA probe of the dragon fish on the composite surface. [176] Since polypyrrole has fragile properties, [177] kappa-carrageenan was used for developing a mechanically strong ICP composite for biosensing. Genomic DNA samples collected from the scales of fish were subjected to DNA extraction and the resulting biosensor revealed wide response range, good stability, and low detection limit of 5 \u00d7 (up to two orders of magnitude) in comparison with the traditional thiol self-assembled monolayers. [178] De et al. fabricated a platform for biosensing of three different biomolecules viz., glucose, DNA, and protein by immobilizing glucose oxidase, single-stranded DNA, and Lamin A antibody, respectively by using polyaniline nanowire decorated with gold nanoparticles. Method of detection and immobilization for each system was different and the biosensor displayed excellent specificity, higher sensitivity, greater stability, and low detection limit which proved the Au-polyaniline composite suitable as general biosensor platform.

They found the detection limit to be 0.68 ng mL \u22121 . [180] The practicality of the biosensor was also shown by successfully applying the modified biosensor to blood serum samples for detecting PSA. Omidfar et al. fabricated an ultrasensitive sensing platform for detecting E. coli utilizing surface modified screen-printed carbon electrode by first polyaniline film and then AuNP. In the next step, avidin, followed by biotinylated DNA probe was immobilized covalently on the modified electrode by avidinbiotin interaction. [181] The described electrochemical assay was found to detect 4*10 6 to 4 CFU of E. coli and concluded that this geneosensor had potential for accurate and rapid diagnosis of E. coli imposed infections. Au-ICP composites have also been widely used in medical diagnosis for the recognition of destructive cancer cells. Shim et al. designed a novel, facile, and biocompatible aptamer-based nano-biosensor for the detection of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells. The authors covalently immobilized MUC1 aptamer probe on the ICP composite synthesized by self-assembly of 4-([2,2\u2032:5\u2032,2\u2033-terthiophen]-3\u2032-yl) benzoic acid layer on AuNPs and obtained a detection limit as low as 8 cell mL \u22121 .

One of the important attributes is the helicity of honeycomb of carbon in respect to tube axes. [194] Also, it is well prominent that the characteristics of CNTs are sensitive to be influenced by their exposure to biomolecules that has led to their exploration as a sensing element for biological sensor. [195] [196] [197] Considering their exceptional surfaceto-volume ratio, wide electrochemical window, efficient electron transfer, and large specific surface area, they have been renowned as an ideal material for the fabrication of biosensor since it is conceivable to attain ultra-fast detection of biomolecule at very low concentrations. [198, 199] Hence, CNT-based biosensors are one of the best contenders for ultra-sensitive sensing methodology. Though CNTs provide with copious benefits, some limitations such as poor processibility hinder their application because of the randomly lying CNTs on the electrode surface that assist in easy peel-off thus depressing the reproducibility of biosensor. [200] Thus many methodologies such as multi-functionalization and composite formation with ICPs have been implemented to make CNTs processable and minimize the agglomeration. It has also been reported that wrapping CNTs with conjugated polymers render them processable. Briefly, CNTs exhibit \u03c0-conjugated structure along with a highly hydrophobic surface that allows their interaction with the aromatic ICPs via \u03c0-\u03c0 and hydrophobic interactions that form new structures known as composites that can be utilized for biosensing.

Thus, the enhanced performances of the biosensor are attributed to the presence of horseradish peroxidase along with glucose oxidase that enhances overall biochemical reaction.

[220, 221] GR structure caters with multitudinous attributes including excellent electrical and thermal conductivity, high mechanical strength, large specific surface area, tunable band gap, high electron mobility, and room-temperature hall effect. [221] [222] [223] Principally, the structure of GR and performance benefits such as high charge mobility and surface-to-volume ratio can be elucidated into immensely sensitive sensing application. [224] The conjugated \u03c0-electrons in GR sheets are delocalized that provides ballistic charge transport throughout the sheet with trifling optical absorption and based on these exceptional attributes, they have sought application in composites, aerospace, solar cells, supercapacitors, sensors, and biosensors. [225] [226] [227] Unlike the tubular structure of CNTs, GR is a 2D sheet with open structure thus both the sides of GR sheets can be employed for supporting biomolecules. [228] However, it has been found that the 2D graphene layers, owing to their intrinsic van der Walls interactions, results in restacking to form graphite or cause irreversible agglomeration. Thus, this drawback can be overcome by the addition of other macromolecule or by the use of polymers. [229] [230] [231] [232] Unique attributes of ICP and GR in coalition have attracted the interest of researchers in recent times as a result of the creation of new composite material for its application in next-generation biosensor devices. This GR-based ICP composite provides with biomolecule loading platform and amplify or harness the adsorption, redox reaction, catalytic reaction, and transport behavior of the system. ICPs act as conducting conduits that interact with GR and analytes and enhance sensitivity, selectivity, response time, lower detection limit, and ultimately give rise to extraordinary biosensors as the grafted ICP with GR alters the in-plane characteristics of composite materials. [233] [234] [235] As GR-sheets incorporated ICP matrix have poor adhesion between them, numerous approaches have been developed to boost the adhesion characteristics of GR by modifying their structure. Also, there exists chemical inertness of GR that makes it challenging to attain multi-functional and altered hybrid nanomaterials. Thus chemically modified GR such as graphene oxide (GO) and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) have been developed for multi-functionalization. For instance, covalent immobilization of the biomolecule, defective plane, and rich edge reaction sites contribute to the recognition of target analyte.

The aim was to curtail the analysis time from 19 days to 15 min and annual cost by more than USD 20 million in the United States. The investigator emphasized on the major bottleneck in the development of biosensor that is discrepancy of the market for environmental measurements hence no one analyte is enough to justify the advancement cost of a specific biosensor. Thus Schmidt proposed that the required biosensor that is capable of determining dozens of analytes can be developed in 6-7 months with \u2248USD 70 000. [279] In another instance, Rescue Service Agency (Sweden) sought an \"artificial dog nose\" for localizing minefields and free other zones of land. The biosensor application was intended to deliver a prototype that would cost roughly USD 100 000 in August1999. The field testing was planned in Sweden's military field and they also considered its actual utilization in Angola. [280] The University of Mississippi proposed the detection of steroidogenic activity (endocrine disrupting compounds) in environmental chemicals in Basin of Mississippi River with an estimated time period of 1-2 years with USD 250 000-300 000 for the construction of biosensor. [281, 282] Rogers et al. indicated the development of new methods and instruments for a promising in situ monitoring of toxic chemicals. They compared two distinct detection systems (biosensor and immunoassay kit) for the surveillance of a groundwater pump-and-treat system. The projections were acquired from initial investment cost versus cost for each sample wherein the estimated cost for biosensor was USD 8 and that of immunoassay kit from USD 50 to 75 per assay. The cost of the biosensor was slightly offset from start-up cost for the kits, which was substantially cheaper. [283] One of the major markets of the biosensor is glucose monitoring in human urine and blood samples. This market is unique and large enough to stimulate stand-alone business with sales in excess of USD 100 million per year (1996) . [284] The cost of this product ranges from cents (for paper strips) to almost USD 1 (for disposable electrodes) utilized in commercially available electrochemical biosensors.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 657, "end": 662, "text": "[279]", "ref_id": "BIBREF279"}, {"start": 1032, "end": 1037, "text": "[280]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1310, "end": 1315, "text": "[281,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1316, "end": 1320, "text": "282]", "ref_id": "BIBREF282"}, {"start": 1892, "end": 1897, "text": "[283]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2118, "end": 2124, "text": "(1996)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2127, "end": 2132, "text": "[284]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Life Cycle Assessment of a Biosensor Device"}, {"text": "As the last example, the advancement of a biosensor that mimics, closely, the biological sensory function is discussed. [285] Initially, no costs were presented but to convert the concept of ion-channel switch biosensor to practical device, [286] it took around 10 years and 60 scientists and engineers. The change in ion flux through the membrane is detected as a change in conductance of membrane. The benefit this sensor provides is direct functional test of the interaction between an artificial cell membrane and the potential drug. Recently, researchers from Stanford University have developed a wearable biosensor that determines the level of Cortisol (a hormone linked to stress) from the sweat of human being that can help to maintain physical fitness and optimum health status.

Since the discovery of glucose biosensor by Clark, research in this field has augmented and never looked back. Of the various materials developed for the construction of biosensor, intrinsically conductive polymers have acquired a considerable interest of scientists and industrialists, thanks to their paramount characteristics such as inimitable electronic structure, biocompatibility, and tunable electrical conductivity. Though they provide with copious attributes, ICPs have stability and property issues in different ambient conditions such as oxygen media, acidic or basic media. Thus, materials such as AuNP, GR and their derivatives, CNTs, and hybrid materials, due to their exceptional attributes, have been amalgamated with ICP to improve the performance characteristics such as rapid response, good selectivity, increased sensitivity, long-term stability, and lower detection limit. Thus, we have meticulously consolidated the existing literature on various composites of ICPs with different materials along with doped conductive poly mer based biosensor. Simultaneously, diverse forms of biosensors and the importance of the ICP and their composites for immobilizing the biomolecule have also been highlighted. ICPs along with nanomaterials provide a 3D matrix that preserves the activity of biomolecule and renders excellent platform for immobilization since they offer excellent durability, porosity, selectivity, excellent electron transfer rate, biocompatibility, and better signal transduction. As described previously, various ICPbased composites have been reconnoitered to fabricate unique biosensors that utilize ICP composite as transducer elements, however, the opportunity for extra development is still provided. The clever amalgamation of diverse nanostructured materials with best ICPs will pave the way for utilizing novel ICP composites for manufacturing enhanced sensing platform with superior performance. The major interferences that the biosensor market came across were the inadequacy of availability of mass market thus, from the viewpoint of profit, it causes severe resistance for investors to invest in biosensor technology. Complex fabrication route and mercantile advancement of biosensor technology required for manufacturing many devices can be considered as the limitation for mass production.
