Citizens blocked traffic at three major business/administrative districts by building encampments that were occupied for nearly three months. An estimated 17% of the 7.2 million Hong Kong citizens joined the protests (The Chinese University of Hong Kong, 2014). The Umbrella Movement was probably the first large-scale pro-democracy movement among Chinese since the Tiananmen Square protests in 1989. The impact on mental and physical health and specific predictors of these outcomes following political movements are unknown for Chinese populations, or indeed following similar movements elsewhere in the world (e.g., the Arab Spring).",

            "text": "The conservation of resources (COR) theory suggests that resource loss is the central mechanism driving adaptation to stress. Resources broadly include those personal, social, and material resources that we centrally value and are often divided between internal and external resources (Hobfoll, 1998;\nHou and Wan, 2012). Internal or personal resources consist of entities that are possessed by the self and can be mobilized on one\u2019s own such as sense of self-worth, sense of control over one\u2019s life, and optimism (Diener et al., 2003). External resources consist of entities that are embedded within the physical environment or interpersonal interactions, such as social relationships, money, and employment (House et al., 1988). A summary of media reports revealed that people supported the Movement because they foresaw threat of resource loss including abolishment of the rule of law and deprivation of freedom (e.g., speech and press) (Bertolini, 2015, Cheung, 2014). Use of tear gas and pepper spray, physical assaults to suppress the protestors, and cases of selective law enforcement (e.g., non-action to some violence against the protestors by anti-protestors) further heightened people's perceived threat of potential political oppression if there was no universal suffrage in 2017. The Umbrella Movement could be understood as an investment of internal or external resources to create passageways for political resources, i.e., democracy and universal suffrage, among some Hong Kong citizens (Hobfoll, 2012). A recent study focusing on the Arab Spring in North Africa and the Middle East has shown that the timing of social protest is linked to a particular increase in food prices (Lagi et al., 2011). This suggests that the inability to provide for oneself and family, the lack of self-sufficiency, and the fear of economic loss and deprivation are also some of the prime drivers of social action. Perhaps the most potent example of the consequences of the depletion of internal and external resources was the actions of Mohammed Bouazizi, a street vendor, in Tunisia on December 17, 2010. He, after having had his wares confiscated by municipal workers, set fire to himself, thus setting in motion the events that led to the Arab Spring (Dupont and Passy, 2011).",

In Cairo, Egypt, citizens who were injured in political demonstrations reported higher levels of psychiatric symptoms than patients who experienced physical trauma from other causes. In both groups (N=120 each), similar levels of perceived external control over life (e.g., other important persons, fate, chance) were reported and predicted higher symptoms, suggesting the adverse impact of possible depletion of personal resources (Papanikolaou et al., 2013).",

            "text": "There is limited study of the psychological and health impact of political movements with reference to resource loss (de la Sablonni\u00e8re et al., 2013). Prior studies reported the association between resource loss and psychological functioning during major social upheaval. Among 145 Russian women in the midst of Russian economic transition, loss of economic resources (e.g., housing, stable employment) predicted depressive symptoms both directly and indirectly through a reduction of a personal sense of mastery over their life situations (Shteyn et al., 2003). Among Israeli settlers (N=190) who had faced terrorism and armed conflict and were subsequently evacuated by force from Gaza, a place that provided them with economic compensation and ideological and religious meaning, loss of economic resources (e.g., economic suffering, property damage) predicted clinically significant depressive symptoms, whereas loss of personal and social resources (e.g., confidence in coping with major crises, social intimacy) predicted both depressive and posttraumatic stress symptoms (Hall et al., 2008). A recent population-representative study conducted among 643 adults living in the Palestinian Authority found that the most salient predictor of new cases of posttraumatic stress disorder was social resource loss (Hall et al., 2015). A study among 4838 East and West Germans found that loss of social and economic resources (e.g., partner relationships, standard of living) between 1986 and 1996 after the fall of the Berlin Wall predicted lower life satisfaction and higher negative affect (Westerhof and Keyes, 2006).",

A Computer-Assisted Telephone Interview system was used. A database of the telephone numbers from the latest residential telephone directories was created by erasing the last two digits and appending two random digits to each number. This method allowed new or unlisted telephone numbers to be included. A person was considered eligible if he/she was (1) a Hong Kong Chinese Citizen, (2) 18 years of age or above, and (3) Cantonese-speaking. If multiple household members were eligible after successful contact, the one with the closest birthday to the interview date was selected. Five attempts were made to a number that were \u201cno answer,\u201d \u201cbusy,\u201d or \u201celigible unavailable\u201d (i.e., willing to participate but unavailable) while no further attempts were made following two refusals. Voluntariness of participation without incentives was emphasized. Oral informed consent was obtained at the onset of interview. All interviews were conducted in Cantonese. Among the total 34,101 telephone numbers attempted, 18,053 (52.9%) of them were ineligible based on the inclusion criteria; 14,168 (41.5%) were unconfirmed eligible, meaning that they were never reached and their status as eligible or not was never evaluated. Among the 1880 (5.5%) eligible numbers, interviews were completed for 1208 (64.3%), whereas 533 (28.4%) indicated refusal and 139 (7.4%) indicated unavailability. The sampling error was within \u00b12.8% at 95% confidence level. A response rate of 38% was recorded along with a cooperation rate of 69.4%.",

Two months after the conclusion of the Umbrella Movement in Hong Kong, this study found an alarming 47.30% of moderate to severe levels of anxiety symptoms and almost 15% of moderate to severe depressive symptoms among 1208 respondents, though the majority (>90%) did not report \u201cpoor/very poor\u201d self-rated health (Hypothesis 1). Pertinent to Hypothesis 2, multivariable regressions showed that loss of personal resources was positively associated with the odds of higher anxiety symptoms and poorer self-rated health, whereas loss of both personal and social resources was positively associated with the odds of higher depressive symptoms. Proxies of lower socioeconomic resources including primary education or below, lower household income, and being unmarried were also positively associated with the odds of higher anxiety/depressive symptoms and poorer self-rated health (Hypothesis 3).

The most representative data on self-reported anxiety symptoms to date was obtained from 4481 Hong Kong residents at multiple timepoints following the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 (Leung et al., 2005). SARS generated considerable fear and psychological distress among people in the 29 affected regions (Hawryluck et al., 2004, Koh et al., 2005, Leung et al., 2003). Compared with the data that was obtained among Hong Kong Chinese two to three months after the outbreak of SARS (Leung et al., 2005), higher anxiety symptoms were reported by almost all age groups in this study (\nTable 4). In a similar vein, compared with the PHQ-9 data on depressive symptoms among a population-based sample of 16,039 Hong Kong Chinese (Nan et al., 2013), higher percentage of depressive symptoms were observed in mild (N=272, 22.5%), moderate (N=116, 9.6%), moderately severe (N=37, 3.1%), and severe (N=21, 1.7%) levels in the present sample (\nTable 5). On the other hand, we found that only 9.11% of the respondents reported \u201cpoor/very poor\u201d self-rated health, which was obviously low compared with population-based data among Chinese in Hong Kong (49.2%, N=4553; Wang et al., 2013), Shanghai (36.2%, N=2040; Jia et al., 2014), and Singapore (24.3%, N=3704; Lim et al., 2007). This could be because Umbrella Movement was short and nonviolent. It is likely that physical health impact is greater in more prolonged and violent cases like Yemen and Syria.",

A population-based survey during the Umbrella Movement (N=1050) reported that 38% of the respondents expressed a pessimistic view over the future of Hong Kong, 43% expressed disagreement with the current Chief Executive election proposal (i.e., candidates are selected by a Nomination Committee consisting of 1200 members), and 53% agreed that the government should back down to resolve the situation (The Chinese University of Hong Kong, 2014). The Umbrella Movement did not lead to any concrete political outcomes, while the Hong Kong government has refused to make changes to the current Chief Executive election proposal. Worries of respondents could have been manifested in lower levels of optimism and a sense of mastery over one\u2019s life and future success. If the current election proposal is implemented or Hong Kong citizens do not adjust their expectation, ongoing personal resource loss could demonstrate increased health impact.",

Like recovery from PTSD, recovery from depressed mood could depend heavily on prevention of social resource loss or restoration of lost social connections following social\u2013political upheaval (Hall et al., 2014). Social resource loss could be attributed to everyday political discussions with close social partners. The Umbrella Movement encouraged spirited debate and polarized opinions that may have disrupted social harmony. Discussions could increase the probability of agreement among close social partners (Morey et al., 2012), but \u201cuniversal suffrage\u201d was made ambiguous by granting Hong Kong citizens the right to vote and the right to be elected but not the right to nominate candidates. Because of the ambiguity of the issue, the chance of political disagreement increases, while strong ties encourage confrontation of political disagreement that could inadvertently reduce relationship strength and intimacy (Huckfeldt et al., 2004).",

These socioeconomic resources take time to accumulate within the local setting and thus were not easily shaken by the Umbrella Movement. On the other hand, economic resource loss indicates specific loss of adequate income, financial assets, and financial stability since the start of the Movement. The findings extend the well-established link between socioeconomic status and physical and mental health to political psychology (Adler et al., 1994). In milder cases of pro-democracy movements, longstanding socioeconomic resources, not momentary loss of income or financial stability, could have a stronger association with mental and physical health.",

First, because this study was cross-sectional in nature, we cannot determine causality from the associations between resource loss and outcome variables. Psychological distress could indeed increase resource loss, which then reciprocally enhances psychological distress, forming a loss spiral during political violence (Heath et al., 2012, Hall et al., 2015). Second, the telephone survey relied on self-reports. Response bias and social desirability could influence respondents' answers and discount data validity especially on psychiatric symptoms. However, phone-based structured clinical interviews have been found to be a valid method for detecting and monitoring psychiatric symptoms (Hobfoll et al., 2011, Muskens et al., 2014). Third, potential confounders such as preexisting mental and physical health issues and concurrent predictors like exposure to the Umbrella Movement were not assessed. Unmeasured confounders could dilute the associations between predictors and outcomes, whereas concurrent predictors like exposure to the Movement could accelerate different resource losses.",

One common feature across pro-democracy movements around the world is protestors' willingness to invest internal and external resources in order to resist oppressive rule and create passageways for social and political resources (Hobfoll, 2012, Pearlman, 2013). In more successful cases of pro-democracy movements, like those of Tunisia, Jordan, and Morocco, protests were relatively shorter and probably caused less psychological and health problems to the peoples. Resource loss among these peoples is down regulated by the positive political outcomes and opportunity of resource gain. Meanwhile, in many places with pro-democracy movements, such as Syria (United Nations, 2015), protests are on-going and yet to result in political success or stability, bringing about more resource loss than opportunity of gain to the peoples. Depletion of resources could have a more significant negative impact on the peoples\u2019 physical and mental health.",
