The R\n0 was estimated as 2.2,\n8\n 3.8,\n11\n and 2.68\n12\n by different research all round the world. The WHO published an estimated R\n0 of 1.4 to 2.5.\n13\n\nR\n0, the basic reproductive number, is defined as the expected number of additional cases that one case will generate, on average without external intervention. R\n0 value is usually applied to reflect the potential and severity of infectious diseases. The larger R0 is, the stronger the transmission power will be. If R0 is less than 1, it means that the disease will gradually die out.\n14\n Despite all of the results of the nCoV, the epidemic kept in a constant state of change, especially after the rigorous measures have been taken by Chinese government, so it calls for more comprehensive research such as updated R\n0 estimates, more appropriate index under the circumstances of intervention such as effective reproductive number (R), methodological improvements, and effect evaluation of control measures to reflect the dynamic and progress of it. In this study, we provided the latest distributions of COVID\u201019 in Wuhan, China, and the whole world.

Since there was no vaccine at present, we assumed that everyone was susceptible. The number of infected people (including those who have been cured and quarantined) in the total population was very small, so the proportion of susceptible people could be approximately considered as constant. In this way, we established the link between R and R\n0 according to the reported case data and analyzed the trend by Dickey\u2010Fuller Test, which showed a rise from 20 to 30 January, a decline from 31 January to 11 February, a short rebound on 12 February and another continuous decline from 13 to 29 February.

The number of new confirmed cases in Hubei province on 12 February was 148 40 (of which 13 332 were clinically diagnosed), which was an extraordinary large increase compared to an average of 2391 cases from 1 to 11 February (Table S2). That accounted for the temporary rebound of R. The government interventions (wearing masks, timely quarantine, improved therapeutic strategy, etc) reduced probability of infection per exposure (\u03b20), decreased frequency of exposure (k), and shortened the average recovery time (Te), thus contributing to the decline of R.

This could be achieved by the public health emergency response and interagency mechanism. China's public health emergency response is categorized into four levels, with level I being the highest. Level 1 means the provincial disease control headquarters, in the event of a particularly serious public health emergency, will conduct emergency response work under the decisions and command of the State Council. Initiating public health emergency response and establishing a nationwide interagency mechanism was beneficial for monitoring the implementation of the early detection, early isolation, and early treatment. Another critical factor in enhancing early detection was the improvement of diagnosis method. Nucleic acid tests accounted for a big proportion of the initial pathogenic diagnosis techniques because of the convenience and rapidity, nevertheless, nucleic acid tests had returned false\u2010negative results for people infected with the nCoV, with a 30% to 50% positive rate. Those patients with pneumonia symptoms and virus infection by the lung image but negative result by nucleic acid test were called \"false\u2010negative.\" Caution should be taken against \"false\u2010negative\" because its harm was self\u2010evident. It would not only delay the timely treatment of infected patients, but also cause some patients with less symptoms to circulate in the society because they thought they were not infected so as to increase the probability of other people's infection. Therefore, it was of great importance to introduce the clinical diagnosis in addition to nucleic acid tests in the fourth phase of government measures. The Chinese health authorities issued the fifth version of diagnosis and treatment plan for COVID\u201019.\n34\n According to the updated criteria, suspected cases with imaging characteristics of pneumonia could be clinically diagnosed as COVID\u201019 in Hubei province. In this way, patients could receive standardized treatment as soon as possible, aiming to further improve the success rate of treatment and contain the spread of the epidemic. Second, patients should be admitted to designated hospitals and comprehensive treatment strategy including antiviral therapy, respiratory support, circulatory support, and immunity enhancement should be adopted for those who were critically ill. The initial surge of cases in Wuhan made it difficult for the hospital capacity to meet the demand; therefore, beside the current designated medical institutions, Wuhan learned from Beijing's successful experience during the fight against SARS in 2003 and built two new temporary hospitals\u2014Huoshenshan Hospital and Leishenshan Hospital, which were designed to have a capacity of 1000 beds and 1500 beds, respectively. Third, adequate medical supplies, such as health professionals, masks, protective suits, and coronavirus test kits, should be guaranteed, otherwise insufficient medical resources may resulted in the sharp rise of the COVID\u201019 patients.",

The actual number of infected patients was not exactly the same as the number of reported cases on that day, and there may be some missing reports and undetected cases. Since the actual number of infected and suspected patients was not observable, there must be some unavoidable discrepancy between the confirmed patients and actual number of infection, which lead to the inevitable deviation of the estimation. Though we adopted the model in the addition of latency, it did not account for the infectiousness during incubation period, so it may reduce the accuracy as a consequence. The travel of people flow between different regions was not well considered, especially the migration after the Spring Festival\u2014back to work and back to school. Sensitivity analysis suggested that effective drug therapy could have great influence on the intervention result, it would have been more comprehensive if the study could have included the effect of antiviral treatment. Finally, our research was a data\u2010driven analysis, with data coming from heterogeneous sources, which would definitely introduce inevitable bias, therefore care should be taken in the interpretation of the results.",

The declines in the dynamic trend of effective reproductive number (R) indicated the effectiveness of four\u2010phase stringent government measures. It is an unprecedented outbreak of coronavirus in the 20th century, which is not exactly the epidemic of a single country, more a public concern of the whole world; therefore, more international cooperation are required to combat the nCoV, focusing on both persistent strict domestic interventions and vigilance against exogenous imported cases.",
