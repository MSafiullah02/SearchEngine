One ED (\u201cED A\u201d) relied exclusively on log and record review, rather than clinician-completed checklists. There was a wide range in the proportion of syndrome visits to overall visits reported by EDs (0.04% to 2.8%). The highest proportion of syndrome visits to total visits was reported by ED A, but it cannot be determined whether this was coincidental or because centralized record review produced superior case ascertainment.",

However, we evaluated the accuracy of Web reporting by reviewing the concordance between electronic summaries and checklists retained in the EDs. On several days, some EDs reported more syndrome visits on regional emergency medicine Internet than were reflected by syndrome-positive checklists and on other days, fewer. These overreported and underreported 24-hour totals almost completely cancelled one another and were due to 1-day differences between the actual patient visit (recorded on the checklist) and the date on which the regional emergency medicine Internet was used to report the case. Thus, they did not bias overall temporal incidence trends. Disparities in reports of rarer conditions occasionally resulted in alarming syndrome rates, requiring telephone follow-up with the affected ED. For example, one ED reported 3 \u201ccentral nervous system infection\u201d cases in 1 day, representing 43% of total central nervous system infection reports throughout the 4-week surveillance period. A telephone call was sufficient to ascertain that this was keystroke error (confirmed by review of checklists and triage logs). Such events were evaluated rapidly by telephone contact without the need for public health staff to visit the ED or for other excessive staff time. They also indicate that a modest sustained (3-day) or sharp increase in the numbers or proportions of persons with syndromes in the region would likely be detected, despite the observed inconsistencies in screening and reporting practices.",

This process change required cooperation from a smaller number of ED staff and provided greater control of the forms in a single location. EDs were also asked to collect forms in midnight-to-midnight batches and directly record on the regional emergency medicine Internet screen the date for which daily visit totals were reported. With these changes, the use of a more simplified screening tool, and possibly a learning effect from the previous ED experience with All Star Game surveillance, the early SARS project experience indicates greater ease and consistency of screening and reporting.",

The mean estimate of added staff time for the surveillance project was 9 minutes per patient (range 3 to 25 minutes). Systematic measurements of time are not yet available for the SARS project, but initial observations suggest the simpler screening and reporting system are efficient. When the SARS screening tool is used only for patients with measured fever or history of fever, only 5% to 8% of overall patients have a screening form completed. Observations suggest that completion of this form requires less than 3 minutes, and it takes a staff person 5 minutes to enter the 24-hour counts on the regional emergency medicine Internet each day.
