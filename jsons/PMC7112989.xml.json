One best practice identified through ICU director comments was the manual documentation of ICU resource requirements for each patient on a ruled pad of paper during evacuation.

These facts allowed us to analyze our survey with some confidence to identify important associations and lessons that may help to inform future ICU evacuation practices.

Although most institutions surveyed had participated in regional evacuation planning and had significant advance warning of Hurricane Sandy\u2019s landfall, leadership coordination and communication remained significant problems. Triage and prioritization decisions for ICU patient evacuation were generally still determined locally, and most providers performing these activities were not designated leaders and had little or no practical training. It is significant to note that institutional evacuation planning may not always involve the ICU director, because disaster preparedness efforts are often focused on the emergency department. This may create a management challenge for critically ill patients, who are generally the most vulnerable during an evacuation and frequently require specific subject matter expertise to effectively deliver their complex care. The insufficient and slow dissemination of critical information may contribute to continued challenges in creating efficient, streamlined disaster evacuations.",

For large or late evacuations like Hurricane Sandy, these resources should be reported by each hospital within the region to a centralized Incident Command System or regional evacuation command center.\n25\n The Incident Command System can determine how to best utilize the existing resources and will be responsible for coordination using stereotyped evacuation patterns based on volume, severity, and special needs of critically ill patients.\n22\n\n,\n\n26\n Our survey results also suggest that continuity of provider care throughout the patient transfer process contributed to the overall perception of safer care. A priori regional credentialing of appropriate ICU staff as part of the overall disaster plan could avoid the challenges of emergency credentialing that the Hurricane Sandy ICU providers and hospitals faced.",

The fact that respondents more frequently reported the use of routine transfer forms over disaster forms represents either suboptimal preparation, with the potential for process improvement, or poor correlation between the content and structure of the forms and real-time documentation requirements. The use of disaster forms should be either reconsidered or studied more critically in simulated and real-time events. Lessons from Haiti and Toronto suggest that electronic tracking may be more effective than paper forms\n36\n\n,\n\n37\n; however, disaster conditions (such as those that existed in Hurricane Sandy) may necessitate a manual or paper version. If a decision is made to continue working with disaster forms, the staff should undergo appropriate training and routinely practice the use of these forms. Detailed planning and realistic drills using likely disaster scenarios increase successful individual performance.\n30\n\n,\n\n38\n Communication and leadership are frequently cited challenges to effective ICU management and evacuation following a disaster. The experience from survey respondents following Hurricane Sandy highlights the importance of a critical care team or unit leader, who can maintain real-time situational awareness of the quantity, severity, resource requirements, special equipment, and transport needs of multiple critically ill patients and communicate this information effectively to the Incident Command System. The critical care unit leader role in the Hospital Emergency Incident Command System was eliminated under the new Hospital Incident Command System, and revision\n28\n\n,\n\n29\n\n,\n\n38\n of this change according to the Hurricane Sandy experience warrants serious consideration.

We also did not allow providers to self-rate their performance in terms of patient care, although responses in support of excellent patient safety outcomes indirectly addressed this. A complete description and analysis of the complex events and ICU evacuation responses following Hurricane Sandy is clearly not possible by using a simple survey tool. Owing to financial limitations and sheer geographic distance, we were forced to conduct our study remotely. A major limitation to our study was the participation of only 4 of 7 area hospitals affected by this storm, and the associated risk of selection and response biases. Although we attempted to highlight a variety of subspecialty ICU types, we primarily captured responses from medical ICUs as a result of the sampling methods. Future studies could aim to provide more responses from neonatal, pediatric, medical, cardiac, and other ICUs.",

By definition, data collected in a disaster situation are frequently limited and nonuniform, raising concerns regarding the public relations and medical-legal ramifications of submitting this information to public scrutiny. Developing clear guidelines for minimum elements of data collection to consider in these situations and an anonymous reporting system at the national or international level may help to facilitate more comprehensive study and understanding of best practices for ICU evacuation that may aid providers and improve patient outcomes in future disaster events.",

Disaster planning and preparation at the ICU level continues to represent an area for improvement, especially in the area of vertical evacuation. Early initiation of patient evacuation efforts led to greater communication and coordination both within and between hospitals, but still left room for improvement in the areas of communication and leadership, especially in the area of patient distribution. Triage, prioritization, and documentation processes were highly variable, and emergency credentialing was frequently necessary to provide patients with the care that they needed during and after transport to new facilities. Phones, flashlights, and portable ventilators are important, high-yield resources that could be targeted for preparation in the event of future ICU evacuations. Many other areas for improvement above could be addressed by better efforts to incorporate ICU providers into hospital evacuation planning and training efforts. A possible solution to improve the ICU processes observed in this event includes the creation of standardized evacuation communication processes and documentation tools, managed by a critical care unit leader who coordinates care and plays a defined and integrated role in the Incident Command System. The development of a standard, uniform database utilized by all evacuating hospitals during a disaster could also better inform patient and system outcomes to further advance critical care evacuation practices in the future.",
