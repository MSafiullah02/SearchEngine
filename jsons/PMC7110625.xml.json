            "text": "One of the major difficulties in early diagnosis of respiratory infectious diseases lies in the presentation of patients with similar symptoms that can be caused by a wide variety of pathogens, some of which cause minor self-limiting illnesses while others can cause life-threatening complications. The 2003 epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus and the recent outbreaks of a highly pathogenic avian influenza virus A (H5N1) among poultry in eight Asian countries are reminders of the ever-present risks from respiratory pathogens [1]. Based on the WHO report of May 29, 2006, there have been 224 of laboratory-confirmed human cases and 127 deaths mostly in Asia caused by avian influenza A (H5N1) since December 2003 (http://www.who.int/en/). Deaths occurred in otherwise healthy young individuals, which is reminiscent of the 1918 Spanish influenza pandemic. Infection with influenza viruses can result in illness ranging from mild to severe and life-threatening complications [2], [3]. Influenza virus A belongs to the Orthomyxoviridae family of segmented, negative-stranded RNA viruses and has the potential to cause pandemics [4], [5]. The bacterium Streptococcus pneumoniae is a major cause of bacterial pneumonia, meningitis, otitis media, and sinusitis. Influenza virus A and S. pneumoniae represent two different classes of respiratory disease pathogens. Because influenza, pneumonia and other respiratory infections can cause similar flu-like symptoms, it is difficult to tell the difference between them based on symptoms alone. There are many subtypes of influenza viruses and many serotypes of pneumococci, hence diagnosis of so many different agents directly for early detection and differentiation of etiologic agents does not seem practical. During a respiratory illness outbreak such as influenza pandemics, early detection of respiratory pathogens can be very important in determining the cause of the outbreak.",

Differences in gene expression are responsible for morphological and phenotypic differences as well as indicative of cellular responses to environmental stimuli and perturbations. The complex host-pathogen interaction is the underlying basis of infectious diseases. Microarray profiles for microbial infection could lead to the better understanding of host-pathogen interactions and the identification of biomarkers for specific microbial infection and ultimately yield important diagnostic tools [8]. Recently, it has been demonstrated that cDNA microarrays can be used to characterize exposure of animals to specific chemical classes [9], which provides the basis for development of similar expression profiles of animals exposed to different pathogens.",

Microarray analysis performed on lung tissues isolated from mice infected with a recombinant influenza A/WSN/33 virus expressing HA and NA genes of the 1918 pandemic virus [12] and mice infected with pneumonia virus of mice [13] showed activation of many genes involved in the inflammatory response including cytokine genes. The combination of microarray and the use of model animals is a suitable strategy to explore the gene expression profiles and should provide a useful system to identify new targets for detection of respiratory pathogens and clinical investigation. Detection of differentially expressed host genes in response to respiratory infections could be a valuable tool for the differential diagnosis of diseases particularly in the early stages of infection. Identification of mouse model biomarkers for respiratory tract diseases is an important step towards identification of human biomarkers that could eventually lead to tests for early diagnosis of respiratory tract infections.",

Image segmentation, target detection, and ratio calibration methods were used to report the expression ratios of each gene on the slides [15]. The ratio calibration was performed based on pre-selected internal control genes, of which ratios were normalized close to the value of 1.0. A 99% confidence interval was used to determine significantly up and down expressed genes [15]. The complex images were converted into numerical data for statistic analysis of the expression levels. Data from the hybridization experiment were viewed as a normalized ratio (Cy5/Cy3) in which significant deviations from 1 (no change) are indicative of increased (>1.5) or decreased (<0.66) levels of gene expression in infected mice relative to uninfected mice. To explore the similarity and dissimilarity between samples and genes, supervised clustering algorithms were applied [16], [17]. Briefly, genes in each microarray experiment were first filtered according to their measurement quality. After data filtration, high quality and differentially expressed genes were subjected to clustering software developed by Xueyan Bai and Yan A.

The reaction mixture contained a total volume of 50 \u03bcl including both tested gene and control gene primer pairs at a concentration of 1 \u03bcM and tested gene and control gene probes at a concentration of 0.2 \u03bcM. The thermal cycling consisted of 48 \u00b0C for 30 min for reverse transcription, 95 \u00b0C for 10 min for denaturation, and 50 cycles of 95 \u00b0C for 15 s and 60 \u00b0C for 1 min for amplification. Tested gene amplification results in a signal from the FAM emission wavelength (518 nm) and control gene amplification produces a signal from the VIC emission wavelength (552 nm). A positive RT-PCR is measured by the cycle number required to reach the cycle threshold (C\nT). The C\nT is defined as 10 times the standard deviation of the mean baseline emission calculated for PCR cycles 3 to 15 [19].

Spleen is the largest lymphatic system organ that contains germinal centers in which B lymphocytes proliferate, macrophages that ingest and process antigens, and regions that house several kinds of T lymphocytes. Signs of illness such as weight loss and lethargy were measured daily after infection. Symptoms of infection peaked between 2 and 3 days and mice recovered by day 7. Total RNAs isolated from uninfected or infected mice were labeled separately with Cy3-dUTP or Cy5-dUTP and hybridized to cDNA microarray containing 15,000 mouse genes, as described in Section 2. Hybridization intensity for each gene on the microarray was compared with the uninfected control samples. The relative abundance of transcripts from each gene was reflected by the ratio of \u2018green\u2019 to \u2018red\u2019 fluorescence measured at the array element representing that gene. The greater relative abundance of mRNA in mouse infected with pathogens resulted in a higher ratio of green-labeled to red-labeled copies of the corresponding cDNA. Genes whose relative transcription levels increased by >1.5-fold were considered as up-regulated, and whose relative transcription levels less than 0.66 were considered as down-regulated. Genes whose relative transcription levels were between 0.66 and 1.5 were considered as no change.",

Among the 490 identified genes, 285 were known genes, 76 were ESTs with GeneID and 129 were ESTs without GeneID. There were more genes differentially expressed in mice infected with S. pneumoniae than in mice infected with influenza virus A, which suggests more genes may be involved in the host defense against S. pneumoniae infection. We focused our analysis on those genes with available known functions for all microarray studies described in this report. Differentially expressed known genes in response to influenza virus A or S. pneumoniae were sorted into seven groups according to their functions: 127 encoded proteins involved in metabolism, 107 encoded proteins involved in signal transduction, 86 encoded proteins related to protein translation or processing, 85 encoded proteins for transcription or RNA binding/splicing, 37 encoded proteins involved in cell division, 36 encoded structure proteins, and 22 encoded proteins related to defense and immunity (\nFig. 1).

GATA binding protein 1 modulates cytokine signals through protein-protein interactions, and inhibiting STAT3, thereby regulating the growth and survival of hematopoietic cells and may represent a novel MAPK substrate that plays an essential role in a cytokine-mediated antiapoptotic response. Cell division 42 homolog can mediate insulin signaling to GLUT4 translocation and was activated by IL-3. The Frag1 signal pathway, by linking replication stress surveillance with apoptosis induction, plays a central role in determining whether DNA damage is compatible with cell survival or whether it requires cell elimination. Protein kinase C nu is an important component of signaling pathways downstream from protein kinase C enzymes after B-cell receptor engagement. Discs large homolog 1 may have a role coordinating T-cell receptor/CD28-induced actin-driven T-cell synapse assembly, signal transduction, and effector function. Heat shock protein 1 beta plays a critical role in types I and II interferon pathways and the hsp90 chaperone-dependent MEK1/2-ERK pathway is required for B cell antigen receptor-induced cyclin D2 expression in mature B lymphocytes [20].",

Integrin linked kinase (Ilk) has a role in immune-cell trafficking and survival via modulation of Akt- and Rac-dependent substrates, and have implications for cell recruitment in both homeostatic and pathological processes [25]. Glutathione peroxidase 1 (Gpx1) functions as the primary protection against acute oxidative stress and has a role in modulating molecular pathways involved in both cell death and inflammatory cascades in brain following injury. Glutathione peroxidase 4 (Gpx4) plays a role in vivo in the mechanism of apoptosis induced by oxidative stress that most likely occurs through oxidative damage to mitochondrial phospholipids such as cardiolipin [26]. Heat shock protein 90 kDa beta member 1 (Hsp90b1) is an inflammatory mediator that selectively primes CD8+ T-cell effector function. Prothymosin alpha (Ptma) induces functional maturation and interleukin-12 (IL-12) production by fungus-pulsed dendritic cells through the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase/nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB-dependent pathway, which occurs by signaling through the myeloid differentiation factor 88-dependent pathway, involving distinct Toll-like receptors [27]. Mapk3 plays a role in regulation of epidermal chemokine expression and skin inflammation [28] as well as many other functions. Janus kinase 1 and 2 (Jak1/2) are client proteins of Hsp90 alpha and beta (Hspcb); Hsp90 and CDC37 play a critical role in types I and II interferon pathways [29]. Jak1 and Jak2 must work cooperatively and their actions are dependent on having normal kinase activity to trigger downstream signals leading to interleukin-3 independent proliferation [30]. Protein kinase X-linked (Prkx) is involved in several signaling pathways including Calcium, WNT, MAPK and Insulin pathways. Catenin is involved in WNT receptor signaling pathway and leukocyte transendothelial migration. Taken together, these results revealed that the most dramatic differences in microarray profiles between infections with influenza virus A and S. pneumoniae were observed at day 1 post-infection, and they suggested that many important events related to intracellular signaling pathways and pathogenesis occur early in infection.",

In this study, the host gene expression profiles in spleens of mice infected with two different respiratory pathogens (influenza virus A and S. pneumoniae) were explored using cDNA microarray technology. We have identified 490 known and unknown genes that were differentially transcribed in mouse spleen in response to infections with influenza virus A and S. pneumoniae at day 1 and day 7 after infection, 285 were known genes, 76 were ESTs with GeneID and 129 were ESTs without GeneID. We found that many genes associated with cell metabolisms, intracellular signaling pathways, and gene/protein expression regulations were up-regulated or down-regulated in mice after infection. Among the 490 identified genes, some were exclusively up-regulated or down-regulated in response to only one of the two pathogens and some were shared by two pathogens. Our results demonstrated that host response to these two pathogens is very quick and gene expression profiles could be detected as early as 1 day after exposure to pathogens. We also found that 129 unknown genes were differentially expressed in mouse spleen after infection with influenza virus A and S. pneumoniae. It will be important to study these 129 unknown genes to characterize their functions in host response to respiratory pathogens such as influenza virus A and S. pneumoniae.",

Even though these genes were reported to be involved in the intracellular signaling pathways, most of them have not been linked to host responses to influenza virus A and S. pneumoniae infections. Studies are planned to correlate the genes identified in this report with those to be identified in human influenza patients to determine the contributions of these genes to influenza virus virulence and pathology.",

Most of these commonly up-regulated genes are involved in metabolisms and have not been linked to host responses to respiratory pathogens such as influenza virus A and S. pneumoniae. The group of commonly down-regulated genes include thioredoxin interacting protein gene (Txnip), ribosomal protein L32 gene (Rpl32), block of proliferation 1 gene (Bop1), cyclin D binding myb-like transcription factor 1 gene (Dmtf1), attractin gene (Atrn), ribosomal protein S19 gene (Rps19), cyclin I gene (Ccni), pyruvate kinase gene (Pkm2) and putative serine/threonine kinase gene (Prkx).

Recently, Kash et al. performed microarray analysis on lung tissues isolated from mice infected with a recombinant influenza A/WSN/33 virus expressing HA and NA genes of the 1918 pandemic virus (1918HA/NA:WSN), WSN and nonlethal New Caledonia HA/NA:WSN recombinant virus to compare microarray profiles [12]. Their results showed activation of many genes involved in the inflammatory response including cytokine genes. We decided to compare their results with the genes identified in this study to determine if there is any overlap between the two studies. In that paper, Kash et al. listed 102 genes (65 genes with names and 37 ESTs) without giving GeneID from mice infected with three different viruses at 24 h post infection: 1918HA/NA:WSN (lethal), WSN (lethal) and New Caledonia HA/NA:WSN (nonlethal). We have focused on the 65 genes with names and known functions and compared them with genes identified in mice infected with influenza virus A/PR/8/34 at day 1 from our study. Among the 18 genes preferentially regulated in mice infected with all three influenza virus infections (1918HA/NA:WSN, WSN and New Caledonia HA/NA:WSN), we have found 10 genes with the same name or similar functions (55.6%) that were also preferentially regulated in mice infected with influenza virus A/PR/8/34 at day 1 in our study. The 10 overlap genes are: activating transcription factor 7 interacting protein (Atf3), apoptosis inhibitor survivin (Birc5), cell division cycle 2 homolog A (Cdc2a), glutathione synthetase (Gss), glutathione S-transferase pi2 (Gstp2), hemoglobin alpha adult chain 1 (Hba-a1), cell adhesion molecules integrin beta 1 (Itgb1), cell adhesion molecules integrin beta 4 (Itgb4), phospholipase c neighboring (Png) and solute carrier family 28 member 2 (Slc28a2). These 10 genes are probably common to both pathogenic and nonpathogenic H1N1 influenza A viruses such as A/South Carolina/1/18 (H1N1), A/Brevig Mission/1/18 (H1N1), A/WSN/33 (H1N1), A/New Caledonia/20/99 (H1N1) and A/PR/8/34 (H1N1).",

These two genes are cleavage and polyadenylation specific factor 2 (Cpsf2) and tumor necrosis factor (Tnf). We suggest that these two genes are important for pathogenesis of lethal strains of influenza A viruses. Only 1 out of 6 genes (16.7%) preferentially regulated in mice infected with 1918HA/NA:WSN (lethal) was found preferentially regulated in mice infected with influenza virus A/PR/8/34 at day 1 in our study. None of the four genes preferentially regulated in mice infected with New Caledonia HA/NA:WSN was affected in mice infected with influenza virus A/PR/8/34 at day 1 in our study. The comparison results suggest that there are some overlaps between the gene expression seen with A/PR/8/34 and the study with the virulent 1918HA/NA:WSN and WSN viruses but no overlap with that of the nonlethal strain of influenza virus New Caledonia HA/NA:WSN.",

When validated by different methods including quantitative RT-PCR [41], [42], Northern blotting [15], [43], [44], and protein expression [28], [29], most differentially expressed genes have been confirmed. For example, 49 (40%) of the mRNAs predicted to be increased and 23 (17%) of the mRNAs predicted to be decreased in response to cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection were confirmed by either Northern blot analysis or prior reports [45]. Many genes identified in this study have not been linked to respiratory infections before and it will be very important to validate the expression levels for these genes using real-time quantitative RT-PCR. Our real-time quantitative RT-PCR results are consistent with the direction of changes predicted by microarray analysis in 5 out of 8 genes (63%). The results of this study show that most differentially expressed genes identified by cDNA microarray can been confirmed by the real-time quantitative RT-PCR. The magnitude of change determined by microarray and real-time RT-PCR were somewhat different because of differences of the two methods.",

The 28 selected genes are good candidate biomarkers for distinguishing mice exposed to influenza virus A and S. pneumoniae by comparing signature patterns of gene expression. Detection of differentially expressed host genes in response to respiratory infections could be a valuable tool for the differential diagnosis of diseases particularly in the early stages of infection. Identification of mouse biomarkers for respiratory pathogens such as influenza virus A and S. pneumoniae is an important step towards identification of human biomarkers that could eventually be developed into diagnostic kits for early stage respiratory infections or targets for drug screening. It remains one of the most difficult challenges to correlate mouse model biomarkers to those found in humans and their eventual clinical applications. However, results from this study have provided a list of many candidate biomarkers that can be used for further testing to determine the potential use for human diagnosis, prevention and treatments of respiratory infections including influenza viruses.

Results from this study have also provided a list of 28 candidate biomarkers that can be used for further testing to determine the potential use for human diagnosis or treatment. In addition, the identification of genes that specifically regulated in mice in response to these two pathogens may provide insights into the mechanisms by which the host interacts with these pathogens and useful information about stage of diseases and selection of suitable treatments. The distinguishing features of this universally applicable novel approach are that the detection of pathogens is based on differences in host gene expression profiles in response to different pathogens instead of detecting pathogens directly, and infections can be detected at a very early stage.",
