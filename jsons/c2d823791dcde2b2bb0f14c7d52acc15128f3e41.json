This can help health and government authorities take the appropriate measures and implement suitable politics aimed at fighting and preventing it. Methods: A time-dependent dynamic SIR model inspired in a model previously used during the MERS outbreak in South Korea was used to analyse the time trajectories of active and hospitalized cases in Portugal. Results: The time evolution of the virus spread in the country was adequately modelled. The model has changeable parameters every five days since the onset of mitigation measures. A peak of about 19,000 active cases is estimated. Hospitalized cases could reach a peak of about 1,250 cases, of which 200-300 in ICU units. Conclusion: With appropriate measures, the number of active cases in Portugal can be controlled at about 19,000 people, of which about 1,250 hospitalized and 200-300 in ICU units. This seems manageable by the country's national health service with an estimated 1,140 ventilators.",

In the most severe cases, the virus Sars-CoV-2 infection can lead to the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) causing respiratory failure, septic shock, multiorgan failure, and even death [6] . Studies suggest that the case fatality rate of the virus is of about 3.5% in mainland China [7] . However, this value seems to be much higher in Italy [8] , suggesting its strong dependence on demographics [9] . The WHO declared Europe as the new epicentre of the disease on the 13th of March of 2020[ [10] . The rapid growth of the number of active cases presenting severe symptoms has saturated the health services in most countries in the continent, especially in Italy [11] . Governments throughout Europe have implemented severe measures to prevent and mitigate the spread of the virus. Yet, as of the 6th of April there were as many as 646,340 confirmed cases on the European continent, resulting in 49,227 deaths [2, 3] .",

In the current analysis, instead of using set values from educated guesses as done in my previous work, the values of \u03b2, d and l are adjustable to the curve. In order to fit the results, four periods of five days each, from the 19th of March, were considered. In the first three periods, the same official data to fit the results was used. Initial conditions were taken from the previous period, and equation 1 was solved for the trajectory of the curve in the remainder of days in the same period. This procedure was performed for each period. This allowed for a dynamic follow-up of the trajectory, adjusting the parameters to the best possible fit to the curve in each period. The obtained results are summarized in table 6. A graphical depiction of the evolution of the obtained curve for infected cases is given in 5. For hospitalized cases, this is provided in figure 6. The last period corresponds to a prediction of the values for the five days following period 5 (10th to the 15th of April 2020).

SEIR models are effective in taking these measures into account by the insertion of one or two extra parameters.

It intends to provide tools for scientists to model the trajectory of active and hospitalized cases in the current pandemic. With this model, and although in earlier predictions the values were of \u223c13,000 active cases and \u223c2,500 hospitalized cases, it seems now that a maximum of \u223c19,000 active cases and \u223c1,250 hospitalized cases will or has already been reached in this period. The value of R ef f is now approaching one which means that in the next few days we will see the number of active cases starting to finally diminish. This model assumes that only symptomatic cases are being tested. Given that the number of tests in Portugal is now one of the highest in the World, it is very likely that non priority cases are also being tested now, which means that the model is starting to fail, as asymptomatic cases begin being tested. This could explain the plateau reached in the number of hospitalized cases, which, as we know represent 13% of the total number of symptomatic cases. If this hypothesis is proven to be correct, the country may have already reached the peak of active cases (both symptomatic and asymptomatic), but is simply testing asymptomatics now leading to an increase in the number of confirmed cases, but a constant number of hospitalized and ICU cases.",
