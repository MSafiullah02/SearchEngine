            "text": "Like influenza virus, many coronaviruses can use the endocytic pathway to enter cells [19]. Once inside the endosome, the challenge for viruses is delivering their genetic material across the membrane and into the cytosol for viral replication. All enveloped viruses have membrane proteins that facilitate the fusion of their lipid envelope with the host cell membrane [20]. Coronavirus particles possess at their surface the spike (S) envelope glycoprotein, which is a class I fusion protein [21]. Whereas the structure and function of the prototypical class I fusion protein, influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA), is well understood, structure\u2013function relationships for coronavirus S proteins are not well characterized. For coronaviruses, the S protein mediates virus entry and determines cell tropism and pathogenesis [22]. Like influenza virus HA, the coronavirus S protein has two primary functions: 1) it controls the binding of the virus to a cell membrane receptor, and 2) it mediates membrane fusion between the viral and host membranes [20]. In general, receptor binding is controlled by the S1 domain of the protein, while membrane fusion is mediated by the S2 domain. A conformational change in the S2 domain is believed to drive the viral membrane to fuse with the host membrane. For most coronaviruses, this conformational change is triggered by the acidification of the endosome, although pH-independent fusion can also be observed.",

            "text": "It is generally believed that all class I fusion proteins follow a common fusion pathway that has been well-established in the prototypical class I influenza virus. Class I fusion proteins go through a multi-step process to achieve a fusion pore that begins with a fusion protein conformational change triggered by low pH. During the conformational change the fusion protein unfolds and thrusts the fusion peptide into the hydrophobic region of the host membrane. Next, the protein folds back, bringing the anchored membrane in close contact with the viral membrane until a stalk-like structure is formed. The stalk structure results from the mixing of the outer leaflet of the host membrane with the viral membrane, referred to as hemifusion. After a short lag time, the stalk is converted into a fusion pore through which the viral contents can exit. It may be necessary for multiple fusion proteins to work in concert to bend the membrane to induce fusion.",

            "text": "Analogous to influenza HA, it is believed that the coronavirus S protein, undergoes proteolytic cleavage prior to fusion activation [22]. Proteolytic cleavage is believed to expose specific regions of the S protein, including the fusion peptide [23]. Because proteolytic cleavage dictates fusion competency, the availability of proteases in the extracellular milieu is another key factor in tropism of coronavirus. A dramatic example of this is human SARS-CoV. The bound virus is able to fuse at the cell surface in absence of acidic pH, when exposed to exogenous proteases [24]. This route of entry may even be 2 to 3 orders of magnitude more efficient that the endosomal pathway [24]. In this case, proteolytic cleavage changed the fusion pathway. By combining single particle fusion with proteinaceous supported bilayers and microfluidics, the sequence of triggers can be controlled and the associated fusion pathway and kinetics quantitatively measured.",

Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were washed twice with buffer A (2 mm CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl at pH 7.4). 3 ml of buffer B (2 mm CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 25 mm formaldehyde, 2 mm dithiothreitol (DTT) and 150 mm NaCl at pH 7.4) was added to each dish to induce cell blebbing. The dishes were then incubated for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C with gentle rocking. After incubation, the cell supernatant, containing detached cell blebs, was decanted into a 15 ml falcon tube and placed on ice for 20 min to allow any detached cells to settle out. The supernatant was transferred to new test tube. Blebs were then dialysed using cellulose dialysis tubing (Fischer Scientific), in two 100 ml volumes of buffer A for 24 h. The size of cell blebs was determined by dynamic light scattering using a Malvern Zetasizer Nano (Worcestershire, UK). The sample registered 3 peaks at approximately 38 nm, 106 nm, and 530 nm.",

For some coronaviruses, cleavage at S1/S2 is necessary to allow subsequent cleavage at S2\u2032, and allow the S2 domain to respond a low pH trigger that initiates the conformational change required for fusion [39].

Index-matching liquid (Carl Zeiss, Inc.) was used to couple the glass coverslip of the microfluidic device to the objective.

Exceeding the critical angle for glass/water interface (\u223c62\u00b0) ensured total internal reflection of the lasers and created evanescent waves about 100 nm thick.

We describe this self-assembly process here in the context of forming fAPN-supported bilayers (fAPN-SB) as substrates for FCoV fusion studies. The process is illustrated in Fig. 1\n(top) and begins with the formation of cell blebs containing fAPN. The detailed procedure for forming cell blebs containing fAPN from BHK cells can be found in the Methods section. fAPN blebs are then used to form proteinaceous supported bilayers, as will be described in detail next. Once the proteinaceous supported bilayer is formed, FCoV binds to fAPN, localizing the virus within the evanescent wave and enabling single particle fusion experiments that will be described in a later section.",

FRAP interrogates a macroscale area (\u223cmicrons) and thus is useful for characterizing how well the bilayer has formed over this length scale. Note that the largest population of blebs is on the order of 500 nm in diameter (Fig. S1), so if the blebs have not ruptured into a contiguous planar bilayer, then the fluorescence will not be able to recover after the sample is photobleached.

Other possibilities for the structure of the bilayer include partial bleb rupture (such as only the outer leaflet fusing to the BHK-liposomes). However, because the diffusion coefficients and mobile fractions in the pure BHK-liposome SLB and fAPN-SB bilayers are comparable, this structure can be ruled out by the following argument. If the blebs were only partially fused, then the R18 trapped in the inner leaflet could not readily exchange with the surrounding lipids after being photobleached. This behavior would manifest as a slower recovery and reduced mobile fraction, relative to the pure BHK-liposome case, over the same timescale of recovery experiment.",

What is clear from this data is that FCoV-1683 S cleaved with trypsin requires at least a mildly an acidic environment to fuse, but the rate dependence on pH is negligible.

In our previous single particle kinetics studies of influenza X-31 HA membrane fusion [7], we found hemifusion and pore formation rate constants at pH 4.5 of k\nH \u223c 0.2 s\u22121 and k\npore \u223c 0.08 s\u22121, respectively. Here, for FCoV S at the same pH, we obtain k\nH \u223c 0.05 s\u22121 and k\npore \u223c 0.07 s\u22121, respectively. One main difference we observe between HA and S is the pH-dependence of the hemifusion rate constant. FCoV-1683 S apparently requires an acidic environment to fuse, but the rate dependence on pH is negligible. Influenza, on the other hand, exhibits pH-dependent k\nH\n[5], [7]. However, the pore formation kinetics for both viruses is approximately the same. This result is not surprising because the pore formation step is not believed to be pH dependent [43], [44], but controlled to some extent by the physico-chemical properties (e.g., lipid composition, protein content, cholesterol quantity, etc.) of the membranes involved in fusion. Since cell blebs can be made from various cell types, the method presented here for forming supported bilayers from blebs also provides a new way to interrogate the impact of cell membrane type on viral fusion kinetics.",

N represents the number of steps in a multi-step scheme convoluted into a gamma distribution. In the case of influenza, N has been interpreted as the number of HA proteins that work in parallel to induce hemifusion [5], [7]. For influenza, N varies depending on the pH, but within the range of pH 4.0 to 6.0 is \u223c3 using the same experimental acidification conditions employed in these studies. In the case of FCoV S, if this interpretation was used, our data indicates that on average 1\u20132 S proteins are required to induce hemifusion across the same pH range. For this interpretation, a single S protein appears to have more energy stored within it to induce fusion compared to HA. An alternative interpretation is that N in this case simply means that \u223c1 step is dominating the kinetics, and that step apparently does not vary much with pH. Future experiments are required to shed more light on the mechanism of FCoV fusion and provide a conclusive interpretation of this parameter. Such studies are now ongoing in our laboratory.",

Because supported bilayers can be made from many cell types [14], [17], this method can be used to obtain kinetics of virus fusion as it depends on the kind of cell membrane host. In particular, for the many viruses that engage multiple receptors or co-receptors, this method allows the role of individual receptors to be defined in the context of the fusion event. Through biochemical means, proteins can be expressed or suppressed in the plasma cell membrane. Thus, supported bilayers can be tailor-made for fundamental studies of specific host-pathogen interactions that mitigate infection. In addition, by the incorporation of pseudoparticles [9], the method may be expanded to study viruses of high biomedical importance that require enhanced biosafety procedures (BSL-3 and BSL-4).",

Overall, the fusion results here recapitulate what is observed in vivo, that coronavirus entry requires binding to specific receptors and that membrane fusion is both receptor- and protease-dependent. These results indicate that the in vitro method described here is a suitable substitute for studying fusion in vivo, but our method of creating and combining proteinaceous bilayers with single particle tracking, now provides a convenient way to obtain quantitative kinetic rate parameters for intermediate steps in the coronavirus fusion pathway, which to our knowledge have not been obtained before. The single particle approach combined with microfluidics offers versatile control over the sequence of triggers of binding, protease exposure, and acidification. Control of the sequence of these triggers is important, as the order may define the fusion pathway, tissue tropism, and pathogenicity of coronaviruses. Systematically varying these complex triggers using this platform provides a new way to study this virus's ability to rapidly adapt to other hosts. Versatile platforms are of critical importance to providing data that can be leveraged to limit the infection of the human population, especially in light of the recently-emerging strain of MERS-CoV.",
