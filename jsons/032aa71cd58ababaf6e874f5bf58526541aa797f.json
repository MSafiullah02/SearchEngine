The general concept of studying virus structure in association with the host cell has recently been expanded to reveal interactions between viruses and the cytoskeleton. The procedure permits utilization of immuno-gold protocols using both the transmission and scanning electron microscopes. The grid-cell-culture technique is reviewed to explain how it can be exploited to provide valuable information about virus structure and replication in both diagnostic and research laboratories.",

If, for example, the cell cultures are critical point dried, then high cell confluency has minimal effect except that little or no areas of substrate are available for released viruses to adsorb and this clearly limits the possibility of examining extracellular and surface cell-associated viruses. Alternatively, if the cells are to be negatively stained and air dried then the presence of too many cells will result in splitting and destruction of the supportive film due to severe shrinkage of large numbers of cells. This problem can be rectified by reducing the number of cells and/or the application of slightly thicker films.",

            "text": "One of the earliest uses of critical point drying, in the study of animal viruses, involved purified oncornaviruses (De Harven et ~1.. 1973) . The success in visualizing viruses adsorbed to the grid was attributed to a combination of positive staining with uranyl acetate and critical point drying. The viruses were easily identified and resembled those in thin sections. Variations of this approach followed, including those of Malech and Wivel (1976) who critical point dried purified murine intracisternal A particles which had been adsorbed to filmed grids and shadowed them with platinum-iridium. Replicas of critical point dried and freeze dried cells have also been used to analyze the interaction of vesicular stomatitis virus (Birdwell and Strauss, 1974) and murine mammary tumour virus (Sheffield. 1981) with cells. Overall, these procedures have revealed cell-associated and budding viruses which have provided valuable information on virus morphology and topography of cell surface-associated viruses during morphogenesis. Critical point drying and examination of whole cells at 100 kV can reveal the threedimensional structure of cultured cells (Kilarski and Koprowski, 1976) . The lack of embedding media facilitates these observations and enables many intracellular and extracellular virus-cell interactions to be studied. The advantanges of this technique in virological studies were noted by Iwaski (1978) and include (a) rapid screening of both intracellular and extracellular aspects of numerous virus-infected cells and (b) in situ fixation of both released virions and those in the process of being released from host cells. The noted disadvantages of this technically simple procedure included the uncertainty about the identity of some intracellular structures and poor visibility of structures within the vicinity of the nucleus due to the thick central nuclear region.",

The colloidal gold catalyzes the reduction of silver ions in the developing solution to metallic silver resulting in the physical growth of the electron-dense gold markers. The major advantages of this adaptation are that the silver enhanced probes are easily observed at low magnifications by a conventional scanning electron microscope utilizing SE1 and/or BE1 (Fig. 16B ) and. as stated above, the avoidance of steric interference. Comparison between Figs 16A and 16B illustrate the increase in labelling obtained with the smaller probes. Details on post-fixation and coating procedures for these preparations are discussed by Hodges rt cd. When GCC are used in the above manner. analogous preparations can be viewed by TEM (Fig. 17) . For viral applications this will indicate the specificity of the \"background\" gold ~silver labelling.
