There are more than 1.5 million confirmed cases across almost every country in the world and at the time of writing (early April 2020) there were close to 100,000 recorded deaths.(1) The diagnosis of COVID-19 can be challenging and like any disease entity, a number of factors, including disease stage, disease prevalence, patient profile and sample type and quality, amongst other factors, can influence diagnostic test performance. In this review, we outline the performance outcomes of key tests used to diagnose COVID-19 and considerations that modulate performance. Safety of health-care workers collecting the samples, laboratory safety aspects and experimental approaches such as detection of volatile organic compounds in exhaled breath, mass spectrometry studies of different sample types, methods of signal amplification, and utility of other novel approaches are not discussed here.",

Relevant investigations will depend on the clinical context and will likely include pulmonary imaging, relevant laboratory investigations, blood cultures and interrogation of urine and/or lower respiratory tract specimens to rule in a viral, mycobacterial, fungal and/or a bacterial cause. Clinical and laboratory parameters that may suggest viral infection may include pyrexia, acute malaise and myalgia, and lymphopenia. C reactive protein (CRP) is unhelpful in distinguishing COVID-19 from other infections. Procalcitonin is elevated in severe COVID-19 and when there is secondary bacterial infection.(6,7) In early disease, procalcitonin may distinguish COVID-19 from bacterial infections but not from other viral diseases (data are awaited to confirm this supposition). In those with underlying asthma or COPD, the presence of pulmonary infiltrates may favour a respiratory infection-related cause though a cardiac cause must also be considered in the differential.",

There is already considerable shortage of reagents (and swabs) meaning that dry swabs are being sent to the laboratory in some centres. Dry swabs are less costly and more conducive to community-based testing, but data are urgently required to determine the comparative sensitivity of dry swabs compared to using viral transport medium (taking into account the time from sample acquisition to sample processing). Samples from the lower respiratory tract, including sputum, tracheal aspirate, bronchial washings and bronchoalveolar lavage, may also be sent. In patients with COVID-19 disease, samples from the lower respiratory tract are more likely to test positive (discussed below). Viral RNA can also be detected in stool in ~30% of cases and in blood in ~1% of cases (8) but rarely in urine.",

Depending on age and the presence of risk factors, ~10\u201320% of symptomatic persons may require admission to hospital because of respiratory or other complications. Individuals in this enhanced risk category may have one or more risk factors, including age greater than 50 years, comorbidities, history of significant tobacco smoking and underlying immunocompromising illnesses.(10,13) In mild disease, especially in the early stages, the RT-PCR false negative rate is ~30\u201340%.(8,14,15) A meta-analysis reported that a single test ~10 days post symptom development had a ~33% false negative rate using a nasopharyngeal swab (52.89% for a throat swab).(16) Ai et al. reported a false negative rate of 41% in a cohort of 1014 hospitalised patients; the estimated median interval between the initial negative test and subsequent positive RT-PCR result was 5.1 \u00b1 1.5 days.(17) A selection of other studies reported false negative rates of between 3 and 29%.(18\u201320) Notably, some patients required up to five repeat tests before a positive result was ascertained.(19) This false negativity phenomenon may be due to several factors, including a low viral load below the detection limit of the assay, low sample volume or cellular mass during acquisition, sampling location (upper versus lower respiratory tract), sample degradation during transport or storage, sample processing methodology and the timing of sampling in relation to the stage of the disease (RT-PCR positivity may progressively increase during the course of the disease).(14)",

In patients with more severe diseases, including those with lower respiratory tract infection, but also in individuals with mild disease, high viral loads can be detected often for several days after the resolution of symptoms.(23) The significance of this remains unclear though recent data from a limited number of patients suggest that RT-PCR positivity does not necessarily mean shedding of infectious virus after symptom resolution.(11) Zhifeng et al. demonstrated that RT-PCR using nasopharyngeal samples can be negative even when there is CT scan evidence of COVID-19 pneumonia.(24) Ali et al. showed an improvement in disease extent in 42% of CT scans prior to RT-PCR tests becoming negative.(17) It is unclear whether patients whose symptoms have resolved but who continue to have detectable viral RNA in respiratory samples can transmit infection. Furthermore, when symptoms have resolved, and especially given limited testing capacity, it remains unclear when patients may be discharged from ICU into the general ward setting or from hospital into the community setting, especially if there are other individuals with high-risk profiles living in the same household. Thus, there are no clearly defined guidelines about when it is safe for social mixing to occur after symptoms have resolved. Health-care workers\u2019 safety must be taken into account when collecting sputum and should ideally be performed in an infection-controlled environment, or in the open air in ambulant patients.",

However, interpretation algorithms differ with respect to the number of genes that need to be detected for the test to be considered positive. For some protocols, results are interpreted as indeterminate or negative if one of the genes is not detected, whereas for others, identification of one gene is used as screening test, while that of the subsequent gene(s) serves as a confirmatory test.(4) From a laboratory perspective, multiplexing of targets allows for better efficiency, shorter turn-around times and more optimal management of laboratory consumables.(26) Vogel et al. evaluated nine primer\u2013probe sets.(27) They confirmed that each pair had a detection efficiency of >90%, but there were differences in the ability to differentiate true negatives from positives in patients with a low viral load. Some sets led to inconclusive results due to non-specific background amplification (including the initial sets issued by the USA CDC but with subsequent rectification). With viral evolution, nucleotide substitutions may emerge that could affect primer/probe binding regions that could alter the sensitivity of PCR. Indeed, a potentially problematic mismatch in the RdRp-SARSr reverse primer has already been confirmed. Threshold cycle (Ct) value of the target gene remains the quantitative end point to ascertain viral load and depending on the kit used, this value generally lies in the 30\u201340 range.(4,27) To control for non-specific PCR inhibition, an internal positive amplification control (e.g. SARS-CoV-2 E-gene RNA, SARS-CoV Frankfurt 1 RNA) is included in the assay, whilst a negative control interrogates for contamination during sample preparation.",

Using this technique sensitivity was significantly improved from 28.2% by RT-PCR to 87.4% by RT-dPCR.(28) Moreover, 15/16 close contacts that were inconclusive with conventional RT-PCR (likely because not all the targets of interest were detected) were dPCR positive. The overall sensitivity, specificity and diagnostic accuracy of RT-dPCR was 90%, 100% and 93%, respectively. Moreover, the higher sensitivity of RT-dPCR translated into detection of viral RNA for longer periods compared to conventional RT-PCR in convalescing patients.

In HIV-infected patients presenting with a respiratory tract infection, the general possibilities outlined above have to be considered, including considering PCP and TB in the differential diagnosis. Although well documented, it is not widely appreciated that between 10 and 20% of community-acquired pneumonia or acute lower respiratory tract infection, in sub-Saharan Africa and parts of Asia, is due to Mycobacterium tuberculosis,(43\u201345) and this proportion is even higher in HIV-infected persons.(43,45) It is also possible that COVID-19 infection may unmask sub-clinical TB in both HIV-infected or uninfected persons. On the other hand, and particularly in HIV-infected persons, COVID-19 pneumonia, like in the case of influenza,(45) may be associated with a poorer prognosis in hospitalised patients with TB. Whether SARS-CoV-2 viral load will be higher in HIV-infected persons and therefore RT-PCR sensitivity better remains unclear. In HIV-uninfected persons co-infection with more than one pathogen has already been documented, e.g. co-infection with COVID-19 and influenza and/or bacterial organisms.(46) It is possible that co-infection with more than one pathogen may be more frequent in HIV-infected persons or those with advanced immunosuppression. These unanswered questions will only be resolved once more data become available.",

Although the mainstay of testing remains RT-PCR, there are several drawbacks, including a significant false negative rate in the early course of the disease, assay cost and lack of assay simplicity, and the requirement for complex laboratory infrastructure. There is an emerging shortage of reagents, including RNA extraction kits, that is likely to worsen; already many centres are using dry nasopharyngeal swabs because of the shortage of viral transport medium. Antibody-based immunoassays have been developed although they have a limited role in the early diagnosis of symptomatic patients. Their incremental benefit over RT-PCR assays and their role in other applications, including surveillance and targeting individuals for vaccination and redeployment into the workforce, are under investigation.",
