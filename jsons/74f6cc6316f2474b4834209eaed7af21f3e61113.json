Some quantitative studies have investigated this topic in spine surgery, but none has provided direct thematic feedback from physicians. This qualitative study aimed to identify the impact of this phenomenon in the practice of spine neurosurgeons. Methods We proposed a qualitative study using grounded theory approach. Twenty-three purposively selected private neurosurgeons participated. Inclusion took place until data saturation was reached. Data were collected through individual interviews and analyzed thematically and independently by three researchers (an anthropologist, a psychiatrist, and a neurosurgeon). Results Data analysis identified five superordinate themes that were based on items that recurred in interviews: (1) private practice of spinal surgery (high-risk surgery based on frequent functional symptoms, in an unfavorable medicolegal context);",

Selected quotes of interviews were reported to support these findings. Conclusions Our study highlights several elements that can alter the quality of care in a context of societal change and the judicialization of medicine. The alteration of the doctor-patient relationship and the permanent pressure of a possible complaint encourage surgeons to adopt defensive attitudes in order to minimize the risks of litigation and increased insurance premiums. These phenomena can affect the quality of care and the privacy of physicians to the extent that they may consider changing or interrupting their careers earlier.",

This inductive process (starting from the observation rather than from preexisting theories) was performed independently by three researchers with different backgrounds (an anthropologist, a psychiatrist, and a surgeon) so that we could triangulate our different perspectives and attend systematically to our own effects as researchers at each step of the process [15] .

Moreover, several physicians highlighted a tacit shift for patients from the obligation of means to the obligation of result: bad results are no longer tolerated, and this can lead to defensive practices. The patient is not seen as an \"enemy\" [33] , but socio-professional subgroups are designated as at risk and induce the physician's mistrust or outright refusal of care. It has been shown, particularly in the USA, that the poorest patients were under-represented among the complainants [7, 19] , contrary to a stereotypical idea found in the interviews with the surgeons in our study. That said, the national systems are not the same, and it should be pointed out that, in France, the 2002 law system has made it easy for patients to initiate a complaint free of charge, which, even if it will not often lead to the effective demonstration of a fault, remains the dark side of the profession and impacts the lives of most practitioners, like a \"sword of Damocles\" [12] .",

Is this negative pressure of a possible litigation really justified? In other words, are physicians the victims of \"irrational fears\" or are they, on the contrary, lucid observers of changes in patient behaviors? Several studies have highlighted this gap between \"real risk\" and \"perceived risk\" and the term \"litigaphobia\" has even been coined to define this concept [6] . It is nevertheless revealing to note that the path chosen by the French plaintiffs is a simple conciliation in only 15% of cases for spine surgery while it is in 50% of cases for all specialties combined [14] , which clearly shows that in the particular field of spinal surgery, the complaint process immediately takes a more threatening turn for the physician.",

In our interviews, there are no integral defensive behaviors as described in the USA for spine surgeons [11] , but there is a first draft, at least, on the selection of patients and on the avoidance of certain high-risk patients for major surgeries. It is interesting to note that some interviewees can transfer a patient to another facility (essentially public) not for technical incompetence but because the colleague will be better covered in case of complaints, a practice found in other countries and other health systems [34] .",

The underlying presence of this threat may alter the physician's career satisfaction and lead to serious psychological symptoms. Doctors who have received few or no complaints also report the same potential threat of litigation, which contributes to growing professional frustration [13] . This perceived risk is a significant stressor that can lead to compassion fatigue, directly correlated to reduced empathy toward patients. Clinical performance and the doctor-patient relationship are affected. Data suggested that accelerated burnout and depression re-occur in a vicious circle leading to worsening patient care and higher risk of adverse events [1] . Surgeons are often in an isolated position in the face of their chronic professional suffering: Even if recent steps, within institutions and via insurance companies, have been proposed to prevent and support practitioners in this kind of situation, there is still a long way to go in a profession marked by the culture of individualism and by a relationship of distrust with the administrations [23, 26] .",
