He walked into the emergency department independently, but within 1 hour needed an oxygen supply of 15 l/min on an OxyMask to maintain his oxygen saturation at 90%. A pulmonary CT scan showed extensive areas of ground-glass opacities and subtle consolidations bilaterally, predominantly in the basal lung areas, with some extension to all pulmonary lobes (CO-RADS 5). A SARS-Corona E-swab PCR test returned a positive result within a few hours. Laboratory testing showed increased levels of C-reactive protein (CRP; 153 \u00b5g/ml), ferritin (703 ng/ml) and D-dimer (3233 ng/ml). The diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia was made and treatment with chloroquine and prophylactic ceftriaxone and low-molecular weight heparin was initiated.",

On the second day of admission, the patient's respiratory condition further deteriorated and he had to be intubated for invasive ventilation in the prone position. As the extreme clinical deterioration in conjunction with laboratory findings (Fig. 1) raised a high suspicion of CRS, we decided to administer a single intravenous dose of TCZ at a dose of 8 mg/kg body-weight.
