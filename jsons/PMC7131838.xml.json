Mass-gathering events, such as the Olympics, highlight some of the concerns that can occur with sports and infectious diseases. International athletes compete together from countries with different endemic microorganisms and variable health care practices. For example, an outbreak of measles occurred in a Special Olympics event in St. Paul, Minnesota. The point of infection was suspected to be a track and field athlete from Argentina, resulting in measles infections in 16 individuals from 7 different states [3]. An outbreak of influenza that occurred during the 1988 Calgary Olympics was believed to have possibly affected the performances of some athletes [4]. The pneumococcal vaccine was recommended to athletes before competing in the 1992 Barcelona Olympics because of resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae strains endemic in Spain [5]. Medical reporting and surveillance of infections are extremely important to attempt to contain spread of disease. At the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, a priority of surveillance was to identify unusual presentations and infectious disease outbreaks to actively implement same-day medical and public health interventions [6].",

In a series of 256 students, 53 (21%) were found to be seronegative to measles alone, 13 (5%) were seronegative to rubella alone, and 5 (2%) were seronegative to measles and rubella. Eighty-six percent of the individuals seronegative to measles had previously received a dose of measles vaccine. Following a second injection, conversion to seropositive status rose to 97% and 100% for measles and rubella, respectively. These data support the need for a two-dose vaccine schedule [19].",

Rare adverse reactions from the vaccine include hypotonic, hyporesponsive episodes, high fever, seizures, and anaphylaxis [26]. Two acellular vaccines have been introduced that are as effective as whole-cell vaccines and have fewer adverse reactions [30]. These vaccines are combined with tetanus toxoid and reduced diphtheria toxoid (DTaP).

Diagnosis of pertussis infection is best performed through polymerase chain reaction assay (sensitivity, 94%; specificity, 97%) or through direct fluorescent antibody testing (sensitivity, 52%; specificity, 98%). Nasal swab cultures (sensitivity, 15%; specificity, 100%) are routinely performed; however, they have high false negative rates and take 7 to 12 days to yield results [33]. Physicians in the United States are legally required to report cases of pertussis to state public health departments [26]. It is estimated that 80% of susceptible household contacts will be infected after close contact [26]. Antibiotic prophylaxis is recommended for close contacts of persons who have pertussis to prevent outbreaks [34]. Preferred drugs are azithromycin for 5 days, clarithromycin for 7 days, or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole or erythromycin for 14 days, which are similar for prophylaxis and treatment [34].",

The influenza A virus, however, has become resistant to amantadine and rimantadine, which are presently not recommended to be used as first-line drugs [43]. Zanamivir (Ralenza, dry powder taken by orally inhaled route) and oseltamivir (Tamiflu, capsule or oral suspension) are neuraminidase inhibitors and can be used to treat patients and to control influenza outbreaks in closed settings. Although typically used in nursing homes, an outbreak in a dormitory may require chemoprophylaxis [9]. There are limited data to suggest that serious complications from influenza, such as lower respiratory tract infections, may be reduced [44]. The use of antiviral medications for prophylaxis of influenza is unclear and is not yet recommended for routine seasonal control [45]. The use of oseltamivir, however, has been recommended in specific cases, especially if there is high risk of spread such as household contacts and if individuals have not been immunized [46]. Oseltamivir was used to treat 36 of 188 patients, including 13 athletes during the 2002 Salt Lake City Winter Olympics, with medications given to close contacts, which was believed to limit the spread of influenza [47].",

The CDC Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommends routine vaccination of young adolescents (11\u201312 years old) with meningococcal vaccine (MCV4) at the preadolescent health care visit [50]. Therefore, sports medicine physicians may be faced with higher frequency of checking for meningococcal immunization status for high school and college athletes. A tetravalent conjugate vaccine (Menactra, Sanofi Pasteur) is available against Neisseria meningitidis isolates A, C, Y, and W-135 in a 0.5-mL single-dose vial. Over the age of 11 years, 75% of the meningococcal infections are caused by strains C, Y, or W-135 (CDC, unpublished data, 2004) [50]. Another vaccine, Menomune (Aventis Pasteur Limited), has been licensed since 1981 and has a similar immunogenicity profile to Menactra and is delivered subcutaneously as a 0.5-mL dose. Menactra and Menomune have serum bactericidal protection ranging from 89.4% and 94.4% for strain W-135 and 73.5% and 79.4% for strain Y, respectively [50]. Revaccination may be necessary for individuals at high risk after 5 years [52], [53]. Common side effects with MCV4 were local pain in just over 50% of patients, followed by swelling, induration, and redness in approximately 10.8% to 17.1%. Fever was reported in 5.1% of children 18 years old or younger and in 1.5% of adults [50].",

Widening woodland trails andkeeping in the center of the trail while walking may be helpful. When traveling in wooded areas, light-colored clothing is helpful to identify the tick. Long pants tucked into tightly woven socks and closed shoes minimize exposure. Deet at 10% to 25% should be applied to the skin. Permethrin may be applied only to the clothing. Clothes should be removed and cleaned and dried after exposure. The clothes dryer is effective in killing ticks. One should carefully check for ticks in the nymphal phase that may be the size of a pin head. Careful inspection should be done of the hair, ears, axilla, belly button, and legs. Children and pets should also be checked. It is also important to monitor pets that may travel in the woods and return indoors.",

Bleach diluted with tap water in a 1:10 ratio can be used to wash equipment that has had contact with blood or body fluid.

Although contact sports such as wrestling and football have been commonly associated with MRSA spread, this infection has also been discovered in minimal-contact sports such as fencing [78]. Three factors are associated with MRSA spread in sports. First, even with sports that have minimal contact, there are often abrasions and chaffing from clothing and hot environments. Second, equipment is often shared and there is potential for transmission of bacteria. Third, many sports have sufficient skin-to-skin contact to transmit organisms. Subsequently, health care providers should strongly encourage good overall and hand hygiene in addition to covering all wounds and limiting shared equipment. It is crucial to have an ample supply of soap and water and alcohol-based hand cleansers. Athletes, staff, and coaches should be educated in proper first aid for wounds, in recognition of wounds that are potentially infected, and in seeking medical attention for lesions that have concerning signs, especially large pustules or boils.",

Jock itch, tinea cruris, is best prevented by showering immediately after athletic endeavors and wearing cotton briefs. A good talc powder may be used for prevention of athlete's foot and jock itch.

The male condom can also reduce the transmission of gonorrhea, chlamydiosis, and trichomiasis [81]. There may be some added protection against herpes simplex virus 2 and a 70% reduction of HPV transmission [82], [83]. When an individual is allergic to latex, certain polyurethane condoms are likely just as effective, although they may break more readily. Conversely, natural-membrane condoms such as lambskin are too porous to be used for STD prevention. Only water-based lubricants should be used with latex condoms because oil bases will weaken the latex. The female condom is a double-ringed polyurethane sheath that is used vaginally and during anal receptive intercourse that is effective in limited trials in preventing HIV/STDs [84], [85]. Spermicides and nonbarrier contraception have no role in STD prevention.",
