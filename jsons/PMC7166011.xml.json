Cases were diagnosed and disease severity was graded by treating pulmonologists based on the latest diagnostic criteria.2 Control participants were selected randomly within each ophthalmology department where case(s) were identified using 3 to 4 control participants per case. All participants were ophthalmologists, ophthalmic nurses, or technicians who worked in an ophthalmology department and had been involved in patient care since the outbreak. The questionnaire, distributed to the participants through a link built into the WeChat program (Tencent Technology Co. Ltd, Shenzhen, China), included demographic information and information on personal protective equipment (PPE) and hand hygiene. After informed consent was obtained, all questionnaires were answered by the participants themselves with the exception of 2 participants: one who died and another who remained intubated through data collection. The study was conducted in accordance with the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the institutional review board of Central Theater Command General Hospital.",

Second, although control participants showed negative RT-PCR results, SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests were not performed; as such, we cannot rule out the possibility of asymptomatic COVID-19 among control participants.
