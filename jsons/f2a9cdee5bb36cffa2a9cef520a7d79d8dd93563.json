It not only provides better understanding of the pathogenesis of the disease but also of the rational design of infectious-control strategies. Hospital-acquired infections still account for many hospitalizations and deaths around the world, with many of these infections being transmitted via aerosolized microorganisms to patients and healthcare workers (HCWs).",

These \"droplet nuclei\" are involved in the long-range transmission route but can also cause infection in the short range. Once infectious droplets are released, the main factors that determine how they are transported are their size, type (with or without structural lipids), airfl ow patterns, humidity, and temperature. Humidity alters the evaporation rate of the droplets and therefore affects droplets' size. Knight estimated the time taken for particles to fall to the fl oor in a 3-m height room. Particles of 1-3 \u03bcm in diameter remain suspended almost indefi nitely, 10-\u03bcm droplets stay in the air 17 min, 20-\u03bcm droplets remain for 4 min, and 100-\u03bcm droplets fall to the ground after 10 s [ 2 ] . The droplet size thus affects how airfl ow patterns distribute their deposition. Temperature changes also greatly infl uence the exchange fl ows between rooms. Both temperature and humidity affect the lipid envelope and protein coat, affecting the period of survival. Temperatures above about 24 \u00b0C appear universally to decrease airborne bacterial survival. Transport of such airborne droplets is driven by various other environmental factors, such as the local ventilation airfl ow (windows, doors, ventilation systems), the movement of people and their clothing, and thermal and airfl ow gradients produced by various pieces of equipment.",

            "text": "Another important consideration for the pathogenesis of aerosolized transmitted infectious diseases is the penetration and deposition of these infected particles in the respiratory tract. Particles >20 \u03bcm rarely penetrate below the trachea, particles 5-10 \u03bcm have 50 % penetration of the tracheobronchial tree, and particles <5 \u03bcm have less penetration of the alveolar region (30 %) [ 3 ] . Receptors are required for some infectious agents to initiate successful infection and eventually disease. Whereas bacteria and fungi can exist independently of host cells, viruses require specifi c receptors to which they can bind before entering and replicating within particular host cells. This requirement has been offered as one of the explanations for why certain individuals were infected with avian infl uenza A (H5N1) and perhaps why others were not. Differing receptor distribution patterns in the upper and lower respiratory tracts among individuals can affect the ease with which inhaled airborne viruses can cause infection and disease [ 4 , 5 ] . Finally, the nature of the infecting agent and the human respiratory activity itself may cause a different variety of organism to be expelled with differing effects on secondary cases. The physiology of a cough suggests that it is more likely to bring up and expel deep-seated organisms from the lower respiratory tract (e.g., infl uenza, Staphylococcus and Streptococcus bacterial species)than the sneeze or normal speech, both of which are more likely to expel organisms inhabiting the upper respiratory tract(e.g., rhinoviruses and coronaviruses).",

The infectious dose varies among individual pathogens and their hosts. Not only are immunocompromised hosts more susceptible to infection, even with low infectious doses they become more effective source spreaders because the pathogen is poorly controlled, leading to super-spreading events.

The risk of infectious transmission is unclear, however, because of scarce scientifi c evidence to demonstrate the creation of aerosolassociated infections with these procedures, the burden of potential viable microbes within the created aerosols, and the mechanism of transmission to the host. Several simulation studies with different AGPs have been published that tried to compensate for the lack of knowledge concerning airborne transmission with these procedures. Hui et al. studied aerosol particle production from various AGPsoxygen mask, jet nebulizer, and noninvasive ventilation (NIV)-using a human patient simulator (HPS)and measurement of smoke particles. The aerosol particles exhaled using oxygen masks with fl ow at 4 L and 12 breaths per minute were captured by digital images showing that the exhaled air reached peak distances of 0.40 m [ 12 ] . The maximum dispersion distance of smoke particles through the nebulizer side vent was 0.45 m lateral to the HPS at normal lung condition but increased to 0.54 m in the presence of mild lung injury and beyond 0.8 m in the presence of severe lung injury [ 13 ] . Exhaled dispersion was also studied during NIV in the HPS simulating mild lung injury in an isolation room with negative pressure using different masks and increasing inspiratory positive airway pressure (IPAP) (10-18 cmH 2 O) and stable expiratory positive airway pressure (EPAP) (4 cmH 2 O). Using a ResMed Ultra Mirage mask, the dispersion was 0.40 m at an IPAP of 10 cmH 2 O and only increased to 0.45 m with an IPAP of 18cmH 2 O [ 14 ] . The distance dispersion using the Respironics Image 3 mask, which requires an additional exhalation device to avoid CO 2 retention, was 0.65 m with 10 cmH 2 O of IPAP and increased to beyond 0.95 m with an IPAP of 18cmH 2 O. With the Respironics Comfort Full 2 mask, the distance was 0.65 m with IPAP at10-14 cmH 2 O and increased to 0.85 m with IPAP at 18 cmH 2 O [ 15 ] . These studies used human simulator models or normal subjects mimicking respiratory distress, but the HPS may not closely refl ect the behavior of sick patients. Also, the smoke particles measured were considerably smaller (<1 \u03bcm) than droplets generated by coughing and sneezing (5 to >10 \u03bcm). Therefore, the behavior of smoke particles may not accurately represent droplet dispersion.",

[ 16 ] evaluated the characteristics of droplet/aerosol dispersion around delivery systems during NIV, 60 % O 2 , nebulizer treatment, and chest physiotherapy by measuring the droplet sizes at <20 cm from the face or mask and at 1 m distance. They also assessed the decay of droplets over time after discontinuing an intervention and the impact of modifying the NIV circuit by inserting a viral/bacterial fi lter in clinical practice. Three groups were studied: normal control subjects ( n = 12); subjects with coryzal symptoms ( n = 11); adult patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) admitted because of an infective exacerbation ( n = 21). NIV using a vented mask without the fi ltered circuit and chest physiotherapy are droplet-, not aerosol-, generating procedures. They created droplets >10 \u03bcm in the COPD ( p = 0.042) and coryzal ( p = 0.044) patients but not in normal controls. Because of their large mass, most of the droplets landed on local surfaces within 1 m. O 2 did not increase droplet count in any size range. The only device that produced an aerosol was the nebulizer, consistent with nebulizer characteristics. (Nebulizers do not disseminate large droplets from patients.) These fi ndings suggest that HCWs providing NIV and chest physiotherapy working within 1 m of an infected patient should have a high level of respiratory protection. Control measures designed to limit aerosol spread, such as negative-pressure rooms, may have less relevance.",
