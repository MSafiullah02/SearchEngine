Both ligand- and structure-based approaches are increasingly being used for the design of small lead and druglike molecules with anticipated multitarget activities [1]. Various ligand-based methods have been developed for effective and comprehensive application in virtual screening (VS), de novo design, and lead optimization. Pharmacophore has become one of the major ligand-based tools in computational chemistry for the drug research and development process [2]. Again, molecular recognitions, including enzyme\u2013substrate, drug\u2013protein, drug\u2013nucleic acid, protein\u2013nucleic acid, and protein\u2013protein interactions, play significant roles in many biological responses. As a consequence, identification of the binding mode and affinity of the drug molecule is crucial to understanding the underlying mechanism of action in the respective therapeutic response. In this perspective, structure-based drug design is always a front-runner among all the available drug design approaches. Molecular docking is one of the largely acclaimed structure-based approaches, widely used for the study of molecular recognition, which aims to predict the binding mode and binding affinity of a complex formed by two or more constituent molecules with known structures [3].\n",

The VS approach is used for computationally prioritizing drug candidate molecules for future synthesis by using certain filters. The filters may be created by employing knowledge about the protein target (in structure-based VS) or known bioactive ligands (in ligand-based VS). These computational methods are powerful tools, as they supply a straightforward way to estimate the properties of the molecules and establish them as probable drug candidates from a huge number of compounds in no time in a cost-effective way. A combination of bioinformatics and chemoinformatics is crucial to the success of VS of chemical libraries, which is an alternative and complementary approach to high-throughput screening (HTS) in the lead discovery process [7].

This definition discards a misuse often found in the medicinal chemistry literature, which consists of naming as pharmacophores simple chemical functionalities such as guanidines, sulfonamides, or dihydroimidazoles (formerly imidazolines), or typical structural skeletons such as flavones, phenothiazines, prostaglandins, or steroids.A pharmacophore is defined by pharmacophoric descriptors, including H-bonding, hydrophobic, and electrostatic interaction sites, defined by atoms, ring centers, and virtual points.\n",

The types of ligand molecules and the size and diversity of the data set have a great impact on the resulting pharmacophore model. Although a pharmacophore model signifies the key interactions between a ligand and its biological target, neither the structure of the target nor its identity is required to construct a handy pharmacophore model. As a consequence, pharmacophore approaches are often considered to be vital when the accessible information is very restricted. For example, when one knows nothing more than the structures of active ligands, a pharmacophore is the answer.",

This conformational search can be divided into four categories: (i) systematic search in the torsional space, (ii) clustering (if wanted or needed), (iii) stochastic methods, such as Monte Carlo (MC), sampling, and Poling, and (iv) molecular dynamics [15]. Commonly employed conformational search methods are BEST, FAST, and conformer algorithms based on energy screening and recursive buildup (CAESAR) [16], all of which generate conformations that provide broad coverage of the accessible conformational space. The FAST conformation generation method searches conformations only in the torsion space and takes less time. The BEST method provides a complete and improved coverage of conformational space by performing a rigorous energy minimization and optimizing the conformations in both torsional and Cartesian space using the Poling algorithm. CAESAR is based on a divide-and-conquer and recursive conformation approach. This approach is also combined in cases of local rotational symmetry so that conformation duplicates due to topological symmetry in a systematic search can be efficiently eliminated.",

Predictive 3D pharmacophores are generated in three phases: a constructive, a subtractive, and an optimization phase, as follows:\nConstructive phase: HipHop is intended to derive common feature hypothesis-based pharmacophore models using information from a set of active compounds. HipHop does not require the selection of a template; rather, each molecule is treated as a template in turn. Different configurations of chemical features are identified in the template molecule using a pruned exhaustive search, which starts with small sets of features and then extends until no larger configuration is found. Next, each configuration is compared with the remaining molecules to identify configurations that are common to all molecules. The resulting pharmacophores are ranked using a combination of how well the molecules in the training set map onto the pharmacophore model. In HipHop, the user can define how many molecules must map completely or partially to a pharmacophore configuration. Again, HypoGen [18] is an algorithm that uses the activity values of the small compounds in the training set to generate hypotheses to build 3D pharmacophore models. HypoGen identifies all allowable pharmacophores consisting of up to five features among the two most active compounds and investigates the remaining active compounds in the list.\nSubtractive phase: This phase deals with pharmacophores that were created in the constructive phase and removes pharmacophores from the data structure that are not likely to be useful.\n\nOptimization phase: The optimization phase is performed using the simulated annealing algorithm. A maximum of 10 hypotheses are generated for each run. HypoGen develops models with different pharmacophore features: (i) hydrogen-bond acceptor (HBA); (ii) hydrogen-bond donor (HBD); (iii) hydrophobic (HYD), HYDROPHOBIC (aliphatic) and HYDROPHOBIC (aromatic); (iv) negative charge (NEG CHARGE); (v) negative ionizable (NI); (vi) positive charge (POS CHARGE); (vii) positive ionizable (PI); and (viii) ring aromatic (RA).

            "text": "The HypoGen module performs a fixed cost calculation that represents the simple model that fits all the data, and a null cost calculation that assumes that there is no relationship in the data set and that the experimental activities are normally distributed about their average value. A small range of the total hypothesis cost obtained for each of the hypotheses indicates homogeneity of the corresponding hypothesis, and the training set selected for the purpose of pharmacophore generation is adequate. Again, values of total cost close to those of fixed cost indicate the fact that the hypotheses generated are statistically robust [19], [20]. The total cost of a hypothesis is calculated as per Eq. (10.1):(10.1)Cost=eE+wW+cCwhere e, w, and c are the coefficients associated with the error (E), weight (W), and configuration (C) components, respectively. The other two important costs involved are the fixed cost and null cost. The fixed cost represents the simplest model that perfectly fits the data and is calculated by Eq. (10.2):(10.2)Fixedcost=eE(x=0)+wW(x=0)+cCwhere x is the deviation from the expected values of weight and error. The null cost is the cost of a pharmacophore when the activity data of every molecule in the training set is the average value of all activities in the set and the pharmacophore has no features. Therefore, the contribution from the weight or configuration component does not apply. The null cost is calculated as per Eq. (10.3):(10.3)Nullcost=eE(\u03c7est=\u03c7\u00af)where \u03c7est is the averaged scaled activity of the training set molecules. It has been suggested that the differences between cost of the generated hypothesis and the null hypothesis should be as large as possible; a value of 40\u201360 bits difference may indicate that it has a 75\u201390% chance of representing a true correlation in the data set used. The total cost of any hypothesis should be toward the value of fixed cost to represent any meaningful model. Two other very important output parameters are the configuration cost and the error cost. Any value of configuration cost higher than 17 may indicate that the correlation from any generated pharmacophore is most likely due to chance. The error cost increases as the value of the root mean square (RMS) increases. The RMS deviations (RMSDs) represent the quality of the correlation between the estimated and the actual activity data.",

This is done by scrambling the activity data of the training set molecules and assigning them new values, followed by the generation of pharmacophore hypotheses using the same features and parameters as those used to develop the original pharmacophore hypothesis. The original hypothesis is considered to be generated by mere chance if the randomized data set results in the generation of a pharmacophore with better or nearly equal correlation compared to the original one.\nTest set prediction: The purpose of the pharmacophore hypothesis generation is not only to predict the activity of the training set compounds [21], but also to predict the activities of external molecules. With the objective of verifying whether the pharmacophore is able to predict the activity of test set molecules in agreement with the experimentally determined value, the activities of the test set molecules are estimated based on the mapping of the test set molecules to the developed pharmacophore model. The conformers are generated for the test set molecules based on the method that is used during the conformer generation of the training set, and they are mapped using the corresponding pharmacophore models. Thus, the predictive capacity of the models is judged based on the predictive R\n2 values (Rpred2 with a threshold value of 0.5) or classification-based methods (such as sensitivity, specificity, precision, and accuracy). The test set should cover similar structural diversity as the training set in order to establish the broadness of the pharmacophore predictability.\nGH scoring: The GH scoring method is employed following test set validation to evaluate the quality of the pharmacophore models [22], [23], [24]. The GH score can be successfully applied to quantify model selectivity precision of hits and the recall of actives from a directory of useful decoys (DUD) data set [25] consisting of known actives and inactives. The DUD is a publicly available database for free use, generated based on the observation that physical characteristics of the decoy background can be used for the classification of different compounds. The DUD can be downloaded from http://dud.docking.org.\n",

The LBP is usually carried out by extracting common chemical features from the 3D structures of a known set of ligands representative of fundamental interactions between the ligands and a specific macromolecular target. In the case of LBP modeling, pharmacophore generation from multiple ligands involves two major steps: First, creation of the conformational space for each ligand in the training set to represent conformational flexibility of the ligands and to align the multiple ligands in the training set, and second, determination of the essential common chemical features to build the pharmacophore model. The conformational analysis of ligands and performing molecular alignment are the key techniques as well as the main complexities in any LBP modeling.",

            "text": "A few challenges still exist in spite of the great advances of LBP modeling:a.The first problem, and one of the most serious, is the modeling of ligand flexibility. Presently, two strategies are utilized to deal with this problem. The first is the preenumerating method, in which multiple conformations for each ligand are precomputed and saved in a database [28]. The advantage of this approach is lower computing cost for conducting molecular alignment at the expense of a possible need for a mass storage capacity. The second approach is the on-the-fly method, in which the conformation analysis is carried out in the pharmacophore modeling process [28]. This approach does not need mass storage but might need higher central processing unit (CPU) time for conducting meticulous optimization. It has been demonstrated that the preenumerating method outperforms the on-the-fly calculation approach [29]. Recently, a considerable number of advanced algorithms [14] have been established to sample the conformational spaces of small molecules, which are listed in Table 10.1\n.Most importantly, a good conformation generator should ensure the following conditions: (i) proficiently generating all the putative bound conformations that small molecules adopt when they interact with macromolecules, (ii) keeping the list of low-energy conformations as short as possible to avoid the combinational explosion problem, and (iii) being less time consuming for the conformational calculations.b.Molecular alignment is the second issue of concern in LBP modeling. The alignment methods can be classified into two approaches in terms of their elementary nature: point-based and property-based [29]. The points of the point-based method can be further discriminated as atoms, fragments, or chemical features [30]. In the point-based algorithms, pairs of atoms, fragments, or chemical feature points are usually superimposed employing a least-squares fitting. The major disadvantage of this approach is the requirement for predefined anchor points because the generation of these points can become problematic in the case of different ligands. Consequently, the property-based algorithms utilize molecular field descriptors, generally represented by sets of Gaussian functions, to generate alignments. Recently, new alignment methods have been developed, including stochastic proximity embedding [31], atomic property fields [32], fuzzy pattern recognition [33], and grid-based interaction energies [34].c.The third challenge lies in the appropriate selection of training set compounds. Although this problem is simple and nontechnical, but it often puzzles researchers nonetheless. The type of ligand molecules, the size of the data set, and its chemical diversity largely affect considerably the final generated pharmacophore model [28].\n",

As a consequence, it cannot be applied to cases when no ligands targeting the binding site of interest are known. This can be solved by the macromolecule-based approach.

A pharmacophore model consisting of too many chemical features (e.g., more than seven) is not appropriate for practical applications (e.g., 3D database screening). Therefore, it is always important to pick a restricted number of chemical features (usually three to seven) to create a reliable pharmacophore hypothesis. One more significant drawback is that the obtained pharmacophore hypothesis cannot replicate the quantitative structure\u2013activity relationship (QSAR) because the model is generated based just on a single macromolecule\u2013ligand complex or a single macromolecule.\n",

Many factors like the quality and composition of the pharmacophore model and the macromolecular target information can contribute to this problem. The most probable factors are as follows:a.The most critical one is the development of a robust and reliable pharmacophore hypothesis. Addressing this issue requires an inclusive validation and optimization of the pharmacophore model.b.Different molecules can be retrieved in VS from different hypotheses of a single pharmacophore model, which is probably an important reason for the higher false-positive/false-negative rates in some studies.c.The flexibility of target macromolecule in pharmacophore approaches is handled by introducing a tolerance radius for each pharmacophoric feature, which is unlikely to entirely account for macromolecular flexibility in some cases. Recent attempts [46] to integrate molecular dynamics simulation (MDS) into pharmacophore modeling have recommended that the pharmacophore models generated from MDS trajectories explain the considerably enhanced representation of the flexibility of pharmacophores.d.The steric restriction by the macromolecular target which is not adequately considered in pharmacophore models, although it is partially accounted for by the consideration of excluded volumes. In most of the cases, interactions between a ligand and a protein are distance-sensitive, particularly the short-range interactions, such as the electrostatic interaction, which a pharmacophore model is tricky to account for.

The most commonly used terms connected with docking studies are defined next. All the discussed terms are graphically represented in Figure 10.6\n:\nReceptor: A receptor is a protein molecule or a polymeric structure in or on a cell that distinctively recognizes and binds a molecule (ligand) acting as a molecular messenger. When such ligands bind to a receptor, they cause some kind of cellular response.\nLigand: A ligand is the complementary partner molecule that binds to the receptor for effective bimolecular response. Ligands are most often small drug molecules, neurotransmitters, hormones, lymphokines, lectins, and antigens, but they could also be another biopolymer or macromolecule (in the case of protein\u2013protein docking).\nDocking: Docking is a molecular modeling technique designed to find the proper fit between a ligand and its binding site (receptor).\nDock pose: A ligand molecule can bind with a receptor in a multiple positions, conformations, and orientations. Each such docking mode is called a dock pose.\n\nBinding mode: Binding mode is the orientation of the ligand relative to the receptor, as well as the conformation of the ligand and receptor when they are bound to each other.\nDock score: The process of evaluating a particular pose by counting the number of favorable intermolecular interactions such as hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic contacts. In order to recognize the energetically most favorable pose, each pose is evaluated based on its compatibility to the target in terms of shape and properties such as electrostatics and generate corresponding dock score. A good dock score for a given ligand signifies that it is potentially a good binder.\nRanking: Ranking is the process of classifying which ligands are most likely to interact favorably to a particular receptor based on the predicted free energy of binding. After completion of docking, all ligands are consequently ranked by their respective dock scores (i.e., their predicted affinities). This rank-ordered list is then employed for further synthesis and biological investigation only for those compounds that are predicted to be most active.\nPose prediction: Pose prediction can be defined as searching for the accurate binding mode of a ligand, which is typically carried out by performing a number of trials and keeping those poses that are energetically best. It involves finding the correct orientation and the correct conformation of the docked ligand due to their flexible nature.\nScoring or affinity prediction: Affinity prediction or scoring functions are applied to the energetically best pose or n number of best poses found for each ligand, and comparing the affinity scores for different ligands give their relative rank ordering. [52].Scoring functions are generally divided into two main groups. One main group comprises knowledge-based scoring functions that are derived using statistics for the observed interatomic contact frequencies, distances, or both in a large database of crystal structures of protein\u2013ligand complexes. The other group contains scoring schemes based on physical interaction terms [53]. These so-called energy component methods are based on the assumption that the change in free energy upon binding of a ligand to its target can be decomposed into a sum of individual contributions:\n(10.8)\u0394Gbind=\u0394Gint+\u0394Gsolv+\u0394Gconf+\u0394GmotionThe terms defined for the main energetic contributions to the binding event are as follows: specific ligand\u2013receptor interactions (\u0394G\nint), the interactions of ligand and receptor with solvent (\u0394G\nsolv), the conformational changes in the ligand and the receptor (\u0394G\nconf), and the motions in the protein and the ligand during the complex formation (\u0394G\nmotion).\n",

The quality of the receptor structure plays a crucial role in the success of docking studies. In general, the higher the resolution (preferably <2 \u00c5) of the employed crystal structure, the better the observed docking results are. Another important criterion for examining the quality of a receptor structure is Debye\u2013Waller factor (DWF), or B-factor; or the temperature factor, which is used to describe the attenuation of X-ray scattering or coherent neutron scattering caused by thermal motion. It signifies the relative vibrational motion of different parts of the protein. Atoms with low B-factors belong to a part of the structure that is well ordered, and atoms with large B-factors generally belong to part of the structure that is very flexible. As a consequence, it is important to ensure that the B-factors of the atoms in the binding site region are logical, as high values imply that their coordinates are less reliable. Identification of the bound-ligand in the cocrystal structure and the knowledge about its interaction with the corresponding protein\u2019s amino acid residues are very important before starting a docking study.2.\nReceptor homology modeling and threading techniques: On the contrary, if the X-ray crystal structure of the protein is not available, one can opt for the protein structure prediction techniques. In that case, most commonly applied techniques are \u201cthreading\u201d and \u201chomology modeling\u201d [54], [55]. In the case of threading or the fold recognition technique, an estimation is made whether a given amino acid sequence is compatible with one of the ligands in a database. On the other hand, homology or comparative modeling relies on a correlation or homology between the sequence of the target protein and at least one known structure. Correct homology models can be generated, provided that the sequence identity of a given target sequence is >50% to a known structure template. Modest homology model building efforts could potentially create receptor structures for entire target families. Importantly, homology modeling is a comparatively economical method for generating a diversity of receptor conformations using either single-template or multiple-template structures enhancing the understanding of selectivity.3.\nA set of ligands of interest: Once the 3D structure of the protein of interest has been attained from either experiments (X-ray crystal structure) or predictions (receptor from homology modeling), the docking study can be performed using ligands of interest employing a multiplicity of docking techniques. If the function of the protein is unknown, it may be vital to search its structure for hypothetical binding sites. These binding sites can be explored for the binding of selected ligands or they can be compared with known binding sites. An analysis of the binding site characteristics and the interactions with a given ligand can lead to important insights for the design of novel ligands or the docking of assumed ligand molecules [56].\n",

In spite of its sampling totality for ligand conformations, the number of the choices can be huge due to an increase in the number of rotatable bonds. As a consequence, to make the docking process realistic, geometric and chemical constraints are normally applied to the initial screening of ligand poses, and the filtered ligand conformations are further subject to the more precise refinement and optimization measures.b.\nFragmentation approach: The basic idea behind this approach is that the ligand is first divided into a number of fragments. Then, the ligand-binding conformation is grown by placing one fragment at a time in the binding site or by docking all the fragments into the binding site and linking them covalently.c.\nConformational ensemble: In the conformational ensemble methods [69], ligand flexibility is achieved by rigidly docking an ensemble of pregenerated ligand conformations with other programs (e.g., OMEGA).

The protein should be adjusted by fixing any serious errors like incomplete residues near the active site. The charges and atom types for any metal atoms should be set properly, if needed. If there are bonds to metal ions, the bonds should be deleted, followed by adjusting the formal charges of the atoms that were attached to the metal, as well as the metal itself. The protein molecule, thus prepared, is the total receptor ready for docking.c.\nLigand\u2013protein docking: After ensuring that protein and ligands are in the correct form for docking, in a few cases the receptor grid files are generated using a grid\u2013receptor generation program for grid-based docking. The grid box is generally generated at the centroid of the ligand bound to the active site of the receptor. In other cases, active pockets of the protein are identified to dock the prepared ligand in those identified pockets. Initially, all the molecules of the data set should be docked into the active site of the protein and the interaction energies between each ligand and the receptor can be calculated. The obtained results are then needed to be compared with those of the bound ligand of the crystallized protein structure in order to assess whether the molecules fit into the specified active site of the receptor or not. A set number of ligand poses should be saved for each conformation of the ligand. A predefined number of docking poses thus saved for each conformation of the compound can be ranked according to their dock score function, and then their interaction with the receptor can be analyzed. From the docking studies, the receptor\u2013ligand interactions are correlated with the biological activity of the data set compounds. The structural validation of the docking procedure is done by extracting the cocrystallized ligand from the active site of the receptor and redocking it to the receptor to ensure that it binds to the same active site and interacts with the same amino acid residues as before. The basic steps are schematically illustrated in Figure 10.9\n.\n",

            "text": "A significant amount of work has been performed to devise superior docking programs and scoring functions over the past years. However, there is still room for improvement. This section presents some of the primary challenges and the required improvements that will advance the performance of docking and scoring [79].\nChallenges:a.\nWater molecules in protein: Water molecules often play a significant role in protein\u2013ligand interaction. If water-mediated interactions during docking is ignored, the estimated interaction energy of a given ligand conformation may be too low. On the contrary, if one holds water molecules present in the crystal protein structure, then the binding pose and affinity of a ligand will not be reliable. Thus, it is very difficult to treat the water molecules effectively. To perform reliable and acceptable docking, one first need to recognize probable positions for water molecules where they could interact with the protein and ligand, and subsequently, one must be capable to predict whether a water molecule is indeed present at that position.b.\nTautomers and protomers: Another significant challenge with docking is consideration for the various tautomeric and protomeric states that the molecules can adopt. Most of the time, molecules such as acids or amines are stored in their neutral forms. As they are ionized under physiological conditions, it is essential to ionize them prior to docking. Although ionization is easy to attain, but the problem of tautomer generation is already much more difficult, as other questions will arise, such as: Which tautomer should one use? Should one use more than one or all possible tautomers for a given molecule? Not only tautomers, but also different ionization states of ligands provide real challenges in docking.\nc.\nDocking into flexible receptors: One of the most challenging problems in docking is dealing with flexible receptors. Numerous examples have become known where the same protein adopts different conformations depending on which ligand it binds to [80]. In order to deal with the trouble of flexible receptors in docking, several approaches have been proposed: (1) letting the receptor or parts of it move during docking; (2) docking the compounds into numerous different conformations of the same receptor and aggregating the results; and (3) docking into averaged receptor representations. In a few cases, more than one of these methods are used based on the requirements in question.\n\nRequired improvements:d.\nMultiple active-site corrections (MASC): A possible way of improving docking results is the application of MASC, a simple statistical correction [81]. The scoring functions prefer certain ligand types or characteristics, such as large or hydrophobic ligands. As a consequence, some ligands are predicted to be good binders regardless of whether these ligands will bind to specific active sites. Therefore, MASC has been introduced, which can be interpreted either as a statistical measure of ligand specificity or as a correction for ligand-related bias in the scoring function. In order to calculate the MASC scores, each ligand is docked into a number of unrelated binding sites of different binding site characteristics. The corrected score (or MASC score) S\u2032ij for ligand molecule i in binding site j is calculated as follows:(10.9)S\u2032ij=(Sij\u2212\u03bci)\u03c3iwhere S\nij is the uncorrected score for the ligand, and \u03bc\ni and \u03c3\ni represent the mean and standard deviation of the scores for the ligand molecule i across the different binding sites. Thus, the MASC score S\u2032ij represents a measure of specificity of molecule i for binding site j compared to the other binding sites.e.\nDocking with constraints: By introducing a constraint during docking, it is feasible to control the way the poses are generated and the ones that are preferentially set aside. For example, in the case of the DockIt program [82], one can apply distance constraints between the ligand and protein that are consequently utilized during pose generation via a distance geometry approach.f.\nPostprocessing: There are two approaches of postprocessing that can be employed in the case of a docking study: (i) applying postdock filters and (ii) using tailor-made rescoring functions. The postdock filters are theoretically simple and may correspond to certain geometric criteria, like the existence of certain interactions (e.g., a hydrogen bond with a selected residue or a polar interaction) or the filling of a specified pocket in the active site. Again, all scoring functions may exhibit biased behavior with certain compound classes or functional groups. To diminish the impact of this difficulty and to decrease the statistical noise, composite scoring, or rescoring methods have been introduced [83]. Rather than using a single scoring function, several scoring functions are merged such that in order to be classified as a potential binder, a molecule has to be scored well by a number of different scoring functions. Another way of postprocessing is to use the docking results as input to develop a Bayesian model with the aim of reducing the numbers of false positives and false negatives [84].\n\n",

This technique is based upon the hypothesis that the free energy of binding can be correlated with a subset of energy components calculated from the structures of receptors and ligands in bound and unbound forms [4], [85]. Computation of binding free energies is very challenging due to the need to sample conformational space effectively in order to compute entropic contributions. Empirical scoring functions, which are fast to calculate, have been derived to approximate binding free energy using a single structure of a receptor\u2013ligand complex [86]. If some experimental binding data are accessible for a set of related complexes, then this information can be used to derive a target-specific scoring function. This algorithm is taken in the COMBINE analysis in which the binding free energy (\u0394G) or inhibition constant (K\ni) or other related properties are correlated with a subset of weighted interaction energy components determined from the structures of energy minimized receptor\u2013ligand complexes. The receptor binding free energy (\u0394G) of a ligand can be expressed as(10.10)\u0394G=\u2211i=1n\u03c9i\u0394uirep+C\n",

Due to the large number of variables and their intercorrelation nature, partial least squares (PLS) is the technique of choice for deriving the QSAR model that can quantify the most important energy interactions in terms of activity prediction [87], [88].\n",

First, to execute COMBINE analysis, each of the ligands against a particular target has to be docked into its target. It requires a training set of docked and optimized ligand\u2013receptor complexes, and the unbound ligands and receptor for which intermolecular and intramolecular interaction energies are calculated. The calculated descriptors are then correlated with the experimental activity of the studied compounds to develop a QSAR model. Finally, the interpretation of the developed mathematical equation can enlighten the important ligand\u2013receptor interactions for future drug designing and development process.\ngCOMBINE: gCOMBINE is an user-friendly tool for performing COMBINE analysis in drug design research programs. It is a graphical user interface (GUI) written in Java with the purpose of performing COMBINE analysis on a set of ligand\u2013receptor complexes with the intention of deriving highly informative QSAR models [93]. The objective of this method is to generate the ligand\u2013receptor interaction energies into a series of variables, explore the origins of the variance within the set employing principal component analysis (PCA), and then allocate weights to the chosen ligand\u2013residue interactions by using PLS analysis to correlate with the experimental activities or binding affinities. The major advantages of using a GUI are that it allows plenty of interactivity and provides multiple plots representing the energy descriptors entering the analysis, scores, loadings, experimental versus predicted regression lines, and the evolution of classical validation parameters. Using the GUI, one can carry out numerous added tasks, such as possible truncation of positive interaction energy values and generation of ready-made PDB files containing information related to the importance of the activity of individual protein residues. This information can be aptly displayed and color-coded using a molecular graphics program like PyMOL.\n",

The filter demonstrates that poor absorption or permeation are more likely to occur when (i) molecular weight (MW) is over 500, (ii) calculated octanol/water partition coefficient (logP) is over 5, (iii) presence of more than 5 HBDs, and (iv) presence of more than 10 HBAs [101].

The ligand-based approach is possible without protein information and can be employed for scaffold hopping. Again, since this technique is biased by the properties of known ligands, it limits the diversity of the hits generated.b.\nReceptor-based approach: The approach uses techniques like protein\u2013ligand docking, different scoring functions, and active-site-directed SBPs for the molecular recognition between a ligand and a target protein to select chemical entities that bind to the active sites of biologically relevant targets with known 3D structures. The major advantages of this approach are the following: It is possible to carry out this process without ligand information, the entire capability of the protein pocket is taken into account, prediction of binding modes is possible, scaffold hopping and profiling without any bias toward existing ligands can be done.c.\nCombination of ligand- and receptor-based approach: As there is no universal method for the VS, one can use ligand- and structure-based methods separately (e.g., pharmacophore and docking one by one as a two-layer technique), or can employ the combined ligand- and structure-based methods like COMBINE and CoRIA. The COMBINE and CoRIA approaches are reliable. as they consider the ligand and receptor information as well as information regarding their binding complexes.d.\nMachine learning techniques: Apart from the ligand- and receptor-based approaches, machine learning techniques like support vector machine (SVM) and binary kernel discrimination (BKD) can be tactfully applied in a few cases of VS. The SVM predicts the bioactivity by representing the lead in n-dimensional real space using molecular descriptors and fingerprint technology, where n represents the number of features or attributes. The SVM approach is based on the fuzzy logic fingerprint. The BKD is a recently developed computational approach. In BKD, the molecule is represented as 2D fragment bit-string. It consists of three components. First, the structural representation section; second, the similarity searching section using different coefficients; and third, the section with different weighting schemes for lead compounds.\n",

            "text": "While applying the VS technique, the researcher must face many difficulties, such as finding the best possible balance between efficiency and precision when evaluating a particular algorithm, determining which method achieves better results and in what situations, and defining whether there is any universal method or workflow for VS. Considering the altitude of settings, parameters, and data sets, researchers have to explore a large number of ifs and buts during execution of VS. There are many known limitations (as well as still-unreported ones) of VS techniques. The probable pitfalls are discussed in the following section, along with possible ways to resolve them [109]. The pitfalls can be classified into four categories: (a) erroneous assumptions and expectations, (b) data design and content, (c) choice of software, and (d) conformational sampling, as well as ligand and target flexibility. A schematic representation has been shown in Figure 10.13\n.\na.\nErroneous assumptions and expectations:\u2022\nPredicting the wrong binding pose: There are a few cases where even though the predicted docking binding poses are wrong, docking screening can accidentally generate high scores to many hits.\u2022\nWater-mediated binding interactions: In many docking studies, hydrogen bonds between ligand and protein are formed by water, which is often visible in the crystal structure of the complex. Those water-mediated hydrogen bonds can be taken into account in a structure-based VS study, but it is very difficult to predict the exact number, position, and orientation of these interactions.\u2022\nSingle- versus allosteric-binding pockets: Both structure- and ligand-based VS approaches have intrinsic limitations, in that they are incapable of identifying bioactive ligands for the binding pockets, which are not explicitly docked against or implicitly represented in the training set. Again, the unknown binding site of a ligand complicates the problem of properly assessing hit rates in the VS experiments.\u2022\nProspective validation: The VS is habitually performed on data sets with known actives, but often only putatively inactive molecules. As a result, in many cases, a good number of inactive molecules are absent to identify the true inactives after the VS approach.\u2022\nDruglikeness: The majority of the VS approaches are based on the screening of druglike compounds by employing Lipinski\u2019s rule of five as the preliminary screening steps of the VS. One should remember that the rule applies only to oral bioavailability, and that many bioactivity classes such as antibiotics fall outside the scope of this rule. Hence, VS protocols are generally applied and validated on a relatively small fraction of chemical space, and their performance may change drastically from one database to another.\nb.\nData design and content:\u2022\nSize and diversity of the chemical libraries: In many cases, the employed libraries in the VS are either too small or contain too many closely related analogs, or often both. A data set that lacks sufficient chemical diversity is never an ideal choice for VS.\u2022\nExperimental errors and inappropriate bioassays: A large pool of data sets is often assembled from different sources, where different bioassay procedures and detection techniques have been used. As a consequence, there is a huge risk of experimental errors and inappropriate assays from molecule to molecule.\u2022\nBad (reactive/aggregating) molecules: The data set provided for VS often includes molecules that contain chemically reactive groups or other undesirable functionalities that may interfere with the HTS detection techniques.\u2022\nPutative inactive compounds as decoys: Experimentally confirmed inactive compounds are helpful as negative controls because only few of them should appear in the hit list when a reliable VS protocol is employed. However, many of the decoys used in VS benchmark studies are only putatively inactive; hence, some assumed true negatives may actually be positives.\nc.\nChoice of software:\u2022\nMolecule drawing/preparation: Adding implicit hydrogen atoms, handling the ionization states of the molecule, and assigning the correct charges at the initial stages of VS screening can easily be forgotten in many cases, where the final result will totally mislead the scientific community.\u2022\nInput/output errors, format incompatibility: Various errors are introduced when interconverting different molecular formats from one software to another. There is a high possibility of getting distorted information, like changes in atomic coordinates, chirality, hybridization, and protonation states of the employed compounds.\u2022\nImproper feature definitions in the pharmacophore: Incorrect feature definitions can be detrimental to the outcome of VS. In pharmacophore queries, the definition of pharmacophore features needs to be applied with caution. For example, it is known that nitrogen and oxygen atoms in the same heterocycle (such as an oxazole) do not both behave as HBAs simultaneously. In the majority of cases, the acceptor in the oxazole ring is the nitrogen.\u2022\nDisparity of algorithm from software to software: Various software tools apply different algorithms for a particular job. For example, in the case of docking for energy minimization, different forms of FFs are applied from one software to another. Therefore, there is a high probability of getting different hits and making the VS process highly dependent on the use of particular software.\u2022\nSingle predictors versus ensembles: Multiple statistical tools (both free and commercial software and descriptors) are available to perform VS studies. Each module captures different characteristics of molecular similarity. As a consequence, it is always difficult to identify a preferred tool/software/descriptor; therefore, it is often necessary to account for several approaches rather than one.\nd.\nConformational sampling as well as ligand and target flexibility:\u2022\nConformational coverage: One of the main challenges in 3D-VS is generating a convenient set of conformations to cover the molecule\u2019s conformational space effectively.\u2022\nHigh-energy conformations: One has to remember that good conformational coverage is very important, and on the contrary, high-energy or physically unrealistic conformations can be detrimental to VS. Few conformational sampling approaches do not utilize energy minimization to refine and properly rank the resulting geometries. Therefore, the resulting list could contain many false positives.\u2022\nLigand and protein flexibility: A common practice in many 3D database search systems is to set a limit on the number of conformations stored for each molecule. The number of conformations accessible to a molecule depends greatly on its size and flexibility. Of course, it is not only the ligands that are flexible; it is the biological targets as well. Protein flexibility is probably the most unexploited aspect of VS.\u2022\nAssumption of ligand overlap: In 3D shape-based VS, most programs attempt to maximize the overlap between the query and the database molecules. Indeed, different ligands may occupy different regions in the same protein, even in the same binding site, and the overlap between them in 3D space can be much less than assumed by a shape-based VS tool, resulting in more false negatives.\n\n",

Pharmacophore and docking-based approaches, employed both alone or concurrently in VS, lead to a much higher hit rate than traditional screening methods (e.g., HTS). In a complete, structurally diverse data set, pharmacophore gives immense confidence about the best probable features that are solely responsible for particular pharmacological activity. On the contrary, the docking method provides an opportunity for the designing of active compounds considering the binding aspects of the ligand with the amino acid residues in the respective receptors. Methods like CoRIA and COMBINE provide a blend of ligand- and structure-based drug design at once, where the best possible interactions of the ligand\u2013receptor complex can be identified. These methods are capable of extracting critical information regarding the nature and type of important interactions at the level of both the receptor and the ligand.",

Many successful examples have been demonstrated recently in the field of computer-aided VS for lead identification. There appears to be no universal method to execute these studies, as each biological target system is unique. Although one cannot ignore the intrinsic restrictions of VS, it remains one of the best possible options to explore a large chemical space, in terms of cost effectiveness and commitment of time and material needed. With the development of new docking methodologies, ligand-based screening techniques and machine-learning tools, the VS techniques are capable of giving better hit prediction rates, and undoubtedly, these will play the front-runner role in drug design in the near future either as a complementary approach to HTS or as a stand-alone approach. One has to remember that technologies are available that need to be employed in the right way and in the right direction to identify novel chemical substances with the scientific use of VS techniques. However, it must be emphasized that VS is not intended to replace the actual experimental approaches. As a matter of fact, the VS and experimental methods are highly complementary to each other.\n",
