PEDV isolates can be divided into two genogroups: G1, which encompasses a majority of strains isolated before 2010, and G2, which contains more recently identified strains (Huang et al., 2013). PEDV was first discovered in North America in April 2013 and since its emergence has caused substantial losses to the U.S. pork industry. The clinical disease associated with PEDV is characterized by watery diarrhea and vomiting in all ages of pigs and high mortality rates in young pigs (Pensaert and Debouck, 1978).",

Producers commonly add spray-dried plasma (SDP) of porcine or bovine origin to weaned pig diets as it has been shown to promote growth (Grinstead et al., 2000) and aids in combating common postweaning pathogens such as Escherichia coli (Torrallardona et al., 2003; Bosi et al., 2004). It is well recognized that the addition of SDP to pig feed enhances the immune response and decreases pathogen loads compared with pigs without plasma access through feed. For instance, plasma protein supplements modulated the mucosal immune response in organized and diffuse gut-associated lymphoid tissue, which is accompanied by a reduction of proinflammatory cytokine production (Bosi et al., 2004; Nofrarias et al., 2006; P\u00e9rez-Bosque et al., 2008).",

In addition, the biological neutralization activity of antibodies against common pig pathogens present in SDP was conserved and may contribute to the biosafety of commercially available SDP (Polo et al., 2013). Previously, it has also been shown that SDP has an intrinsic effect reducing survival of PEDV under in vitro conditions (Quist-Rybachuk et al., 2015). After the introduction of PEDV into the United States, concerns on possible contribution of porcine-based SDP in rapid farm-to-farm transmission were raised (Pasick et al., 2014) despite studies clearly demonstrating that PEDV is inactivated during the spray-drying process (Opriessnig et al., 2014; Pujols and Segales, 2014; Gerber et al., 2014b). To eliminate any possible risk of pig pathogen spread via SDP while retaining its benefits as part of a pig diet, pork producers may switch from porcine-origin SDP toward bovine-origin SDP (BovSDP). The purpose of this study was to determine whether there is any benefit of adding BovSDP to a diet of pigs during acute PEDV infection.",

In pet food, SDP is a preferred binder in canned food products due to its high-protein content and its physicochemical properties (Polo et al., 2005; Rodriguez et al., 2016). Porcine SDP was first introduced as protein source for pigs during the early 1990s (Cole and Sprent, 2001) and since has been used widely in the diet of weaned pigs (Torrallardona, 2010). Benefits of adding porcine SDP include improvement of weight gain mainly due to increased feed intake and reduction of incidence and severity of diarrhea after weaning (Adewole et al., 2016).

These results highlight that a higher number of animals excreted PEDV during the early stages of infection in BovSDP\u2013PEDV group. Differences in the challenge dose or challenge process can be ruled out. The PEDV inoculum was prepared in a similar manner and at the same time for both groups by a single person and stored on ice until challenge of each group. The challenge was conducted by the same personnel for both groups with approximately 20 min between the two groups. The obtained results could have been by chance due to the group sizes. Alternatively, the BovSDP\u2013PEDV animals could be more prone to excrete PEDV in the early stages in the infection. Unlike in suckling pigs that are very susceptible to PEDV infection, only 2 per 13 PEDV-infected pigs (both from the PEDV challenged groups) had to be killed due to the severity of clinical signs.

Specifically, by dpi 7, 60% of the BovSDP pigs were anti-IgG and IgA positive compared with 12.5% of the PEDV pigs. Of note, while systemic IgA antibodies were measured, mucosal IgA levels were not determined, and it is therefore unknown how the addition of the BovSDP affected the gut immunity. In a previous study, a good correlation of IgA levels in serum and feces was found (Gerber and Opriessnig, 2015), and as fecal samples and gut mucosa are more difficult to process during routine lab work, serum IgA levels are commonly tested. Explanations for the earlier humoral immune response in the BovSDP group may include acceleration of the clinical course by the dietary supplement; however, a more rapid immune response due to earlier replication of the virus in more pigs unrelated to the diet modification is also possible. Serum anti-PEDV Ig in pig serum has been demonstrated to neutralize infectivity of PEDV (Hofmann and Wyler, 1989), and bovine plasma could have a similar neutralizing activity, which was not further assessed in this study. Besides the presence of possible neutralizing antibodies in SDP, other plasma compounds such as peptides (Anderson and Anderson, 2002) could contribute to the benefits seen with SDP addition to a diet.",

Specifically, pigs fed BovSDP were able to clear virus shedding 2.1 d sooner than non-BovSDP pigs. The addition of BovSDP to the diet resulted in faster and stronger PEDV antibody responses and reduced PEDV shedding time compared with pigs with no BovSDP in the diet. Limitations of this study include the usage of one single virus titer and the low numbers of pigs tested. In addition, two PEDV pigs had to be removed early from the study, which could have impacted the outcomes. A larger study with higher numbers of pigs per group comparing porcine and bovine-derived SDP with multiple necropsy days should be conducted to further confirm the possible benefits of SDP in PEDV-infected pigs.",
