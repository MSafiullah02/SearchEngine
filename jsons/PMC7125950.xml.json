The longest segment of the upper airway\u2014the trachea\u2014begins at the inferior portion of the larynx and extends to the branch point of the main carina, a length of 10\u201316 cm. Its inner diameter is 21\u201327 mm and is supported anteriorly and laterally by 15\u201320 C-shaped, cartilaginous rings that protect the integrity of the airway1 (Fig. 1\n, panel A). It lies anterior to the esophagus; the non-reinforced, posterior wall of the trachea is appropriately compressible during swallowing. The trachea has the potential to be a \u201cforgotten zone\u201d in differential diagnoses, as pathological processes may not receive prominent clinical consideration as other more common disorders presenting with similar respiratory symptoms.2 Unlike the oropharynx, this anatomical area is beyond visualization on routine inspection; unlike the mediastinum and lung fields, it is a potential \u201cblind spot\u201d on the routine, plain radiographic examination of the chest.3 Nonetheless, the adult trachea is affected by a number of primary disorders and is also a target organ of a variety of systemic diseases. If this anatomic area is not considered in the differential diagnosis the results can be disastrous because unlike the lower airways, the upper airway has no collateral ventilation and airflow obstruction can be life threatening. This review will focus on primary and systemic diseases involving the adult trachea. Specific attention will be paid to their clinical manifestations and diagnostic hallmarks.",

Depending on the density of gas molecules, flow rate, and airway diameter; the pattern of airflow may be laminar or turbulent.4, 5 Laminar flow usually occurs in the very small airways where flow is reduced. In the larynx and trachea where air velocity is high, airflow is usually turbulent. The driving pressure for turbulent flow is proportional to the square of the flow rate and inversely related to the fifth power of the radius. Thus, a minor decrease in the radius of the upper airway results in a significant increase in the driving pressure necessary to achieve the same airflow. The inhalation of a low-density gas such as helium-oxygen mixture has been successfully used with acute upper airway obstruction as it increases the proportion of laminar flow.6 This decreases the density-dependent driving pressure required for airflow.",

Tracheal obstruction can be life-threatening acutely as, unlike the lower airways, it has no collateral ventilation. Acute obstruction is a life-threatening condition and typically presents with inspiratory stridor that is best heard in the neck, and with cough, and dyspnea. Most primary and systemic diseases involving the adult trachea are more insidious. Patients with extrathoracic stenosis may have hoarseness, inspiratory wheezing, stridor, and nonproductive cough. However, intrathoracic stenosis may cause more difficulty with expiration and worsening dyspnea in the recumbent position. In addition, patients with normal cardiopulmonary reserve may present with dyspnea only on exertion. In general, dyspnea at rest develops when the upper airway diameter is decreased by 75% (<5 mm). The presence of preexisting pulmonary disease may result in significant dyspnea at lesser degrees of airway narrowing. Furthermore, tracheobronchial stenosis may impair clearance of secretions and increase the risk of respiratory infections. Patients with tracheal disorders may have dyspnea and wheezing that mimic asthma but with no response to bronchodilators.",

Both generally occur in settings of local tracheal injury, such as prolonged endotracheal intubation or previous nonfungal infection.33\nAspergillus tracheobronchitis may also cause more severe disease with pseudomembranous and ulcerative lesions, generally in more profoundly immunocompromised individuals.33 The prognosis associated with severe disease is typically poor, in large part related to the underlying severity of immune suppression in the host. Ulcerative disease tends to have a slightly better outcome, as it is usually associated with limited involvement of the respiratory tree. Many cases have occurred in the setting of organ transplantation. They are more likely to be diagnosed early and thus respond to early antifungal therapy.34 Pseudomembranous invasive Aspergillus tracheobronchitis typically affects individuals with profound immunosuppressed states and is nearly universally fatal.34\n",

Chronic tuberculosis may also cause fibrosing mediastinitis, associated with secondary involvement of the trachea and central airways through contiguous encroachment by the mediastinal infection.

Thus, abnormal airflow pattern can give clues to the diagnosis of upper airway obstruction and prompt further evaluation. However, a normal spirometry should not preclude upper airway disorder from the differential diagnosis.88 Since evidence of expiratory airflow obstruction is usually caused by asthma or COPD, the less common conditions of the upper airways often are not considered in the differential diagnosis. The diagnosis may be further delayed because upper airway obstruction must be quite advanced before symptoms occur and lung function testing becomes abnormal. Studies suggest that an upper airway obstruction must narrow the lumen of the airway to less than 8 mm in diameter to produce abnormalities on the flow-volume loop.89, 90 When an artificial obstruction is imposed, the 1 s forced expiratory volume (FEV1), remains above 90 percent of control until the orifice is reduced to 6 mm. Peak expiratory flow may be affected with less obstruction. Although spirometry may not be a sensitive way to detect upper airway abnormalities, certain patterns suggest the diagnosis and should prompt further investigation, especially if careful efforts were taken to assure maximum effort during the testing.",

Fixed obstructions of the upper airway are those whose cross-sectional area does not change in response to transmural pressure differences during inspiration or expiration. A fixed obstruction may occur in either the intrathoracic or extrathoracic airways.

Oscillations in the inspiratory or expiratory curves have also been described, probably representing a mechanical instability of the airway wall. A plateau of forced inspiratory flow alone suggests an extrathoracic upper airway obstruction. (Fig. 3, panel B). With extrathoracic upper airway obstruction, flow is limited only during inspiration. Intraluminal pressure is subatmospheric during inspiration for both the extrathoracic and intrathoracic trachea. However, the transmural pressure of the extrathoracic trachea is negative during inspiration whereas that of the intrathoracic trachea is positive because the pressure surrounding the extrathoracic trachea is atmospheric and the pressure surrounding the intrathoracic trachea is subatmospheric. Thus the extrathoracic trachea will then be more prone to collapse during inspiration and an extrathoracic upper airway lesion would cause airflow limitation during inspiration. The opposite would be true for expiration. Poor effort may result in abnormal inspiratory curve and thus, a single inspiratory curve limitation should be confirmed by looking at all the flow-volume loops.91\n",

General therapeutic measures for acute obstruction may include elevation of the head of bed, administration of humidified oxygen, inhaled racemic epinephrine, and systemic corticosteroids. A helium\u2013oxygen gas mixture (Heliox) is a low-density gas, commonly delivered as 80% helium/20% oxygen, that can be used in management of reversible upper airway obstruction. This gas mixture has a low density because the helium is replacing nitrogen. This results in conversion of the predominantly turbulent flow at the site of obstruction to a more laminar pattern. Laminar flow requires less pressure gradient than turbulent flow to achieve the same flow rate, thus it reduces the work of breathing. Oxygen can be titrated to raise the FiO2. However, the benefit of the mixture is lost as the FiO2 of the heliox mixture increases.",
