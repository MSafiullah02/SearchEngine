            "text": "Letter to the Editor (649 words) workers are expected to work every day with COVID-19 patients, and protecting them is essential to enable them work safely and avoid being infected. Airway management and, more specifically, tracheostomy procedures have a high risk of causing contamination because they generate aerosols [2] . Even if tracheostomy procedures can be used in COVID-19 patient management, no evidence-based recommendations for the protection of healthcare workers performing tracheostomies for these patients exist to date. Pichi et al. [1] [3] . No data about the specific contamination risk of each technique for healthcare workers are available. Published information from the SARS outbreak of 2003 showed that OT was preferred [2, 4, 5] (PT had a reputation for generating more aerosols than OT due to extensive airway manipulation), but we must also consider that PT techniques have advanced since then. Current guidelines on choosing OT or PT for COVID-19 patients differ between countries (table 1) [1, 6, 7] . We recommend PT in COVID-19 patients because it does not require transferring the patient to an OR and thus limits the risk of contamination. The duration of PT (and thus care workers' exposure time) is no longer than that of OT [3] , and opening the trachea with a guide enables better control of expiratory flow than with a surgical opening, which is more hazardous. Moreover, PT eliminates the risk of piercing the endotracheal cuff. PT procedure must be conducted in a sedated patient, and ventilation must be stopped entirely during the critical step of introducing the cannula.",

The bronchoscope is inserted by a specific opening valve that protects the operator from the respiratory flow, without repeated connection and disconnection from the ventilatory circuit. A double lumen endotracheal tube can also be used, with an upper channel that allows passage of a bronchoscope during PT and with a lower channel exclusively dedicated to patient ventilation [8] . We recommend performing a neck ultrasonography systematically before PT to ensure there is no large vessel in the puncture area or a large thyroid isthmus to prevent hematoma complication. Technical options must be discussed between the ICU specialist and the surgeon for patients with anatomical particularities (difficult neck). We think that the risk of a difficult cannula re-insertion in case of unexpected decannulation is controlled, provided the patient does not have any upper airway obstruction, which enables classical orotracheal intubation.",

We completely agree about the use of personal protective measures and post-tracheostomy care. However, we suggest another approach for the other steps. Two tracheostomy procedures are currently available: open tracheostomy (OT) and percutaneous tracheostomy (PT). The first, which Pichi et al. [1] recommend, is surgically performed, most often in an operating room (OR). The surgeon inserts a tracheostomy tube following skin incision, muscle retraction, and a wide opening of the trachea. PT is typically performed by an intensive care specialist in an intensive care unit (ICU). It consists of a percutaneous tracheal puncture guided by bronchoscopy and a progressive dilatation before the insertion of the tracheostomy cannula. Most reported complications are wound infection and post-operative bleeding for OT, compressive neck hematoma and difficulty reinserting the cannula in case of unexpected decannulation for PT. However, the general complication rate of both techniques is the same",
