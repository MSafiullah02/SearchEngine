So far, turkey coronavirus (TCoV) and infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) belong to antigenic group III and share antigenic similarity. This biological characteristic allows using antigen, as well as antibody raises against IBV, to develop and apply immunological tools for the TCoV diagnosis (Guy et al., 1997; Loa et al., 2000, 2002; Culver et al., 2006).",

Actually, the IFA and the RT-PCR represent the most important tools for the diagnosis of all viruses associated to PEMS, described in the United States and Great Britain (Breslin et al., 2000; Culver et al., 2006). Besides, fresh or frozen tissues are the clinical specimens submitted to IFA, and interpretation of respective results depends on an epifluorescent microscope and an image-capture system (Shi et al., 1999; Ramos-Vara, 2005). To rapidly diagnose and effectively control turkey enteritis, new techniques would be useful, provided that they were inexpensive and could be easily applied, especially when the distance between producer areas and laboratories represents an obstacle. In this study, a simple direct immunohistochemistry (D-IHC) assay was established to detect the TCoV antigens from formalin-fixed tissues, and the results were compared with those obtained by routine IFA and conventional RT-PCR approaches.",

Briefly, \u2245200 mL of intestine suspensions was concentrated by polyethylene glycol (2.000; GIBCO-BRL, Invitrogen), 8.7% (wt/vol) added by NaCl 2.4% (wt/vol) and kept at 4\u00b0C overnight with slight shaking. After the material was centrifuged at 3,000 \u00d7 g, the precipitate was diluted at 1:10 (initial volume) and submitted to ultracentrifugation at 90,000 \u00d7 g for 4 h at 4\u00b0C. At fraction 35, the TCoV was recovered and the RNA/total protein yields measured at 280/260 nm. The coincidence peak, at 280/260 nm, was collected, pooled together, and used as a source for experimental infection after the electronic microscopic evaluation was performed. The purified virus titer was determined by inoculation of the pooled fraction at 10-fold dilutions into 5 groups of five 28-d-old embryonated turkey eggs. The 50% embryo infectious dose (EID50) was calculated by the method of Reed and Muench (1938).

The ileum portion was found to be the less sensible region for TCoV diagnosis. Moreover, in previous reports, it has been described that the ileum-cecal junction is the best region to find TCoV, from naturally and experimentally infected poults, which are in agreement with those described here (Brown et al., 1997; Ismail et al., 2003). Few numbers of positive-staining cells detected in ileum could be explained by the course of virus infection (Breslin et al., 2000). However, the TCoV antigens can be detected at 35 d after exposure, mainly in scattered villous epithelial cells presented in ileum and in early periods after infection also (Breslin et al., 2000; Ismail et al., 2003; Teixeira et al., 2007).",

In regards to the intestines analyzed here, they were flaccid, thin-walled, and filled with loose contents, and the disease was acute, with symptoms appearing and lasting for about 3 wk in field cases (Ismail et al., 2003; Culver et al., 2006).
