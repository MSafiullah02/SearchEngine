There are eight different genera classified as rabbits including Brachylagus, Bunolagus, Nesolagus, Oryctolagus, Pentalagus, Poelagus, Romerolagus, and Sylvilagus. The nonscientific names for rabbits are often confusing. An Oryctolagus cuniculus is commonly called a European rabbit. Several unique breeds of Oryctolagus cuniculus have been developed including the New Zealand White rabbit and the Dutch belted rabbit. To further complicate naming issues, the terms \u2018rabbit\u2019 and \u2018hare\u2019 are often misused when referring to common names or breeds of rabbits (Fox, 1994, Nowak and Paradiso, 1983). Animals classified in the genus Lepus are the only true hares. Oryctolagus cuniculus is the only domesticated rabbit, and consequently the only species from which unique breeds have been derived.",

Recently, Schnupf and Sansonetti (2012) reported on RT-PCR primer pairs for analysis of three chemokines (IL-8, CCL-4, and CCL20) and 16 cytokines (IL-1\u03b2, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12p35, IL12p40, IL-17A, IL-17F, IL-18, IL-21, IL-22, IFN-\u03b2, IFN-\u03b3, TGF-\u03b2, and TNF-\u03b1).

Other species (chicken, sheep, cattle, and rabbit) that have a limited number of gene segments utilize somatic gene conversion and/or somatic hypermutation (Pinheiro et al., 2011). In the former, a portion of the immunoglobulin gene is replaced with a gene sequence from a nonfunctional pseudogene. In the latter, single-nucleotide changes are made in the immunoglobulin genes (Jenne et al., 2003). In the rabbit, gene diversification occurs initially in the fetus and the neonate in sites such as the bone marrow. Subsequently, between 4 and 8 weeks of age, immature IgM+ B cells undergo further diversification in the GALT (appendix, sacculus rotundus, and Peyer\u2019s patches) (Mage et al., 2006, Pinheiro et al., 2011). Furthermore, certain species of intestinal bacteria (Bacteroides fragilis and Bacillus subtilis) are required for appendix follicle development and antibody diversification to occur (Hanson and Lanning, 2008, Mage et al., 2006).",

The WHHL rabbit has a marked deficiency of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors in the liver and other tissues. Selective breeding of the WHHL rabbit will increase the incidence of coronary artery atherosclerosis without increasing the incidence of aortic atherosclerosis (Watanabe et al., 1985).

Cardiovascular disease (Lombardi et al., 2009, Peng, 2012, Sanbe et al., 2005, Stanley et al., 2011) including models of long QT interval for exploration of treatments (Biermann et al., 2011, Jindal et al., 2012, Liu et al., 2012a, Peng, 2012, Sanbe et al., 2005, Ziv et al., 2009) and atherosclerosis (Araki et al., 2000, Masson et al., 2011, Tjwa et al., 2006) are the main focus of model development. Strains have also been developed that express human recombinant proteins in rabbit milk (Chrenek et al., 2007, Dragin et al., 2005, Hiripi et al., 2010, Houser et al., 2010, Lipinski et al., 2012, Simon et al., 2011, Soler et al., 2005). This ability can be passed down for multiple generations (Chrenek et al., 2007, Dragin et al., 2005). These human proteins have resulted in antigen production for rotavirus vaccine creation, human factor VIII that could be used to treat hemophilia (Chrenek et al., 2007, Krylov et al., 2008, Simon et al., 2011) and human growth hormone that could supplement a deficiency in that hormone (Lipinski et al., 2012). Rabbits that express enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) in various tissues have been created for the purpose tracking cells, which is important for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine studies (Chrenek et al., 2011, Takahashi et al., 2007, Yin et al., 2013).",

Transmission is by direct contact between rabbits (Wilkie et al., 2012). Coinfection with Bordetella bronchiseptica may be observed in clinically affected rabbits (Deeb et al., 1990). Stress-related factors associated with pasteurellosis include crowded or unsanitary conditions, transportation, and high ammonia concentrations in the air (Confer et al., 2001). Previous studies reported a high prevalence of P. multocida infection (Jaslow et al., 1981). Colonization in immature rabbits occurs more commonly in the sinuses followed by the trachea, middle ears, and lungs (Glass and Beasley, 1989). Similar to cats and dogs, rabbits may transmit P. multocida infection to humans (Per et al., 2010, Silberfein et al., 2006).",

Nasal lavage can also be used as a culture sample to isolate Pasteurella (Suckow et al., 2002). P. multocida isolates can be classified into five serogroups based on capsular antigens (A, B, D, E, and F) and into 16 serotypes based on somatic LPS antigens (Adler et al., 1999, Liu et al., 2012b, Manning, 1982). Biochemical characterization of isolates may show high heterogeneity; however, REP-PCR and phylogenetic analysis using 16S ribosomal RNA and rpoB genes can be used for precise characterization of rabbit isolates (Stahel et al., 2009). Classification of P. multocida into subspecies and/or by virulence profiles is useful for epidemiological investigations (Ferreira et al., 2012, Stahel et al., 2009). Random amplified polymorphic DNA PCR (RAPD-PCR) has also been used to subtype rabbit P. multocida isolates (Al-Haddawi et al., 1999, Dabo et al., 2000, Williams et al., 1990). PCR can detect capsule biosynthesis genes cap A, B, D, E, and F as well as virulence-related genes (Ferreira et al., 2012). Serological tests can be used to detect antibodies against P. multocida (Deeb et al., 1990, Delong et al., 1992, DiGiacomo et al., 1990, Glass and Beasley, 1989, Lukas et al., 1987).",

Immunization of rabbits with inactivated heat-labile P. multocida toxin or a commercial swine P. multocida bacterin-toxoid conferred protective immunity against challenge with the P. multocida heat-labile toxin (Suckow, 2000, Suckow et al., 1995). A vaccine administered intranasally stimulated immunity against experimental pneumonic pasteurellosis and significantly reduced nasal bacterial counts (Confer et al., 2001). Oral immunization of rabbits with a P. multocida thiocyanate extract (PTE) in microparticles was immunogenic and significantly reduced the colony-forming units of homologous P. multocida recovered from the lungs and nasopharynx (Suckow et al., 2002). Protective immunity to a heterologous strain of P. multocida can be achieved by vaccinating rabbits with PTE via the subcutaneous route (Suckow et al., 2008). A P. multocida bacterin known as BunnyVac is currently licensed by the USDA and is intended to be effective in preventing death and limiting disease due to Pasteurella in rabbits. BunnyVac is manufactured by Colorado Serum Company and distributed by Pan American Veterinary Laboratories (http://pavlab.com/). Control of pasteurellosis in rabbitries entails testing and culling animals that are positive for Pasteurella spp. (Ferreira et al., 2012). Furthermore, rabbits free of Pasteurella and other infectious agents can be obtained by enrofloxacin treatment and through cesarean section or hysterectomy rederivation (Pleasants, 1959, Suckow et al., 1996, Syukuda, 1979). Commercial suppliers of laboratory rabbits tend to exclude Pasteurella from their colonies.",

Antibiotic treatment of affected rabbits can alleviate clinical signs or delay disease progression but may not eradicate the disease (El Tayeb et al., 2004, Ferreira et al., 2012). Antibiotic treatment may suppress virulence gene expression without complete elimination of P. multocida (Boyce et al., 2012). Internal abscesses may not be treatable using antibiotics (Franco and Cronin, 2008). Penicillin therapy does not seem to be effective against Pasteurella infection and may also lead to diarrhea and Clostridium difficile colitis in rabbits (Jaslow et al., 1981, Rehg and Lu, 1981). One study from Brazil determined that all tested strains were sensitive to ceftiofur, florfenicol, norfloxacin, enrofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, tetracycline, and doxycycline (Ferreira et al., 2012). Other studies also indicate that fluoroquinolones are useful for the treatment of P. multocida infection in rabbits (Abo-El-Sooud and Goudah, 2010, Broome and Brooks, 1991, Franco and Cronin, 2008, Hanan et al., 2000, Okewole and Olubunmi, 2008).

Therefore, the spore, a resistant stage, appears to be the essential element in the transmission of Tyzzer\u2019s disease (Ganaway, 1980, Ganaway et al., 1971). Contact with soiled bedding or diseased rabbits have been used experimentally to transmit the disease to other rabbits (Allen et al., 1965). It is possible that subclinically infected rabbits (carriers) may introduce the organism into a colony (Allen et al., 1965, Pritt et al., 2010). In mice, increased susceptibility to infection has been associated with stress (Allen et al., 1965). Furthermore, treatment with cyclophosphamide, cortisone, and prednisolone has been used experimentally to reproduce the disease in animals, suggesting that immunosuppression plays a role in pathogenesis (Allen et al., 1965, Cutlip et al., 1971, Pritt et al., 2010). Animals stressed by poor environmental conditions including overcrowding and extreme temperatures can develop the disease (Cutlip et al., 1971, Wobeser et al., 2009). Significant modifications of the intestinal flora and an impaired immune system may play a role in pathogenesis (Licois, 1986). C. piliforme may be transported from the intestine to the liver through the portal circulation and to the heart through the lymphatics (Allen et al., 1965). Some C. piliforme isolates can induce cytopathic effects on cell cultures, and in vivo, concomitant infection with other enteric pathogens such as E. coli may contribute to the severity of the disease (Prescott, 1977, Riley et al., 1992).",

Intestinal lesions are common, and histologically are characterized by necrosis of the mucosa and edema of the submucosa and serosa (Allen et al., 1965). Bacilli appear as bundles of parallel rods or as criss crossed sticks in the cytoplasm of epithelial cells distributed from the surface of the mucosa to the base of the glands (Allen et al., 1965). The lesions in the liver are punctate areas of parenchymal necrosis that appear grossly as white spots, usually \u2264 2 mm in diameter. Large numbers of bacilli are found in the cytoplasm of cells in the zone of transition between the necrotic lesion and the healthy parenchyma (Allen et al., 1965). Myocardial lesions appear as white streaks 0.5\u20132 mm wide and 4\u20138 mm long extending from the region of the left interventricular groove laterally across the left ventricle (Allen et al., 1965). In the myocardium, bacilli may be noted in partially degenerated and normal looking cells at the sharply delineated borders of the lesions (Allen et al., 1965).",

A study determined that disease results from exposure of weanling rabbits to C. spiroforme and also from exposure of adult rabbits with a disrupted gut flora (due to clindamycin treatment) to C. spiroforme suggesting that this bacterium is not a normal component of the rabbit gut flora (Carman and Borriello, 1984). C. spiroforme-mediated diarrhea may be favored by maldigestion initiated by infectious agents and/or nutritional factors (Peeters et al., 1986). Other clostridia, E. coli (EPEC), viruses, and parasites, may coinfect rabbits (Peeters et al., 1986). The iota toxin of C. spiroforme binds the same host cell receptor as the iota toxin of C. perfringens and the binary toxin of C. difficile (Papatheodorou et al., 2012).

Genome sequencing revealed that T. paraluiscuniculi evolved from a T. pallidum-like ancestor and adapted to rabbits during loss of infectivity to humans (Smajs et al., 2011). T. paraluiscuniculi can also infect hares, and causes seroconversion, but no clinical signs. In contrast, the related organism, T. paraluisleporis, can infect and induce disease in rabbits and hares. The close phylogenetic association between T. paraluiscuniculi and T. paraluisleporis suggests that these organisms could be given a subspecies or ecovar status rather than species status (Lumeij et al., 2013).",

The prevalence of T. paraluiscuniculi infection increased with parity in adult females and most adult males seroconverted within 6 months of entering the breeding program. These findings suggested that T. paraluiscuniculi spreads by horizontal transmission in adult rabbits (DiGiacomo et al., 1983). In an enzootically infected conventional rabbit colony, the frequency of venereal spirochetosis was lower in rabbits less than 6 months of age than in adult rabbits (Cunliffe-Beamer and Fox, 1981b). Experiments involving cross fostering of newborns indicated that infection occurred at birth (vertical transmission) and during the suckling period (Cunliffe-Beamer and Fox, 1981b). In addition, horizontal transmission by coitus and skin contact occurs (Small and Newman, 1972). Experimental topical or intradermal-subcutaneous genital inoculation of adult rabbits confirmed these routes of transmission (Cunliffe-Beamer and Fox, 1981b).",

Thickening of the mucosa was associated with distention of the lamina propria with macrophages and the enlargement of the lymph nodes was also associated with infiltration of macrophages (Umemura et al., 1982). Minute bacilli were observed in the apical cytoplasm of mucosal epithelial cells using toluidine blue (Umemura et al., 1982). Thickening of the cecum and proximal colon has also been reported (Hotchkiss et al., 1996). In another study, no gross lesions were found in the small intestine, but two suckling rabbits had reddened ceca with congested vessels (Schoeb and Fox, 1990). In this study two types of microscopic lesions were characterized: (1) erosive and suppurative cecitis and colitis, and (2) proliferative lesions in the cecum, sacculated colon, ileum, and distal jejunum, or a combination of these (Schoeb and Fox, 1990). Some animals had both erosive and proliferative lesions. Narrow curved or spiral bacteria were detected in rabbits with erosive and proliferative lesions using Warthin\u2013Starry stain and these bacteria were more abundant in cases with severe lesions (Schoeb and Fox, 1990). Proliferative intestinal lesions contained curved to spiral argyrophilic intracellular bacteria in the apical cytoplasm of crypt enterocytes (Hotchkiss et al., 1996).",

These assays can be used for ante mortem diagnosis of proliferative enteropathy in pigs (Pedersen et al., 2010). PCR primers used to diagnose Lawsonia in other animals species have been used in rabbit cases (Cooper et al., 1997b, Duhamel et al., 1998, Fox et al., 1994, Horiuchi et al., 2008, Hotchkiss et al., 1996, Jones et al., 1993). Other diagnostic methods include enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using synthetic peptides of LsaA and immunomagnetic separation using anti-LsaA antibody to capture L. intracellularis in fecal samples followed by detection with ATP bioluminescence (Watarai et al., 2004, Watarai et al., 2005). In tissue sections, L. intracellularis can be detected using silver stains such as Warthin\u2013Starry stain (Duhamel et al., 1998, Horiuchi et al., 2008, Hotchkiss et al., 1996, Schauer et al., 1998, Schoeb and Fox, 1990). Indirect immunofluorescence has also been used in deparaffinized intestinal sections from infected rabbits (Schoeb and Fox, 1990). Immunohistochemistry using antiserum against synthetic peptides of LsaA has also been used to detect L. intracellularis in the ileum of a naturally infected rabbit (Watarai et al., 2004). Electron microscopy reveals organisms that are ~0.23\u20130.32 \u03bcm wide and \u2264 1.7 \u03bcm long in the apical cytoplasm of \u00advillous and crypt epithelial cells (Duhamel et al., 1998). L. intracellularis can be cultured from homogenized intestinal tissue in cell lines including IEC-18 (rat small \u00adintestinal cells) and McCoy cells (mouse fibroblasts) (Lawson and Gebhart, 2000, Watarai et al., 2008). A quantitative PCR (qPCR) assay that is able to assess the growth of L. intracellularis in cultured cells has also been used to detect the organisms in pig fecal samples and could be used in other animal species (Drozd et al., 2010).",

Rabbits with the disease may or may not present with \u2018pox\u2019 lesions in the skin. The animals have a fever and nasal discharge 2 or 3 days after infection. Most rabbits have eye lesions including blepharitis, conjunctivitis, and keratitis with subsequent corneal ulceration. Skin lesions, when present, are widespread. They begin as a macular rash and progress to papules up to 1 cm in diameter by 5 days postinfection. The lymph nodes are enlarged, the face is often edematous, and there may be lesions in the oral and nasal cavity. At gross necropsy, nodules can be found in the liver, gall bladder, spleen, lung, and reproductive organs. Necrosis is widespread. Characteristic cytoplasmic inclusions seen in many poxvirus infections are rare in this disease. Mortality is high in affected animals. The virus is apparently spread by aerosols and is difficult to control. Rabbit pox is used as a model of smallpox in humans in response to the potential use of smallpox as a bioterrorism agent. It is an effective model for the evaluation of potential therapies against smallpox (Nalca and Nichols, 2011, Rice et al., 2011).",

LHV-2 (Herpesvirus cuniculi) was isolated from domestic rabbits (O. cuniculus) and causes subclinical infections. LHV-3 (Herpesvirus sylvilagus) was isolated from cottontail rabbits. Cottontail rabbits infected with the virus develop a lymphoproliferative disease with lymphoid infiltration of many organs (Hesselton et al., 1988). LHV-3 does not infect domestic rabbits. LHV-1\u20133 are tentatively classified in the genus Radinovirus, subfamily Gammaherpesvirinae. LHV-4 was isolated from domestic rabbits and caused severe disease in preweanlings (Jin et al., 2008a, Jin et al., 2008b). Clinical signs included weakness, anorexia, conjunctivitis, keratitis, and periocular swelling. Some animals also developed skin ulcers. LHV-4 is genus Simplexvirus, subfamily Alphaherpesvirinae.",

One or two doses were utilized for effective treatment. Treatment of moderate to severe infestations with ivermectin alone can fail. Using adjunct vitamin therapy to minimize oxidative tissue damage has been shown to enhance treatment success (Singh et al., 2012). A single dose of topical selamectin at a minimum of 6 mg/kg selamectin (Kurtdede et al., 2007) and a single injection of eprinomectin at 200 or 300 \u03bcg/kg (Pan et al., 2006) were found to be effective treatments. Regardless of treatment modality, it is generally recommended that the entire group of rabbits be treated at the same time. Heat (40\u00b0C) and desiccation (<20% humidity) will kill parasites that are not on the host (Arlain et al., 1984).",

M. canis-infected hairs fluoresce with an apple-green color and can be collected for microscopic examination and culture (Chermette et al., 2008). The results of the Wood\u2019s lamp examination should be systematically \u00adconfirmed by direct examination of hairs and/or \u00adfungal culture (Chermette et al., 2008). Deep skin scraping should be performed to obtain hair and scales and confirm the absence of ectoparasites such as mites that can be associated with dermatophytosis (Cafarchia et al., 2010, Chermette et al., 2008). Clearing solutions such as chlorolactophenol or 10% potassium hydroxide (KOH) can then be used to digest keratin prior to microscopic examination (Chermette et al., 2008, Robert and Pihet, 2008). The surface of the hair typically demonstrates clusters or chains of arthroconidia (Chermette et al., 2008). Giemsa-stained skin scrapings allow observation of the arthroconidia along the hair (Chermette et al., 2008).",

The fungal culture must be complemented with direct examination of samples for optimal interpretation of the results (Chermette et al., 2008, Robert and Pihet, 2008). Samples for fungal culture may include hairs, scales, crusts, skin scrapes, and tissue biopsies (Chermette et al., 2008). Samples that are obtained from the margin of new skin lesions enhance fungal recovery by culture (Chermette et al., 2008). A brush can also be impressed on the surface of the culture medium after combing the fur and obtaining fungal spores with hair and debris (Robert and Pihet, 2008). Two media that can be used for fungal culture include Sabouraud dextrose agar (supplemented with cycloheximide and antibiotics) and Dermatophyte Test Media (DTM) (Chermette et al., 2008, Robert and Pihet, 2008). If histological examination is performed, periodic acid Schiff (PAS), or methylamine silver stain can be used to detect arthroconidia and hyphae (Chermette et al., 2008). Molecular methods to identify dermatophytes have also been described and include PCR-RFLP and sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region (Chermette et al., 2008, Kanbe, 2008, Robert and Pihet, 2008). Specific identification of the dermatophyte is essential for a better understanding of the epidemiology and prevention of the disease (Chermette et al., 2008).",

P. oryctolagi is transmitted through the transplacental route (Cere et al., 1997a, Sanchez et al., 2007) and through direct contact and aerosolization (Cere and Polack, 1999, Cere et al., 1997b, Hughes, 1982, Wakefield, 1994, Wakefield, 1996). Spontaneous pneumocystosis can occur at weaning, evolves during 7\u201310 days, and induces lung lesions and blood biochemical profile changes (Dei-Cas et al., 2006, Soulez et al., 1989). The organisms attach specifically to Type 1 epithelial alveolar cells and proliferate, filling up pulmonary alveoli cavities leading to respiratory failure (Dei-Cas et al., 2006). Changes in surfactant appear to be necessary for Pneumocystis proliferation (Prevost et al., 1997). Pneumocystis colonization decreases and becomes very low in 60-day-old rabbits (Dei-Cas et al., 2006). Most rabbits recover from pneumocystosis within 3\u20134 weeks (Dei-Cas et al., 2006). The spontaneous resolution of pneumocystosis in rabbits may be associated with expression of interferon gamma (Allaert et al., 1997). Immunosuppression may be suspected in cases of severe pulmonary disease associated with spontaneous pneumocystosis (Sheldon, 1959).",

Other parameters of blood coagulation were normal, including prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, specific clotting factor activities, platelet factor III function, platelet count, and bleeding time (Zimmerman et al., 1971). Abnormal platelet response is also characteristic of this syndrome in the rabbit (Lee et al., 1974). Complement C6-deficient rabbits are protected against diet-induced atherosclerosis despite having similar profiles in cholesterol levels and plasma lipoprotein. When compared to normal rabbits, differences in atherosclerotic plaque formation were discernible macroscopically, with extensive aortic lesions being visible in all normal rabbits while absent in all C6-deficient animals (Schmiedt et al., 1998).

By ultrastructural examination, dystrophic axons were filled with tubulovesicular material, appearing as stalks of parallel membranes and dense bodies similar to what is described in human neuroaxonal dystrophies (NAD).

The serum of this deficient rabbit lacked the immunochemical and functional alpha-gamma-subunit of C8 (C8D). This syndrome is transmitted as a simple autosomal recessive trait. The syndrome is characterized by smaller body weight compared to those of heterozygous and normal rabbits. In addition, survival rates for the first 3 months of life of the deficient animals tended to be lower than those of heterozygous and normal littermates (Komatsu et al., 1985). All C8D rabbits (more than 180 animals obtained thus far) were consistently smaller than normal littermates from birth to adulthood, i.e., 86% of normal size at birth, 57% of normal size at 35 days of age, and 68% of normal size at adulthood. The C8\u03b1-\u03b3 deficiency in rabbits is always associated with dwarfism. Furthermore, there appears to be a discrete recessive dwarf gene (dw-2), whose locus is not linked to C8D. Rabbits double-homozygous for C8D and dw-2 (severe dwarf) were smaller than the C8D or dwarf rabbits and almost all of the severe dwarf rabbits died within 35 days after birth. The actual and relative weights of the thymus in the C8D rabbits were consistently lower than those of normal rabbits, but histological examination of the C8D thymus did not reveal any abnormalities. The C8D and dwarf rabbits were fertile; however, crosses of C8D females with C8D or dwarf males led to a reduced delivery rate and small litter size. The C8D locus is loosely linked to the C3 hypocomplementemic locus (C3-hypo) (map distance 24 cM) but not to the hemoglobin blood group locus (Komatsu et al., 1990).",

The KHC rabbits also had decreased serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentration, about one-third the value in clinically normal rabbits. In addition, the serum lipoprotein electrophoretic patterns were characterized by a strong, broad beta-lipoprotein band and a diminished alpha-lipoprotein band. Fractionation of lipoprotein lipids revealed increased cholesterol, phospholipid, and triglyceride in the LDL fraction; increased cholesterol and phospholipid in the very LDL fraction; and decreased cholesterol and triglyceride in the high-density lipoprotein fraction. The inheritance is thought to be a single autosomal recessive gene mutation, and analysis of the LDL receptor indicated that the KHC rabbit has a 12-base pair deletion in the LDL receptor mRNA.

These lesions include enlarged kidneys, splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, and lymphadenopathy. Older rabbits have presented with skin nodules and eye lesions; however, malignant lymphomas in the rabbit are seldom leukemic. Most cases of malignant lymphoma appear to resemble the lymphoblastic subtype as seen in humans and mice. Malignant lymphoma is more prevalent in some strains of rabbits than in others, and there is some evidence for a retroviral cause of lymphomas in rabbits (Weisbroth, 1994). True thymomas (containing both lymphoid and epithelial components) (Vernau et al., 1995) and plasma cell myelomas (Pascal, 1961) are rare in rabbits.

A 9-year retrospective study of hematuria in 14 New Zealand White rabbits was conducted by Garibaldi (Garibaldi et al., 1987). Physical examination, laboratory tests, radiography, and postmortem examination were \u00adutilized in most cases to verify the presence of hematuria and to determine its etiology. Uterine adenocarcinoma was diagnosed in two rabbits. Three rabbits had uterine polyps with hemorrhage. Renal infarction with hemorrhage was diagnosed in three rabbits. Urolithiasis with secondary urethral obstruction and hemorrhagic cystitis was identified as the cause of hematuria in four rabbits. Other causes of hematuria included chronic cystitis, disseminated intravascular coagulation, bladder polyps and pyelonephritis. Hematuria of undetermined origin was observed in one rabbit which emphasizes that hyperpigmented urine should be a rule out in all cases of suspected hematuria in rabbits (Garibaldi et al., 1987). One case of urolithiasis with hydronephrosis in a New Zealand White rabbit was also reported (Labranche and Renegar, 1996). This condition must be distinguished from hematuria caused by endometrial venous aneurysm in female rabbits (Bray et al., 1992).",

Although the obstruction occurred at the dorsal flexure, it is not clear if this was due to congenital rather than acquired stenosis. In a retrospective study of 28 rabbits it was determined that the mean age of the rabbits presenting with ocular discharge from the nasolacrimal duct was 4.4 years. In 25 rabbits (89%), dacryocystitis was a unilateral finding. No underlying cause could be determined in 10 animals (35%). Dental malocclusion was observed in 14 rabbits (50%) and rhinitis in two animals (7%), with one animal showing both signs (4%). One rabbit (4%) presented with panophthalmitis. Most animals (96%) received topical antibiotic treatment. Regarding the clinical outcome, 12 animals (43%) showed complete recovery, eight rabbits (28%) were euthanized, three (11%) died due to unrelated causes, and three (11%) were lost to follow-up. Two rabbits (7%) continued to display signs of dacryocystitis (Florin et al., 2009).",
