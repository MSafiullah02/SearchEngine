It was first isolated from children with acute respiratory tract infections in the Netherlands in 2001 [Van den Hoogen et al., 2001]. The genomic organization of hMPV is similar to that of human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) [Van den Hoogen et al., 2002], harboring one open reading frame (ORF) for at least eight viral proteins (3\u2032\u2010N\u2010P\u2010M\u2010F\u2010M2\u2010SH\u2010G\u2010L\u20105\u2032) but lacking the non\u2010structural genes, NS1 and NS2. hMPV is divided into four subtypes: A1, A2, B1, and B2 based on the genetic analysis of sequences of hMPV isolates [Bastien et al., 2003; Van den Hoogen et al., 2004; Huck et al., 2006].",

The diagnosis of community\u2010acquired pneumonia followed a guideline issued by the Chinese Medical Association. In brief, community\u2010acquired pneumonia was clinically defined as the presence of signs and symptoms of pneumonia caused by an infection acquired outside the hospital [The Working Group for Respiratory Diseases of Pediatric Society, 2007; Xiang et al., 2010].

PCR products were analyzed by electrophoresis on a 2% agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide. The 240 bp amplicons were cloned into a pMD\u201018T vector (Takara, Dalian, China) and verified by sequence analysis. hMPV types/sub\u2010types were determined by alignment of the PCR sequences with prototype strains of hMPV, including the isolates of subtype A1 (strain 00\u20101, GenBank Accession No. AF371337), A2 (strain CAN97\u201083, GenBank Accession No. AY297749), B1 (strain NL/1/99, GenBank Accession No.AY525843), and B2 (strain CAN98\u201075, GenBank Accession No. AY297748) by BLAST (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi) and Clustal W which is implemented in the DNASTAR software [Burland, 2000].

For instance, the rate of hMPV/RSV co\u2010infection was 22.2% in Israel [Wolf et al., 2010] and 28.2% in Spain [Cilla et al., 2008]. The reason for this difference is unclear, but could be attributed to different detection methods. A direct immunofluorescence assay (DFA) and tissue culture methods were used in the study in Israel [Wolf et al., 2010]; whereas a nested\u2010PCR or PCR method different from the RT\u2010PCR method employed here was used in the study in Spain [Cilla et al., 2008].",

Consistent with a previous study [Cilla et al., 2008], hMPV\u2010A2 was the most frequently detected subtype in pediatric patients with community\u2010acquired pneumonia. hMPV\u2010A1 was not detected in this study. hMPV\u2010A1 was also not found in patients with other lower respiratory tract infections (data not shown). These results agree with those of previous reports from Tianjin, China [Li et al., 2009] and from Korea [Chung et al., 2008]. In contrast, in Taiwan, China (between February 2006 and February 2009) [Wang et al., 2008] and in Brazil (between January 2003 and December 2006) [Oliveira et al., 2009], all four hMPV subtypes were detected in patients with lower respiratory tract infections. In another report from Gansu Province, China (between December 2006 and November 2008), hMPV\u2010B2 was not detected [Xiao et al., 2010]; whereas in Chongqing, China (between April 2006 and March 2008), hMPV\u2010A1 and hMPV\u2010B1 were not detected [Chen et al., 2010]. Taken together with findings in this study, these reports suggest that the prevalence of hMPV subtypes varies among different geographical locations. Long term surveillance of hMPV infections are needed to better understand the distribution of hMPV subtypes, to prevent possible outbreaks, and to inform vaccine development.",
