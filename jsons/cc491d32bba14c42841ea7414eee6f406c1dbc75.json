            "text": "To investigate to what extent coronavirus vectors can induce antitumoral and antiviral humoral and cellular immune responses in vivo, we generated vectors based on mouse hepatitis virus to be used for studies of the immunological response to antigens expressed on murine dendritic cells. In these vectors, the structural genes encoding the viral envelope (E) and membrane (M) proteins have been deleted and replaced by sequences encoding a reporter protein (green fluorescent protein [GFP]) fused to an Coronavirus-based vectors are currently considered a promising means to deliver multiple heterologous genes to specific target cells. During replication of the coronavirus RNA genome in the host cell cytoplasm, 6-8 subgenomic mRNAs encoding for structural and accessory proteins are produced. Most of these genes can be replaced by heterologous genes without affecting RNA replication. 1, 2 This allows the insertion of more than 6 kb into coronavirus-based vectors. [1] [2] [3] [4] Replication without a DNA intermediate in the host cell cytoplasm makes insertion of vector-derived sequences into the host cell genome unlikely. This, together with replacement of structural viral genes in the vector by heterologous sequences, makes these noninfectious vectors safe. An important consideration for viral vaccine vectors is the potential to efficiently deliver genetic material to specific target cells. Targeting of viral vaccine vectors to professional antigen-presenting cells, such as dendritic cells (DCs), is highly desirable in order to optimize vaccine efficacy. 5, 6 The receptors of human coronavirus 229E and mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) are expressed on DCs, [7] [8] [9] indicating that vectors based on these viruses can be used to deliver genetic cargo efficiently to DCs via receptor-mediated transduction. 1 Therefore, recombinant MHV vectors in the context of a murine model can serve as a paradigm for the development and evaluation of coronavirus vaccine vectors suitable for in vitro and in vivo transduction of human DCs.",

Vector RNA-transfected packaging cells replicated and transcribed recombinant vector RNA as shown by reporter gene expression and syncytia formation in cell cultures. Vector RNA was packaged into viral-like particles as shown by transduction of dendritic cells after transfer of cell culture supernatants from vector transfected packaging cells. Further studies will address activation and antigen presentation of vector-transduced dendritic cells in a mouse model. Stable integration in packaging cells of the sequence encoding either MHV S, or of a chimeric S protein that will give vector particles the ability to transduce human dendritic cells, will further improve the applicability of these packaging cell lines for production of vectors for immunotherapeutical studies.",
