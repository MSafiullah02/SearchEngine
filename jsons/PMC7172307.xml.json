Among these positive specimens, eight were collected from male patients and two were collected from females. The ages of WUPyV-positive patients ranged from 2 months to 7 years (mean age of 25.4 months; median age of 12.7 months). Eight (2.7%) were from 297 patients <3 years old and 2 (1.7%) from 118 patients >3 years old. WUPyV-positive cases were detected in 7 of the 10 months during which specimens were collected (not in May, June, and August; no collection in January or February), suggesting that WUPyV infection is not seasonally associated. Co-infection with additional respiratory pathogens was detected in all 10 WUPyV-positive specimens, with HRV (6/10) and RSV (4/10) being the most frequently co-detected viral agents. PIV3 (1/10), PIV4 (1/10) and MP (2/10) were also co-detected in some of WUPyV-positive samples. One sample was WUPyV-negative using primers targeting the VP2 gene and WUPyV-positive using primers targeting the LTAg gene. It is unclear why this sample tested negative initially. We subsequently amplified the VP2 gene in a nested PCR reaction using two sets of primers: those targeting the full-length VP2 gene, and the original VP2-specific detecting primers described before.1\n",

Significantly, no positive cases were detected among the population sampled. Although prior studies have reported the presence of WUPyV and KIPyV in adults, the populations sampled in these studies corresponded to immunocompromised patients suffering from leukemia, HIV infection or other diseases, or undergoing transplant therapy.1, 9 Thus, in combination with previous reports, our data suggest that WUPyV and KIPyV infection of adults only occurs when they are immunosuppressed or have other significant health deficiencies. However, before making this conclusion, we must consider the limitations associated with particular specimen types on viral detection. In our study, adult specimens were collected using throat and nasal swabs. As the viral load in such specimens is usually lower than in NPAs,16 it is possible that the prevalence of WUPyV and KIPyV has been considerably underestimated. Future studies focusing on the prevalence of WUPyV and KIPyV in adults should therefore assay lower respiratory tract samples, such as bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF).",
