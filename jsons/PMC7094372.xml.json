The HPS represented a 70-kg adult man sitting on a 45\u00b0 inclined hospital bed. It was programmed to breathe spontaneously to mimic mild lung injury. The lung compliance was set as 35 mL/cm H2O, and the oxygen consumption was set as 300 mL/min. Tidal volume and respiratory rate were regulated so that a respiratory exchange ratio of 0.8 was maintained during measurements. Typically, this was achieved with a tidal volume of 300 mL and a respiratory rate of 25 breaths/min.13, 14\n",

In this regard, the deliberate leakage via the exhalation ports may generate droplet nuclei and disperse infective aerosols through evaporation of water content of respiratory droplets and resulting in a superspreading event.23 Nonetheless, NPPV has been applied to a small number of human H5N1 infections without causing any nosocomial outbreak, although the patients eventually died of multiorgan failure despite invasive mechanical ventilatory support.24, 25 There were also anecdotal reports26, 27 that NPPV applied using a single circuit was effective in treating respiratory failure due to SARS and might reduce the need for intubation. However, a case-control study28 involving 124 medical wards in 26 hospitals in Guangzhou and Hong Kong has identified SARS patients requiring oxygen therapy and NPPV as independent risk factors for superspreading nosocomial outbreaks of SARS.

            "text": "This study showed that the maximum exhaled air dispersion distance from the ComfortFull 2 mask was 0.95 m at a predictable direction from the exhalation diffuser perpendicular to the HPS, but leakage though the Image 3 mask, connected to the Whisper Swivel exhalation port, was far more extensive and diffuse. The Whisper Swivel is an efficient exhalation device to prevent carbon dioxide rebreathing, but it would not be advisable to use such an exhalation port in managing patients with febrile respiratory illness of unknown etiology, especially in the setting of an influenza pandemic with high human-to-human transmission potential for fear of causing major nosocomial infection. It is also important to avoid the use of higher IPAP, which could lead to wider distribution of exhaled air and substantial room contamination as demonstrated in this study. The World Health Organization interim guidelines on the prevention and control of acute respiratory diseases in health care has included NPPV among those aerosol-generating procedures in which there is a possibility of an increased risk of respiratory pathogen transmission. In addition to maintaining contact, droplet, and standard precautions among the health-care workers when providing routine care to such patients, the World Health Organization recommends31 full personal protection equipment for the health-care workers covering the torso, arms, eyes, nose, and mouth, and this should include a long-sleeved gown, single-use gloves, eye protection, and a N95 mask or the equivalent as the minimum level of respiratory protection. NPPV should be provided in an adequately ventilated single room, and the addition of an expiratory port with a bacterial/viral filter can reduce aerosol emission.31\n",

The inertia and weight of larger droplets in an air droplet two-phase flow would certainly cause them to have less horizontal dispersion than the continuous air carrier phase in which they travel due to increased inertia and drag. However, the evaporation of water content in some droplets during NPPV may produce droplet nuclei suspended in air, whereas the larger droplets will fall to the ground in a trajectory pathway.25 As the smoke particles in this study mark the continuous air phase, our data contours are referring to exhaled air. Our results would therefore represent the \u201cupper bound\u201d estimates for the dispersion of droplets, which would be expected to follow a shorter trajectory than the air jet due to gravitational effects but not fully reflect the risk of droplet transmission.8, 10, 11, 12 Similarly, we would expect a higher concentration of droplets closer to the floor than that estimated by our contours because of the shorter trajectory of the droplets.",
