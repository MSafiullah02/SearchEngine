Not surprisingly, there is also significant variation among the time to most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) estimates for RHDV, with estimated mean coalescent ranging from 1917 [12] to 1967 [13]. As RHD was first described in 1984 [12,14-16,25], the oldest TMRCA implies that the coalescent of virulent RHDV antedates the emergence of RHD by almost seven decades. In the absence of an intermediate reservoir host, it is uncommon for the emergence of an acute, virulent virus to be so extensively decoupled from the appearance of its associated disease [3,26-31]. As a result, there has been significant debate over the timing, location, and mechanisms of RHDV \u2019s emergence [12,14,15,25,32,33].",

As this range of evolutionary rates is atypical for a gene of a single viral species, a systematic investigation was undertaken to explain variation among published nucleotide substitution rate and TMRCA estimates for RHDV. A combination of jackknifing controls was used to produce robust rate estimates for the VP60 gene and the first estimated substitution rate for RHDV \u2019s RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene. These controls reveal that using one misdated taxon significantly slows the estimated rates, unnecessarily lengthening RHDV \u2019s TMRCA. We demonstrate the fragility of tip-calibrated evolutionary analyses and propose jackknife control BEAST runs as a way to identify potential misdated taxa.",

Whether attenuated or improperly inactivated, the strain could have been released into China, and now this lineage can be isolated from other regions of China and Russia ([50,51]; see GenBank file for HM623309 and FJ794179). This is similar to the lab-escape strain that complicated substitution rate estimation for Influenza A virus [40]. Instead of changing many dates of isolation, however, only AY269825 would have to be assigned a different date (removing the four taxa that grouped with AY269825 did not change the estimated substitution rate or TMRCA of RHDV, data not shown). Previous studies have shown that the long-term rate of viral evolution in the lab can mimic the rate in nature [52], so unlike the 20 years of frozen stasis that the Influenza isolate experienced, AY269825 was changing at a rate similar to its wild relatives.",

Without AY269825, the TMRCA for the entire virulent RHDV complex and each of its lineages is substantially lower, resolving the much of the debate over its puzzling evolutionary history. Indeed, without this misdated taxon, the ancestor of the entire complex is estimated to have existed between 1955-1978 (Table 1), as few as six years before the 1984 appearance of RHD. These results cannot address whether virulence was a shared trait of the most recent common ancestor of RHDV, or if it evolved independently in multiple lineages. Whenever virulence did evolve, it did not have to go undocumented for several decades [9,12,14,15,23,25,32,33].",

This underscores the problem of using congruence with a strict molecular clock as the sole means of assessing the validity of dates of isolation. Deviation from the root-to-tip regression line is expected for viruses with variable rates of evolution, which would be accurately modeled with a relaxed molecular clock BEAST analysis [11,53-57]. Indeed, correlation between genetic distance and time was stronger for the VP60 dataset including the misdated AY269825 taxon than the RdRp dataset, which produced a more trustworthy substitution rate (r = 0.76 compared to r = 0.70). The decision to include or exclude taxa based on residuals from a best-fitting line is largely subjective, as there are no guidelines for how common large residuals are in tip-dated viral datasets. In fact, one of the AY269825-containing RHDV datasets had been subjected to this control prior to rate analysis, and the authors did not reject it as an outlier [12]. Finally, root-to-tip regression provides no insight into the magnitude of effect of any taxon on evolutionary estimates. The jackknife controls proposed here focus on detecting taxa that have had a disproportionate effect on the BEAST results, and, in the case of RHDV, offered strong quantitative evidence against including AY269825.",

Even while the RdRp dataset did not have as strong a temporal signal (Additional file 3), probably due to the lower number of taxa, it still produced a significantly more accurate substitution rate estimate than datasets with two to three times as many taxa that included just one misdated taxon (Table 1). Further, the estimated substitution rate from our VP60 RHDV + RCV dataset was nearly identical to that from another dataset which contained just 29 taxa (27 RHDV, 1 RCV, did not contain AY269825), including one distantly related European brown hare syndrome virus taxon as an outgroup [13]. This pattern of different sized datasets producing very similar substitution rates is not unique to RHDV. For example, two BEAST analyses of Dengue virus type 2 from datasets of 115 taxa and 67 taxa yielded nearly identical substitution rates [58,59]. Further, in the case of Human parechovirus, three BEAST analyses of three different genomic regions based on datasets with a range of 29\u2013199 taxa also produced nearly identical substitution rates [55,60].",

These results support favoring data sets with fewer taxa with verifiable dates of isolation over larger data sets with less quality control: additional good data do not swamp out the effects of one badly dated taxon. When researchers are including any ambiguously dated taxa, or when they want to be certain about the effects of each taxon on the rate analysis, jackknife controls provide a clear way to see these effects. As many sequences are added to GenBank without easily accessible papers describing in detail the isolation, passaging and sequencing of each isolate, it is necessary to verify if one or more of the sequences is having a disproportionate influence on the results. We propose n-1 jackknifing as one method for researchers using tip-calibrated analyses in BEAST to ensure that a small number of taxa are not spoiling their estimates.",

Each of these jackknifed datasets was run in BEAST, as described above, with the same best-fitting priors from the full dataset. In a parallel analysis, the 31 RdRp taxa were jackknifed into 30 independent subsets of 15 taxa each (exact taxa used for jackknife analyses available in Additional file 7). These smaller datasets were run until all parameters had stable ESS values (>200). Similarity between the mean estimated rates was determined visually by plotting the mean and 95% HPDs and by using the data to generate violin plots (violinmplot package in R [69,70]).",
