Ross 708 broiler hatching eggs (3,900) were either i.o.-vaccinated at 18 d of incubation or chicks from eggs that were not i.o.-vaccinated were s.c.-vaccinated at hatch.

Sixteen birds were initially assigned to each of 15 replicate floor pens belonging to each of the moa and pht combination groups and were grown out through 48 doa. At 48 doa, 6 birds were randomly selected from each replicate pen and were weighed and fasted for 16 h before being processed. At 49 doa, whole carcass, fat pad, breast muscle, and tenders muscles weights were recorded. Whole carcass weight as a percentage of live BW, and fat pad, breast muscle, and tenders muscles weights as percentages of both live and whole carcass weights were calculated. Upon subjection of the data to a 2 \u00d7 2 factorial analysis, only a main effect due to moa was observed for tenders muscles weight as a percentage of live and whole carcass weights. Tenders muscles weight as a percentage of both live (P \u2264 0.010) and whole carcass (P \u2264 0.004) weight was higher in birds hatched from eggs that received i.o. rather than s.c. vaccinations. In conclusion, in comparison to s.c. vaccination, i.o. vaccination increased relative tenders weight yield, whether or not broilers were held for 4 or 18 h prior to placement. Therefore, with regard to broiler processing yield, i.o. and s.c. vaccinations were safe for the administration of the MD vaccine, with i.o. vaccination displaying a slight potential advantage.",

However, upon determining the effects of in ovo (i.o.) and s.c. injections on hatchability, mortality, feed consumption and conversion, processing live BW, and condemnations, Gildersleeve et al. (1993) surmised that administration of the MD vaccine by i.o. injection results in reduced settlement costs and is safe and efficacious. Accordingly, 98 to 99% of broilers in the US poultry industry are currently vaccinated for MD by i.o. injection (Johnston et al., 1997; Jochemsen and Jeurissen, 2002) . Peebles et al. (2016) also examined the effects of the moa of the MD vaccine in a study which served as a counterpart to the present one. In that report, it was likewise shown that in comparison to non-injected controls, i.o. injection did not have a differential effect on fertile egg hatchability or total and yolk-free BW at hatch. Also, in comparison to s.c. injection, i.o. injection did not have a significantly different effect on 3944 total and yolk-free BW, body length, or body mass index at placement, or on total and yolk-free BW at 7 d post-hatch. However, in comparison to non-injected controls, higher body lengths and lower body mass indices resulted in the hatchlings that had received i.o. injections. In a later companion report, Peebles et al. (2017) additionally noted that the 14 to 28 d of age (doa) feed consumption and 14 to 21 doa BW gain of birds belonging to the i.o. treatment group was greater in comparison to those belonging to the s.c. treatment group.",

Delayed pht has also been associated with dehydration and an inadequate supply of energy (Vieira and Moran, 1999b) . Franco et al. (2006) showed that as the pht of broiler chicks was increased in 12 h intervals up to 48 h, that there was a linear reduction in their live BW and feed intake. Vieira and Moran (1999a) have noted that a reduction in the BW gain of broilers subjected to a 24 h pht was sustained through market age (49 doa), and it has been advocated that the inability of rats to attain normal BW is associated with a depression in their muscle development (Elliott et al., 1943) . In the study by Peebles et al. (2016) , it was also reported that prolonging pht by 14 h was unfavorable to the early chick quality of Ross 708 broilers. A decrease in BW at 7 doa also resulted by extending pht an additional 14 h. Furthermore, in the later companion report by Peebles et al. (2017) , it was shown that in response to an increase in pht from 4 to 18 h, a decrease in posthatch BW gain through 35 doa was associated with a reduction in feed consumption through 28 doa.",

            "text": "In spite of the fact that moa was shown by Peebles et al. (2017) to have no significant effect on mean BW at each of the weekly age periods, there were significant integrated responses of feed consumption and BW gain to moa in the various age intervals examined. The 14 to 28 d feed consumption and 14 to 21 d BW gain of s.c.-vaccinated birds was lower than that of i.o.vaccinated birds. Previous reports directly comparing effects of i.o. and s.c. administration of the MD vaccine on broiler processing yield are lacking in the literature. In the current study, relative tenders muscles weight was greater at 49 doa in the birds that received i.o injections in comparison to those that received s.c. injections. This may be related to the increased feed consumption and BW gain noted in those birds between 14 and 28 doa by Peebles et al. (2017) . The noted isolated effect on the tenders muscle group, exclusive of the other processing variables examined, is difficult to explain. However, it is noteworthy that Peebles et al. (2014) also showed that the incubational characteristics of Ross 708 broiler hatching eggs was associated with relative tenders muscle yield at 49 d post-hatch. These results nevertheless suggest that although i.o. vaccination displays some potential advantage over s.c. injection of the MD vaccine, these moa basically have no differential effects on the processing yield of Ross 708 broilers. Peebles et al. (2016) also reported that although chick body length, relative yolk-free BW, and yolk moisture content at placement were increased by an increase in pht from 4 to 18 h, the delay in pht caused total absolute BW, body mass index, absolute and relative yolk sac weight, and yolk-free body moisture content at placement, and BW at 7 doa, to be decreased. Oliveira et al. (2015) reported that a 24 h pht including feed and water restriction caused Ross 708 broilers to experience a lower feed intake and BW gain, and a higher feed conversion ratio through 21 doa post-hatch in comparison to those provided immediate access to water and feed. Peebles et al. (2017) further showed that an increase in pht from 4 to 18 h significantly reduced the BW of the Ross 708 broilers at placement (d 0) as well as on d 7, 14, 21, and 35, and further noted that there were likewise significant integrated responses of feed consump-tion and BW gain to pht in the various post-hatch age intervals examined. The increase in pht from 4 to 18 h decreased feed consumption through 28 d post-hatch and BW gain through 35 d post-hatch. Peebles et al. (2017) concluded that a pht without available food and water for 18 h or more can result in significant reductions in broiler post-hatch BW, and suggested that the basis for the relationship between reduced feed intake and growth suppression is a reduction in nutrient availability. Vieira and Moran (1999b) have summarized that depressed growth as the result of a delayed pht and early nutrient inadequacies is associated with decreased skeletal muscle growth which extends to marketing age, thereby leading to reduced broiler meat yield. Joseph and Moran (2005) reported that prolonging the pht of male and female Ross 308 broilers in the hatcher from 3 to 15 h exerted no major effects on their subsequent grow-out performance or their carcass qualities and breast meat yields. However, a 24 h pht without access to feed and water has been reported to eventually reduce the slaughter carcass weight and percentage of grade A carcasses of male Ross 308 broilers (Vieira and Moran, 1999a) . The results of this current study are similar to those of Joseph and Moran (2005) . Despite noted adverse effects on broiler performance through 35 doa post-hatch, a delay of up to 18 h was observed to have no negative impact on processing yield. Conversely, increasing the delay up to 24 h pht may be deleterious to processing yield and carcass quality. It is suggested that such a delay would negatively impact the yield in Ross 708 broilers, as has been shown by Vieira and Moran (1999a) for Ross 308 broilers. Further research would be needed to confirm this suggestion.",

The corresponding results of this study and that of Peebles et al. (2014) , concerning tenders muscle yield at 49 d post-hatch, also confirm that the early subjection of broilers to various physiological challenges can ultimately affect processing yield. In addition, there were no interactive effects observed between moa of the MD vaccine and pht. Although prolonging pht by 14 h reduced BW gain through 35 d in association with the reduction in feed consumption through 28 d, because there was no interaction between moa and pht for any of the processing yield variables examined, it may also be concluded that an increase in pht from 4 to 18 h does not exacerbate the effect of administering the MD vaccine to Ross 708 broilers by either i.o. or s.c. injection. In light of the results of the current investigation, effects of the i.o. administration of vaccines for other viral diseases of major concern to poultry producers including avian influenza, Newcastle disease, and coronaviruses on subsequent processing yield deserve further investigation.",
