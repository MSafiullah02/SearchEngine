            "text": "Pulmonary hypertension (PHTN) is a commonly encountered problem in neonatal intensive care units (NICU) [1, 2]. Right heart catheterization (RHC) remains the gold standard to diagnose PHTN. However, cardiac catheterization is an invasive procedure and carries substantial risk of complications [3\u20136]. In clinical practice, a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) is regularly ordered to screen for PHTN. Nevertheless, conventional TTE methods to screen for PHTN and assess systolic pulmonary artery pressure (SPAP) rely on the presence of sufficient tricuspid regurgitation (TR) or the presence of an anatomical cardiac defect (e.g., ventricular septal defect (VSD) and/or patent ductus arteriosus (PDA)). Therefore, without these factors, TTE assessment of SPAP in infants cannot be performed [7\u201312]. Pulmonary artery acceleration time (PAAT) is a promising alternative tool for non-invasive estimation of SPAP. It is easy to obtain and doesn\u2019t require presence of TR or an anatomical cardiac defect. PAAT correlates inversely with the SPAP, mean pulmonary artery pressure and calculated pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR). Moreover, in the adult literature, PAAT-based equations have been created to estimate pulmonary artery pressure [11, 13, 14]. To our knowledge, only one previous study performed in children utilized PAAT to estimate SPAP by creating an equation derived from linear regression analysis [15]. No such equations have been purposed to assess SPAP exclusively in neonates and young infants who are historically at higher risk of developing cardiac catheterization related complications (CCRC) [6].",

PAAT was obtained by placing the cursor in the center of the distal right ventricular outflow tract just below the pulmonary valve annulus. This position reduces the contamination of the doppler signal by the PDA flow at the MPA. In order to produce better flow characteristics and improve measurement accuracy, pulsed wave sweep speed was set on the max and the gain was adjusted to produce a clean uniform Doppler profile. Then, PAAT was measured from the resulting envelope (Fig. 1).",

In our practice, systemic blood pressure (BP) is usually checked at the time of performing TTE, and BP measurement results and type of measurement (e.g., invasive versus non-invasive) are recorded. We used recorded blood pressure to estimate systolic pulmonary artery pressure when a good PDA and/or VSD Doppler were recorded. To further test the strength of PAAT with the different TTE methods used to estimate SPAP, we divided patients into three groups. Group 1: systolic pulmonary artery pressure estimated through maximum velocity of tricuspid valve regurgitation (TRVmax), group II: SPAP estimated based on the peak gradient across the VSD, and group III: SPAP estimated based on the peak gradient across the PDA. To investigate whether adjusting to heart rate (HR) would increase the strength of correlations, we divided PAAT by the square root of the RR interval [16]. Because pulmonary pressure and systemic artery pressure are dynamic and consistently change, TTEs performed in the same patient at more than 24 h interval were included.",
