We detail how 241 these greenspace components could be linked to pain outcomes via various Phytoncides may also influence the human immune system, particularly natural killer 414 cell function. In vitro studies have shown that phytoncides can enhance human 415 natural killer cell function (Li et al., 2006) . Natural killer cell function was enhanced 416 for people walking in forests, but not in cities, and importantly phytoncides were only 417 detected in the forest and not in the city (Li et al., 2008) . This study did not, however, 418 account for the potential impact of other forest exposures (e.g. environmental 419 microbiome) that may have influenced the relationship. Nonetheless, greenspace 420 exposure appears to improve natural killer cell activity, and natural killer cells have 421 recently been proposed as a treatment for some types of pain (Davies et al., 2019) . forces of water, sunlight, atmospheric radiant or cosmic rays, and natural and 441 artificial corona discharge (Jiang et al., 2018) .

(2018) investigated the association 196 between the degree of \"vegetation cover greenness\" and land use greenness within 197 the participants' residential 'circuit', and whether the participant reported pain and/or 198 stiffness in their muscles/joints in the last four weeks in three or more (of six) body 199 regions (although the body regions were not listed). No association between 200 greenspace and pain for males was observed, but for females the prevalence of 201 pain/stiffness was higher in those living in areas with more vegetation cover 202 greenness and land use greenness(Ihlebaek et al., 2018). This unexpected finding 203 should be interpreted with caution given a number of limitations. Firstly, the outcome 204 measures employed were not tested for validity and reliability, and secondly there 205 was no differentiation between pain and stiffness.206 207 In both studies (Ihlebaek et al., 2018; Maas et al., 2009), the use of residential 208 proximity to greenspace does not necessarily provide an accurate measure of a 209 resident's greenspace exposure, owing to individual differences in exposure to 210 greenspace. 211 212 We do however have additional corroborative evidence suggesting that a 213 relationship is likely, and that further research in the area is worthwhile. There is 214 evidence for example that forest therapy (Han et al., 2016; Kang et al., 2015), 215 exercise in green areas (Huber et al., 2019) (not to be confused with 'green 216 prescriptions' that refer to written advice to a patient regarding physical activity made 217 by a health professional; (New Zealand Ministry of Health, 2016), and involvement in 218 horticultural therapy (Kim et al., 2006; Verra et al., 2012) and conservation (Moore et 219 al., 2007) are associated with better pain outcomes. However, these studies have 220 not been designed with appropriate controls to ascertain whether greenspace 221 exposure itself led to the benefits or whether these benefits could be due to other 222 aspects, such as physical activity and/or social interaction. Furthermore, all used 223 lower level study designs (National Health and Medical Research Council, 2009; 224 Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine, 2011) (e.g. observational studies), and 225 some studies of forest therapy and green exercise actually also included 226 interventions (e.g. walking/hiking (Han et al., 2016; Huber et al., 2019; Kang et al., 227 2015), being residential (Han et al., 2016; Huber et al., 2019), music therapy (Han et 228 al., 2016) which were not provided to the comparison groups. As it stands, there is 229 therefore some suggestion that greenspace exposure may assist in pain 230 management, however the evidence to date is insufficient to determine whether the 231 benefits are due to greenspace exposure per se. 232 233",

Not 250 shown are additional potential pathways joining different ecophysiological linkage 251 mechanisms. 252 253 Environmental microbiomes 254The 'old friends' hypothesis proposes that humans evolved alongside a diverse suite 255 of environmental microbiota (collectively known as 'microbiomes'), and that co-256 evolved symbiotic relationships developed(Rook et al., 2004). This co-evolution 257 underpins our argument that exposure to greenspace (with its microbiome) may 258 positively influence pain outcomes. It has recently been demonstrated that direct soil 259 contact changes the human skin microbiome(Gr\u00f6nroos et al., 2019), and that 260 exposure to different environments (and their respective microbiomes) changes the 261 human nasal and skin microbiome(Lai et al., 2017). Importantly, the latter study was 262 conducted indoors and is therefore not susceptible to some of the potential 263 confounding exposures present outdoors (e.g. direct plant/soil/animal interactions, 264 exposure to sunlight and phytoncides) that may also influence the human 265 microbiome (as discussed below). The influence of the environmental microbiome on 266 the human gut microbiome is not currently well understood(Blum et  al., 2019; 267 Tasnim et al., 2017), however animal studies indicate such an influence (Blum et al., 268 2019), even via indirect exposure to soil via the aerobiome only (Liddicoat et al.microbiome-gut-brain axis refers to the bidirectional communication between the 272 gut microbiome, the gut and the brain, mediated by neurotransmitters, bacterial 273 metabolites, cytokines, hormones and neural communication (Kelly et al., 2015; 274 Mayer et al., 2014). Interest in the microbiome-gut-brain axis has increased 275 dramatically since 2009, with over 500 papers published on the topic in 2018 alone 276 (Zyoud et al., 2019). However, pain as an outcome has been relatively under-277 investigated, with studies predominantly focusing on visceral pain (Guo et al., 2019; 278 Rea et al., 2019). The relationship between the human microbiome and pain 279 outcomes has recently been comprehensively reviewed (Guo et al., 2019; Rea et al., 280 2019), hence we provide only a summary of the current evidence base, with 281 interested readers referred to Guo et al. (2019) and Rea et al. (2019) for further 282 detail. 283 284 Associations between the human microbiome and a range of painful conditions have 285 been reported. These conditions include endometriosis (Leonardi et al., 2019), 286 fibromyalgia (Malatji et al., 2017), myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue 287 syndrome (Nagy-Szakal et al., 2017), interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome 288 (Nickel et al., 2019), chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (Shoskes et al., 289 2016), dermatitis (Gulliver et al., 2018), and inflammatory bowel disease (Knights et 290 al., 2013). Furthermore, there is emerging experimental evidence that changing the 291 gut microbiome through probiotics (Lactobacillus casei Shirota (Lei et al., 2017), L. 292 gasseri OLL2809 (Itoh et al., 2011), and combined L. acidophilus, L. plantarum, L. 293 fermentum and L. gasseri (Khodaverdi et al., 2019) reduces pain in people with knee 294 osteoarthritis (Lei et al., 2017), and endometriosis (Itoh et al., 2011; Khodaverdi et 295 al., 2019). Recently, faecal microbiota transplants have also been shown to reduce 296 pain in those with fibromyalgia (Thurm et al., 2017) and Clostridium difficile infection 297 (Alukal et al., 2019). Although these positive results could be due either to changes 298 in the disease state or to changes in pain processing, they nonetheless suggest that 299 exposure to greenspace -and their associated environmental microbiomes -may 300 lead to reductions in pain, via changes in the human microbiome. 301 302 A recent study by Shiro et al. (2017) reported an association between stool 303 consistency (a proxy measure of the gut microbiome) and pain intensity (initiated by 304 mechanical stimulation of the inter-digital space between the second and third, and 305 the fourth-fifth digits of the right hand). This study provides some evidence of the 306 potential role of gut microbiome on pain perception, although the causal mechanisms 307 are still hypothetical. 308 309 As outlined above, the gut microbiome can influence the brain via various 310 microbially-mediated mechanisms, and those related to chronic pain have recently 311 been reviewed elsewhere (Guo et al., 2019). Microbiota-derived mediators may 312 decrease pain perception via peripheral and central mechanisms. For peripheral 313 mechanisms, the mediators that reduce hypersensitivity include proteases, kynurenic 314 acid, and GABA (Guo et al., 2019). Short-chain fatty acids regulate leucocyte 315 functions, and one of these short-chain fatty acids, butyrate, reduces pain associated 316 with nerve injury by inhibiting histone deacetylase (Guo et al., 2019). Bile acids are 317 another type of mediator, that may reduce pain by activating release of endogenous 318 opioids from macrophages (Guo et al., 2019). The bacteria that could be implicated 319 in the production of the abovementioned mediators include L. rhamnosus 320 (Pokusaeva et al., 2017; Siragusa et al., 2007), L. brevis (Barrett et al., 2012), L. 321 buchneri (Cho et al., 2007), L. paracasei (Komatsuzaki et al., 2005), L. plantarum 322 (Siragusa et al., 2007), L. delbruekii subsp. bulgaricus (Siragusa et al., 2007), 323 Monascus purpureus (Su et al., 2003), Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus 324 (Yang et al., 2008), Clostridium butyricum (Liu et al., 2015; Rivi\u00e8re et al., 2016), 325 Coprococcus eutactus (Rivi\u00e8re et al., 2016), C. comes (Rivi\u00e8re et al., 2016), 326 Bifidobacterium spp. (Rivi\u00e8re et al., 2016), B. dentium (Barrett et al., 2012; 327 Pokusaeva et al., 2017), B. infantis (Barrett et al., 2012), B. adolescentis (Barrett et 328 al., 2012), Bacteroides fragilis (Strandwitz et al., 2019), Parabacteroides spp. 329 (Strandwitz et al., 2019), Faecalibacterium prausnitzii (Rivi\u00e8re et al., 2016), 330 Eubacterium hallii (Rivi\u00e8re et al., 2016), E. rectale (Rivi\u00e8re et al., 2016), 331 Anaerostripes butyraticus (Rivi\u00e8re et al., 2016), A. caccae (Rivi\u00e8re et al., 2016), A. 332 hadrus (Rivi\u00e8re et al., 2016), Butyricicoccus pullicaecorum (Rivi\u00e8re et al., 2016), 333 Roseburia faecis (Rivi\u00e8re et al., 2016), R. inulinivorans (Rivi\u00e8re et al., 2016), R. 334 intestinalis (Rivi\u00e8re et al., 2016), R. hominis (Rivi\u00e8re et al., 2016), and Escherichia 335 spp. (Strandwitz et al., 2019) again supporting a potential association between gut 336 microbiome and pain outcomes. 337 338 For central mechanisms, central sensitisation may be the result of glial activation 339 which ultimately leads to decreased GABAergic synaptic neurotransmission and/or 340 elevated glutamatergic synaptic neurotransmission, and the gut microbiome plays a 341 role in microglial function, maturation and morphology (Guo et al., 2019). There is 342 however no direct evidence, to our knowledge, linking the gut microbiome to central 343 sensitisation, although GABA-producing bacteria could theoretically be implicated. 344 345 In addition to the abovementioned mechanisms linking the human microbiome and 346 pain outcomes, the human microbiome influences mental health outcomes. 347 Probiotics (e.g. Lactobaccilis spp., Bacillus spp., Clostridium spp., Bifidobacterium 348 spp.) can reduce anxiety (Liu et al., 2019) and depression (Liu et al., 2019; Vaghef-349 Mehrabany et al., 2019), and gut microbiome regulation (e.g. probiotics, dietary 350 changes) can reduce anxiety (Yang et al., 2019). There is also an association 351 between gut microbiome and sleep (Smith et al., 2019). Experimental sleep 352 deprivation has been shown to influence the gut microbiome (Benedict et al., 2016; 353 Poroyko et al., 2016), however to our knowledge no study has investigated whether 354 changes to the microbiome influence sleep outcomes. By improving mental health 355 and potentially sleep, due to the changes in gut microbiome, greenspace exposure 356 may improve pain outcomes. 357 358 It has recently been demonstrated in a mouse study that a diverse gut microbiome is 359 required for fear extinction learning to occur (Chu et al., 2019), which may have 360 implications for chronic pain. There is some evidence to suggest that people with 361 chronic pain have reduced differential learning (Harvie et al., 2017), and that fear-362 avoidance beliefs (Drake et al., 2018; Hruschak and Cochran, 2018; Jayakumar et 363 al., 2018; Morton et al., 2019) are associated with chronic pain. Chu et al.'s (2019) 364 suggested that interventions to reduce fear-avoidance (e.g. graded exposure) may 365 have had limited success in those with lower gut microbiome diversity. These 366 findings may also have implications for changing other cognitive elements of the pain 367 experience such as pain beliefs, expectations regarding pain and recovery. 368 369 Although the association between environmental microbiome and pain outcomes has 370 not been investigated, we suggest that such an association is likely to exist owing to 371 the influence of environmental microbiomes on human microbiomes, and the 372 existence of multiple potential pathways linking the human microbiome and pain 373 outcomes. 374 375 Sights and sounds of nature 376 The biophilia hypothesis -where humans have an innate and natural affiliation with 377 nature (Wilson, 1986) -has traditionally been central to the proposed link between 378 greenspace exposure and health outcomes, and relates to exposure to the sights 379 and sounds of nature. Listening to pleasant nature sounds during elective 380 Caesarean section has been shown to reduce post-operative pain severity 381 (Farzaneh et al., 2019), and also resulted in lower pain for those undergoing 382 mechanical ventilation (Saadatmand et al., 2015). Combined natural sounds and 383 sights have resulted in lower pain severity compared with both city sounds and 384 sights and with a control during bone marrow aspirate and biopsy (Lechtzin et al., 385 2010). Vincent et al. (2010) demonstrated differences in the effect of viewing an 386 array of natural scenery on experimental pain sensation. They found that the 387 combined prospect/refuge scenery resulted in lower pain sensation than prospect, 388 refuge and hazard scenery and the control (a black screen). Listening to pleasant 389 nature sounds has also been reported to improve sleep (Nasari et al., 2018), while a 390 virtual nature experience reduced stress (Liszio et al., 2018), which may also lead to 391 a reduction in pain. Greenspace exposure could therefore result in a reduction in 392 pain due to exposure to natural sights and sounds. 393 394 Phytoncides 395The antimicrobial volatile organic compounds emitted as a defence mechanism by 396 plants are called phytoncides, and they permeate the air particularly in or near 397 greenspace(Franco et al., 2017). To our knowledge no study has investigated the 398 relationship between phytoncides and pain in humans, however an analgesic effect 399 has been reported for mice(Cheng et al., 2009).400 401 Given their antimicrobial properties (Franco et al., 2017), phytoncides may also 402 influence the microbiome. To our knowledge, the impact of phytoncides exposure on 403 the microbiome has not been examined, however the effect of dietary phytoncide 404 supplements on gut Lactobacillus spp. and Escherichia coli counts has (Kim et al., 405 2018a; Li et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2012). These studies of livestock found that 406 dietary phytoncides supplements reported mixed results, with one study reporting no 407 change (Zhang et al., 2018), and others reporting a significantly higher Lactobacillus 408 spp. counts (Kim et al., 2018a; Li et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2012) and lower 409 Escherichia coli counts (Kim et al., 2018a; Li et al., 2015) with the supplements. 410 These alternations to the gut microbiome may influence pain perception, due to the 411 mechanisms outlined above. 412 413",

There was a significant reduction in trait-anxiety, depression, confusion 431 and fatigue when the forest could be viewed, but not when the view was occluded, 432 however there were no significant differences in the outcomes between the two 433 exposures post-exposure (Horiuchi et al., 2014). Horiuchi et al.(2014) indicated that 434 phytoncides are unlikely to be the sole reason for changes in human health 435 outcomes related to greenspace exposure, but supported the notion that greenspace 436 exposure may improve pain outcomes. 437 438 Negative air ions 439 Negative air ions are generated by plants (see Jiang et al.

            "text": "446 These effects include decreased cyclic nucleotides, lower dopamine, activation of 447 natural killer cells, and improved mental health (Jiang et al., 2018), all of which may 448 reduce pain, including chronic pain (Davies et al., 2019; Drake et al., 2018; Hruschak 449 and Cochran, 2018; Jayakumar et al., 2018; Li et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2018; Taylor et 450 al., 2016). 451 452 Negative air ions have also been shown to kill or reduce a range of microbes, 453 including Serratia marcescens, Staphylococcus albus, S. aureus, S. epidermidis, 454 Pseudomonas veronii, P. fluorescens, Salmonella Enteritidis, Candida albicans, 455 Escherichia coli, and Penicillum notatum, and have been shown to prevent 456 Acinetobacter infections (Jiang et al., 2018). These antimicrobial effects indicate that 457 negative air ions have the potential to alter the human microbiome, which may 458 therefore influence pain outcomes. 459 460 Sunlight exposure 461Sunlight exposure is the first of three generic factors that we propose may link 462 greenspace exposure to pain outcomes. Depending on the weather, geographic 463 location, canopy cover and time of day, spending time in greenspace is likely to lead 464 to sunlight exposure. Sunlight exposure is perhaps most commonly associated with 465 vitamin D production, but exposure to sunlight also leads to the production of beta-466 endorphin (an endogenous opioid peptide), melatonin, and nitric oxide (a 467 vasodilator), as well as the release of carbon monoxide from haemoglobin (a 468 vasodilator), and expression of the proopiomelanocortin gene (which results in the 469 production of beta-endorphin and cortisol)(Holick, 2016).470 471 Observational studies have identified an association between vitamin D levels and 472 arthritis, muscle pain, chronic widespread pain (Wu et al., 2018), and low back pain 473 (Zadro et al., 2017); however, studies investigating the impact of vitamin D 474 supplementation on pain outcomes have generally shown that vitamin D 475 supplementation is no better than placebo for people with lower back pain (Zadro et 476 al., 2018) and non-specific musculoskeletal disorders (Gaikwad et al., 2017). 477 However, there is some evidence of vitamin D lowering pain intensity for those with 478 chronic widespread pain (Yong et al., 2017). The discrepancy between the 479 observational and experimental evidence regarding the relationship vitamin D and 480 pain may be the result of vitamin D acting as a proxy-measure of sunlight exposure. 481 Sunlight exposure could lead to a change in pain through non-vitamin D pathways, 482 including the release of beta-endorphins (Holick, 2016) and melatonin (Zhu et al., 483 2017), or indeed changes in the microbiome (Waterhouse et al., 2019). Furthermore, 484 sunlight exposure (D\u00fczg\u00fcn and Durmaz Akyol, 2017) and vitamin D supplementation 485 (Jamilian et al., 2019) have led to improved sleep including for people with chronic 486 pain specifically (Huang et al., 2013). Vitamin D supplementation has also resulted in 487 reduced inflammation (Jamilian et al., 2019) and improvements in depression 488 (Jamilian et al., 2019), which may in turn contribute to improved pain outcomes. 489 490 Physical activity 491 Exposure to greenspace reportedly facilitates physical activity (Keskinen et al., 492 2018); the second generic factor in our review. Physical activity is commonly 493 prescribed by health professionals, particularly for patients in pain. Evidence in 494 support of physical activity for reducing the prevalence and impact of pain include 495 findings of physical activity being associated with a lower incidence of neck pain 496 (Kim et al., 2018b), and lower prevalence of lower back pain (Alzahrani et al., 497 2019b), including frequent and chronic lower back pain (Shiri and Falah-Hassani, 498 2017). Furthermore, interventions to increase incidental physical activity lead to 499 improved lower back pain-related disability (Alzahrani et al., 2019a). For those with 500 musculoskeletal conditions in particular, physical activity may decrease nociception 501 by improving the underlying musculoskeletal condition. Exercise reduces 502 inflammation (Stigger et al., 2019; Zheng et al., 2019) and stress (Bischoff et al., 503 2019; Rodriguez-Ayllon et al., 2019), improves sleep (Banno et al., 2018; Kreutz et 504 al., 2019; Lederman et al., 2019; Lowe et al., 2019; Stutz et al., 2019) and mental 505 health (B\u00e9land et al., 2019; McDowell et al., 2019; Morres et al., 2019; Nakamura et 506 al., 2019; Rodriguez-Ayllon et al., 2019), and changes the human microbiome 507 (Mailing et al., 2019). The health improvements associated with exercise may also 508 influence pain perception and the risk of transitioning from acute to chronic pain. 509 Thus, physical activity, particularly when facilitated by greenspace exposure, is likely 510 to also contribute to a reduction in the global burden of pain. 511 512 Social integration 513 Although social integration is not specific to greenspace, greenspace exposure is 514 associated with a range of social benefits and has been identified as a facilitator of 515 social integration and cohesion (Jennings and Bamkole, 2019), and would therefore 516 be expected to improve social support. Social support has been associated with pain 517 perception (Che et al., 2018b), including experimental pain (Che et al., 2018a), while 518 low levels of social support are associated with a higher risk of transitioning from 519 acute to chronic pain (Fregoso et al., 2019). In addition, higher levels of social 520 support and integration are associated with lower inflammation (Uchino et al., 2018), 521 better sleep (Kent de Grey et al., 2018), and better mental health (Tengku Moud et 522 al., 2019) which may all in turn influence pain perception. Of note, sleep may also 523 influence the gut microbiome (Benedict et al., 2016; Poroyko et al., 2016) and thus 524",

It can take years for patients to gain 547 access to these services (Anderson, 2016), during which time their nervous systems 548 change and the burden of their pain increases. The caveat to this is, however, that 549 appropriate greenspaces must be accessible to those who require them. Several550 general barriers to such greenspace access have been suggested, and include a 551 lack of amenities (Cronin-de-Chavez et al., 2019; Sefcik et al., 2019), safety 552 concerns (Boyd et al., 2018; Cronin-de-Chavez et al., 2019; Sefcik et al., 2019; 553 Selby et al., 2019), proximity to greenspace (Selby et al., 2019), and issues with 554 transport (Boyd et al., 2018; Cronin-de-Chavez et al., 2019; Fretwell and Greig, 555 2019; Sefcik et al., 2019). Perhaps more importantly, a lack of interest (Boyd et al., 556 2018; Fretwell and Greig, 2019) and time (Boyd et al., 2018; Fretwell and Greig, 557 2019; Holt et al., 2019; Selby et al., 2019), and debilitating health conditions (Boyd et 558 al., 2018; Cronin-de-Chavez et al., 2019; Fretwell and Greig, 2019; Sefcik et al., 559 2019) have also been identified as barriers.

Despite this, the 170 relationship between greenspace and pain outcomes or painful conditions (e.g. 171 musculoskeletal disorders) have not been adequately investigated (Twohig-Bennett 172 To our knowledge, only two studies (Ihlebaek et al., 2018; Maas et al., 2009) have 175 investigated the possible association between greenspace exposure and pain 176 outcomes, with mixed findings. Maas et al. (2009) investigated the relationship 177 between the percentage of greenspace in circles with 1 or 3 kilometre radii around 178 the participants' places of residence, and health conditions reported in general 179 practice notes in the 12 months prior.

Of these musculoskeletal conditions, there was a 183 significant negative association between the percentage of greenspace in the 1 km 184 radius circle and the number of neck/back complaints, severe back complaints, 185 severe neck/back complaints, severe elbow/wrist/hand complaints (Maas et al., 186 2009).
