Second, the provision of nonlinear irregular pores determines the course of airfl ow and causes an increase in inertial force that traps the microorganisms within the mesh. The pore size can allow interception of organisms larger than 1 m m and thanks to the nonlinear arrangement of the pores increases their ability to fi lter microorganisms larger than 0.5 m m. This principle has the limitation that the mesh of tiny pores has high resistance to airfl ow. 2. The electrostatic fi lter is produced by the fi bers of the internal components of the fi lter being subjected to an electric fi eld. Bacteria and viruses also have a surface electric charge, either positive or negative, and remain trapped in the dipole electric fi elds of the fi lter screen. 3. The bactericidal fi lter is made by impregnating the fi lter material with bactericidal agents. Their action allows the growth of bacteria within the fi lter. For this purpose, antiseptic substances such as chlorhexidine acetate have been used. They are not recommended because they can dissolve in the condensate circuit and reach the tracheobronchial tract.",

The antimicrobial fi lters cause an increase in expiratory fl ow resistance, which can promote air trapping within the patient's lungs. Pulmonary air trapping can have different implications: (a) hemodynamic deterioration, (b) risk of pneumothorax and (c) impaired gas exchange. Pulmonary air trapping leads to increased intrathoracic pressure, which causes the venous return, and therefore can decrease cardiac output and blood pressure. One of the mechanisms of the production of pneumothorax is increased intrathoracic pressure, and this increase appears with air trapping. Moreover, this can also cause air trapping impaired gas exchange because of changes in ventilation/perfusion of the lung, and therefore lead to the development of hypoxemia and/or hypercapnia. This effect could appear when the fi lter is interposed between the \"Y\" part and the endotracheal tube or is located in the expiratory limb (immediately before the expiratory valve of the respirator). 2. Respiratory fi lters produce an increase in inspiratory fl ow resistance, which may have implications for the patient and the respirator. This increase in inspiratory fl ow resistance increases the work of breathing of the patient to initiate inspiration and may hinder weaning from mechanical ventilation. Besides, this increase in inspiratory fl ow resistance also increases the work of breathing for inspiration, and positive pressure can damage the mechanism of the respirator. This effect can appear when the fi lter is interposed between the \"Y\" part and the endotracheal tube or is located in the inspiratory limb (immediately after the ventilator inspiratory valve). 3. The bacterial fi lters generate an increase in dead space because the air space does not participate in gas exchange and can lead to hypoventilation and the development of hypoxemia and/or hypercapnia. This effect can appear when the fi lter is interposed between the \"Y\" part and the endotracheal tube.",

In some studies [ 5, 6 ] of anesthetized patients with and without respiratory infection, samples were taken from several sites of the anesthesia machine and breathing circuits before and after anesthesia, and no differences were found in the contamination of the anesthesia machine and breathing circuits in either patient group. Other studies [6] [7] [8] [9] have simulated the contamination of an anesthesia machine by intentional contamination of the expiratory limb of the breathing circuit with an inoculum of an organism, after the sterilization of the anesthesia machine and the entire respiratory circuit, and with continued contamination of the anesthesia machine and breathing circuit inspiratory limb. The authors suggest that the absence of contamination of the anesthesia machine and breathing circuit inspiratory limb is because microorganisms cannot live in the breathing circuits, because the circulating gas is cold and dry (characteristic of medicinal gases), which hinders the survival of microorganisms.",

This decrease in exogenous respiratory infection processes could be due to the fact that microbial fi lters in respiratory circuits could reduce the risk of exogenous microorganisms reaching the patient antegradely from the inspiratory valve of the respirator or retrogradely from the exhalation valve of the respirator.",
