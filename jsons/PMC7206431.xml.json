Increased workload, physical exhaustion, inadequate personal equipment, nosocomial transmission, and the need to make ethically difficult decisions on the rationing of care may have dramatic effects on their physical and mental well-being. Their resilience can be further compromised by isolation and loss of social support, risk or infections of friends and relatives as well as drastic, often unsettling changes in the ways of working. HCWs are, therefore, especially vulnerable to mental health problems, including fear, anxiety, depression and insomnia (Lung et al., 2009, Wu et al., 000).",

Due to the fact, that studies with prevalence close to 0 or 1 have affected variance which may lead to a large weight of the study in the meta-analysis, the proportions were transformed using the double arcsine method and then back-transformed for ease of interpretation (Barendregt et al., 2013). Due to the different patient populations, regions, and assessment methods across studies, one true effect size cannot be assumed; therefore, a random effects model (DerSimonian & Laird) was used to extract the pooled prevalence. Substantial heterogeneity was defined as I2>75%. Subgroup analysis was done in the following categories: gender, rating scales, severity of depression and anxiety and professional group. Sensitivity analysis was done by subtracting each study and calculating the pooled prevalence of the remaining studies, in order to identify studies which may severely affect the pooled prevalence. Our main outcomes were prevalence (p), confidence intervals (CI) and percentage prevalence (p x 100%).",

These results may be partly confounded by the fact that nurses are mostly female but could be also attributed to the fact they may face a greater risk of exposure to COVID-19 patients as they spend more time on wards, provide direct care to patients and are responsible for the collection of sputum for virus detection (Liu et al.,).

In Hong Kong, medical and nursing staff were found vulnerable to burnout, anxiety and mental exhaustion (Cheung et al., 2020) and in Germany doctors reported high levels of anxious and depressive symptoms (Bohlken et al., 2020). Moreover, the psychological impact of the crisis is not only felt by frontline respiratory and intensive care physicians and nurses but also by HCW of other specialties including, for example, surgeons and anesthesiologists (Xu and Xu, 2020). Sadly, there have been also reports of suicides, as health care professionals are faced with accumulated psychological pressure and intense fear of dying (Montemurro, 2020, Papoutsi et al.,0000); this is particularly alarming given the fact that physicians are already at an increased risk of suicide compared to the general population (West et al., 2018). A study exploring factors related to HCWs\u2019 psychological difficulties found that infection of colleagues, infection of family members, protective measures and medical violence (Dai et al., 2019, Liu et al., 2020) were among the main concerns of HCWs in COVID-19 affected areas. Unsurprisingly, level of social support was found to positively correlate with self-efficacy and sleep quality and negatively with anxiety and stress (Xiao et al., 2020).",

Thus, threshold criteria for case definition varied with some investigators intentionally using more lenient criteria in order to capture milder or subsyndromal cases; hence our subgroup analysis by severity. Another limitation is that several studies might have included the same population as they were broadly conducted in the same region/country. Again, as the majority of studies were conducted in China, the generalizability of our findings may be limited. Having said that, generalizing this type of results could pose severe flaws as healthcare systems vary greatly between countries. Nevertheless, considering the fact that China was severely affected, they provide a reliable indication of the potential of COVID-19 pandemic to affect the mental health of HCWs. Furthermore, the studies included in our meta-analysis were all cross-sectional, thus the long-term implications of COVID-19 pandemic on HCW\u2019s mental health warrant further research.",
