The distribution is currently worldwide. The family of Coronaviridae consists of 2 genera, coronavirus and torovirus. These viruses are linear, single stranded RNA viruses. However, only viruses of the Coronavirus genus have been reported to infect poultry. Coronaviruses are enveloped, pleomorphic but usually spherical virus particles of 120 to 140 nm in diameter.",

Infectious bronchitis virus synthesized 5 different sg mRNA and encored for 4 structural proteins, S, E, M, and N and numbers of nonstructural proteins (nsp) that intersperse between other structural proteins (Lai and Cavanagh, 1997). The important antigenic and functional proteins known as spikes (S-protein) are in distinct, club-shaped projection (Sjaak de Wit et al., 2011). Molecular study showed that the S gene of IBV is responsible in determining the serotype or genotype of an IB virus or variant. Only small number amino acids changes in the S1 part of the spike can result in new variant as it is defined by laboratory tests (Sjaak de Wit et al., 2011). Infectious bronchitis virus has the S-protein as 2 subunit, amino terminal S1, and carboxyl terminal S2. S1 is responsible for attachment of virus to cells. S2 is responsible for membrane fusion (Cavanagh, 2007).",

Infectious bronchitis virus also disrupts kidney and reproductive tract, resulting in renal dysfunction and decreased egg production, respectively. Primarily, this disease occurred in young chicken, but it is susceptible toward chickens of all age (Cavanagh, 2007). With the experimental inoculation of IBV in quail, the potential susceptibility of the local domesticated quails against IBV can be determined. This new finding will improve the perceptions toward quail disease management and control, particularly in the tropics.",

This shows quail is potentially susceptible to IBV infection. To further strengthen the arguments, detection of IBV antigen were also positive in organ samples particularly on the trachea (Figure 3). This finding is consistent with another study that indicated that out of the majority of positive organ samples detected with IBV antigen, 50% were from trachea samples (Terregino, et al., 2008). Lung sample was found positive from group B 4 d.p.i and group C 6 d.p.i. However, all kidney samples were tested negative (Table 3). A previous study reported that cecal tonsils and kidney were persistently having continuous excretion of IBV at usually below the detection levels of tests or true re-activation after true latency. Terregino also reported that only in 1 case that the IBV antigen was successfully isolated from kidney. Infectious bronchitis virus was detected from both trachea and kidney at 7th and 14th d.p.i. (Pohuang et al., 2011).",
