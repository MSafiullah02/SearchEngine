We understand the need of some guidelines, but we do not understand the affirmation 'prophylactic granulocyte colony-stimulating factor with systemic anticancer treatment should be considered', 1 appearing in different parts of the manuscript and that seems to suggest that during the infection these factors should be used more frequently than what it is recommended in guidelines 2 and therefore have a protective role. We do not agree with this suggestion, since the severity of this infection seems to be more correlated with a cytokine release picture than with a conventional sepsis or infection and that the haemophagocytic syndrome that critically ill infected patients present is characterised by the increase in various interleukins, and even the granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, among others, and that cytopaenias are more explained by immune phenomenon 3 than as a consequence of treatments.",

The patients we have treated in Spain showed that severity is more associated to an hyperinflammatory syndrome than with a standard sepsis situation, in a context of neutropaenic infection and therefore granulocyte colonystimulating factor (G-CSF) for SARS-CoV-2 may not be useful and even harmful if we treat lung cancer patients with G-CSF.",
