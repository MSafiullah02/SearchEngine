Currently, the mechanism of cellular resistance to viruses mediated through IFITM family proteins is not fully understood. Thus far, diverse approaches have provided evidence that IFITM proteins inhibit viral fusion with the cellular membrane and do not function at steps of receptor binding or conformational changes in pH-dependent virus proteins required for membrane fusion (Brass et al., 2009; Feeley et al., 2011; Li et al., 2013) . In 2013, Li et al. showed that IFITM proteins block hemifusion through changes in the topology of the cellular membrane and protect against virus infections at early stages (Feeley et al., 2011; Li et al., 2013) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 70, "end": 117, "text": "(Poddar, Hyde, Gorman, Farzan, & Diamond, 2016)", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 498, "end": 518, "text": "(Brass et al., 2009;", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 519, "end": 539, "text": "Feeley et al., 2011;", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 540, "end": 556, "text": "Li et al., 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 568, "end": 577, "text": "Li et al.", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 732, "end": 753, "text": "(Feeley et al., 2011;", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 754, "end": 770, "text": "Li et al., 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "pdm09 virus (Echevarr\u00eda-Zuno et al., 2009) , and cases of chikungunya Mac\u00edas-Hern\u00e1ndez, L\u00f3pez-Maga\u00f1a, Fletes-Rayas, & Cambero-Gonz\u00e1lez, 2014 ) and ZIKV infections have recently been reported (Jimenez Corona et al., 2016) . The severity of infections reflects a combination of host and viral genetic components. Therefore, it is important to investigate the molecular aspects of IFITM proteins. The human IFITM3 gene has two exons, and multiple genetic variants have been identified in the coding region (Everitt et al., 2012) . One of these variants, rs12252 (T/C substitution mutation), is an SNP that generates a splice acceptor site, resulting in an isoform (\u22062IFITM3) characterized by the absence of the first N-terminal 21 amino acids (Everitt et al., 2012) .

In Mexico, Moreno-Estrada et al. (2014) used a fine-scale ancestry patterns approach, revealing that a majority of Mexicans are admixed individuals with a large amount of Native and European ancestry and <5% of African ancestry (notably, these authors only analysed those three ancestries). Interestingly, Mexican-Americans in Los Angeles (MXL) did not exhibit a homogeneous pattern, consistent with the diverse origins of these individuals within Mexico (Moreno-Estrada et al., 2014). The frequency differences in rs12252 in western Mexicans compared with other populations sharing the same continent (Medellin, Colombia, Lima, Peru and Puerto Rico) were remarkable. Nevertheless, ancestry proportions of the three American admixed populations were analysed in the 1000 Genomes Project in 2012, wherein Mexico had a minor European ancestry, followed by Colombia and Puerto Rico with the highest proportion of European ancestry (1000 Genomes Project Consortium et al., 2012).In addition, Mexico has the largest proportion of Native American components, followed by Colombia; Puerto Rico has the lowest Native American ancestry(1000 Genomes Project Consortium et al.,   2012, suggesting that although these populations share the same continent, there is a differential genetic structure between them. In addition, a comparison of population differentiation measured by Wright's fixation index (F st ) of native and resident Mexican populations in US with populations sharing the same continent showed that Colombia has a minor genetic differentiation, followed by Peru and Puerto Rico with F st values = 0.0093, 0.0174 and 0.0189, respectively(1000 Genomes Project Consortium et al., 2015.

The average F st values calculated from the 1000 Genomes Project Consortium phase 3 data revealed that the admixed American population has a higher F st value compared with the other ancestries (South Asian = 0.00331, European = 0.00494, African = 0.00661, East Asia = 0.00726 and admixed American = 0.02445), reflecting the differences in the observed frequencies. Nevertheless, a high degree of fine-scale genomic structure across Mexico, shaped by pre-Columbian population dynamics (Moreno-Estrada et al., 2014; Rubi-Castellanos et al., 2009), has been reported and could represent a limitation of the present study, as the western Mexican population does not represent the total population of Mexico, reflecting marked European ancestry differences between cosmopolitan Mexican mestizo populations throughout Mexico and showing a clear north-south decline (Moreno-Estrada et al., 2014). As previously described, the frequency of the rs12252 polymorphism in mestizos of Mexican nationality primarily differs from the frequency of European ancestries. Thus, it will be important to characterize the frequency of the rs12252 marker in the remaining regions of Mexico.", "latex": null, "type": "table"}}, "back_matter": []}
