The SIi,t represents the serial interval of the ith primary case whose onset date is the tth day. G\ni denotes the gender of the ith primary case. Hence, the [exp(\u03b1\n2) \u2013 1] \u00d7 100% quantifies the percentage change, and \u03b2\n2 quantifies the unit change (day) in the serial interval, namely change per day in the calendar date. The gender-specific difference can be interpreted similarly. We fit both models using the standard least-squares approach.",

The Pearson correlation coefficient between the serial interval and calendar date is estimated at \u22120.37 (P < .01).

This result appears slightly but not significantly shorter than the previous estimated \u2018intrinsic\u2019 serial interval, with a mean of 7.5 days.1 The mechanism behind the gender difference remains unknown, but it may be partly due to the fact that male cases are more severe than female cases (ie, \u201cofficials recorded a 2.8% fatality rate for male patients versus 1.7% for female patients\u201d8).
