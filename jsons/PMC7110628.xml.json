These were characterised by a high mortality rate despite intensive treatment. Affected dogs showed severe respiratory distress and a rapidly deteriorating clinical condition. Haemorrhagic pneumonia and severe pleural effusion were diagnosed post mortem. Whilst the disease most commonly occurred in dogs housed in groups, a fatal case in a pet dog has also been reported (Gibson and Richardson, 2008). The causative agent isolated in all cases was Streptococcus equi subsp. zooepidemicus (S. zooepidemicus).",

It may act as an opportunistic pathogen leading to the formation of abscesses, neonatal septicaemia and endometritis with reproductive failure (Timoney, 2004). Severe respiratory disease has been reported in horses following transport stress and the clinical signs are similar to those observed in dogs, with sudden onset dyspnoea and haemorrhagic nasal discharge (Oikawa et al., 1994). The bacterium is also an important pathogen of pigs in Asia, causing widespread disease outbreaks in China in 1975 and Indonesia in 1994 (Soedarmanto et al., 1996, Fan et al., 2008). The infection in pigs was characterised by polyarthritis, bronchopneumonia and diarrhoea, and the disease spread rapidly through pig populations leading to a high mortality. During the outbreak in Indonesia the infection also spread to a monkey population (Soedarmanto et al., 1996).",

More recent prevalence data for healthy dogs are required to determine if carriage has become more common. The bacterium is certainly able to spread between dogs as outbreaks at kennels often affect large numbers of animals within a short time. Analysis of S. zooepidemicus isolates using multilocus sequence typing showed that some canine isolates from geographically distinct locations were genetically related (Webb et al., 2008). This may indicate that certain strains are more able to cause infection and disease in dogs. Other canine isolates are closely related to equine strains, and as horses are frequently infected with S. zooepidemicus, they may act as a reservoir for other species such that the bacterium may be introduced into canine populations by direct contact with horses. This appears unlikely for dogs housed in research facilities and urban kennels although indirect contact via staff members that have been in contact with horses may be important; however this has not been conclusively proven. Molecular typing of isolates may not only help to identify the source of outbreaks but also reveal transmission patterns within populations.",

With increasing prevalence of antibodies to the infectious agent within the population, the rate of mortality would be expected to decrease over time. S. zooepidemicus was rarely isolated from healthy dogs in previous studies (Smith, 1961) and if this still applies it may indicate that few dogs become infected and therefore only a minority of dogs may have acquired a specific immune response to S. zooepidemicus. Alternatively, infection in dogs may be transient and might be missed during prevalence studies.

The dog developed clinical signs of severe dyspnoea and characteristic findings of haemorrhagic pneumonia at post mortem examination. It was however, also shown to be positive for canine distemper virus by immunofluorescence (Garnett et al., 1982). Infections with multiple agents are likely to occur in most kennelled populations. Further studies are required to determine if viral and bacterial co-infections play a role in the pathogenesis of S. zooepidemicus in dogs.",

In this syndrome the main site of inflammation is often the subcutaneous tissue, usually following skin trauma, but there are common clinical features of an acute illness including fever, hypovolaemia and coagulopathy (Lappin and Ferguson, 2009). Toxic shock is characterised by an over exuberant inflammatory response, which leads to increased vascular permeability, vasodilation, increased coagulation and recruitment of inflammatory cells to the site of infection (Lappin and Ferguson, 2009).",

In addition, S. pyogenes produces pyrogenic exotoxins, which act as superantigens (Proft and Fraser, 2003). The presence of superantigen genes in strains of S. pyogenes has been linked to increased virulence in invasive disease (Musser et al., 1991, Luca-Harari et al., 2008). Superantigens activate a large proportion of T-lymphocytes, leading to the production of cytokines, which activate neutrophils and trigger the release of vasoactive factors. These act on the endothelium to increase permeability and cause vasodilation. Cytokines also activate factors which promote coagulation (Lappin and Ferguson, 2009).",

Experience gained from vaccination of other species against streptococcal diseases may however prove valuable for their future development. The immunogenic surface protein SzP of S. zooepidemicus has been expressed in a Salmonella vector for protection of horses against uterine infection. Intranasal vaccination of horses with this construct was shown to induce mucosal immunity by increasing specific IgA levels in nasal and uterine secretions (Causey et al., 2010). SzP has also been shown to be protective in mouse studies (Timoney et al., 1995), however due to a hypervariable region within the protein, cross-protection of vaccines based on SzP against challenge with other strains needs to be determined. Deletion of the gene for SzP has been shown to result in a strain with markedly reduced virulence which conferred protection against challenge to mice (Hong-jie et al., 2009). Targeted mutation to create attenuated strains has also been employed for the development of live vaccines against S. equi in horses. Subunit vaccines, incorporating several S. equi proteins have shown promising results in mice (Waller and Jolley, 2007).",
