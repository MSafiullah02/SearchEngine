Indeed, they could progress to high-risk disease following the acquisition of additional genetic anomalies, and hyperleukocytosis (or increased blasts count in MDS) [4,5].

Delays in the identification of compatible donors are expected and represent a particular challenge when siblings are abroad. The use of home swab kits is a vital resource to enable HLA testing, particularly when access to hospitals for family is restricted. All future donors need to be tested for COVID-19. These aspects have recently been reviewed in detail elsewhere [6,7]. Deferring allogeneic HSCT is recommended if possible; however, transmission from donor to recipient, either in the transfusion of blood products or cellular therapies, has not been yet reported [8]. Literature data on the impact of delayed transplant is ambiguous, obscured by differences in stem cell source and disease subtype. However, if a delay in transplant results in the reappearance of a significant minimal residual disease (MRD), a negative impact on survival is well established [9]. Furthermore, to ensure the possibility of the graft, EBMT strongly recommends securing stem cell product by freezing HSCs prior to conditioning, or to have a back-up donor [7]. It is not presently known if cryo-conservation would negatively impact engraftment success; the use of less favorable stem cell sources in case of optimal donor unavailability might.",
