A number of the studies comparing POC with standard testing16, 18, 40 attributed the increased antiviral use to faster turnaround time to diagnosis by POCT. Given that antivirals are of most clinical benefit if taken within 48 hours of symptom onset,10, 46, 47 this is a key point. In the studies comparing positive and negative POCT results, the increased antiviral use in influenza positive patients is likely due to the removal of diagnostic uncertainty, which also commonly causes patients to be overprescribed antibiotics.48 A positive result may eliminate unnecessary antibiotic prescription, whilst a negative POCT result may allow a bacterial infection to be treated promptly. This was evident in the 11 studies included in this review, which demonstrated that a positive POCT diagnosis led to decreased antibiotic use compared with a negative POCT result.19, 22, 27, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39 Shortening or eliminating avoidable antibiotic use can be of benefit by reducing risk from antibiotic resistance on both a patient and large\u2010scale level.",

Our systematic review highlights the potential of POCTs for influenza in reducing ED LOS; however, results were mixed, and two studies actually reported that POCT led to an increased LOS in ED. Jeong et al27 attributed longer ED stay to the significantly older age of their POCT cohort that may have had more comorbidities, whilst reasons for the other study are unclear.33 Emergency department LOS can be influenced by many factors including availability of beds, overcrowding, admission and discharge procedures, and the efficiency of ED staff. Thus, it may be that the benefits of POCT in terms of ED LOS are somewhat diminished and that this is reflected in the mixed findings of publications in this systematic review. Nonetheless, studies finding reduced ED stay associated with POCT are encouraging, as this can lead to improved clinical outcomes through prevention of nosocomial spread, and easing burden on the healthcare system. More significant reductions in ED LOS can likely be established by further monitoring as health care centres become more familiar with POC technologies.",

An outcome measuring the proportion of patients treated with brief courses of antibiotics may be more clinically relevant in these cases. At times, molecular POCTs were performed by research investigators rather than clinical staff,16, 40 suggesting that the study protocol was not initiated immediately upon ED admission. Adoption of new diagnostic technologies will require changes to management protocol and ED collaboration in order to maximise the benefits of improved clinical decision\u2010making and patient workflow.",

The previous publication was a quantitative analysis of four randomised controlled trials, whereas this systematic review was a qualitative analysis of 30 studies, and thus, we were able to make vastly different conclusions. Our findings were similar to those of another publication50; however, these reviews differed in a number of key ways. The study of Ko and Drews50 is an expert opinion of studies published between January 2000 and June 2016. Their literature search was performed on PubMed only and did not specify criteria for selection of studies. The search for our systematic review was performed on two databases up to December 2017, yielding different results including six recent studies using molecular\u2010based POCTs. Our search was also supplemented by screening citations of included publications and relevant review papers for additional studies meeting our selection criteria.",
