The original reliance on transgenic plants has largely given way to transient expression; proofs of concept for human and animal vaccines and of efficacy for animal vaccines have been established; several plant-produced vaccines have been through Phase I clinical trials in humans and more are scheduled; regulatory requirements are more clear than ever, and more facilities exist for manufacture of clinic-grade materials. The original concept of cheap edible vaccines has given way to a realisation that formulated products are required, which may well be injectable.",

            "text": "The routine production of inexpensive vaccines in plants has for nearly two decades been an idealistic and largely unrealised dream. The romantic notion of 'cheap, edible vaccines' of the early years [see (Fooks, 2000; Giddings et al., 2000; Rybicki, 2009a) ] has not been realised, and indeed, may never be. While the idea of using edible plants or fruits to deliver vaccines is still very attractive-largely because it means that vaccines could be 'pharmed' where they are needed, obviating transport and cold chains, and because oral delivery is seen as being easier and safer than injection-there are simply too many practical and potentially ethical problems with the concept for it to be implemented as envisioned. In the first place, quality control issues would largely preclude on-site production of a vaccine in a food plant: unless every single plant or even every dosage portion of an engineered food was to be assayed for vaccine content, for example, it would be impossible to guarantee that there would be enough of a dose of vaccine for efficacy-or that the plants were even still producing vaccine, or enough of it. Second, the physical administration of such vaccines needs to be regulated, as otherwise too much or too little could be given, and too frequently: the latter prospect especially raises the spectre of immune tolerance to the chosen antigen being elicited, which would negate the whole raison d'\u00ea tre for the vaccine. Thus, the way the field is now developing recognises that even though oral dosing is still a desirable feature, the product itself will have to be processed to some extent, formulated in a reproducible way, and given under supervision so as to ensure reproducible effects.",

Expression systems include stable transgenic or transplastomic plants or plant cell lines, with inducible or constitutive expression, seed-specific expression, and plant virus-based and Agrobacterium tumefaciens-based transient expression systems. There are now registered products, produced according to Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) protocols, entering clinical trials. There are presently several independent facilities capable of manufacturing clinical-grade material for human trial; products have been in, and there are present and planned, clinical trials. Candidate vaccines have been produced for human and animal viruses and bacteria and other parasites; for allergens; and as cancer therapeutics. This review will accordingly summarise some important historical developments in the field, as well as covering future prospects, and discuss aspects of vaccine antigen production relevant to plant biotechnologists.",

In the absence of viable large-scale transient expression technologies pre-late 1990s, this also usually meant stable transgenic plant lines, producing edible leaves, fruits, tubers or seeds. Other considerations were biomass that could be generated, yield and ease of processing. Thus, while vaccine-relevant proteins have been successfully produced in A. thaliana-including antigens from transmissible gastroenteritis virus of swine (Gomez et al., 1998) , Shigella flexneri invasion plasmid antigen IpaC (MacRae et al., 2004) , infectious bursal disease of chickens (Wu et al., 2004) , Mycobacte-rium tuberculosis (TB) ESAT-6 antigen , recombinant hepatitis B \u2044 human immunodeficiency virus [HBV \u2044 HIV particles and HIV-1 p24 protein (Greco et al., 2007; Lindh et al., 2008) and human papillomavirus L1 protein (Kohl et al., 2007) ]-its agronomic properties are such that it would be almost useless as a commercially relevant production system. While leaves and seeds are edible, individual plants simply do not produce enough biomass or enough seed mass to allow an economic production model.",

One early and notable success was the protection of mice against challenge with foot and mouth disease virus (FMDV) after immunisation either via oral or parenteral routes with leaf or leaf homogenates of transgenic alfalfa expressing the structural protein VP1 of FMDV (Wigdorovitz et al., 1999a) . Mice fed on transgenic alfalfa expressing a highly immunogenic epitope from FMDV fused to the glucuronidase (gus A) reporter gene were protected from experimental challenge (Dus Santos et al., 2002) ; mice could be protected against a lethal dose of rabies virus after being fed with transgenic spinach (Modelska et al., 1998) ; HBsAg produced in both transgenic lupins and lettuce elicited specific antibodies in mice and humans, respectively (Kapusta et al., 1999) ; sunflower seed albumin produced in lupin has been tested as an anti-allergen vaccine (Smart et al., 2003) ; the small surface antigen of hepatitis B virus (S-HBsAg) has been produced in transgenic yellow lupin calli or tumours (Pniewski et al., 2006) . The most notable achievement for this sort of expression for human vaccines, however, was probably the demonstration that measles virus haemagglutinin (MV-H) protein could successfully expressed in transgenic lettuce and was immunogenic in mice (Webster et al., 2006) : this followed other work from this group demonstrating first, that plantderived MV-H induced neutralising antibodies in mice (Huang et al., 2001) ; and second, that DNA-mediated measles immunisation could be successfully boosted with an oral plant-derived measles virus vaccine (Webster et al., 2002) .",

Maize or corn seed has been especially popular, because of both the high potential yield of material and the very well-established milling \u2044 processing technology and a number of viral and bacterial antigens and antibodies have been successfully produced. Chikwamba et al.

Indeed, ProdiGene Inc. (TX, USA) built a business portfolio around successful expression of various vaccine and other proteins in maize seed (Lamphear et al., 2002; Horn et al., 2003; Streatfield et al., 2003) and were able to show that maize seed containing a transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) subunit vaccine was an effective booster vaccine for systemic and mucosal immunity in pigs (Lamphear et al., 2004) .",

More recently, an antigen protective against the roundworm Ascaris suum (s16) produced as a fusion chimaera with cholera toxin (CT) B subunit (CTB) elicited an As16-specific serum antibody response when orally administered to mice in combination with CT and resulted in a lower lung worm burden after challenge than in control mice (Matsumoto et al., 2009) .",

However, production of vaccines in edible plants and especially in seed plants has fallen into disfavour in recent years-mostly because of perceived problems with 'contamination' of food crops, due mainly to two incidents involving one company. In the triggering incident in 2002, soya bean and maize harvests in two states in the USA were contaminated with transgenic volunteer maize plant seeds expressing TGEV capsid protein: the company was fined and forced to clean up the seed by the US Department of Agriculture. However, a subsequent similar incident in 2004, where volunteer transgenic maize contaminated an oat crop, which was harvested and baled for use as onfarm animal feed, and was also found growing and flowering in a nearby sorghum field, led to an agreement that the company and its successors would never again apply for a notification or permit to introduce transgenic plants (APHIS, 2008) . The incidents, and the ensuing media and public concern, have led to an effective moratorium on vaccine pharming in edible crops in the USA and indeed worldwide. This trend, together with increasing concern over regulatory compliance of pharmed products, has probably stimulated the increasing use of non-food crop plants for especially vaccine production. Paradoxically, perhaps the most successful use of an engineered potato as a vaccine-the demonstration in 2005 that HBsAg-producing potatoes could be used as a booster vaccine in humans (Thanavala et al., 2005) -was also possibly one of the last times this would be carried out. In a contemporary review, Andy Coghlan of New Scientist commented that 'the newly published study missed a moving target-drug developers are now abandoning their quest for vaccines contained in staple foods like bananas, tomatoes or potatoes' (Coghlan, 2005) .",

However, it was the use of tobacco, which led to many of the early proofs of concept and of principle. Thus, the first proof of concept for production of a vaccine-relevant protein in plants was published exactly 20 years ago: Hiatt et al. (Hiatt et al., 1989) described the successful production of a mouse hybridoma-derived monoclonal antibody (mAb) in transgenic tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.). The first vaccine protein to be produced in any plants was the hepatitis B virus (HBV) surface antigen (HBsAg), just 3 years later: Hugh Mason et al. in Charles W Arntzen's group demonstrated that transgenic tobacco containing the relevant gene under the control of a constitutive promoter produced HBsAg that could, moreover, assemble in planta into the characteristic 22-nm particles first described from the blood of HBV-infected people, and which constitute the basis of the commercial recombinant vaccines Recombivax HB and Engerix B, licenced in 1986 and 1989, respectively (Mason et al., 1992) .",

Singh et al. have recently reviewed protocols for transformation, expression and oral administration; the group of Henry Daniell in particular has pioneered much in this regard (Daniell, 2006; Dhingra and Daniell, 2006 ). An early demonstration from this group of the potential of chloroplast expression was the production in tobacco of viable E. coli LT-B and Cholera vibrio CT-B antigens (Daniell et al., 2001) : at the time they made the point, repeated frequently since, that even very high-level recombinant protein expression by chloroplasts often does not seem to affect plant phenotype as much as nuclearmediated expression. The high-level expression of Clostridium tetanii toxin Fragment C followed (Tregoning et al., 2003) ; so too demonstrations of the production and efficacy of chloroplast-produced Bacillus anthracis (anthrax) protective antigen (PA) (Watson et al., 2004; Aziz et al., 2005; Koya et al., 2005) .",

The HIV-1 Pr 55 Gag protein has also been successfully produced at relatively high levels in transplastomic tobacco (to 360 mg \u2044 kg) and assembled into VLPs similar to those produced in animal cells, which makes this the first vaccine-relevant HIV antigen to be produced in reasonable quantities in plants (Scotti et al., 2009) .

The successful production of antibodies and antibody fragments in tobacco suspension-cultured cells has been reported (Fischer et al., 1999a,b) ; however, this is not being pursued by this group.

While plant cell culture is at first sight not much less technically demanding than-for example-mammalian cell culture such as of the Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells now used routinely for production of many human therapeutics, one very obvious advantage was shown up in 2009-which is that plant-based production is not susceptible to the kinds of contamination experienced by conventional systems. A June 16th 2009 press release on the Genzyme web site (http://www.genzyme.com/corp/media/GENZ%20PR-061609.asp) mentions interference in their CHO cell production of Cerezyme \u00d2 , the commercial Gaucher disease therapeutic, by infection with a calicivirus (Vesivirus 2117) '...likely introduced through a nutrient used in the manufacturing process'. A later report (Bethencourt, 2009) states that 'The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has contacted rival manufacturers Shire of Basingstoke, UK, and Carmiel, Israel-based Protalix, who have enzyme replacement therapies for Gaucher disease in clinical trials, to file treatment protocols, which would allow physicians to use their drugs ahead of approval'.",

This is a problem whether the vectors are delivered via inoculation with in vitro-generated ssRNA or cDNA clones capable of generating infectious transcripts and is because of the increased replicative fitness of the deleted recombinant. An example from our work was the demonstration that the CRPV L1 protein gene expressed in N. benthamiana via rTMV was progressively lost as infected plants developed, leading to lower yields of protein than were obtained in transgenic tobacco (Kohl et al., 2006 ).

The technique has essentially become the gold standard for determining whether or not any given gene can be expressed in plants, and if so, in which cell compartments the protein accumulates best, given a wide variety of vectors available for intracellular targetting of expressed proteins.

An example from our laboratory was the high-level (0.8 g \u2044 kg) expression of HPV-16 L1 protein in N benthamiana, with the demonstration that protein accumulated better when exported to chloroplasts than in the cytoplasm, assembled into VLPs, and elicited neutralising antibodies in mice after injection with or without adjuvant (Maclean et al., 2007) . While several groups have been successful in expressing HIV antigen peptides as chimaeric proteins (Yusibov et al., 1997; Durrani et al., 1998; Matoba et al., 2004) or whole virion capsid p24 protein (Zhang et al., 2002; Obregon et al., 2006; Lindh et al., 2008) , none of these antigens is particularly relevant in the wider search for HIV vaccines compared to the HIV Env or Gag proteins, for example (Baker et al., 2009) . We were successful in expressing whole Pr55Gag but only at very low levels; however, a Gag-derived p17 \u2044 p24 fusion protein could be expressed to 5 mg \u2044 kg if localised to chloroplasts and was a successful booster vaccine from both T-cell and humoral responses in mice primed by a gag DNA vaccine .",

Our group has also used a BeYDV-based agroinfiltration-delivered single plasmid replicon system to significantly boost expression of HPV-16 L1 and HIV p24 and other vaccine proteins in N. benthamiana, compared to nonreplicating controls (Regnard et al., 2010) . A novel gemini-and nanovirusbased technology that has previously been shown to be very effective in the inducible expression of proteins is the 'In-Plant Activation technology' (INPACT) of Farmacule Bio-Industries (Vic., Australia): this is an inducible system that allows amplified replicon-based transgenic expression of even highly toxic molecules (Farmacule, 2009; Rybicki, 2009b )-but should prove equally useful in a transient expression setting.",

Indeed, in many cases yields have been very low, especially in transgenic plants, and proofs of efficacy have suffered as a result. This is of concern for oral vaccination schemes, as experiments have shown that orders of magnitude more protein is required via oral intake than parenterally for the same level of immune response to the same protein, even with the use of potent adjuvants. The landmark 2005 potato-produced HBsAg human clinical trial (Thanavala et al., 2005) is a case in point: while parenteral vaccination requires only 40 lg of HBsAg, oral boosting with three 100-g doses of potato containing HBsAg doses of around 1 mg was only partially effective. It is worth noting that much higher levels of HBsAg expression have since been obtained (Huang et al., 2008) , which may yet make the dream of an oral HBV vaccine a reality. In a direct comparison of oral vs. parenteral dosing with the same HPV vaccine, it was determined that 10 lg \u2044 dose of insect cell-produced HPV VLPs with adjuvant were required to orally immunise mice for the same response elicited by injection of 1 lg (Rose et al., 1999; Gerber et al., 2001) . Others have shown that oral administration of crude extracts of L1-expressing insect cells could induce neutralising antibodies and L1-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocytes, indicating that similar plant preparations might work-especially since yields of between 1-3 g \u2044 kg have been obtained.",

Simply changing host from N tabacum cv. Xanthi to SR1 allowed a 100fold increase in expression of the native viral gene (A Varsani, J Maclean, EP Rybicki, unpublished), to 0.5 mg \u2044 kg. Via agroinfiltration work, we reiterated a surprising earlier finding that a human codon-use optimised gene worked best (Biemelt et al., 2003) and a plant codon-optimised version least well, compared to the native gene sequence, despite using completely different optimisations than the other group. The removal of 24 amino acids at the C-terminus of L1-which dramatically improves expression in yeast and insect cells-had a negative effect in agroinfiltrated plants. We also showed that chloroplast export allowed significantly greater protein accumulation than cytoplasmic and that subsequent generation of transgenic SR1 tobacco with the relevant constructs reiterated the cytoplasmic vs. chloroplast accumulation differences and increased by a factor of 20-fold the previous best transgenic HPV-16 L1 yield, to around 500 mg \u2044 kg. However, this was achieved only in the T1 generation of plants regenerated from transformed callus: expression in all subsequent generations was either much lower or completely absent (J Maclean, M Koekemoer, EP Rybicki, unpublished) . This points up another problem with attempts to maximise constitutive nuclear gene transgenic expression: the fact that gene silencing may occur! Thus, while highlevel HPV-16 L1 protein has been achieved in plants, to levels that could allow oral vaccines to be made, it appears that this will be from agroinfiltrated plants or transplastomic plants rather than from stably transformed conventional transgenics.",

            "text": "The optimisation of relevant HIV antigen expression is also an instructive lesson. While the 'conventional' developers of HIV vaccines are utilising multi-antigen approaches and focussing on whole Gag and Env proteins in particular, it seems that no one has successfully expressed whole HIV Env gp160 protein or even the majority of the protein, in plants at reasonable yield-although expression of a SIV gp130 was reported in maize seed (Horn et al., 2003) . It has been speculated that this may be because of the misdirection of the new protein into the calreticulin pathway; however, there is no hard evidence for this (J. Ma, pers. commun.) . It also appears to be very difficult to express more than portions of Gag in plants via stable or transient nuclear transformation, at reasonable yield . While Tat protein has been produced at quite high yields in spinach and tomato (Karasev et al., 2005; Ramirez et al., 2007) , and Gag-derived p24 capsid protein in tobacco and Arabidopsis (Zhang et al., 2002; Obregon et al., 2006; Lindh et al., 2008) , these proteins are not serious vaccine candidates in the global HIV vaccine hunt. It is most heartening, therefore, that Scotti et al. (Scotti et al., 2009) have recently reported that it is possible to produce whole Pr 55 Gag protein, at levels up to 800 mg \u2044 kg, in transplastomic tobacco. The fact that the protein assembled into VLPs like those produced in animal cell systems, and which are increasingly seen as potential HIV vaccines (Speth et al., 2008; Chege et al., 2009) , means that a viable plant-derived T-cell stimulating HIV vaccine may finally be possible-and could even be orally administered, given the kinds of yield that were demonstrated.",

The automatic assumption that 'plant codon usage' will be optimal is na\u00efve; so too are most assumptions based on experience in other non-plant cell culture systems. There is no one universally suitable host or production system, although the use of agroinfiltration and deconstructed plant viral vectors seems to be on the way to becoming an industry standard. It is advisable to explore all intracellular organelle and export targetting options, but also plastid transformation, as plastid targetting of proteins after cytoplasmic synthesis may not predict what happens with mRNA expression and translation in these organelles.",

            "text": "Some of these principles are illustrated in a simple example taken from our work (Figure 1) . Here, the effects of expression of two versions of a HIV-1 gag gene-derived construct by agroinfiltration in N. benthamiana using a range of vectors targeting proteins to the cytoplasm, the ER and the chloroplasts can be seen. These 3\u00a2-terminal truncated gag genes encode a 'p41' matrix (MA, p17) and capsid (CA, p24) protein fusion, with and without (G2A) a p17 N-terminal myristylation signal: myristic acid addition allows association of the Pr 55 Gag precursor protein (and presumably p41) with the cell membrane and subsequent budding of a VLP. While only the myristylated version buds, there is no difference in total accumulation of either version of Pr 55 Gag in insect cells (Halsey et al., 2008) . In this case, while native p41 accumulated significantly better in chloroplasts than cytoplasm or ER, changing a single amino acid and cancelling myristylation very significantly reduced accumulation of G2A-p41, especially in chloroplasts . Thus, expression of the same protein in insect and animal cells is very different: I have mentioned previously that nuclear expression of whole Pr 55 Gag in plants is very low indeed, whatever the targeting; this contrasts with insect cell expression of the same protein in our hands, which gives reasonable yields (Jaffray MA or p17 is the matrix protein, myristylated at position 2; CA or p24 is the isometric capsid protein; NC or p7 is the nucleocapsid protein; p6 is an accessory protein, which mediates interactions between Pr 55 Gag and Vpr. P41 is a truncated version of Pr 55 Gag comprising only p17 and p24. (b) Transient expression of HIV-1 p41 (p17::p24) protein in Agrobacterium-infiltrated N. benthamiana was measured by commercial HIV-1 p24 ELISA test [described by ] 4 days after infiltration. G2A-p41 is p41 mutated by Gly->Ala replacement at position 2: this removes the myristylation signal. Figure adapted from Meyers et al. (2008 Meyers et al. ( ). et al., 2004 Halsey et al., 2008) . We have now determined that myristylation may also be a significant factor to have to take into account in considering expression potential of a membrane-associating protein.",

            "text": "While the public profile of plant-produced vaccines has been much reduced since its heyday in the 'grow your own vaccine' times in the 1990s, the feasibility and potential efficacy of such vaccines has been well established, and it may be that their time is about to come at last. While many groups have experimented with expressing antigens from human pathogens in plants, it is people working with animal models and animal pathogens who have been able to demonstrate the most convincing proofs of efficacy for plant-produced vaccines in general and for both oral and injectable versions. Among the leaders in this area-possibly because of their working with several versions of the same vaccines, produced via different platforms-is the group at the Instituto de Virologia in Buenos Aires [see review (Dus Santos and Wigdorovitz, 2005) ]. While they have worked extensively on plant-produced FMDV vaccines and shown efficacy in all cases (Wigdorovitz et al., 1999a,b; Dus Santos et al., 2002) , they have also recently been able to produce a partially purified bovine viral diarrhoea virus E2 glycoprotein subunit vaccine from transgenic alfalfa, which injected in equivalent amounts (two doses of 1.5 lg of antigen) protected cattle better than the conventional vaccine [reported in (Rybicki, 2009b) ]. It is quite possible that the first targets of large-scale production of plant-derived vaccines should be diseases of animals, given the easier route to demonstration of efficacy, and the potentially far shorter regulatory path for such vaccines-as has been demonstrated by Dow with their NDV vaccine (Dow AgroSciences, 2008). The prospects for human vaccines are not as clear: while there has been much activity in producing alternatives to established vaccines-such as those to HBV and HPV and rotaviruses, for example-the simple fact is that there is either already enormous established conventional capacity for production of generics, as in the case of HBV, which is now cheap enough to be included in the Extended Programme on Immunisation (EPI) universal infant vaccination bundle or so much capital involved in development and production plants for the new HPV and rotavirus vaccines, for Big Pharma to have no interest in diversifying their means of production. As pointed out elsewhere, even reduction of cost of material and production plant to negligible amounts would only lower the cost of a plant-produced biosimilar or generic version of an established vaccine by a fraction (32%) of the retail price, all other costs (including downstream processing) remaining the same (Rybicki, 2009a) . Thus, it is probably not an option to attempt to compete with established products, but to use the unique advantage of the technology-that is, the huge range in scalability and speed of response-to leverage a niche in 'orphan' vaccines or emerging disease vaccines or even bioterror threats, where other means of production are simply too slow to respond. It is worth stressing the point made by Charles Arntzen and reported elsewhere (Rybicki, 2009b) that 'The plant advantage over older technologies [is] speed to new production and platform flexibility in terms of several ways to produce antigen'. In this regard, the deconstructed viral vectors and even simple agroinfiltration are extremely potent tools for both pilot production and for scaling to full-scale production, in rapid-response scenarios.",

This is almost certainly the fastest production ever for any current pandemic or even seasonal influenza vaccine and represents a thorough vindication of the approach. The influenza pandemic response potential of the technology is explored elsewhere in this volume (D'Aoust et al., 2010) . The subject of new technologies for influenza seasonal and pandemic vaccines, and in particular the use of plants, has been well and comprehensively reviewed recently (Chichester et al., 2009a) ; suffice it to say here that there is ample evidence that plants may be a very viable vehicle for rapid-response or even conventional vaccine production for the prevention of influenza. The recent demonstration of the ability of VAXX Inc. to quickly produce gram quantities of a diarrhoea-causing norovirus subunit vaccine (Dylewski, 2009) is also very promising, given that this virus too is subject to rapid mutational change.",

There are now many proofs of concept and several of efficacy for oral immunisation in animal models-and the recent demonstrations that very high yields of human vaccine candidates can be obtained via plastid transformation or transient expression in plants makes the dream of 'heatstable oral vaccines' [Charles Arntzen, quoted in (Rybicki, 2009a) ] suddenly almost reachable. For example, while it may be true that 10-30\u00b7 as much antigen is needed via the oral route as is required parenterally for the same immune response, if this much antigen can be reliably provided by one tobacco plant and can be suitably and cheaply purified by a simple process, then it becomes eminently possible to exploit the technology for the original goal.",

In fact, the insistence among many in this research field that oral administration is needed for mucosal immunity may need to rethink their assumptions: in a landmark 1998 article, the following quote may give pause for thought. 'Based on these observations [comparisons of mucosal and parenteral vaccination with conventional vaccines], it is suggested that development of serum immunological responses are effective in the prevention of systemic disease regardless of the types of vaccines or route of their administration. However, induction of pathogen-specific antibody or cellular immunity at the mucosal sites [my emphasis] is best elicited by mucosal application of the antigen' (Kaul and Ogra, 1998) . Thus, plant-made vaccines may overlap far more than was formerly thought possible with conventional vaccines, in that injectable 'biosimilars' or even 'biobetters', as defined by Yuri Gleba (Rybicki, 2009b) , could compete directly with those produced by fermentation or animal cell culture.",

            "text": "While the long-term future of plant-produced vaccines has always seemed bright, there has also been a disjunction between the present and this future, which has been hard to bridge. For example, it appears obvious that all subunit vaccines should be made in plants where this is feasible-yet none are, even for animals, despite all the proofs of efficacy over more than 10 years. There is also much made of the apparent reluctance of large pharmaceutical and other companies to become involved-yet when they do (e.g. Bayer and Dow), the impact is profound. Perhaps it will take the incremental successes of plant-made therapeutics such as Protalix's glucocerebrocidase and the Japanese AIST group's canine IFna produced in strawberries for treatment of dog periodontal disease (Rybicki, 2009b) , followed by vaccines for livestock such as the Argentinean BVDV vaccine, and human therapeutics such as rabies virus antibodies and even insulin and vaccines like ICON Genetics' NHL product, to finally tip the balance for broad-based acceptability of plant-based vaccines for human use. The apparent acceptance by the relevant funding agencies in the USA that rapid-response vaccines aimed at potential bioterror agents such as anthrax and haemorrhagic fever viruses could easily be made in plants may be a valuable lever in this regard. If acceptance does happen soon, then obvious first targets-other than the military options-should be the niche market of 'orphan disease vaccines' such as for Lassa fever and the South American haemorrhagic fever viruses, and other low volume markets, rather than competitors for blockbuster vaccines such as HPV and rotavirus. Increasing acceptability in the long term could mean a shift to the mainstream high volume \u2044 low cost generics market-which would appear to be ideally suited for this technology.",

The purified H5-derived VLPs were highly immunogenic: two doses of 0.5 lg of H5-VLPs conferred complete protection against a lethal challenge with a heterologous (A \u2044 Vietnam \u2044 1194 \u2044 04) virus.",
