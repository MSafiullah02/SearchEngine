As is the case with all other species, rats are susceptible to a variety of injuries and diseases that can cause distress, morbidity, or mortality. Any facility that houses rats must develop monitoring programs designed to rapidly identify health-related problems so they can be communicated to appropriate veterinary or animal care personnel to be resolved. These programs generally consist of multiple components, some of which are directed towards individual animals, and others that assess the health status of rat populations as a whole. Relevant aspects of medical management of rat colonies include individual animal monitoring and care; signs of illness and distress; colony health management; components of microbiological monitoring programs, including agents commonly targeted and sentinel programs; quarantine; biological material screening; diagnostic testing methodologies, including culture, serology, molecular diagnostic and histopathology; test profiles and interpretation; management of disease outbreaks; and treatment and prevention strategies for infectious agents.",

The persons given the responsibility for this observation need to have had sufficient training or previous experience with rats in order to adequately detect abnormalities that might be present. Grossly visible trauma or lesions may not always be present in ill rats, but more subtle behavioral clues might be present. For this reason, it is important to be familiar with the normal range of behavioral patterns observed in healthy captive rats, which has been described (Saibaba et al., 1995).",

Weight loss is another nonspecific finding, but since weight determination is a simple, rapid, objective, and noninvasive technique, it is commonly used to assess the general health status of an animal placed under. It should be realized that stress is not always manifested as an absolute weight loss in a growing animal, so it may be necessary to take into account the normal weight gain of young rats in order to document a variation (Dymsza et al., 1963).",

Because both the disease state and the use of xenobiotics (antibiotics) can affect the physiology of animals in a way that is difficult to control within the experimental design and could invalidate a study (Lipman and Perkins, 2002), ill rats are often euthanized rather than treated. However, the situation surrounding the incident should be carefully considered to determine whether it is prudent to gather appropriate antemortem diagnostic samples and to submit the carcass for necropsy evaluation even if the animal is terminated. Likewise, a process to monitor animal mortality records and to perform necropsy on animals whose death is suspicious is quite important, because in some cases such an evaluation can allow early detection of a problem that otherwise would reoccur and eventually affect a much larger group of animals.",

Such conditions can only be detected and identified via sensitive and comprehensive testing protocols (Institute for Laboratory Animal Research-National Research Council, 1991). Despite the lack of observable morbidity or mortality, these subclinical infections pose a significant risk to the research conducted with affected animals because they can alter the background physiology of experimental subjects or cause variation and alteration in specific experimental responses. These adverse effects have been summarized in a number of reviews (Institute for Laboratory Animal Research-National Research Council, 1991; Baker, 1998; Nicklas et al., 1999; Lipman and Perkins, 2002; Baker, 2003), and more recent studies continue to add to the list of potential adverse implications (Ball-Goodrich et al., 2002). Two of the physiologic processes that have specifically been shown to be altered by the presence of these infectious agents in rodents include immune function and neoplasia, which are quite relevant since immunogenetics, transplantation, and tumor biology are three of the disciplines that most heavily depend on the use of rats (Gill et al., 1989). As a result, one of the primary aims of a rodent colony health monitoring program is to document the presence or absence of particular infections agents irrespective of any observable disease state. A term which is generally synonymous with colony health monitoring and is often used to convey this emphasis is microbiologic monitoring (Fujiwara and Wagner, 1994; Waggie et al., 1994).",

Significant risks of one or more of these agents being introduced still exist in contemporary colonies.

Terms that are less useful without detailed backup information include specific pathogen-free (SPF), and conventional. In general use, SPF refers to animals that are 1) considered to be free of major pathogens and some or all opportunists, 2) maintained under housing and use conditions designed to protect this high-quality status by excluding infectious agents, and 3) monitored closely to assure that there is no undetected introduction of excluded agents. Conventional animals are usually considered to be those that originate from uncontrolled colonies that are not subjected to routine health monitoring, or those in which some degree of monitoring occurs but there is no action taken if infectious agents are found. However, these terms are not really descriptive or representative enough to use when assigning risk to animals proposed for introduction to monitored, disease-free animal facilities. For example, animals from an institution that experienced an outbreak of rat coronavirus and decided not to undertake the steps needed to eliminate the agent from the facility can still be considered to be \u201cSPF\u201d, since by definition this status is only defined by the particular list of agents of which the animals are specifically free. The term conventional also suffers from some ambiguity, since it can be used to refer to not only to animal health status but also to facility design. For example, a facility that allows direct staff entry into rat rooms without changing out of street clothes would be termed a conventional facility rather than a \u201cbarrier\u201d in the purest sense, but if micro-isolators and high efficiency particulate air (HEPA)-filtered changing hoods have been used to successfully institute pathogen exclusion at the cage level, the animals themselves might possess a high-quality health status that is far from \u201cconventional.\u201d In practice, it may be more effective to evaluate a specific panel of agents that animals have been tested for than to assign quality descriptions.",

When selecting animals for screening, there are certain points to keep in mind. Animals to be sampled should be taken from rack and shelf locations spread throughout the room to maximize the possibility of detecting an isolated focus of contamination. If multiple stocks or strains are present, an attempt should be made to sample representative rats from each of these subcolonies. It is also desirable to test both young and old animals (avoiding geriatric animals) if they are available, since parasite burdens may be higher in the young (Institute for Laboratory Animal Research-National Research Council, 1991), while the old would have had the best chance of seroconverting to agents that may have not yet affected younger animals. In a breeding colony, ideal choices might be retired breeders and surplus weanlings. Immunodeficient animals are a good choice for detecting parasites and bacterial contamination, since they may have a lowered resistance to such agents. However, it is important to remember that serology will be subject to false negative results if performed on an animal with a genetic or induced immunosuppression that may impair the antibody response. The purpose of health surveillance is generally not to accurately determine the specific prevalence of infection or disease in an area, but rather to accurately identify its presence by finding at least one positive animal in an endemic colony (Institute for Laboratory Animal Research-National Research Council, 1991). The minimum number of animals from a population that need to be tested in order to identify one positive animal can be viewed as a statistical exercise in random sampling. Probability theory can provide the equation necessary to determine the sampling size needed, based on the assumption that one is dealing with an ideal population (100 or more animals, where all animals have an equal opportunity for pathogen exposure) and calculated based on variables such as the prevalence of infection (often estimated at 30%) within the population and the degree of confidence required in the result (Clifford, 2001). These equations have been used to prepare charts that have been published to assist in the selection of sample size (Small, 1984; DiGiacomo and Koepsell, 1986; Institute for Laboratory Animal Research-National Research Council, 1991). For example, if an infectious agent affects 25% of the rats in a population, one would only need to test 15 randomly selected individuals in order to have a 99% probability of detecting the agent. These calculations have the most robust application when dealing with large populations of animals held under conditions that provide little or no barrier to cage-to-cage transmission (that is, an open shoe box or suspended caging with no filter tops) because, under those circumstances, agents are fairly uniformly distributed and would be expected to have a prevalence of 30% or higher. Under those circumstances, even if a room holds 1000 rats, it would still only be necessary to sample 8 of them to be 95% sure that an agent is not present. Many vendor quality assurance programs are based on this type of calculation.",

            "text": "Alternatives to a random sampling approach are needed because a large percentage of rats in contemporary research colonies are housed under circumstances that do not result in a uniform distribution of transmissible agents, due to the popularity and utility of cubicles (segregating fewer than 100 animals into functional groups) and/or systems that provide a barrier at the cage level, such as static microisolators or ventilated rack caging. These housing systems are beneficial in decreasing the likelihood of disease transmission, but they also make it harder to detect infectious agents based on random screening protocols, because the agent distribution is not uniform and the prevalence of infection may be far below 30%. Another problem with random screening techniques is the impracticality of selecting and testing animals from active research colonies without disrupting the ongoing research. For this reason, it is common to place sentinel animals into a colony for the sole purpose of health status testing. These animals are not assigned to any particular study, and under ideal circumstances they will be exposed to the same agents as the principal animals actually being used for research. Because they exist solely for the screening program, sentinels can be bled, sampled, or removed for nonsurvival testing at the discretion of the colony management, without interfering with ongoing experiments.",

The use of aged rats should be avoided if possible, as these animals may be more prone to false positive seroreactivity (Wagner et al., 1991). Selection of a particular stock or strain of rat to be used as sentinels will vary, and there is no single correct choice. Using the same stock and source as the principals that are being monitored may be ideal because it eliminates the additional risk of contamination that would occur if animals were imported from another source specifically to be used as sentinels (Institute for Laboratory Animal Research-National Research Council, 1991). For closed breeding colonies, this can be done by setting aside some of the animals bred locally to be used as sentinels, and if animals are commercially obtained, extra animals can be ordered along with the principal shipment. However, this approach is not always practical in non-closed colonies, and it is common for facilities to specifically order sentinel animals from a reliable commercial source to be used as sentinels. In this case, a readily available outbred line is often chosen for sentinel use, since they are inexpensive and will generally mount a robust antibody response. Inbred lines can also be used, but it is important to consider any strain-specific limitations of disease susceptibility or immune responses, since these may affect their utility as sentinels. Occasionally, sentinels will be chosen so that they have a coat color that differs from the principal animals they are associated with to minimize the possibility that they will be mistaken for experimental animals.",

It is desirable to place them in a consistent spot on each rack so that husbandry and research staff can anticipate their location. If a single cage is used, it is customary to place it on the bottom shelf, since it is assumed that the concentration of aerosolized agents and particulate fomites will be highest near the floor. There are no firm guidelines for the relative density of sentinels, but for logistical reasons at least one sentinel cage should be in place on each rack or in each cubicle. The placement of one sentinel cage on each standard 25-cage rack has historically worked well in most situations. Other approaches can be taken, such as allocating sentinel cages to each breeding or experimental subgroup, placing multiple cages on each rack to increase the theoretical sensitivity of the program, etc. Depending on the specific design of the program, each sentinel cage may contain either a single animal or a small group of rats. When multiple sentinels of the same age are kept in a cage, it is rarely useful to sample more than one at any time, since the microbiological status of cohabitating animals is generally uniform. The use of small groups offers an advantage: the other sentinels in the cohort can be used to confirm positive results found in the rat initially submitted for testing.",

However, it should be noted that, in this type of situation, the subpopulation of rats with the highest cumulative risk of becoming infected with an agent (for example, the sentinel cages receiving a constant flow of dirty bedding) are NOT being held with the same degree of cage-level containment as the principal animals, and if they do become infected, the amount of environmental contamination and subsequent cross-contamination to other cages in the home room or elsewhere may be increased. Since other open sentinel cages in the room would be at highest risk for secondary transmission, it also may become more difficult to determine the point of origin of an agent within a room if sentinels are becoming infected, not from their assigned principal cages, but from other sentinel cages, essentially giving a type of false positive result (Weisbroth et al., 1998).

However, to ensure that the transfer of bedding is having a net positive impact on colony health (by aiding in the detection of excluded agents) rather than a net negative impact (by increasing the cage-to-cage transmission between principal cages) this practice should be standardized and incorporated into both written procedural descriptions and employee training programs.

The time it takes a sentinel to be exposed to endemic infection would be expected to vary depending on specifics such as 1) the relative density of sentinels, 2) the frequency of cage changing and soiled bedding transfer, 3) the percentage of principal cages that have bedding sampled at each change, 4) the caging system in place, 5) the prevalence and transmissibility of the infectious agent present, and 6) possibly the macroenvironmental characteristics of the room, such as relative humidity and ventilation. Once a sentinel is exposed, there will be an additional delay until the development of an immune response ascends to levels that can be detected by serologic means. Experimentally, it has been shown that sensitive antibody determination tests can identify seroconversion in a period as short as 1 week post-exposure for rats infected with agents such as the rat coronavirus/sialodacryoadenitis virus (RCVSDAV) (Smith, 1983) and the RV parvovirus (Ball-Goodrich et al., 2002). However, a more \u201caverage\u201d timeframe is within the range of 2 to 3 weeks, and it is felt that the utility of testing results will be greatest if a period of 21 to 28 days is allowed for seroconversion. For this reason, sentinels should generally not be sampled before they have had at least 1 month of exposure. It cannot be assumed that an agent will make its way into a sentinel cage during the first week or two, so many programs allow for an exposure period longer than 1 month (for example, utilizing 2 to 3 months of exposure as part of a quarterly monitoring schedule).",

If the intent is to fully evaluate the status of all animals delivered, this testing must be repeated for each breeding unit of animals accepted from the vendor, and it should also account for the fact that vendors may produce the same strain in multiple, physically distinct breeding or holding areas (Small, 1984). Such a program might be feasible for facilities with a very limited list of vendors and a small number of strains in use, but is often impractical for facilities that serve large, multidisciplinary institutions. In this situation, a more limited and targeted vendor surveillance program might be useful (for example, surveying animals when a new vendor is under consideration, or getting more information if there are specific concerns about the status of animals from a particular vendor for some reason). Occasionally, the status of the vendor's production colony is not in question, but possible contamination during transport and delivery is suspected. If that is the case, incoming vendor animals for testing should not be killed upon arrival, but should be placed in a quarantine facility that provides for not only containment but also exclusion of infectious agents (to eliminate confounding cross-contamination within the facility). They can then be given time to fully colonize with and or seroconvert to agents they were exposed to in transport, and tested on a schedule similar to other animals subjected to quarantine.",

Room-level isolation would be ideal, but often there are space constraints when dealing with small shipments of rodents, and the common procedure is to utilize flexible-film isolators, cubicles, or ventilated cabinets of some type to partition a quarantine room (Small, 1984). In contemporary colonies, the introduction of a novel, noncommercial rat strain is a much less frequent occurrence than the transfer of a mutant mouse line. However, if this activity increases in the future (as many in the field feel that it will) it may be necessary to consider programs similar to those described for mouse quarantine that group multiple shipments into a single cohort for batch testing (Rehg and Toth, 1998). The availability of microisolator-type caging, either as static units or within ventilated racks, has also allowed programs to be designed that are not all-in-all-out but still allow functional isolation and segregation of multiple shipments within the same room (Institute for Laboratory Animal Research-National Research Council, 1996b; Otto and Tolwani, 2002). Although this option will provide more flexibility and may reduce the space requirements for quarantine, proper operational procedures are extremely important, since the whole system is reliant upon proper technique.",

Members of the Pasteurella pneumotropica complex often colonize the murine respiratory tract and can cause opportunistic infections in rats as well as mice (Kohn and Clifford, 2002). Emerging pathogens such as newlydiscovered parvoviruses and members of the bacterial genus Helicobacter have been studied and characterized primarily in mice, but since they can colonize rats, facilities should begin to develop plans for monitoring these agents and taking action should they be found (Riley et al., 1996; Ball-Goodrich et al., 1998; Haines et al., 1998; Goto et al., 2000; Wan et al., 2002). Although it would be rarely encountered in rat colonies maintained at a high health status, many facilities opt to monitor for the bacterial agent Streptobacillus moniliformis, because it can cause a zoonotic disease (rat bite fever) and also could be a marker for wild rat contamination. Other potential pathogens include the Theiler murine encephalomyelitis virus-like agent, reovirus-3, mouse adenovirus-1, and Pneumocystis carinii. The latter is likely carried by most rats, but its potential to cause clinical or histologic disease is primarily in immunodeficient rats.",

An ideal test is one that in all cases clearly distinguishes between exposed and unaffected animals (Weisbroth et al., 1998). Diagnostic tests can be assessed via several parameters (Table 16-3\n; from Bellamy and Olexson, 2000). In general, diagnostic sensitivity and specificity are of greatest importance when designing a health monitoring program. Tests with high sensitivity will generate a very low percentage of false negative results, whereas tests with high specificity will generate a low percentage of false positive results. Tests with high (> 90%) sensitivity and specificity (for example, serology) should be used when available. For those tests that lack sensitivity or specificity (for example, histology), results must be interpreted accordingly. Other parameters, such as positive and negative predictive values, may also be of value in interpreting results, however these parameters can be affected by agent prevalence. For example, when agent prevalence is low, the calculated positive predictive value may also be misleadingly low (Lipman and Homberger, 2003). While highly sensitive and specific tests are available, it should be realized that no test is 100% sensitive or 100% specific. To this end, all unexpected results should be confirmed either through the use of corroborative testing platforms, the testing of additional animals, or both. In no case, should a decision about colony status be made based on a single positive result.",

As a result, sentinel and colony monitoring programs have been developed.

As a result, colony management decisions can be implemented while confirmatory tests are being pursued. Gross necropsy examinations are also often a component of health monitoring screens. Such necropsy examinations usually include a thorough examination of major organ systems with sample collection dependent on gross findings. Gross necropsy may reveal a multitude of lesions including abscesses, pneumonia, developmental defects, urolithiasis, neoplasia, trauma, and malocclusion. Unfortunately, there are few gross lesions that are pathognomonic for specific infectious diseases.

Serum is added and if antibody to the antigen is present, it will bind in a specific manner. Antibodies not specific for the antigen are removed in subsequent washing steps. Following washing, enzyme-labeled antibodies that are specific for rat antibody (enzyme conjugated anti-immunoglobulin) are added. These bind to rat antibodies that were bound in the first step. The last step involves the addition of a substrate for the enzyme label.

The use of highly purified subunit antigens may increase specificity as cross-reactive impurities are not present. However, the use of these subunit antigens may negatively impact sensitivity (Compton and Riley, 2001). This happens because the host response is polyclonal, with many antibodies being produced to different epitopes on the infectious agent. Highly purified subunit antigens may lack the immunodominant epitopes to which antibodies have been produced and result in a test with decreased sensitivity when compared to one that utilizes crude protein preparations. Moreover, agents may express different epitopes during different stages of disease. Therefore, an ELISA that uses an antigen that is only expressed at certain stages may miss some infections.

The secondary antibody is labeled with a fluorescent molecule rather than an enzyme (fluorescent dye-conjugated anti-immunoglobulin). Sensitivity is similar to ELISA. Specificity is equal to or better than ELISA because patterns or location of fluorescence may provide additional information (granular or nuclear fluorescence may be consistent with certain viral infections as opposed to diffuse fluorescence, which may indicate a non-specific reaction).

The main disadvantages of IFA are that it is labor intensive, and interpretation is subjective and dependent on the expertise of the observer.

Because of this large window of opportunity, serologic testing at a single time point cannot distinguish active from prior infections (for example, the infectious potential of a rat tested). Serology also allows for multiple tests to be run on a single serum sample. Although serology has few limitations, it is unreliable in the diagnosis of infections in immunodeficient rodents (Compton and Riley, 2001; Livingston and Riley, 2003) and, as mentioned earlier, cannot distinguish exposure from active infection. Both ELISA and IFA are subject to non-specific reactivity, which can lead to false positive results. This is especially true in bacterial ELISAs due to the complexity and abundance of potentially cross-reactive bacterial antigens.

Culture is especially useful when evidence of infection such as abscess formation or pneumonia is present. Culture is most effective during the height of infection, and prior to administration of antibiotics or the development of an immune response (Compton and Riley, 2001). Culture may also be used as a screening tool for pathogens or agents capable of causing opportunistic infections. In the latter scenario, mucosal sites of the intestinal tract (for example, the cecum) and respiratory tract (for example, the nasopharynx) are cultured on broad spectrum or selective media. Bacterial speciation is based on colony morphology, Gram staining characteristics, organism morphology, biochemical tests, and growth on selective media or in selective conditions (Feldman, 2001; Livingston and Riley, 2003). Culture has the advantage of determining whether a live agent is present, as opposed to potentially nonviable DNA remnants or antibacterial antibodies from a past infection, in the animal. Culture and subsequent biochemical analyses are also very specific for most agents and can be supplemented with molecular techniques where speciation is desired. Culture does have some drawbacks. For example, agents colonizing the mucosal surface may be present in low numbers or sequestered in areas not accessed by routine procedures (for example, the deep recesses of the nasal turbinates). Moreover, fastidious organisms may not grow well unless conditions are optimized, or their growth may be hindered by the growth of more vigorous bacteria. Some agents may take several days to grow into identifiable colonies, while some agents such as CAR bacillus and Clostridium piliforme have yet to be cultivated on cell-free media. Collection of samples for submission to diagnostic laboratories may also be problematic in that some bacteria, notably the Pasteurellaceae, do not survive well in transfer media.",

Oligonucleotide primers specific for the agent (complementary to the specific microorganisms genome and typically situated a few hundred base pairs apart) are added and allowed to anneal to target sequences in the sample DNA. A polymerase (for example, Taq polymerase), an enzyme that functions in DNA synthesis, is added along with nucleotide bases and new DNA strands of a specific size are created. After \u201cn\u201d cycles of this 3-step process of denaturation, annealing, and synthesis, the target sequence is amplified 2nth times (30 cycles = 230 = 1,073, 741, 824 copies of DNA). The product is then subjected to gel electrophoresis, and if a targeted sequence is amplified, it will migrate to a specific location based on its molecular weight. RNA (RNA viral genomes) may also be detected by PCR. In this case, reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) is utilized. With RT-PCR, RNA is converted to complementary DNA (cDNA) using the enzyme, reverse transcriptase. This cDNA becomes the template for PCR, as described earlier. Because RNA is very susceptible to degradation, additional protective steps in sample preparation and storage should be incorporated.",

This problem is being addressed by the development of high-throughput multiplexed assays where multiple agents can be tested in a single reaction.

PCR is an ideal primary test for the detection of active or persistent infections (for example, infections by parvoviruses, LCMV, RCMV, Mycoplasma pulmonis, Helicobacter spp.) or those agents for which other diagnostic tests are of poor sensitivity (for example, the culture of Helicobacter spp.). In contrast, detection of infections where colonization is transient (many viral infections) is possible for only brief periods of time. In the latter case, PCR may serve as an adjunct test. In this scenario, infections may be detected by a primary test such as serology. To confirm infection, additional rats of appropriate target age (an age at which colonization or shedding is expected) are selected and target tissues are tested by PCR. This two-methodology approach provides very convincing evidence of infection. Moreover, although PCR cannot distinguish between live and dead organisms, results from PCR testing can provide valuable information about the current status (actively shedding, free of colonization) among individual animals or groups of animals.",

For this test, a piece of clear cellophane tape is applied to the perineal skin, placed on a microscope slide, and examined for typical banana-shaped ova.

The disadvantages of histology as a screening tool include the narrow window of opportunity to detect certain transient infections and the fact that many opportunistic pathogens do not cause histologic disease. Screening of tissues may be useful in several situations: 1) screening of target tissues for known lesions of infectious disease; 2) screening immunodeficient rats in which tests such as serology are not appropriate; 3) detecting disease early in its time course prior to the development of detectable antibody; 4) detecting bacterial agents that are difficult to cultivate (such as CAR bacillus and Clostridium piliforme); and 5) detecting emerging or previously unrecognized infectious diseases. The latter is exemplified by the recent discovery of rat respiratory virus. This agent was discovered after the recognition that chronic idiopathic interstitial pneumonia became prevalent in several colonies of rats (Simmons and Riley, 2002).

The design of these testing profiles requires consideration of several factors as outlined in earlier sections of this chapter. Tiered testing strategies are very economical and are becoming commonplace (Laber-Laird and Proctor, 1993). With these strategies, the most prevalent agents are tested for on a frequent basis via inexpensive high-throughput tests, while testing for agents of low prevalence or screening of animals for indication of emerging diseases occurs on a less frequent basis. For example, rats may be screened for pinworms, fur mites, M. pulmonis, RCV SDAV, pneumonia virus of mice (PVM), and parvoviruses on a quarterly basis while less prevalent agents such as Corynebacterium kutscheri, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Sendai, REO3, LCM, MAD1, CAR bacillus and Clostridium piliforme are tested for once a year (Nicklas et al., 2002).",

Decisions about rodent health should rarely if ever be made on a single positive result and the latter should be assumed to be a false positive until verified (Laber-Laird and Proctor, 1993; Compton and Riley, 2001; Livingston and Riley, 2003). Verification may include testing a sample (serum) using an alternative test platform, testing a second sample from the affected animals using an alternative test platform (for example, through PCR), or testing cohort animals (Weisbroth et al., 1998; Livingston and Riley, 2003). As discussed earlier, there are two primary serologic testing platforms: ELISA and IFA. These platforms can also be used as adjuncts for each other. In most diagnostic laboratories, the ELISA serves as the primary test, and borderline or solitary positive results are confirmed by IFA. Confirmatory testing may also involve the use of different testing platforms. For example, if a rat is found to be seropositive for CAR bacillus, the lungs may be examined with a silver stain to detect the presence of the organism. Often, only serum is collected for health monitoring, so samples for confirmatory testing by other platforms may not be possible. In these cases, testing of cohort animals may be warranted and a diagnostic plan to test with different testing platforms should be designed. For example, if a rat is found to be seropositive for a rat parvovirus, additional animals from that colony may be tested by serology and their mesenteric lymph nodes may concurrently be tested by PCR for rat parvovirus. Testing of cohort animals is also warranted in the case where very few animals are seropositive. This scenario may indicate an early outbreak or a false positive result. If an early outbreak is occurring, cohort animals will have additional time to seroconvert and the percentage of positives should increase.",

Based on this information, if an excluded agent appears to be present, the room should be quarantined to prevent further spread throughout the facility. Scheduled incoming shipments should be diverted to other areas, and transfers out of the room should be canceled. Changes to standard practices that have the potential to affect cross-contamination should be considered, such as the room entry order, the handling and transport of soiled cages, the protective clothing and disinfectants used in the room, and the amount of personnel traffic allowed. A follow-up plan should be implemented to establish whether the agent truly does exist within the room by testing remaining sentinels or principal animals.

If the animals are replaceable and the primary consideration is to return the room to normal use, complete depopulation followed by environmental decontamination can be performed. Attempting partial depopulation by removing positive animals (via test and cull) is not a very productive approach for most rodent colony disease outbreaks due to the large numbers of animals often involved, the delay between exposure and seroconversion, and the possibility that the disease will be further spread during the handling and sampling procedures needed to test the entire population. As an alternative approach, if the agent does not establish persistent infection, it may be useful to test and remove the negative animals. Fully immune populations should pose little risk of shedding to na\u00efve animals after infection by agents such as coronavirus or Sendai virus. By retaining only previously exposed seropositive animals to re-establish a breeding program, it is possible to produce seronegative offspring (Brammer et al., 1993). A related approach to break the chain of transmission and repopulate an area without determining the serologic status of each individual rat allowed to remain is the cessation of breeding method, also known as burnout or stop-breeding schemes. By eliminating the introduction of na\u00efve animals from outside and eliminating all internal breeding for a period of time (6 to 8 weeks is recommended) coronavirus can be eliminated from a population (Bhatt and Jacoby, 1985; Jacoby and Gaertner, 1994). Reciprocal transfer of soiled bedding between all cages during the early weeks of a burnout period can help assure that all animals have had equivalent exposure to the agent. Of note, these techniques may not work in immunodeficient rats and should be used with caution in genetically engineered rats.",
