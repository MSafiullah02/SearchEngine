Much of this alarm was due to the information emitted on the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of the infection: a high capacity for contagion and rapid spread [1, 2]. Unlike seasonal influenza, the infection affected mostly young people and fewer people aged >65 years [3]. Initially, it was regarded as a potentially severe disease, with a high mortality rate, above all in young people without comorbidities, who required intensive care [4\u20136]. Obesity and pregnancy were identified as risk factors [4, 7\u20139].",

Molecular microbiological determinations were used to provide an early diagnosis of the virus. The specific treatment of the virus was standardized for all infected patients admitted. Extraordinary resources were provided in order to increase intensive care unit (ICU) staff.

Most studies have focused on epidemiological aspects of the general population and on patients admitted to ICUs. Selecting the most seriously ill patients exclusively according to ICU admittance involves significant bias, due to the variability in ICU selection criteria [10, 11], especially if the initial alarm raised by the pandemic and the emphasis on critical care is taken into account. In addition, the information available on risk factors groups children and adults together. It is reasonable to suppose that serious risk factors could differ between children and adults and, in addition, the hospital care of children and adults is structured differently. No in-depth studies have been carried out to identify risk factors of severe evolution for adult patients hospitalized for influenza A (H1N1) 2009 virus infection in order to manage these patients.",

Cases and controls were recruited between July 2009 and February 2010. A case was defined as a patient admitted to hospital for >24 h with influenza A (H1N1) virus infection laboratory-confirmed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Twenty-five patients aged \u226518 years were recruited from each of the 36 study hospitals, and were chosen by the systematic sampling of all patients admitted with laboratory-confirmed influenza A (H1N1) 2009 virus infection [12]. For the purpose of this article, only the prospective cohort of patients admitted to any of the participant hospitals were included (the cases) and the controls are not included. Therefore, for this study, based in our selection criteria, we included only adult cases (\u226518 years) who were hospitalized selected from the 36 hospitals studied. We excluded patients who had nosocomial infection, defined as pandemic virus infection in a patient that appears \u226548 h after admission for another cause. All information collected was treated as confidential, in strict observance of legislation on observational studies. The study was approved by the Ethics Committees of the hospitals involved. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients included in the study.",

The predictive accuracy of the influenza risk score was determined by means of the AUC [13] and its calibration was tested by the Hosmer\u2013Lemeshow test [14]. In addition, we attempted to validate the risk score by K-fold cross-validation [15, 16], which uses part of the available data to fit the model, and a different part to test it. That is, the model is validated in a random subsample which was not involved in the development of the model. This process is repeated sequentially for all partitions of the original sample. Thus, we split the data into K = 10 roughly equal-sized parts, we fitted the model with K \u2212 1 parts of the data, and validated it by predicting the remaining kth part of the data. This procedure was repeated for each Kth part, until the ten groups were all used in the validation, meaning that all cases were used once in the validation of the risk score [15].",

However, the greatest risk factors are associated with clinical factors at hospital admission, when a patient with dyspnea and confusion, and, for example, pneumonia, would have a probability of almost 30 % of developing SIHC. The main value of this predictive score is its ability to identify patients who need additional monitoring and more aggressive treatment after the first ED evaluation, either in the ICU, intermediate care units, or specialized regular wards, depending on the severity. The ED is the natural setting for the use of this severity score, but it could also be useful in outpatient services, as an adjunct to clinical judgment. It is easy and quick to apply. Patients with a score of >2 points should be taken to hospital and patients with a score of >4 points should be hospitalized on an emergency basis. However, in patients with a score of <3, the chances of severe complications would be slim and the patient could be managed at home.",

However, in accordance with other studies [3, 30], we found that obesity was not associated with a higher risk of SIHC. In fact, obesity has not been identified as a risk factor for seasonal influenza complications [31, 32]. However, the prevalence of obesity in our series was similar to that of the general Spanish population [33], while a previous Spanish study found a high prevalence of obesity in patients hospitalized for 2009 H1N1 virus infection [34]. Obese patients may have been under-represented in our sample because the recruiting process of hospitalized cases collected 25 cases in each center during the pandemic period, but without trying to be representative of all cases seen in each hospital. Further investigation is needed in order to clarify the association between obesity and severe influenza.",

However, in our series, none of the pregnant women hospitalized for 2009 H1N1 virus infection developed SIHC, similar to the results of a previous Spanish study [34] and a Canadian study [20] that did not identify pregnancy as a risk factor for ICU admission or death. Preventive measures carried out in Spain, together with a fast diagnosis, early evaluation, and early antiviral treatment, may explain the relatively low rate of severity in pregnant women infected with the influenza A (H1N1) 2009 virus.",
