The assumptions made when designing laboratory protocols to handle specimens with Ebola virus were that virus may persist for days in a specimen, body fluids may have a viral genome titer of 10E8 or higher, and as few as 1 to 10 virions may be infectious, meaning that a nanoliter of blood exposed to a mucous membrane could potentially cause disease [16], [17], [18]. As such, processes that involved open tubes, centrifugation steps, and/or aerosolization potential should be evaluated and risk mitigation steps taken when appropriate. A certified industrial hygienist can be helpful in determining risks in the laboratory, as well as potential safety engineering improvements [17]. For patients with known EVD, point-of-care testing located in a biosafety hood that minimizes specimen handling has been used with success [19]. Point-of-care testing must comply with all Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) regulations (42 CFR Part 493). In addition, testing in core hospital laboratories has been reported on specimens from patients with known EVD, as long as the instruments had closed tube sampling capability [17]. Although not available initially during the 2013-2015 outbreak, most major manufacturers now have decontamination protocols should any samples with Ebola virus be tested on an analyzer.",

ABO and Rh typing could instead be performed using commercially available reagents that are Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved for slide agglutination, a process that poses a low risk of aerosolization when performed in a biosafety hood (Fig 1A\n) [17]. Knowledge of a patient's ABO type can be helpful for selection of both convalescent and nonconvalescent blood products. Because no red blood cell (RBC) allo- or auto-antibody testing was performed, and RBC units were not serologically crossmatched, both centers provided universally compatible blood products on an emergency release basis for patients with known EVD (group O RBCs, group AB, or ABO-compatible plasma containing products if type was known) [17], [19]. The decision to forego screening for irregular RBC antibodies was not without criticism [20].",

No adverse events from receiving nonconvalescent blood products in the absence of antibody screening and serologic crossmatching were reported. However, given the small number of nonconvalescent blood transfusions, an adverse reaction may not have been statistically likely. To further improve blood transfusion safety, especially RBC transfusions, alternative technologies have been examined. For example, the CE-marked MDmulticard (Grifols, Barcelona, Spain) can rapidly serotype Rh and K subgroups by placing a drop of the patient's blood onto a card impregnated with antisera without any centrifugation, so that in the event of an emergency release RBC transfusion, antigen-compatible units could be selected to minimize the risk of immune-mediated hemolysis (Fig 1B).",

Convalescent blood products are often the only therapy readily available early on in outbreaks when no alternative licensed therapies are available. Recognition of convalescent plasma (CP) as a potential therapy for treating EVD emerged shortly after the first descriptions of Ebola in 1976-1977 when 201 units of CP from survivors were collected and stored [22]. This first EVD CP bank highlighted important challenges, namely, variable quality of the plasma product in terms of antibody titers, as well as transfusion-transmitted disease risk because most units contained filarial larvae [22].",

This changed during the 1995 Ebola outbreak centered on the city of Kikwit, when health care workers transfused convalescent whole blood from an EVD survivor into a patient with active disease [24]. The patient survived, and convalescent whole blood transfusion was administered to an additional 7 patients (Table 1) [24].

Appropriate safety testing would include serology and nucleic acid testing for transfusion-transmitted infections (TTIs), including the disease of interest as well any other additional testing needed based on donor risk factors, such as tests for Plasmodium. The risk of unusual TTI associated with CP is highlighted by studies of the first EVD CP bank, where most units contained filarial larvae [22]. Furthermore, an added layer of protection can be provided by pathogen reduction techniques, which have been reported to inactivate Ebola virus in vitro [31]. Optimal pathogen reduction techniques are those that minimally affect the therapeutic potential and yet inactivate parasites and infections not routinely tested for. In addition, transfusion-associated acute lung injury (TRALI) mitigation strategies should be considered, such as anti-HLA and antineutrophil serology. Convalescent plasma potency would optimally be assessed measuring the plasma's neutralizing antibody levels using a standardized assay that has been validated to reflect clinical benefit. The ideal CP therapy would be stored in a large bank that could support ABO-matched products with the highest potency for any patient in need.",

Therefore, because CP was evaluated by EVD treatment teams, issues that had to be considered in real-time included risks to both the donor and recipient of CP vs the potential benefits. The only guidance available to national health authorities and transfusion services to outline the necessary steps required to collect convalescent whole blood or ECP from EVD-recovered patients for transfusion to patients with early EVD, as an empirical treatment modality, was from the World Health Organization. Of particular concern in the United States was the fact that the first 2 potential CP donors were 15 and 11 days after discharge from hospitalization for EVD when collection occurred [30]. Significant unknowns regarding CP at this time included safe plasma collection volumes from the donor, determination of the quality and quantity of antibody levels, and assessment of efficacy in the recipient. In addition, whether additional infectious disease testing was needed to be performed on the CP was unknown, and at the time of the collection and transfusion of Ebola CP in the United States, no pathogen-reduction techniques were available to potentially reduce transfusion-transmitted disease risk.",

In addition, if CP were shown to be an effective therapy, concerns about the access to CP would have to be addressed given the limited supply available.

In the case reports, CP was well tolerated, with 1 patient developing respiratory complications and evaluation of possible TRALI that were possibly attributed to the plasma infusion [37]. In West Africa, the largest study of CP in EVD to date was performed in a nonrandomized, comparative study that examined the use of CP with unknown antibody titers in 99 patients [38]. Overall, no serious adverse reactions were reported with CP use, and of the 84 patients analyzed, 58 survived [38].

Looking at the studies in combination suggests that CP in EVD is a safe therapy, with only 1 reported serious adverse advent of 99 patients (Table 1).",

The criterion standard to gauge the effectiveness of CP would be a randomized controlled trial that compared CP of similar dose, timing of administration, and antibody titers to non-CP plasma infusion. Although standardizing the dose and timing of administration of CP is straightforward, determining antibody titers is not because there is no standardized assay available. Even when considering the assays used in Ebola virus research studies, variability exists in methodology, substrates, and nomenclature, making comparisons difficult. Owing to CP as a biologic product, many additional variables may affect any potential efficacy including the donor's immune response, whether the donor was infected by a similar strain of Ebola, and the epitopes recognized by the anti-Ebola antibodies. Because only GP is accessible on the virus surface, anti-GP antibodies mechanistically are more likely to be neutralizing [39]. As such, CP collected from survivors of EVD may be different from donors who were vaccinated against Ebola. Possibly, a subset of donors with high-titer neutralizing antibodies as measured by a clinically validated assay would yield CP with measurable efficacy. Given these challenges, truly meaningful conclusions regarding the value of CP remain elusive. However, as new outbreaks of infections emerge, especially with a high case-fatality rate, CP will continue to be a useful frontline tool given its favorable safety profile and ability to be rapidly deployed, which is likely to only improve with more widespread pathogen-reduction availability.",
