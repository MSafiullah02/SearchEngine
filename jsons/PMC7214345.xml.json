This became even more evident during the COVID-19 pandemic. The challenges of maintaining an effective respiratory protection program (RPP) are noted in the literature in statewide and regional evaluations.1, 2, 3 One of the problems is that healthcare workers do not use the respirators properly.2 The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) focuses on the use of N95 filtering facepiece respirators as the common tool for HCW protection from pandemic and infectious respiratory illness.4 There is a continued need for more tolerable respirator designs in healthcare,5 but innovation in this area is slow. An educational research focus on HCW behavior related to respirator use is an effective route to improve HCW safety and respiratory health at this time.",

Correct strap placement and performing a proper seal check were key behaviors noted in donning. Doffing safety behaviors included limiting touch to the respirator straps for removal and gently moving the respirator from the face to the wastebasket. These CSBST items were covered well in the CDC video, but the video did not demonstrate the conduct of hand hygiene. Prior to data analysis, each video-recorded simulation was reviewed by a member of the research team and point values were assessed using the CSBST. During the video scoring process, the research team was blinded to which educational intervention was implemented for the participants. Inter-observer agreement was assured by systematically reviewing videos independently and then comparing scores until sufficient agreement was reached. Video scoring was also randomly assessed for consistency for the videos assessed by individual scorers. No discrepancies were noted.",

The hands should not be considered clean enough to provide patient care afterwards. Removal can be complicated by several factors, but clean hands should be used for removal, and hands should be cleaned after contact with the respirator straps. Additional considerations from the video scoring might include donning location, doffing location (e.g., performed inside or outside of patient room), hair management, and facial hair status.
