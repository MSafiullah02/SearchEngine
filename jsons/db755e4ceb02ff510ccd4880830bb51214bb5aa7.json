Singh, Urban Health and Wellbeing, Advances in Geographical and Environmental Sciences, https://doi.org/10.1007/978-981-13-6671-0_8 251 India presently is the second-largest populated nation comprising of 18% of the world's population (United Nations 2017) . This is approximately combined population of the six countries, namely the USA, Indonesia, Brazil, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Japan (Patel 2015) . However, with large human resource base comes many inherent challenges. India is bearing the dual burden of diseases where on the lower end, malnutrition, hygiene, immunization, sanitation and infectious diseases are major concerns; and on the higher end, environmental health and lifestyle diseases and other non-communicable diseases have raised alarm. Cardiovascular diseases, tuberculosis, cancer, diabetics, malaria, dengue fever, chikungunya, respiratory infections, vector and water-borne diseases continue to be major challenges among the latter group (Central Bureau of Health Intelligence 2016). Added to this is the threat of emerging infectious disease like Ebola, SARS and H1N1 influenza virus-related diseases. As per the Central Bureau of Health Intelligence (2016), India is facing the 'Triple burden of diseases', i.e., unfinished agenda of communicable diseases, noncommunicable diseases and emerging infectious diseases. Among the communicable diseases, in 2015, morbidity reported from acute respiratory infections was the highest (67%) followed by acute diarrhoeal diseases (23%), whereas mortality reported was highest from influenza A H1N1 (23%), acute respiratory infections (20%) and pneumonia (18%) (Central Bureau of Health Intelligence 2016). Hence, the concern of the future decade is not only population increase and composition but also quality of human resource.",

With the liberalization of health insurance, there has been an increase in the private player, but, still 74% of the insurance falls under various Governmentsponsored schemes.

Break-up of public and private spending reveals that 26.20% and 73.80%, respectively, were the contribution. This is highly skewed and the public sector spending is lowest in comparison with USA (45.5%), UK (81.70%), Brazil (41.60) and China (44.70%). On the other hand, the private sector contribution is highest in India while the global average is 40.40% (2010). The per capita spending on health care is also among lowest in India (40 USD). However, it is notable to see that the healthcare industry is growing in India owing to population increase, expected increase in geriatric population, lifestyle-related diseases, rising literacy and disposable income that makes health care more affordable.",

Herein, detailed plan for National Health Service with universal coverage was envisaged. The Bhore Committee presented a detailed analysis of the present situation with suggestions. Further, the Sokhey Committee (established in 1938) report was released in 1948. This was a sketchy report as compared the Bhore Committee report. Nevertheless, the recommendations of both concurred. Unfortunately, the health disparity and coverage of health services still remain grave. In post-independence, it was not until 1983 when the first health policy was formulated and adopted. But before 1983, schemes made under the Five Year Plans were fulfilled. These had specific targets like, in the 1950s and the 1960s, the focus was on managing the epidemics. Widespread national-level campaigns were started to overcome the loss by malaria, smallpox, tuberculosis, leprosy, filaria, cholera and others. The approach was techno-centric wherein the health workers were trained to prevent and control disease spread. International experts and ideologies influenced the mission. The necessary chemicals, medicines and vaccines were dependent on international agencies. The role of social and economic conditions, environment, diet, nutrition, housing and clothing was ignored. Moreover, the structure of public healthcare delivery system remained unchanged in first two Five Year Plans and urban areas continued to receive major share of resources. By the end of second plan, there was one Primary Health Unit per 140,000 rural populations (14 times less as per Bhore Committee recommendation) and one hospital for 320,000 rural populations. On the contrary, in urban areas, the ratio for hospital and dwellers was 1:36,000 and 1:440 for hospital bed per population. Clearly, the health disparities were quite high and needed urgent attention. Murlidhar Committee was set up in 1959 to evaluate the progress made in the first two plans and provide recommendations. Though there were success stories with regard to the control of disease-specific deaths, improvements in life expectancy and reduction in death rate; the committee bought forward the issues of availability and accessibility to healthcare services. The primary health centres (PHC) were understaffed and ill-equipped, the health practitioners were less in number and urgent need to improve healthcare facilities was asserted (Sharma 2017 ). Subsequently, the Third Five Year Plan proposed the establishment of medical colleges, research institutes and training centres for doctors, nurses and auxiliary staff. Though the family planning programme started in 1951, it was actively pursued in this period. Additionally, family planning was made an independent department in the Ministry of health. Thereafter, in 1969, the fourth plan was released that continued the previous approach and goals. Other than this, water supply and sanitation were given separate allocations under the sector of Housing and Regional development.",

The provision of safe drinking water and sanitation remained inadequate or absent in majority of the areas. Many waterborne diseases such as diarrhoea, cholera, typhoid, jaundice and others affected the Indian population. Later in 1979-80, India faced with acute drought.

Emphasis was laid on preventive, promotive and rehabilitative primary health care; decentralization and community participation and increased role of private investors. Due to attention on selective health care, increased privatization and delink with the ground realities, the policy could not make much success stories.
