Volumetric CT thorax images for lung and soft tissue have been investigated in the recent studies for identifying COVID-19 [10, 12] .

Deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) are one of the powerful deep learning architectures and have been widely applied in many practical applications such as pattern recognition and image classification in an intuitive way [30] . DCNNs are able to handle four manners as follow [31] : 1) training the neural network weights on very large available datasets; 2) fine-tuning the network weights of a pre-trained DCNN based on small datasets; 3) Applying unsupervised pre-training to initialize the network weights before putting DCNN models in an application; and 4) using pre-trained DCNN is also called an off-theshelf CNN being used as a feature extractor. In previous studies, DCNNs have been exploited in X-ray image classification to successfully diagnose common chest diseases such as Tuberculosis screening [32] and mediastinal lymph nodes in CT images [33] . However, the application of deep learning techniques to identify and detect novel COVID-19 in X-ray is still very limited so far. Therefore, the aim of this study to propose a new framework of pre-trained deep learning classifiers; namely COVIDX-Net as an advanced tool to assist radiologists to automatically diagnose COVID-19 in X-ray images.

The training parameters for all DCNNs architectures in this study are: The learning rate = e \u22123 , the values of batch size and number of epochs are set to 7 and 50, respectively, to achieve the desired convergence with few iterations on this small X-ray image dataset, and also to avoid the degradation problem as possible. All deep network classifiers are trained using Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) because of its good converge and fast running time. Image data augmentation was not used in this study. Table 2 Table. 2. In addition, the values of performance metrics of each deep learning classifier are presented in Table 3 . The highest precision of deep learning classifier to detect only positive COVID-19 was achieved by ResNetV2, InceptionResNetV2, Xception, and MobileNetV2, but their corresponding performances were worst to classify the normal cases correctly. Therefore, we recommend the VGG19 and DenseNet201 models to be applied for in the CAD systems to identify the health status of patients against the COVID-19 in X-ray images. Fig. 3 depicts the graphical performance evaluation of all trained deep learning classifiers with accuracy and cross-entropy loss (loss) in the training and validation step. The best scores of training and validation accuracy were achieved for VGG19 and DenseNet201 models, and the worst case is resulted by the InceptionV3, as illustrated also in Table 3 . The resulted confusion matrices of all tested deep learning classifiers are depicted in Fig. 4 . Furthermore, our results added the Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) curves to verify the classification performances of each deep learning classifier by showing the true positive rate (TPR) against the false positive rate (FPR) to identify the positive COVID-19 cases in the tested X-ray images. Infectious COVID-19 disease shocked the world and is still threating the lives of billions of people. In this study, a new CVOIDX-Net framework has been proposed to automatically identify or confirm COVID-19 in 2-D X-ray images based on seven deep learning classifiers; namely VGG19, DenseNet121, ResNetV2, InceptionV3, InceptionResNetV2, Xception, and MobileNetV2. The results of our proposed COVIDX-Net verified that the best performance scores of deep learning classifiers are for the VGG19 and DenseNet201models. Furthermore, the performance of the MobileNetV2 can be further improved to be used on smart devices because of its high computational speed in the healthcare sector to assist the accurate cost-effective of COVID-19 in X-ray images and maybe later used for CT imaging modality in our future work of this highly important research topic.",

The most reliable model is the best but it is important to ensure that there are symmetrical datasets with almost equal false positive values and false adverse values. Therefore, the above components of the confusion matrix must be calculated to assess the classification quality Precision: Precision is represented in(2)to give relationship between the true positive predicted values and full positive predicted values. ) Recall: In (3), recall or sensitivity is the ratio between the true positive values of prediction and the summation of predicted true positive values and predicted false negative values.
