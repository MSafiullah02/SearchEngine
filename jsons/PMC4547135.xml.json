The diagnostic distribution was as follows: PC (n = 4), TS (n = 5), and DK (n = 3). PC was identified through plasma and urinary catecholamines and metanephrines testing and imaging confirmation of adrenal lesions compatible with pheochromocytoma. TS was diagnosed on the basis of serum thyroid hormone levels and traditional signs and symptoms of a thyrotoxic state. The diagnosis of DK was made in presence of uncontrolled hyperglycemia, metabolic acidosis, and increased total blood ketone concentrations, either with or without a history of type 1 diabetes mellitus. The following variables were collected in all participants: age, sex, initial clinical presentation, final diagnosis, time taken to identify the etiology, initial sepsis-related organ failure assessment (SOFA) score17, ECMO duration, pre- and post-ECMO inotropic equivalent (IE = dopamine \u00d7 1 + dobutamine \u00d7 1 + norepinephrine \u00d7 100 + epinephrine \u00d7 100, all expressed in \u03bcg/kg/min), post-ECMO blood pressure values, biochemical data, hormone levels, and length of stay in the intensive care unit. The main outcome measures included neurological conditions at discharge, survival, duration of ECMO, and the occurrence of complications after ECMO. Because the clinical presentation of several patients with endocrine emergencies closely resembled AMI, we compared their general characteristics and outcomes with those of 80 cases with AMI (aged \u226465 years) who received ECMO because of cardiogenic shock.",

The presentation of PC mimicked AMI with palpitations, chest pain, abnormal electrocardiographic findings, and elevations of cardiac enzymes (Tables 1 and 2). Not surprisingly, most patients with PC were initially misdiagnosed as having an acute coronary syndrome. Three PC patients (PC-1, PC-2, and PC-4) had a bystander-witnessed out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and ECMO was initiated during cardiac pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) in the emergency department. Patient PC-3 presented with an intractable cardiogenic shock requiring ECMO to allow for organ recovery. Paroxysmal hypertension was identified in all of these patients following ECMO implantation. All of the patients in the PC group underwent coronary angiography. Patients PC-1, PC-2, and PC-3 had normal coronary angiography, which led to the suspicion of pheochromocytoma. Because of a 50% stenosis in the left circumflex artery, patient PC-4 was initially treated as having an AMI and weaned off ECMO support after 48 h under stable hemodynamic conditions. An episode of pulseless ventricular tachycardia occurred 2 h later, requiring resumption of CPR and ECMO. Because of the extreme blood pressure fluctuations, a diagnosis of PC was suspected. Patients PC-1 and PC-3 experienced a severe lower leg compartment syndrome despite placement of a distal perfusion catheter to prevent limb ischemia. In patient PC-1, the femoral-femoral VA ECMO was converted to a central ECMO after median sternotomy avoiding further worsening of limb ischemia. Patient PC-3 underwent a below-knee amputation of the left leg. The patients received abdominal computed tomography scans to localize the tumor and confirm the diagnosis. All PC patients underwent adrenalectomy after discharge from the intensive care unit, the only exception being PC-4 who refused surgery.",

Hyperbilirubinemia was evident in all of the TS patients, whereas patient TS-2 and TS-4 developed massive gastrointestinal bleeding. Under ECMO support and anti-thyroid drug therapy, the cardiac function of four of the 5 TS patients started recovering between day 3 and day 4. They were subsequently weaned off ECMO. Patient TS-1 died of multi-organ failure while receiving ECMO, whereas patient TS-2 eventually died of liver failure.

Patient DK-3 required ECMO because of profound hypothermia and hypotension unresponsive to aggressive fluid replacement and high-dose catecholamine administration. The presence of uncontrolled hyperglycemia, metabolic acidosis, and increased total blood ketone concentrations led to a diagnosis of DK. Because patient DK-1 was also diagnosed with community-acquired pneumonia that progressed to acute respiratory distress syndrome, both VA and VV ECMO support were indicated. VA and VV ECMO were stopped 200 h and 381 h after initiation, respectively. The patient eventually developed gangrene of the distal parts of all four limbs and died of septic shock and multiple organ failure.

AMI patients required higher doses of inotropic agents to stabilize their hemodynamic status and their left ventricular ejection function remained poor. The ECMO weaning success rates for patients with AMI and endocrine emergencies were 70% and 83%, respectively. Patients with AMI required the following subsequent interventions: coronary bypass surgery (n = 26), repair of a ruptured ventricular septal defect (n = 4), implantation of a left ventricular assist device (n = 3), cardiorrhaphy following removal of ECMO, and heart transplantation (n = 1). The neurological outcomes did not differ significantly between the two groups.

A total of 12 cases were identified in our registry from 2005 to 2012, indicating that the incidence of endocrine emergencies is low but not negligible. Pheochromocytoma has been estimated to be present in approximately 0.3% of all patients undergoing evaluation for secondary causes of hypertension18. Moreover, TS and DK accounts for 2% and 8.6% of all hospital admissions in patients with thyrotoxicosis and type 1 diabetes mellitus, respectively1920. In general, endocrine emergencies can have a rapid and aggressive clinical course and pose significant diagnostic challenges (because they can mimic either AMI or acute congestive heart failure). Endocrine emergencies are not common and probably misdiagnosed in many cases, and the clinical value of ECMO support in their clinical management remains unclear. Notably, following our report of a patient with PC who was successfully rescued by ECMO in January 20089, seven additional cases were described (a finding that illustrates the magnitude of the potential underestimation as well as a recent increase in awareness)10111213141516.",

However, two of the four patients with PC (50%) developed limb ischemia, a percentage which was significantly higher than those observed in both the DK (one patient, 33%) and AMI (six patients, 7.5%) groups (Table 3). To our knowledge, a total of 12 cases of pheochromocytoma-associated peripheral limb ischemia have been reported to date21.
