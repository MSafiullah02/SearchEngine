At the onset of the epidemic, the community consisted of 56 chimpanzees <1 week\u201256.9 years of age. All Kanyawara chimpanzees are individually identifiable and habituated to human observers, such that trained field assistants collected direct data on behavior and respiratory signs daily. We compiled these data into weekly measures of clinical signs (coughing or sneezing, further classified as mild or severe) and deaths. During June\u2012August 2013, we collected fecal samples from 41 chimpanzees. Immediately after observing defecation by a chimpanzee, we placed 5 mL of the fecal sample into an equal volume of RNAlater buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), homogenized the mixture, and stored the sample at \u221220\u00b0C for up to 3 months, until export to the United States.",

The postmortem analysis revealed ecchymotic hemorrhages on the lung surfaces, consolidation of the parenchyma of both lungs (approximately two thirds of both lungs affected), mucoid exudate in the bronchi, hepatomegaly, and hepatic congestion. On the basis of these findings, the cause of death was concluded to be severe acute pneumonia. Deep sequencing of swab samples from this chimpanzee\u2019s oropharynx, trachea, and lung yielded 10,722,035 sequence reads, of which 8,918 had high similarity to rhinovirus C. No other pathogens were detected. Subsequent qPCR confirmed infection with RV-C, with viral loads of 7.41 \u00d7 106 copies/swab in the oropharynx, 1.05 \u00d7 107 copies/swab in the trachea, and 1.74 \u00d7 106 copies/swab in the lung; these values are comparable to the average viral load (7.76 \u00d7 106 copies/mL) found in rhinovirus C\u2012infected children with acute wheezing illness treated in an emergency department (27). Further sequencing yielded a near-complete rhinovirus C genome consisting of a complete polyprotein gene of 6,450 bases, a complete 3\u2032 untranslated region (UTR) of 35 bases excluding the poly(A) tail, and a partial 5\u2032-UTR of 480 bases. The viral polyprotein sequence was 94.59% similar at the nucleic acid level and 99.99% similar at the amino acid level to its closest known relative, a rhinovirus C45 sequence (GenBank accession no. JN837686) from a 2-month-old male patient who had a history of mild nasal congestion and discharge in the United States in 2000. RDP4 analyses showed the chimpanzee-derived sequence to be a rhinovirus C45-C11 recombinant, with a breakpoint in the 5\u2032-UTR (Figure 2). In phylogenetic analyses, the virus clustered within known rhinovirus C genotypes, appearing as a sister taxon to the reference rhinovirus C45 isolate (Figure 3). The chimpanzee-derived strain was designated RV-C45-cpz1-2013 to indicate its presumptive serotype and discovery in a chimpanzee in 2013 (GenBank accession no. KY624849).",

Indeed, rhinoviruses often recombine; the parent strains of RV-C45-cpz1-2013 and the genomic location of the recombination event are similar to those described previously (3). RV-C45-cpz1-2013 also shares with other rhinovirus C variants the capacity to infect the lower respiratory tract and cause severe disease.

For example, during 47 years of wild chimpanzee observation in Gombe, Tanzania, respiratory disease accounted for 48% of illness-related deaths and was the predominant cause of lethal illness in this population (40). When noninvasive diagnoses were attempted in other populations, human paramyxoviruses were sometimes implicated (11\u201314). However, rhinovirus C could have been missed in outbreaks for which the cause was never identified. Standard molecular diagnostics for rhinoviruses might have failed to detect rhinovirus C, which is genetically divergent from rhinoviruses A and B (28). Furthermore, rhinoviruses are adapted to the respiratory tract and are acid sensitive, such that virions dissociate below pH 6.0 (41). Because of this property, rhinoviruses are unlikely to survive gastrointestinal transit, and their nucleic acids are unlikely to be found in feces, except during acute and fulminant infections (42). Noninvasive diagnostics of ape respiratory disease outbreaks might, therefore, be inherently limited in detecting rhinoviruses, which is unfortunate given that the remote locations in which these endangered apes live often preclude invasive diagnostics (12).",

All adenoviruses sequenced from fecal samples were similar or identical to adenoviruses that have been documented in apparently healthy wild chimpanzees and other primates (32,34,35,43). Finally, clinical signs during the chimpanzee outbreak bore a striking resemblance to those caused by rhinovirus C in susceptible humans, and epidemiologic transmission parameter estimates were consistent with the common cold in human populations (39). Nevertheless, we cannot rule out adenoviruses or other undetected co-infecting agents as contributing factors because such infections can enhance the clinical severity of rhinovirus C (1). In this regard, we note that simian immunodeficiency virus, which can cause immunodeficiency in wild chimpanzees (44), was not detected and is thought to be absent from this chimpanzee population (45).",

Kibale National Park, wherein the home range of the Kanyawara community lies, is frequented by researchers, tourists, and persons living at the periphery of the park, and chimpanzees sometimes leave the park to raid crops in local villages. Accordingly, myriad pathways exist by which the Kanyawara chimpanzees could have been exposed to rhinovirus C from humans. Current guidelines for visiting wild apes in Uganda and other countries are based in part on generalized risks for respiratory disease transmission from humans (e.g., quarantine periods for arriving travelers are mandated at Kanyawara) (46). We suggest that specific consideration of rhinovirus C and its particular biologic attributes might improve such guidelines. For example, rhinovirus virions are nonenveloped and might therefore persist in the environment for extended periods of time, even maintaining infectivity after desiccation (47).",

Wrangham, unpub. data). Observations also suggest that respiratory disease outbreaks have occurred in other chimpanzee communities in Kibale at the same times as outbreaks in the Kanyawara community. Kibale contains \u22481,500 chimpanzees in \u224810\u201320 interconnected communities; that such a population could sustain rhinovirus C or other similar infectious agents in cycles of within-group and between-group transmission is possible, at least for limited time periods (39). If respiratory viruses of human origin can circulate independently in wild chimpanzee populations of sufficient size, this fact would be troublesome not only for chimpanzee conservation but also for human health, in that chimpanzees could also serve as a reservoir for human infections.",

Similarly, proper hygiene and the use of hand sanitizer effectively reduce the amounts of rhinovirus on human fingers (49). Decades ago, captive chimpanzees were used as study subjects in biomedical research intended to evaluate putative rhinovirus prevention and treatment options (36,37,50). Our results suggest that these investigations could ultimately benefit the wild relatives of the chimpanzees that were the original subjects of these laboratory experimentations. We advocate building upon existing data to engineer novel interventions and prevention strategies for rhinovirus infections in both humans and wild apes.",
