Moreover, sequential HRV infections caused by different HRV genotypes have been described as a common event in healthy subjects [3], [5], [23], [24], [26]. In contrast, HRV-PIs are infrequent events and have been reported only in immunocompromised patients such as lung transplant [14], HSCT recipients [13], [15], or patients with hypogammaglobulinaemia [24], [27]. Interestingly, HRV-PIs were associated with the prolonged shedding of a single HRV genotype suggesting the lack of efficient immunologic control of an initial HRV infection event. In the present retrospective study, HRV-PIs (\u226530 days) were observed in eight pediatric HSCT recipients representing a small fraction of all HSCT recipients [1.5%]. In agreement with previous observations [15], [16], [23], [26], also in our study, HRV-PIs were sustained by a single HRV genotype in all patients. The distribution of HRV species in HRV-PI and HRV-AI in this study reflects the worldwide HRV circulation, with HRV-A and HRV-C as the more prevalent HRV species observed [4], [5], [6], [7].",

            "text": "In this and previous reports, where HRV-PIs have all been recorded in immunocompromised patients [13], [15], [16], [28] the role of B- or T-cell immunity in controlling HRV-PI is unclear. Peltola et al. recently documented that intravenous immunoglobulin therapy does not effectively correct the defective clearance of HRV in patients with primary hypogammaglobulinaemia [24]. In accordance, our results demonstrate the presence of HRV-PI in HSCT recipients receiving intravenous immunoglobulin replacement therapy, thus suggesting that impaired T cell-mediated immunity may have contributed to delayed HRV clearance. Similarly, Gooskens et al. reported that impaired T cell-mediated immunity correlated with delayed elimination of the influenza virus in HSCT recipients [29]. In the present study, HSCT recipients with HRV-PI had absent or very low T-CD4+, T-CD8+ and NK lymphocyte counts during induction and before transplant engraftment, moreover T-CD4+, T-CD8+ and NK lymphocyte counts at the time of infection onset were significantly lower than those observed in HSCT recipients with HRV-AI. T-CD4+, T-CD8+ and NK lymphocyte counts were also significantly lower at the onset of infection with respect to the time of HRV clearance in patients with HRV-PI, and inversely correlated with HRV load. These findings also suggest that the peak HRV load at the onset of infection is an independent factor with respect to the immunological status of the patient. Finally, there was no significant difference in the T-CD4+, T-CD8+ and NK lymphocyte counts between HSCT recipients with HRV-AI and those with HRV-PI at the time of infection resolution. This finding suggests that the reconstitution of cell-mediated immunity might be crucial for complete virus clearance. Nevertheless, our study has some limitations, including the absence of virus-specific immunological analyses, the small number of cases studied and the retrospective nature of design. As HRV-PIs are infrequent events, further investigations on large cohorts are needed to clarify the respective role of innate, T cell-mediated and humoral immunity in the clearance of HRV infections.",

In a recent study involving adult HSCT recipients, HRV was recognized as a significant cause of pneumonia [10]. Of note, in this study, an adult patient acquiring HRV infection during pre-transplant conditioning had persistent URTI and HRV positivity (3 months) [10]. This is consistent with our finding that in five HSCT recipients, HRV infection was acquired in the pre-transplant period; these subjects suffered only from mild URTI with no major clinical complications. However, in pediatric HSCT recipients the risk for development of LRTI cannot be excluded.",
