Aseptic surgery and barrier nursing had shown the importance of contact in hospital infection. It was thought that respiratory infections were transmitted by large droplets over short distances or through contact with freshly contaminated surfaces; not via the air, or dust.11 Natural cross-ventilation remained popular in hospitals, however, with open-air management of tuberculosis patients having a direct influence on hospital design.15\n",

This eroded the importance of ventilation as an infection control strategy. Rather than construct buildings to prevent infection, the aim was to create comfortable conditions and remove odours produced by building occupants. Standards based on comfort remained in place until the 1973 Oil Embargo, when energy efficiency became a priority.16 There was increased use of recirculated air, particularly in commercial buildings. Air change rates were reduced to save fuel and money. The latter may have contributed towards so-called \u2018sick building syndrome\u2019, characterized by a range of symptoms including headache, fatigue, dry eyes and throat, nasal congestion and dry skin.16, 17\n",

For example, \u2018contact\u2019 may be used to indicate inhalation of large droplets from contagious individuals when they cough or sneeze, i.e. droplet transmission, but \u2018contact\u2019 may also refer to infectious particles transmitted directly from contaminated surfaces.29 Aside from particle size, the potential for transmission depends upon dynamic factors, such as number of particles produced; velocity at which they are produced; number of micro-organisms contained within the spectrum of droplet sizes; infectious longevity of those microbes; and proximity of a susceptible target.9, 30\n",

Smaller respiratory droplets quickly evaporate, leaving residues which, in turn, become minute suspended particles or \u2018droplet nuclei\u2019.32 By contrast with larger droplets, these smaller particles can stay airborne for minutes to hours depending on size and density. Their size means that they could potentially penetrate deeper into lung tissues than droplets.9 Droplet nuclei are also exhaled during normal breathing and talking, although the number of particles exhaled during breathing and conversation are many orders of magnitude fewer than the aerosols produced by coughing or sneezing.9, 33\n",

Another incident occurred in 1971 when a naval scientist contracted smallpox while offshore from a smallpox testing site in Kazakhstan.55 The virus travelled downwind over a distance of at least 15 km to reach the ship. This raised concerns that scientists in the former Soviet Union not only \u2018weaponized\u2019 smallpox, but succeeded in aerosolizing it. Further evidence for airborne transmission of smallpox came in 1978 when a medical photographer contracted the disease and died.56 The virus is thought to have dispersed via air currents up a service duct from a laboratory to the room where the victim worked.",

A sick person can produce 107 virus particles per millilitre of vomit whilst faecal material contains up to 1012 viruses per gram.27 Projectile vomiting is likely to be a major source of cross-infection and droplets generated by flushing toilets can be inhaled or deposited on surfaces.27, 70 The high attack rates seen during norovirus outbreaks could be due to rapid dispersal via aerosols.71, 72\n",

There is evidence that sharing office space increases the risk of catching a cold.74 A study in mechanically ventilated office buildings found additional evidence for aerosol transmission of rhinovirus, when a low outdoor air supply resulted in an increased risk of inhaling infectious droplets.75 A more recent study found that students accommodated in six-person rooms were twice as likely to have colds as students in three-person rooms.76 Some 35% of students caught more than six colds each year when the ventilation rate was 1 L/s/person. If this rate was increased to 5 L/s/person, the number of students catching colds six times or more fell to 5%, suggesting that there was an association between colds and outdoor-to-indoor air flow rates; this reflects the multifactorial nature of the spread of such respiratory infections. There is evidence that hand-to-surface contacts are of greater significance, at least for respiratory syncytial virus.77 Nevertheless, ventilation may still be important in diluting and dispersing virus-laden droplets than is currently appreciated.78\n",

Improved housing is one of a number of factors thought to explain the decline of tuberculosis in Britain from the mid-19th century onwards.79 Since tuberculosis is mainly contracted through airborne droplets, it follows that transmission of M. tuberculosis to a non-infected person is more likely if there is overcrowding and poor ventilation.80 Anyone who lives and sleeps in the same household as an infected person is at risk. Similarly, there is greater risk of contracting the disease in confined environments such as prisons, homeless shelters and long-term care facilities.20 Studies on ventilation issues and transmission risk of tuberculosis in private houses have received little attention, in company with most other respiratory infections.81 Statistics from the USA in 2002 put the healthcare costs of building-influenced communicable respiratory infections, including tuberculosis, at US$10 billion.78\n",

Whereas this effect persisted in well-ventilated dark spaces, tubercles retained their infectivity for long periods in the absence of fresh air or confined air.106 In the 1960s, the lethality of outside air to micro-organisms was rediscovered and the term \u2018open air factor\u2019 (OAF) was introduced.107, 108 Further research showed that this ephemeral property of outdoor air had an adverse effect on viability and virulence of airborne micro-organisms, including influenza and the Category IV pathogen, Francisella tularensis.109, 110 These natural disinfection characteristics of outdoor air were then ignored for more than two decades.36\n",

The time depended on the thickness of the layer of bacteria exposed. Furthermore, ordinary diffuse daylight, such as is found near windows in houses, could kill the bacterium in five to seven days.142 Even before this, it was recognized that tuberculosis transmission was less likely to occur in clean, well-lit, well-ventilated houses or hospitals.106\n",

In 1944, two linked studies showed that virulent organisms were recovered from a range of surfaces one week or more after drying and storing in a cupboard.155, 156 Meningococci were then exposed to different intensities of natural light. Direct sunlight passing through an ordinary window killed the organisms within a few hours, with less effect from diffuse daylight through a north-facing window. During cloudy weather, meningococci died more rapidly near a window than 12 feet away. Tests with coloured filters showed that whereas red light had little impact on meningococcal viability, blue light was highly bactericidal. Lethality of light transmitted by coloured filters of orange, green and yellow was proportional to the amount of blue light each filter transmitted.156 None of this work has since been repeated.",

Since radiant sources heat internal surfaces rather than air, comfortable conditions can be maintained at lower air temperatures.192 The potential for energy savings and the health benefits of radiant heating have been overlooked in recent years.191 When Florence Nightingale set out to create healthy indoor environments, she insisted on radiant heat in sick rooms because she felt that air heated by metal surfaces was unhealthy. As she put it: \u2018To shut your patients tight in artificially warmed air is to bake them in a slow oven.\u20193 She believed that combining warm-air heating and mechanical ventilation was especially harmful because it prevented or delayed recovery.",

Any increase in fuel costs would be offset by the reduction in treatment time for patients.3 Later, during the 1920s, the British physiologist Sir Leonard Hill reported that the human body requires the stimulus of a constantly changing environment; and that monotonous over-warm indoor conditions are harmful. In common with Nightingale, he recommended sunlight, fresh air and radiant heating.193 Detailed research on indoor air quality and other health factors in today\u2019s energy-efficient buildings is lacking.194 Present-day buildings may perform better in energy terms than older designs, but the exclusion of sunlight and fresh air could encourage poor health and associated costs.",
