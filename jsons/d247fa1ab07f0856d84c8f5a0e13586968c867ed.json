The story of SARS illustrates vividly some NOS features advocated in the school science curriculum, including the tentative nature of scientific knowledge, theory-laden observation and interpretation, multiplicity of approaches adopted in scientific inquiry, the inter-relationship between science and technology, and the nexus of science, politics, social and cultural practices. The story also provided some insights into a number of NOS features less emphasised in the school curriculum-for example, the need to combine and coordinate expertise in a number of scientific fields, the intense competition between research groups (suspended during the SARS crisis), the significance of affective issues relating to intellectual honesty and the courage to challenge authority, the pressure of funding issues on the conduct of research and the 'peace of mind' of researchers, These less emphasised elements provided empirical evidence that NOS knowledge, like scientific knowledge itself, changes over time. They reflected the need for teachers and curriculum planners to revisit and reconsider whether the features of NOS currently included in the school science curriculum are fully reflective of the practice of science in the 21st century. In this paper, we also report on how we made use of extracts from the news reports and documentaries on SARS, together with episodes from the scientists' interviews, to develop a multimedia instructional package for explicitly teaching the prominent features of NOS and scientific inquiry identified in the SARS research.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Understanding the nature of science (NOS), especially the key features of the scientific endeavour, has long been regarded as a major component of science literacy and an important objective of science curricula in many countries (e.g. American Association for the Advancement of Science 1993; Council of Ministers of Education 1997; Millar and Osborne 1998) 1 However, it has been consistently reported that many students, and even many teachers, do not possess adequate NOS understanding (Lederman 1992; Abd-El-Khalick and Lederman 2000; Moss et al. 2001; Finson 2002) . While there have been many attempts to improve teachers' understanding of NOS, Abd-El-Khalick and Lederman (2000) report that little success has been achieved. Their critical review suggests that 'approaches that utilise elements from history and philosophy of science and/or direct instruction on NOS are more effective in achieving that end than approaches that utilise science process-skills instruction or non-reflective inquiry-based activities ' (p. 694) . The authors also point out that while there might be compelling theoretical arguments to support the effectiveness of history of science and philosophy of science in improving learners' NOS conceptions, further empirical research is essential. Among research efforts in this direction, Irwin (2000) demonstrates encouraging results with a group of 14-yearold students by integrating substantial amounts of historical material into the topic of Atoms and the Periodic Table. Lin and Chen (2002) also provide empirical evidence of positive impact on understanding of NOS among a group of prospective chemistry teachers by integrating historical cases into a pre-service teacher education programme. Bell et al. (2003) and Schwartz et al. (2004) have investigated the effectiveness of promoting NOS understanding among high school students and pre-service teachers by providing the authentic research experience of working with practicing scientists. Results show that better understanding of NOS and the nature of scientific inquiry do not necessarily result from doing science per se (Bell et al. 2003) . There also need to be frequent opportunities for reflection on NOS in the context of that authentic scientific research experience through journal writing and seminars (Schwartz et al. 2004 ). In their recent comparison of the epistemic beliefs of chemistry students and research chemists, Samarapungavan et al. (2006) come to the broadly similar conclusion that apprenticeship experiences are no automatic guarantee of epistemic development in students. They suggest that engaging students and expert researchers in conversation and reflection on epistemic issues related to research work will have a greater chance of success.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 490, "end": 505, "text": "(Lederman 1992;", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 506, "end": 539, "text": "Abd-El-Khalick and Lederman 2000;", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 540, "end": 557, "text": "Moss et al. 2001;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 558, "end": 570, "text": "Finson 2002)", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 671, "end": 686, "text": "Lederman (2000)", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 1023, "end": 1033, "text": "' (p. 694)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1322, "end": 1334, "text": "Irwin (2000)", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1510, "end": 1529, "text": "Lin and Chen (2002)", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 1733, "end": 1751, "text": "Bell et al.

Our response has been to present students with insight into authentic scientific practice through the development of a case study of contemporary scientific practice. A detailed review of 17 experimental studies of context-based or STS-oriented approaches at secondary school level by Bennett et al. (2007) indicates that such approaches have positive impact on students' understanding of scientific concepts and attitudes to science and school science, especially when attention focuses on recent scientific research and innovations. While none of these studies focused specifically on NOS understanding, there is good reason to anticipate similarly favourable learning outcomes with respect to learning about science and scientific inquiry. Indeed, there are compelling arguments that critical consideration of socioscientific issues provides an ideal forum for students to deploy and develop their NOS understanding (Sadler 2004; Sadler and Zeidler 2005; Zeidler et al. 2005) , especially when the issues are controversial (Kolstoe 2000; Oulton et al. 2004) or have strong personal relevance (Ryder 2002) . Khishfe and Lederman (2006) remind us that although locating NOS teaching within controversial topics (in their case, discussion of global warming) can be effective, the essential requirement, as in internship and apprenticeship approaches, is that NOS teaching is both explicit and supportive of critical reflection. The case study described here focuses on an episode that was intensely personal for our students and had many controversial aspects. Moreover, the learning materials were designed to draw explicit attention to important NOS items and to encourage reflection.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 537, "end": 558, "text": "Bennett et al.
