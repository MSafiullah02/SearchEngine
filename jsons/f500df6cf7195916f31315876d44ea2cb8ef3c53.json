We explored how elderly, young and middle-aged individuals and children resourced information and how they adapted their information behavior to emerging online technologies. Two information resource orchestration practices (information resourcing activities and information behavior adaptation activities) and three mechanisms (online emergence and convergence in community resilience, the J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 2 overcoming of information flow impediments, and the application of absorptive capacity) were identified in the study.",

With this study, we respond to the call issued by fellow information scientists to take action and contribute to the understanding of information crises during global health crises (Xie, et al., 2020) . In particular, we investigate the information behavior of six Chinese families who were part of the recent two-month community lockdown. As is well known, in the last three months, lockdowns have been part of the social distancing strategy deployed across the globe to slow the rapidly spreading disease. In this paper, we argue that an in-depth understanding of citizens' information behavior during lockdowns will help global citizens survive the COVID-19 pandemic, deal with the aftermath, and be better prepared for future crises.",

The need for individuals (citizens under lockdown) to adapt to a new information environment is crucial to surviving the pandemic. First and foremost, citizens under lockdown have to find new sources of information, as previous information sources are unlikely to be crisis-centric or relevant to essential needs during a community lockdown. In a lockdown, citizens are physically isolated in their own homes and are often given very little time to prepare before the commencement of the lockdown order. Second, J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f citizens have to expeditiously adapt to emerging online technologies (for living needs, communication, and work/education purposes) so that they are better informed, connected, and even protected from a public health standpoint (Roy, et al., 2020) .",

To date, this topic has been a mystery, which results in citizens having to deal with uncertainties and fears during difficult periods. Therefore, as governments have ordered lockdowns and prescribed these lockdowns as the primary social distancing strategy to combat the virus, both the interaction between people and information and the interaction between people and information technologies have been characterized by significant challenges. With millions of global citizens currently being isolated in their homes, frustrations are strongly felt by all age groups in different socioeconomic classes. Against this backdrop, we adopt a resource orchestration perspective to study information behavior with the following research question: How is information resourced by citizens, and as a result, how should they adapt to emerging online information technologies during a community lockdown?",

It is widely recognized that information has a crucial role in disaster management activities (Chen, et al., 2008; Van de Walle & Turoff, 2007; Pan, Pan & Leinder, 2012) due to these activities' information-intensive nature. To cope with uncertainty, people seek information (Allen, 2011; Wilson, 1999) to mitigate tensions and anxiety and become informed about the disaster response (Yang and Hsieh 2013) . Therefore, the relevant literature has focused primarily on investigating the information seeking and sharing behavior (Rahmi, Joho & Shirai, 2019) (Allen, et al., 2019; Allen, Karanasios, & Slavova, 2011) in computerized settings. Social media refers to a group of Internetbased applications that build on the ideological and technological foundations of Web 2.0 and allow the creation and exchange of user-generated content (Roy, et al., 2020; Son et al, 2019) . Pang and Ng (2016) examine emotive cue information-seeking and information-sharing behavior on Twitter over the lifecycle of a violent riot. Lai and Tang (2018) compare the foundation, processes, and effects of American, Chinese and Australian individuals' curation of information from social media and mobile devices in disaster management.",

However, the features of health crises differ from those of natural disasters, which will lead to different information behaviors. During the health crisis, a city must manage two tasks-dealing with the sudden large number of sick people and keeping city life as normal as possible for everyone else (WHO, 2009). Studies have not paid attention to how to maintain a normal life during a J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f health crisis, such as the lockdown situation. Furthermore, information behavior during natural disasters focuses more attention on information seeking and sharing to survive the disasters. In contrast, information behavior during lockdowns emphasizes adaption to maintain a normal life.",

However, extant studies on information behavior have concentrated on information seeking, but there is a dearth of information use studies (Spink & Cole, 2006) . By using information, individuals integrate newly acquired information into their existing knowledge bases. In our study, we learned that information resourcing activities do not guarantee that individuals will be good at using the information without needing to adapt. Residents affected by disasters resource, process, and incorporate disaster-relevant information effectively into their existing knowledge base (Yang and Hsieh, 2013) . To adapt, residents learn to use emerging online technologies and process an overwhelming amount of information before this information becomes useful (Spink & Cole, 2006) . The three orchestrating mechanisms played critical roles in information use during the lockdown. They served as a foundation for overcoming information flow impediments by providing essential information, reducing information overload, and facilitating people's mastery of information technology.",
