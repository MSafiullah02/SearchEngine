As such, it is useful to consider immunomodulation approaches to infectious diseases in the context of microbial pathogenesis. In contrast to microbe-centric views, in which microbial pathogenesis and virulence are considered to reflect singular microbial functions, the Damage-response framework provides a flexible construct that accounts for the contribution of the host, as well as the microbe, to these entities [2]. The Damage-response framework considers host damage to be the common denominator in microbial pathogenesis. Based on this tenet, host damage can be plotted against the host immune response as a U-shaped curve, whereby the maximal host damage resulting from a given host\u2013microbe interaction occurs both when the immune response is weak and when it is overly strong (Figure 1, Figure 2\n). The inherent flexibility afforded by this curve lies in its ability to account for the fact that certain microbes only cause disease in certain hosts, a phenomenon that cannot be explained by views of microbial pathogenesis that consider virulence to be a singular microbial trait [2].",

            "text": "A logical corollary of the Damage-response framework is that infectious diseases only occur in susceptible hosts. Host immune mechanisms protect against infectious diseases by preventing or reducing the damage that can result from host\u2013microbe interaction. The relationship between host immunity and microbial pathogenesis is clearly exemplified in immunocompromised hosts, by diseases that are caused by commensal microbes, such as Candida albicans and Staphylococcus epidermidis, and fungi, such as Cryptococcus neoformans and Pneumocystis jurevecci, and the success of immune reconstitution in preventing HIV-associated diseases caused by these microbes. The phenomenon of immune reconstitution disease that follows antiretroviral therapy with highly active anti-retroviral therapy, or HAART, in patients with AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome) illustrates how rebounding immunity can produce disease (discussed in [3]). Because the success of antimicrobial therapy is a function of its ability to ameliorate disease, and disease is a manifestation of host damage, the Damage-response framework provides a useful construct to consider approaches to treating infectious diseases that reduce host damage resulting from the host\u2013microbe interaction.",

            "text": "There are powerful historical precedents for the use of antibody-based therapies to treat infectious diseases (reviewed in [5]). The first era of antimicrobial therapy, early in the 20th century, was based on serum therapy with antibody preparations. Hence, the inaugural antimicrobial agents were immunomodulators [6]. First generation antibody reagents were abandoned because of their toxicity, which was a result of their impurity and derivation from non-human species, and the arrival of antimicrobial drugs that acted directly on the microbe. Nonetheless, there was evidence for synergism between antibiotics and serum therapies [7]. Serum therapy was validated in animal models before being administered to humans [7]; however, the mechanism by which it ameliorated infectious diseases or enhanced the efficacy of antimicrobial drugs was largely unknown. For most of the 20th century, the mechanisms of antibody action that were thought to influence antibody efficacy included their ability to neutralize, promote opsonization and phagocytosis or antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) and/or to activate complement [8]. However, a significantly more robust menu of potential mechanisms of antibody action, which includes direct antimicrobial action, immunomodulation and generation of oxidative species, has emerged over the past decade [8]. For example, the efficacy of a pneumococcal capsular polysaccharide-specific antibody was associated with modulation of the cellular response to pneumococcus in the lungs of mice with pulmonary infection [9\u2022]. This finding suggested that the well-documented ability of serum therapy to ameliorate fever and other clinical symptoms of pneumococcal pneumonia [10] could have reflected a downregulation of the host inflammatory response (or damage control). Perhaps the observation that pneumococcal pneumonia was only responsive to serum therapy with the homologous capsular polysaccharides-specific antiserum in the first three days of symptoms indicated that its capacity to mediate immunomodulation was limited to the early stages of disease. Antibodies to other microbes, including C. neoformans and Histoplasma capsulatum are able to modulate the cellular immune response to pulmonary infection (see [11\u2022]). Studies of antibody action have shown that the older dichotomous view that antibody immunity was only effective against extracellular pathogens, whereas cellular immunity was responsible for immunity against intracellular pathogens has been deconstructed by evidence that antibody reagents can be effective against classical intracellular pathogens, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, C. neoformans, H. capsulatum and scores of viruses [11\u2022].",

Licensed in 1998, Palivizumab is a neutralizing, humanized monoclonal antibody (mAb) to protein F on respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) that reduced hospitalization for RSV in premature and other high-risk infants when given as prophylaxis [12]. Because the antiviral activity of Palivizumab was associated with a reduction in inflammatory mediator release in a murine model of RSV [13\u2022], its mechanism of action probably involves immunomodulation. Despite ongoing controversies about the cost and target population of Palivizumab, its success in reducing the risk of RSV in high-risk infants promoted the development of second generation reagents and vaccine candidates [14].",

Patients who received Mycograb and amphotericin B showed a higher rate of complete overall response on day 10 of therapy, a significantly better mycological response and less Candida-attributable mortality than patients who received amphotericin B and a placebo. Mycograb was safe and well-tolerated; however, episodes of hypertension occurred more frequently in patients who received Mycograb than those who received a placebo. Mycograb is a recombinant antibody fragment lacking an Fc region, and is produced from a human anti-Hsp90 (heat-shock protein 90) cDNA library with an epitope that inhibits fungal Hsp90, NILKVIRKNIVKK [16]. The development of this antibody was driven by the observation that recovery from invasive candidiasis was associated with the appearance of antibodies to a 47 kDa determinant [17] that was found to be a fungal homolog of human Hsp90. Mycograb was tested in patients in comparison to standard therapy. As such, the question of whether or not its efficacy in vivo depends on synergy with antifungal drugs is unanswered. Nonetheless, the in vitro activity of Mycograb (with amphotericin B and other antifungal agents) against resistant Candida and other fungal species [18, 19] suggests it could hold promise as a broadly active antifungal agent.",

A human mAb to Bacillus anthracis toxin has recently successfully completed Phase I trials and stands as a potentially useful therapeutic in the event of an anthrax biological attack [23\u2022]. Several human mAbs to the SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) coronavirus have been developed that might be useful if the disease reappears [24\u2022]. Remarkably, these mAbs were developed to the point that clinical use was possible in less than five years. Human mAbs were highly effective against experimental shiga-toxin producing Escherichia coli in piglets [25]. Studies in experimental models have revealed that the efficacy of certain mAbs depends on intact cellular immunity (see [11\u2022, 26]). As such, the use of mAbs in immunocompromised patients could depend on whether its efficacy requires the immune function (a subset or element of) that is lacking in the relevant patient(s). mAbs have the advantage of homogeneity and high specific activity. Although there is concern that mAbs could have limited usefulness for microbes that demonstrate high antigenic variation and mutability, combinations of mAbs have shown promise in overcoming this limitation [27\u2022\u2022].",

The sIgs are the mainstay of managing exposures to viral agents in susceptible individuals who are not candidates for live vaccines, such as pregnant women and patients with impaired immunity [29]. A polyclonal preparation derived from individuals with high serum antibody titers to staphylococcal fibrinogen-binding proteins, serine aspartate dipeptide repeat G and clumping factor A is under clinical development [30\u2022]. An evaluation of this preparation in very low-weight infants revealed a trend toward fewer staphylococcal and candidal infections [31]. The ability of preformed antibodies to provide immediate defense against infectious diseases in susceptible individuals provides a potent justification for the use of antibodies, for example, in the setting of an act of bioterrorism or of epidemic diseases [32].",

Despite the logical basis for this concept, the potential antimicrobial power of these agents has been difficult to harness clinically. Currently, there are only a few examples of the use of adjunctive cytokines against infectious diseases. Notable exceptions are the use of recombinant \u03b1-interferons and nucleoside analogs for hepatitis B virus (HBV) and pegylated interferons and ribavirin for hepatitis C virus (HCV) [38].

There was a trend towards mycological response and clinical improvement among interferon recipients, with 26% showing improvement, compared to 8% of placebo-controlled subjects. Although this difference did not reach statistical significance, the trend towards a beneficial effect of adjunctive interferon is encouraging, calling for further, larger scale studies and studies to identify those patients in whom adjunctive immunotherapy could be beneficial. The rationale for interferon therapy for cryptococcosis has a strong basis in preclinical studies in mice [42] and a human study showing an association between cerebrospinal fluid levels of IFN\u2013\u03b3 and treatment in HIV-infected patients with cryptococcal meningitis [43\u2022]. In light of the established benefit of interferon therapy for the prevention of bacterial diseases in patients with chronic granulomatous disease [44], adjunctive interferon could hold promise as an adjunctive agent for HIV-associated cryptococcal meningitis. However, the absence of surrogate markers that can predict the patients who would benefit from interferon therapy underscores the potential pitfalls in study-design and patient selection for clinical trials. This is particularly problematic for cryptococcal meningitis, a disease that can occur in the case of weak or reconstituted immunity in patients with HIV infection [3]. The failure to demonstrate the effect of a pro-inflammatory immunomodulator could reflect the induction of an excessive inflammatory response that promotes disease. Figure 1 provides a schematic interpretation of the use of IFN\u2013\u03b3 therapy in the context of the Damage-response framework. Depending on the immunological status of the affected patient, adjunctive IFN\u2013\u03b3 therapy could be beneficial or detrimental.",

The rationale for the use of colony stimulating factors (CSFs), derived from granulocytes (G-CSF) or macrophages (GM-CSF), is in part based on their ability to alleviate neutropenia [45]. Data on the clinical use of adjunctive CSFs for fungal diseases is limited to small studies or case reports (see [45] for review). Nonetheless, administration of GM-CSF with antifungal agents in patients with invasive fungal infections was associated with decreased patient mortality or better response rates compared to a placebo [46] or antifungal therapy alone [47]. In view of the small number of affected patients and medical and ethical considerations in the design of randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled studies, it is possible that safe, well-tolerated candidate immunomodulators that are beneficial in preclinical studies will find their way into the antimicrobial armamentarium through compassionate use protocols and salvage therapy [48\u2022\u2022].",

However, a relatively underappreciated principle of microbial pathogenesis is that the damage resulting from host\u2013microbe interaction can be the result of an overly exuberant host response [2]. Hence, there is a rationale for use of therapeutic interventions that dampen or reduce, as well as those that enhance or augment, the inflammatory response. It has been proposed that the beneficial effect of IVIG against inflammatory diseases involves engagement of the inhibitory Fc receptor, which downregulates the inflammatory response [49]. Probiotics, which are live bacteria derived from the human gastrointestinal tract, have been used as therapy for inflammatory bowel diseases, including antibiotic-associated diarrhea [50]. Probiotics remain outside the established antimicrobial armamentarium and are fraught with the potential for harm in immunocompromised hosts [51]. Nonetheless, it is logical to postulate that replacement and/or enhanced activity of the human microbiota could be beneficial for treatment of infectious diseases that reflect a failure of mucosal surfaces or of the innate mechanisms they bolster to protect against microbe-mediated damage (see [1\u2022\u2022]).",

            "text": "Corticosteroids are important anti-inflammatory agents. Despite decades of controversy, corticosteroids have been validated as an important adjunct to antimicrobial therapy for bacterial meningitis [52\u2022], HIV-associated Pneumocystis pneumonia [53] and tuberculosis meningitis [54\u2022]. However, their mechanism of efficacy in these diseases might not be a direct anti-inflammatory effect [55]. Intriguingly, agents which have been proposed to have anti-inflammatory effects are macrolide antibiotics [56\u2022]. The ability of macrolides to suppress the release of inflammatory mediators from phagocytes in vitro has been recognized for some time, but the clinical relevance of this phenomenon remains uncertain. Nonetheless, it has been hypothesized that the benefit of low-dose macrolide therapy in chronic pulmonary diseases, could be as a result of macrolide-induced reductions in levels of inflammatory cytokines, neutrophil recruitment and biofilm formation, which have been observed in animal models and/or in vitro [57]. In contrast to macrolides, amphotericin B [58] and penicillin [59] induce the release of inflammatory mediators in vitro through Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2)-mediated stimulation. The inflammatory properties of these drugs raise the question of whether their immunomodulatory properties have an independent contribution to their therapeutic efficacy.",

In this patient, the administration of IFN\u2013\u03b3 is pro-inflammatory and the increased inflammatory response might facilitate control of the infection, thus reducing damage and symptoms of disease. By contrast, Patient 2 is an individual with cryptococcal disease following immune reconstitution with HAART.

By contrast, Patient 2 has an infectious disease that reflects the outcome of an overly exuberant immune response, such as mediastinal fibrosis from histoplasmosis or allergic aspergillosis. In this individual, an anti-inflammatory immunomodulator could dampen the host the inflammatory response, thus reducing damage and symptoms of disease. Notably, the immune response of this individual could have already resulted in microbial clearance.
