Capsaicin is a selective agonist of the transient receptor potential channel, vanilloid subfamily member 1 (TRPV1). After exposition to vanilloid solution, C. elegans wild type (N2) and mutants were placed on petri dishes divided in quadrants for heat stimulation. Thermal avoidance index was used to phenotype each tested C. elegans experimental groups. The data revealed for the first-time that capsaicin can impede nocifensive response of C. elegans to noxious heat (32\u00b0C -35\u00b0C) following a sustained exposition. The effect was reversed 6h post capsaicin exposition.",

Seven TRP subfamilies including TRPV analogs (e.g. OSM-9 and OCR-1-4) were identified and characterized. Furthermore, it has been established that C. elegans TRP channels are associated with behavioral and physiological processes, including sensory transduction of noxious heat [Glauser et al. 2011; Venkatachalam et al. 2014 ]. Many C. elegans TRP channels share similar activation and regulatory mechanisms with their mammal counterparts. Preliminary results suggest that the thermal avoidance response of C. elegans is increased by the application of the TRPV1 agonist capsaicin compatible with the characteristic pungent effect but did not appear to attenuate the perceived intensity of noxious heat under the experimental conditions used during these studies [Wittenburg and Baumeister, 1999; Tobin et al. 2002] .",

Detailed studies have shown that AFD neurons are the main thermosensors in C. elegans [Mori and Ohshima 1995 ; Koutarou et al., 2004] . Besides, FLP neurons located in the head and PHC neurons in the tail act as thermal nociceptive neurons and both express heat-and capsaicin-sensitive TRPV channels, OCR-2 and OSM-9 [Liu et al., 2012; Glauser et al., 2011] . The thermal avoidance assay we have performed is described in Figure 2 and was specifically used to assess if capsaicin can impede nocifensive response to noxious heat and we tested specific C. elegans mutants to identify capsaicin targets. The initial experiment involved an assessment of the mobility and bias of WT (N2) and mutants ocr-1, ocr-2, ocr-3, ocr-4 and osm-9 nematodes in absence or in presence of capsaicin.

Thus, we have exposed nematodes to capsaicin in solution and consequently had complete control of time and exposition levels.

Following capsaicin exposition, nematodes were thoroughly washed and transferred on NGM agar kept at 22\u02daC in an incubator for 6h (i.e. residual effect/latency test) and thermal avoidance response was retested.

            "text": "[6]-Gingerol, [6]-shogaol and curcumin are structural analogs of capsaicin, and molecular modeling studies indicate that the vanillyl moiety, as well as the long unsaturated acyl chain, have significant impacts on relative binding affinities with the TRPV1 receptor (Viswanadhan et al., 2007) . Thus, the chemical structure similarities of [6]-gingerol, [6]-shogaol and curcumin with capsaicin suggest that it could be a good ligand of the capsaicin-sensitive TRPV channels and produce anti-nociceptive effects in C. elegans. Olvanil is a potent agonist of the TRPV1 and it is 10-fold more potent agonist compared to capsaicin [Alsalem et al., 2016] . Olvanil is used as a positive control in our study. Capsazepine, a well-studied TRPV1 antagonist, attenuates nocifensive responses but its efficacy strongly varies depending on the experimental model used [Walpole et al., 1994; Salat and Filipek, 2015] . Thermal avoidance response of C. elegans was tested following a 1h exposition to [6]-gingerol, [6]-shogaol and curcumin as well as olvanil and the antagonist, capsazepine all at 50 \u00b5M. The initial experiment involved an assessment of the mobility and bias of WT (N2) nematodes in absence or in presence of [6]-gingerol, [6]-shogaol and curcumin as well as olvanil and the antagonist, capsazepine all at 50 \u00b5M without noxious heat stimulation. As shown in Figure 5A , nematodes were not preferably selecting any quadrant and were uniformly distributed after 30 minutes following the initial placement at the center of the marked petri dish for all tested group. Thus, we performed the thermal avoidance test since these molecules had no impact on normal nematode behavior. The data shown in Figure 5B , revealed that all capsaicin analogues (p < 0.0001) and capsazepine (p < 0.0001) hinder nocifensive response of C. elegans to noxious heat. The anti-nociceptive effects observed following a 1h exposition at 50 \u00b5M is comparable to capsaicin. Anti-nociceptive effects or analgesia was observed in animal models of pain or in human for all these capsaicin analogues [Jones et al., 2011; Groninger and Randall, 2012; Tamburini et al., 2018] .",

Additionally, we have identified the capsaicin target, OCR-2. Further experiments also undoubtedly revealled anti-nociceptive effect for capsaicin analogues, including ginger (Zingiber officinale) and turmeric (Curcuma longa) secondary metabolites. The usage of capsaicin as a clinically viable drug is limited by its unpleasant side effects, such as burning sensation, gastric irritation and stomach cramps. The rapid growing technological advancements allows the identification and isolation of molecules from specific herbal products. Using mass spectrometry, we can specifically identify and isolate secondary metabolites containing the vanillyl group, the capsaicin pharmacophore. C. elegans offer an opportunity for screening of large vanilloid libraries for anti-nociceptive activity to isolate rapidly effective constituents. Figures   Figure 1 .

For head avoidance assay, plates were divided into quadrants two test (A and D) and two controls (B and C). Sodium azide was added to all four quadrants to paralyze nematodes. C.elegans were added at the center of the plate (n=50 to 250) and after 30 minutes, animals were counted on each quadrant. Only animals outside the inner circle were scored. The calculation of thermal avoidance index was performed as described. Figure 3 . Comparison of the mobility and bias for WT (N2) and mutants ocr-1, ocr-2, ocr-3, ocr-4 and osm-9 nematodes in plates divided into quadrants conserved at constant temperature (22\u02daC) and no stimulus was applied (negative control). No quadrant selection bias was observed for all C. elegans genotype tested in absence or presence of capsaicin at 50 \u00b5M. Figure 4 . Assessment of the pharmacological effect of capsaicin on thermal avoidance in C. elegans. A) Capsaicin (Cap) dose-response assessment. Nematodes were exposed to capsaicin for 60 min prior behavior experimentations. The observed capsaicin effect is dose-dependent and noticeably impedes thermal avoidance in C. elegans. **** p < 0.0001, ** p < 0.01 (ANOVA -Dunnett's Multiple Comparison). B) Capsaicin (Cap) timedependent response evaluation. Nematodes were exposed to 50 \u00b5M of capsaicin in solution for various time periods prior behavior experimentations. The decrease thermal avoidance was plateaued following a 60 min exposition. **** p < 0.0001 (ANOVA -Dunnett's Multiple Comparison). C) Identification of TRPV orthologs responsible for capsaicininduced anti-nociceptive effect.

Assessment of the anti-nociceptive and desensitizing effects of vanilloid analogues of capsaicin. All tested analogues (50 \u00b5M) and capsaicin (50 \u00b5M) produced significant anti-nociceptive and desensitizing effects in C. elegans. Moreover, capsazepine (50 \u00b5M), a known antagonist of the TRPV1, hampered the heat avoidance behavior in C. elegans. ",
