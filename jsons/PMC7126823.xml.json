As the sole hospital to accept SARS cases in Vietnam after the middle of May 2003, BMH played a very important role. Besides, it appears that the technical guidance given under the project made a great contribution as the basis of the successful SARS control. Dispatch of the Japan Disaster Relief Team also helped to implement effective infection control and respiratory management.",

Furthermore, detailed status of nosocomial infection and causative agents should be strictly monitored, and antibiotics must be correctly used [16], [17]. At BMH, the monitoring of nosocomial infection rate is used as one of the indices to determine the quality of medical care. For this purpose, results of the fact-finding study as described in the present article are used as an effective basic data.",
