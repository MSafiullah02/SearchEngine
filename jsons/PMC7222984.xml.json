We scrutinize minutiae with the goal of keeping those teetering on the edge, alive. The long-term implications of the patient\u2019s brain injury are often left for whispered conversations or private contemplation, when we question whether our patient will ever be the person he once was. During family meetings, we describe in broad strokes the natural history of the patient\u2019s disease and potential outcomes. Often these conversations end with a discussion about goals of care (GoC) and questions posed to families\u2014\u201cIf your loved one was able to make decisions; how would he want us to move forward? What amount of disability would be acceptable to her? In light of this, often uncertain, prognosis and potential for recovery, would they choose a medically-aggressive restorative path or ask to focus solely on comfort?\u201d",

As intensivists, we may place our patients within the literature to give the dire prediction of a modified Rankin score of 5, but we rarely see how patients and families experience such an outcome after they leave the intensive care unit (ICU). Acknowledging the complexity of the actual versus predicted psychosocial impact of neurologic disability on patients\u2019 and caregivers\u2019 QoL is paramount to guiding families to make the most informed decisions for their loved one\u2019s care. Recovery clinics for ICU survivors have consistently demonstrated benefits in these realms for both patients and ICU teams [1].",

Outside hospital imaging revealed an aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage with blood casted in the right lateral, 3rd, and 4th ventricles. On arrival to our unit, he was comatose with unequal pupils and decerebrate posturing. An extraventricular drain was emergently placed, and he was taken to the interventional radiology (IR) suite for coiling of his anterior communicating artery aneurysm. Already, his angiogram demonstrated severe bilateral anterior cerebral artery vasospasm. Over the next 2 weeks, he required high-dose vasopressors and frequent trips to the IR suite for management of severe vasospasm. He developed a host of complications including stress cardiomyopathy, hypoxic respiratory failure, paralytic ileus, recurrent refractory fevers, and healthcare-associated infections. Prior to requiring paralytics for ventilator synchrony, at best, he could intermittently open his eyes to noxious stimuli and inconsistently attend briefly to voice.",

His girlfriend recounted previous conversations indicating that he would consider virtually any physical or mental disability to be worse than death, and his mother agreed that he had a high bar set for what might be considered an acceptable QoL. They agreed that he was strong-willed and independent and never would have wanted this kind of ICU care.

He responded, \u201cNo,\u201d blankly, and she explained that he spends the vast majority of his waking life tuning out, not interacting with the outside world. Bedside testing revealed a Montreal Cognitive Assessment score of 13/30 and significant lack of insight. He knew that he was not quite himself, but the details were minced.

The visit also provides an opportunity to make certain that medications are appropriate for the patient\u2019s stage of recovery, to engage rehabilitation services, and to provide support and resources for caregivers in their new roles. Meanwhile, through these follow-up visits, we can begin to develop a true understanding of what recovery from neurologic critical illness really means; we see first-hand the challenges patients and families face while adjusting to new lives they never expected; we listen to caregivers maintain positivity and gratitude until their voices crack under the weight of their burdens. We grapple alongside them, bearing the consequences of our joint decisions. In the end, this intimate portrait of coping and recovery has the potential to shape our views and color our conversations for future patients [2]. While these clinics for now are uncommon, creating this opportunity for engagement can be simply attained by co-managing selected patients in resident clinics following their stay, inviting survivors and families back to the ICU to speak about their experiences or working to develop a clinic of your own [7, 8].",
