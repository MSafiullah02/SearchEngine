            "text": "Clinical maternal viral infection is not uncommon in pregnancy and when it occurs, either as a primary or reactivational infection with viraemia, the fetus is placed at risk of infection through transplacental transmission. 1 Subclinical maternal viral infection must be common as there is nucleic acid evidence of viral exposure in 40-44% of healthy newborns. 2, 3 It has been postulated that fetal viral infection in utero may increase the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes (APOs), such as pregnancy-induced hypertensive disorders (PIHD), birthweight <10th percentile (small for gestational age, SGA) and preterm birth (PTB). [4] [5] [6] The placenta acts as a potential barrier to the transfer of viruses from mother to fetus during the viraemic phase of maternal infection. 7 The placental barrier may be less effective in early pregnancy and when the placenta is damaged, for example by infarction caused by vascular disease. Placental dysfunction has also been associated with acquired and genetic thrombophilia, systemic lupus erythematosus and pre-existing diabetes. Clinical syndromes associated with placental insufficiency and/or placental vasculopathy include pre-eclampsia, SGA, PTB and fetal demise. Very little is known about the passage of viruses across the placenta or the role of placental viral infection in adverse pregnancy and fetal outcomes. However, it is postulated that viral infection of extravillous trophoblast cells may alter the process of placental invasion and predispose the mother and fetus to adverse reproductive outcomes that result from placental dysfunction. 8 Herpesviruses (including cytomegalovirus (CMV), herpes simplex viruses (HSV) 1 and 2, varicella-zoster virus (VZV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and human herpesviruses (HHV) 6, 7 and 8) and enteroviruses are capable of crossing the placenta and causing in utero infection [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] and could potentially contribute directly or indirectly to APOs. It has been shown that CMV infection impairs critical aspects of cytotrophoblast function, which may explain some of the deleterious effects of this virus on pregnancy outcome. 17 The likelihood of maternal infection resulting in fetal infection varies according to the specific virus, whether the infection is primary or recurrent, and the gestational age of the fetus at the time of infection. Once the infection has crossed the placenta into the fetal circulation, there is the potential for adverse fetal outcomes. These can be caused by the infectious agent directly or indirectly through the fetal and/or placental inflammatory response to infection, where proinflammatory cytokines may adversely affect the developing brain and perhaps also placental function.",

Such multiple analyses increase the likelihood of identifying chance statistical associations (type 1 error) and because of small numbers in some of the subanalyses, associations cannot be confidently excluded (type 2 error). Limitations imposed by our ethics committee meant that we were unable to access case notes or other relevant clinical information about our cases and controls. Information such as Doppler studies on umbilical and uterine arteries, if available, would have enhanced this study. Our chosen outcomes may causally interact to result in an APO, and there are inherent difficulties in determining the roles played by the individual outcomes.

            "text": "Despite these caveats, this study has demonstrated that the presence of viral nucleic acids, in particular Herpes PCR group B and CMV, in newborn screening blood samples may be associated with PIHD over a wide range of gestational ages. One mechanism by which such associations could be explained is the inflammatory response caused by these viruses. Vessel inflammation and artery wall thickening, as a result of viral infection, can contribute to the increased Our results demonstrated associations between CMV exposure and PIHD in all infants and term-born infants born to mothers who had PIHD. A marginally significant trend was observed (P = 0.05) between CMV exposure and PIHD in preterm infants born to mothers who had PIHD. We did not observe significant findings for the small subgroup PIHD with SGA. This may be because of the very small numbers in this subgroup, and large prospective studies would be needed to rule out such associations. von Dadelszen et al. 33 showed that women with early-onset pre-eclampsia had higher levels of anti-CMV antibodies than those with late-onset preeclampsia, those with normotensive intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) and those with normal pregnancies. Exposure to CMV and subsequent production of anti-CMV antibodies may generate pathogenic antiphospholipid antibodies, which are capable of binding and activating endothelial cells. 34 This in turn may enhance thrombus formation and increase inflammation, resulting in hypertension. A similar connection has been identified for enteroviral infection and atherosclerosis, 35 suggesting that several viral infections are capable of increasing blood pressure and causing hypertension. A study reported by Belfort et al. 36 demonstrated a significant association between evidence of CMV infection and pre-eclampsia (P < 0.01), thus supporting an association between pre-eclampsia and viral infection during pregnancy. An alternative hypothesis to explain the link between CMV and APOs is that CMV may affect the biology of cytotrophoblasts and thus critical cytotrophoblast function. 17 Our study demonstrated associations between PTB and exposure to viral infection, particularly CMV. This provides further evidence that the presence of infectious agents in utero is associated with subsequent PTB. 25, [37] [38] [39] Our study did not show any associations between exposure to viral nucleic acids and SGA, despite other research suggesting possible links. 5, 6 Fetal viral infection, in particular CMV, can cause SGA, however, no association was found in the present study. The results do, however, agree with van Dongen et al., 40 who found no associations between IUGR and adenoviruses or enteroviruses. Discrepancies may be explained by study design differences. Our study used nonquantitative PCR methodology on archived newborn screening cards, and there remains the possibility of the results reflecting differing viral loads. Low viral loads may not invoke significant inflammatory/cytokine responses and therefore may not create susceptibility to APOs, such as PTB or SGA; alternatively, high viral loads, possibly associated with major inflammation and/or damaging cytokine production, could be necessary before such adverse outcomes are observed. Furthermore, these results may reflect different gestational ages at which exposure to the virus first occurred. Infections that occur earlier in intrauterine life tend to be associated with more severe clinical sequelae compared with those occurring later. 41 Positive amniotic fluid viral DNA PCR results have been associated with an increased rate of fetal structural malformations, IUGR, hydrops and other fetal abnormalities. 6 These tests were performed between 19-20 weeks of gestation compared with 3-5 days after birth in the current study, which may explain the differing results. Prospective studies designed to quantify viral loads at various gestational ages are planned to investigate this hypothesis further. Such prospective studies will also determine whether these infections are primary infections or reactivation of latent viral infection. This study was unable to test every potential virus worthy of investigation (e.g. adenoviruses, rotaviruses, human coronaviruses, parvovirus, paramyxoviruses and lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus), and these should be investigated in future studies.",

A similar control group prevalence of 44% was reported in 2005 by other authors, 42 suggesting that antenatal viral exposure is common but not clinically relevant unless other factors are present to initiate infection and/or an inflammatory response. It is important to recognise that the presence of viral DNA does not necessarily indicate active congenital or neonatal infection. Newborn screening cards were tested for the presence of viral DNA and RNA. While detection of viral nucleic acids in the blood of neonates indicates exposure to and replication of the respective virus or viruses, this study was not designed to detect evidence of an accompanying inflammatory response. Given the small sample volume (1.2 mm diameter) of dried blood and the limit of detection of 1-10 viral nucleic acid copies, it could not be confirmed that true viraemic infection was occurring. It would seem unlikely that the detection of viral nucleic acid in such small samples merely reflected maternal and fetal cell trafficking or maternal blood contamination. The possibility of nosocomial infection needs to be considered, although it is thought exceedingly unlikely that this infection would have had time to incubate Viruses and adverse pregnancy outcomes \u00aa 2008 The Authors Journal compilation \u00aa RCOG 2008 BJOG An International Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology and cause infection in the newborn infant within the first days of life without clinical symptoms. Clinically, a nosocomial infection rate of 40% in our control population would have been identified as a major epidemic, which was not evident. Prospective investigations are required to follow women through pregnancy, quantitatively testing antenatal blood samples for viral nucleic acids and determining if there is active infection in the fetus/neonate by examining leukocytes and sera for the presence of viral antigens associated with active viral replication. PCR contamination was excluded by working in two designated separate laboratories for preparation of PCR samples (to eliminate the possibility of PCR product contamination) and by using appropriate controls in all assays. Furthermore, no other viral PCR work was being conducted by other users of the PCR laboratories.",

These exploratory findings require confirmation in other studies. These findings support the previously published indirect findings (such as antibody responses) of others that pointed to a relationship between CMV and hypertension of pregnancy. Our findings suggest that some APOs could potentially be prevented by immunisation or passive immunity through virus-specific immunoglobulin. It is likely that APOs are multifactorial and that other factors, such as genetic susceptibility to infection, genetically regulated proinflammatory cytokine responses and inherited thrombophilia 19 are needed for the adverse phenotypes to be expressed.",
