Fortunately, public health measures, including isolation and quarantine, finally put an end to the SARS pandemic in summer 2003. In 2009, the influenza A/H1N1 swept over 200 countries and regions, leaving with more than 18 449 deaths [5] . Subsequently, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), another coronavirus, has posed a continuous threat to global health since 2012. Considered as a zoonotic virus, MERS-CoV infection is reported occasionally and sometimes in cluster, such as the outbreak in South Korea where one infected traveler back from the Middle East led to 186 infections and 36 deaths in 2015 [6] . By November 2019, MERS-CoV has infected 2494 individuals and caused 858 deaths [7] . In addition, Ebola virus outbreak in 2014 and Zika virus outbreak in 2015 both contributed dramatic damage to the affected countries.",

As a result, relatively quick response and actions were made during the MERS outbreak in South Korea in 2015, avoiding further spread in China. Realizing the severity of SARS-CoV as a respiratory virus, the detection of pneumonia of unknown origin in 2019-nCoV outbreak enabled relatively early alarm from health authorities and raised awareness for medical staff to equip personal protection methods when dealing with suspected cases.

On January 23, Wuhan City, the initial epidemic focus, suspended all public transport to prevent further transmission during the Spring Festival holiday (starting from January 25), which was then simulated by several other neighboring cities. At the same time, Chinese community-based governments also adapt receptive measures to propagate the threat brought by 2019-nCoV and recommend personal hygiene in the communities.

Several groups have independently isolated a novel pathogen from the lower respiratory tract of the patients in early January 2020. Zhu et al. identified the pathogen as a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) by unbiased sequencing and obtained the transmission electron microscopy image [12] . This finding was supported by data from other groups and genomic studies showed that 2019-nCoV was closest to a SARS-like coronavirus in bats, and that the receptorbinding domain (RBD) was close to that of SARS-CoV, suggesting ACE2 as the possible receptor [13] [14] [15] [16] .
