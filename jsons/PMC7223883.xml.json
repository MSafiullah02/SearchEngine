In high-income countries, PICU being attended by a pediatric intensivist is not a matter of debate. In those countries, favorable impact of 24 h in-hospital presence of a PICU attending physician had been demonstrated [3, 4]. In Turkey, before the graduation of pioneer PICU fellows, only 30% of the PICUs were attended by pediatric intensivists [5]. In high-income countries, organization of PICUs were completed 30 y ago and many studies about the quality of care were conducted since then. In Turkey, PICU fellowship program was initiated at 2011. First fellows graduated at the end of 2014. In Turkey, doctors in every specialty are obliged to serve in state hospitals for a predefined time period. For this reason the first graduate of the PICU fellowship program was appointed to a hospital of Ministry of Health. There had been no PICU specialists in that hospital previously and this situation allowed authors to measure how the presence of an intensivist affected the quality of care in a PICU.",

Duration of mechanical ventilation shortened from 23.8 d to 7 d with the arrival of the intensivist. Presence of the intensivist reduced the mechanical ventilation duration by 59% (Table 2). Reduction of the mechanical ventilation duration is important as it is associated with complications such as ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP), subglottic stenosis and tolerance to sedative agents [4, 8\u201310]. Patients could be extubated more quickly as a result of more efficient use of mechanical ventilator by the pediatric intensivist. This situation resulted in a decrease in the number and rate of VAP in the PICU (5.1 vs. 2.4).",

Presence of intensivist reduced the length of stay in the PICU by 41.2% (Table 2). Before the pediatric intensivist, indication of PICU admission was not clear and patients with terminal diseases were admitted to the PICU. This was the main underlying reason for the prolonged PICU stay and higher rate of nosocomial infections and misusage of the valuable PICU beds. Prolonged mechanical ventilator duration, higher percentage of extubation failure, prolonged mechanical ventilator duration prior to tracheotomy are also consistent with all factors mentioned above.",

All the patients who were not at terminal stage and have deteriorated in other departments were transferred to PICU and treated at PICU under the responsibility of the pediatric intensivist. This situation increased the motivation of other departments to work with PICU. Administrative officials were convinced by informing them regularly about the changes in the system and updating them about the prognosis of patients in the PICU.",

It is not possible to provide 100% coverage of PICU beds by intensivists in our country today due to the lack of educated pediatric intensivists. It has been previously reported that the ratio of the number of pediatric intensivists to PICU beds is 1:31.7 in Turkey [5] while this ratio is 1:2\u20131:4.5 in United States, 1:3\u20131:5 in Australia, and 1:1.2\u20131:1.6 in Europe [17]. This study evidently showed that the management of PICU beds by an intensivist constitutes a remarkable positive effect on PICU outcomes in many aspects. Although it is not one of the targets of this study, it is obvious that all these mentioned aspects above also influence the high costs of the intensive care.",
