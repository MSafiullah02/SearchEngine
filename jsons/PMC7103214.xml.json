Bats are divided into two orders, Megachiroptera and Microchiroptera, and bats, especially fruit bats of Megachiroptera, are currently being focused on as a source of emerging infections such as rabies virus (RV), Nipah virus, Hendra virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus, and Ebola virus [1], [2], [3], [4], [5]. Of these viruses, RV, which belongs to the Rhabdoviridae family, genus Lyssavirus, is spreading the most worldwide and has a wide host range [6]. In mammals, RV infection causes 100% mortality, but some bats have shown no clinical signs with detectable antibody titers and were able to resist infection and become a carrier when infected with RV [7], [8], [9], [10]. Although immunological studies of bats may provide important clues to help clarify the relationships between host immune factors and viruses, few studies have been performed on the immune system of bats [6], [11], [12], [13].",

            "text": "Type I IFN, one of the most important antiviral immune factors, is associated with the ability to reduce virus replication by inducing cellular gene expression of numerous antiviral factors, termed interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) [14], [15], [16], [17]. Following virus infection in vivo, the IFN response is critical in restricting virus spread before the onset of adaptive immune system responses to control the infection [14], [15], [16], [17]. Newly synthesized IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 is secreted and binds to the type-I IFN receptors on the surface of infected and neighboring cells, inducing the Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of a transcription (Jak/STAT) signaling cascade [15], [18], [19]. STAT1 and STAT2 are activated by phosphorylation and form heterodimers that associate with a third factor, IFN regulatory factor-9 (IRF-9) [15], [18], [19]. The resulting complex, IFN-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3), translocates to the nucleus and induces the transcription of ISGs through a promoter element IFN-stimulated response element (ISRE). In contrast, only natural killer (NK) cells and T cells secrete type-II IFN, IFN-\u03b3, in response to virus infections [15]. IFN-\u03b3 signaling also involves a Jak/STAT signaling cascade. When activated by phosphorylation, STAT1 forms a homodimeric complex, \u03b3-activated factor (GAF), which binds to promoters containing a \u03b3-activated sequence (GAS) element after translocation to the nucleus, inducing the transcription of various genes involved in the regulation of innate and adaptive immune responses [14], [15], [20].",

Many viruses are known to target STAT1, thereby inhibiting the expression of ISGs, to invade host cells. For example, Henipavirus V protein has been demonstrated to subvert IFN responses by sequestering STAT1 in high-molecular-mass cytoplasmic complexes by binding to STAT1 [19], [21], [22], [23], while Rhabdovirus P protein binds to STAT1 and retains it in the cytoplasm [24], [25]. Furthermore, Respirovirus C protein inhibits both STAT1 and STAT2 tyrosine phosphorylation [21], [26], [27]. As STAT1 performs pivotal roles in IFN signaling and is commonly targeted by various viruses, including viruses found in bats, we studied the function of STAT1 in bats, which are now considered to be a major source of emerging infections. In this study, we used Rousettus aegyptiacus, a kind of fruit bat, and examined its ability to phosphorylate and localize STAT1 in normal situations and in RV infection, then measured the expression profile of its mRNA in tissues.",

The level of STAT1 phosphorylation was highest in RV-infected cells stimulated with IFN-\u03b1 (Fig. 1A, lane 4; Fig. 1B, lane 4). Additionally, in the only RV-treated cells, STAT1 localized in the cytoplasm in both infected and uninfected cells as it would normally (Fig. 2g\u2013i). On the other hand, although STAT1 localized in the nucleus in uninfected cells (Fig. 2j\u2013l, arrowheads), STAT1 remained in the cytoplasm in RV-infected cells even after IFN treatment in the RV-treated cells (Fig. 2j\u2013l, arrows).

In humans, NK cells, which produce IFN-\u03b3, are known to be more abundant in liver, and the liver has plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), a major source of IFN-\u03b1 [33]. The fact that the basal expression level of bat STAT1 in liver is extremely high suggests the liver of bats consists of immune-related cells or includes other immune-related factors at a high rate, and play an important role in antiviral responses in bats.
