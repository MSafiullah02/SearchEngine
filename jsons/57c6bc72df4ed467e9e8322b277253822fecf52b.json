Estimates of the environmental contribution to disease have ranged from as low as 13% [1] to as high as 90% [2] . These differences arise in part due to varying definitions of \"environment.\" For example, a recent World Health Organization (WHO) assessment of the environmental contribution to preventable disease defined the environment as including \"exposure to pollution and chemicals (e.g., air, water, soil, products), physical exposures (e.g., noise, radiation), the built environment, other anthropogenic changes (e.g., climate change, vector breeding places), related behaviors and the work environment\" [1] . The WHO estimates that 13-32% of the global disease burden is attributable to these environmental determinants. In contrast, thought leaders have suggested that in the extreme, all diseases are environmental because \"genetic factors are actually also environmental, but merely on a different time scale\" [3] . An intermediate viewpoint defines the environment as all factors external to the genome. However, based in part on prior studies of twins that computed the fraction of diseases attributable to genetic versus nongenetic factors, somewhere between 70% and 90% of disease risks may be attributable to differences in environments [2] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 249, "end": 252, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 271, "end": 274, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 774, "end": 777, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 1084, "end": 1087, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1416, "end": 1419, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "This chapter adopts a perspective of environmental determinants of health consistent with that of the WHO and focuses on chronic diseases related to pollutants in outdoor air, household indoor air, workplaces, and drinking water.

Furthermore, waterborne contaminants associated with selflimiting AGI in healthy populations may lead to severe complications and mortality among sensitive populations, such as the elderly, immunocompromised, pregnant women, and young children. For example, the largest US waterborne disease outbreak in recent history occurred due to contamination of the Milwaukee, Wisconsin, water supply with Cryptosporidium for 2 weeks in 1993 [59, 60] . This outbreak sickened more than 400,000 people and caused 50 premature deaths, 85% of them among AIDS patients. Recent evidence suggests that repeated infections with Cryptosporidium among infants aged 0-2 can lead to malnutrition, impaired growth, and decreased educational performance during later childhood [61] . While waterborne disease outbreaks are generally rare in large municipal water systems, breakdowns in these systems occur. In addition to the Milwaukee example, one recent highly publicized example of the failure of a municipal system was the case in Flint, Michigan, where city residents were exposed to elevated levels of lead in their drinking water. The increase in lead exposure was caused by a switch in the city's water supply, from Lake Huron water treated by the City of Detroit to the corrosive water of the Flint River, as part of an effort to save money for the bankrupt city.

In some cases, such as for chronic beryllium disease, a change of jobs may be essential. Medical treatment (e.g., chelation therapy for lead exposure) is available for some environmental exposures. In other cases, a physician can refer patients to specialists in occupational medicine or other related fields. Physicians can also report suspected environmental and occupational illnesses to public health officials, trade union health specialists, and workplace managers, thus potentially leading to protections for others. In the case of exposures in the workplace, physicians can help patients to apply for workers' compensation to help cover their medical expenses.
