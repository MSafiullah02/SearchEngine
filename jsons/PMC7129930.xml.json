After the protein-bound column was pre-cleared with low concentration imidazole (Fig. 3), a linear gradient of urea in refolding buffer containing glycerol, reduced glutathione (GSH), and oxidized glutathione (GSSG) (Table 1) was applied, with flow rate held at 1 ml/min. The column was then washed with buffer E containing imidazole at 100 mM, eluting contaminant bacterial proteins but not the target protein (Fig. 3). Finally, the S450-650 protein was eluted using 800 mM imidazole containing glycerol and glucose (Table 1). The purity of the recombinant S450-650 protein thus obtained was approximately 95% as judged by SDS\u2013PAGE analysis (Fig. 3). Inclusion of glycerol and glucose in the refolding buffer and elute buffers appeared to be crucial, as the yield and the concentration of S450-650 significantly decreased when buffers without glycerol and glucose were used (Fig. 3, Table 2\n). The purification and yield of S450-650 from E. coli are summarized in Table 2. The eluted protein was dialyzed in PBS (pH 7.2) containing glycerol (20%) and glucose (5%), and stored at 300 \u03bcg\u2013500 \u03bcg/ml at \u221280 \u00b0C.",

However, it appears to be 31 kDa in SDS\u2013PAGE gels (Fig. 2, Fig. 3). We reckon this is because so the S450-650 protein contains 20 acidic residues (D, E) with a predicted iso-electric point of 4.3. It has been demonstrated that strongly acidic proteins behave abnormally in SDS-gels since the acidic amino acids do not bind SDS [24].",

This is probably due to the fact that S450-650 contains 64 hydrophobic amino acid residues (31.8% of the sequence). To obtain, reasonably high concentration S450-650 in soluble form, we adopted an on-column refolding and purification procedure. \u03b2-Mercaptoethanol and Triton X-100 were included in the inclusion body wash buffer and lysis buffer (Table 1), which help to solubilize hydrophobic proteins, reduce inter-chain disulfide bonds, and minimize non-specific binding of proteins to Ni column [16]. Glycerol and glucose were included in the refolding and elution buffers (Table 1). As powerful cosolvents, they are able to enhance native protein stability [25], [26], [27], [28], [29], [30], [31]. GSH/GSSG (1 mM GSH, 0.1 mM GSSG) were also helpful additives, because of the fact that the oxidizing conditions maintained by GSH/GSSG promote correct formation of disulfide bonds and dramatically increase the recombinant protein yield [20]. Yin et al. [16] showed that flow rate of the refolding buffer is a factor affecting protein refolding, whick was maintained at 1 ml/min in our experiments.",

When BALB/c mice were immunized with S450-650, a very strong IgG response was observed (Fig. 6\n). In ELISAs and Western blot assays, the S450-650 recombinant protein was recognized by serum Abs from convalescent SARS patients (Fig. 4, Fig. 5). It is of interest to note that sera from patient PT32 recognized the S450-650 polypeptide in ELISAs but not Western blot assays (Fig. 4, Fig. 5A). It is highly likely that Abs in PT32 serum were specific mainly for conformational rather than linear epitope(s) in the S450-650 fragment. In ELISAs, Abs can recognize native (undenatured and non-reduced) Ags, whilst in Western blot assays they can only react with Ags in denatured and reduced form. It can therefore be concluded that a certain proportion of the molecules of our recombinant S450-650 polypeptide refolded correctly following our on-column refolding procedure.",
