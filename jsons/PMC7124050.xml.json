Transplant candidates are routinely screened for serologic evidence of latent infections that may reactivate (HSV, VZV, CMV, EBV, hepatitis B and C, toxoplasmosis); some of these will be discussed later in this chapter. Some transplant centers will perform screening for tuberculosis with tuberculin skin test (TST) or interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA), at least for patients who are considered at significant risk for the disease. Prior invasive fungal infections may reactivate following transplant, and secondary prophylaxis is required [13\u201315]. Even active fungal infection has been reported to be controllable. There are, however, cases of progression of prior aspergillosis after transplant; myeloablative conditioning, prolonged neutropenia, cytomegalovirus (CMV) disease, and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) are risk factors [15, 16].",

There is evidence that some donor haplotypes of TLR4, the gene that encodes the toll-like receptor protein 4 (TLR4) are associated with increased risk of invasive aspergillosis after HCT [17]. Recipient\u2019s mutations in MBL2, the gene that encodes mannose-binding lectin (MBL), have been associated with increased risk of infection after neutrophil recovery following myeloablative transplant [18]. Other polymorphisms of MBL2 may be important for infection through a direct influence on the risk of developing GVHD [19, 20]. Different genotypes of activated killer immunoglobulin-like receptors (aKIR) in the donor have been found to protect from CMV reactivation [21]. Many of these associations are preliminary and require more data to be confirmed, but they hold the promise of a more individualized approach to infectious prophylaxis.",

This framework originated with myeloablative transplants, and is eminently pragmatic. The pre-engraftment phase may be accompanied by profound neutropenia and significant mucositis, which results in increased risk of bacterial infections from the resident gastrointestinal flora, candidiasis, aspergillosis (in cases of prolonged neutropenia) and herpes simplex virus reactivation. After engraftment, with neutropenia no longer being a factor, many infections are related to the profound defect in cellular immunity caused by the conditioning regimen and the immunosuppression administered to prevent GVHD. CMV reactivation and the development of acute GVHD and its treatment play a central role during this time. The day 100 landmark derives from the standard time at which immunosuppression (e.g., cyclosporine A or tacrolimus) is frequently tapered. Infections after this point would be primarily related to lack of immune reconstitution and, in the absence of GVHD, become progressively less common.",

The conditioning regimen has several goals: reduction of the malignancy (when there is one), creation of space in the bone marrow to provide a selective advantage to the infused stem cells, and elimination of the recipient\u2019s immune system to minimize the risk of rejection. Different conditioning regimens may be more appropriate depending on the disease and the general status of the recipient [22]. Myeloablative, reduced intensity, and nonmyeloablative are the general categories, but within each one there are substantial differences that may be relevant. In general, fully myeloablative regimens result in more prolonged neutropenia and more severe mucosal barrier damage, which may impact the infectious risk during the pre-engraftment period [23].",

T cell depletion may minimize or altogether prevent GVHD but may result in prolonged immunodeficiency, depending on the degree of depletion. If an unmanipulated product is used, T cell depletion may be attained in vivo by using alemtuzumab or ATG. These agents produce a profound depletion of T cells in vivo, and their long half-life makes them still be present and active in the recipient when the stem cell product is administered.",

A randomized controlled trial documented more infections in patients randomized to (moderate) T cell depletion than in the group who received pharmacologic immunosuppression [32]. T cell depletion in vivo with alemtuzumab has been associated with increased risk of infection [33]. It is possible that different pharmacological regimens may result in different infectious risks, but this has not been adequately studied.

The clinical syndrome of typical chronic GVHD is quite distinct from the acute form, and a new classification focusing on the clinical characteristics of the disease as well as on the timing is being increasingly used [39]. From the standpoint of infectious diseases, the important consideration is that the presence of chronic GVHD is associated with high risk of infection [40, 41]. Multiple immune defects have been described during chronic GVHD, involving humoral and cellular immunity [42, 43] as well as functional hyposplenism [44, 45]. Besides these abnormalities, that result in delayed immune reconstitution and poor response to immunizations, the risk is of infection is increased by the treatment of extensive cGVHD [41], which typically includes systemic corticosteroids and a variety of steroid-sparing agents. Notably, cGVHD is a well-documented risk for pneumococcal infections [45, 46], fungal infections, and late CMV disease. However, all types of infections are more common during cGVHD, particularly during the first few months [47].",

In some centers, the most frequent Gram-positive isolates are viridans group Streptococcus [55]; this may be a function of the conditioning regimen or the patient population. Enterococcus faecium, frequently VRE, is another Gram-positive organism that tends to cause bloodstream infection relatively early, although this seems to be rather institution dependent [57]. The Gram-negative bacteria are commonly Enterobacteriaceae. These infections are generally related to the disruption of the GI mucosa due to the preparative regimen. The role of reduced diversity of the microbiota with subsequent bacterial domination and ultimately bacteremia is an area of intense study [58]. The risk of bacteremia during neutropenia may be decreased by the use of prophylactic antibiotics [59, 60]. This had been shown in multiple studies over the years, but the recommendation of using antibiotics did not become part of practice guidelines until recently. It is not clear whether this recommendation will continue amidst the increasing concern over the role of antibiotic-induced decreased microbiome diversity on the outcome of HCT [61]. In this regard it is of interest that fluoroquinolones seem to have less detrimental effects on biodiversity of the fecal flora than beta-lactams. Levofloxacin at a dose of 500 mg/d for patients who are going to be profoundly neutropenic for longer than 1 week is the current recommendation of the IDSA [11].",

Four doses of the vaccine result in enhanced antibody response and tolerable side effects [68]. Antibiotic prophylaxis against S. pneumoniae prophylaxis for adults with active cGVHD has been recommended [69], although there is only weak evidence supporting its efficacy. Penicillin V-K is safe and well tolerated, but the local patterns of penicillin resistance may make other antibiotics (e.g., trimethoprim, sulfamethoxazole, azithromycin, or levofloxacin) preferable, although their long-term safety is not well established.",

Similarly, it is reasonable to question the indication for fluconazole during periods when the main fungal infection is aspergillosis. Several randomized controlled trials have compared fluconazole with another azole with activity against molds (itraconazole [87, 88], voriconazole [89], or posaconazole [90]) either as standard posttransplant prophylaxis or during periods of increased risk. The general conclusion of these trials is that the aspergillus-active drugs are, indeed, more effective than fluconazole in preventing IA, but the benefit in survival in the context of a clinical trial with careful monitoring of galactomannan antigen is hard to demonstrate [91]. The 2009 ASBMT/EBMT Guidelines recommend posaconazole or voriconazole as antifungal prophylaxis in the setting of GVHD and micafungin in the setting of prolonged neutropenia [1]. Of note, posaconazole prophylaxis was superior to fluconazole or itraconazole and improved survival in prolonged neutropenia in non-transplant patients [92]. Now, there are even more options of mold-active prophylaxis with posaconazole delayed-release tablets, intravenous posaconazole, and the new agent isavuconazole.",

Late CMV disease has emerged as a significant problem, as it occurs when patients are not being under close monitoring by the transplant center. Risk factors include lymphopenia and chronic GVHD [103]. Preventing late CMV disease may be accomplished by either prophylaxis with valganciclovir or the preemptive approach with weekly CMV PCR monitoring [104].

Pathologically the spectrum goes from polymorphic, polyclonal tissue infiltration of lymphocytes to monomorphic involvement with high-grade B cell lymphoma. After allogeneic HCT, the proliferating cells may be from donor (most commonly) or recipient origin. This disorder is typically related to insufficient or abnormal T cell responses against EBV [107], and accordingly it is more common in the setting of HLA-mismatched transplants, T cell depletion, or intense immunosuppression for the treatment of GVHD [108\u2013110]. Some cases have followed the use of alemtuzumab for in vivo T cell depletion or GVHD prophylaxis [110], despite the fact that anti-CD52 also results in depletion of B cells and earlier had been reported to be associated with relatively less risk. Interestingly, the use of posttransplant cyclophosphamide to prevent GVHD seems to be associated with lower risk of PTLD [35]. Monitoring of EBV viral load by quantitative PCR is now recommended in those transplants considered at high risk. Preemptive management of increasing EBV viral load in patients at risk has been associated with good outcomes [111], although it is not clear when exactly this treatment should be given. A CT/PET may be useful to localize areas amenable to biopsy (Figure 6-2).\n",

Cases of encephalitis tend to be accompanied by higher viral loads of HHV-6 in plasma [117], but the role of systematic monitoring of HHV-6 in plasma is unknown at this time, as reactivation seems much more common than disease [118] and attempts to use a preemptive strategy using foscarnet have not been successful [119]. The European Conference on Infections in Leukemia has proposed evidence-based guidelines to address the diagnostic and therapeutic uncertainties related to this infection [120].",

Even asymptomatic carriage of respiratory viruses at the time of transplant has been reported to result in increased risk of unfavorable outcomes [122]. Besides respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) [123], influenza, parainfluenza virus (PIV) [124], rhinovirus [125], and adenovirus, newly identified viruses including metapneumovirus [126], coronavirus [127], and bocavirus [128] have emerged as significant pathogens. These infections present significant risks both acutely and in the long term. During the acute infection, HCT recipients are at risk of developing viral pneumonia that sometimes progresses to respiratory insufficiency, mechanical ventilation and death, and also at risk of concomitant or secondary bacterial or fungal infections that are associated with increased mortality [124, 129, 130]. Long-term, there seems to be an association between early infection (pre-day 100) with some of these viruses (most notably PIV and RSV) and later development of chronic airflow obstruction [131]. The most significant risk factor overall for progression of these infections from the upper respiratory tract to the lungs seems to be lymphopenia [132]. Corticosteroid use seems to contribute to progression to pneumonia in RSV and parainfluenza infections but not so in influenza [129, 130] (see Table 6-3).",

They can cause a variety of diseases, including upper and lower respiratory tract infection, colitis, hemorrhagic cystitis (HC), nephropathy, and CNS disease. Systemic adenovirus disease seems to be more common in children, particularly in recipients of cord blood or T cell-depleted transplants [134\u2013136].

Aerosolized pentamidine is convenient, obviates the problem of compliance, and is less toxic than dapsone and better tolerated than atovaquone. However, it has been reportedly associated with more failures than dapsone [150]. Dapsone seemed to be effective and well tolerated in one study [151] but not in another when it was given only three times per week [152]. Dapsone should not be given to patients with G6PD deficiency. Methemoglobinemia is a well-known complication of dapsone [153] that should be considered in the presence of unexplained shortness of breath. Atovaquone suspension 1500 mg/d may be used, but published experience in HSCT recipients is limited [154, 155]. Atovaquone is expensive and poor tolerance has made compliance for some patients difficult. Absorption is better in the presence of significant amount of fat, and breakthroughs are well documented (Figure 6-4). PCP prophylaxis is recommended at least until all immunosuppression has been stopped but it is unclear how much longer to continue it [156].\n",
