The much-quoted pronouncement that \"it is time to close the book on infectious disease\" is usually attributed to former US Surgeon General William Stewart. Although there appears to be no evidence that he ever actually said this, \"the sentiment was certainly widely shared\" at the time (Sassetti and Rubin 2007) . This widespread complacency remained largely unchallenged throughout most of the twentieth century. It was dispelled by the unfolding of HIV pandemic and the plethora of other emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases that followed (or in some cases preceded) it, but it had already contributed to the gross neglect of infectious diseases by bioethicists (Smith et al. 2004; Francis et al. 2005; Selgelid and Selgelid 2005) . AIDS was a rare exception, but many of the ethical issues it raised -confidentiality, discrimination, patients' rights and sexual freedom -were not specifically related to its status as an infectious disease.",

In addition to AIDS, attention has especially focused on severe acquired respiratory syndrome (SARS), pandemic influenza planning and issues related to bioterrorism (Reid 2005; Thompson et al. 2006; Miller et al. 2007 ). There has also been debate about the ethics of issues such as: intellectual property rights, relating to antimicrobial agents and their implications for the access to essential treatment of infectious diseases (Gupta et al. 2005) and the relationship between marketing of antimicrobials and the emergence of antibiotic resistance (Selgelid 2007) .",

Communicable diseases have implications far beyond their effects on individual sufferers and their immediate families. Because they can be rapidly fatal in previously healthy people and their spread is often unpredictable and indiscriminate, they can cause fear, panic, social disruption, political overreaction and victimization, out of proportion to the actual disease burden or risk (Smith et al. 2004) . The explosive, but relatively shortlived, spread and high mortality of SARS in 2003 led to international socioeconomic repercussions affecting tourism, trade and international relations and costing billions of dollars. Disproportionate responses are often exacerbated by the florid language used by media and politicians, with analogies to terrorism or war (\"flesh-eating\"; \"silent killer\"; \"superbug\"; \"plague\"; \"attack\"; \"struck down\").

The former emphasizes the right of individuals to make decisions about their health, based on their own interests or preferences (autonomy), limited only by the potential of those decisions to harm others (the harm principle). The latter is based on utilitarian principles, whereby decisions are determined by the best overall outcomes (in terms of aggregate and/ or average human well-being), even if some individuals may be disadvantaged as a result. Recently, Margaret Battin and colleagues have suggested a new approachthat ethical decision-making about infectious diseases should take place behind a Rawlsian \"veil of ignorance\", a concept developed as the basis for making fair decisions about distributive justice (Battin et al. 2009; Rawls 1971) . They propose that patients with infectious diseases -and indeed anyone -can be seen, actually or potentially, as both a victim and a vector of infection (Battin et al. 2009 ). Behind the \"veil of ignorance\", the decision-maker does not know her actual status -victim and/or vector -but acknowledges that she could be, or could become, either.",

Levels of susceptibility to infection vary between individuals, as determined by, inter alia, where and how they live, their age, underlying health, nutritional status, life-style choices and genetic makeup and the measures they take to protect themselves, such as immunization. No one can be reliably protected from infections due to respiratory viruses, food-borne bacteria or pathogens spread by mosquitoes. Like the patient with fever and cough or diarrhea, each of us is a potential victim and a potential vector. Ethical infectious disease policy will respect the interests of both patients with infections -who want care and protection, without discriminationand of the rest of the community who seek protection from infection. The latter include not only apparently healthy individuals, some of whom are unwitting carriers of potentially dangerous pathogens, but also people at increased risk of infection, because of underlying disease or genetic predisposition.",

Differences in susceptibility to malaria and TB have been recognized between different but closely related ethnic groups (Modiano et al. 1996) ; and large epidemiological, twin and genetic studies have provided insights into the hereditable proportions of susceptibility or resistance to a number of infectious diseases. There are well documented associations between certain human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes and susceptibility to severe malaria, rapid progression of HIV infection to AIDS, development of overt TB disease or leprosy and hepatitis B carriage (Cooke and Hill 2001) . However, HLA genes account for only a small component of genetic susceptibility to infection, which (like many other types of disease) is apparently determined by interactions between many different genes, acquired characteristics (e.g., nutrition, previous exposure) and environmental factors.",

Researchers are using the technique of genome-wide association (GWA) analysis, which involves mapping half a million or more single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in thousands of individuals -without the need for whole genome sequencing -to identify sequence variants that correlate with disease risk, using statistical inferences based on common patterns.",

However, although vaccines are available, they have been less successful in controlling some diseases (e.g., pertussis, TB, influenza), and immunization remains elusive for many (e.g., most respiratory and diarrheal diseases, malaria, and HIV infection). Antimicrobial agents are available for the treatment of many types of infection but, with few exceptions, their efficacy has been compromised by the development of resistance in target pathogens. On the other hand, changes in land and water use, agriculture, animal husbandry, transportation, climate, or lifestyle, as well as increasing numbers of people who are immunocompromised because of AIDS or immunosuppressive drug therapy, have led to the emergence of new and opportunistic human pathogens which were once regarded -if they were recognized at all -as animal, rather than human, pathogens or as harmless commensals.",

Comparison of genomes of different strains of the same and related species can provide extensive information about microbial evolution and the relative importance of different types of genetic variation (e.g., mutation, insertion, deletion, duplication, recombination, or lateral transfer) and how they occur. We now know that many of the genes that determine virulence or antibiotic resistance are transferred on mobile genetic elements (plasmids, bacteriophages, transposons, pathogenicity islands) between different strains or species; this can dramatically amplify the effects of selection pressures (see Chap. 12 for details).

If their benefits are to be fully realized, the predictive values of new tests (i.e., the ability to predict whether or not the patient has the infection which the test is intended to diagnose) must be thoroughly evaluated, with reference to clinical outcomes not just through comparisons with existing diagnostic methods. Moreover, the evaluation should not end with their introduction into routine practice. Currently, the microbiology laboratory's task is to identify a relevant pathogen in a clinical specimen and report it, with an antibiotic susceptibility profile, if appropriate. Conventional diagnostic methods are relatively slow, and the interpretation of results is often subjective. For example, whether or not a pathogen is identified and reported in a culture from a site with normal flora may depend on the skill and experience of the laboratory scientist. The interpretation of the result depends on clinical information, which is often not available to the scientist, and technical information which may not be available to the clinician -such as the type and quality of specimen, diagnostic method used, and the pathogen strain. The clinician's interpretation of the result will often determine the antibiotic choice, but if this is inappropriate, the outcome may be compromised (Khatib et al. 2006; Chapman et al. 2008) .",

            "text": "Properly designed clinical research studies (currently, a rarity in diagnostic microbiology) will clarify the circumstances in which the detection of virulence or antibiotic resistance markers in mixed flora is significant (Table 20 .1). For example, genes that encode resistance to newer b-lactamase and carbapenem antibiotics or vancomycin are often carried in commensal gut flora, but can be transferred to virulent Gram negative bacilli (such as Enterobacteriaceae) or enterococci, respectively, under selection pressure from antibiotic therapy (Chapman et al. 2008; Iredell et al. 2006) . Multiresistant Enterobacteriaceae or vancomycin resistant enterococci (VRE) are much more likely SCCmec is the staphylococcal cassette chromosome (a mobile genetic element), which carries the methicillin resistance gene mecA than commensal or environmental bacteria to cause disease or spread to other patients and are more difficult to treat than their antibiotic susceptible counterparts. However, even after careful evaluation, in a research setting, there are pitfalls in the translation of new diagnostic methods into practice. Although the interpretation of conventional microbiological results is often empirical and subjective, it is based on years of experience. Faster and more sensitive methods will provide more information, more timely and reproducible results and detection of a broader range of pathogens than conventional methods; they may uncover new infectious disease syndromes or identify previously unrecognized carriers. Confirmation that a new (and usually more expensive) assay will improve clinical outcomes requires ongoing prospective analysis of reliability and cost-effectiveness, which is difficult in a diagnostic laboratory setting. However, without it, the use of new assays could lead to unnecessary therapy or medicalization of \"normal\" conditions. For example, screening patients for carriage of multiresistant organisms, such as methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) using rapid NAD methods, can improve hospital infection control by allowing more timely and appropriate isolation of patients and can guide appropriate antibiotic therapy. However, the sensitivity and specificity of some NAD methods differ from those of conventional methods, leading to potentially adverse consequences. Failure to identify some carriers (Thomas et al. 2008 ) will increase the risk of transmission to other patients. On the other hand if NAD assays identify more carriers than conventional methods, it can be difficult to distinguish increased sensitivity from false positive results. Either way, it will mean that more patients will be isolated, possibly unnecessarily (Humphreys 2008) , which is costly, can adversely affect clinical care (Stelfox et al. 2003 ) and may cause unnecessary anxiety.",

As part of this assessment, the point at which clinical research -with its ethical safeguards such as the informed consent of subjects -merges into routine practice will need to be defined. We need to develop standards for interpretation and reporting of the results of new diagnostic tests, in consultation with clinicians, to improve consistency. At present, introduction of new diagnostic and screening methods generally occurs independently in individual laboratories; test evaluation is often limited to comparison with existing methods and continued satisfactory performance in quality assurance programs, as required by accreditation bodies. Differences between methods used by different accredited laboratories suggest that some are \"better\" than others, but this information is not readily accessible to clinicians or patients and the criteria on which choices are based are often poorly defined. New tests are usually more expensive that conventional methods. It is usually assumed -and often true -that any increased costs are justified by better patient outcomes and savings elsewhere, but formal cost-effectiveness studies that are needed to confirm this are rarely done. Even if extensive evaluation demonstrates that a new method can improve patient outcomes and/or reduce costs, introduction of the test is often prevented or delayed because of the difficulty of transferring costs (and savings) between cost centers.",

For many notifiable infectious diseases, simple species identification of the pathogen is inadequate and strain typing is required to monitor trends or to investigate outbreaks. However, until recently, the efficacy of surveillance has been limited by the fact that conventional strain typing methods are relatively slow, insensitive, and often performed only by specialized public health laboratories. Recent developments in microbial genomics have led to the development of faster and more discriminatory methods (see Chap. 2, 4, and 17), but their introduction has been limited and haphazard, in part because of inadequate recognition of the importance of improved strain typing methods, for disease control.",

However, communicable disease surveillance often requires individual patient identification to allow contact tracing, outbreak investigation and the implementation of appropriate control measures and to determine the outcomes. For example, under the NSW Public Health Act, 1991 (http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/pha1991126/), disclosure of certain data is allowed, but there are strict principles governing the collection, storage, access and use of information. In practice, there is little public opposition to the notification of identifiable, personal information to health authorities for communicable disease surveillance, which is accepted as necessary in the public interest. However, this may be, in part, because current communicable disease surveillance systems are generally slow, insensitive, and nonspecific. They are relatively ineffective in detecting, preventing, or interrupting disease outbreaks (Eng and Eng 2004) but also difficult for unauthorized individuals to access and use inappropriately. Thus, privacy is protected by \"information friction\" (Dyson 2008) . The type of future networked EPRs and databases envisaged in the scenario above will be more effective than conventional systems, but potentially more at risk of abuse, with more serious consequences.",

However, improvements in disease control, based on efficient surveillance across large populations could not be achieved if large numbers of people refused to participate because of fear that results could be misused. Denmark has one of the most advanced EPR networks, which allows individuals to block information in their records. This option is reported to be rarely exercised but greatly valued (Rothstein 2008) . At present, the disclosure of health information for public benefit is often regulated by laws that are so broad that, in practice, no limits are placed on their scope. EPR networks could, paradoxically, protect privacy more effectively, by allowing limits to be imposed on the scope of data that could be accessed. Scanning software could be programmed to select only information relevant to a specific purpose, using 'contextual access criteria' -software algorithms which specify that, for an enquiry of type X, only data A, B, and C are needed.",

Informed consent for individual investigations or routine surveillance would be impracticable.

Laboratory information systems can be used by health authorities to monitor the quality of patient care in individual hospitals (Fairweather and Rogerson 2001) by gathering statistics about infections which develop after a patient's admission to hospital -such as S. aureus or specifically MRSA blood stream infections. This has benefits for both potential patients and the general public who arguably have a right to information about the quality of care in hospitals to which they may be admitted in future. In some countries, data related to HAIs are publicly reported, and the occurrence of cases judged to be preventable may incur penalties. For example, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) in the USA have recently announced that they will no longer reimburse healthcare facilities for costs related to certain HAIs that could have reasonably been prevented through the use of evidence-based guidelines (http://www.idsociety.org/newsArticle.aspx?id = 6,852).",

Research ethics has traditionally been a central theme of bioethics discourse, for which monitoring guidelines and procedures are well established in health and research institutions, but the ethics of disease surveillance is a relatively unexplored area in need of debate. On the one hand, there are questions about the technical similarities and/or differences between surveillance and research and how they affect practice, if at all (Fairchild and Bayer 2004) . In theory, these may be the questions of definition and semantics, but there are currently major differences, which may or may not be justified, in the way these two areas are perceived by practitioners and funding bodies. From an ethical perspective, the key question is whether there are morally relevant differences between research and surveillance such that the ethical requirements for the former should not also apply to the latter. According to research ethics, for example, informed consent is paramount and the interests of the individual are supposed to take priority over those of science or society (Declaration of Helsinki -available at: http:// www.wma.net/e/policy/b3.htm). Given that research and surveillance are similar insofar as both aim to generate information to promote health outcomes, the crucial questions are whether, why and how much, if at all, ethical requirements for disease surveillance should be less stringent than those of biomedical research.",
