            "text": "Allotransplantation can be associated with transmission of microorganisms which induce severe diseases in the recipient [1,2]. Among the transmitted microorganisms are bacteria [3] and viruses such as the human immunodeficiency virus-1 [4], rabies virus [5,6,7], and human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) [8]. Infection with HCMV is a common complication after transplantation of different organs and contributes significantly to morbidity and mortality, both by direct and indirect mechanisms [9]. Therefore, HCMV status has to be determined and transplantations from HCMV-positive individuals to HCMV-negative individuals are generally avoided (for review see [8,9]). If necessary, an antiviral treatment is available and new antiviral drugs are under development [10]. Xenotransplantation using pig cells, tissues, and organs may also be associated with transmission of microorganisms, including bacteria, viruses, and others from the donor pig [11]. Transmission of porcine cytomegalovirus (PCMV) with the transplant and its increased replication, also called reactivation, on the background of the absence of the pig immune system and of the applied immunosuppression in the non-human primate recipient, was observed after pig kidney transplantations into baboons [12] or cynomolgus monkeys [13]. Transmission of PCMV was also observed after pig heart transplantations into baboons [14]. Although the virus titre in the recipients increases, it is unclear whether PCMV is able to infect cells of the recipient or is replicating only in the cells of the transplant.",

            "text": "There are obvious differences between the transmission inside the human species during allotransplantation and transspecies transmission into a new species during xenotransplantation. Human microorganisms are adapted to humans and can be easily transmitted [1,2,3,4,8,9]. The porcine microorganisms are not adapted to humans, and it is clear that many of them cannot infect human cells due to the absence of a receptor or due to cellular factors restricting replication in human cells. In contrast to human pathogens, sensitive detection methods for porcine microorganisms were developed only in a few specialized laboratories, and it is unclear whether commercial test laboratories can detect low virus load infections, as shown in one case of PCMV infection [15]. Sending identical virus dilutions to different laboratories worldwide for testing, so called round robin tests, may answer this question. The results of the testing will indicate the sensitivity of their methods. In this context, in a recent round robin or ring test including 11 North American laboratories, the most sensitive assay detected DNA levels of a porcine virus about 100,000 times lower than the least sensitive assay [16]. This study demonstrated that the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays available in these diagnostic labs vary considerably in their detection limits and quantification.",

            "text": "The porcine circoviruses (PCVs) belong to the genus Circovirus of the family Circoviridae [18]. Porcine circovirus 1 (PCV1) was first described at the Robert Koch Institute, Berlin [19]. Other members of this family are PCV2, several avian circoviruses [18], and recently new circoviruses have been isolated from mammals: bat [20,21], dogs [22,23,24,25], mink [26,27], and others. Circoviruses are non-enveloped spherical (16\u201318 nm) particles (Figure 1) with a single-stranded and circular small DNA genome. PCVs are the smallest viruses found to be replicating in mammalian cells. PCVs are quite stable, the effectiveness of disinfectants for reducing PCV2 in vitro is variable and PCV2 is very stable in the pig environment. The virus is very resistant under high temperatures and a wide range of pH conditions (for review see [28]). Two major open reading frames (orfs) have been recognized. Orf1 encodes the two replicases indispensable for viral replication (Rep and Rep\u2019), and orf2 encodes the capsid protein Cap, which is the major structural protein [29]. Three other genes, orf3, orf4, and orf5 encode proteins not essential for virus replication, but involved in the virulence and spread of the virus [30,31]. Cells of the monocyte and macrophage lineage have consistently been shown to be targets for porcine circovirus replication in vivo, and appear to be important in the pathogenesis of the postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS) [32,33,34]. Additionally, a variety of other cell types, including hepatocytes, enterocytes, renal and alveolar epithelial cells, vascular endothelial cells, pancreatic acinar and ductular cells, lymphocytes, smooth muscle cells, and fibroblasts, have also been shown to contain PCV2 antigens and/or nucleic acid [35]. It was shown that heparin, heparan sulphate, and chondroitin sulphate are attachment factors for PCV2 [36], whereas the main receptor is still unknown [37].",

            "text": "PCV1 is apathogenic in pigs, but PCV2 is associated with severe diseases, among them PMWS, which is considered the most significant PCV2-related disease (PCVD) (see Section 3). PCV2 is an immunosuppressive virus, targeting the lymphoid tissues, which leads to lymphoid depletion and immunosuppression in pigs. The virus resides in immune cells, such as macrophage and dendritic cells, and modulates their functions. Upregulation of interleukin (IL)-10 and proinflammatory cytokines in infected pigs may contribute to pathogenesis and co-infection with other pathogens. PCV2 DNA and proteins interact with various cellular genes that control immune responses [38,39,40]. Although numerous reviews summarise the impact of PCV2 on pig production and give detailed descriptions of the pathogenesis of PCV2-induced diseases in pigs [40,41,42,43], this review is the first to analyse the potential impact of PCV2 on xenotransplantation, and to analyse whether PCV2 may represent a risk for xenotransplantation. PCV2 induces severe diseases in pigs, but it remains unclear whether subclinical infections may reduce the quality of the pig transplants, particularly because the virus is immunosuppressive. Vaccination against PCV2 is able to prevent diseases, but in most cases is unable to prevent the transmission of the virus (for details see Section 6). Using sensitive methods will increase the probability of detecting the virus. However, it remains unclear how sensitive these methods should be. At the very least, in order to prevent transmission during xenotransplantation, the sensitivity of the detection methods should allow for the detection of the virus below the load which is able to be transmitted and to induce zoonosis [44]. We also indicate different strategies to eliminate the viruses from the donor pig herd in order to prevent transmission to human recipients.",

In some cases, PCVs were detected simultaneously with other porcine viruses using multiplex PCR [51,52]. Other detection methods are antibody-based methods such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), Western blot analysis, and immunofluorescence [53,54,55,56,57,58]. The use of saliva for antibody detection gained popularity because of the ease of use and associated cost-saving [59]. Serum antibodies to PCV1 and PCV2 have been demonstrated in a large percentage of pigs in different countries at a time when vaccination had not yet been introduced [60]. PCR screening in the year 2000 of randomly collected 109 organ samples from German pigs not affected with PCVD revealed a rate of infection with PCV1 of 5% and with PCV2 of 26.8% [46]. Seroconversion usually occurs by two to four months of age irrespective of whether clinical signs of PCVD are observed. PCV2 is shed for a long time by different routes, both after natural as well as experimental infection [61,62]. Therefore, it easily spreads within the population, mainly by direct contact with contaminated respiratory, digestive, and urinary secretions. Although PCV2 has been identified in the semen of acutely affected boars, transmission of the virus via this route has not been documented in a field setting [63,64].",

PCV2d was initially identified in Switzerland, now it appears to be widespread in China and North America. During 2012\u20132013, 37% of all investigated PCV2 sequences from U.S. pigs were classified as PCV2d, and overall data analysis suggests an ongoing genotype shift from PCV2b towards PCV2d [70].

PCV3 was found to be associated with porcine dermatitis and nephropathy syndrome (PDNS), reproductive failure, and multisystemic inflammation in China [75,76] and in the USA [77]. Sequence analysis showed that the Chinese isolates are the result of a recombination between bat circoviruses [76], and the closest relative of the U.S.A. isolate is a canine circovirus [77].",

However, PCV2 induces an entire complex of diseases now called PCVD in Europe or PCV-associated disease (PCVAD) in North America [33]. PCVD can be subdivided into PCV2-systemic disease (PCV2-SD, directly replacing PMWS), PCV2-subclinical infection (PCV2-SI), PCV2-reproductive disease (PCV2-RD), and PDNS. PCV2 is necessary but not sufficient for the induction of PCVD. Some purported risk factors include coinfection with other viruses. Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is one of these viruses, it causes the porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome associated with reproductive failure in breeding stocks and respiratory tract illness in young pigs. Co-infection with porcine parvovirus may also contribute to PCVD as well as nonspecific immune stimulation (e.g., by vaccination).",

Both contaminated vaccines had been used world-wide for a number of years, preventing disease and saving millions of children\u2019s lives [89,90]. Over 105 or 106 particle-associated full-length PCV1 genomes were present in each dose of the contaminated vaccine [83,87,88,89], and cell culture assays in swine testis and PCV-free porcine kidney (PK-15) cells confirmed that PCV1 sequences in this vaccine represented infectious virus [86,87,88,91]. Another rotavirus vaccine contained only subgenomic PCV1 and PCV2 fragments, but no full-length PCV genomes, and cell culture assays did not amplify PCV from this vaccine [88]. When stool samples from children vaccinated with Rotarix, an oral live attenuated vaccine based on the human rotavirus RIX4414 produced by GlaxoSmithKline (London, UK), were analyzed, in 4 of 40 samples PCV1 DNA was detected [83]. PCV1 DNA was detected only soon after vaccination, indicating that viral replication did not occur in the gastrointestinal tract. Antibodies were not detected in the sera of vaccinated children, confirming that no replication of the virus had taken place. The pattern of adverse events reported in vaccinated infants with PCV1 in their stool did not differ from that observed in placebo recipients [83]. This correlated with the reports that the Rotarix vaccine in general had nearly no adverse events [89,90].",

Auckland Island pigs were used as source for the first clinical pig islet cell transplantation to human diabetic patients in New Zealand and Argentina [93,94,95,96]. These donor animals were free of PCV1 and PCV2, and therefore could not transmit circoviruses [94]. The sensitivity of the PCR used to detect PCV in Auckland Island pigs was estimated to be 106 mg of DNA per reaction [97]. Islet cells from Auckland Island pigs were also used in a prospective pig-to-primate islet xenotransplantation study, and as expected, no PCV was transmitted [98]. In most of the reported pig-to-non-human primate transplantations, no screening for PCV was performed, with the exception of a the just mentioned trial transplanting islet cells from Auckland Island pigs into cynomolgus monkeys [98]. In addition, pig donors for islet cell transplantation into mice had also been found to be PCV-negative [99]. Recently, islet cells from Large White/Yorkshire landrace F1 pigs were transplanted into non-immunosuppressed cynomolgus monkeys, and no PCV was detected in the recipients [100]. Testing was performed based on the presence of PCV in the source herd, although the donor pigs had been vaccinated with CircoFLEX (Table 1). PCV was not tested in the monthly herd screening and in the sentinel and pancreas donor post-mortem screening, the islet cells had been encapsulated in macrobeads.",

All in/all out pig flow, thorough cleaning, and rigid disinfection between batches of pigs are measures that can help control the disease [103]. In the case that the donor animal is PCV-infected, it may be considered to analyze whether the xenotransplantation product (e.g., isolated islet cells) is still negative. Since PCV2 is infecting macrophages, certainly all organs are infected and it will be safer to use only negative animals, especially since no effective antiviral treatment is available. PCV2 infection is associated with an immune response including neutralising antibodies, and these coincide with a decrease in serum virus load. Cell-mediated immunity has also been shown to be necessary to control PCV2 infection (for review see [102]). PCV2 vaccines became commercially available in the summer of 2006 (Table 1) [103]. The vaccines reduced the severity and incidence rate of PCVD on many farms. Vaccination against PCV2 did not only imply a direct beneficial effect on pig productivity, but also contributed to reduction of antimicrobial use [104]. PCV2 vaccines effectively increased average daily weight gain (ADWG) and prevented diseases with a positive result for meat production. In all vaccination trials a lower virus load was registered in the vaccinated animals, however, it remains unclear whether the virus load is reduced to zero. In most reported cases, virus transmission took place despite vaccination [102,105,106,107]. In a study vaccinating 28 pigs, the virus load was not reduced to zero in any of the animals [108]. In another study, 17 of 32 vaccinated animals still showed PCV in the serum, as measured by PCR [90]. PCV2 vaccination of sows was associated with high antibody responses, but did not prevent fetal infections in utero or soon after birth by infectious colostrum in 29 of 100 cases [107]. When comparing four different vaccines, use of the inactivated chimeric vaccines (Fostera PCV and Circovax) resulted in significantly lower viremia compared with use of the subunit vaccines (Circoflex, Porcilis PCV), however, histopathological lesions and PCV antigens were still detected in all 80 immunized animals [109]. Successful vaccination is mainly associated with induction of neutralizing antibodies, but T cell-mediated immunity also plays a role in the reduction of the virus load and prevention of diseases as mentioned above [102,110].",

Elimination programs in the case of circoviruses should be based on (i) selection of animals found non-infected using highly sensitive detection methods to avoid false-negative testing; (ii) vaccination or other strategies (see below), since treatment is not available; and (iii) isolation of virus-negative animals to prevent de novo infection. Elimination means elimination from the herd, elimination from a single individual is impossible, since there is no treatment presently available. The efficacy of the vaccines should be improved and new vaccines against emerging variant virus strains should be developed. Since PCV2 is easily transmitted through the placenta and since colostrum was shown to be infectious, Cesarean section, and colostrum derivation are two promising strategies to eliminate PCV [80,106,107,113]. Recent findings of PCV2 in G\u00f6ttingen Minipigs [114], which were introduced into the facility by Cesarean delivery and are produced under specified pathogen-free breeding conditions that are very similar to designated pathogen-free breeding conditions [115], confirm transmission through the placenta and indicate that selection of PCV2-free animals may be difficult. However, when 384 embryos recovered from PCV2 infected pigs 10 days after inoculation were transferred to seronegative donors, no infection of the recipient pig and the piglets was observed, indicating that embryo transfer can be successfully used for the elimination of PCV2 [116].",

PCV2 is an immunosuppressive virus and it is still unclear whether subclinical infections of pigs may decrease the functionality of the organs required for transplantation. Vaccination against PCV2 is able to prevent diseases, but in most cases is unable to prevent the transmission of the virus. Although PCV2 infects human cells and induces a cytopathic effect in vitro, no pathogenic effects were observed when PCV was transmitted by contaminated vaccines to children. It remains unknown whether PCV may infect severely immunosuppressed individuals. In conclusion, for all of these reasons, sensitive detection methods should be used to screen for the virus and improved vaccination, Cesarean delivery, colostrum deprivation, and embryo transfer should be used to prevent transmission of the virus.",
