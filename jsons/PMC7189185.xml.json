I vividly recall discussing two of his little-known articles with John. These buried treasures are worth recalling because of their significance to me, as well as what I believe they represent for quality improvement. The first was a 1983 article on what John dubbed \u201cderived thresholds.\u201d1 Instead of approaching so-called test-treat thresholds (how likely a disease should be for a clinician to consider ordering a diagnostic test or treatment) as something mandated from above, he showed it was possible and worthwhile to study front-line clinicians\u2019 actual ordering practices to infer best practices (in other words, to derive the thresholds from observing practice patterns)\u2014a very radical idea, when you think about it. The second article was his 1988 commentary titled \u201cClinical Scholars and Their Program: Children of the Sixties in the Eighties.\u201d2 Here he traces the contribution of 1960s activism, including his own, to informing and motivating a generation of health services researchers and quality improvement (QI) scholars.",

It was a time when there was liberal prescribing of drugs such as benzodiazepines (to treat everyday anxiety, relax muscles, or deal with ulcers or MI stresses) and estrogens (the number one drug prescribed to women, promoted as helping women prevent cancer and MIs and remain \u201cfeminine forever\u201d), and widespread use of potent cardiac antiarrhythmic drugs (which had serious adverse effects but minimal evidence to support their efficacy, and were found to actually increase mortality).3, 4, 5, 6 It led us, as medical students and later as residents and attendings, to question the overpromotion, overuse, and safety of such prescriptions and seek ways to make prescribing safer. The Joint Commission recognized this safety need and mandated that each hospital review their use of medications with an eye to safer prescribing. Cook County Hospital set up a Drug Utilization Review Committee, and I became its first chair. We examined prescribing patterns by downloading data from the Cook County pharmacy's comprehensive dispensing database (since County's indigent patients obtained virtually all of their medications for free from the Hospital's outpatient pharmacy, this provided a comprehensive look at their drug prescriptions) and found many improvement opportunities. We also linked lab data (manually at first; later electronically) to the pharmacy data; one finding was that more than half of the theophylline-toxic patients continued to receive IV infusions more than 10 hours after the toxic sample was drawn, and many patients were experiencing GI, neuro-psychiatric, and cardiac symptoms that were not recognized as being caused by theophylline toxicity.7\n",

The local district attorney charged the three nurses involved in the error with criminally negligent homicide. Using their process-oriented taxonomy as a lens to understand the error, ISMP found a very different picture.31 Examining each step (prescribing, transcribing (this was prior to CPOE), dispensing, and administering), they found dozens of process errors and system failures at each step, including that the treatment itself was not necessary in the first place! (The Spanish-speaking mother had already been treated with penicillin, thus there was no need to treat the infant.)",

But, as proud as we are to have made this contribution, I must confess this taxonomy was actually (at least in its origins) more of a retreat than a confident step forward. When the DEER investigators met each week to review cases in an attempt to understand their causes and ways to prevent the errors, we faced real challenges. We had trouble agreeing whether there was an error, or even what the correct diagnosis was and whether/when it should have been made sooner.9 So we decided to step back to at least try to localize what went wrong in the diagnostic process.",

The way this help should work is that the user would first show the support person what they had done to try to make the EMR behave to accomplish the desired task. No more \u201call you had to do is xyz,\u201d (rarely obvious in our non-intuitive systems). Rather the support person should record those attempted steps to take back to the organization and vendors\u2019 human factors engineers to continuously analyze, collate, and learn from the collective frustrations of EMR users. Aggregated data from these help-desk calls should be made publicly available, transparent, and accountable for researchers, regulators, and consumers. We collected help-desk data and safety reports related to electronic prescribing and found a wealth of questions and frustrations that had safety implications.33 The purpose of this type of transparent, accountable learning system isn't just to make doctors happier or less frustrated; it is to redesign the systems to make them safer and more efficient for everyone.

However, preventing widespread indiscriminate misuse of the \u201clatest and greatest\u201d technologies that lack evidence of benefit and/or are harming patients, can potentially save many more lives. It is nice to have an award recognizing this. We are also pleased that the IHI Open School has recognized the importance of conservative prescribing and has just gone live with an Open School Course that we helped prepare devoted to teaching conservative prescribing principles.",

            "text": "Thank- you for this question, which feels like a perfect way to conclude our conversation. I had not planned to have clinician-patient relationships as one my areas of quality and safety research; it was thrust on me by a series of events calling into question my own behavior and care for my primary care patients.45 I had assumed that applying QI principles in very personal ways to my everyday care was part of putting into practice the type of patient-centered care the IOM advocated in their landmark Crossing the Quality Chasm report.46\n,\n47 The IOM proposed ten new rules to guide patient-clinician relationships that emphasized care based on continuous healing relationships and responding to patients\u2019 preferences, values and needs. For me, that meant genuinely knowing my patients and, where needed, going the extra mile to help them, even if that meant stepping out of the traditional doctor role of making diagnoses or writing prescriptions. It means on rare occasions helping them pay for medicines or a ride home, visiting them at their homes, helping them get a job, sharing music, attending weddings, graduations, bar-mitzvahs, or funerals. Although it's necessary to be mindful of boundary issues and power disparities, such human relationships would seem to be an essential part of good quality care. Yet it turns out this touches a raw nerve in medicine related to real controversies, which we have explored in recently published research.48 There is a clash between rules that rigidly proscribe certain behaviors, and what I would argue is a more ethical, commonsense approach that weighs risks and benefits and takes into consideration the context of our actions. To re-humanize medicine, we will need to put the patients, not the rules, at the center. If we are guided by a sense of social solidarity,49 this can bring us closer to our patients, while giving more meaning to and energizing our work. I believe John Eisenberg wouldn't want it any other way.",
