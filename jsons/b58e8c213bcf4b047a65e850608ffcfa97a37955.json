The work status was also recorded. Results: Serial assessments were completed by 55 of the 123 (39.9%) subjects, of whom 27 were health-care workers (HCW). The mean age of the group was 44.4 (SD 13.2) years and 19 (34.5%) were males. At 24 months, 10 (18.2%), 9 (16.4%), 6 (10.9%) and 29 (52.7%) subjects had FEV1, FVC, TLC and DLCO < 80% of predicted values, respectively. The mean (SD) 6MWD increased significantly from 439.0 (89.1) m at 3 months to 460.1 (102.8) m at 6 months (P 0.016) and became steady after 6 months. However, 6MWD and 36 item Short Form General Health Survey scores were lower than the normal population throughout the study. Moreover, 29.6% of HCW and 7.1% of non-HCW had not returned to work 2 years after illness onset. Conclusions: This 2-year study of a selected population of SARS survivors, showed significant impairment of DLCO, exercise capacity and health status persisted, with a more marked adverse impact among HCW.",

[4] [5] [6] [7] [8] As SARS is a disease that has recently emerged, the long-term sequelae are largely unclear. Studies on the lung function outcome of SARS survivors have been reported; [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] however, the longest duration of follow up was around 3 years and small numbers of subjects were studied. 18, 19 We have previously reported the 6 month 12 and 1 year outcomes 13 from the Prince of Wales Hospital SARS patient cohort, based on the available normative lung function data collected in the 1960s. 20, 21 The objectives of the present study were to evaluate the 2-year outcome of lung function, exercise capacity, health and work status of SARS survivors based on updated normative lung function data collected in Hong Kong (HK) from 2001-2003. 22, 23 The patients came from our previously reported cohort 12, 13, 24 admitted over a period of 2 weeks from March 11 to March 25, 2003 . The diagnosis of SARS was based on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria at the time. 25 All patients in this study had subsequent laboratory confirmation of SARS. 26 The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Chinese University of Hong Kong.",

In addition, only 78% of SARS survivors had returned to work and 29% of the HCW had not resumed duty. With more than one half of the patients having abnormal DLCO at 24 months, the data suggest impairment in the intra-alveolar diffusion pathway. Su et al. 18 reported 8/13 (61.5%) patients in Taiwan and Liu et al. 19 reported 5.4% of 39 patients in Beijing who had impairment in DLCO at 14 months and 36 months, respectively. However, these two studies were limited by very small sample sizes of highly selected patients. 18, 19 The static trend of DLCO impairment over 24 months in the current study was different from other long-term follow-up studies that showed improvement in DLCO over 1 year in Singapore, 16 and in Beijing. 17, 19 This might be explained by different methodologies in measuring DLCO among the studies. Studies of ARDS survivors unrelated to SARS have shown significant restrictive and obstructive impairment in pulmonary function tests. [32] [33] [34] Up to 76% of ARDS survivors at 5 years after recovery had impairment in DLCO. 34 It is difficult to interpret the clinical significance of the trend of KCO found, as the alveolar volume effect has not been validated in lung diseases in which lung pathology has reduced carbon monoxide (CO) uptake properties as well as alveolar volume. 35, 36 All the spirometric and lung volume parameters remained static during the study period except for a decreasing trend in the mean of the forced expiratory flow (FEF)%25-75. The percentages of patients with spirometry and lung volume impairment and restrictive abnormality at 24 months were similar to the previous 3-12 month follow-up studies on SARS survivors. 9, 11, 15 The overall pattern of lung function impairment in our study suggests small airway disease and impairment in the diffusion pathway in the SARS survivors. There were 33% and 27.8% of SARS survivors who had abnormal total CXR scores at 6 months and 12 months, respectively, in our cohort. 12, 13 The lung function impairment findings are consistent with the CT images of SARS survivors showing persistent ground glass opacity, reticular opacities and traction bronchiectasis suggesting fibrosis. [37] [38] [39] Despite the absence of bronchiolitis in the imaging of SARS patients during the acute phase, air trapping was often present and persisted in the CT scanning of SARS survivors 6 months post-infection. These findings probably reflected damage to the ciliated respiratory epithelia during the acute disease but were radiologically occult in most patients. 39 Our findings are also consistent with the histological features of SARS cases. The predominant pathological finding in SARS was diffuse alveolar damage in the early phase of the disease 24 but in the later course of disease, dense septal and alveolar fibrosis were seen. 40 A direct correlation was found between the extent of fibrosis and the duration of the illness. 41, 42 The restrictive abnormality of lung function might have also been partially due to respiratory muscle weakness, as demonstrated by persistent abnormal PEmax and decreasing trend of PImax over 24 months.",

            "text": "Previous studies on SARS survivors have reported persistent impairment in exercise capacity up to 14 months post-illness. 12, 13, 15, 18 This observation was similar to that of survivors of ARDS unrelated to SARS. 4, 33 The decrease in exercise capacity has been attributed to several factors. Diffusion impairment and respiratory muscle weakness might result in exertional dyspnoea and limit performance of 6MWT. However, the reduced exercise capacity after hospital discharge in SARS survivors could not be accounted for by impairment of pulmonary function alone, 12, 13, 18, 19 whereas extra-pulmonary causes such as physical deconditioning, muscle weakness and poor motivation were contributing factors. Several reasons for muscle weakness were suggested, including viral-induced myositis at initial presentation, muscle wasting and deconditioning due to prolonged bed rest, steroid myopathy and critical illnessassociated poly-neuropathy or myopathy. 12, 13, 18, 19, 43 The persistent impairment of 6MWD was an important contributor to the reduced quality of life over 24 months. In addition to the physical impairment, mental impairment is expected as the major SARS outbreak in 2003 was a traumatic experience for the SARS survivors. 44 A striking finding was that 10 patients in our cohort had suffered from depression or post-traumatic stress disorder requiring psychiatric support. This finding was echoed by the observation that 10-18% of SARS survivors in HK had symptoms related to post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety and depression. 44 Among SARS survivors in Canada, psychiatrist consultations accounted for the greatest numbers of health-care visits. 15 Similarly impaired health status was reported in ARDS survivors unrelated to SARS. 4, 8, 33, 34 It was reported that 66% of SARS patients in Canada had returned to full-time work 1 year after SARS. 15 Our study had higher percentages of patients returning to work at 1 and 2 years. Studies on ARDS unrelated to SARS have reported that 49% and 65% of ARDS survivors returned to full-time work at 1 year and 2 years, respectively. 4, 33 In our study, the lower percentage of HCW returning to work compared with non-HCW may be explained by the profound psychological trauma of the SARS outbreak at our hospital that involved a high percentage of HCW. 24 HCW with SARS had significantly higher stress levels, higher depression, anxiety and post-traumatic symptoms 1 year after the outbreak than non-health-care SARS survivors. 45 There are several limitations to this study. First, although this study had the largest sample size for a 2-year follow-up study, only 55 of the 123 (39.9%) survivors in the early cohort 24 completed serial assessments over 24 months. The high default rate was likely to be related to patients' efforts to reduce the SARS-associated stigma. 46 Those who had returned for follow up had more severe disease at onset and lower lung function parameters at 3 months. The results might therefore not be representative of the entire cohort. Second, 27% of SARS survivors in our cohort had medical comorbidities. This might have introduced additional impairment of exercise capacity and health status. Third, cardiopulmonary exercise testing was not performed in this study as most patients complained of generalized muscle weakness on initial follow up. 12, 13 As a result, the extrapulmonary factors contributing to the 6MWT could not be measured. Finally, respiratory muscle strength was assessed by mouth pressure in our study. Low PEmax or PImax values might be due to poor motivation and technical difficulties such as mouth leakage. 30 In summary, 2 years after SARS onset, more than 50% of this highly selected group of SARS survivors had impairment in DLCO. Their exercise capacity and health status were remarkably lower than that of the general population and 30% of HCW had not returned to work. SARS can lead to persistent mental and physical abnormalities in survivors, with a greater adverse impact on HCW. Health authorities should provide good support and follow up for these patients including HCW.",
