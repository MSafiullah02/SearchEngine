Confirmed modes of viral transmission are primarily, but not exclusively, contact with contaminated environmental surfaces and aerosolization. Evidence-based improvement strategies for attenuation of residual environmental contamination involve a combination of deep cleaning with surface disinfectants and ultraviolet light (UV-C). (1) Place alcohol-based hand rubs on the intravenous (IV) pole to the left of the provider. Double glove during induction. (2) Place a wire basket lined with a zip closure plastic bag on the IV pole to the right of the provider. Place all contaminated instruments in the bag (eg, laryngoscope blades and handles) and close. Designate and maintain clean and dirty areas. After induction of anesthesia, wipe down all equipment and surfaces with disinfection wipes that contain a quaternary ammonium compound and alcohol. Use a top-down cleaning sequence adequate to reduce bioburden. Treat operating rooms using UV-C. (3) Decolonize patients using preprocedural chlorhexidine wipes, 2 doses of nasal povidone-iodine within 1 hour of incision, and chlorhexidine mouth rinse. (4) Create a closed lumen IV system and use hub disinfection. (5) Provide data feedback by surveillance of Enterococcus, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella, Acinetobacter, Pseudomonas, and Enterobacter spp. (ESKAPE) transmission. (6) To reduce the use of surgical masks and to reduce potential COVID-19 exposure, use relatively long (eg, 12 hours) staff shifts. If there are 8 essential cases to be done (each lasting 1-2 hours), the ideal solution is to have 2 teams complete the 8 cases, not 8 first case starts. (7) Do 1 case in each operating room daily, with terminal cleaning after each case including UV-C or equivalent. (8) Do not have patients go into a large, pooled phase I postanesthesia care unit because of the risk of contaminating facility at large along with many staff. Instead, have most patients recover in the room where they had surgery as is done routinely in Japan. These 8 programmatic recommendations stand on a substantial body of empirical evidence characterizing the epidemiology of perioperative transmission and infection development made possible by support from the Anesthesia Patient Safety Foundation (APSF). (Anesth Analg XXX;XXX:00-00) many if not all patients could be at high risk of viral carriage community spread. This could lead to environmental contamination and subsequent patient and provider workspace exposure.

While our recommendations can be applied to operative care of patients suspected or known to be infected with COVID-19, these patients represent only the tip of the iceberg. Testing every patient for COVID-19 has economic and logistic considerations that are likely to be unachievable in the short term and unsustainable for the long term.

            "text": "Confirmed modes of viral transmission (eg, influenza A and severe acute respiratory syndrome [SARS]) are primarily but not exclusively contact with contaminated environmental surfaces (fomites) and aerosolization. [2] [3] [4] Viral pathogen survival on environmental surfaces extends for several days; COVID-19 can survive for at least 3 days on a variety of materials commonly encountered in ORs (eg, stainless steel, plastic). 5 Usual OR and recovery cleaning practices, especially for noncritical items such as near bedside equipment, are often inadequate. [6] [7] [8] This is a significant issue for both patients and providers because of current cleaning failures and/or lapses in practice that increase the risk of cross-contamination during patient care. [5] [6] [7] [8] Evidence-based improvement strategies for attenuation of residual environmental contamination involve a combination of deep cleaning with surface disinfectants and ultraviolet light (UV-C). 9-11 UV-C is proven to reduce bacterial and viral contamination across a variety of health care settings by addressing both surface and air column disinfection, 9, 10 and this technology has been shown to reduce the incidence of both bacterial and viral health care-associated infections (HAIs). 10 Consensus however is that improved cleaning should include both surface disinfection and UV-C approaches because UV-C alone may be limited by shadowing (areas of the room that the UV-C light does not reach). 11 Similarly, surface disinfection procedures (ie, deep terminal cleaning) should also be supplemented with UV-C or equivalent technology because of human factors resulting in cleaning failure. 12 While environmental cleaning is an important infection control consideration, our evidence-based approach for perioperative COVID-19 control should leverage a comprehensive understanding of the epidemiology of transmission for our health care arena. The epidemiology of intraoperative pathogen transmission is well characterized. [6] [7] [8] The incidence of Staphylococcus aureus transmission (a common cause of surgical site infections [SSIs] ) is reported to be as high as 39% for the general perioperative arena. 13, 16 Perioperative S. aureus transmission events are tightly associated with SSI development with 50% of S. aureus SSIs linked by whole-cell genome analysis to one of more intraoperative reservoirs. 14 Similarly, isolation of one or more Klebsiella, Acinetobacter, Pseudomonas, or Enterobacter (KAPE) pathogens from one more intraoperative reservoirs are associated with increased risk of a Gram-negative HAI development. 17 Intraoperative bacterial transmission relates to nadirs in hand hygiene compliance that occur during induction and emergence of anesthesia and correlate with peaks in environmental contamination. 18 As such, single modality improvement strategies (ie, hand hygiene alone) have been associated with a trend toward increased risk of infection. 19 Hand hygiene, while an important preventive measure, should not stand alone for control of perioperative spread of COVID-19. It is insufficient.",

There are over 350 hand decontamination opportunities during routine, intraoperative patient care. 18 Perioperative care has a high task-density that threatens hand hygiene compliance, especially during induction and emergence of anesthesia. 18 These are critical periods for viral and bacterial transmission to the surrounding patient environment.

Frequency: After induction of anesthesia, wipe down all equipment and surfaces with disinfection wipes that contain a quaternary ammonium compound and alcohol. Confirm your hospital's selected wipes have antiviral activity. Quality: For improved routine and terminal cleaning, using a top-down approach, spray all surfaces and the anesthesia and circulating nurse work space-including but not limited to keyboards and mice-with a quaternary ammonium compound and wait the required time per agent utilized (typically 1-3 minutes). Then wipe with a dry microfiber cloth. This cloth should then be laundered. Wipe all surfaces and equipment again with the designated quaternary ammonium and alcohol surface disinfection wipes used above. This cleaning sequence is critical for achieving adequate bioburden reduction. UV-C: Treat at-risk rooms defined by your hospital's surveillance. These treatments are typically 20-30 minutes and can be focused on the high-risk anesthesia work area and should also include the circulating nurse desk area that is likely to be contaminated and often excluded from cleaning procedures. If UV-C is not available, use the above cleaning process for a more extensive cleaning approach to at-risk environments (enhanced terminal cleaning).

This is unlike the normal situation wherein constraints on the care of such patients are most commonly surgeons (proceduralists) and/ or rooms busy with other elective cases. 26 To complete our infection-control strategy, we relied on the online bibliography of OR management articles and recent review articles. 27-30 None of the articles considered the performance objective of reducing spread of infection. [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] Articles include the longer turnover times associated with cleaning when a patient has known infection, but reducing infections is nonetheless not the mathematical objective in these studies. 31, 32 Readers will also note that the articles cited here are primarily from the fields of mathematics and engineering, and thus will not be found in PubMed. [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] Therefore, we included the online bibliography used by specialists in OR management. 27 Fortunately, complex mathematics is not required to solve the situation where the daily number of cases is less than the number of rooms available. While there may be restrictions on some procedures in some rooms, for convenience we will consider the important conceptual construct that cases could be completed while performing 1 case in each room.",

In other words, aim for as few different people as possible working daily in the surgical suite or procedural locations. For instance, if there are 8 ORs sharing 1 master ventilatory system and 8 essential cases to be done (each lasting 1-2 hours), the ideal solution is to have 2 teams complete the 8 cases in the available rooms. This contrasts sharply with the traditional 8 first case starts in 8 rooms with 8 teams of providers! The benefit to staff and the organization with the \"infection-control\" approach is that if a patient were found to have COVID-19 after surgery, fewer personnel were exposed.",

Note that this does not mean literally that a room can be used just once a day. Rather, let anesthesia and nursing teams (and surgeons/proceduralists if they have >1 case) work in more than 1 room so that each room receives deep cleaning between cases.",

Putting a surgical mask onto each patient would result in depletion of the supply of the protective equipment, an action that is inconsistent with the second condition above. Instead, have most patients recover in the room where they had surgery. This is done routinely in Japan-with the anesthesiologist recovering their patient-because few hospitals have a phase I postanesthesia care unit. 33 When the time of patient recovery was compared between a Japanese hospital where anesthesiologist recovery was routine practice versus the University of Iowa where there is a phase I postanesthesia care unit and nurses, the longest recovery time in Japan was briefer than the shortest recovery time in the United States. 34 Clinicians should consider selecting anesthetic drugs to minimize recovery times and possibly accomplish phase 1 recovery within the OR itself. 35, 36 Consider, when appropriate, using peripheral nerve block instead of general anesthesia. 37, 38 Fourth, if the surgeon (proceduralist) will be operating later in the day and is scheduled for only 1 procedure, provide notification when there is the start of closure of the preceding case being done by the anesthesia and nursing team. 39 This communication reduces their total exposure time in the OR and should not limit workflow if the preceding patient will be recovered in the OR by the anesthesiologist or certified registered nurse anesthetist.
