A random number table was used to assign participants to intervention and control groups. The intervention group received 3 biweekly mixed media education sessions, which consisted of lectures, videos, role-playing, and feedback. Participants also received 15-20 minutes of individual online supervision and feedback sessions from researchers on their practice following each class. The control group learned about SPs through self-study. The study materials were sent via e-mail by researchers to members of the control group twice\u2014after the intervention group's first session and after the second session. They also had regular access to their clinical teachers for SPs instruction and general clinical guidance. For pretest, nursing students were invited to complete the demographic questionnaire and scales. Hand hygiene swab cultures were obtained after handwashing before nursing procedures during their work time. For posttest, after the intervention nursing students were invited to complete the scales during the break time of their clinical practice. Hand hygiene swab culture procedures were repeated for the posttest.",

The teaching hospital we chose is affiliated with among the best universities in China. It is a Grade-III Class-A facility (the largest and most comprehensive research and teaching hospitals according to the Chinese Hospital Ranking System) with a 3,300-bed hospital. Eligible participants were nursing students at the beginning of clinical training. Half of the sample (n = 42) was randomly assigned to the intervention group and another half to the control group. Previous studies of the effectiveness of mixed education programs for nursing students used a target effect size of 0.35.22, 23 G*Power 3 (http://www.gpower.hhu.de/en.html) was used to calculate the sample size.24 At a statistical power of 0.80, a sample size of 70 was necessary to assess pre\u2013post mean group differences with effect size of 0.35 and a significance level of 0.05.25 Considering a 20% dropout rate,26 a total of 84 participants was needed, with 42 in each group.

During the second session (2 hours), the researcher (PX) showed videos to demonstrate correct SPs procedures, such as how to properly wash hands, wear sterile gloves, and wear isolation gowns and personal protective equipment. The third session (2 hours) consisted of small group (6-7 participants per group) discussions focusing on the principles of SPs and their application in clinical practice. Role-playing exercises were facilitated during this session. The nursing students played the roles of teachers and students in small groups to assess and demonstrate correct SPs procedures with each other. The SPs procedures script, which included handwashing, wearing sterile gloves, wearing isolation gowns, and wearing personal protective equipment, was prepared by researchers and hospital infection management office staff members.

The Chinese validation process of the CSPS was that the original English scale was translated into Chinese by 2 bilingual translators. The Chinese translation was reviewed and revised by a study author (XW) and the translators and another 2 bilingual translators back-translated the revised Chinese translation into English. The back-translated English scale was then reviewed and finalized by another study author (JZ) and the translators. Finally, the author of the CSPS was invited to assess the quality of the Chinese translation by looking at the back-translated scale and the original. A pilot study was done with 30 nursing students (participation rate and recovery rate were both 100%).

The infection control-related chapters in fundamental nursing and surgical nursing textbooks are very limited and not fully taught,39, 40 and there are no specific courses on SPs or infection control. More than 85% of nursing students receive infection control knowledge from their clinical teachers.41 The usual practice is to follow the school curriculum, which does not explicitly teach about SPs. One survey in 2010 demonstrated that half of 1,444 nursing students did not receive any SPs education at all at school.12 Most nursing students receive partial SPs knowledge when they start their clinical practice, either taught by their clinical instruction teachers or learned from other sources.",
