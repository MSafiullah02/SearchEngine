Demographic and clinical data were collected from electronic medical hospital records. ICU transfer was the primary outcome. Categorical variables were analysed by chisquared or Fisher's exact test and continuous variables by the Kruskal-Wallis test. Poisson regression model was used for regression analysis. Cases were followedup from the first day of hospitalisation to ICU transfer or hospital discharge or death. Cases still hospitalised were censored on 3 April. Data collection was approved by the local Ethics Committee (17104_oss).

However, in our preliminary analysis, we observed a 12% reduction in ICU transfer rate adjusted for comorbidities between the pre-and post-intervention period (p = 0.002). This benefit is represented by avoiding endotracheal intubation, taking out possible infectious risks. However, endotracheal intubation should not be delayed in patients with haemodynamic instability, multiorgan failure, or abnormal mental status [8] . Unfortunately, we could not now evaluate if the intervention had an impact also on mortality, because 19 (22.6%) patients were still hospitalised, and mortality rate could have been underestimated in N-ICU. Current evidence against corticosteroid application in COVID-19 is unclear, but the Chinese Thoracic Society recently developed an expert consensus statement on the use of corticosteroids SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia [9] . The increase in corticosteroid prescriptions in the postintervention period could have played a role in reducing ICU transmission rate. Because of the small sample size and limited outcome information, we could not run a solid multivariable analysis and these results should be cautiously interpreted.",
