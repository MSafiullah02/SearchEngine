Therefore, the critical operational decision involves which system to choose to meet patient care needs while integrating smoothly into a laboratory's infrastructure.

Recently, Idaho Technology received FDA approval for 5 additional respiratory viral and bacterial agents including coronavirus 229E, coronavirus OC43, Bordetella pertussis, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. It is simple and fully automated (sample in, result out), with a 65-minute TAT and a single-piece throughput platform. We implemented FilmArray in our core laboratory and ran the test 24/7 during this respiratory viral season. We started with 2 FilmArray instruments. As the volume of tests increased, a third instrument was added and then a fourth one was made available to us as a backup.

In addition, the FilmArray respiratory viral panel includes more viral agents that were not included in previous testing using DFA.

Because of its rapid TAT, FilmArray testing for respiratory viruses was also used to place patients into cohorts effectively. In fact, 20% of the respiratory viral tests we performed were primarily for the purpose of patient isolation and forming cohorts. In 2 cases in which patients were admitted for urgent surgery, the rapid respiratory viral testing quickly ruled out influenza infection so that the surgery did not have to be performed under strict isolation procedures using masks and negative pressure in the operating room.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "The purchase price of a FilmArray respiratory viral PCR panel was $109 per reagent pouch after discount (list price, $129). Adding 1% to 2% of pouch failure rate and additional quality control testing, the cost was approximately $115 per test. The test took approximately 5 minutes to perform, which was about the same amount of time required for packaging a sample to be sent to a reference laboratory. We did not add any FTE in the core laboratory with the addition of the test. The cost of sending a sample to the reference laboratory for respiratory viral testing by DFA was $98.26. The actual price of FilmArray was only slightly higher than that previous spent on respiratory viral testing. For the DFA testing performed in previous years, nasal wash was the preferred specimen type. The collection of a nasal wash sample resulted in the generation of aerosols, and therefore procedure rooms had to be closed for 30 minutes before the rooms could be used again. Replacing the nasal wash with a midturbinate swab increased efficiency by eliminating the 30-minute room closures. Because 71% of the respiratory viral testing samples were collected from the ED, we potentially saved 900 hours of ED room for the 2,537 respiratory viral tests performed. The cost savings could not be accurately calculated. However, in 1 report it was found that a 1-hour reduction in ED boarding time would result in $9,693 to $13,298 of additional daily revenue. 18 In this report the calculation included patients who left without being seen, which represented 7% of all ED visits.

Furthermore, we were unable to quantify viral load, which may also be important in some patients. In addition, the high detection rate of rhinovirus cannot be necessarily interpreted as high rates of acute rhinovirus infection because prolonged rates of rhinovirus shedding have been reported. Finally, because there is no interface with our computerized data entry system currently, we required 2 technologists to verify the reported results for clerical error reduction.
