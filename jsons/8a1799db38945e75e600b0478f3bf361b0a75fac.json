Five of these patients had hypoprothrombinemia and 4 had increased serum creatinine levels, indicating hepatic and/or renal dysfunction. Fourteen patients experienced postinfluenzal encephalopathy \u04403 weeks after resolution of acute respiratory symptoms. In 6 patients, focal areas of high signal intensity were visible on T2-weighted magnetic resonance images of the brain. Adenovirus DNA was detected in CSF specimens obtained from 4 (36%) of 11 patients with postinfluenzal encephalopathy. Thus, influenzal encephalopathy is frequently associated with metabolic disorders, whereas postinfluenzal encephalopathy appears to have different possible etiologies.",

For almost a century, there has been debate about a causal link between severe neurological disease and influenza virus infection. After the development of laboratory diagnostic assays, it became apparent that only very few of the patients with acute encephalopathy or encephalitis associated with an influenza-like illness were actually infected with influenza virus [2, 3] . Consequently, most of the current knowledge about influenza-associated neurological disorders was derived from reports of a small number of welldocumented cases (reviewed in [4] ). An outbreak of influenza-associated encephalopathy in Japan was reported recently [5] , but clinical presentation in this large cohort was distinct from that observed previously in patients with influenza-associated encephalopathy.",

            "text": "Attempts to demonstrate the presence of the virus in the CSF or brains of patients suspected of having influenza virus encephalitis have only been successful on rare occasions in the past [6, 7] . Recently, detection rates of influenza viruses in CSF samples have increased with the application of highly sensitive, influenza virus-specific PCR assays [5, 8] . It is unclear, however, whether the use of PCR assays for routine CSF diagnostics may further increase the frequency of influenza virus detection in the CSF and how influenza virus-positive PCR results should be interpreted. This is especially important in light of frequent detection of other viral pathogens in CSF samples obtained from patients with influenza-associated encephalopathy [9, 10] . The aim of this study was to gain insight into influenza-associated acute encephalopathy by evaluating virological, clinical, laboratory, and neuroradiographic features in a well-defined cohort of patients. 1998-1999, 1999-2000, and 2000-2001, influenza A virus infection was diagnosed in 571 hospitalized patients by serological testing (407 patients; defined by a \u04434fold increase in the titer or a titer of 164 determined with use of a complement fixation [CF] test) or by virus detection (164 patients; determined by virus isolation, antigen ELISA, or both). These periods of epidemic influenza activity lasted 7-10 weeks, and the predominant circulating influenza strains were A/H1N1 and A/H3N2.",

Accordingly, influenza virus could rarely be detected in CSF samples obtained from patients who had influenza-associated encephalopathy or encephalitis in the past [4, 5, 19] . It cannot be entirely discounted that, in the present cases, lumbar puncture was performed too late for the detection of influenza A virus in the CSF.

These findings are in concordance with previous studies of influenza-associated encephalopathy that found liver function abnormalities [5, 8, 20, 23] .

Divergent CSF WBC values, presence of viruses other than influenza virus in the CSF, and diverse MRI findings suggest that the clinical diagnosis of postinfluenzal encephalopathy, established by the close timing between acute respiratory tract illness and onset of acute neurological symptoms, has a number of different possible etiologies.",
