            "text": "Plant virus replication involves interactions with cell compartments and components, and thus it is important to have an understanding of the basic structures involved. The basic structure of a plant cell is shown in Box 7.1\n. All these main regions of the cell are involved in viral replication, but the actual details vary between different virus groups as will be described in this chapter.Box 7.1Structure of the Plant CellThe basic features of the plant cell that are involved in virus infection are shown schematically in Figure 7.1\n.CytoplasmThe cytoplasm is the entire content of the cell excluding the nucleus. It comprises the cytosol which is a complex mixture of ions (e.g., sodium, potassium, calcium) and macromolecules (e.g., proteins) in a water environment, together with organelles such as chloroplasts and the Golgi apparatus, and is where much of the cellular metabolism occurs. There are multiple levels of organization in the cytosol, including concentration gradients of ions like calcium and macromolecules like enzymes. Crowding of macromolecules in the cytosol can alter the properties, proteins and nucleic acids.NucleusThe nucleus is a highly dynamic organelle surrounded by a double membrane which has numerous nuclear pores enabling communication with the surrounding cytosol. These pores allow free movement of small molecules and ions, but the movement of larger molecules like proteins is carefully controlled, requiring active transport regulated by carrier proteins. The nucleus contains most of the cell\u2019s genetic material, organized as multiple long linear DNA molecules in complex with a large variety of proteins, such as histones, to form chromosomes. It is the site of major cellular events, including DNA replication, messenger RNA synthesis and processing, and ribosome subunit biogenesis. The structure of the nucleus is maintained by the nuclear lamina, a meshwork analogous to the cytoskeleton.Within the nucleus is the nucleolus, which is a nonmembrane-bound compartment composed of proteins and nucleic acids. It is the site of rDNA transcription, rRNA processing, and ribosome assembly and is implicated in many other aspects of cell function, such as cell cycle regulation, gene silencing, telomerase activity, senescence, stress responses, and biogenesis of multiple ribonucleoprotein (RNP) particles. Details of nucleolar structure and function are reviewed by Taliansky et al. (2010).ChloroplastA typical parenchyma cell contains about 10\u2013100 chloroplasts which are organelles about 2\u201310 \u03bcm in diameter and 2.3 \u03bcm thick. They comprise a outer double membrane enveloping the stroma (analogous to the cytosol) and contain one or more molecules of circular DNA and ribosomes; however, most of its proteins are encoded by genes contained in the host cell nucleus, with the protein products being transported to the chloroplast. Within the stroma are thylacoids which are stacks of membrane structures termed grana and which are the site of photosynthesis.MitochondriaMitochondria are organelles about 0.5\u201310 \u03bcm in diameter enclosed in a double membrane and provide the energy for cellular functions like cell division. They are also involved in other functions, such as signaling, cellular differentiation, and cell death, as well as the control of the cell cycle and cell growth.Golgi Apparatus and Other OrganellesThe Golgi apparatus is a membrane-bound structure bounded by a single membrane. It is actually a stack of membrane-bound vesicles (cysternae) that are important in packaging macromolecules for transport elsewhere in the cell. The stack of larger vesicles is surrounded by numerous smaller vesicles containing those packaged macromolecules. The Golgi apparatus is integral in modifying, sorting, and packaging these macromolecules for cell secretion (exocytosis) or use within the cell. It primarily modifies proteins delivered from the rough ER but is also involved in the transport of lipids around the cell.Peroxisomes are organelles on the periphery of the Golgi apparatus and are responsible for protecting the cell from its own production of hydrogen peroxide by oxidative enzymes to break down the hydrogen peroxide into water and oxygen.The vacuole is a membrane-bound organelle which is essentially an enclosed compartment which is filled with water containing inorganic and organic molecules including enzymes in solution, though in certain cases it may contain solids which have been engulfed. Its functions include: isolating materials that might be harmful or a threat to the cell; containing waste products; maintaining an acidic internal pH; and exporting unwanted substances from the cell.Membranes and Cytoskeletal SystemPlant (and other) cells have an extensive membrane and cytoskeletal systems that play major roles in virus replication and other functions. There are many interactions between the various elements.Endoplasmic Reticulum (reviewed by Hu et al., 2011, Sparkes et al., 2009, Staehelin, 1997)The ER forms a large interconnected network of tubules, vesicles, and cisternae within cells and is a continuation of the ONM. There are three forms of ER, rough ER which synthesizes proteins (the rough appearance being due to the presence of ribosomes) and smooth ER which synthesizes lipids and steroids, metabolizes carbohydrates and steroids, and regulates calcium concentration and attachment of receptors on cell membrane proteins. Calcium levels are also regulated in the sarcoplasmic reticulum.CytoskeletonThe cytoskeleton is an organized network of three types of protein filaments: microtubules, actin filaments, and intermediate fibers, and provides the cell with structure, shape, compartmentalization, and movement of macromolecules. Cytoskeletal elements interact extensively and intimately with cellular membranes.Microtubules (reviewed by Hamada, 2007, Wasteneys, 2002) are hollow cylinders about 23 nm in diameter (lumen is approximately 15 nm in diameter), most commonly comprising 13 protofilaments which, in turn, are polymers of \u03b1- and \u03b2-tubulin.Actin filaments (reviewed by Higaki et al., 2007, \u0160lajcherov\u00e1 et al., 2012, Sparkes, 2011, Staiger and Blanchoin, 2006) are composed of linear polymers of actin subunits, and generate force by elongation at one end of the filament coupled with shrinkage at the other, causing net movement of the intervening strand. They also act as tracks for the movement of some organelles and macromolecules that attach to the microfilament and \u201cwalk\u201d along them. Myosins are the motor proteins for organelle and macromolecule movement along actin fibers and comprise an N-terminal motor head domain responsible for actin binding and a C-terminal domain implicated in cargo binding. Plant myosins are classified into two groups: class XI and class VIII (reviewed by Sparkes, 2011); different myosin \u201cspecies\u201d carry different cargos.There are considerable interactions between actin and microtubules (reviewed by Petr\u00e1sek and Schwartzerov\u00e1, 2009).Although little work has been done on intermediate filaments in plants, there is some evidence that cytosolic intermediate filaments might be present, and plant nuclear filaments have been detected. Like actin filaments, they function in the maintenance of cell shape by bearing tension which, in contrast to microtubules, resists compression. Intermediate filaments organize the internal tridimensional structure of the cell, anchoring organelles.",

Brachypodium has a small genome (~300 Mbp), diploid, tetraploid, and hexaploid accession, a small physical stature, self fertility, a short life cycle, and simple growth requirements. Its genome has recently been sequenced (The International Brachypodium Initiative, 2010). With the rapid accumulation of knowledge, this species could be useful for studies on viruses infecting graminaceous species though it has not yet been included in host range studies of many such viruses.

            "text": "Inoculated leaves have several advantages. Events can be timed more precisely from the time of inoculation than can those from systemic infections. A fairly uniform set of leaves from different plants can be selected, and half-leaves may be used as control material. There are three major disadvantages:i.A typical leaf such as a tobacco leaf with a surface area of 200 cm2, for example, contains about 3\u00d7107 cells. The upper limit for the proportion of epidermal cells that can be infected by mechanical inoculation under the best conditions is not known precisely, but is probably not more than about 104 cells per leaf. Thus, at the beginning of an experiment, only about 1 in 103 of the cells in the system has been infected. Even for those that are directly infected, the synchrony of infection may not be very sharp, especially if whole virus is used as inoculum. Thus, early replication events in the small proportion of infected cells will probably be diluted out beyond detection by the relatively enormous number of as-yet-uninfected cells. Then, as infection progresses, a mixed population of cells at different stages of infection will be produced.ii.The second major disadvantage of inoculated leaf tissue, at least for studying events over the first few hours, is that mechanical inoculation itself is a severe shock to the leaf, causing changes in respiration, water content, and probably many other things as well, including nucleic acid synthesis. Thus, the use of appropriately treated control leaves is essential.iii.A third difficulty applies to experiments in which radioactively labeled virus is used as inoculum. Most of the virus applied to the leaf does not infect cells, and a substantial but variable proportion cannot be washed off after inoculation. The fate of the infecting particles may well be masked by the mass of potentially infective inoculum remaining on or in the leaf.\n",

The lower inoculated leaves of an intact plant are maintained at normal temperatures (c. 25\u221230\u00b0C) while the upper leaves are kept at 5\u221212\u00b0C. Under these conditions, systemic infection of the young leaves occurs, but replication does not. When the upper leaves are shifted to a higher temperature, replication begins in a fairly synchronous fashion (Dawson et al., 1975). This procedure provides a very useful system that complements, in several respects, the study of virus replication in protoplasts, discussed below. The technique uses intact plants, is simple, and can provide substantial amounts of material. The main requirement is for a systemic host with a habit of growth that makes it possible for upper and lower leaves to be kept at different temperatures. Its use has been extended to some other viruses, for example, CMV in tobacco (Roberts and Wood, 1981).",

The physiological state of the leaves from which disks are taken affects uptake and metabolism of radioactively labeled materials (Kummert and Semal, 1969). There may be two serious disadvantages: (i) microorganisms grow on the surface of the disks and in the intercellular spaces, so addition of antibiotics may not block all microorganisms and may well alter the biochemical situation in the cells of interest, and (ii) excised disks are not uniform in several ways (Pratt and Matthews, 1971). First, there is a \u201cgeographical\u201d gradient from the cut edge to the center of the piece of tissue. Differences involve the uptake of labeled precursors and their utilization for nucleic acid synthesis. Second, excised tissues change with time in a complex fashion in their ability to accumulate substances from the medium. There may be a differential accumulation of labeled precursors in the cut ends of veins. Third, further variables are introduced when the excised tissue is treated with a drug like actinomycin D, which may be distributed very unevenly in the tissue.",

Defined plant growth conditions may improve the quality and reproducibility of the isolated preparations (Kubo et al., 1975); (ii) under culture conditions that favor virus replication, protoplasts survive only for 2\u22123 days and then decline and die; (iii) to prevent growth of microorganisms during incubation, antibiotics may be added to the medium. These may have unexpected effects on virus replication (e.g., gentamycin, Kassanis et al., 1975); (iv) compared to intact tissue, relatively small quantities of cells are made available; (v) cytological effects observed in thin sections of infected leaf tissue may not be reproduced in protoplasts\u2014probably because of the effects of changed osmotic conditions on cell membranes, for example, with TMV in tobacco (Otsuki et al., 1972a), TYMV in Chinese cabbage (Sugimura and Matthews, 1981), FLSV in cowpea (van Beek et al., 1985), and CaMV in turnip (Yamaoka et al., 1982); (vi) the isolation procedure and the medium in which they are maintained must drastically affect the physiological state of the cells. Physical and chemical disturbances include partial dehydration, severing of plasmodesmata, loss of the cell wall compartment which is not metabolically inert, reversal of the cell\u2019s electrical potential, inhibition of leucine uptake, a large increase in RNase activity, and cellulose synthesis and wall regeneration, which begin very soon after the protoplasts are isolated.

For example, Renaudin et al.

These estimates were based on the assumption that all the cells in the leaf were infected, and that they were of the same size. If, however, the estimates are made on the same class of cell as used for the in vitro studies (i.e., palisade mesophyll), and if only infected cells are considered, then yields per cell in the intact leaf are about 10 times higher (Sugimura and Matthews, 1981).

However, inoculating RNA can be very inefficient due to RNases and so, if a suitable promoter is included, the cDNA construct can be inoculated to express the viral RNA and initiate infection. Inoculations can either be direct or using Agrobacterium tumefaciens to introduce the viral nucleic acid into the host (Grimsley et al., 1986). This latter process, termed \u201cagroinfection\u201d or \u201cagro- inoculation,\u201d (Chapter 4, Section IV, B, 2) is useful when the virus, e.g., a geminivirus or luteovirus, requires an insect (or other) vector for inoculation (Boulton et al., 1989, Leisner et al., 1992). Another situation requiring agroinfection is for members of the Caulimoviridae, the genomes of which are transcribed from more-than-genome length constructs (termed \u201cone-and-a-bitmers\u201d) (Grimsley et al., 1986, Dasgupta et al., 1991; Section VII). Although A. tumefaciens naturally infects only dicotyledonous plants, agroinfection is equally successful with monocotyledonous species. However, there is some species and strain specificity of Agrobacterium for successful inoculations (Marks et al., 1989).",

There are substantial difficulties and limitations in the effective use of tracer compounds for studying the replication of plant viruses. Various ways have been used to introduce the labeled material into the tissue being studied. Whole plants can be removed from their pots, the roots carefully washed free of soil, and the isotope applied to the roots. This procedure is useful for 32P-labeled orthophosphate and 35S-labeled sulfate. Provided there is no delay in applying the isotope after washing the roots, uptake is rapid and efficient. With plants like actively growing Chinese cabbage, 32P may be detected in leaves within minutes of application, and uptake into the plant may be more or less complete within a few hours. With these two isotopes, uptake into leaves through the roots is much more effective than floating intact disks of leaf tissue on solutions of the isotope, even if the disks are sliced to expose more vein ends. Placing leaves with their cut petioles in the solution can lead to a highly variable and irregular uptake of isotope. However, by careful timing and attention to growth conditions, quite high specific activities can be obtained [e.g., 1 mCi 32P (3.7\u00d7107\n Bq)/mg viral RNA; Bastin and Kaesberg, 1975]. Kopp et al. (1981) describe a procedure in which pieces of leaf from which the lower epidermis has been stripped are floated on a solution containing the radioactive precursor. No systematic study of the best ways to introduce such precursors as amino acids and nucleotides appears to have been made. Devices are available for injecting solutions into leaves (Hagborg, 1970, Konat\u00e9 and Fritig, 1983).",

By various manipulations, it is possible to reduce or raise the overall concentration of phosphorus compounds not more than two- to threefold. Thus, in leaf tissue it has not been possible to carry out effective pulse-chase type experiments with phosphorus. With most organic compounds that can be used as labeled virus precursors, active leaves are continually providing an endogenous source of supply. Furthermore, plant tissues have the capacity to metabolize carbon compounds in many different ways, so that the labeled atom may soon appear in a wide range of low-molecular-weight compounds. For certain kinds of experiments, it is useful to be able to label purified virus chemically in vitro to high specific activity. A variety of procedures are available (Montelaro and Rueckert, 1975, Frost, 1977).",

            "text": "Details of RdRps are given in Box 7.2\n.\nBox 7.2Some Properties of Viral RdRpsEight motifs have been recognized in the amino acid sequences of RdRps (Kamer and Argos, 1984; Koonin, 1991, Koonin and Dolja, 1993, Poch et al., 1989). The most conserved of these is a Gly\u2013Asp\u2013Asp (GDD) motif which is flanked by segments of mainly hydrophobic amino acids and is involved with the binding of Mg2+ which is essential for enzyme activity. Details of these motifs have led to RdRps being classified into three superfamily:Supergroup I is sometimes called the \u201cpicornavirus (-like)\u201d supergroup;Supergroup II the \u201ccarmovirus (-like)\u201d supergroup;Supergroup III the \u201calphavirus (-like)\u201d supergroup.\nSupergroup I members are characterized by usually having one genome segment that has a 5\u2032 VPg and expresses its genetic information as a polyprotein. Members of supergroups II and III have one to several genome segments, the RNA is often capped and individual genes are translated.The supergroups extend across viruses that infect vertebrates, plants, and bacteria and there are representatives of plant viruses in each supergroup (Table 7.1). The members of each group have several properties in common.The three-dimensional structure of the RdRp of several viruses has been determined by X-ray crystallography (Hansen et al., 1997, van Dijk et al., 2004) (Figure 7.5A\n).The overall structure of the enzyme is similar to those of other polymerases [DNA-dependent DNA polymerase, DNA-dependent RNA polymerase, and reverse transcriptase (RT) (Figure 7.5B)] that have been likened to a right hand. The palm domain contains the catalytic core and is similar to that of the other three polymerases. The thumb and finger domains differ from those of the other polymerases. Using the neural net PHD (for Predict at Heidelberg) computer method (Rost et al., 1994), O\u2019Reilly and Kao (1998) predicted the secondary structure of the RdRps of BMV, TBSV, and TMV and compared the predictions with the poliovirus RdRp structure. This analysis indicated that the RdRps of these supergroup 2 and 3 viruses have a similar structure to the supergroup 1 poliovirus enzyme, each containing a region unique to RdRps.The palm domain contains five of the amino acid sequence motifs (A\u2013E), which have the following functions:A.coordination of one of the two Mg2+ ions required for function; possibly selection of ribose over deoxyribose;B.possibly selection of ribose over deoxyribose;C.coordination of the other Mg2+ ion;D.completion of the palm core structure;E.hydrophobic interaction with the thumb.\nThe RdRp unique region is thought to be involved in the interaction with the thumb of a neighboring polymerase.\nFigure 7.5C shows models for initiation and elongation of RNA synthesis by RdRp.",

            "text": "As was initially shown by Bol et al. (1971), inoculation with the three AMV RNA species does not give infection unless either viral CP or the sg mRNA (RNA4) for CP is present (Box 7.3\n). The ilarviruses also have a requirement for CP to initiate infection and functional equivalence has been shown between their CP and that of AMV by the activation of the AMV genome by TSV coat protein (CP) and vice versa (van Vloten-Doting, 1975).Box 7.3Alfalfa Mosaic Virus CP Involvement in Translation and Replication (reviewed by Bol, 2005)The genome organization of AMV (and closely related Ilarviruses) is similar to that of BMV (Appendix A, Profile 51), but there is an involvement of CP, either from the virus particle or expressed from sgRNA4 for replication in a process called genome activation. One to three CP dimers bind through their N-terminal amino acids (Jaspars and Houwing, 2002) to a specific site near the 3\u2032 terminus of RNAs 1\u20133. There is a homologous sequence at the 3\u2032 termini of the three genomic RNAs which can assume two mutually exclusive conformers (Olsthoorn et al., 1999) (Figure 7.8\n).In the CP-binding conformation (CBP) the 3\u2032 112 nt of the UTRs of RNAs 1\u20133 and of the sgRNA4 form a linear array of five stem loops (A\u2013E) separated by the sequence AUGC (Figure 7.8A). The CP dimers bind to stem loops A and B (Ansel-McKinney and Gehrke, 1998; Figure 7.8C). Efficient translation of AMV RNAs requires this CP binding (Neeleman et al., 2001, Neeleman et al., 2004). The CP interacts with wheat germ eIF4G and eIFiso4G components of the initiation factor complexes eIF4F and eIFiso4F (Krab et al., 2005). Extension of the AMV RNAs with a poly(A) tail circumvents the requirement for CP to initiate infection suggesting that in a wild-type infection, CP mimics the function of PABP (Neeleman et al., 2001).In the alternative conformation (TL), the 3\u2032UTRs of RNAs 1\u20133 assume a pseudoknotted structure through base pairing between the D and A loops; this resembles the bromovirus TLS (Olsthoorn and Bol, 2002; Figure 7.8B); unlike bromoviruses, this TLS does not charge with amino acids. The crystal structure of an AMV RNA\u2013peptide complex shows that the conserved AUGC repeats co-fold with Pro\u2013Thr\u2013x\u2013Ser\u2013x\u2013x\u2013Tyr CP amino acids giving the TLS (Guogas et al., 2004). The TLS conformation is required for (\u2212)-strand synthesis and in vitro studies suggest that hairpin E binds the viral polymerase (Olsthoorn et al., 2004).Thus, switching between translation and replication is controlled by changes in conformation involving the CP (Olsthoorn et al., 1999). The CP binding appears to have two roles, first in very early stages of virus replication most probably in translation and later in infection in shutting off (\u2212)-strand RNA synthesis. The detailed molecular mechanism of this switch is not yet understood but at some stage could involve expression of the viral replicase. CP enhances the in vitro binding of RNA by the replicase proteins suggesting that the CP formed a bridge that gave accurate de novo initiation (Reichert et al., 2007). However, it is uncertain as to whether CP is involved in vivo.",

Other tobamoviruses may have longer 3\u2032 UTRs and more pseudoknots (Gultyaev et al., 1994, Shivprasad et al., 1999, Bodaghi et al., 2000). Regions important for (\u2212)-strand synthesis of TMV are the acceptor and anticodon arms of the TLS, the region with the three pseudoknots, and the central core sequence connecting these elements (Osman et al., 2000). Mutational analysis of the 3\u2032-terminal four nucleotides of the TLS indicated the importance of the 3\u2032-terminal CA sequence for (\u2212)-strand synthesis, with the sequence CCCA or GGCA giving the highest transcriptional efficiency. Several double-helical regions, but not their sequences, which are essential for forming pseudoknots and/or stem-loop structures in the TLS and pseudoknot regions are required for high template efficiency (Osman et al., 2000).",

Mutations in the p126 sequence showed that tyrosine residues 409 and 416 are essential for the cross-linking and for the ability of the virus to replicate in protoplasts. It is suggested that the synthesis of TMV (\u2212) strand is initiated by the binding of the TLS and core sequence to the internal sequence in p126 followed by binding of p183 to this complex, thus positioning the catalytic active site of the polymerase domain close to the 3\u2032-terminal CCCA initiation site (Osman and Buck, 2003).",

            "text": "Other structures in the 3\u2032 UTR, often forming pseudoknots, can be important in the initiation of (\u2212)-strand synthesis as well as controlling transcription. For instance, the 3\u2032-terminal part of the TBSV genome contains four RNA elements important for replication (Fabian et al., 2003, Na et al., 2006) which, together with the 3\u2032 UTR sequences of carmoviruses, are described in detail in Box 6.6. The complex interactions in the replication of the two RNAs of RCNMV are described in Box 7.4\n.Box 7.4Replication of Red Clover Necrotic Mosaic VirusThe genome of RCNMV is divided into two RNAs, RNA1 and RNA2. RNA1 encodes a 27-kDa protein which frameshifts an overlapping to give p88; these two proteins are required for the replication of RNA1 and RNA2 and form a 480-kDa complex (Mine et al., 2010). RNA1 also encodes the CP which is expressed from a sgRNA (CP sg mRNA). RNA2 encodes the MP.RNAs 1 and 2 share little homology except for the 5\u2032 first 6 nts and two stem-loop structures located at the 3\u2032 ends of both RNAs. The RNA replication mechanisms differ between RNA1 and RNA2 (Iwakawa et al., 2011).The 3\u2032 UTR of RCNMV RNA1 contains sequences for both initiation of (\u2212)-strand synthesis and cap-independent translational enhancement (the 3\u2032 TE-DRI, see Chapter 6, Section V, E). These two cis-acting RNA elements are separated and act independently (Iwakawa et al., 2007) (Figure 7.9A\n).The 3\u2032 terminal stem-loop structure of RNA1 comprising SLF, SLDE, and SeqB is considered to be the core promoter for (\u2212)-strand synthesis (Weng and Xiong, 2009) and SLDb and SLDc probably act as enhancers (Iawakawa et al., 2007). RNA1 replicates preferentially with p88 translated from its own molecule in the presence of p27, whereas RNA2 replicates effectively with p88 supplied in trans together with p27, presumably as the 480-kDa complex (Okamoto et al., 2008). Thus, essentially it is co-translational replication.RNA2 requires RNA1 for its replication but, as noted above, replicates by a different mechanism with p88 and p27 supplied in trans. The cap-independent translational activity of RNA2 is strongly linked to RNA replication (Mizumoto et al., 2006). Therefore, RNA elements essential for RNA2 replication are also essential to enhance the cap-independent translation of RNA2. RNA2 has cis-acting elements that interact with the replication proteins which have been mapped to the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 UTRs (Takeda et al., 2005, Turner and Buck, 1999) and to the MP ORF (Tatsuta et al., 2005). A terminal stem-loop (SL) structure and another 3\u2032 proximal SL are well conserved between RNA1 and RNA2 and among dianthoviruses and are essential for synthesis of (\u2212) strand of both RNAs (Figure 7.9A and B; Iwakawa et al., 2007). Nucleotide sequences in the other region of 3\u2032 UTR differ between RNA1 and RNA2 (An et al., 2010). Such regions are also important for synthesis of (\u2212)-strand RNA1 (Iwakawa et al., 2007) and especially a Y-shaped structure of SL7 and SL8 which interacts with p27 (Figure 7.9B) for the synthesis of (\u2212)-strand RNA2 (Turner and Buck, 1999, An et al., 2010); it is suggested that the interaction with p27 functions as a binding site for replication proteins possibly recruiting RNA2 to the membrane-bound replication complex (An et al., 2010).RNA2 also contains 5\u2032 sequences and an internal sequence in the MP ORF that are essential for replication (Turner and Buck, 1999, Sit et al., 1998). The internal sequence in the MP is a transactivator (TA) consisting of a 34 nt stem-loop structure (SL2) with an eight-nucleotide loop. The loop of the TA is complementary to and binds to an 8-nt sequence, the transactivator binding sequence (TABS), immediately upstream of the CPsgRNA promoter in RNA1 (Sit et al., 1998). This trans bimolecular RNA\u2013RNA interaction is essential for transcription of the sg mRNA (Sit et al., 1998) and involves structural changes to the SL2 hairpin (Guenther et al., 2004). The same stem-loop structure (SL2) is also essential for the replication of RNA2 (Tatsuta et al., 2005) but the replication is not associated with the RNA\u2013RNA interaction with the TABS in RNA1. As well as the stem-loop structure itself, the nucleotide sequence of both the stem and loop are important for this function. The TA also is the origin of assembly of RCNMV virions (Basnayake et al., 2008). It is suggested that the base pairing between the RNA2 TA and the RNA1 TABS initiates co-packaging of the two RNAs. Thus, the TA sequence has at least four functions: (i) it is a cis-acting element for RNA2 replication; (ii) it is a trans-acting element for the transcription of sg mRNA on RNA1 and hence the expression of the CP; (iii) it is the origin of assembly of RCNMV virions, and (iv) it is part of the coding sequence for the MP.Thus there are close and integrated interactions between the two RCNMV RNA involved in both their replication and expression. Figure 7.9C shows a model for the early replication events (Iwakawa et al., 2011).",

The 5\u2032 UTRs of the gRNAs presumably act as cis-elements that regulate differences in translation and the relative rates of synthesis of each of the (+)-strand gRNAs. The 5\u2032 UTRs of the PSLV and LRSV \u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03b3 gRNAs also have little direct sequence similarity, but similar regions of folding are evident when the individual gRNAs of each virus are compared (Solovyev et al., 1996, Savenkov et al., 1998). Sequence comparisons show that the BSMV and PSLV 5\u2032 UTRs are more closely related than those of LRSV (Savenkov et al., 1998).

The RNA3 replication enhancer contains a box B motif that is conserved with the TCC loop of tRNAs and is essential for RNA3 replication (Sullivan and Ahlquist, 1999). The importance of this region was further demonstrated by showing that depurination inhibited viral replication and that the region controlled (\u2212)-strand RNA synthesis (Karran and Hudak, 2008). As well as the box B consensus sequence, bromovirus RNA3s have an oligo (A) tract (in the (+) strand) in this intercistronic regions.

In a further analysis of this using the sensitivity of the non-templated complex to heparin, Sun and Kao (1997b) determined three\nsteps with two transitions in the stability of the RNA synthesis complex (Figure 7.16\n). They suggest that the replication proteins first bind to the 3\u2032 TLS, and, after synthesis of nascent RNA, the complex undergoes a transition to a more stable structure.

Two of the deletions were large (1180 and 3000 nucleotides) while the others were much smaller. Co-inoculation of the small RNA with parent virus depressed virus synthesis in whole plants and attenuated disease symptoms.

            "text": "Most of the membrane replication sites involve the ER (Table 7.3). For several viruses, e.g., tobamoviruses, comoviruses, and nepoviruses, the cytoplasmic ER appears to be the only membrane involved, but, for some, membranes associated with other organelles are also implicated; Figure 7.1 shows that many of the membrane systems are inter-connected. Cucumoviruses and alfamoviruses (Ibrahim et al., 2012) modify the tonoplast membrane, tobraviruses and carmoviruses, the mitochondrial outer membrane (Harrison and Roberts, 1968) and tymoviruses and hordeiviruses, the outer chloroplast membrane; BNYVV particles localize to the mitochondria early in infection but later are found in the cytoplasm (Erhardt et al., 2001). Other viruses appear to modify more than one membrane. Bromoviruses and dianthoviruses are associated with the perinuclear ER and also the outer nuclear membrane (ONM) which is contiguous with the ER. TBSV forms multivesicular bodies derived from peroxisomes in a variety of plant species (reviewed by Martelli et al., 1988 and for vertebrate viruses, Lazarow, 2011). However, TBSV replicates as efficiently in yeast which had a single deletion in peroxisome biogenesis (pex) genes as in wt yeast (Panavas et al., 2005). Using confocal microscopy on yeast cells missing either PEX3 or PEX19 genes which are absolutely essential for peroxisome biogenesis, Jonczyk et al. (2007) showed that the site of TBSV replication switched to the ER. This supports the strong links between peroxisomes and ER with peroxisomes being generated from domains in the ER (Hoepfner et al., 2005) and suggests that TBSV can exploit one or more common feature between the two membranes but for some reason prefers peroxisomes. Wei et al. (2010) found that PPV replication-associated proteins initially associated with the ER but then moved predominantly to the Golgi apparatus and then, via actin microfilaments, to the periphery of chloroplasts where they docked on the outer chloroplast envelope and induced chloroplast invaginations. The chloroplast-associated vesicles contained viral replicase components and dsRNA and were concentrated with viral RNA. They suggested that plant potyviruses sequentially recruit the ER and chloroplasts for their genome replication.",

These interactions of RHPs with BMV proteins are thought to shape the vesicular structures in the ER in which the viral replication complexes function.\n",

As noted in Chapter 6, Section III, uncoating of the input virus is closely linked to, and in several cases facilitated by, initial translation of the virus genome. Translation is in a 5\u2032\u20133\u2032 direction and replication from 3\u2032 to 5\u2032 direction on the same RNA template; thus, there has to be a switch from translation to replication to prevent the polymerase colliding with the ribosomes. Mechanisms for controlling and coordinating this switch are noted above and in Chapter 16. The coordination of assembly and the composition of the replication complexes are controlled not only by the interactions between the component proteins (and nucleic acids) but also by the way that they are expressed. Thus, in some cases, some of the component proteins are expressed from frameshift or readthrough, and in other cases, they are expressed from a polyprotein processed in a defined manner. Some aspects are not yet fully understood, such as why frameshift and readthrough occur in only about 5\u221210% of the times that the ribosome reaches the site of this feature yet the products (at least of TMV) are assembled in a 1:1 ratio in the replication complex. It seems likely that (\u2212)-strand and (+)-strand syntheses are highly coordinated and that once the (+)-strand input template has been \u201ccaptured\u201d by the in vivo replication complex, the full round of RNA replication will occur. Furthermore, much more (+)-strand RNA is synthesized than (\u2212)-strand RNA. The lack of (+)-strand synthesis in most in vitro replication systems indicates either that an important factor is lost during extraction or that there are conformational constraints imposed by the location of the complex in vivo.",

With some viruses of this group, structures resembling the inner nucleoprotein cores have been seen within the nucleus (see Box 7.1 for details of the nucleus). The envelopes of some particles in the perinuclear space can be seen to be continuous with the inner lamella of the nuclear membrane. Figure 7.19\nillustrates this group.Immunogold labeling with an antiserum against the five structural proteins of PYDV showed that viral proteins accumulate mainly in the nucleus (Lin et al., 1987). In situ hybridization demonstrated that (\u2212)-strand genomic RNAs are found only in nuclei of infected plants whereas the (+)-strand RNA sequences are in both nuclei and cytoplasm (Martins et al., 1998). Immunofluorescence and immunogold labeling showed that N and L proteins are in viroplasms in the nucleus and the M2 protein is more generally distributed within the nucleus.ii.In the second group, the cytorhabdoviruses, e.g., LNYV, maturation of virus particles occurs in association with the ER, and particles accumulate in vesicles in the ER. Biochemical evidence suggests that the nucleus might be involved in the early stages of infection by members of this group.iii.This group comprises structures that appear to be rhabdovirus nucleocapsid cores lacking the surrounding membrane (Francki et al., 1985).When examining rhabdoviruses in the cell it must be remembered that the ONM is contiguous with the ER. Thus, nucleorhabdoviruses budding through the INM into the perinuclear space may further be included in vesicles derived from the outer membrane and be found in the cytoplasm. Similarly, cytorhabdoviruses that associate with the ER may affect the ONM giving an appearance of a nuclear involvement.\n",

            "text": "The first indication that the product of CaMV ORF V is analogous to the retrovirus pol gene came from sequence comparison (Toh et al., 1983). The N-terminal domain of ORF V has an aspartate protease motif (Toruella et al., 1989) that autocatalytically cleaves an N-terminal doublet of polypeptides (20 and 22 kDa) from in vitro translated ORF V transcript. Mutants of the protease active site are not processed. This fits with other features of the replication cycle described below. ORF V was expressed in yeast as a 60-kDa protein that had RT activity on a synthetic template (Takatsuji et al., 1986). In contrast, expression of ORF V in E. coli gave a protein of 78 kDa, the size expected from that ORF, but it did not have any RT activity. An activity gel analysis revealed that RT activity associated with CaMV particles is also 60 kDa (Takatsuji et al., 1992). Deletion analysis showed that removal of between 143 and 185 N-terminal amino acids from the E. coli-expressed protein gave RT activity similar to that of the yeast-expressed protein. This suggests that CaMV RT is translated as an inactive precursor form that is converted to the active form by proteolytic processing. It is presumed that this is by the N-terminal aspartate protease activity.",

The predicted 87-kDa product was detected and was processed to give 62-kDa and 55-kDa proteins. Sequencing showed that these proteins were N-coterminal. Both proteins exhibited RT and DNA polymerase activities but only the 55-kDa protein had RNase H activity. The precise weights of the 62- and 55-kDa proteins were determined by mass spectrometry (Laco et al., 1995) enabling the C-termini to be identified. Mutagenesis of the putative active site of the aspartate protease prevents the 87-kDa protein being processed in insect cells. Using antisera to specific fragments of the RTBV ORF III product, Hay et al. (1994) detected a 13.5-kDa protein corresponding to the aspartate protease in extracts from infected plants. The protease antibody labeled the surface of the virus particle. Antibodies against the RT domain identified proteins of 68, 65, and 56 kDa, the latter two probably corresponding to the 62- and 55-kDa protein found on expression of this ORF in insect cells (Laco and Beachy, 1994).",

It is suggested that there are specific receptors on the nuclear membrane for the CP which interacts with the import receptor, importin \u03b1. The virus particles disassemble and the dsDNA of the infecting particle moves into the nucleus, where the overlapping nucleotides at the gaps are removed, and the gaps are covalently closed to form a full dsDNA. The covalently closed DNA associates with host histones to form minichromosomes that are the template used by the host enzyme, DNA-dependent RNA polymerase II, to transcribe two RNAs of 19S and 35S.",

RTBV CP has several NLSs located within both N- and C-terminal regions (Guerra-Peraza et al., 2005). As with CaMV, RTBV CP interacts with importin \u03b1, but it is the C-terminal NLS that interacts and not the N-terminal one as with CaMV. It is thought that the N- and C-terminal NLSs may both be involved with importing the DNA into the nucleus, one effecting docking and the other the actual entry. The \u201cstrong stop\u201d DNA has a methionine initiator tRNA at its 5\u2032 end ((Bao and Hull, 1993). However, the discontinuity at the (+)-strand priming site does not map to the PPT site predicted from the sequence but to a site about 1400 base pairs away (Bao and Hull, 1992). Furthermore, both the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 termini at this discontinuity are heterogeneous in position giving structures varying from a gap of 10 nucleotides to an overlap of 103 nucleotides.",

(1987) showed that Agrobacterium containing tandem repeats of MSV DNA inoculated to whole maize plants led to symptoms of MSV infection. Since MSV DNA is not mechanically transmissible, and intact virus can infect only by means of an insect vector, this experiment provided a very sensitive demonstration that Agrobacterium could interact with a monocotyledon. Elmer et al., 1988a, Elmer et al., 1988b adapted the agroinfection procedure of Grimsley et al. (1987) to provide a simple and efficient assay for TGMV replication. They produced transgenic N. benthamiana plants containing multiple tandem copies of TGMV B-DNA. They found that an inoculum containing as few as 2000 Agrobacterium cells containing TGMV A-DNA could produce 100% virus infection. Agroinfection is also a highly efficient way of introducing DNAs A and B together into N. benthamiana (Hayes et al., 1988b). The technique has also been extended to Digitaria streak virus (Donson et al., 1988), MSV in various species of Poaceae (Boulton et al., 1989), and ACMV (Morris et al., 1988, Klinkenberg et al., 1989).",

            "text": "The origin of TGMV (+)-strand synthesis has been studied in detail (reviewed by Hanley-Bowdoin et al., 1999) and has been compared with those of other begomoviruses and of curtoviruses. The features of the TGMV (+)-strand origin are illustrated in Figure 7.26\n. The origin is in the left-hand side of the common region and overlaps the promoter for AC61 (also termed AL61) (described in Chapter 6, Section VIII, B, 1, a). Six cis elements have been identified in this region.\u25cfThe hairpin element is common to all geminivirus genomes (Arguello-Astorga et al., 1994). This comprises a GC-rich stem and an AT-rich loop, and mutagenesis demonstrates that it is the structure of the stem rather than the sequence that is essential for its activity. The stems of mastreviruses are much longer than those of members of the other genera. The 5\u2032-TAATATTAC loop is conserved in all geminiviruses and is found in the (+)-strand origins of other nucleic acids that replicate by rolling circle. There is some sequence flexibility in the loop sequence but the cleavage is between the TT|AC as noted above.\u25cfThe binding site for rep has several features: (i) it is virus specific (Table 7.4\n) but has some conserved sequence; (ii) the GGAT repeat is an absolute requirement; (iii) the spacing between the repeats is important; and (iv) the spacing between the binding site and the cleavage site is important. Less is known about how the Reps of mastreviruses recognize their origins. No sequences analogous to the binding sites described above have been found and mastreviruses do not have the same degree of specificity, as do the other two genera. It has been suggested that mastrevirus Rep proteins bind to reiterated sequences in the stem of the hairpin (Arguello-Astorga et al., 1994), but electron microscopy of WDV Rep/DNA complexes indicated that the binding site is in a similar site to those of the other two genera (Sanz-Burgos and Gutierrez, 1998).\u25cfBegomovirus and curtovirus (+)-strand origins share binding sites for two transcription factors, the TATA box and the G box. Neither of the host transcription factors binding sites is required for virus replication.\u25cfThe two other elements are the AG motif and the CA motif (Figure 7.26A). The AG motif is essential for virus replication (Orozco et al., 1998) but has no detectable role in transcription of AC61. Deletion of the CA motif reduced TGMV replication 20-fold, and mutagenesis suggested that it acts as an efficiency element. Although the mechanism by which these elements operate has not been determined, it has been suggested that they may bind plant factors required for replication (Hanley-Bowdoin et al., 1999).\n",

MSV Rep dimerizes and it is suggested that, as the monomer has only one active tyrosine for cleavage, the additional tyrosine in the dimeric form would be available for a second cleavage or a ligation reaction (Horv\u00e1th et al., 1998). In a study on WDV Rep and RepA using DNase footprinting and chemical cross-linking, Missich et al. (2000) showed that these replication proteins form large nucleoprotein complexes near the TATA boxes of the virion-sense and complementary-sense promoters. Oligomerization of both proteins is dependent on pH with octomers being formed at pH\u22647.0 while at pH\u22657.4 the predominant form is a monomer. Preformed oligomers interact very poorly with DNA. They suggest that there is a stepwise assembly of the protein\u2013DNA complex with the monomers interacting with the DNA and then with other monomers to assemble the oligomeric structure.",

Curtovirus, topocuvirus, and begomovirus Rep proteins have this LXCXE motif as does the RepA/Rep protein of mastreviruses. However, the Rep proteins of some geminiviruses, e.g., CSMV and TGMV, do not have an LXCXE motif (Horv\u00e1th et al., 1998, Arguello-Astorga et al., 2004) and, although mutagenesis of this motif in BYDV reduces the Rep binding capacity, it does not abolish the replication of the virus (Liu et al., 1999).

However, for this to occur, Rep must be expressed from the incoming virus. Therefore there must be enough capability in the newly infected cell to initiate (\u2212)-strand synthesis to give the dsDNA for transcription of the mRNA for Rep.

In vitro tests with E. coli-expressed protein show that the BBTV Rep protein has site-specific cleaving and joining activity (Hafner et al., 1997a). In FBNYV, five of the DNA segments appear to encode a Rep protein (Timchenko et al., 1999). Site-specific DNA cleavage and nucleotide transfer activities have been shown in vitro for those from DNAs 1 and 2 (Reps 1 and 2) and the essential tyrosine residue that catalyzes these reactions has been identified by mutagenesis. Rep 1 and 2 proteins hydrolyze ATP, and this activity is essential for multiplication of the viral DNA. Each of the five Rep proteins initiated replication of the DNA species by which it was encoded but only Rep2 was capable of replication of all the six DNAs that did not encode a Rep protein. Thus, only one of the Reps is a master Rep (M-Rep), and this is capable of triggering replication of heterologous nanovirus DNAs (Timchenko et al., 2000).",

However, the 20-kDa protein encoded by DNA-C (DNA-10) does contain this motif and also an F-box associated with binding to a ubiquitin ligase (a plant SKP1 homolog) (Aronson et al., 2000). The protein from DNA-C, named Clink (cell cycle link), binds to RB and stimulates viral replication; the product of BBTV DNA-C (DNA-5), described above, is a homolog of Clink. From studies on the expression of Clink in Arabidopsis, Lageix et al. (2007) showed that it interacts with retinoblastoma-related proteins and affects cell cycle regulation. However, Clink is not an absolute requirement for infection of N. benthamiana.

Mutation rates are measured as \u03bc=mutations/base/replication round (m/b/r) and, as well as technical difficulties (discussed by Tromas and Elena, 2010), one of the difficulties of obtaining realist values in vivo is determining the number of replication rounds.

Because of the range of variation in HR, Lai (1992) divided this category into homologous and aberrant homologous. Homologous recombinants have no sequence alterations in comparison with the parental molecules whereas aberrant homologous recombinants contain mutations, deletions, or insertions at, or close to the insertion site. In a further analysis of RNA recombinants, Nagy and Simon (1997) proposed three classes of recombination (Figure 7.31A\n).\u25cfClass 1, termed similarity-essential recombination, has substantial sequence similarity between parental RNAs. There can be two types of products, precise and imprecise recombinants, similar to the homologous and aberrant homologous of Lai (1992).\u25cfClass 2 recombination, similarity-nonessential recombination, occurs when there are no similar regions between the parents. It is thought that features, such as transesterification, RdRp binding sites, and secondary structure, play a role in the recombination event (reviewed by Chetverin, 1999).\u25cfClass 3 recombination, similarity-assisted recombination, combines features from both classes 1 and 2 recombination. In this class, there are sequence similarities between the parental RNAs, but additional RNA determinants on only one of the parental RNAs are required for efficient recombination. This form of recombination has been reported for PVX (Draghici and Varrelmann, 2010).\n",

            "text": "Three mechanisms have been proposed for RNA recombination (reviewed by Nagy and Simon, 1997).i.The replicase-driven template switching model involves four elements, three RNAs [the primary RNA template (donor strand), the strand synthesized from the primary strand (nascent strand), and the acceptor strand], and the replicase complex (Figure 7.31B). Synthesis of the nascent strand on the donor strand is halted or slowed temporarily which enables either the RdRp or nascent strand to interact with the acceptor strand leading to template switching. Thus, there are two types of signal on the donor or nascent strand, one (pausing or arrest signal) that halts the RdRp but from which it can escape and the other (terminator signal) that releases the RdRp from the RNAs. It is thought that these signals may be similar to those involved in template switching by DNA-dependent DNA polymerases and RT and to be the sequence and/or secondary structure of the donor or nascent RNA. These regions that promote RdRp pausing or termination will constitute recombination hotspots. To enable template switching, the RdRp must be able to bind to the acceptor RNA and use the 3\u2032 end of the nascent RNA as a primer to reinitiate RNA synthesis. Little is known about the actual mechanism of the switching of template by the RdRp though there are several models. In the processive model, it is suggested that when the RdRp approaches the heteroduplex region it pauses and either switches to the acceptor sequence or slides backwards 10\u201320 nucleotides enabling the nascent strand to hybridize to the acceptor strand. In the non-processive model, the RdRp is suggested to dissociate from the donor strand and then reassociates with the nascent and acceptor RNAs.ii.The RNA breakage and ligation model is similar to the well-characterized DNA breakage and ligation system. It has not been formally demonstrated for RNA recombination.iii.The breakage-induced template switching model is similar to the replicase-driven template switching model with the switch being induced by pausing of the replicase at a break in the template RNA. Because of the lability of RNA, it can be difficult to distinguish this model from the replicase-driven template switching model.\n",

Among the determinants for early stage dissociation are:\u2013truncated template formed say by limited RNA degradation by a cellular replicase;\u2013the sequence composition of the template. The major factor promoting HR appears to be complementarity between the acceptor and the nascent strand (Figlerowicz and Bujarski, 1998). On the other hand, the formation of local RNA\u2013RNA heteroduplexes between recombining substrates appears to force the replicase switch during non-HR (Figlerowicz, 2000). Weak A\u2013U base pairing between the template and nascent strands has been suggested to promote replicase pausing/dissociation of BMV (Nagy and Bujarski, 1996, Nagy and Bujarski, 1997).\u2013Strand of template. Homologous crossovers occur more readily during (+)-strand synthesis rather than during (\u2212)-strand synthesis (Olsthoorn et al., 2002).\u2013Secondary and tertiary structures in the RNA. There is evidence that recombination sites in BMV and tombusviruses are associated with secondary structure in the template RNA that would induce pausing of the replicase (Nagy and Bujarski, 1993, White and Morris, 1995, Kim and Kao, 2001). Replication enhancers, such as the RIII region of TBSV DI RNA (Figure 7.17) appear to be involved in recombination (Cheng and Nagy, 2003); the RIII region has a high affinity for viral replicase proteins which could help in the \u201clanding\u201d of a dissociated replicase/nascent RNA complex (White and Nagy, 2004).\n",

Mutations within the HEL-like domain of BMV 1a protein affected the nature of recombinants, possibly due to altered frequency, location, and/or duration of pausing during RNA synthesis (Nagy et al., 1995); these mutations within the HEL region may affect the ability to unwind secondary structures or may influence viral proteins 1a\u20132a binding, which could affect the overall stability of the replicase, its interactions with the RNA, and its ability to switch between templates.

In vitro studies have mainly focused on bromoviruses and tombusviruses and it is suggested that these have a higher recombination frequency than many other virus groups. In the in vivo situation, there can be strong selection pressures and many approaches use strong positive selection to obtain recombinants. One way of overcoming this is to use viral RNAs containing silent markers.

For interspecies recombination, there will be significant homology between two viral variants. As described in Chapter 14, Section IV, A, these variants are likely to cross-protect against each other and so unless they are co-inoculated, it will be unlikely that they will replicate in the same cell compartment. However, viral populations exist as a \u201ccloud\u201d of quasispecies (Chapter 2, Section III, A) which will be replicating together, and thus there is a strong likelihood of recombination. To support intraspecies, intragenus, and/or intergenus RNA recombination, multiple virus strains must coinfect the same host cell and replicate in the same membrane compartment. Coinfections may be rare, especially when the virus strains are ecologically or geographically isolated. If there is successful coinfection, mechanistic restraints, such as the level of sequence dissimilarity, or the specificity of viral RdRp may prevent the formation of viable hybrids. Even if recombination occurs, the recombinants are likely to be deleterious and thus purified from the population (Pinel-Galzi et al., 2009).",

            "text": "The processes by which recombination occurs within geminiviruses are still quite poorly characterized but probably involve a number of different mechanisms. Recombination breakpoints in geminiviral genomes are generally not randomly distributed (Martin et al., 2011b) and cluster either within discrete recombination hot spots less frequently in cold spots. These uneven breakpoint distributions are in many cases caused by underlying differences in the rates of recombination in different parts of ssDNA virus genomes. Mechanistic factors that might influence site-to-site variations in basal recombination rates across these genomes include:\u2013Replication origins of geminiviruses, but not nanoviruses, are recombination hot spots (Lefeuvre et al., 2009). These sites comprise a 10- to 30-nt-long inverted repeat sequence capable of forming a hairpin structure that contains within its loop a highly conserved nonanucleotide sequence that defines the actual replication origin. Recombination experiments in geminiviruses (Stenger et al., 1994) have shown that this genome site is a mechanistically predisposed recombination hot spot because of the replicational release of viral genomes from genomic concatomers. When these concatomers either arise following a copy-choice mediated polymerase strand switch or break and are rescued by host double-stranded break repair pathways (i.e., by RDR), recombinants that are replicationally released will have one breakpoint at the site of the strand switch/breakage and another at the origin.\u2013Sequence similarity. The efficiency with which HR can be used to replicationally repair broken ss and dsDNA molecules is strongly dependent on the degrees of similarity between broken sites and those of the unbroken molecules used as templates during recombinational repair. Recombination in geminiviruses tends to occur more frequently at genome sites where the two parental genomes share between 5 and 14 identical nucleotides than at sites where they share longer runs of identical sequence; recombination can also occur at quite a low frequency between two nucleotides that are nonidentical in both parents (Garcia-Andres et al., 2007).\u2013ssDNA secondary structure. As noted above the geminivirus replication origin is a recombination hotspot and forms a stable hair-loop structure. Computational predictions indicate that additional uncharacterized ssDNA structures probably exist within many ssDNA virus genomes (Garcia-Andres et al., 2007) and the possibility exists that these too may facilitate recombination. Although the overall genomic secondary structures of recombinant genomes can vary quite substantially from those of their parents, there is evidence of strong selection pressures in geminiviruses for recombinants to maintain parent-like secondary structures (Martin et al., 2011b).\u2013Transcription\u2013replication clashes. Geminivirus genes are expressed from both the virion and complementary sense strands. The complementary sense genes are transcribed in the opposite direction to RCR leading to the possibility for replication complex\u2013transcription complex clashes. Geminiviruses tend to have more detectable recombination events and measurably higher estimated population-scaled recombination rates in their complementary sense genes than they do in their virion sense genes (Martin et al., 2011a). The imbalance between recombination rates in the virion and complementary sense genes is particularly apparent when considering only recombination occurring between very closely related sequences suggesting that strongly homology dependent copy-choice recombination may be a particularly important mechanism of replication re-initiation following interruption due to transcription\u2013replication complex clashes.\u2013Differential degrees of ssDNA exposure within minichromosomes. Transcriptionally active geminiviral covalently ccDNA forms associate with host histones forming minichromosomes (Pilartz and Jeske, 2003). Recombination breakpoint hot spots in begomovirus genomes co-localize very closely with genome sites that are exposed within minichromosomes to host transcription and replication factors. These sites are also apparently the most common sites of dsDNA breakage during begomovirus infections (Jeske et al., 2001) and it is therefore likely that at least part of the reason that these regions are recombination hot spots is that they are hypersensitive to either physical breakage or host nuclease attack.\n",

Assuming that 10 viral replication cycles occurred during the experiment, the recombination rate per base and replication cycle was of the order of 2\u20134\u00d710\u22125 indicating that recombination is very frequent in the infection cycle of this virus. It is not known if this is DNA and/or RNA recombination.",

In certain banana (Musa) cultivars there have been apparently spontaneous outbreaks of BSV, especially during tissue culture and breeding programs. The first example was in tetraploids from variety Obino l\u2019Ewai (AAB genome) crossed with variety Calcutta 4 (AA genome). The evidence for episomal infections arising from integrated sequences is: (i) many of the tetraploid lines had up to 100% infection of BSOLV after crossing symptomless parent plants. Tissue culture plantlets of Obino l\u2019Ewai from symptomless mother plants had lower rates of infection and those of Calcutta 4 no infection; (ii) PCR of total DNA from Obino l\u2019Ewai using BSV primers and Southern blotting of that DNA probed with BSV sequences gave positive results even though no virus could be detected by immuno-electron microscopy or by immune-capture PCR; (iii) sequencing of genomic clones from Obino l\u2019Ewai revealed a complex insert of BSV (Figure 7.32B\n), the sequence of which was>99% homologous to that of the episomal virus; (iv) the cloned products prepared by the sequence-specific amplification polymorphism (S-SAP) approach fell into three classes, one of which comprised Musa sequence interfacing BSV sequence; (v) fluorescent in situ hybridization revealed a major and a minor locus; (vii) fiber-stretch hybridization, in which chromosomes are denatured, spread, and then hybridized with fluorescent probes showed that the integrants were complex (Harper et al., 1999; Figure 7.32A). Two allelic copies of BSGFV have also been found in the Musa balbisiana (B) genome and none in the M. accumunata (A) genome which can be activated in triploid (AAB) and tetraploid (AAAB) varieties (Gayral et al., 2008); eBSImV is present as a single allelic form (Gayral et al., 2010). Only one of the allelic copies of BSGFV is replication competent (Gayral et al., 2008); both alleles are very similar in structure but the replication-competent form has many less mutations.eBSOLV and eBSGFV have complex integration patters comprising long stretches of contiguous viral sequence interspersed by fragments of non-contiguous and inverted sequences and possibly host sequences (Gayral et al., 2008, Ndowora et al., 1999; Figure 7.32B and C).",

Furthermore, their replication is thought to be controlled by host defense systems (Chapter 9). The Caulimoviridae use the DNA\u2192RNA\u2192DNA route to replicate their genomes with the DNA\u2192RNA phase being effected by a host enzymic system and the RNA\u2192DNA phase by virus-coded enzyme activities. How these viruses overcome the host constraints directed at the unrestrained replication of retrotransposons is unknown. However, the fact that the episomal replication mechanism does not involve integration into the host genome may play a part in this, as will virus-encoded suppressors of RNA silencing. The replication of viruses, such as BSV and TVCV, is episomal, and the integration of the viral sequences into the host genome only supplies the inoculum and is not an integral part of the replication mechanism. However, in considering the constraints on the reverse transcription route of replication it must be recognized that several animal retroviruses involve an integration stage and there is little, if any, episomal replication. It may be that other host defense systems, such as immune surveillance, not found in plants, play a role.",

Uncoating is believed to take place on ER membranes, followed by release of the nucleocapsid core into the cytoplasm. At this point, the replication cycles of the two genera diverge. For cytorhabdoviruses, the newly released core become transcriptionally active and associate with the ER to establish viroplasms that function in transcription of viral mRNAs (vmRNAs) and replication of genomic and antigenomic viral RNAs. Following translation of the vmRNAs, the viral proteins involved in replication accumulate in the viroplasm. Viral glycoproteins are targeted to cytoplasmic membranes or, possibly, the outer nuclear envelope (ONE). Maturation of cytorhabdoviruses takes place via matrix protein-mediated condensation of cores at sites of G protein accumulation in the ER. For nucleorhabdoviruses, released cores are transported into the nucleus through NPCs. Following transcription and export, vmRNAs are translated and viral proteins are imported into the nucleus, where they participate in replication and formation of large viroplasms. Morphogenesis of members of both genera occurs near the end of active transcription and replication and involves interaction of the M protein to coil the viral nucleocapsid and form associations with membrane-associated G protein. In the cytorhabdoviruses, EM observations suggest that budding occurs into proliferated ER associated with the viroplasms. At least two models are proposed for morphogenesis of nucleorhabdovirus virions. One model suggests that the inner nuclear envelope (INE) proliferates due to the redistribution of cytoplasmic membranes and invaginates to form intranuclear spherules, into which viral budding occurs. In the classical model, virus budding occurs through intact INE resulting in an expansion of the ONE. In both models, mature virions accumulate in the perinuclear spaces of infected cells, where they may be reacquired during subsequence vector feeding.",
