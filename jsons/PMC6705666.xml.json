Nonetheless, in most resource-limited countries, the relative contribution of different pathogens leading to respiratory illness-related deaths remains largely unknown. Understanding the etiologies of respiratory illness-related deaths is key to targeting resources and informing policies for the treatment and prevention of respiratory illnesses. In resource-limited settings, information on the cause of death is determined through clinical diagnosis prior to death or, more frequently, verbal autopsy [3] because many deaths occur outside hospitals. The introduction and expansion of vaccination against major causes of childhood respiratory disease\u2013related mortality, such as measles, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae B, over the past decade and the availability of highly active antiretroviral treatment (HAART) [4] may have changed the relative roles of different etiologies of respiratory disease\u2013related mortality in sub-Saharan Africa. Moreover, with improved multipathogen diagnostic techniques, studies have suggested a more substantial role of respiratory viruses in severe acute respiratory illnesses in young children [5-8].",

However, few clinical postmortem examinations are currently performed [10], especially in sub-Saharan Africa where the respiratory disease burden is the highest [11]; this is partly attributed to a lack of resources and inadequate technical capacity to perform detailed postmortem examinations. Moreover, the poor understanding of the utility and practice of conventional autopsy allows for misinformation and stigma among patients and clinicians alike, hampering informed consent, which is required for the procedure. Families can be reluctant to consent to autopsy fearing that the bodies of their loved ones will be disfigured [12].",

At enrollment, we collected sociodemographic and clinical data and obtained nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs from consented patients. We then followed participants until discharge (or death) and abstracted additional data from the hospital files on the results of laboratory investigations, discharge diagnoses, and outcome of hospitalization. In addition, we included children who died of respiratory illness (per parental or guardian interview or physician\u2019s assessment) at admission or soon after admission, regardless of enrollment while patients were still alive and collected as much data as available from hospital records. Trained grief counselors approached parents or guardians of deceased children and offered them counseling before seeking consent to perform postmortem examination. We performed MITS to obtain lung tissue specimens followed by the conventional autopsy to collect multiple tissue specimens. Tissues were examined through histopathology and tested using multiple laboratory techniques to identify etiologies potentially associated with respiratory disease\u2013related death. Figure 1 summarizes these procedures and specimen collection and testing.",

Many studies have relied on the clinical assessment to determine the cause of death despite well-documented discrepancies between the clinical diagnosis and findings from autopsy [19-21]. Even with the improvement in diagnostic tools currently available to physicians in high-resource countries, an autopsy can aid in detecting up to 30% of causes of deaths missed during clinical evaluation [22,23]; this figure may be higher in resource-limited settings. However, autopsy rates throughout the world have declined [10]. The idea of using MITS to aid in postmortem investigations in remote areas where the capacity to perform a full autopsy is limited, and modern imaging techniques are not available, is not new [24]. MITS may improve acceptance rates among communities where autopsy procedures can be culturally less acceptable or feasible [25].",

            "text": "Investigation of postmortem-collected specimens may identify etiologic agents, which are not suspected antemortem, which is particularly relevant for respiratory illnesses, as many respiratory pathogens can cause similar syndromic presentations. For example, a retrospective study of adenoviruses in autopsies of pediatric patients who died of pneumonia in South China identified adenovirus by PCR in 9.1% (16/175) of lung tissues [26]. Another example is undiagnosed deaths due to influenza virus infection. This could be blamed on late care-seeking (where influenza viruses may no longer be detected in upper respiratory specimens) or lack of accurate diagnostic tests in the health care system. A study conducted among 1611 coronial autopsy cases in Western Australia found influenza in 8% of deceased children (age <10 years), none of whom were suspected of having influenza during clinical evaluation [27]. Moreover, it is difficult to ascertain the contribution of complications due to coinfections, such as secondary bacterial infection following influenza or other infections that could contribute to death, without the evaluation of lung or other tissues in the postmortem setting. Respiratory illness associated with viruses or fungi can be particularly difficult to detect as part of the routine clinical evaluation because of the limitations associated with antemortem sampling and the low sensitivity of available tests (eg, rapid antigen tests and blood culture) [28,29]. Another added benefit of postmortem investigation can be the possibility to assess a child\u2019s neglect, abuse, and genetic conditions, which can go undetected until autopsy.",

This is a limitation of a hospital-based study, especially in our case, where most patients are referred from other health care facilities. Additional problems could include contamination of postmortem tissue during collection (a special concern when using MITS techniques) [30], but the hospital setting may minimize this risk compared with studies conducted at the community. Moreover, percutaneous sampling methods could miss areas of pathology [31]. However, in this study, we will be able to link results from tissues collected using MITS with those collected during the full autopsy and assess MITS methods. Finally, postmortem investigative studies are associated with the immediate widespread cellular degradation after death facilitating bacterial translocation [32]. Bacteria, fungi, and endotoxins can cross the mucosal barrier of the gastrointestinal tract, and interpretation of multipathogen molecular diagnostic results can be complicated as these pathogens can multiply after death, masking the real etiologic agent. We hope to overcome the challenge of interpreting the relevance of pathogens detected using TAC testing by adding clinical history and information on the course of illness while a patient is alive and contrasting findings with that from different testing methodologies and tissue specimens to assist with the interpretation of etiology.",
