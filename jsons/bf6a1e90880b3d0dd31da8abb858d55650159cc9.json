Most patients infected with the novel coronavirus had mild and moderate illness, and severe illness often experienced dyspnea after 1 week. In cases of critical illness, patients progressed rapidly to acute respiratory failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome, metabolic acidosis, coagulopathy, and septic shock. Early identification of risk factors for critical illness facilitated appropriate provision of supportive care and rapid access to the intensive care unit (ICU) when required. For patients with mild and moderate illness, general isolation treatment is required and ICU-care is not needed unless the condition worsens. Thus, early prognosis prediction would help reduce mortality and alleviate the shortage of medical resources.",

The cutoff values of neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and age were calculated based on the maximum Youden index (sensitivity + specificity \u2212 1). Comparison of the differences between the two cohorts was conducted using the t-test, Chi-square test, or Mann-Whitney U test. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analyses (stepwise forward method) were performed to identify the most useful predictive factor for predicting critical illness incidence. p-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Analyses were performed using SPSS 22.0 statistical package (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). R software version 3.6.3 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria) was used to establish LASSO regression analysis, nomogram, Harrell' concordance index, calibration, decision and clinical impact curves. LASSO regression is a type of machine learning regression, which was used to select independent risk factors that affect outcomes. The regression was generated using the glmnet package in R. Harrell's concordance index is routinely used to measure how well a variable or model predicts the time to a censored event. The index was generated using the rms package in R [8] . The calibration curve reflects the relationship between the prediction rate and the actual occurrence rate. The curve was also generated using the rms package in R. The abscissa is the prediction probability. The prediction model is used to predict the probability of the event, and 0 to 1 means the probability of the event is 0 to 100%. The ordinate is the actual probability (actual incident rate) of the patient. The red line is the fit line, which represents the actual value corresponding to the predicted value [9] . The decision curve is a useful tool to evaluate the clinical application of the model, which displays estimates of the standardized net benefit by the probability threshold used to categorize observations as 'high risk. ' The clinical impact curve is an alternative plot for the output of the decision curve. Decision and clinical impact curves were generated using the DecisionCurve package in R [10] .",

Recent research showed that 26% of patients received ICU care, and mortality was 4.3% [15] . The number of patients in Wuhan and other regions is increasing rapidly. The current difficulty is the shortage of medical resources, especially critical care resources. Early identification critical illness and risk stratification management will help alleviate insufficient medical resources and might reduce mortality. Recent studies have reported that low lymphocyte-to-C-reactive protein ratio [16] , platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio [17] , and thrombocytopenia [18] may be associated with critical illness. In addition, smoking and COPD have been associated with COVID-19 [19] . These may not have influenced the results in the present study because of the low number of subjects (a total of 10 smoking and 6 COPD patients). The COVID-19 pneumonia is not severe in the early stage, but the critical patients deteriorated on 7-14 days of illness course and entered a state of severe pneumonia and acute respiratory failure. The critical or death patients with COVID-19 infection were mostly of an old age and had comorbidities [20] . In the study, the critical ill patients were all over 50 years old. The decrease of lymphocyte count was related to the progress of the disease. It is unclear why lymphopenia is associated with severe illness. It has been hypothesized that COVID-19 may act on T lymphocytes, and T lymphocyte damage is an important factor that causes deterioration of the patient's condition [21] . In addition, a high leukocyte count is common in critically ill patients because damaged cells induce innate inflammation in the lungs, which is largely mediated by proinflammatory macrophages and granulocytes [22] . The NLR was a widely used marker for the assessment of the severity of bacterial infections and the prognosis of patients with pneumonia and tumors [21, [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] .",

Second, most of patients are still in hospital, whose condition maybe change in follow-up, and the study has not included the final survival outcome of patients.
