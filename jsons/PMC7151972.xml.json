            "text": "Dating to at least 1888, there are several reports describing pathologic findings of intestinal perforation in neonates as the cause of death suggestive of NEC.1, 2, 3 The first report of a successfully treated infant with a localized ileal perforation that was described as a disease resembling NEC is attributed to Agerty4 in 1943. Subsequently, in 1953 Schmid and Quaiser5 first used the term necrotizing enterocolitis. In 1964 Berdon6 reported the clinical and radiographic findings of 21 patients with NEC. Then in 1975 Santulli7 first hypothesized that the development of NEC had three essential components: injury to the intestinal mucosa, the presence of bacteria, and the availability of a metabolic substrate (to be taken as the presence of enteral feedings). This characterization remains a central tenet of our understanding of the overall pathophysiology of NEC (discussed later). Over the past several decades the management of infants with NEC has evolved from aggressive early operation to supportive care with the increasing realization that most infants can be managed, at least initially, nonoperatively.",

Bell's criteria (Table 94-1\n) can be summarized as indicating clinical findings suspicious for NEC (Bell's stage I), definitive NEC (Bell's stage II), and advanced NEC (Bell's stage III). In general, a stage I infant manifests clinical criteria that raise suspicion without definitive evidence such as pneumatosis intestinalis or bloody stool. In stage II, or definitive disease, there is nearly always evidence for pneumatosis intestinalis (Fig. 94-1\n). The hallmark of advanced disease is the appearance of pneumoperitoneum or other clinical findings to suggest irreversible tissue damage with perforation. In 1979 the International Classification of Diseases established a code for death from NEC, thereby allowing more precise epidemiologic and outcome analyses. Currently, the optimum surgical approach in order to realize the best short- and long-term outcomes in infants with intestinal perforation secondary to NEC remains the subject of intense scrutiny via ongoing clinical trials.",

            "text": "Although the overall reported incidence of NEC among newborn infants is relatively low and reported to fall between 5% and 10%.9, 10, 11 The true incidence is unknown given a number of either early or suspicious cases of NEC that cannot be accurately tabulated. Conversely, the number of infants that are under consideration for either having or developing NEC can be quite high and is directly related to degree of prematurity. Perhaps more puzzling, the incidence of NEC varies significantly within the United States and throughout the developed world. For example, the worldwide incidence of NEC in very-low-birth-weight (VLBW, >1500 g) infants varies from 1% to 2% in Japan, 7% in Austria, 10% in Greece, 14% in Argentina, and 28% in Hong Kong.12, 13, 14, 15, 16 The reasons for these disparities are unclear but are likely multifactorial including biologic (e.g., genetic) and environmental (e.g., variation in practice patterns). Irrespective of geographic reporting location, it is clear the incidence of NEC varies according to degree of prematurity and birth weight. NEC accounts for 1% to 7% of all NICU admissions in the United States, or 1 to 3 cases per 1000 live births.9,\n17,\n18 In VLBW infants, the disease occurs in approximately 10% to 12%, but ranges between 2% and 22%, depending on the center of inquiry.11,\n15,\n19\n",

A relatively large multicenter survey of VLBW infants noted an incidence of 10.1% for definite NEC (stage II) and 17.2% for suspected NEC (stage I), although there was considerable intercenter variability.20 In another study, the incidence of definite NEC versus suspected NEC was 8.6% and 18.6%, respectively.18 The observed variability in these and many other series may be underestimating the true frequency of NEC because the incidence is often defined as the total number of cases of NEC divided by the total number of patients admitted to the NICU. Thus these figures may include many premature infants who die within the first several days of life and before enteric feedings and therefore are unlikely attributable to NEC. In consideration of this, a notable historical study that excluded early neonatal deaths and included only infants who had been fed reported an incidence of 15%.21\n",

It is estimated that only 7% to 13% of all NEC cases occur in full-term infants.22,\n23 Kliegman and Fanaroff24 reported that the mean gestational age of 123 patients with NEC was 31 weeks (average birth weight, 1460 g). Infants with extremely low birth weight (ELBW) (<1000 g) and those 28 weeks' gestational age or younger are at greatest risk.25,\n26 In a large multicenter prospective study from the NICHD Neonatal Research Network involving 4438 infants weighing between 501 and 1500 g, Lemons11 demonstrated an inverse relationship between the incidence of NEC and birth weight. Specifically, the incidence of NEC was highest in infants weighing between 501 and 750 g (14%) and declined with increasing weight: 751 to 1000 g (9%), 1001 to 1250 g (5%), and 1251 to 1500 g (3%). These findings have been confirmed by others23,\n27,\n28 and extended to document an inverse relationship between the age at onset of NEC and gestational age. Infants in whom NEC developed in the first week of life were more mature (average gestational age, 36.1 weeks) than those in whom NEC developed after 1 week of age (average gestational age, 33.4 weeks). Complications were more common, and the mortality rate was higher in patients with early-onset disease. Wilson29 calculated the birth weight\u2013specific, weekly attack rate in patients with NEC and found the risk period for NEC decreased as birth weight increased. They found a consistent pattern of sharply declining risk with attainment of age equivalent to 35 to 36 weeks' gestation. From these observations the authors speculated that functional maturation of the GI tract may play a principal role in determining the risk for NEC.",

This study reinforces previous studies that gut stimulation protocols are beneficial to VLBW infants41 and that initiation of a minimal-volume feeding protocol for 7 to 10 days followed by modest advancement of feeding may greatly reduce the incidence of NEC.42 However, there are no contemporary studies that specifically address this issue.",

Indomethacin blocks prostaglandin synthetase, thus causing vasoconstriction.

Two randomized controlled trials involving more than 500 LBW premature infants receiving early low-dose indomethacin versus placebo for closure of a PDA demonstrated no difference in the subsequent incidence of NEC.47,\n48 According to several recent Cochrane Reviews, ibuprofen appears to be as effective as indomethacin in leading to a PDA closure and with fewer reported cases of NEC or SIP.49 Interestingly, although the continuous infusion of indomethacin for a PDA leads to fewer alterations in cerebral, renal, and mesenteric blood flow compared with bolus infusion, to date, insufficient evidence exists to demonstrate that this results in a lowered risk of NEC or SIP.50 Earlier indomethacin may be associated with increased incidence of SIP but protection from NEC. Moreover, a PDA itself may predispose to NEC, independent of indomethacin.",

This effect has been shown to be mediated by PAF and attenuated by PAF receptor antagonists.127 Confirmatory studies in human neonates with NEC identified significantly elevated plasma levels of TNF-\u03b1 compared with controls.99 Pentoxifylline, a drug that has multiple effects including inhibition of production of TNF-\u03b1, was shown to reduce bowel necrosis in an adult rat ischemia-reperfusion model of bowel injury, as well as the incidence of NEC in a neonatal rat model.128 Furthermore, two separate studies129,\n130 have demonstrated a significant reduction in the severity of NEC in neonatal rats after intraperitoneal TNF-\u03b1 antibody prophylaxis. However, the A(-308) and A(-238) allele variants of the promoter region of the TNF-\u03b1 gene, which were reportedly associated with higher TNF-\u03b1 production, fail to show any influence on the risk and course of NEC in VLBW infants.131\n",

Throughout the study, the group that received arginine supplementation had significantly higher mean plasma arginine levels than the control group did. Interestingly, in both groups the infants in whom NEC developed had significantly lower plasma arginine levels at the time of diagnosis than their respective peers did. It is not known whether the decreased arginine levels represent increased utilization for NO production, consumption for the synthesis of other proteins, or decreased enteral absorption.

Within several hours of stimulation, NOS-2 expression and activity within the intestinal epithelium increase up to 15-fold and result in the production of large amounts of NO.135 Although the low levels of NO produced by the constitutive isoforms of NOS may play a homeostatic role in the GI tract, sustained release of NO as a result of up-regulation of NOS-2 has been suggested to have deleterious effects by inducing cellular injury and failure of the mucosal barrier.135,\n156,\n157 This is thought to occur by the reaction of excess NO with superoxide (O2-) to produce peroxynitrite (ONOO-), a potent reactive nitrogen intermediate that may trigger cytotoxic processes including lipid peroxidation and DNA damage.157, 158, 159 In a prospective study investigating NOS-2 expression in the intestine of infants undergoing resection for NEC, Ford160 demonstrated marked up-regulation of NOS-2 gene expression in the intestinal epithelium and increased apoptosis of enterocytes in the apical villi. In addition, increased levels of nitrotyrosine residues were detected in the apical villi, thus suggesting that the mucosal injury and increased apoptosis were mediated through the formation of NO and peroxynitrite. In a neonatal rat hypoxia model of NEC in which breast milk\u2013fed animals were compared with formula-fed animals, Nadler and colleagues161 demonstrated a significantly higher incidence of NEC, NOS-2 expression, and enterocyte apoptosis along with decreased IL-12 mRNA in the formula-fed group than in the breast milk\u2013fed group. The decreased IL-12 expression is thought to be mediated by NO and theorized to contribute to intestinal injury by attenuating bacterial clearance. Furthermore, Whithouse has shown in a rat model that the progression of NEC to intestinal ischemia is associated with a shift from nitric oxide to superoxide production by the intestinal vascular endothelium.162\n",

In other animal experiments, exogenous PAF administration results in severe bowel necrosis168; endogenous intestinal production of PAF is up-regulated in response to various stimuli including LPS, hypoxia, and TNF-\u03b1127,\n169, 170, 171; and administration of PAF receptor antagonist, or PAF acetylhydrolase (PAF-degrading enzyme), reduces the risk for NEC.170,\n172,\n173 In human studies, PAF acetylhydrolase activity has been demonstrated to be present in human breast milk; it has also been shown to be decreased in neonates, with levels approaching adult enzyme activity at around 6 weeks of life, and has been found to be deficient in infants with NEC.99,\n174,\n175 In a prospective study of 164 infants at risk for NEC, Rabinowitz176 monitored serial plasma levels of PAF and PAF-related lipids (PAF-LL) to investigate the changes that occur with NEC. There was a significantly higher peak in PAF-LL levels in infants in whom NEC developed than in controls. In addition, rising PAF-LL levels were positively correlated with progression of the severity of NEC; these levels returned to baseline levels during recovery. With the studies mentioned, a systematic review56 of serologic tests in diagnosing NEC suggested that PAF is one of the better performing markers for NEC with a sensitivity of 92% and specificity of 84% despite the considerable heterogeneity between the studies.",

Touloukian202 emphasized the high incidence of perinatal physiologic stressors that may primarily or secondarily cause intestinal ischemia. Chief among these factors are hypoxic and hypotensive episodes, exchange transfusions through the umbilical vein, umbilical artery catheters, cardiovascular lesions, and serum hyperviscosity. The \u201cdiving reflex\u201d in which blood is preferentially diverted away from the splanchnic circulation in order to maintain adequate perfusion of the heart and brain has been hypothesized to occur during these episodes.203 During periods of low blood flow and subsequent reperfusion, Parks204 found that a reaction among xanthine oxidase, hypoxanthine, and molecular oxygen results in a burst of superoxide radical production. These free radicals may cause damage to cellular and mitochondrial membranes and alter the permeability of the intestinal mucosal barrier. Although animal studies provide support for this theory, clinical correlation has been lacking, and prospective clinical trials have not been able to consistently establish an association between a hypoxic event and the development of NEC.205\n",

All of the key mediators identified in NEC (PAF, NO, LPS, TNF-\u03b1) have been shown to cause apoptosis of intestinal epithelial cells.160,\n207, 208, 209 In a neonatal rat model of NEC involving formula-fed animals exposed to hypoxia and cold stress, Jilling210 demonstrated a marked increase in apoptosis in the epithelial layer of the NEC group in comparison with mother-fed controls. The accelerated apoptosis was shown to precede gross morphologic changes in the intestinal epithelium. Administration of a pan-caspase inhibitor to inhibit intestinal apoptosis resulted in a significantly reduced rate of epithelial apoptosis, as well as a decreased incidence of NEC, thus suggesting that apoptosis was the underlying cause of the subsequent mucosal damage, ultimately leading to NEC.",

Beyond serving as a simple physical barrier, the dynamic interaction between the intestinal mucosa and colonizing microbes is an integral part of the innate immune system and is regulated by a system of pattern recognition receptors (PRR). During gut colonization, crosstalk between the system of PRR and commensal bacteria occurs, resulting in intestinal mucosal tolerance or hyporesponsiveness toward the enteric microbes in order to establish a symbiotic relationship. The PRR respond to microbial associated molecular patterns (MAMP) (i.e., LPS, flagellin, peptidoglycans) in order to modulate the cellular response through a variety of downstream signaling pathways (see Fig. 94-2). The PRR system includes the TLRs, which are largely responsible for sampling and interpreting the extracellular environment, and in this capacity, the TLRs have been implicated as an integral mechanism to the pathogenesis of NEC.184 Hackam and colleagues have shown that the LPS receptor, TLR4, is integral to intestinal mucosal repair in rodent models of NEC through its effects on enterocyte apoptosis and migration.216 Work by this same group has demonstrated increased expression of TLR4 in the human intestine that develops NEC. There is an intense and ongoing interest in this line of investigation as a primary determinant in establishing a symbiotic gut-microbe axis, which may provide protection against the development of NEC.",

In recent years the key role of the gastrointestinal tract as an immune system organ has been increasingly documented.227,\n228 Because the microbiota of the human GI tract has increasingly been identified as playing a key role in overall human health through this symbiotic relationship, gut colonization during the newborn period likely presents a particularly vulnerable time for innate immune system, human gut, and gut microbial community dysfunction to occur when this process is disrupted or delayed. The process of gut colonization has been elegantly documented to involve both environmental and genetic factors as evidenced by the findings in twins of similarities in gut microbiota.229 Moreover, the process is active and dynamic, undergoing a significant shift even in well newborns and infants throughout the first year of life.",

Bacteria in the bowel lumen and wall are present in up to 40% of cases and are occasionally found in gas cysts. Transmural necrosis, characterized by hyaline eosinophilia and loss of nuclear detail in the muscular layers, is present in advanced disease. Epithelial regeneration, formation of granulation tissue, and early fibrosis are often present during the resolution of NEC. This suggests a suppurative process lasting at least several days. Granulation tissue with mucosal and submucosal fibrosis may be seen adjacent to areas of active mucosal and submucosal necrosis and may account, in part, for late stricture formation. Thrombi are sometimes noted in small mesenteric vessels and in small arterioles of the submucosa. Small-vessel thrombosis within necrotic tissue is considered a secondary change.

Stool samples are commonly positive for occult blood and reducing substances. Book241 reasoned that intestinal mucosal damage from NEC leads to carbohydrate malabsorption. Poorly digested carbohydrates pass into the colon, where they are fermented and excreted in stool. The authors tested the stool of formula-fed infants for reducing substances with reagent (Clinitest) tablets and found that 71% of formula-fed infants in whom NEC developed had greater than 2+ reducing substances in their stool. Colonic bacterial fermentation increases the local production of d-lactate, which is absorbed and excreted by the kidneys. Garcia242 could show elevated urinary d-lactate levels in infants with NEC but not in control infants. With recovery from NEC or administration of enteral antibiotics, d-lactate excretion decreased. Similarly, hydrogen excretion in the breath is elevated when fermentation is increased. This test is helpful in ruling out NEC. A negative result on a breath hydrogen test is 99% accurate in ruling out NEC.243 Abubacker244 indicated via a study of 24 infants with NEC that a preoperative blood lactate level of greater than 1.6 mmol/L carries a poor prognosis with mortality odds ratio of 22 (CI 1.54 to 314.3, P = 0.04).

            "text": "\nIntestinal fatty acid\u2013binding protein (I-FABP) is a small (14 to 15 kd) cytoplasmic protein of mature enterocytes. It is released into the circulation upon death of enterocytes, thus representing intestinal injury when detected in high concentration. Lieberman,254 Edelson,255 and Guthmann256 have demonstrated an elevated level of I-FABP in the serum of neonates with NEC. Given its small size and its ability to pass through the glomerulus, urinary I-FABP has been detected as potential marker of NEC by Derikx.257 Evennett258 further characterized the release of urinary I-FABP by correlating its I-FABP-to-creatinine concentration with the severity of NEC. The I-FABP-to-creatinine concentration was significantly higher in infants with extensive disease than in those with focal disease (7.4 pg/mmol [2.1 to 35 pg/mmol] vs. 1.1 pg/mmol [0.3 to 1.7 pg/mmol], respectively, P = .002). Although studies have shown higher concentrations of I-FABP in infants with severe NEC, Thuijls259 concluded urinary I-FABP not to be an effective screening tool for NEC given its ability to identify merely one third of neonates with NEC in a group of 226 neonates with no clinical suspicion of NEC originally. This study was performed on the basis of a cutoff point of 2.20 pg/nmol creatinine derived from testing urinary I-FABP on 35 neonates suspected of NEC. However, Thuijls259 repeated the conclusion by Evennett258 that urinary I-FABP is a promising prognostic marker for NEC.",

Pneumatosis is fleeting, may appear before the onset of clinical symptoms, and is commonly an early rather than a late finding. Pneumatosis is most frequently noted when infants have been fed (84%), in contrast to unfed babies (14%).31 Pneumatosis intestinalis is not specific for NEC and has been noted in infants with enterocolitis of Hirschsprung disease, inspissated milk syndrome, pyloric stenosis, severe diarrhea, carbohydrate intolerance, and other disorders. Two forms of pneumatosis intestinalis are recognized radiographically: cystic and linear. The cystic form has a granular or foamy appearance and represents gas in the submucosa.

The genesis of portal vein gas may involve accumulation of gas in the bowel wall as a result of bacterial invasion, dissection into the venous system, and migration to the radicles of the portal vein. Alternatively, it may represent the action of gas-forming bacteria within the portal venous system itself.",

In this clinical situation, barotrauma may produce alveolar rupture with air dissection into the abdomen through the mediastinum. The patient's signs, symptoms, and laboratory findings will often differentiate the cause of the air. If one is unsure, abdominal paracentesis may be performed and any aspirated fluid analyzed.

However, overdiagnosis by contrast radiography is possible and may lead to unwarranted treatment. Careful attention to the type of contrast agent used for the study is critical.294 Barium should never be used because extravasation of a barium and stool mixture through a perforation may intensify the peritonitis. Unlike barium, water-soluble contrast agents are absorbed by both the bowel and the peritoneal cavity. The practical implication of this absorption is a transient (6 to 12 hours) increase in urinary specific gravity. Historically, water-soluble agents were hyperosmolar and caused dangerously large intraluminal fluid shifts, especially in premature patients. Current water-soluble agents are nonionic, have much lower osmolarity, and produce excellent opacification of the GI tract. NEC is suspected when intestinal contrast enhancement demonstrates bowel wall loops separated by edematous walls, an irregular mucosa with ill-defined margins, mucosal ulceration, bowel wall spiculation, or pneumatosis intestinalis. Currently, the use of contrast studies is usually reserved for interrogation of the GI tract after the acuity of NEC has resolved and in order to examine for stricture formation during or after recovery. Though advocated by some,296 contrast enemas should not be performed because of the risk for rectosigmoid perforation. Unless there is colonic disease or reflux of contrast into a diseased distal ileum, the contrast enema will not be diagnostic of NEC. It may, in fact, overdiagnose NEC because contrast enemas have been shown to produce pneumatosis and transient portal venous air. In an infant who has recently completed a course of therapy for NEC but has persistent signs of partial small bowel obstruction or blood-tinged stools, contrast enemas may be useful in identifying strictures.",

Blood and urine samples are sent for culture, and broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotic therapy is initiated. Until recently, most antibiotic regimens included a penicillin, an aminoglycoside, and an agent effective against anaerobic organisms. It seems logical that coverage for anaerobic organisms be included because these infants are usually 1 to 2 weeks old and have or are undergoing colonization by coliforms. To date, no controlled study has shown the efficacy of this regimen. The antibiotic regimen is best tailored not only to the most common organisms found with NEC but also to the nosocomial nursery flora. Because of recent reports of patients with stool and blood cultures positive for coagulase-negative staphylococci, some groups now empirically treat patients with a combination of vancomycin and gentamicin or vancomycin and a third-generation cephalosporin.301 The incidence of fungal sepsis in infants who die of NEC is high, so a strong index of suspicion must be maintained and empirical antifungal therapy should be considered if the patient's clinical course is prolonged. Historically, close clinical observation consists of frequent physical examination, two-view abdominal radiography performed every 6 to 8 hours, serum platelet and leukocyte counts, and blood gas analysis.

            "text": "Treatment of intestinal perforation in VLBW infants remains controversial. In 1977 Ein317 reported the use of peritoneal drainage (PD) as a means of stabilizing and improving the systemic status of premature infants with perforation before laparotomy. Since then, primary treatment with PD has been used in a variety of settings, and some investigators have suggested that it may serve as definitive therapy. More recently, several studies have attempted to address this issue more rigorously.318, 319, 320, 321, 322, 323, 324, 325, 326, 327, 328, 329, 330, 331, 332, 333 Currently, most surgeons propose PD as the initial treatment in ELBW infants (<1000 g at birth) with perforated NEC to allow resuscitation and stabilization before definitive laparotomy. In an attempt to address this issue, two multicenter prospective randomized controlled trials were conducted. In the NECSTEPS trial of 117 infants (<34 weeks' gestation and < 1500 g) by Moss,324 19 of 55 infants with PD died (34.5%), as compared with 22 of 62 infants with laparotomy (LAP) (35.5%, P = 0.92) by 90 days postoperatively. The percentages of infants who became dependent on total parenteral nutrition were 17 of 36 (47.2%) in the PD group and 16 of 40 (40%) in the laparotomy group (P = 0.53). Although this study was originally designed to detect a reduction in 90-day mortality from 50% to 25% with a statistical power of 82%, it failed to enroll the desired number of study subjects in the time allotted to the study, thus reducing the power to 77% or less.",

The trial found that the type of operation performed for intestinal perforation in infants with NEC (1) does not significantly affect 90-day mortality, (2) does not affect rate of dependence on total parenteral nutrition at 90 days postintervention, and (3) did not affect the total length of hospital stay. The results of this trial have led to a follow-up study that seeks to determine the difference in median to long-term outcomes comparing the two surgical procedures with an emphasis on neurodevelopmental outcomes. Two years following the publication of the NECSTEPS trial results, Rees323 published the results from the European NET trial that included 69 patients. Similar to the results in the NECSTEPS trial, there was no significant difference in the 6-month survival rate between infants undergoing either laparotomy or PD as primary treatment for perforated NEC. Six-month survival was 18 of 35 (51.4%) with PD and 21 of 33 (63.6%) with LAP (P = 0.3; Fisher exact text, difference 12%, Cl, (11, 34%). Cox regression analysis showed no significant difference between groups (hazard ratio for PD 1.6; P = 0.3; 95% CI, 0.7 to 3.4). However, in the PD group, delayed laparotomy was performed in 26 of 35 (74%) patients after a median of 2.5 days (range, 0.4 to 21) and did not improve 6-month survival compared with primary laparotomy (relative risk of mortality 1.4; P = 0.4; 95% CI, 0.6 to 3.4). Unlike the conclusion derived by the NECSTEPS trial, Rees concluded that PD is ineffective as either a temporizing measure or definitive treatment because of the high percentage of infants requiring \u201crescue\u201d laparotomy.",

The abdomen is entered via a transverse supraumbilical incision with precautions taken to not injure the liver. Optionally, samples of peritoneal fluid may be harvested for culture of aerobic, anaerobic, and fungal organisms. The entire GI tract is systematically examined to assess the extent of disease and viability of the bowel. If clear demarcation of gangrenous bowel is encountered, it is resected. Marginally viable bowel can be preserved yet defunctionalized either through a proximal diversion (enterostomy) or clip-and-drop technique wherein the intestine is closed at either end using hemoclips in an effort to prevent further passage or leakage of the fecal stream. These latter techniques are particularly useful if the overall length of involved intestine is such that the infant would be rendered \u201cshort-gut\u201d if all marginally involved intestinal length is removed. A second-look operative approach to extensive NEC involvement is currently not widely practiced. Infants tend to be quite ill with significant ongoing physiologic instability following most operative interventions for NEC.

This improvement has been attributed to earlier diagnosis and more effective supportive treatment for premature infants. Effective supportive treatment includes improved ventilatory strategies, surfactant therapy, total parenteral nutrition, improved understanding of the pathophysiology and management of critically ill newborns, and advancements in pediatric anesthesia. The increased survival has been most noticeable in infants who weigh less than 1000 g and are less than 28 weeks' gestational age. In a recent review of 754 premature infants born between 22 and 25 weeks' gestation, the overall survival rate was 63%, with a range of 14% at 22 weeks' gestation to 76% at 25 weeks' gestation.19 Mortality was still significantly higher in VLBW infants than in larger patients. This is highlighted by studies that examined the outcome of VLBW infants in comparison with \u201cstandard\u201d premature infants (>1000 g) with pan involvement NEC. Snyder345 found that infants weighing less than 1000 g are more likely to require laparotomy (51% vs. 34%) and to eventually have pan involvement (10% vs. 4%) than infants greater than 1000 g. Pan involvement was associated with 100% mortality in both groups. In a retrospective study of 70 infants weighing less than 1000 g with perforated NEC, Erhlich331 demonstrated that infant survival was independent of the type of surgical treatment (PD vs. laparotomy), but instead was inversely related to the number of comorbid conditions associated with the patient.",

Vohr357 studied the neurodevelopmental, neurosensory, and functional outcomes of 1151 ELBW (401 to 1000 g) survivors at 18 to 22 months' corrected age and reported significant deficits in neurologic development (25%), a Bayley II Mental Developmental Index less than 70 (37%), a Psychomotor Development Index less than 70 (29%), vision impairment (9%), and hearing impairment (11%). NEC was specifically associated as a risk factor for both an abnormal neurologic examination and a low Bayley Psychomotor Development Index. In a study assessing the effect of NEC on neurodevelopment, Sonntag358 compared VLBW infants with NEC with matched infants without NEC at 12 and 20 months' corrected age. Despite normal somatic growth in infants with NEC not complicated by short bowel syndrome, the authors demonstrated significant neurodevelopmental delay at both 12 and 20 months of age. Fifty-five percent of infants with NEC were noted to be severely impaired versus only 22.5% of infants without NEC. Furthermore, Hintz359,\n360 demonstrated through the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Neonatal Research Network Registry that among the ELBW infants (weight < 10th percentile for gestational age), infants with surgical intervention but not medical treatment for NEC are at significant risk for Mental Developmental Index less than 70 (OR: 1.61, 95% CI, 1.05 to 2.50), Psychomotor Developmental Index less than 70 (OR: 1.95, 95% CI, 1.25 to 3.04), and neurodevelopment impairment (OR: 1.78, 95% CI, 1.17 to 2.73) compared with infants without NEC.",

Their randomized trial involved feeding 179 high-risk infants weighing 800 to 2000 g a human preparation of IgG and IgA with their formula, whereas controls received formula alone. Neither group received breast milk. No cases of NEC developed in the immunoglobulin group, but 6 cases developed in the 91 controls.

This effect was not seen with IgG or lactoferrin. In a randomized double-blind controlled trial, enteral IgG supplementation in infants failed to reduce the incidence of NEC.363 A Cochrane review364 of three eligible trials (total of 2095 infants) on oral administration of IgG or IgG/IgA combination for preventing NEC did not yield any statistically significant reduction in the incidence of definite NEC (RR 0.84, 95% CI, 0.57 to 1.25), suspected NEC (RR 0.84, 95% CI, 0.49 to 1.46), need for surgery (RR 0.21, 95% CI, 0.02 to 1.75), or death from NEC (RR 1.10, 95% CI, 0.47 to 2.59).

This large, multicenter, placebo-controlled trial was well controlled for many potentially confounding variables. Halac14 conducted a randomized controlled trial of prenatal glucocorticoid administration to mothers in preterm labor. The control mothers received placebos, but their infants received an immediate postnatal course of high-dose dexamethasone for 7 days. The rate of NEC within and between groups significantly decreased after prenatal and postnatal steroid treatment. Although postnatal therapy did not decrease the incidence as effectively as prenatal therapy did, it improved the clinical outcome of NEC; however, many potentially confounding factors were not assessed in this study. Confirmatory prospective data and assessment of potential postnatal toxicity are necessary. In a double-blind randomized controlled trial comparing perinatal morbidities between antenatal betamethasone and dexamethasone (299 women),369 no significant differences were observed to exist in the incidence of NEC (0 of 181 for betamethasone, 2 of 178 for dexamethasone). Furthermore, another multicenter randomized controlled trial370 of 502 pregnant women demonstrated no difference in the incidence of NEC between weekly administration and a single course of antenatal corticosteroids (RR 1.06, 95% CI, 0.44 to 2.56, P value = 0.90).",

There has been increasing interest in using probiotics for the prevention of NEC. Probiotic microorganisms commonly used are strains of Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, Streptococcus salivarius, and Saccharomyces boulardii. Multiple randomized, controlled trials have attempted to address this issue, and several meta-analyses have been published. The most recent meta-analysis by Deshpande384 analyzed 11 trials385, 386, 387, 388, 389, 390, 391, 392, 393, 394, 395 (n = 2176) in which enteral probiotic supplementation was started within the first 10 days and continued for 7 or more days in VLBW neonates (<1500 g). Compared with the control group of no probiotics, significant reductions of risk were noted for developing definite NEC (RR 0.35, 95% CI, 0.23 to 0.55, P < 0.00001) and dying from all causes (RR 0.42, 95% CI, 0.29 to 0.62, P < 0.00001). Further sensitivity analysis, examination through the funnel plot, and trial series analysis supported a 30% reduction in the incidence of NEC (alpha = 0.05; power of 80%). However, risks for sepsis, death from NEC, and longer time to full feed (120 to 150 mL/kg per day enteral feeds or as per the prestated definitions by authors) did not differ significantly between both groups after adjustments were made for heterogeneity via a random-effects model.",

The use of an enteral aminoglycoside (e.g., kanamycin or gentamicin) has been proposed as a means to decrease the incidence of perforation during nonoperative treatment. However, randomized, controlled studies found no difference in the clinical course, complications, or mortality rate between infants who received the antibiotic and those who did not.404,\n405 In addition, oral aminoglycosides may be absorbed across the damaged gut, which can lead to increased serum levels and thereby potentially contribute to drug toxicity. Resistant strains of bacteria emerged after treatment with enteral kanamycin,404 and there is the omnipresent risk for promotion of the growth of fungal species. In a recent randomized placebo-controlled study of oral vancomycin in preventing NEC in preterm infants, Siu16 reported a 50% reduction in the incidence of NEC in the vancomycin group in comparison with controls. A meta-analysis of five trials (n = 456) by Bury406 suggested that prophylactic enteral antibiotics resulted in a statistically significant reduction in NEC (RR 0.47 [0.28, 0.78]; RD -0.10 [-0.16, -0.04]; NNT 10 [6, 25]) and in NEC-related deaths (RR 0.32 [0.10, 0.96]; RD -0.07 [-0.13, 0.01]; NNT 14 [8, 100]). However, the summary analysis of three trials gave an increase in the incidence of colonization with resistant bacteria that was just significant (RR 1.73 [1.00, 2.97]; RD 0.07 [0.00, 0.13]). Furthermore, a subsequent retrospective cohort analysis of 5693 neonates (<1000 g) from the NICHD database by Cotton407 demonstrated that for every antibiotic treatment day, there was at least a 4% increase in the odds of an infant having NEC or dying, especially when antibiotics were initiated in the first 3 postnatal days for 5 or more days of treatment.",
