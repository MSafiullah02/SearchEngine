A scale-free network has been adopted for modeling on-line communities so far but is employed here for the aim to represent peoples' social behaviors where the generated communities are restricted reflecting the spatiotemporal constraints in the real life. As a result, three findings and a policy proposal have been obtained. First, the height of the peaks in the time sequence of the number of infection cases tends to get reduced corresponding to the upper bound of the size of groups where all members meet.",

Third, such a moderate constraint may temporarily seem to work for the reduction of infections in the early stage but it may turn out to be just a delay of peaks. Based on these results, a policy is proposed here: for quickly suppressing the number of infections, restrict W to less than 4 if the constraint to make m0 at most 1 is too strict. If W is set to less than 4, setting m0 to 4 or less works for quick reduction of infections according to the result.",

For example, it has been found that the cascades in skewed human networks are triggered by large degree nodes, whereas small degree nodes may trigger cascade other networks [6] . We can find models for other social phenomena than virus spreading. In [7] , the diffusion of innovation has been simulated in artificial social networks and found the delayed propagation to lowdegree nodes from high-degree nodes, which is of greater impact if informative and nominal contacts from neighboring nodes are mixed. Although this study is not applied for virus infection events, we find the authors' interest in the mutual influence between highdegree nodes and low-degree nodes in which the role of the latter is coming to be focused. This interest differs from the interest in tail-fat networks or from the detection of lowfrequency influential nodes. Further, an encouraging fact is that the authors of [2] , [7] , and others having been working on network dynamics are contributing to providing points to consider in designing policies for controlling epidemic spreading [8] .",

If so, what should the governmental policy be like? In this paper, we show a quick report based on a simple simulation of infection spreading in a social network of people in an urban environment. In this environment, people get interested in attending a place where a lot of others are attracted. This interest may not be directed to any particular people in the place, but to something that may be an object shown in the place or the atmospheric mood. In this place, a new member may come close to other humans, touch objects implemented in the place, and breathe the air in the place. These behaviors of people are similar to the social dynamics known to form a scale-free network [9] where new nodes get connected to highdegree nodes. However, there are real-space constraints on the dynamics that are 1: the restriction of space (the upper bound on the number of people to meet at a time), and 2: the restriction of time (the number of other people to meet if one may meet just one other at a time). In this paper, we aim to find some clues to discuss the question above by simple simulations using a constrained scale-free network reflecting the two kinds of restrictions.",

Networks such as WWW and online communities [10] , cellular networks in biology [11] , patients of sexually transmitted diseases [12] , etc. have been known to for SFN following the power-law degree distribution. We basically regard the generation process above of SFN as a model capturing real social behaviors of people approximately, comparing with other existing models. For example, all the nodes are connected to the same number of edges in a regular graph, which is inconsistent with the real inequality of peoples' social activities in the real world. The small-world networks on the WS (Watts-Strgats) model start from a regular graph and move a certain number of randomly selected edges connected from each node, that we humans do not do in the daily activities [13] . In the more recently proposed Mediation-Driven Attachment Model [14, 15] , each new node first picks an existing node at random and connects not directly with this but with a certain number of its neighbors also picked at random. This is an extension of SFN supposed to result in having each new node connected to \"rich\" people linked to a large number of \"poor\" people of low degrees by choosing link destination nodes by the probability estimated to be inverse of the harmonic mean (IHM). Although this may make the network fit to the real society, we do not choose as the model for this paper because the attendants of places do not have a bias to lowdegree nodes in the daily life human behaviors. Thus, considering the suitability of each model to the intuitive understanding of the social life of people, we take SFN as the backbone and revise it with introducing constraints corresponding to the spatiotemporal restrictions in the real life of people as in the next section. Reference [12] above encourages this choice in the sense a virus infection network has been shown to follow the power-law distribution.",

If the node comes to be more popular than having W links, the node is removed as in line 12. This means the room or space of capacity of W or larger is forbidden as in the protection of COVID-19 infection spreading. However, to add allowed groups of up to the capacity of W attendants by a certain frequency considering the load of the group-meeting organizer, we add the lines 16 and 17 where some nodes get larger preference than others when a new node explores link destinations (*3). \uf061 is a constant set to 5.

This lack in immunity is supposed to occur in the sparsely connected parts of the entire graph G because people on the nodes in such parts are of lower degree and fewer opportunities to touch others. If there are large meeting groups in such a case, the hypothesis goes that the infections in these groups attack the nonimmune part of the network. However, if m0 is constrained further to 1, according to Table 1 , the risk is reduced because the casting and catching of viruses occur in lower",

This tendency is found in the similar range of W and m0 to the second finding in Section 3 where the number of infection cases was simulated, so we can assume that a policy of restriction on W and m0 that reduces the number of infections can also quicken the reduction.

A moderate constraint where m0 ranges in 2 \u2264 0 \u2264 8 may temporarily seem to work for the reduction of infections in the early stage within 30 weeks from the beginning. However, this does not mean the uptrend really disappears but may be just delayed to a later period. As in Figure   1 and 2, the increase in the number of new infection cases for smaller m0 continues for all the 30 weeks, which is a period that covers the entire hills (i.e., both the uptrend and the downtrend) of new infection cases for the larger m0. In Figure 3 , showing 100 weeks in the conditions of smaller m0, we find the slow increase for the first 30 weeks in each condition shown in Figures 1 and 2 was really a part of a long-lasting increase.

The first finding above is refined based on these contours. That is, zone A in Figure 4 meaning the quickest suppression of new infection cases for both N = 1000 and 10000, is given by restricting both W and m0 to the low-value ranges. Thus, the restriction of W in the first finding is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for the quick suppression.
