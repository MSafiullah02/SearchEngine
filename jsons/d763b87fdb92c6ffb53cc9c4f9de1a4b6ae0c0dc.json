Functional proteins contained in animal plasma are responsible for the beneficial effects, and spray drying is a rapid heating process necessary for conserving the biological activity of these proteins (Torrallardona, 2010) . However, there is a risk of disease transmission when feeding improperly processed porcine-derived tissues to pigs, and feeding SDPP was associated with transmission of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDv) to nursery pigs (Pasick et al., 2014) . This risk appears to be relatively ABSTRACT: Ultraviolet light irradiation of spray-dried porcine plasma (SDPP) decreases the risk of disease transmission, but it may decrease the activity of bioactive components in SDPP. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to determine growth performance, morbidity, and mortality responses of nursery pigs fed UV-irradiated SDPP (UV-SDPP) compared with nonirradiated spray-dried bovine plasma (SDBP). Pigs (n = 480; 6.09 \u00b1 2.4 kg initial BW) were blocked by initial BW, and blocks were assigned to pens. the sex ratio was equalized within blocks and pens. Pens were randomly assigned to 1 of 5 dietary treatments (8 pigs/pen and 12 replicates/treatment) in a 3-phase feeding program (phase 1 = d 0 to 13, phase 2 = d 14 to 27, and phase 3 = d 28 to 55). Dietary treatments included a control diet without UV-SDPP or SDBP and diets containing 3% UV-SDPP, 3% SDBP, 6% UV-SDPP, or 6% SDBP during phase 1. Diets were formulated to meet or exceed nutrient requirements and contained the same concentrations of standardized ileal digestible Lys and Lys:ME ratio within phases. Pigs were provided ad libitum access to diets throughout the 55-d experiment. Dietary inclusion rates during phase 2 were reduced to 1.5% UV-SDPP, 1.5% SDBP, 3% UV-SDPP, and 3% SDBP, and all pigs were fed a common diet without UV-SDPP or SDBP during phase 3. Growth performance data were analyzed as a 2 \u00d7 2 factorial arrangement of treatments with a control within a completely randomized block design to evaluate the main effects of plasma processing (UV irradiated vs. nonirradiated) and dietary inclusion level, and block, room, and pen were random effects. In phase 1, there were no differences in G:F among treatments, but pigs fed 6% UV-SDPP and 6% SDBP had greater (P < 0.01) ADG (0.11 vs. 0.08 kg/d) and ADFI (0.17 vs. 0.15 kg/d) than pigs fed the control, 3% SDBP, and 3% UV-SDPP diets. After phase 1 (d13), feeding UV-SDPP or SDBP increased (P = 0.02) the BW of pigs. In phases 2 and 3 and the overall feeding period (d 0 to 55), there were no differences in ADG, ADFI, and G:F among dietary treatments. There was a linear decrease (P < 0.01) in mortality of nursery pigs as dietary inclusion rate of SDBP and UV-SDPP increased. In conclusion, feeding SDBP or UV-SDPP diets improved ADG and ADFI during the first 2 wk after weaning due to improved feed consumption, and UV irradiation appeared to have no detrimental effects on the feeding value of SDPP. low because spray drying inactivates porcine circovirus (Pujols et al., 2008 (Pujols et al., , 2011 Shen et al., 2011) and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (Polo et al., 2005) . Likewise, spray drying appears to inactivate PEDv (Gerber et al., 2014; Pujols and Segal\u00e9s, 2014) .

Therefore, feeding trials testing interventions to mitigate negative impact of disease challenge are not suitable to make inferences Table 5 . Effects of feeding diets with spray-dried bovine plasma (SDBP) and UV-irradiated spray-dried porcine plasma (UV-SDPP) on morbidity and pen final weight of nursery pigs on the effectiveness of the intervention in growth of pigs in commercial facilities. However, our observations suggest that the unsanitary housing conditions used in our research facilities was effective, potentially generating a greater environmental microbial load, which appeared to provide a disease challenge more than that observed on commercial farms in the U.S. pork industry because the mortality rate was greater than the 5% reported for most farms (NPB, 2015) . Therefore, it is possible to infer that pigs fed under commercial conditions would also respond in magnitude similar to the improvements in growth performance and reductions in mortality that were observed in this experiment from feeding UV-SDPP or SDBP diets (Torrallardona, 2010; Pujols et al., 2016) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 411, "end": 438, "text": "(Coffey and Cromwell, 1995)", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1211, "end": 1222, "text": "(NPB, 2015)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1485, "end": 1506, "text": "(Torrallardona, 2010;", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 1507, "end": 1527, "text": "Pujols et al., 2016)", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 574, "end": 581, "text": "Table 5", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Morbidity and Mortality"}, {"text": "The results of the current experiment demonstrate that UV-SDPP was effective in sustaining ADFI and ADG of nursery pigs in the first week after weaning in a magnitude comparable to the literature and suggests that commercial UV irradiation of porcine plasma is not detrimental to the functional proteins contained in this high-protein ingredient similar to other proteins (Choudhary and Bandla, 2012; Christen et al., 2013) . Also, the fact that growth of pigs fed UV-SDPP was similar to that of pigs fed SDBP suggests that there are no detrimental effects of feeding pigs diets or feed ingredients that were UV irradiated and that UV irradiation is a process useful to decrease pathogens in spraydried plasma. This is consistent with other studies that demonstrated that feeding \u03b3-irradiated complete diets is not detrimental to growth performance of nursery pigs (DeRouchey et al., 2001 (DeRouchey et al., , 2003a Keegan et al., 2003) . It is worth mentioning that UV irradiation inactivates the virus but it does not destroy the genomic material. The manufacturing lot of UV-SDPP used in the feed for this study contained PEDV genome confirmed by a PCR (Ct = 32). Likewise, samples of phase 1 diets containing the UV-SDPP (stored at \u221220\u00b0C and analyzed 1 yr after production) had detectable PEDv genome (>40 in the CON, >40 in 3% SDBP, 35 in3% UV-SDPP, >40 in 6% SDBP, and 36 in 6% UV-SDPP). The increase in Ct values between the ingredient and final diets may be due to the dilution of the virus genome in the final feed after blending and to genome degradation during storage conditions (12 mo at \u221220\u00b0C). These observations suggest that UV irradiation does not render PEDv genomic material undetectable but confirms that genomic material in SDPP was not infectious and indicates a need for developing more accurate and sensitive diagnostic methods to detect PEDv and other viruses in feed ingredients to determine their relative risk of transmission via this route (Sampedro et al., 2016) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 372, "end": 400, "text": "(Choudhary and Bandla, 2012;", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 401, "end": 423, "text": "Christen et al., 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 865, "end": 888, "text": "(DeRouchey et al., 2001", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 889, "end": 915, "text": "(DeRouchey et al., , 2003a", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 916, "end": 936, "text": "Keegan et al., 2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1969, "end": 1992, "text": "(Sampedro et al., 2016)", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Morbidity and Mortality"}, {"text": "In conclusion, the addition of 6% spray-dried plasma (bovine or porcine) in phase 1 diets improves growth performance of nursery pigs, especially when pigs are under stressful situations such as a nonspecific disease challenge. The benefits are observed not only on improvement in growth early in the nursery period but also on decrease in mortality. Porcine plasma that was UV irradiated at a commercial facility was as effective as nonirradiated bovine plasma in improving feed intake of nursery pigs during the first week after weaning. Therefore, UV irradiation on a commercial scale does not appear to negatively affect the nutritional or functional properties of spray-dried porcine plasma. Figure 1 .
