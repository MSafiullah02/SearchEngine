            "text": "Outbreaks of diarrhea in newborn piglets occurred on a pig farm in Guangdong province of southern China in February 2017 (Gong et al., 2017). At that time, several pathogens were tested for these cases of diarrhea, including enteric coronaviruses porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV), porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV). However, all samples were negative for the presence of these three pathogens (Pan et al., 2017). In September 2017, a novel swine enteric alphacoronavirus (SeACoV) also named as bat-HKU2\u2013like porcine coronavirus (PEAV) or swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV) was identified in southern China (Gong et al., 2017; Pan et al., 2017; Zhou et al., 2018a, Zhou et al., 2018b). The mortality rate was more than 35% in swine that were less than 10 days old and caused serious economic losses to the swine industry (Pan et al., 2017). All affected pigs showed acute vomiting and severe watery diarrhea, similar to clinical signs caused by PEDV, TGEV and PDCoV. A reliable and simple diagnostic method for the surveillance of SADS-CoV was needed to distinguish between these viral pathogens.",

This disease has already caused huge economic losses in the Chinese swine industry. However, its detection was problematic since the disease symptoms are similar to other viruses (Jung et al., 2016; Pensaert and de Bouck, 1978; Stevenson et al., 2013). Although a TaqMan-based real-time RT-PCR assay had already been developed for SADS-CoV, this method required expensive equipment and supplies. Therefore, a simple and rapid method was needed for field studies of SADS-CoV infections. In this study, a real-time RT-LAMP assay was successfully developed using SADS-CoV N gene specific primers. The assay is suitable for SADS-CoV detection in less well-equipped laboratories.",

In the present study, the real-time RT-LAMP method was used to detect SADS-CoV and did not cross-react with other porcine pathogens. SADS-CoV N gene was specifically amplified with a detection limit of 1.0 \u00d7 101 copies/\u03bcL and had good reproducibility. The sensitivity of the LAMP assay is similar to real-time RT-PCR (Yu et al., 2015). In this study, the RT-LAMP correctly identified 20 out of 24 samples as positive, showing similar diagnostic sensitivity comparable to the real time RT-PCR. Together our data indicates that the real-time RT-LAMP assay was accurate and sensitive.",
