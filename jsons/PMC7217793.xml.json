It is characterised by a dissociation between relatively well-preserved lung mechanics and the severity of hypoxemia.[1] A possible explanation for the severe hypoxemia occurring in compliant lungs, is the loss of lung perfusion regulation and hypoxic vasoconstriction. Coagulation dysfunction also appears to be common in severe COVID-19,[2], [3] with fatal cases exhibiting diffuse microvascular thrombosis, suggesting a thrombogenic microangiopathy.[4]\n",

Replication of virus within the host cell can cause direct cellular damage and release of pro-inflammatory signals. Angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) consumption by viral entry would be predicted to increase local angiotensin-II concentration, contributing to vasoconstriction, endothelial activation, and pro-inflammatory cytokine release \u2013 inducing further alveolar epithelial and vascular endothelial cell damage.[2], [3] Endothelial cell involvement may then spread across vascular beds of different organs.[4]\n",

However, BAME groups have a disproportionally high prevalence of T2D [17] and disparities have been observed in diabetes control, monitoring and presence of microvascular complications in the BAME, compared to white population.[18] In this context, dysglycaemia (both HbA1c and mean glucose) associating with adverse outcomes in COVID-19, may be surrogates for the presence and severity of underlying microvascular disease.[6] The prevalence of prediabetes among adults is approximately 38% and 35%, in the United States[17] and United Kingdom[19] respectively. Prediabetes is also over-represented in BAME population. In the UK, the hazard ratio for prediabetes in South Asians was 1.67 (1.12 to 2.50) and for Blacks 1.45 (0.92 to 2.27), compared to the white population.[19] Although it is alluring to think that people with prediabetes are protected from microvascular disease; early stages of retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy have been reported in people with prediabetes, with a prevalence of up to 10%.[10], [20]\n",
