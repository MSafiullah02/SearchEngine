            "text": "The number of viral outbreaks has increased dramatically in recent years. Since 1996, the world has seen at least one major outbreak of a new virus or of a new variant of a known virus each year. Vaccines are hardly capable of stopping such outbreaks, because even with advances in their development, they will not be available for 6 to 12 months following the first appearance of a new pathogen. Immediate containment of viral outbreaks will therefore depend on quarantine and antiviral drugs. Unfortunately, no drug treatment is available for most known viral diseases of humans, let alone for newly emerging ones. We believe that in view of this situation, it is necessary to develop lead compounds with activity against all major families of viruses, both those that infect humans and those that so far have been restricted to animals but may cross the species barrier by zoonotic transmission. Ultimately, we should aim at discovering antiviral compounds that exhibit a relatively broad activity against a range of new viruses should they emerge.",

Random screening for antivirals may have its merits, but the case of HIV has demonstrated that this approach has not led to a single marketed drug in the past 20 years, whereas no fewer than 26 antiretroviral drugs that have been rationally designed are on the market or in late development phases. Therefore, we follow a structure-based approach to discover new compounds with activity against RNA viruses. Methods applied include de-novo design, virtual screening, and structure-guided medicinal chemistry, all of which require a detailed knowledge of the structure and function of the viral target enzymes.",

The human coronavirus NL63, first described in March 2004, has been identified as the causative agent of respiratory disease in very young children and in immunocompromised adults (2). Furthermore, HCoV-NL63 infection has been associated with laryngotracheitis (croup) (3) and Kawasaki disease, although the latter has been contested by a recent study (4).",

            "text": "The 16 nonstructural proteins (Nsp) of the coronaviruses are required for genomic RNA synthesis (replication) and subgenomic RNA synthesis (transcription). They are encoded by the replicase gene, which comprises two open reading frames, ORF1a and ORF1b. ORF1a encodes the replicative polyprotein 1a (pp1a). The larger pp1ab results from a (\u20131) ribosomal frameshift during translation, which occurs just upstream of the ORF1a stop codon. Thus, pp1ab is the translation product of ORF1a with a large extension resulting from the ORF1b-encoded part. The polyproteins are processed into individual polypeptides by the virus-encoded proteases, one or two papain-like cysteine proteases (domains of Nsp3) and the main protease (Nsp5). Even though the function of a few nonstructural proteins is known, e.g., Nsp5 being the main protease, Nsp13 being a helicase and Nsp12 being an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (1,5), the process of replication and transcription has not yet been elucidated. It is expected that this problem will be tackled by structural and functional studies of individual nonstructural proteins and of the complexes they form with one another and with nucleic acids.",

Today, more than 85% of protein structures are elucidated by X-ray crystallography. For crystallization, rather elevated concentrations of the protein under study are needed (5\u201320 mg/ml) and the sample should be as pure as possible (>95%). To achieve this, an efficient expression system and a reliable purification protocol have to be established. Here we present a few protocols for expression in Escherichia coli of genes coding for nonstructural proteins of human coronaviruses NL63 and 229E and for increasing the solubility of the recombinant protein. We also describe the purification of proteins carrying hexahistidine or GST (glutathione-S transferase) affinity tags. Furthermore, we present a preliminary crystallization experiment that has been shown to give initial hints at crystallization conditions.",

            "text": "\nAll buffers should be filtered through a 0.45-\u03bcm filter and stored at 4\u00b0C to decrease the risk of contamination.The buffers for the His-tagged protein are chosen according to the literature (6). These buffers vary in composition (salts, additives) and pH stabilizing the protein and/or improving solubility.According to the GST Gene Fusion System Handbook (Amersham Biosciences), PBS is used as a buffer for purification of the fusion protein. Additives are selected with properties of the protein in mind, i.e., isoelectric point, hydropathy, etc.The buffer that gave the best result in the solubility screen (Section 3.4) is the basic buffer. Thus, the binding buffer contains the basic buffer plus 20 mM imidazole and the elution buffer consists of the basic buffer plus 500 mM imidazole. The basic buffer resulting from the solubility screen should be compatible with the Ni2+ sepharose, e.g., it should not contain EDTA, as this would strip the Ni2+ from the column.The buffer used here for cell lysis is the 1 \u00d7PBS buffer, containing the additive that gave the best result in the solubility screen (Section 3.4).The calculated amounts of the substances for the stock solutions are dissolved in distilled water and filtered through a 0.45-\u03bcm filter. For solutions that cannot be filtered because of high viscosity, e.g., the 50% PEG 6000 solution, the powder can be dissolved in prefiltered distilled water. The pH of the buffers is adjusted to the desired pH with NaOH or HCl.In the case of Nsp8 of HCoV 229E, the FoldIndex\u00a9 program (7) predicts an unfolded region at the N terminus of the protein (Fig.\n1). Actually, this part is involved in the interaction with Nsp7, as revealed by the crystal structure of the Nsp7:Nsp8 complex of SARS-CoV (8).Be sure that the gel gets polymerized; otherwise artifact bands will be observed when the protein is subjected to gel electrophoresis.Depending on the protein, heating and mercaptoethanol reduction may influence the electrophoretic mobility. If the observed molecular mass differs from the one expected from the polypeptide sequence, other temperature conditions should be tried. SDS-PAGE under nonreducing, compared to reducing, conditions gives a hint concerning disulfide bonds present in the protein, as shown in Fig.\n2.During the cell lysis under denaturing conditions, the cells are totally destroyed and the proteins are unfolded. Thus, this sample represents the positive control on an SDS-PAGE gel, displaying the total amount of proteins in the cell.The overnight culture is done to have an optimal growth of the cells. After the overnight incubation, the cells are adapted to the medium and strong enough to be transferred into a larger volume of medium. If the colony from the agar plate is directly transferred to a larger volume, it takes a longer time until the cells reach the desired cell density and by then the risk of contamination increases.The decision as to whether to pick a single colony or a mixture of colonies depends on the stability of the clones. Using a mixture of colonies can increase the chance of finding an expression clone. In the same way, it can increase the risk of a failed expression, as the cells can contain damaged plasmids. Thus, several single colonies have to be analyzed individually. Nevertheless, checking out ten single colonies can result in no expression, whereas one or two mixtures of colonies may include good expression clones.It is not absolutely necessary to centrifuge the overnight culture in order to remove degraded ampicillin and expressed \u03b2-lactamase, as the volume of the overnight culture is really small.To go for a higher expression rate, additional parameters can be tested, e.g., different E. coli strains [BL21(DE3), Tuner pLacI (DE3), C41 (DE3)] and media (Luria Bertani, rich medium), as well as different incubation times.From comparison with the intensity of the host proteins, the amount of the target protein produced can be estimated. Weak bands of the heterologously produced protein in a high background of E. coli proteins are difficult to detect. In any case, correct expression has to be confirmed by Western blot methods (works well for crude lysates, if the protein of interest shows up with a high yield), N-terminal sequencing, and mass spectrometry analysis (for purified recombinant protein).Unlike cultivation for the expression analysis (Section 3.3.2), it is recommended to centrifuge the overnight culture to remove the degraded ampicillin and the expressed \u03b2-lactamase to avoid contamination during cultivation.The expression parameters, such as induction time (OD660), amount of inducer, and duration of the expression, are adjusted to the results from the initial cultivation (see Section 3.3.2). Our example is from cultures I and II, shown in Fig.\n3.\nEven if a better expression condition is found at 20\u00b0C, a cultivation should also be performed at 37\u00b0C, in order to test whether the protein produced in lower yields is more soluble than the one obtained in higher amounts.Starting from the first step, everything should be done on ice and at 4\u00b0C to avoid protein degradation. In addition, the use of protease inhibitors, for instance, complete protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche), may be advisable.Sometimes much effort can be invested in finding a buffer for cell lysis to obtain soluble protein. Depending on the function of the viral protein in replication or transcription, it may need another nonstructural protein to form a complex for proper folding. Figure\n6 demonstrates the independent purifications of Nsp7 and Nsp8 from HCoV 229E. Whereas Nsp7 is soluble, Nsp8 is not. However, by combining the pellets and purifying the two together, the solubility of Nsp8 increases dramatically as shown in Fig.\n7. Recently, the crystal structure of a hexadecameric (8:8) Nsp7:Nsp8 complex from the SARS coronavirus has been determined (8).\n\n\nOnce the expression and cell-lysis conditions have been optimized to yield large amounts of soluble protein, biochemical and structural studies can be started. The protein is purified from a 1-liter cultivation (according to Section 3.3.3., with the necessary adjustments for the larger cultivation volume) using affinity chromatography: (i) Affinity Chromatography: Principle and Methods Handbook; (ii) GST Gene Fusion System Handbook: Amersham Biosciences). This can be followed by ion-exchange or size-exclusion chromatography to remove more impurities.French press is just one possibility for breaking the cells. Sonication or several thaw/freeze cycles can also be done for cell disruption.Instead of a peristaltic pump, an automatic device can be used as well. For instance, the \u00c4kta Prime (Amersham Biosciences) is easy to use for simple purification of proteins on a laboratory scale.If the purification can be done with automated equipment instead of a step gradient, the protein can be eluted using a linear gradient. This gradient may separate proteins with similar binding strengths.It depends on the purity of the eluted protein whether the dialysis can be done directly afterward or if a second purification step (ion-exchange or size-exclusion chromatography) is advisable to remove more impurities. Experience shows that sometimes only the purest fraction will give high-quality crystals; therefore, inclusion of too much of the flanks of the protein peak should be avoided.For concentrating the protein solution, methods other than ultrafiltration can be used, depending on what is established in the laboratory.In the protocol given here, the GST fusion protein contains a cleavage site for PreScission\u2122 protease. Other fusion constructs may require different proteases (e.g., factor Xa) for processing. In the example described here, the protein of interest is cleaved off from the GST fusion by the PreScission\u2122 protease directly on the column. It is also possible to do the cleavage in a reaction tube after elution of the GST fusion protein with the elution buffer. The fractions containing the GST fusion protein are pooled and dialyzed against the cleavage buffer before starting the cleavage. After overnight incubation, the solution is applied onto the GSTrap\u2122 5-ml column and washed with cleavage buffer. The flow-through contains the protein. Furthermore, cleavage of the fusion protein is not always required. A number of target-fusion crystal structures have been reported. In some cases, fusion proteins can be useful tools for crystallization (9,10).In addition to the mentioned preliminary crystallization experiment with ammonium sulfate and PEG 6000 other precipitants can be tested as well, for instance, sodium chloride and 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol (MPD) (11). There are commercial crystallization kits available. Sigma-Aldrich offers crystallization kits (basic and extension) for proteins that are based on the original screening protocol of Jancarik and Kim (12), which utilizes crystallization conditions that have worked before for various proteins and allows testing of a large range of buffers, pH, additives, and precipitants. The protocol can be used for setting up the crystallization experiment by hand, or alternatively, by pipetting robots that allow screening of a larger number of possible crystallization conditions (high-throughput experiment) with less volume of the protein solution and less effort.Temperature also has an influence on the crystallization of the protein. If there is enough protein solution available, other temperatures such as 4\u00b0C, 25\u00b0C, or 37\u00b0C should be tested.Figure8 shows crystals of the HCoV-NL63 Nsp3 X-domain obtained from the preliminary crystallization experiment (Section 3.6). A solution containing 1 \u03bcl protein (7 mg/ml) and 1 \u03bcl reservoir solution was equilibrated against 250 \u03bcl reservoir solution of well B7 (20% PEG 6000, 0.1 M citric acid pH 5.0). The crystal diffracted to 3.5 \u00c5 resolution. Within this screen, crystals could be obtained if PEG 6000 (10\u201320%) was used as precipitant in a range of pH 7.0 to 9.0, whereas (NH4)2SO4 had no effect on the crystallization of the protein. The reservoir solution has been optimized and crystals have been grown that diffract to 1.8 \u00c5 resolution. Optimization of the crystallization conditions can also include additives such as 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol (MPD). Figure9 shows intergrown crystals of Nsp9 of HCoV 229E and a single crystal grown in the presence of 5% MPD. Keep in mind, that each component of the reservoir solution can either promote or hinder the crystallization experiment. So, the choice of the buffer, salts, or organic additives should be very carefully considered and investigated (13).\n\n",
