In the example (a) in Fig. 1 , we have a named entity (\"Borneo\"/LOC) which is not part of an in-text reference.

The morphological complexity is inversely proportional of the understanding of the reference out of context, i.e., independently of the bibliography provided at the end of the article. Numeric references have no significance out of context, because the cited work cannot be identified without the bibliography. Alphanumeric references can be understood, according to their form, by researchers in the same field of study or more broadly in the same discipline.

The Introduction section, which is also the shortest one on average, contains the highest number of citations. This table shows also that MIR appear very often: in around 41% of all sentences containing in-text references. This means that in a scientific article, the largest number of in-text references appears in groups of several references situated closely in the textual space, i.e., in the same sentence. Table 2 presents the percentage of sentences with MIR of different sizes among all sentences containing citations in each of the four section types.

Then, the differences between the sections increase with the number in in-text references. This means that, while MIR with 2 elements appear almost homogeneously in an article, the MIR with higher number of elements are more and more exclusively reserved to the Introduction section.

The higher frequencies for the top ten patterns around SIR mean that the contexts in which SIR appear are less diverse compared to the contexts of MIR in terms of syntactic structure. We observe the same specificity of the Methods section: the contexts of SIR in this section contain most often verb forms (VBD, VBN, VBG) and adverbs (RB). In particular, the most frequent pattern in the Methods section is VBD VBN IN RB VBN < xref > and it accounts for 1.66% of all occurrences of SIR in this section. This same pattern is also the most frequent in the case of MIR (with frequency 0.40%). Examples of such sentence are: [22] . 6 Analysis of binding antibodies against whole SARS-CoV lysates or N protein, and S glycoprotein-specific neutralizing antibody (Nab) were/VBD conducted/VBN as/IN previously/RB reported/VBN [11] . 7 Further, we examined how the number of in-text references in the sentences impacts the syntactic structure of the contexts. Table 8 presents the top 10 most frequent syntactic patterns depending on the number of in-text references in the sentence. The frequency of each pattern is given as a percentage of all patterns occurring around the same number of in-text references.

In our experiment, we considered both the left and right contexts around the in-text references. However, only the left contexts appear among the top 10 most frequent contexts.

Furthermore, many applications can benefit from the differentiation between single and multiple references such as automatic summarization [11, 21] or automatic generation of surveys [20] . More generally, the distribution of MIR along the text progression has important implications for understanding the contexts of citations. For example, we can consider the following sentence: In this sentence, there are 3 aggregates of in-text references and each aggregate is characterized by a noun group that identifies topics related to the references.

By studying a largescale corpus of about 80,000 articles published by PLOS, we show the following key points: -MIR are rather frequent in all sections of articles: 41% of the sentences with citations contain MIR. -In the Introduction section, MIR account for more than half of the sentences containing citations. -The MIR with two elements are the most homogeneous: they appear quite often in the Introduction, Results and Discussion sections (about 20% of sentences with citations) and in about 15% of sentences with citations in the Methods section. -There exist sentences with very high number of in-text citations (more than 100). Such sentences are specific to the domain of medicine and the systematic review article type. -SIR and MIR appear for the most part at the end of the sentences. -In the Methods section, SIR and MIR are most often part of the verb group in the sentence, while in the other sections they are surrounded by noun groups. -MIR are most likely to occur near verb groups in sentences containing few in-text references (N \u2264 5) and in the Methods section.", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF6": {"text": "Previous attempts to apply functional genomics methods to address these questions used various approaches, including DNA microarrays (Hayward et al. 2000; Ben Mamoun et al. 2001; Le Roch et al. 2002), serial analysis of gene expression (Patankar et al. 2001), and mass spectrometry (Florens et al. 2002; Lasonder et al. 2002) on a limited number of samples from different developmental stages.8", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "TABREF0": {"text": "MIR in the IMRaD Structure", "latex": null, "type": "table", "html": "<html><body><table><tr><td>\u00a0</td><td>I (%) </td><td>M (%) </td><td>R (%) </td><td>D (%) </td><td>Total (%)\n</td></tr><tr><td>Sentences with\n</td><td>52.78 </td><td>25.05 </td><td>35.59 </td><td>42.65 </td><td>41.43\n</td></tr><tr><td>MIR\n</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td></tr><tr><td>Sentences with a single reference\n</td><td>47.22 </td><td>74.95 </td><td>64.41 </td><td>57.35 </td><td>58.57\n</td></tr></table></body></html>"}, "TABREF1": {"text": "Percentage of sentences with MIR in the IMRaD structure", "latex": null, "type": "table", "html": "<html><body><table><tr><td>Number of in-text references in MIR\n</td><td>I (%) </td><td>M (%) </td><td>R (%) </td><td>D (%)\n</td></tr><tr><td>2 </td><td>21.74 </td><td>15.67 </td><td>19.49 </td><td>20.74\n</td></tr><tr><td>3 </td><td>11.63 </td><td>4.43 </td><td>7.31 </td><td>9.34\n</td></tr><tr><td>4 </td><td>6.25 </td><td>1.53 </td><td>3.05 </td><td>4.36\n</td></tr><tr><td>5 </td><td>3.45 </td><td>0.68 </td><td>1.39 </td><td>2.12\n</td></tr><tr><td>6 </td><td>2.04 </td><td>0.34 </td><td>0.70 </td><td>1.13\n</td></tr><tr><td>7 </td><td>1.22 </td><td>0.17 </td><td>0.39 </td><td>0.64\n</td></tr><tr><td>8 </td><td>0.77 </td><td>0.10 </td><td>0.23 </td><td>0.36\n</td></tr><tr><td>9 </td><td>0.48 </td><td>0.06 </td><td>0.14 </td><td>0.21\n</td></tr><tr><td>10 </td><td>0.32 </td><td>0.05 </td><td>0.10 </td><td>0.13\n</td></tr><tr><td>11 </td><td>0.22 </td><td>0.03 </td><td>0.07 </td><td>0.08\n</td></tr><tr><td>12 </td><td>0.15 </td><td>0.02 </td><td>0.05 </td><td>0.06\n</td></tr><tr><td>13 </td><td>0.10 </td><td>0.02 </td><td>0.04 </td><td>0.04\n</td></tr><tr><td>14 </td><td>0.08 </td><td>0.01 </td><td>0.03 </td><td>0.03\n</td></tr><tr><td>15 </td><td>0.05 </td><td>0.01 </td><td>0.03 </td><td>0.02\n</td></tr></table></body></html>"}, "TABREF2": {"text": "MIR in the 7 PLOS journals: percentage of articles that contain sentences with at least N references", "latex": null, "type": "table", "html": "<html><body><table><tr><td>Journal </td><td>N = 1 (%) </td><td>N = 2 (%) </td><td>N = 3 (%) </td><td>N = 4 (%) </td><td>N = 5 (%) </td><td>N = 10 (%) </td><td>N = 15 (%) </td><td>N = 20 (%)\n</td></tr><tr><td>PLOS Biology </td><td>100.00 </td><td>100.00 </td><td>99.37 </td><td>95.50 </td><td>84.38 </td><td>18.98 </td><td>3.71 </td><td>1.03\n</td></tr><tr><td>PLOS Comp.
