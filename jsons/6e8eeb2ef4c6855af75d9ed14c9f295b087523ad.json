Our main objective is to provide predictions of the number of infected people for different countries in the next 14 days. The predictive analysis is done using time-series data transformed on a logarithmic scale. We use two well-known methods for prediction: polynomial regression and neural network. As the number of training data for each country is limited, we use a single-layer neural network called the extreme learning machine (ELM) to avoid over-fitting. Due to the non-stationary nature of the time-series, a sliding window approach is used to provide a more accurate prediction.",

In the first set of experiments, we implement cross-validation to find the hyperparameters without using the observed samples of the time-series as we proceed through 31 days span. In the second set of experiments, we implement cross-validation in a daily manner as we observe new samples of the time-series. In the latter setup, the window size w varied with respect to time to find the optimal hyperparameters as we proceed through time. We refer to this setup as 'ELM time-varying' and 'Poly time-varying' in the rest of the manuscript. We first show the reported and estimated number of infection cases for Sweden by using ELM time-varying for different \u03c4 's in Figure 1 . For each \u03c4 , we estimate the number of cases up to \u03c4 days after which JHU data is collected. In our later experiments, we show that ELM time-varying is typically more accurate than the other three methods (polynomial, Poly timevarying, and ELM). This better accuracy conforms to the nonstationary behavior of the time-series data, or in other words that the best model parameters change over time. Hence, the result of ELM time-varying is shown explicitly for Sweden. According to our experimental result, we predict that a total of 23039, 23873, and 26184 people will be infected in Sweden on May 5, May 7, and May 11, 2020, respectively.",

The daily error percentage for each country in Table I is shown in Figures 7-15 . Note that the reported error percentage of ELM is averaged over 100 Monte Carlo trials. The average and the standard deviation of the error over 31 days is reported (in percentage) in the legend of each of the figures for all four methods. It can be seen that daily cross-validation is crucial to preserve a consistent performance through-out the pandemic, resulting in a more accurate estimate. In other words, the variations of the time-series as n increases is significant enough to change the statistics of the training and validation set, which, in turn, leads to different optimal hyperparameters as the length of the time-series grows. It can also be seen that ELM time-varying provides a more accurate estimate, especially for large values of \u03c4 .

We found that a daily update of the model hyperparameters is of paramount importance to achieve a stable prediction performance. The proposed models currently use the only samples of the time-series data to predict the future number of cases. A potential future direction to improve the estimation accuracy is to incorporate constraints such as infectious disease spread model, non-pharmaceutical interventions, and authority policies [2]. ",
