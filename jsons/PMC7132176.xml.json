            "text": "Most of us might experience annoyance when, during hectic schedules for pre\u2010 and post\u2010conference travel, let alone the intensity of a meeting, we are required by administrators to record and declare \u201cproper\u201d expenses for every penny or cent we are spending for transportation and lodging. Subsequently, we patiently wait for the administration to decide whether our various expenses can be deemed refundable. From our own personal experience, we feel that the entire process of reporting expenses and claiming reimbursements for travelling and meeting colleagues has been deteriorating over the past couple of years in terms of productivity and efficiency. Naturally, some administrations are more effective than others, yet overall the bureaucracy has been increasing to unreasonable levels that require\u2014and waste\u2014a huge amount of time and energy for budgeting, planning and payments 1.",

Travelling to a meeting or conference might sound like fun to accountants, but science travel is a serious responsibility, a career non\u2010option and indeed a mission. Scientists risk health incidents, from sharp or emerging epidemics\u2014such as SARS or the ongoing COVID\u201019\u2014to long\u2010term health effects\u2014notably DVT, red tape issues, such as visas and border checks, and weather\u2010related snags, such as dreadful delays, time away from home with whatever this entails 2, hidden yet real costs that cannot be directly reported and even serious life\u2010threatening situations 3. One of us was hospitalised abroad with a serious influenza episode and the other with a serious infection manifesting symptoms onboard a trans\u2010continental flight. We can remember other dire moments: a colleague who passed away from DVT as a frequent flyer across continents, confusing protocols over passports/IDs, visa waivers or the \u201cSchengen Treaty,\u201d violent storms or volcanic eruptions grounding our flights for days in North America or Europe, sacrificing another precious weekend with the family for a dull meeting at a remote location, thousands of euros, pounds and dollars that were \u201cnot acceptable\u201d for reimbursement, occasions of political instability and all kinds of minor or less minor accidents.",

            "text": "With modern technology and a greater push for financial transparency 4, administrators should now look for ways to minimise the hassle of reporting travel expenses for scientists\u2014anecdotes abound 5. It is time to realise that science travel is an assignment that needs to be carried out, often under adverse conditions, and not some happy opportunity to escape from the office. Most scientists are passionate and creative professionals who enjoy meetings as a way to interact and discuss their research and not as an extra vacation. Such a realistic view should inform the mentality and procedures of auditing and expense claims. For example, an aggressive, generous and precise per diem system for research groups works well in the United States 6 and helps to diminish frustration and costs. Another productive solution in terms of reimbursement policy would be self\u2010managed travel budgets under the PI's responsibility. Ideally, we would envisage a more flexible framework with pre\u2010paid credit cards; fully booked travel itineraries with the help of dedicated staff; in\u2010advance bank payments\u2014especially for graduate students and post\u2010doctoral fellows 7; and an easy and hassle\u2010free system to declare justified but unexpected costs. Many of these policies and procedures are already implemented at various institutions, including ours; but a standardised and cross\u2010validated process that endorses some of the best practices worldwide will be a significant step forward for everyone.",

Epidemic outbreaks and climate change only make things worse 8, 9, and even less predictable for global travellers. With little effort and some insight, science travel should again become a mission to promote research and scholarship and not another burden to endure.",
