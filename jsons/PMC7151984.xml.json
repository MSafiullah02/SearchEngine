In 2004, pneumonia, along with influenza, was the eighth leading cause of death in the USA, the sixth leading cause of death in those over age 65, and the principal cause of death from infectious diseases.1 When the infection occurs in patients who are living in the community it is termed community acquired pneumonia (CAP), while it is called nosocomial pneumonia if it arises in patients who are already in hospital.2,\n3 However, the distinction between these two forms of infection is becoming increasing blurred because of the complexity of patients who are now living outwith hospital, including those in nursing homes, those receiving chronic hemodialysis and those recently admitted to hospital, all of whom have contact with the health-care environment and may import multidrug-resistant (MDR) organisms when they come to the hospital with \u2018healthcare-associated pneumonia\u2019 (HCAP). Thus, the relationship between bacteriology and the site of origin of infection is a reflection of several factors, including the co-morbid illnesses present in the patient who develops pneumonia, their host-defense status and their environmental exposure to specific pathogens.4 This discussion focuses on patients who develop pneumonia out of the hospital (including CAP and HCAP), who are not HIV infected and who do not have traditional immune suppression (cancer chemotherapy, immune suppressive medications).",

The normal lung immune response to infection is generally \u2018compartmentalized\u2019 and thus most patients with unilateral pneumonia have an inflammatory response that is limited to the site of infection. In patients with localized pneumonia, tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8 levels are increased in the pneumonic lung and generally not increased in the uninvolved lung or in the serum.10 Patients with severe pneumonia have increased serum levels of TNF and IL-6. It remains uncertain why localization does not occur in all individuals, but it is likely that genetic polymorphisms in the immune response may explain some of these differences, with patients who have certain inherited patterns of response being more prone than others to severe forms of pneumonia, and even mortality from this illness.11,\n12 For example, CAP severity is increased with genetic changes in the IL-10 1082 locus, which are often present along with changes in the TNF 308 locus.11,\n12 Currently, there are a large number of genes that have been identified as being able to affect the severity and outcome of CAP, but the ability to use this information to impact patient management does not currently exist.",

Patients with advanced age often have a longer duration of symptoms such as cough, sputum production, dyspnea, fatigue, anorexia, myalgia and abdominal pain than younger patients. In addition, they have delirium or acute confusion more often than younger patients. Very few elderly patients with pneumonia are considered well nourished, with kwashiorkor-like malnutrition being the predominant type of nutritional defect and the one associated with delirium on initial presentation.29\n",

Other physical findings can be signs of pleural effusion, metastatic infection (arthritis, endocarditis, meningitis) or extrapulmonary manifestations that can occur with M. pneumoniae or C. pneumoniae. One of the most important physical assessments in CAP is a careful measurement of respiratory rate, which can have both diagnostic and prognostic relevance. In the elderly, an elevation of respiratory rate may be the initial presenting sign of pneumonia, preceding other clinical findings by as much as 1\u20132 days.30 In general, tachypnea is the most common finding in elderly patients; it is present in over 60% of all patients, but occurs more often in the elderly than in younger patients with pneumonia. Measurement of respiratory rate also has prognostic significance and the presence of a respiratory rate greater than 30 per minute is one of several factors associated with increased risk of mortality.",

The antipneumococcal quinolones are being widely used in North America because as a single drug, given once daily, it is possible to cover pneumococcus (including DRSP), Gram-negatives and atypical pathogens. In addition, quinolones penetrate well into respiratory secretions and are highly bioavailable, achieving the same serum levels with oral or intravenous therapy. There are differences among the available agents in their intrinsic activity against pneumococcus and, based on MIC data, these agents can be ranked from most to least active as: gemifloxacin (available only in oral form), moxifloxacin and levofloxacin. Some data suggest a lower likelihood of both clinical failures and the induction of pneumococcal resistance to quinolones if the more-active agents are used in place of the less-active agents.2,\n20 UK and European guidelines do not recommend fluoroquinolones as initial therapy in severe pneumococcal CAP because of residual concerns regarding the clinical effectiveness of these agents, as well as concerns about their contribution to health-care-associated infection (e.g. Clostridium difficile). Although oral quinolones may be as effective as intravenous quinolones for admitted patients with moderately severe illness, most admitted patients should receive initial therapy intravenously to be sure that the medication has been absorbed. Once the patient shows a good clinical response, oral therapy can be started.",
