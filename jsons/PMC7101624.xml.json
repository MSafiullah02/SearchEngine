In contrast, mortality rates associated with 2009 H1N1 infection in patients with hematologic tumors or HSCT recipients have been reported to be up to 46 % [6], even though these rates vary considerably among studies, accounting for variable underlying conditions and settings [1\u20133, 6\u20138]. Our present report demonstrated that nosocomial 2009 H1N1 outbreak in the hematology ward can lead to fatal clinical outcome at a markedly high rate, i.e. 3 (43 %) of 7 patients with hematologic tumors and 3 (60 %) of 5 HSCT recipients. In one report, nosocomial acquisition of the virus itself was recognized as a risk factor requiring admission to the intensive care unit for mechanical ventilation [3]. Therefore, it is desirable for all healthcare workers in hematology wards to implement stringent infection control measures during an influenza season. On the other hand, risk factors identified by the data collection from the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation and the Spanish Group of haematopoietic stem cell transplantation to be associated with significant morbidity and mortality in HSCT recipients who developed 2009 H1N1 infection, including age, lymphopenia (<300/\u03bcl), and neutropenia (<500/\u03bcl) [9], were not necessarily applicable to our cases (Tables 1, 2).",

            "text": "It is noteworthy that the H275Y mutant virus was detected in 3 of 7 patients. Since case 5 was initially infected with the wild-type virus and was immediately admitted to the intensive care unit localized in the independent ward (Figs. 1, 2), and since the other two patients were each isolated in a single-patient room following infection-control measures, it is unlikely that the mutant virus was transmitted among these 3 patients, but rather H275Y mutants seem to have developed independently in each patient. The Infectious Disease Surveillance Center reported that oseltamivir-resistant 2009 H1N1 strains account for 1.0 % (79/8,145 in the 2009\u20132010 season) to 2.0 % (78/3,805 in the 2010\u20132011 season) of all isolated viruses in Japan [11]. On the other hand, the risk of the 2009 H1N1 virus developing the H275Y mutation that confers oseltamivir resistance is considered to be higher in immunocompromised patients [3]. Our present report suggests that universal chemoprophylaxis with oseltamivir for severely immunocompromised patients, such as HSCT recipients, during an outbreak can facilitate the development and/or selective growth of the oseltamivir-resistant virus. This is in clear contrast with immunocompetent hosts, in whom an oseltamivir \u201cring\u201d prophylaxis was effective in reducing the impact of outbreaks of 2009 H1N1 in semi-closed environments without emergence of the H275Y strain [12].",

It is apparent that the standard dose and duration of oseltamivir, i.e. 75 mg twice daily for 5 days, are insufficient for immunocompromised patients. Instead, an increased dose and duration of oseltamivir, as well as combining this treatment with other available anti-viral drugs, may be initiated at the onset of symptoms of influenza irrespective of the severity of the illness. Prospective randomized studies for patients with hematologic tumors or HSCT recipients are needed to determine the optimal dose and schedule of anti-virals to efficiently eradicate the 2009 H1N1 virus from these very vulnerable patients.",
