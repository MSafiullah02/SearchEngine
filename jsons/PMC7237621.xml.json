Between 2000 and 2017, although overall under-five mortality decreased, the proportion of global neonatal deaths among under-five children increased from 40 to 47% [1]. In particular, Ethiopia ranks as having the 21st worst neonatal mortality rate, with 29 deaths per 1000 live births in 2017 [1]. Four out of every fifth neonatal death could be prevented with simple tools [2]. Despite the introduction of neonatal intensive care units (NICUs), neonatal deaths remain high in low- and middle- countries (LMICs). Low-resource NICUs are often unable to provide simple life-sustaining medical intervention due to a lack of trained health personnel, equipment deficiencies, and drug shortages [3].",

This hospital serves more than 7 million individuals and cares for approximately 10,000 children every year. The hospital is staffed by sixth-year medical students, pediatric residents, and general practitioners. The NICU in Gondar has approximately 40 beds in which neonates can receive thermoregulation, nasogastric tube feedings, phototherapy, blood transfusions, intravenous fluids, antibiotics, oxygen via nasal canula, and bubble continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). The NICU admission criteria include the following: birthweight less than 2000 g, gestational age less than 34 weeks, suspected or confirmed infection, temperature instability, respiratory distress, apnea, cyanosis, electrolyte derangements, birth trauma, seizures, birth asphyxia, altered mentation, feeding problem, bilious emesis, signs of bowel obstruction, hyperbilirubinemia, ABO and Rh incompatibility, anemia, polycythemia, bleeding disorder, cardiovascular disease requiring monitoring or interventions, any baby whom the physician or nurse feels the baby requires observation or treatment, and social issues like abandoned babies. The unit does not have a neonatologist and does not have mechanical ventilation capabilities; however, there is a plan to start mechanical ventilation and procure an arterial blood gas machine in the near future. The challenges in Gondar are similar to other NICUs in developing countries with limited resources, technology, and personnel [20].",
