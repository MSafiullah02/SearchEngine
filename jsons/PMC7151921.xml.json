In a study of patients undergoing major surgery in New York, 5.2% were HCV positive, 1.4% HBV positive, and 1.6% HIV positive (or 6.7% with one or more of these viruses).1 Often, the presence of infection is unknown or unreported to the pathology department. Healthcare workers are at risk for contracting these diseases by working with patients. The risk is lower for pathology personnel, but exposure can occur by aerosolization of tissues, needlestick injury, scalpel wounds, and mucocutaneous exposure during the processing of pathology specimens (Box 8-1\n).BOX 8\u20131Diseases that have been transmitted to healthcare workers\n\u2022Hepatitis B, C, and A\u2022Tuberculosis (including strains resistant to multiple drugs)\u2022HIV\u2022Syphilis\u2022Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease\u2022\nCoccidioides immitis (risk is primarily from cultures of the fungus in microbiology laboratories); if this infection is suspected all specimens must be labeled appropriately\u2022Also parvovirus, H. pylori, Cryptosporidium, scabies, pertussis\n",

Most injuries and exposure to blood and other body fluids can be prevented if the following guidelines are followed:\u2022Gloves must be worn when handling fresh and fixed tissues. Two pairs of gloves are recommended for hazardous specimens, as small tears in gloves are common. Metal mesh and Kevlar cloth type gloves can help prevent puncture injuries\u2022Latex gloves will protect against biohazards but not fixatives. Nitrile gloves will also provide protection from fixatives. Some individuals (5% to 10%) have or develop allergic reactions (usually dermatitis but sometimes asthma or anaphylaxis) to latex antigens.\u2022Do not touch objects in general use (door handles, telephone, computer, etc.) with contaminated gloves.\u2022Hands must always be washed after handling specimens and after leaving a specimen handling area because gloves are not completely leakproof.\u2022Protective clothing, including gloves, must be removed and disposed of properly before leaving the surgical cutting or OR consultation rooms.\u2022Scrub suits or disposable jumpsuits are recommended if large bloody specimens need to be processed.\u2022Aprons must be worn when handling many specimens (e.g., at a cutting bench) or for handling large specimens.\u2022If lab coats are worn while working in the surgical cutting room, they cannot be worn outside of this area.\u2022Any person using a scalpel blade, razor blade, or syringe needle is responsible for disposing of it properly. Scalpel blades are removed from the handle with extreme caution after gross blood and tissue have been removed. Frozen section blocks are not removed from the chuck with a razor blade. Holding the stem for a few seconds will melt the embedding medium sufficiently for removal with a fingertip. Syringe needles are never recapped. All blades, needles, and disposable scissors must be discarded into impervious labeled sharps containers. Broken glass slides and coverslips must also be disposed into designated containers.\u2022Reusable but contaminated equipment should be decontaminated with bleach.\u2022All tissues are fixed as soon as possible. Unfixed specimens must be kept in leakproof containers and stored in an appropriate biohazard refrigerator or freezer.\u2022Always dispose of all blood and tissue fragments before leaving a worksite. All tissues, or nonreusable material contaminated by any body fluid or tissue, must be disposed in labeled hazardous waste containers (containers with red bags and biohazard symbols). Urine, blood, and feces may be disposed directly into the municipal sewerage system.\u2022Areas contaminated after handling a known infectious case should be immediately cleaned with dilute bleach.\n\u2022Eye protection should be worn when cutting into large specimens. Cysts may feel deceptively solid when filled with fluid. Such fluid may be under pressure and can travel several feet when the cyst is opened (this has been documented by many pathologists!). Place near sink on a surgical drape or blue barrier and make a small nick near the bottom in order to let fluid slowly drain out of the cyst.\u2022Food or beverages must not be consumed, or brought into, the cutting room or the OR consultation room. Foods cannot be stored in refrigerators used to store specimens. Food or food containers (e.g., an empty coffee cup) cannot be disposed into containers in these areas as this may be used as evidence that food consumption is occurring in these areas. Evidence of food consumption is monitored by OSHA and can be grounds for penalties or closure.\n",
