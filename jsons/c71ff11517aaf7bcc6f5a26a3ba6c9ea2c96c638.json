In addition, unused labeled primers produce background signal and use up reagents during the detection part of the assay. Because of these issues, post-PCR cleanup (such as spin column puri fi cation) is often required to remove these labeled primers before they can be used as probes. Yet, high-concentration primers are only required in the last cycles of a PCR reaction. With tem-PCR, the amounts of gene-speci fi c primers used is only enough to enrich the targets and incorporate the SuperPrimer tag into the PCR products. After enrichment and tag incorporation, ampli fi cation is carried out with only one pair of primers. Because only one pair of primers is labeled, the background is low; therefore, no post-PCR cleanup is required.

There are, however, two major differences between tem-PCR and arm-PCR: (1) with tem-PCR, the concentrations of gene-speci fi c nested primers are very low, but with arm-PCR, the primer concentrations are high in order to increase ampli fi cation sensitivity and ef fi ciency; (2) with tem-PCR, the universal SuperPrimers are included in the initial reaction together with the nested gene-speci fi c primers, but with arm-PCR, the universal primers are not included in the initial reaction. The amplicons from the fi rst round of PCR are rescued after removing the nested primers, and the universal, communal primers are then added for a second round of PCR.",

Currently, there are two major detection methods: sequencing and hybridization. Before discussing detection platforms, it will be helpful to address a common misunderstanding regarding the use of next-generation sequencing in molecular diagnosis of infectious diseases. It is sometimes believed that, with the advance of high throughput sequencing technology and the accompanying rapid price drop, PCR will soon become an outdated technology and will no longer be needed. This is not true. Because sequencing is only a detection technology, it cannot increase the signal-to-noise ratio, which is critical in infectious disease diagnosis. For example, in bloodstream infections, peripheral blood samples from patients may have only 20 copies of the bacterial genome per milliliter of blood, but will have millions copies of the host genome. At that low signal-to-noise ratio, false positive rates will be extremely high and unacceptable for clinical applications. High-throughput sequencing will be useful in infectious disease diagnosis only if the signal-to-noise ratio can be increased signi fi cantly, and that requires mPCR. mPCR products can be sequenced directly with relatively low cost thanks to technology advances in this fi eld. To further reduce the cost, a molecular tag (barcode) system can be used during ampli fi cation; then, after ampli fi cation, hundreds of samples can be pooled together for one sequencing run, and software can be used to identify and differentiate the samples. The most promising sequencing platforms are Illumina MiSeq ( www.ilumina.com ) and Roche 454 Jr ( www.roche.com ), which both cost around $120,000 USD, while the reagents cost a few hundred dollars per run. If 10-20 samples are pooled in one run, the sequence analysis cost per sample will be under $50.",

For each pathogen, target-speci fi c capture probes are covalently linked to a speci fi c set of color-coded microspheres. Labeled PCR products are captured by the bead-bound capture probes in a hybridization suspension. A micro fl uidics system delivers the suspension hybridization reaction mixture to a dual-laser detection device.

Another important feature of the xMAP platform is its repeatability. Because everything occurs in a homogeneous solution (from bead manufacture, color-code staining, and capture probe coupling to product hybridization and data collection), highly repeatable results are obtained with this platform. The xMAP method for collecting and reporting data also contributes to repeatability. Typically, there are 5,000 beads added per reaction for each color-coded bead set. Each bead set is speci fi c for a particular disease marker, such as a mutation or a pathogen. The laser counts 100 microspheres from each bead set and reports the median fl uorescent intensity (MFI).

At the core of the iCubate technology is a single-use cassette that comes preloaded with all the reagents necessary to perform extraction, ampli fi cation, and detection steps. The closed design of the cassette guarantees that the highconcentration amplicons contained inside have no chance of contaminating the lab.

Many studies have shown that active surveillance, plus patient isolation, is one of the most effective methods to reduce HAIs [ 15 ] . Regularly scheduled surveys of critical environments (such as the ICU), instruments, and healthcare providers will raise the level of awareness and identify problems early. When an outbreak of HAI occurs, MDDs can quickly identify the source of an infection, helping healthcare providers determine which patients should be isolated to prevent the spread of the microorganisms. In an increasing number of states, hospitals are required to publish their rate of HAI, which is calculated based on discharge records. However, some patients may be misclassi fi ed as having an HAI because they were asymptomatic carriers before being admitted to the hospital. MDDs can help hospitals better identify, control, and report HAIs, thereby lessening their liability. As a result, MDDs can help reduce costs, shorten hospital stays, and improve the quality of care, while protecting pro fi ts.",

Traditionally, these fi nancial activities occurred in three subcategories: providers (such as hospitals, nursing homes, and diagnostic laboratories), payers (such as insurance companies), and life sciences (such as biotechnology and pharmaceuticals). For example, the cost of developing a new drug can be as high as $800 million [ 17 ] . That cost is passed on from the life science sector to the payers and then to the providers.
