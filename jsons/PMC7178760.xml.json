            "text": "Hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) is extremely contagious and prevalent among infants and children aged less than 5 years. Human enterovirus 71 (EV71) has been considered the major pathogen for HFMD, having triggered several disease outbreaks worldwide with high morbidity and mortality rates since its initial isolation in 1969 [1\u20135]. Multiple countries in America, Europe, Australia and Asia had seen the EV71 epidemic since 1970s [2\u20135]. During 1997 and 1998, several EV71 outbreaks occurred in Asia, including Sarawak, Malaysia, Japan and Taiwan, while fatal cases were reported [6\u20139]. The latest large Asian epidemic was in mainland China during 2007 and 2008, with 488,955 cases as well as 126 deaths reported [10, 11]. Since the establishment of national surveillance system in 2008, more than 15 million HFMD cases were reported according to the China National Center for Disease Control (CDC) by 2015, with over 3400 deaths. EV71 predominated among the laboratory-confirmed cases, especially for the severe and fatal cases [12, 13]. Meanwhile, various EV71 vaccines have been developed , and since 2015 three EV71 vaccines have been approved by Chinese FDA to prevent the continuous epidemics [14\u201316], which were separately developed by Institure of Medical Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences (CAMS, Kunming Institute), Sinovac Biotech Co., Ltd., and China National Biotech Group. All approved vaccines comprise inactivated viruses with the obvious advantage of almost complete immune protection; in fact, the vaccines are proved to protect over 90% vaccinated children from EV71-related HFMD or herpangina [10, 14, 15, 17].",

There\u2019re also two inspiring examples, VLP-based hepatitis B virus and human papillomavirus vaccines, which have been successfully commercialized [23, 24]. Recombinant EV71 VLPs can resemble the natural virus structure in terms of their capsid proteins. Immunization with such VLPs can induce EV71-specific immune response with high neutralizing antibody titers and increased cytokines in mouse model [18, 25\u201327]. Considering the EV71 inactivated whole-virus vaccines are unable to prevent infection caused by other major agents of HFMD, such as CA16, CA10 and CA6, multivalent vaccines deriving from VLPs are regarded as another option for disease prevention [12, 24].",

Furthermore, we engineered these peptides into one fusion protein (including P70\u2013249, P324\u2013443 and P746\u2013876), using a prokaryotic expression system. The expressed fusion protein finally assembled into sphere-like particulates (VLPs) of 25\u201340 nm, and were proved to induce humoral and cell-mediated immunity effectively in mice after vaccination, with the detection of high-titer antibodies and promoted splenocyte proliferation and cytokine secretion [18].

The targeted protein was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3), upon induction with 1 mM isopropyl-D-thiogalactopyranoside, as inclusion bodies, which were solubilized and denatured in the denaturant buffer containing guanidine chloride. Thereafter, it was purified via a series of ions exchange in urea buffer, while the additive in solution was eliminated using a desalting column. Thereafter, 1 mM CaCl2 was added into the desalted sample to initiate the assembly of VLPs. Finally, the fusion protein was stored in 10 mM Glycine-NaOH buffer (pH = 8.0) with 5% glycerol [18].",

To further investigate the immune efficacy of the fusion protein as a vaccine candidate, we attempted three immunization dosages (10 \u03bcg, 2 \u03bcg, and 0.4 \u03bcg) to determine the optimal level of immunization. With an increase in the levels of the fusion protein, the neutralization activity of mouse serum obtained upon second immunization was significantly enhanced. Using the CPE method, the measured neutralization titers (NTs) were as follows: below 25 for the 0.4 \u03bcg dosage group, above 26 for the 2 \u03bcg dosage group, and approximately 27 for the 10 \u03bcg dosage group (Fig. 1a). Based on the aforementioned results, we used 10 \u03bcg of fusion protein as a vaccine candidate for subsequent experiments. Meanwhile, booster immunization was necessary to gain higher NTs (Fig. 1b and Fig. 1c). The neutralization titer in the serum of mice immunized once peaked at 22 after 2 weeks of immunization, and no decrease in immune response was observed after 6 weeks (Fig. 1b). For the mice with booster immunization, 4 weeks after the initial immunization, the NTs peaked at approximately 27 a week after immunization and remained high (above 26 6 weeks post immunization) (Fig. 1c). The same situation occurred in the positive control, wherein mice immunized with the inactivated virus (Fig. 1), demonstrating that booster immunization induced a stronger humoral immune response.\n",

No adverse effects of pre-mating immunity on normal pregnancy and production of female mice were found, and no significant differences in physiological status of their neonatal mice were found either, compared to normal female or neonatal mice (data not unshown).When infected with 200 LD50 of MP10 (a mouse-adapted EV71 strain), all negative control mice died 6 days-post-infection (d.p.i), while those in the positive control group still survived at 10 d.p.i. For the fusion protein immunization group, with an increase in the level of fusion protein, the survival rate of the neonatal mice also increased from 23% (0.04 \u03bcg) to 54% (2 \u03bcg) and to 87% (10 \u03bcg). The protective effect of maternal antibodies was more obvious when encountering a minor viral challenge with 10LD50. Except for the lowest dosage group (0.04 \u03bcg), immunization with the fusion protein completely inhibited EV71-mediated damage to neonatal mice. In contrast, mice in the negative control group died at 8 d.p.i, while those in the positive control group survived. Hence, similar to immunization with the inactivated virus vaccination, immunization of dams with the fusion protein effectively protected the neonatal mice against EV71 infection in cases of an infection at a low viral load.\n",

            "text": "Prophylactic vaccines are extremely important to prevent the EV71 epidemic, especially for susceptible children. Owing to their complete immunoprotective activity, viral inactivated vaccines are the preferred treatment strategy. In mainland China, the development and clinical evaluation of inactivated EV71 vaccines and the promotion of vaccinations have progressed rapidly to prevent the prevalence of HFMD caused by EV71 infection [14\u201317, 33]. Meanwhile, to compensate for the low productivity deficits of inactivated vaccines, other strategies for vaccine development have been considered. Notwithstanding advancements in DNA vaccines [34], those containing recombinant protein subunits [35, 36], and those containing live attenuated viruses [37\u201339], VLPs have yielded more advantageous recombinant vaccines. VLP vaccines can fuse multiple antigenic sites together to completely expose epitopes on the surface, thereby inducing a more effective immune response [20, 22, 24\u201327, 40]. A novel EV71 VLP lacking VP4 (designated VLP\u0394VP4) structurally mimics the 80S empty capsid, which is the end stage of EV71 uncoating, thereby exhibiting desirable immunogenicity and protection as a vaccine candidate [22]. A tetravalent VLP vaccine comprising CVA10-VLP, EV71-VLP, CVA16-VLP, and CVA6-VLP reportedly elicited antigen-specific lasting serum antibody responses with neutralization titers similar to those of their monovalent counterparts. Most importantly, passively transferred tetravalent vaccine-immunized sera showed efficient protective effects against single or mixed infections with EV71, CVA16, CVA10, and CVA6 viruses in mice [24]. HFMD is a multi-pathogen disease with more than 20 pathogens, and cases of CA16, CA10 and CA6 infection have increased year by year. Therefore, it\u2019s necessary to develop multivalent vaccines, and VLP vaccines can be a potential choice.",

Subsequently, using a highly efficient prokaryotic expression system, the fused protein was expressed as inclusion bodies and dissolved, purified, and refolded to form pentameric molecules, and finally assembled into spherical particles [18]. In the present study, we further assessed the immunoprotective effects of the fusion protein as a vaccine candidate. The highest dosage of the fusion protein (10 \u03bcg for immunization) and booster immunization induced specific serum antibodies with the highest neutralization titers, and the protective antibodies were transmitted from the dams to the progeny, thereby protecting the neonatal mice from EV71-mediated damage. Meantime, immunoprotective effects were also observed in neonatal mice after immunization with the fusion protein. Combined with the increased proliferation of splenocytes and secretion of cytokines (including IFN-\u03b3, IL-2, IL-4, and IL-5), according to our previous report [18], the fusion protein effectively induced humoral and cell-mediated immune responses.",

Since EV71 induced IgG was permitted to enter into brain tissues by the increased permeability of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) after EV71 infection, cross-reactivity might result in neurological symptoms [31, 41, 42]. In addition, a common epitope (PPGAPKP) between capsid VP1 protein and human mediator complex subunit (MED25) was identified, suggesting the involvement of the immune response in neurological complications caused by EV71 infection [43]. The component fragment P746\u2013876 and P324\u2013443 of the fusion protein displayed weak positive cross-reactivity, hence probably resulting in weak cross-reactivity of the entire fusion protein. However, after immunizing neonates with the inactivated whole virus, no case of side reaction in brain was reported; hence, we presumed that the cross-reactivity may have resulted from the exposure of intracellular cross-antigens during the preparation of brain tissue sections, and it has been suggested that immune cross-reactivity should be monitored upon administration of the whole inactivated virus vaccine to children with neurological diseases.",
