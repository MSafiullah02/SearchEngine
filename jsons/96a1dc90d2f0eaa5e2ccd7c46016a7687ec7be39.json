In Piedmont and Aosta Valley, mainly symptomatic patients or patients at high risk of exposure (e.g. health care workers exposed to positive patients without adequate protection) have been tested until now. This approach may have caused a substantial underestimation of positive patients, preventing exact calculation of mortality rates. However, in the last days, the health authorities have extended indications, at least among healthcare professionals. Moreover, clinicians of the emergency and intensive care units are commonly using radiographic signs suggestive of interstitial pneumonia as surrogate criteria of SARS-CoV-2 disease.",

SARS-COV-2 cases were unevenly distributed within the Regions ranging from 0 to maximum of 25 cases per Nephrology Unit. The difference in number of cases among the Units may reflect a true variability in the incidence of positive cases in Piedmont and Aosta Valley. However, the high number of cases in single Centers might also be due to intra-hospital spreading of the infection. In this context, it is worth emphasising the need to comply with the correct hygienic rules, including hand disinfection and use of surgical masks by personnel and patients.",
