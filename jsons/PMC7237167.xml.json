So dire is the situation that the CDC is recommending scarves and bandanas to serve as makeshift facemasks when all legitimate supplies of facemasks are exhausted [2]. Sewing machines have even been setup in some hospitals for practitioners to create their own homemade mask. Here, we propose a makeshift filter mask, which we call the Modified Airway from VEntilatoR Circuit (MAVerIC), that can be assembled within seconds using widely available supplies routinely utilized by anesthesia providers in the operating room (OR) to provide practitioners on the frontlines with the high standard of protection of a N95 mask during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, and can be easily quantitatively \u201cfit tested\u201d to ensure no significant leak to optimize safety and efficacy.",

In contrast, the standard N95 masks are unable to form a proper fit when facial hair is present which makes it a poor piece of protective equipment when even a small amount of stubble is present, an there is no way to check if there is a surrounding leak. Of note, the quantitative fit testing of N95 masks involves the use of equipment that is on the order of thousands of dollars whereas the cost to perform a quantitative \u201cfit test\u201d for the MAVerIC is on the order of dollars with an ambu bag with pressure manometer.",
