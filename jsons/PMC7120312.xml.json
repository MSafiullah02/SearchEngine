The corona in coronavirus is a Latin word that means a \u201ccrown\u201d, and it indicates to the typical presentation of virions underneath electron microscopy with a periphery of hefty, globular surface projections similar to that of a crown. Coronavirus is a pathogen associated with severe respiratory symptoms and was first identified from the nasal cavities of sufferers with the common cold in the early 1960s (de Groot et al. 2013; Brown et al. 2012). These were named human coronavirus OC43 and human coronavirus 229E. A total of 40 sequenced genomes of different strains of coronavirus are accessible from National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), out of which 7 are pathogenic to humans. A coronavirus, i.e. SARS-CoV, was responsible for outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in the year 2003, whereas Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) caused the most recent outbreak in 2012 causing acute respiratory disease in affected people with signs of fever, cough and difficulty in breathing. After first reported from Saudi Arabia in 2012, this novel virus has also dispersed to other countries like the United States and was known to have high death rate. MERS-CoV infections are highly communicable, and no explicit antiviral cure has been designed for it till date (Azhar et al. 2017).",

RV approach has been successfully applied on many prokaryotes, but there are very few known applications on eukaryotes and viruses. So, it is worthwhile to explore the potential of this approach to identify potential vaccine candidates for coronavirus. RV basically does the in silico examination of the viral proteome to hunt antigenic and surface-exposed proteins. This approach was initially applied successfully to Neisseria meningitidis serogroup B (Kelly and Rappuoli 2005) against which none of the prevailing techniques could develop a vaccine. The present book chapter is intended to explore the potential of RV approach to select the probable vaccine candidates against coronavirus and validate the results using docking studies.",

However, the traditional approach suffers from certain limitations like it is very time-consuming, the pathogens which can\u2019t be cultivated in the lab conditions are out of reach, and certain non-abundant proteins are not accessible using this approach (Rappuoli 2000). Consequently, a number of pathogenic diseases are left without any vaccine against them. All these limitations are conquered by reverse vaccinology approach utilizing genome sequence information which ultimately is translated into proteins. Hence all the proteins expressed by the genome are accessible irrespective of their abundance, conditions in which they expressed. The credit of fame of reverse vaccinology should go to the advancements in the sequencing strategies worldwide. Accordingly, improvement in the sequencing technologies has flooded the genome databases with huge amount of data which can be computationally undertaken to reveal the various crucial aspects of the virulence factors of the concerned pathogen. Reverse vaccinology is based on same approach of computationally analysing the genome of pathogen and proceeds step by step to ultimately identify the highly antigenic, secreted proteins with high epitope densities. The best epitopes are selected as potential vaccine candidates (Pizza et al. 2000). This approach has brought the unapproachable pathogens of interest in spotlight and is evolving as the most reassuring tool for precise selection of vaccine candidates and brought the use of peptide vaccines in trend (Sette and Rappuoli 2010; Kanampalliwar et al. 2013).",

Whether it is discovery of pili in gram-positive pathogens which were thought to not have any pili or the sighting of factor G-binding protein in meningococcus (Alessandro and Rino 2010), the reverse vaccinology steals all the credits from other conventional approaches. Most of the applications of RV are against prokaryotes and very few against eukaryotes and viruses because of complexity of their genome. Corynebacterium urealyticum (Guimar\u00e3es et al. 2015), Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Monterrubio-L\u00f3pez et al. 2015), H. pylori (Naz et al. 2015), Acinetobacter baumannii (Chiang et al. 2015), Rickettsia prowazekii (Caro-Gomez et al. 2014), Neospora caninum (Goodswen et al. 2014) and Brucella melitensis (Vishnu et al. 2017) are the examples of some pathogens that are recently approached using this in silico technique in order to spot some epitopes having potential of being a vaccine candidate.

However, five proteins are acidic and show negative charge. The negative GRAVY score of five proteins justify them to be of hydrophilic nature with majority of the residues positioned towards the surface. For the rest of six proteins, the GRAVY score is positive; it means that these are hydrophobic proteins. The proteins with less than 40 value of instability index are quite stable than those with higher values.

This exhibits the effectiveness of lightweight proteins as targets as they can be easily purified because of their low molecular weights. The protein YP_009047204.1 is reported as a spike glycoprotein. It is acidic with prominent negative charge, with negative GRAVY score which suggests its hydrophilicity and presence on surface.

These epitopes are from spike glycoprotein, NS3 protein, NS4B protein and envelope protein. Unfortunately none of the epitope is found conserved in other strains, and all are specific to MERS-CoV. The docking analysis studies revealed perfect binding between HLA-A*0201 receptor and epitopes. The conserved residues of the receptor site are also involved in H-bonding with epitope residues. Further, the selected antigenic epitopes must be validated using in vitro and in vivo studies to confirm their potential as vaccine candidates.",
