However, the factors that determine the clinical outcomes associated with RTIs in persons with asthma are not well understood. Host factors governing inflammatory and immune responses have been demonstrated to influence whether a host with asthma experiencing a viral RTI will develop an exacerbation of symptoms [7] [8] [9] [10] . In contrast, it remains unresolved whether variation in viral pathogens may also influence this outcome. For example, despite the prominent association between HRVs and asthma exacerbation, deliberate inoculation of a laboratory-adapted HRV-16 isolate into subjects with asthma did not produce wheezing, despite efficient infection and the generation of upper respiratory tract symptoms [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] . Although these experimental HRV inoculation studies have not demonstrated clinically significant exacerbations, a small decline in pulmonary function has been observed [17, 18] .

On the whole, the distribution and proportion of distinct viral pathogens detected by the Virochip agrees with previous PCR-based analyses of viral pathogens associated with upper RTIs and those accompanied by exacerbation of asthma symptoms [3, 38] . However, Virochip analysis has allowed us to uncover a remarkable amount of diversity among the viral pathogens in this relatively small study population. This diversity indicates that future studies that seek to link a particular virus or set of viruses to a discrete clinical outcome, such as exacerbation of asthma symptoms, will need to include large numbers of subjects and use pan-viral detection methods (such as the Virochip) that can differentiate among such isolates.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 645, "end": 648, "text": "[3,", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 649, "end": 652, "text": "38]", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "Two observations of viral diversity uncovered by Virochip analysis of NL specimens derived from this study are particularly noteworthy. First, the diversity and distribution of HCoVs detected in the present study were surprising. The 2 more recently described HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 were the predominant HCoVs rather than HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-229E, which have been traditionally implicated in up to 15% of common colds in the US adult population [32] . Here, instead we see HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 making up approximately that same proportion of colds detected in our study population. Given that HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 have not been implicated previously as significant players in outpatient respiratory tract illnesses among immunocompetent adults in the United States [39, 40] , these results were unexpected. No HCoV-229E isolates and only a single HCoV-OC43 isolate were detected in this study group, despite the fact that independent studies with the Virochip have demonstrated that, when present, both HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-229E are readily detectable (C. Y. Chiu, A. Urisman, T. L. Greenhow, submitted). Further analysis will be required to determine whether the patterns of HCoVs detected here reflect an increased susceptibility of adults with asthma to contract these HCoVs, the arrival of a local outbreak of these HCoV types, or an actual shift in the prevalence of the distinct HCoVs circulating in the US adult population.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 445, "end": 449, "text": "[32]", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 771, "end": 775, "text": "[39,", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 776, "end": 779, "text": "40]", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "Second, the Virochip detected remarkable and unanticipated diversity among HRV isolates. In addition to detecting almost 30 distinct HRV species closely related to known reference HRV serotypes, we also identified a subgroup of genetically distinct HRVs in a significant fraction (5/37) of the clinical isolates of HRV. Although the clinical significance of HRV diversity remains incompletely understood, the detection of such a high level of genetic divergence among HRV strains captured in this relatively small study population indicates that the standard HRV reference serotypes (which were characterized almost 30 years ago) do not adequately describe the diversity of currently circulating HRVs.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "We do not believe that these HRV'X' strains are an anomalous subgroup of HRVs unique to this study population because (1) a similar proportion of divergent HRV strains were detected by Virochip analysis in an unrelated cohort of pediatric subjects with RTIs (C. Y. Chiu, A. Urisman, T. L. Greenhow, submitted); (2) divergent HRVs have also been recently identified in a study of pediatric respiratory infections in Australia [41] ; (3) based on the 5 noncoding region sequence alone, virtually identical isolates of HRV have been reported in independent analyses of HRV infections among Europeans [42] ; and (4) recent independent application of a distinct pan-viral detection tool, MassTag PCR analysis, has also documented a set of highly diverged HRVs circulating in the US population [43] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 425, "end": 429, "text": "[41]", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 597, "end": 601, "text": "[42]", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 788, "end": 792, "text": "[43]", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "Comparison of the VP4 sequences of the HRV'X' strains identified here suggests that one of the HRV'X' strains (HRV'X'-2) possesses high sequence similarity (98% identity with VP4 sequence DQ875926) to one of the divergent HRVs recently reported by Lamson et al. [43] . However, the VP4 sequences in the other 4 HRV'X' strains identified here possess !85% nucleotide sequence identity with the set of divergent HRVs identified by Lamson et al. [43] . The identification of 2 distinct sets of genetically divergent HRV clinical isolates indicates that the set of previously unrecognized HRVs currently circulating in the United States may be quite large.
