There have been no studies of medical geography of Balkan nephropathy in Romania for the last 40 years and endemic localities are yet to be determined [11] , but the original findings pointed out to hilly areas, with endemic villages laying at the bottom of valleys eroded by flooding, at an altitude of 200-300 m. The endemic region in Bulgaria was described as mountainous or semi-mountainous, without any relationship between endemicity and altitude.

Results were non-convincing and non-reproducible. Inability to identify a single toxic effect of any metal or metalloid as a cause of Balkan nephropathy led researchers to two alternative approaches. First, deficiency, rather than abundance of such a chemical element was proposed [56] , with selenium as the most likely candidate [57] . Second, attention was paid to a combined adverse effect of several elements. Synergism of uranium and some other elements, none of which exceeding maximal allowed levels, was proposed [58] . It was also noted that criteria used in occupational medicine (exposure only during working hours) have been applied to an ecological problem (constant exposure) and that concentrations of lead or cadmium within formally acceptable level, combined with other factors, such as selenium deficiency, might lead to the disease [58] . All these suggestions remained speculative.",

Using these criteria, Danilovi\u0107 suggested classification of patients in field studies into the following groups: 1. potential, a group with intermittent proteinuria, those that fulfill at least the first three criteria, 2. suspected patients, that in addition to the first three fulfill at least one of the remaining three criteria, 3. affected patients, that fulfill at least 5 out of 6 criteria, 4. decompensated patients that fulfill at least 5 out of 6 criteria and have urea values >150 mg% and manifested signs of uremia. Analysis of these criteria leads to the conclusion that they enable detection only of patients with overt disease, and the criteria are not sufficiently specific to enable a reliable diagnosis. Therefore, numerous studies have been focused on developing sufficiently sensitive and specific criteria to enable diagnosis in the early phase. Although markers of tubular disorders, particularly tubular proteinuria , may be used as sufficiently specific diagnostic criteria, so far not a single clinical or laboratory finding is considered pathognomonic for Balkan nephropathy when differentiate it from other, specially, tubulointerstitial diseases.",

Patients from families that were not previously been affected with endemic nephropathy, but live in an endemic village, 2. In cases of nephropathy of unknown etiology in villages close to endemic foci, 3. In immigrants to endemic regions and in emigrants from these regions [111] . Differential diagnosis of Balkan nephropathy should include all chronic, slowly progressive renal diseases, primarily chronic tubulointerstitial diseases. Although no specific indicators of Balkan nephropathy have been recognized, epidemiological data, familial history as well as clinical characteristics of the disease enable differential diagnosis. Thus, shrunken kidneys with smooth surface are characteristic of Balkan nephropathy and they differentiate it from analgesic nephropathy, pyelonephritis or reflux nephropathy that are characterized by shrunken kidneys with uneven surface. Pyelocaliceal system of the kidneys remains unaffected in patients with Balkan nephropathy, unlike the characteristic changes observed in pyelonephritis or obstructive nephropathy . Absence of papillary necrosis/calcifications also enables differentiation of Balkan nephropathy from analgesic, obstructive, reflux nephropathy [110, 115] .",
