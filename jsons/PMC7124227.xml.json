All admitted patients who had positive test results for respiratory virus polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were prospectively identified and monitored until their discharge or release from isolation. Performance of the PCR test for respiratory viruses was at the discretion of the attending physician. Outpatients and patients discharged in the emergency room were not included. Respiratory viruses were detected by multiplex reverse-transcription PCR assay using a Seeplex RV15 ACE Detection kit (Seegene, Seoul, Korea) (January 2012-October 2013) or Anyplex II RV16 Detection kit (Seegene) (November 2013-December 2015). The performance of those PCR kits used in this study has been evaluated in a published study.5 The overall sensitivities of Seeplex RV15 ACE detection kit and Anyplex II RV16 Detection kit were 93.3% and 95.2%, respectively. The specificity of the kits for each virus ranged from 98.6%-100%. These kits simultaneously detect influenza virus A and B, respiratory syncytial virus A and B, parainfluenza virus types 1-4, human metapneumovirus, adenovirus, coronaviruses 229E/NL63 and OC43/HKU1, rhinovirus, and enterovirus.",

Our inclusion of pediatric patients may have been responsible for this. Of note, the influenza virus was responsible for only 13.9% of all hospital-acquired respiratory viral infections. That is, most cases were caused by respiratory viruses other than the influenza virus and which have received much less attention. These findings highlight the importance of year-round surveillance and infection control measures for various respiratory viruses beyond the influenza virus.",

We speculate that increased numbers of prescriptions for PCR tests for hospitalized patients are responsible for this finding. That means that clinicians are increasingly aware of respiratory viral infection as one of the important causes of hospital-acquired infection. The use of more sensitive PCR kits in recent years may also have affected the incidence of respiratory viral infection. However, because the reported sensitivities of the 2 assays (93.3% and 95.2%, respectively) are similar,5 the impact of changes in the PCR kits is not likely to have been substantial. Surprisingly, the incidence of respiratory virus infections was highest in ICUs. Considering the brevity of ICU stays (median, 4 days) before the detection of viruses, it is probable that most of the cases were hospital-acquired lower respiratory tract infections that occurred in wards, not in the ICUs. These findings are consistent with those of a Spanish group, which showed that during the influenza season, 29.5% of critical patients with suspected lower respiratory tract infections had influenza, 42% of which were hospital acquired.10 It has also been reported that respiratory viruses were responsible for 22.5% of cases of severe hospital-acquired pneumonia requiring ICU admission in adults.11 These results strongly suggest that hospital-acquired infections caused by respiratory viruses could lead to serious consequences.",
