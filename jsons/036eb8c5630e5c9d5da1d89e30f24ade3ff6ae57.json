There are also thousands of nursing home patients and those in assisted-living facilities who are being confined to their rooms and not allowed to interact with other residents. This situation is increasing risk for social isolation, which itself has been shown to adversely affect immune function in both animal and human studies, 17,18 thereby increasing risk of infection and adversely affecting the body's response to it.

First, have the person make a list of family members or individuals in their faith community who may be at risk for social isolation or have physical or emotional problems. Contact these individuals and ask if they would like to have a spiritual partner during these unsettling times. Partnering means ensuring that the person has the technology and know-how to connect to others. Next, have the elder contact that person three times/day: in the morning, afternoon, and evening at pre-arranged times. During this time, both partners should pray with the other, encourage the other, and remind the other of God's love for him/her. This will help to relieve the loneliness of both partners and eliminate boredom that is common when confined and alone.",

If an older person is able, one way to put faith into action is by picking up needed supplies at a grocery store or pharmacy, driving to the person's home and leaving the supplies on their doorstep (calling at the time of delivery to ensure immediate pick up). Not everyone can do this, but for those who are physically able, have a car, and some disposable income, this can be one way to lift spirits almost immediately. 6 . Follow by social distancing guidelines. The recommendations above do not mean that elders should be reckless by exposing others (or themselves) to the coronavirus by not following Centers for Disease Control guidelines. 19 Those with symptoms of a cold, especially fever and cough, should avoid close physical contact with others. However, this is easily addressed by reaching out remotely through technology now available (see below). Reckless also means not following the simple steps that can help to prevent the spread of the coronavirus: washing hands regularly with soap for 20 seconds every couple hours, especially after having contact with others or with objects such as Amazon boxes or mail; keeping physical distance from others, and not physically congregating with more than a couple of people at a time. 7. Take advantage of technology. Social distancing means physically separating from one another, not socially separating. A person can be socially close and not physically close, just as one can be physically close and not socially close. 20 Although older adults cannot give physical hugs or handshakes during these times, there are many other ways of providing social and spiritual hugs and handshakes. This can be done remotely by using the technology now available: Skype, FaceTime, Zoom, WebEx, or simply the telephone.",

In summary, advising religious elders to stay in touch with God, focus on spiritual health, maintain good physical health, and help family, friends, and neighbors (remotely through the available technology), will help to boost immunity, develop physical and emotional resistance, and make a difference in the lives of those around them.",
