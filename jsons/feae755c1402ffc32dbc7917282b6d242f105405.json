Youde documents the initial origins of the field as it emerged from concern about infectious diseases and the potential impact on trade from overly restrictive quarantine measures. He captures the important post-World War II rise of the World Health Organization (WHO) as the central agency tasked to deal with international health issues. He covers its success in smallpox eradication and the organization's gradual decline as its core budget remained flat and other actors such as the Global Fund and the Gates Foundation emerged.",

For example, more could be said about the issue area and the scope for cooperation in global health based on the simple fact that actors have a shared interest most of the time in achieving good health outcomes. Unlike other areas, such as environmental protection or security, where actors' interests are often in conflict with each other, most global health issues are ones where states have strong incentives to cooperate, particularly when leadership is provided to overcome collective action problems.",

During this episode, WHO took advantage of ambiguity in its authority to issue a travel warning.

As both Deudney and Youde argue, while framing the environment or health as security threats has the advantage of jumping issues up the queue of attention in policy circles, it potentially comes at a cost. Such a security frame enables governments to pursue extraordinary emergency policies, potentially setting aside normal procedures and also elevating the role of the military in ways that may lead to, as Youde suggests, 'inappropriate responses'.",

However, it is a bit unclear if rhetorical efforts to securitize avian flu, beyond the potential for excessive spending on the issue, were matched by policy action. Indeed, if we look beyond avian flu to other flu pandemics that emerged in the 2000s, US policy appears to have been more measured. In his 2010 report comparing Chinese and US responses with the later H1N1 swine flu epidemic, Yanzhong Huang argues that the Chinese, not the United States, adopted a draconian and ineffective policy that tried to quarantine those suffering from H1N1. Such a policy has much more in common with the emergency securitized approach that Youde critiques. The US approach to swine flu was much more measured relying on early diagnosis and treatment, recognizing that it was too late to quarantine.",

Given the repeated emergence of flu epidemics that potentially could kill larger numbers but have not yet, what is the right balance in attention and spending for these health care threats, particularly as we do not really know how transmissible or lethal they are likely to be until after the outbreak has started?",

First, the Global Fund and PEPFAR, the US bilateral AIDS program, were far and away the most important funding agencies that extended access to antiretroviral drugs. The 3 by 5 effort was an important but time-limited exercise that followed the creation of the Global Fund. Since the WHO was not a funding agency, the campaign was mostly about focusing attention and agenda-setting, but the true success on that score had already been achieved by then UN Secretary General Kofi Annan in 2000 with his call for the creation of a global fund to fight AIDS and finance treatment. Even among WHO-and UNAIDS-led agenda-setting activities, the 3 by 5 initiative was one among several efforts that then UNAIDS director Peter Piot was involved in. His personal role, captured in his 2013 memoir No Time to Lose, might be more important than the institutional legacy of 3 by 5.",

This is a huge and important part of the story that Susan Sell and Aseem Prakash, among others, have written about. When I read the chapter title, I initially thought that it would focus heavily on intellectual property rights and the fight over drug access, which historically has mostly been about HIV/AIDS drugs but is increasingly about pharmaceutical access to fight other diseases such as cancer and hepatitis. That story, about free trade agreements, patents and push back by states and civil society to extend access is on-going and an important part of debates linked to pending initiatives like the Trans-Pacific Partnership and the EU-India bilateral trade deal. While Youde discusses the topic in his chapter on civil society organizations, it is a core part of the story in ARV access.",

The call for greater investment in health systems capacity has a longer history, associated with the original push for basic health care embodied in the 1978 Alma Ata Declaration. Youde writes about Alma Ata and the Health for All agenda, but this discussion could have been more firmly situated in the recurrent vertical versus horizontal debate.",

However, important global health challenges such as the HIV epidemic and the complexities of addressing health issues in an increasingly globalized world have helped to further shape this system.

This book aptly highlights the major trends that have happened in the GHG system in the past two decades; the evolution of a system comprised of mainly state actors and traditional intergovernmental institutions to one with a multitude of actors, including a plethora of non-state actors, many of which did not exist much more than a decade ago. The author discusses some of the forces that have driven these changes as well as some of the important consequences of these trends. He critically assesses the current position of the once dominant WHO and concludes that it has lost most of its traditional power. 'Traditionally, the World Health Organisation (WHO) would be the de facto leader of any such response, but it no longer possesses unquestioned leadership on international health issues', he writes. He argues that one of the factors that has contributed to the WHO's decline is that it has taken on too many mandates, from health promotion to health measurement to even providing guidance on how to build and finance health systems.",

Oddly, arguably the most controversial position of the World Bank in the context of global health, its position on user fees, receives only a passing mention.

Youde also argues that GHG actors lack a unified vision about the rationale for engaging in global health activities. Initially, the rationale for such a system was rooted in the protection of trade but today GHG actors use human security, economics and equity arguments for continued engagement in global health.

The problem is not so much that a hierarchy of diseases exists; the problem is that this hierarchy places on top a disease that rarely affects humans'. It is as though the author is arguing that only the burden of disease should be used to determine disease priority. This argument is weak in many ways. First, it would suggest that much more attention should be placed on high-burden diseases, most notably the non-communicable diseases, which receive nearly no attention in this text.

As an influential piece from 2001 noted, even 20 years into the AIDS pandemic, with resultant effects as great as war or evolution, 'political scientists have devoted little attention to the subject' . Except for those few who studied it, global health scarcely existed as a subject in political and international studies. On the basis of my own conversations with non-US academics, those who studied global health as politics scholars were deemed sociologists or anthropologists in the eyes of the US establishment.",

'Where are malaria (since Bill Gates wants to eradicate it), cholera (since Haiti acquired it from UN blue helmets after the earthquake) or polio (since it keeps breaking out of Pakistan and Nigeria, most recently causing an epidemic in Syria)?' One might be forgiven for thinking this is a fault of Youde, but it tends to be a fault of the academic study of politics than of this work. As Shiffman et al (2009) documented, the rising tide of funding for HIV treatment and prevention has not really raised the metaphorical boats of other global health issues. The same has been mostly true in the multidisciplinary social science examining global health issues: most of the extant research, especially on the politics of health, has focused on HIV/AIDS (the situation has improved somewhat since Boone and Batsell's assessment a dozen years ago). What hasn't focused on HIV has had to contend primarily with political research on infectious diseases, as these seem to be the ones that get the most attention from governments and other international actors.",

The third part of the book, with its case studies, will probably prove of most interest to scholars not specifically interested in health but in governance generally or the specific governance of trade law, intellectual property, international security, human rights and sovereignty. The chapter on the IHR shows the articulation and growth of a regime dedicated to an issue of relatively high importance to most states: preventing the introduction and spread of infectious diseases. The most recent revision of the IHR, in 2005, demonstrates an example of institutional learning. The IHR takes our global experience of HIV, SARS and other zoonotic diseases to devise a system that focuses on information sharing and the form of threats, rather than making specific known diseases reportable. I find the chapter on access to pharmaceuticals to be a succinct yet thorough walk-through of the issues involved, including international intellectual property regimes, the relative power dynamics of developing country governments vis-\u00e0-vis developed world corporations and their associated governments and the moral implications of what Kapstein and Busby (2010) have called 'merit goods'.",

Both groups will profit from absorbing the ideas and scholarship within this book. Even given the relative lack of attention to MNCs, GHG is the most thorough and clearly written consideration of a topic that will only grow in importance in the coming decade or so. At a time when global health governance has become an established field of both policy practice and academic study, Jeremy Youde's book provides a timely and insightful overview of key players and institutions in the field. Moreover, by situating his analysis in the historical context Youde highlights not only the scale of the changes we have seen in the past 20 years, but also how deeply entrenched some of the problems of global health governance are, especially concerning the role of World Health Organization (WHO) and the issue of leadership in global health governance. The book does a great job in bringing the changing patterns of global health governance to light. These patterns are made up partly of the shifting constellation of actors involved in global health governance. Youde's book focuses in particular on WHO and its varying approaches to and role in global health governance, and on some of the new actors involved in global health governance, such as the World Bank, UNAIDS, the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, philanthropic organizations and advocacy NGOs. Partly, the changing patterns of global health governance are created by changing ideas about how health issues are to be understood and which solutions are to be pursued. Youde combines an analysis of these ideas and the contestations about them with a wealth of detailed information about the history and functioning of different organizations. Thus, a picture emerges of a continuously evolving landscape of global health governance with changing groups of players and changing visions for and approaches to global health governance.",

The book shows how these organizations obtained their role in global health governance against the background of the spiraling HIV/AIDS crisis and the inability of existing multilateral institutions to respond to this threat. It acknowledges the important contributions that these new players have made to global public health, but it also points out that concerns have been voiced about private actors taking on governance functions, and that these organizations have not always had an easy relationship with governmental actors.",

            "text": "The myriad of different types of private actors involved in global health governance today makes it sometimes difficult to categorize them. This difficulty may be a reason for what I feel is a slightly awkward choice of chapter titles. The chapter on philanthropic organizations is titled 'Private Actors', while the chapter on Oxfam and TAC is titled 'Civil Society Organizations'. Yet, civil society organizations are private actors too, and one might even argue that philanthropic organizations are part of civil society given that they advocate for social causes and work on a non-forprofit basis. Furthermore, with regard to the role of private actors in global health governance, a more substantial discussion of the pharmaceutical industry may have been useful. Pharmaceutical companies have become key players in global health governance, particularly in the last two decades, as governments and global health initiatives have promoted the increased availability of drugs and vaccines in a wide range of policy areas, including health, development and security. This trend is manifest in the rise of global financing and procurement organizations, such as GAVI and the Global Fund, public private partnerships to develop drugs and vaccines for neglected diseases, such as DNDi and the Global TB Alliance, pandemic preparedness initiatives, such as the WHO Global Action Plan for Influenza Vaccines (GAP), and anti-bioterrorism measures, such as the US Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), which partners with pharmaceutical companies for the development of medical countermeasures. Pharmaceutical companies have become key players in global health governance not only because they produce most of the medicines and vaccines that governments and global health initiatives seek to make available, but also because they often work as partners with these organizations and frequently sit of the governing boards of public-private partnerships. In other words, pharmaceutical companies have taken on governance functions in global health governance and, therefore, are key players not only in the economics but also in the politics of global health. Jeremy Youde's book explicitly focuses on the global governance of infectious diseases as these diseases have so far received most political attention and resources. The focus of the book is a great advantage because it allows the author to discuss important actors and policy issues in detail and explore the material and ideational politics surrounding them. It is clearly justified also because the most visible structures of global health governance have developed to fight infectious diseases, notably HIV/AIDS, influenza, malaria, tuberculosis and other emerging and reemerging infectious diseases. Yet, any focus means that other issues fade into the background. And while focus is necessary, especially when writing a book, I would like to highlight two issues that may help situate the book in wider debates about and developments in global (health) governance.",

Most of the organizations discussed in the book, such as the World Bank, the Global Fund, the Gates Foundation, CHAI, Oxfam and TAC, work on health in developing countries. From this perspective it looks like global health governance was in fact the global governance of health in developing countries. And indeed, most global health governance organizations that have emerged in the past 20 years address health issues in developing countries. Partly, this is the result of their work concentrating on infectious diseases, which are more prevalent in developing countries than in high-income countries. Partly, the focus of global health governance on health in developing countries is the result of a successful framing that has linked health to development. As a consequence, most governments label expenditures for global health as development assistance for health. The implicit focus of the book on the global governance of health in developing countries is therefore a reflection of a focus that has emerged in global health governance in the past 20 years.",

On the one hand, there is the claim of institutions and policies being global; on the other hand, there is the reality of financing and, therefore, decision making being done largely by a small group of governments and philanthropic organizations based in Europe and North America. Second, a global governance system that is based on donor-recipient dynamics is prone to questions of sustainability. Many donor governments have accepted that health is key to development and that health threats in developing countries can become a security issue for their own populations. Yet, the rewards for donor governments of investing in health in developing countries are indirect at best, and donor fatigue has become a growing phenomenon. Finally, the current model of global health governance in which a small group of governments and organizations carry most of the costs for health interventions in developing countries is outdated given the economic growth in middleincome countries and the rapidly shifting power relations in the global political economy. These issues shape the politics of global health governance. Making them more explicit may help working toward a system that is substantially 'global' and toward governance structures that provide global public goods rather than development assistance for health.",

The agreements establish a range of legally binding requirements for the protection of patents and other intellectual property rights. These, in turn, can shape the prices of medicines and vaccines and thereby their affordability and availability. International trade agreements therefore set a framework of rules within which global health governance has to operate when considering policies to improve access to medical treatment across the globe. In addition, international law enforcement agencies, such as Interpol and the World Customs Organization also shape global health governance. These organizations are involved in the implementation and, to some extent, definition of standards on counterfeit medicines and, thereby, influence an important debate in global health governance, namely how to ensure medicine safety. Global health and the governance thereof is furthermore affected by various environmental treaties. For instance, the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety on the Convention on Biological Diversity sets norms for the control of imports of genetically modified organisms (GMOs), including on health grounds.

It is therefore important to focus both policy and scholarly efforts on how to improve global governance for health. Yet, in order to better understand how to improve global governance for health we may have to better understand how the global governance of health is operating today. Jeremy Youde's book makes an important contribution in this endeavor and is rapidly becoming a key resource for scholars and students alike. director would frequently make us record ourselves and then listen back to the results later. That exercise often filled me with dread ahead of time because I worried about the mistakes I would discover (and there were plenty), but it made me a better player.

Over the past decade, we have witnessed the beginning of the emergence of a genuine canon of seminal articles and books, such as , Davies (2010) , Elbe (2006 ), Fidler (1998 , Lee (2009), McInnes and Rushton (2010) and Price-Smith (2001 ), among many others. These pieces have provided a solid foundation for understanding the shifting dynamics within the international community on regulating and reacting to transnational health issues. We have moved from a situation where health languished in the realm of 'low politics' (Fidler 2005, p. 180) , considered almost entirely a technocratic issue and receiving little attention from international policymakers, to one where governments and the United Nations actively debate whether infectious disease constitutes a threat to national and international security. We have recognized the growing plurality of actors who take an active role in contributing to the international community's global health responses. We have acknowledged the incredibly political nature of how, when, where and whether coordinated global responses to health concerns will emerge. These are significant advancesboth for the global health literature and for the larger international relations literature.",

With all of the changes in the issues on the global health agenda, who was involved with it, and how the international community funded it, the time seemed right for a book that could aim to identify all the moving parts that co-existed within this realm of global health governance. In particular, I wanted to write a book that would be accessible to non-specialist audiences, but still be useful to global health politics scholars. Another driving factor was the emergence of a growing number of undergraduate and graduate courses and programs in global health politics. As these courses proliferate, I wanted to write a book that could help students identify some of the key issues, important actors and relevant history in how the current global health governance system evolved. My hope was to help fill a gap and provide a jumping-off point for future research. Underscoring the need for such a book, Sophie Harman and I were working on books on global health governance at the same time and our books came out within a few months of each other. Harman's (2011) Global Health Governance is a truly excellent introduction to many of the important issues in global health governance, and one that I have used in my own classes. Our books take slightly different analytical foci and highlight different issues, allowing them to complement each other quite nicely.",

I understand the point she makes about the vitality of preparation and prevention. Disease surveillance systems are designed to highlight the new and novel, and that makes absolute sense for a whole host of reasons. My intention was not necessarily to argue against that strategy. Rather, I wanted to tie it in with larger questions raised by the surveillance requirements within the 2005 revised version of the International Health Regulations, often abbreviated as IHR (2005) (World Health Organization, 2008). IHR (2005) jettisoned the old reporting requirements and their focus on specifically enumerated diseases, instead embracing an all-risks approach that required states be vigilant for any public health emergency of international concern. This new approach requires states to establish and maintain a fairly robust disease surveillance system, which should benefit all of us. The objections raised are not on public health grounds, but rather on political and economic grounds. IHR (2005) came with no funding to support the more extensive surveillance requirements within the treaty. In a number of countries, this has led to debates over how the government should allocate its limited public health budget. Policymakers have asked whether establishing a surveillance system is the most effective use of their limited resources or are responsive to the needs of the people. Again, this is not so much a public health debate as it is a debate at the intersection of public health and politics.",

Is PepsiCo's involvement in groups like the Global Health Council a sign of its recognition of corporate social responsibility, or is it an attempt to deflect attention from its own culpability for growing rates of obesity and diabetes (Boseley, 2014) ? Do programs like Product (RED), in which a portion of the sales from specially branded products go toward the purchase of antiretroviral drugs in Africa, allow consumers to 'vote with their dollars', or are they cynical marketing efforts that fail to address the underlying causes of Africa's HIV/AIDS epidemic (Richey and Ponte, 2011) ? Is it possible that multinational corporations (MNCs) could contribute positively to global health governance, or is their presence necessarily a distortion of the global health agenda for private gain over public benefit? I have looked at some of these issues in previous research (Youde, 2009b) , and I tried to address some of these issues by looking at the role of private philanthropic organizations, but they clearly deserve greater attention. Paxton and Roemer-Mahler, both highlight the need to investigate where MNCs fit within global health governance. Paxton raises a number of ways in which MNCs have taken an active role in global health governance without receiving much attention. Pharmaceutical companies could theoretically be partners for promoting drug access, but Busby notes that they can also distort markets and insist upon intellectual property rights protections that keep people from getting the drugs they need. MNCs could help fill some of the budgetary gaps facing the World Health Organization (WHO), but would they restrict how their contributions could be used? That could distort WHO's agendabut it is important to remember that WHO's agenda is already significantly distorted by the extrabudgetary funds given by wealthy nations for specific purposes. Although I cannot resolve these questions here, the fact that these questions exist shows that they need to figure far more prominently in any future versions of this book.",

As she points out, this framing raises questions about aid dependency, issue distortion and ties with other elements of global governance. The relationships with other elements of global governance are important, but I found that I could not do them justice within the scope of this current book. (This is one area where Harman (2011) particularly excels). I would agree with her assessment that my book implicitly accepts equating global health governance with global health governance in developing countries. This is simply a reflection, for better or worse, of how the current mode of global health governance has evolved. The focus on infectious diseases and on (initially) framing global health as a security issue have led to a system where we tend to pay attention to illnesses in developing countries not out of altruistic concerns, but out of fears that they could cross borders and threaten the West. By reflecting this system, my aim was not to signal approval or disapproval, but rather show what currently exists. This same logic extends to the relative lack of attention in the book to noncommunicable diseases (NCDs), which Busby highlights. While development assistance for health in 2011 totaled approximately US$31 billion, NCDs received only $377 millionslightly over 1 per cent of the total (Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, 2014, p. 10). The international community is starting to pay more attention to NCDs, but the global health governance system is still largely oriented toward infectious diseases, and it is uncertain how much or whether the system will need to evolve to accommodate NCDs.",

I am a big fan of the work by both Sandler and Barrett on international health cooperation and cited it quite a bit in one of my earlier books (Youde, 2009a) , though I did not really address their research in this book. The broader questions about the conditions under which states turn to IOs and whether IOs actually possess autonomous power of their own could be fruitfully explored and deserve greater attention in a future version of this book, though. He also suggests a more extensive discussion of horizontal and vertical programming. The global health governance system has largely organized around disease-specific vertical programs, but recent calls for a Framework Convention on Global Health (Gostin, 2008) and debates about the post-Millennium Development Goals agenda may suggest the emergence of space for an international discussion of supporting programs that aim to strengthen health systems at large.",
