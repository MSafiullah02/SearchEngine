            "text": "RIG-I is expressed at a low level in most cells of the body and its abundance increases in response to IFN. In non-infected cells RIG-I is found in a resting state with the RD covering the RNA-binding and helicase domains (Saito et al., 2007). CARDs of \u2018resting\u2019 RIG-I are also folded over one another with these interactions governing the signaling activity of RIG-I (\nFig. 1(1)) (Kowalinski et al., 2011). Following recognition of PAMP RNA, RIG-I hydrolyzes ATP and undergoes a conformational change which opens the RNA binding domain for closer interaction with PAMP RNA while releasing the CARDs for MAVS interaction and signaling (Fig. 1(2)) (Jiang et al., 2011, Kowalinski et al., 2011). The hydrolysis of ATP also facilitates translocation of RIG-I along the RNA, thus making room for other RIG-I proteins to oligomerize onto the PAMP molecule (Patel et al., 2013). RIG-I is then modified with ubiquitin at N-terminal sites by the TRIM25 protein thus allowing CARD\u2013CARD tetramers to form in the presence of ubiquitin (Gack et al., 2007, Gack et al., 2008). For sustained activation, RIG-I interacts with the dsRNA binding protein PACT, which binds to the C-terminal domain of RIG-I aiding in ATP hydrolysis to maintain the protein in an active state (Kok et al., 2011). Interactions with zinc antiviral protein short isoform (ZAPS) also maintain RIG-I in an activated state (Hayakawa et al., 2011). As shown in Fig. 1, the entire complex then translocates from the cytoplasm to the mitochondrial associated membrane (MAM) facilitated by the 14-3-3\u03b5 protein to chaperone the RIG-I \u2018translocase\u2019 to the MAM (Liu et al., 2012). At the MAM, RIG-I CARDs interact with the MAVS CARD, catalyzing filament formation of MAVS which in turn activates TBK1 and IKK\u03b5 to initiate downstream signaling (Fig. 1(4)) (Hou et al., 2011). It is still unclear whether the RNA PAMP ligand translocates to the MAM still bound to RIG-I or if it is released upon CARD tetramer formation. Moreover, it should be noted that though MAVS filaments have been identified in cell-free extracts, their formation and presence have not been demonstrated in intact mammalian cells in the context of virus infection (Hou et al., 2011). It is also noted that LGP2 which lacks CARDs is thought to negatively regulate RIG-I through interactions of the RD (Komuro et al., 2008, Komuro and Horvath, 2006, Saito et al., 2007), while other studies indicate a positive regulatory role for LGP2 in RLR signaling (Bruns et al., 2014, Goubau et al., 2014, Satoh et al., 2010). Much work has been focused on understanding the regulation of RLR signaling pathway by various host proteins and is reviewed elsewhere (Chiang et al., 2014, Eisenacher and Krug, 2012, Komuro et al., 2008).",

            "text": "RIG-I recognizes PAMP RNA ligands based on a level of specificity in terms of sequence composition, PAMP motif length, ss or dsRNA, and the presence of 5\u2032 cap versus exposed 5\u2032triphosphate (5\u2032ppp). 5\u2032 capped RNA does not trigger RIG-I signaling nor does RNA lacking exposed 5\u2032ppp or 5\u2032 diphosphosphate (5\u2032pp) (\nFig. 2). dsRNA of <300 base pairs with blunt ends containing a 5\u2032ppp moiety are ideal ligands for RIG-I, although the minimal length has been shown to be 10 base pairs as long as no mismatches exist near the blunt end (Hornung et al., 2006, Kato et al., 2006, Kato et al., 2008, Pichlmair et al., 2006, Schmidt et al., 2009). RNA panhandle or bulge/loop structures are stimulatory if the RNA contains 5\u2032ppp and blunted 5\u2032 end (Marq et al., 2010). However, recent studies have also reported RIG-I binding and activity in the presence of RNA containing 5\u2032pp moiety (Goubau et al., 2014, Lu et al., 2010). It is possible that a significant difference in the on\u2013off rate of the PAMP RNA binding to RIG-I containing different 5\u2032 moieties could explain this discrepancy (Lu et al., 2010, Wang et al., 2010). Two significant crystal structures have been solved to reveal how RIG-I binds to different RNA species and has provided insights into the conformational changes required for signaling (Jiang et al., 2011, Luo et al., 2011). RIG-I has also been shown to recognize specific sequences found in viral genomes, such as the poly-U/UC motif found in the 3\u2032 untranslated region of hepatitis C virus or the mRNA of the N gene of Hantaan virus (Fig. 2) (Lee et al., 2011, Runge et al., 2014, Saito et al., 2008, Schnell et al., 2012). Some controversy exists surrounding the ability of RIG-I to bind to single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) synthesized using the T7 polymerase, which has a tendency to add a short double-stranded copy-back section to 5\u2032ppp ssRNA (Cazenave and Uhlenbeck, 1994). When one such ssRNA was purified to remove any contaminating dsRNA, it failed to stimulate RIG-I dependent signaling in vitro (Marq et al., 2010, Schlee et al., 2009). However, production of 5\u2032ppp RNA itself by T7 polymerase is not sufficient to produce a PAMP. Such transcripts produced from a variety of templates do not induce RIG-I signaling (Cui et al., 2008, Saito et al., 2008, Schnell et al., 2012). Thus, despite a number of high resolution crystal structures and excellent reports describing structural and sequence determinants for RIG-I ligands, the true definition of a RIG-I ligand remains controversial. The field has collected a large amount of information about what RNA structures or sequences may be beneficial for RIG-I binding and what may be sufficient for RIG-I signaling, but it remains difficult to predict RIG-I binding sequences and stimulatory RNA motifs based on structure and sequence. Defining PAMP ligands of RIG-I thus requires a comprehensive assessment of direct binding to RIG-I, PAMP stimulation of RIG-I ATPase activity and conformation change, as well as ability of PAMP stimulation to drive the cytosol-to-MAM translocation of RIG-I to mediate MAVS interaction and downstream intracellular signaling. The following sections provide an overview of RIG-I interaction with viruses from different genera that reveal shared and unique features of RIG-I interaction among diverse virus families.",

The importance of the pro-inflammatory response in controlling Ebola virus (EBOV) infection was demonstrated by pre-activation of RIG-I in cells by treatment with RIG-I agonist RNA prior to virus challenge. These cells were then resistant to EBOV infection (Spiropoulou et al., 2009). Because stimulation of RIG-I leads to a general pro-inflammatory response through induction of IFNs, it is not clear what specific cellular antiviral effector mechanisms were responsible for the protection against EBOV observed in this study. Moreover, EBOV has been shown to encode an innate immune antagonist protein, VP35. This viral protein was first identified as an antagonist of IFN induction (Basler et al., 2000). Subsequent reports have suggested possible mechanisms for this inhibition including sequestration of viral dsRNA through interactions with the VP35 RNA binding domain that prevent PAMP recognition by RIG-I (Cardenas et al., 2006), inhibition of phosphorylation of IRF3/7 through interactions with TBK1 (Basler et al., 2003, Hartman et al., 2008, Prins et al., 2009), and direct interaction with RIG-I to suppress RIG-I signaling activity (Luthra et al., 2013). While these studies suggest that EBOV dsRNA might harbor PAMP motifs for RIG-I recognition and innate immune signaling, the potential for RIG-I actually sensing the EBOV genome has yet to be directly examined. It is possible that the dsRNA sequestered by VP35 would trigger RLR signaling activation during infection but the absolute nature of this putative PAMP is not known (Ramanan et al., 2012).",

            "text": "RIG-I, as well as MDA5, has been reported to induce IFN following infection of human cells with measles virus (Ikegame et al., 2010). The viral leader transcript of the measles virus has been identified as a potential PAMP ligand of RIG-I (Fig. 2) (Plumet et al., 2007). However, during viral infection, limited IFN is detected in the supernatant of infected cells, suggesting that measles virus may antagonize RIG-I signaling actions. Originally, the V proteins of paramyxoviruses were identified as MDA5 antagonists, preventing its activation and thereby suppressing innate immune signaling during infection (Childs et al., 2007, Childs et al., 2009, Lo et al., 2012, Motz et al., 2013). Interestingly, a recent study shows that a single amino acid difference between RLRs determines the ability of paramyxovirus V proteins to suppress MDA5 versus RIG-I (Rodriguez and Horvath, 2013). In 2012, Childs et al. (2012) reported that the V protein of the related parainfluenzavirus type 5 (PIV5) interacts with LGP2 to regulate the activation of RIG-I. They reported a synergism between PIV5 V protein and LGP2 to inhibit RIG-I activation when cells were exposed to known RIG-I PAMP ligands. Childs et al. (2012) demonstrated that interaction between LGP2 and RIG-I occurred only in the presence of PIV5 V protein and not the P protein, suggesting that LGP2 inhibition of RIG-I was a result of V protein interference. However, others reported no inhibitor effect on RIG-I activity in the presence of physiologically relevant levels of V proteins from measles virus and PIV5 (Rodriguez and Horvath, 2014). Because LGP2 can regulate RIG-I and MDA5 in opposing ways, it has been difficult to tease out the importance of LGP2 interference with RIG-I activation and innate immune stimulation by paramyxovirus V protein interactions. Thus, further studies are warranted to define the role of LGP2 for RLR and innate immune regulation in paramyxovirus infection.",

While the exact RNA PAMP of VSV that is recognized and bound by RIG-I to initiate the innate immune response is not known, sequence similarity of the 5\u2032 leader segment of the VSV genome to other known viral RIG-I ligands suggests that this may be a stimulatory RNA motif (Saito et al., 2008).",

Arteriviruses are actually positive-sense RNA viruses. Arteriviruses were shown to be primarily recognized by MDA5 in MEFs (van Kasteren et al., 2012). However Arteriviruses encode a deubiquitinase (DUB) activity within their nonstructural protein 2 (nsp2) that serves to catalyze the removal of ubiquitin chains from MDA5 (and RIG-I) that otherwise facilitate RLR activation. This process results in attenuation of MDA5 signaling and overall suppression of downstream IRF3 nuclear localization and IFN-\u03b2 expression, thus supporting viral replication and spread (Luo et al., 2008). Innate immune evasion was linked to the nsp2 of porcine respiratory and reproductive syndrome virus (PRRSV), which was sufficient to inhibit virus-induced IRF3 activation when expressed in target cells (Li et al., 2010a). Viral DUB activity is conserved among arterivirus strains and is linked with pathogenesis (van Kasteren et al., 2012).",

Marq et al. (2010) demonstrated that the 5\u2032 RNA overhang resulting from this \u2018prime and realign\u2019 mechanism of replication significantly decreases IFN-\u03b2 expression compared to RNA with no overhang. Further, the mismatched base pairings could also contribute to a reduction in innate immune signaling and elimination of the 5\u2032ppp completely eliminated IFN-\u03b2 expression (Marq et al., 2010). Ligand competition assays revealed that the 5\u2032ppp overhang RNA acted as a sink for RIG-I, holding it tightly, but not allowing for subsequent signaling (Marq et al., 2011). In this way, it is thought that arenaviruses are recognized by RIG-I and that they are able to actively antagonize RIG-I signaling to evade the innate immune response.",

The Z proteins of new world arenaviruses, but not old world arenaviruses, were shown to co-localize with RIG-I and could co-immunoprecipitate RIG-I in vitro (Fan et al., 2010). This association with RIG-I was sufficient to block RIG-I\u2013MAVS interactions and NF-\u03baB and IRF3 activation. However, most human infections with pathogenic arenaviruses are known to involve high levels of IFN expression and pro-inflammatory cytokines. Thus, RIG-I antagonism must be incomplete during the course of in vivo infection.

Hantaviruses are transmitted by respiratory route while phleboviruses are transmitted by the bite of an insect vector (Horne and Vanlandingham, 2014). The hantavirus genome consists of three negative-sense, single-stranded genome segments which form blunt-ended panhandle structures containing a 5\u2032 monophosphate (5\u2032p) motif (Garcin et al., 1995, Wang et al., 2011). Studies of hantavirus revealed that this 5\u2032p motif prevents RIG-I recognition of the genomic RNA (Habjan et al., 2008, Wang et al., 2011). However, during infection, RIG-I is required for innate immune signaling (Lee et al., 2011). Lee et al. (2011) demonstrated that the viral N gene from Hantaan virus (an Old World hantavirus) could serve as a ligand for RIG-I when transfected in a mammalian expression vector, suggesting that viral mRNAs could serve as the stimulatory RNA in hantavirus infection. The authors concluded that the mRNA from the N gene contained double-stranded RNA recognized by RIG-I because co-transfection of the N gene with the E3 gene from Vaccinia virus, which sequesters dsRNA, resulted in ablation of innate signaling (Fig. 2) (Lee et al., 2011). Further elucidation of the structural motif recognized by RIG-I should complement similar studies to determine whether other hantavirus mRNAs are also recognized by RIG-I, and the elucidate the role of 5\u2032 phosphates in this process.",

However, nairoviruses, like arterviruses, encode DUB enzymes that deubiquitinate RIG-I to prevent innate immune signaling activation (van Kasteren et al., 2012), suggesting that during nairovirus infection/replication a PAMP, likely a viral transcription product, is produced that can activate RIG-I.

            "text": "The Orthomyxoviridae include Influenza A, B, and C viruses. The viruses harbor a negative sense multi-segmented single stranded RNA genome. Influenza A virus (IAV) encodes 8 genome segments and represents the major epidemic and pandemic virus of past and recent time (Iwasaki and Pillai, 2014, Palese, 2004). IAV is maintained in water fowl and other avian species and is typically transmitted among encounters of domestic water fowl or chickens with pigs and humans wherein reassortment of viral genome segments in pigs co-infected with multiple IAV strains can result in new viruses. When exposed to humans, these new viruses cause contemporary seasonal epidemics or in the worst outcome creates an IAV pandemic strain against which the human population has little or no pre-existing immunity (Palese, 2004). Induction of an innate immune response by IAV occurs differentially among strains owing to the fact that the virus directs a variety of host response evasion strategies that impose limitations on host cell gene expression, including 5\u2032 cap snatching activity, transcriptional regulation, and evasion of RIG-I activation of innate immune signaling (Schmolke and Garcia-Sastre, 2010). Early studies revealed that the viral nonstructural protein NS1 could direct evasion of IFN induction and host defenses during early infection through direct interference or indirectly via interference with host mRNA processing (Garcia-Sastre et al., 1998). Since then Pichlmair et al. (2006) demonstrated that RIG-I recognizes 5\u2032ppp genomic ssRNA from IAV during infection (Fig. 2). This was the first demonstration, that RIG-I could recognize both dsRNA and ssRNA in a virus infection albeit via 5\u2032ppp. Further studies identified the 3\u2032 nontranslated region of the viral genome as a ligand for RIG-I independent of the 5\u2032-ppp wherein lariat structure of the viral RNA end provides a substrate for recognition by RIG-I (Davis et al., 2012). The IAV non-structural protein NS1 was shown to antagonize RIG-I signaling (Mibayashi et al., 2007) and further shown to form a complex with RIG-I to suppress its function (Pichlmair et al., 2006). This complex formation blocks TRIM25 ubiquitin E3 ligase-mediated Lys63-linked ubiquitination of RIG-I, which is required for downstream signaling (Rajsbaum et al., 2012). Interestingly, this inhibition by NS1 is species specific, suggesting that this activity may be one of many required adaptations for host-species jump of influenza viruses (Rajsbaum et al., 2012). Malur et al. (2012) showed that NS1 from IAV strains that induce RIG-I activation can co-opt LGP2 for inhibition of RIG-I signaling.",

This replication could be enhanced through addition of bronchial lavages from wild-type infected mice, indicating that a robust interferon and pro-inflammatory responses may be helpful for viral replication. Indeed, the authors demonstrated that TLR7 and MAVS-dependent signaling is required to recruit monocyte-derived DCs to the lung and that these cells serve as target cells for viral infection (Pang et al., 2013). Thus, a careful balance between inflammatory signals that restrict viral infection and sustained inflammation that enhances viral replication may determine IAV infection outcome in humans.",

However, the respective roles of each RLR in recognition and innate immune activation were not defined. It remains possible that each RLR is essential for recognition of viral RNA at distinct stages during the infection as has been described for West Nile virus (WNV) infection (Errett et al., 2013). Because the coronavirus genomic RNA contains a 5\u2032 cap moiety known to block RIG-I recognition of RNA, it is likely that replication intermediates or negative sense subgenomic RNAs and not genome/virion RNA serve as the stimulatory RNA for RIG-I during infection while MDA5 may recognize the replicating genome dsRNA products.",

Of interest is that the flaviviruses are recognized as nonself in the vertebrate host through the actions of both RIG-I and MDA5. Errett et al.

The WNV virion RNA contains a 5\u2032cap which is expected to mask the 5\u2032ppp required for RIG-I recognition (Fields et al., 2013).

Loo et al. describe incomplete signal suppression in cells lacking either RIG-I or MDA5, while DENV-induced innate immune signaling was completely lost in cells lacking both RLRs. Thus, both PRRs could be responsible for innate immune signaling during acute DENV infection, perhaps operating in temporally distinct fashion as in WNV infection (Loo et al., 2008). Similarly, Nasirudeen et al. (2011) observed measurable IFN\u03b2 production in individual knockdowns for RIG-I, MDA5, and TLR3, but triple knockdown cells completely lost all innate immune signal during DENV infection. DENV, like the other flaviviruses, has not been shown to antagonize the RLR signaling pathway directly but has been shown to antagonize the IFN signaling JAK\u2013STAT pathway through degradation of STAT2 and other means recently reviewed in Green et al.

However, hepaciviruses are not arboviruses but instead are transmitted among humans via parenteral exposure to blood or blood products (Hajarizadeh et al., 2013). Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is the major human pathogen in this virus family, which also includes the related GB viruses (GBV), GBV-C through GBV-D, that do not cause disease in humans (Fields et al., 2013, Stapleton et al., 2011). In 2005 RIG-I was identified as an essential host factor that mediates the recognition of HCV RNA in hepatoma cell lines wherein RIG-I serves to recognize and bind to the 3\u2032 nontranslated region of the HCV RNA (Sumpter et al., 2005). This discovery was followed with identification of the viral poly-uridine/cytosine (poly-U/UC) motif in the 3\u2032 nontranslated region together with 5\u2032ppp of the viral genome as the HCV PAMP (Fig. 2) (Saito et al., 2008, Uzri and Gehrke, 2009). The poly-U/UC PAMP motif is marked by a U-core region that typically includes 17 or more poly-U nucleotides that are essential for PAMP recognition such that U-core length and 5\u2032ppp are critical determinants of PAMP activity and recognition of HCV RNA by RIG-I (Schnell et al., 2012). When introduced in cells the poly-U/UC motif was shown to trigger RIG-I signaling of innate immune defenses that could suppress HCV infection (Saito et al., 2008). The induction of innate immunity by RIG-I signaling is countered however during HCV infection through the actions of the viral nonstructural (NS)3/4A protease that targets and cleaves MAVS to suppress RIG-I signaling (Foy et al., 2003, Loo et al., 2006). HCV most often mediates a chronic infection in people acutely exposed to the virus, and NS3/4A cleavage of MAVS to inactivate the RIG-I pathway has been linked to chronic infection progression in models of HCV infection (Horner et al., 2012). The structural requirements of RIG-I recognition of the HCV poly-U/UC and the viral mechanisms of innate immune evasion have been thoroughly reviewed previously (Horner, 2014, Horner and Gale, 2013).",

Togaviridae members are enveloped, positive sense ssRNA viruses. Transcriptional profiling of human cells infected with alphaviruses, such as Chikungunya (CHIKV) and Sindbis (SINV) viruses, has shown a significant transcriptional upregulation of innate immune signaling genes, while host translation is shut off by the nsP2 viral protein to prevent protein production (Frolova et al., 2002) To determine the source of pathogen recognition, Burke et al. (2009) investigated IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 production in murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) following infection with a mutant SINV unable to prevent host protein synthesis. Infection in WT MEFs with the mutant SINV led to IFN production. MDA5\u2212/\u2212 MEFs produced 2-fold less IFN following infection with mutant SINV compared to WT MEFs (Burke et al., 2009). In contrast, RIG\u2212/\u2212 MEFs produced significantly increased levels of IFN following mutant SINV infection. While Burke et al. (2009) conclude that these results indicate an important role for MDA5 in SINV recognition and signaling, they acknowledge the possibility that RIG-I exerts a significant restriction on SINV replication which would also explain these results. White et al. (2011) demonstrated that infection of human fibroblasts with CHIKV induces IRF3 dimerization and nuclear localization that is MAVS-dependent, consistent with MDA5 or RIG-I activation during infection. Further elucidation of the viral region recognized by either RIG-I or MDA5 and finer resolution of the roles of each PRR are necessary to determine the nature of pathogen recognition for the Togaviridae.",

The 10 genomic segments of the reovirus genome form blunt-ended hairpin structures but were thought to evade recognition by RIG-I by encoding a phosohohydrolase that trims the 5\u2032ppp to 5\u2032 diphosphate (pp) (Fields et al., 2013). However, a recent report by Goubau et al. (2014) describes RIG-I recognition and activation induced by reovirus RNA in vitro, and reveal that MAVS signaling is important for viral control in vivo. This study demonstrated that 5\u2032pp can serve as a recognition motif of PAMP RNA (Fig. 2). Although RIG-I signaling was evident in response to 5\u2032pp RNA treatment, the magnitude of RIG-I-induced IFN production was significantly greater following treatment with 5\u2032ppp compared to 5\u2032pp RNA. Thus, while viral phosohohydrolase activity to render 5\u2032pp reduces RIG-I signaling of innate immunity during reovirus infection, it does not prevent PAMP recognition such that innate immune signaling remains active but attenuated. The physiological relevance of differential RIG-I signaling in response to 5\u2032ppp versus 5\u2032pp motifs remains unclear in terms of immune response induction and host control of virus infection.",

            "text": "PAMP recognition and pathogen recognition receptor signaling and pathways inside the infected cell have profound effects on cell survival, the control of cell to cell virus spread, and the onset of effective host immunity. Often PRR signaling directs major alterations in gene expression of the infected cell, thus programming the cell for virus restriction or cell death. Additionally, PRR signaling does not occur in isolation, but instead viral products trigger a variety of cell signaling pathways that mediate crosstalk with one another to direct synergistic or antagonistic actions toward controlling infection (Loo and Gale, 2011). For example, RLR activation can function together with TLR3 signaling leading to enhanced HLA-I cross-presentation of antigen by dendritic cells (Lalwani et al., 2013). In contrast, activation of the RLR pathway by poly(I:C) or 5\u2032ppp RNA was shown to suppress TLR-mediated transcription of IL12b during bacterial infection (Negishi et al., 2012). This RLR signaling attenuated TH1 and TH17 responses leading to decreased survival of mice treated with a sublethal dose of Lysteria monocytogenes. Such crosstalk may explain how viral infection can exacerbate the symptoms of other microbial infections. Other in vivo models of RNA virus infection have also revealed the ability of the RLR pathway to program adaptive T cell responses. Utilizing various RLR pathway knockout animals has shown that CD4 and CD8 T cell responses can be severely dysregulated in both a cell extrinsic and cell intrinsic manner (Lazear et al., 2013, Suthar et al., 2010). Moreover, RNA virus infection has been shown to induce inflammasome activation through MAVS (Delaloye et al., 2009, Ermler et al., 2014, Pothlichet et al., 2013). Poeck et al. (2010) revealed that RIG-I may interact in a MAVS-dependent manner with CARD9 and Bcl-10 to activate NF-\u03baB for transcription of IL-1\u03b2 and other factors involved in inflammasome activation and onset of the inflammatory response to virus infection. In addition, MAVS has been shown to interact with NLRP3 and direct association with the MAM and facilitate NLRP3 oligomerization leading to caspase-1 activation and release of mature IL-1\u03b2 to drive the inflammatory response (Park et al., 2013). Regulation of apoptosis and inflammasome-induced cell death or pyroptosis through RLR/MAVS-dependent activation of the inflammasome may have evolved as a mechanism to prevent viral spread and induce a robust pro-inflammatory immune response, thus linking innate antiviral immunity with inflammatory signaling and responses that control virus infection.",

A number of groups have already explored the use of RIG-I agonists to prevent viral infection. RIG-I activation using 5\u2032ppp RNA can restrict viral infection when treatment occurs before or after virus challenge in vitro and in vivo (Chen et al., 2013, Han et al., 2011, Spiropoulou et al., 2009). Others have already developed RIG-I agonists which can activate the pro-inflammatory response in the absence of stimulatory RNA (Goulet et al., 2013, Han et al., 2011), and small molecule RIG-I agonists are being developed as antivirals to suppress RNA virus infection (Bedard et al., 2012). These studies present proof of concept that stimulation of a specific innate immune responses alone or combined with the presentation of viral antigen or targeted vaccine design could lead to broad spectrum antiviral strategies as therapy for RNA virus infection, as well as providing adjuvant actions for enhancement of RNA virus vaccines.",

The innate antiviral immune response initiated by RIG-I activation serves to program a specific adaptive immune response effective against RNA viruses. In addition, cross-talk between the RLR pathway and other cellular PRR pathways can skew the host response towards tolerance or defense against invading pathogens. RIG-I plays a key role in the defense against RNA viruses from broad genera. RNA viruses have evolved mechanisms for either evading recognition by RIG-I or active antagonism of RIG-I signaling (\nTable 1). However, beyond 5\u2032ppp the characteristics of RIG-I ligands remain poorly understood. Future studies must focus on defining the specific RNA species, sequence and structure recognized by RIG-I during virus infection, and on assessing the conservation of such properties among RNA virus genera. Defining the characteristics of RIG-I ligands and the diverse effects on the innate and adaptive immune response when multiple PRR pathways interact is essential for informing design of novel therapeutics or adjuvants tailored to specific RNA virus pathogens.",

(1) In resting cells RIG-I is maintained in a resting state in the cytosol characterized by a \u2018closed fist\u2019 conformation with the RD and CARD domains folded over the helicase domain. Interactions with LGP2 may be important for regulating RIG-I. (2) Upon recognition of an RNA ligand containing PAMP motif and exposed 5\u2032ppp RIG-I is ubiquitinated and hydrolyzes ATP to promote a conformational change that holds the ligand PAMP RNA in the RNA binding groove of the RD. (3) Interactions with PACT, ZAPS, TRIM25 and 14-3-3\u03b5 lead to formation of a RIG-I translocase that moves from a soluble compartment in the cell to the mitochondrial associated membranes (MAM) where the complex engages MAVS for downstream signaling. The MAM is a specialized extension of outer mitochondria membrane (Mito) and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) that form a synapse to create an innate immune signaling platform. (4) CARD\u2013CARD interactions between RIG-I and MAVS then initiate activation of the MAVS \u2018signalosome\u2019 which includes TRAF2, 3, and 6, TRADD, TANK, the IRF3 kinases TBK1 and/or IKK\u03b5, and the NF-\u03baB kinase complex. (5) Signaling through these kinases activates IRF3 and NF-\u03baB.
