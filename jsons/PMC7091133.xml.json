The above mentioned indicators meet the clinical diagnostic standards for unexplained pneumonia issued in China (National Health Commission of the People\u2019s Republic of China 2007). But the clinical manifestations in this couple were not exactly the same. On admission, beside fever, the male was predominately manifested by dyspnea and only had mild abnormality in routine urine and stool test results, while the female had obvious gastrointestinal symptoms such as vomiting and diarrhea. These suggest this virus may be present in urine and stools, but we did not run pathogen isolation and detection, and it is only presumption. As for why the male had only abnormality in urine and stools rather than gastrointestinal symptoms, while the female had no abnormality in urine or stools but had gastrointestinal symptoms on the contrary, we have no definite explanation. Before the onset, the couple went to a restaurant one stop away from the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market to eat frozen seafood. Maybe they get sick after being exposed to the same pathogen. The male developed symptoms first and had more severe clinical symptoms, which may be related to his immunity was better than the female. After the first exposure to the virus, patients with better immunity have stronger body reactions.",

Neutrophils and monocytes-macrophages are the major innate immune cells that coordinate innate immunity against viral lung infections. Respiratory viruses can inhibit the innate immune response, and consequently obtain effective opportunities for virus replication and infection. The affected innate immune response also affects subsequent adaptive immune responses; so, viral innate immune evasion often disrupts the complete protective immunity (Kikkert 2020).

On January 5, 2020, the female\u2019 conditions were improved, but the CD3, CD4, and CD8 cells declined further. Perhaps the female patient recalled more immune cells to participate in the antiviral process in her body. Our observations show that the number of CD3, CD4, and CD8 cells cannot predict disease progression. In this study, the male had a more severe decrease in immune cells and more severe conditions than the female. In addition, after comparing our other similar cases, we found that the lower the number of primary immune cells, the more severe the conditions, which is consistent with previous observations (Huang et al.2004).",
