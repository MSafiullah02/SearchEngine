The virus is similar to the SARS coronavirus that spread internationally in 2003, infected more than 8,000 people, and killed almost 800. Infection with COVID-19 has now spread throughout the world, causing widespread social and economic disruption. To control its spread, Chinese officials have imposed extensive travel bans and quarantined large areas. Accelerated development of new vaccines and treatments is already under way. It is too early to know whether any of these efforts will contain the outbreak.",

Of 44,672 laboratory-confirmed patients, almost 5% have had critical illness and almost 50% of critically ill patients have died (3) . The overall case fatality rate (2.3%) has been higher than that seen with seasonal influenza. Most deaths have involved older adults, many of whom have had underlying chronic illnesses. Although there is no known treatment for any coronavirus infection, investigators in China have undertaken several clinical trials. Except for corticosteroids, all of the drugs being tested target coronavirus replication. Unfortunately, very few of these antiviral drugs will be available to people who have been (or will be) infected with COVID-19. Yet, for those who develop severe disease, only one question matters: \"will I live or die?\" This is the question that clinical investigators should address. Could they discover a treatment that might reduce the severity of COVID-19 infection and improve patient survival?",

A supply of a generic statin and a generic angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) was sent to Sierra Leone. Experimental studies had shown that both drugs improved outcomes in experimental acute lung injury/acute respiratory disease syndrome (ARDS) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) . In Sierra Leone, local physicians treated approximately 100 Ebola patients with a combination of the two drugs. They noted \"remarkable improvement\" in survival. Although there was no support for a proper clinical trial, the findings from this unconventional and poorly documented treatment experience were published (10, 11) . During the current Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), expensive vaccines are being used. Investigational monoclonal antibody preparations (12), but not inexpensive generic drug treatments (13), have been tested. There are preliminary signs that the DRC outbreak is coming under control, although the case fatality rate is still 66%.",

The tissue receptor for the virus is ACE2, which is also the receptor for the SARS coronavirus (1) . Several years ago, investigators in the Netherlands and elsewhere showed that ARBs and statins upregulate the activity of ACE2 (14, 15) , and higher levels of ACE2 are associated with a reduced severity of ARDS (16) . Both statins and ARBs target the host response to infection, not the virus (9). They act largely (although not exclusively) on endothelial dysfunction, which is a common feature of many virus infections (17) . Both drugs counter endothelial dysfunction by affecting the ACE2/ angiotensin-(1-7)/Mas and angiopoietin/Tie-2 signaling axes (9) . Combination treatment with these two drugs appears to accelerate a return to homeostasis, allowing patients to recover on their own.",
