The evidence for the presence of an RNA cap comes from immunological detection in Torovirus (family Tobaniviridae) genomic and sg mRNAs (6) and co-migration analysis using low-resolution chromatographic techniques for Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV, family CoV) (7) and Simian Hemorragic fever virus (family Arteriviridae) (8), however there is still no high-resolution structural analysis available for any Nidovirales RNA cap. Other families of the Nidovirales order are assumed to contain a canonical 5\u2032 cap based on the presence of enzymes required in the capping pathway (reviewed in (9)), although direct demonstration of the presence of an RNA cap structure is still missing for many of these viruses.",

Most +RNA viruses supposedly follow this conventional RNA capping pathway in which nascent viral 5\u2032-triphosphate genomic RNA (and sg mRNAs) is processed through three enzymatic reactions to yield an RNA cap whose structure is indistinguishable from that of cellular mRNAs. The capping pathway involves firstly the hydrolysis of the 5\u2032-triphosphate RNA into a 5\u2032-diphosphate by an RNA triphosphatase. A GMP residue (the \u00ab cap \u00bb, originating from GTP) is subsequently covalently transferred to the 5\u2032-diphosphate RNA in the 5\u2032 to 5\u2032 orientation by a guanlylyltransferase (GTase), releasing inorganic pyrophosphate. Both the cap and the first transcribed nucleotide are then methylated at the N7-guanine (mGpppN-RNA, so-called Cap0 structure) and the 2\u2032-oxygen position (mGpppNm-RNA, Cap1 structure) respectively, by one or two S-Adenosyl-Methionine (SAM)-dependent RNA methyltransferases (MTases) (9).",

Until its discovery through elegant yeast-complementation assays (13), all known viral MTases (both N7 and 2\u2032-O) belong to the Rossmann fold (RF) family, one of the five most ubiquitous and ancient super-secondary structures adopted throughout the superfamily of dinucleotide binding enzymes (17,18). Briefly, RF-MTases are characterized predominantly by two structural features; first, a \u03b2\u03b1\u03b2 architecture (formed by a seven-stranded \u03b2-sheet surrounded by 6 \u03b1-helices, with the seventh \u03b2-strand inserted in an anti-parallel orientation between the fifth and sixth strand) and secondly a glycine rich loop (G-x-G-xn-G) which interacts with the SAM cofactor. Viral 2\u2032-O MTases can be further distinguished by the presence of a conserved K-D-K-E catalytic tetrad, and in general have been much better defined than N7-guanine MTases at the structural and functional level (reviewed in (9)). While various crystal structures of viral enzymes involved in N7-guanine methyltransferase activity have been resolved (19\u201323), the identification of a specific signature sequences is far less clear.",

Several previously unidentified MTase signature-sequences have been identified, including the presence of a (presumably) 2\u2032-O-MTase domain in two small-genome arteri-like viruses. Importantly, we also report the discovery of an RF-MTase sequence in the Orf1a of ten members of the Tobaniviridae family, an unusual and previously unseen location for this enzyme. Remarkably, sequence base structure alignments reveal that this enzyme is closely related to the canonical eukaryotic RF-N7-guanine MTase, suggesting it performs the currently missing N7-guanine RNA cap methylation for this family. If this is the case, this would represent the first RF-N7-guanine MTase identified for the Nidovirales order.

From this alignment, we first determined that the majority of viruses within the Nidovirales order code for at least one RF-MTase protein, identified through the presence of the G-x-G-xn-G element of the SAM binding motif. These RF-MTase domains were additionally found to contain the canonical K-D-K E catalytic tetrad of 2\u2032-O-MTases (Figure 1, green and Table 1). Conversely, this MTase was confirmed to be absent in members of the Arteriviridae family, including EAV, PRRSV and LDV.

Similar to the CoV 2\u2032-O-MTase encoded on nsp16, all the identified RF- MTases, including the small-genome, arteri-like Nidoviruses, are located in a conserved genomic position at the 3\u2032-end of Orf1b.",

This has been most studied for the CoV family, where the N7-guanine MTase is fused to an N-terminal ExoN domain encoded on nsp14. It has been previously reported that the N7-guanine MTase domain is not uniformly present in nsp14-containing nidoviruses (24). Likewise, we could only identify NRF-N7-guanine MTase signature sequences (which line the SAM binding site of the nsp14 SARS MTase structure, PDB ID: 5C8U) for the CoVs and most mesoniviruses. In contrast, we were unable to detect any nsp14-like NRF-MTase for the majority of the other families within the Nidovirales order, including Arteriviridae, Medionivirdae, Roniviridae, Euroniviridae, Abyssoviridae, Mononiviridae and Tobaniviridae. Two notable exceptions are apparent. First, we were able to detect a nsp14-like NRF-MTase at the expected genomic Orf1b position in Fathead Minnow nidovirus 1 of the Tobaniviridae family. The conserved NRF folding, combined with the absence of the K-D-K-E catalytic tetrad of 2\u2032-O MTases leads us to hypothesize that, like in CoVs, this enzyme is responsible for N7-guanine methylation of the RNA cap structure. Secondly, unique members of Abyssoviridae and Mononiviridae also possess an MTase signature-sequence at the C-terminus of their nsp14-like gene (i.e. fused to the ExoN domain). Curiously though, this MTase is readily detectable using HH-Pred as a RF-MTase, distinguishing it from the known Nidovirus NRF-N-7-guanine MTase. The identified nsp14-like MTase also lacks the characteristic K-D-K-E catalytic tetrad of the RF-2\u2032-O MTases. We therefore cannot confirm the precise role of this identified MTase. We therefore deduce that the nidovirus enzyme responsible for N7-guanine methylation does not appear to be located in a conserved genomic location, nor contains a conserved structural architecture. The majority of viruses in the CoV and Mesoniviridae families appear to utilise a nidoviruses specific, NRF-MTase located directly downstream of the ExoN domain, as described for SARS-CoV. For other families, the enzyme responsible for N7-guanine methylation of the RNA-cap remains to be defined.",

However, there is no obvious signature sequence to indicate bi-functionality, and furthermore no evidence to suggest that the activity for those virus families would deviate from the 2\u2032-O methylation specificity shown for the same domain of large-genome nidoviruses (36,37).

In order to expand our search criteria and establish potential activity of identified MTase domains in the Nidovirales order, we first attempted to discern a specific N7-guanine MTase signature sequence which could be used to aid in defining this family of enzymes. A wealth of structural and mechanistic data has been acquired from N7-guanine MTases from the microsporidian parasite Encephalitozoon cuniculi (Ecm1, PDB ID: 1Z3C) (38) and the D1:D12 heterodimer of the dsDNA Poxvirus (PDB ID: 4CKB) (37). Regarding RNA viruses, there are only three crystal structures of RF-MTases known to methylate N7-guanine caps. They are the rotavirus VP4 (PDB ID: 1KQR) the reovirus Lambda2 (PDB ID: 1EJ6) of the dsRNA Reoviridae family (21,22), and the West Nile Virus NS5 of the +RNA Flavivirus family (PDB ID: 2OYO) which performs bi-functional N7-guanine and 2\u2032-O-MTase activities (39). Combining this data with structural information from the human RNA N7-guanine methyltransferase (PDB ID: 3BGV), we were unable to define specific N7-guanine MTase sequence motifs (Supplementary Figure S1), suggesting that structural conservation has likely prevailed over sequence conservation. We therefore narrowed the structural comparison to include only Encephalitozoon cuniculi, poxvirus and the human RNA N7-guanine Mtases. This allowed detection of five conserved amino acid motifs K/G/D/HY/E/Y (Supplementary Figure S2), spatially coherent in the structure to fulfil the binding and catalytic reaction.",

RNA virus cap-MTases perform two types of reactions: the methylation of the N7-guanine of the RNA cap, and the methylation of the adenosine 2\u2032-O ribose of the first transcribed nucleotide (9). Most of these viral MTases, with SARS-CoV nsp14 as a notable exception, belong to the RF family of enzymes (reviewed in (9)). The RF is an evolutionary ancient fold, which has been widely evolved to perform a variety of chemical reactions. Its structural plasticity is well illustrated by the Blue tongue virus VP4 MTase (family Reoviridae) which incorporates an entire functional domain within two additional secondary structure elements, in addition to the flavivirus NS5 MTase, which is able to perform both N7-guanine and 2\u2032-O ribose methylation with the same \u223c33 kDa domain fused to the N-terminus of the viral RdRp (23,39).",

Furthermore, the pathway and target molecule for N7-guanine methylation appears to be somewhat variable. For example in some families of viruses this reaction can be performed on a GTP molecule which is then used to cap the RNA (40). This is the case with the alphavirus nsp1 enzyme, whose structure is currently unknown. On the other hand, several crystal structures of viral enzymes involved in N7-guanine methylation of RNA caps have been reported, such as that of flaviviruses (NS5, (23,39)), rotaviruses and reoviruses (VP4 and lambda2, respectively (21,22)), and coronaviruses (nsp14, (19,20)). As stated above, the majority of these N7-MTases also adopt a RF (with the exception of SARS nsp14).

The large-scale distribution of this domain, including in two small-genome arteri-like viruses (HHPA and NGSA) is somewhat surprising and may have a significant impact on our understanding of genome size evolution in Nidovirales.

The presence of an MTase in Orf1a is unexpected, and has not been reported before, although signature sequences of an uncharacterized MTase had been detected in Ball Python nidovirus, Sectovirus 1 and Infratovirus 1 (25). Protein and enzyme functions in Nidovirales have been classified into a functional triangle (24), with each side of the triangle representing a carrier of the following roles: Orf1a- host defense; Orf1b\u2014genome replication and maintenance; 3\u2032 nested Orfs\u2014structural and accessory proteins. In this triangle, the MTase activity involved in genome maintenance would usually map to Orf1b (24). The location in Orf1a may therefore suggest additional or auxiliary roles in tasks other than RNA capping, however this remains to be determined. Accordingly, it was recently reported that viral or cellular MTases can be recruited by viruses in order to induce internal methylation of their genome (41) and escape to the antiviral response mediated by MDA5 (42). Furthermore, \u22121 ribosomal frameshifting being a mechanism commonly used in viral and cellular proteins to regulate ratios and copy numbers of specific genes, it would suggest that the levels of Orf1a products is higher than those of Orf1b, raising the question as to why only Tobaniviridae members would need this additional MTase in higher quantities.",
