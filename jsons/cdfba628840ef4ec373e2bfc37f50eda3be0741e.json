Approximately 60%-80% of HCV infections progress into chronic diseases, including steatosis, cirrhosis, and liver cancer. 1 The standard of care for the treatment for HCV infection include pegylated interferon-a (IFN-a), ribavirin, and IFN-free direct-acting antiviral (DAA) agents. The recent use of DAA, including protease inhibitors and polymerase inhibitors, have advanced the efficacy of anti-HCV agents to almost cure for most HCV genotypes. 2 However, DAA treatment is not suitable for patients with advanced infection that are with a high risk of liver failure, development of hepatocellular carcinoma, or death. 2 In addition, patients with a prior history of hepatocellular carcinoma and who have been treated with DAA for HCV infection have an unexpected high recurrence rate of liver cancer than previously predicted, with the recurrence rate of >40% in some subgroups. 3 In addition, the emerging resistance and high cost of DAA treatment is still a high barrier that hinders broad access to patients. 4 In addition to the HCV genome-encoded nonstructural (NS) proteins, host factors play essential functions in every step of the HCV life cycle. Drugs targeted at host factors, cellular components, or functions involved in viral life cycle are emerging as new therapeutic options for the management of HCV infection, especially potential agents to be used in combination with DAA. 5 For example, small molecule inhibitors that inhibit the peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerase activity of cyclophilins can suppress replication of HCV, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and coronaviruses. 5 Our previous study suggested that heat shock cognate protein 70 (Hsc70) binds to the 3 0 untranslated region (NTR) and is involved actively in HCV replication. 6 Allosteric regulation of the ATPase activity of Hsc70 by tylophorine analogs DCB-3503 and rac-cryptopleurine perturbed translation of HCV RNA, which lead to inhibition of HCV replication. 6 rac-Cryptopleurine analogs exhibited inhibitory activities against several diseases, including cancer, 7, 8 arthritis, 9 inflammation, 10 and dysentery. 11 We designed and synthesized a series of E-ring modified rac-cryptopleurine analogs, 7,10 which showed improved anti-cancer activity than the parent compounds. 7, 10 We recently reported that tylophorine analog DCB-3503 perturbed translation of HCV RNA via disruption of the replication complex, especially the binding between NS5A, NS5B, HCV RNA, and heat shock cognate protein 70 (Hsc70). 6 Despite the potency rac-cryptopleurine exhibited, the selection index of this compound to HCV replication and cytotoxicity is low (IC 50 / EC 50 is only <4 fold, Table 1 ). Modification of the E-ring of rac-cryptopleurine also changed the potency and inhibitory effect on NF-jB, AP-1, and CRE signaling pathways. 12 Therefore, modification on the E-ring has the potential to yield compounds with improved pharmacological profiles than rac-cryptopleurine. In this study, we determined the structural-activity relationship (SAR) correlations of E-ring modified rac-cryptopleurine analogs on anti-HCV activity and modulation of chaperone activity of Hsc70, aiming to provide insight into the structures that we could further modify to design new compound(s) having anti HCV activity with decreasing cytotoxicity.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 185, "end": 186, "text": "1", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 511, "end": 512, "text": "2", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 684, "end": 685, "text": "2", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 945, "end": 946, "text": "3", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1078, "end": 1079, "text": "4", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1458, "end": 1459, "text": "5", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1665, "end": 1666, "text": "5", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1827, "end": 1828, "text": "6", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 2122, "end": 2124, "text": "7,", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 2125, "end": 2126, "text": "8", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 2138, "end": 2139, "text": "9", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 2172, "end": 2174, "text": "11", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 2337, "end": 2339, "text": "10", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 2565, "end": 2566, "text": "6", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 2880, "end": 2882, "text": "12", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 2729, "end": 2736, "text": "Table 1", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Previously, we established relationships between the anti-cancer activity and protein synthesis inhibitory effect of tylophorine and rac-cryptopleurine analogs with variously substituted and sized E-rings. 12, 13 In this study, we focused on the effect of how E-ring modifications affect the anti-HCV activity.

Cyclophilin A (CypA) directly regulated HIV infectivity by interacting with the N-terminal domain of HIV-1 capsid protein. 21 CypA also mediated HCV RNA binding to HCV NS5A andstimulated replication of HCV RNA. 22 Hsc70 co-localized with HCV particles in lipid droplet in the infected cells. 14 Hsc70 is also a major chaperone protein participating in the assembly of several subcellular complexes, for example HCV replication complex 6 and RNA-induced silencing complex. 23 The chaperone function of Hsc70 is governed by the N-terminal nucleotide binding domain (NBD) with ATPase activity. 24 Mutation of the ATPase pocket abolished the chaperone activity of Hsc70 and its binding to RNA. 25, 26 By promoting the ATPase activity of Hsc70, rac-cryptopleurine and DCB-3503 inhibited HCV. 6, 26 Thus, we next determined the impact of cryptopleurine analogs on the ATP/ADP turnover of Hsc70. Addition of rac-cryptopleurine enhanced ADP production by promoting the ATPase activity of Hsc70 at 10 mM (Fig. 2B ). The effect on Hsc70 ATPase activity of all cryptopleurine analogs were examined at 10 mM in the same fashion as rac-cryptopleurine; only YXM-110 exhibited similar allosteric regulation of Hsc70 (Fig. 2) . We previously that rac-cryptopleurine bound physically but non-covalently to the NBD of Hsc70 6,26 ; therefore, functional analog(s) could interfere with the binding between rac-cryptopleurine and Hsc70. We next performed an affinity binding assay using biotinylated-rac-cryptopleurine, 6, 26 and eluted Hsc70 bound to the affinity resin with rac-cryptopleurine or its analogs. YXM-110, but not YXM-109, YXM-139, nor YXM-140, eluted Hsc70 bound to the affinity resin in the similar fashion as that of rac-cryptopleurine (Fig. 3) . This result together with the result in the ATP/ ADP turnover assay suggested that YXM-110, but not other cryptopleurine derivatives, is a functional analog of rac-cryptopleurine with similar mechanism(s) of action. YXM-109 and YXM-140 may exhibited anti-HCV activity through other mechanism(s) rather than modulating ATPase activity of Hsc70. Analogs such as YXM-66, YXM-82, YXM-101, YXM-83, YXM-142, and YXM-93 lost the ability to modulate ATPase activity of Hsc70 (Fig. 3) . The turnover of ATP/ADP of Hsc70 is primarily governed by its chaperone activity. 27 Co-chaperone protein nucleotide exchange factor c-terminal of Bag1 (cBag, or Bag-1 M) increased the ATPase activity of Hsc70 in combination with rac-cryptopleurine or DCB-3503. 26 We then determined whether rac-cryptopleurine and YXM-110 affected luciferase refolding activity of Hsc70. Purified native luciferase was first denatured with 6 M guanidine-HCl and incubated with Hsc70 in the presence or absence of rac-cryptopleurine or YXM-110. Luciferase activity was determined using 2 ml aliquot of the reaction mixture at specific time point (Fig. 4) .
