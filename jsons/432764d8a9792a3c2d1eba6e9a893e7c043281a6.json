This highlights a consequential gap in our collective medical knowledge with the potential to change patient outcomes. Purpose of Review To briefly review epidemiology and pathophysiology of SICM and provide a more extensive review of the data on diagnostic and management strategies. Recent Findings SICM is likely underdiagnosed and that has mortality implications. Current evidence supports speckle tracking echocardiography to identify decreased contractility irrespective of left ventricular ejection fraction for the diagnosis of SICM. There continues to be a dearth of large clinical trials evaluating the treatment of SICM and current consensus focuses on supportive measures such as vasopressors and inotropes. Summary Sepsis is a significant cause of mortality, and sepsis-induced cardiomyopathy has both prognostic and management implications for these patients. Individualized work-up and management of these patients is crucial to improving outcomes.",

Sepsis-induced cardiomyopathy (SICM), or sepsis-induced myocardial dysfunction (SIMD), is an increasingly recognized form of transient cardiac dysfunction in the septic patients. Despite implications for patient outcomes, the critical care community has not given significant emphasis on this syndrome and prominent critical care textbooks [4, 5] do not have dedicated sections on SICM.",

Increasing age, diabetes mellitus, pre-existing heart failure, and elevated proBNP were all associated with increased odds ratio for septic cardiomyopathy [8] . Again, there is some discrepancy between these studies that may be based on patient population (Japanese vs Korean, respectively), but both cite preexisting heart failure as a risk factor. It should also be noted that in both studies, SICM was defined as an \"EF [ejection fraction] < 50% and a \u2265 10% decrease in the patient's baseline LVEF\" [8] .

While recent echocardiographic outcome prediction studies support these findings of LVEF [10, 11\u2022, 12] , the strain of the myocardium (measured by echocardiographic speckle) was found to be a significant predictor of higher mortality in SICM [12\u2022] . Additionally, isolated RV dysfunction in sepsis was associated with worse 1-year survival [13] . A recent database study suggested that among patients with sepsis, echocardiographic assessment of the myocardium influenced hemodynamic management liberated patients from vasopressors earlier and decreased 28-day mortality [14\u2022 ]. In summary, LVEF is a poor diagnostic tool, and better measures, such as strain, do suggest that SICM portends a poorer prognosis and proper diagnosis will effect management to improve mortality.",

While it was initially thought that SICM was pathologically akin to coronary artery disease, a landmark study showed that the gross coronary perfusion is actually increased in patients with established septic shock [16] . Since these trials, many myocardial depressant factors have been identified including cytokines, components of the complement cascade, pathogen-associated molecular patterns, endogenous damage-associated molecular patterns, oxidative stress, altered nitric oxide metabolism, mitochondrial dysfunction, abnormal calcium movement within cells, myocyte apoptosis, and autonomic dysregulation [17, 18\u2022] . Furthermore, the endothelial glycocalyx [19] is shed in sepsis causing vascular leak, coagulation, and inflammation and is associated with adverse outcomes [20] . Once disrupted, the endothelium can cause heterogeneous microvascular flow and myocardial edema [21] which is an underexplored mechanism of SICM. A very recent study [21] used cardiac magnetic resonance imaging and histology to show that myocardial edema may in part explain the rise of cardiac troponin seen in SICM. ",

This likely leads to underdiagnosis of SICM when LVEF is used alone. We think that this explains the \"paradox\" of improved survival identified by Parker et al. [9] as a patient with profound shock (vasodilation) with a \"normal EF\" may do worse than one with less shock and a \"low EF\" [36, 37] .

Normal values are \u2212 17 to \u2212 23% (more negative is better). In patients with septic shock, GLS proved to be the most sensitive measurement of SICM with an average \u2212 14% among patients with septic shock [43] . Interestingly the LVEF of those patients was normal [43] . A key benefit of the speckle tracking is that it is not as susceptible to afterload reduction pseudo-normalization that plagues the LVEF.

In addition, a \"normal\" CO does not rule out SICM since a low SVR may falsely elevate the measured CO, and CO does not necessarily reflect intrinsic cardiomyocyte function/contractility. To overcome the former barrier, Werdan et al. developed an \"afterload-related cardiac performance\" (ACP) calculation to integrate information from both SVR and CO [51] . The derived calculation is ACP (%) = CO measured /CO predicted \u00d7 100% with > 80% considered normal. CO predicted was derived for this calculation with a nonlinear regression model obtained from a cohort of 524 patients. They reported that this measure has both diagnostic and prognostic utility in their small, single-center study [51] . In 2013, they expanded upon these findings with a larger study; however, all data was collected at the same center, and further studies are needed before many clinicians would consider resurrecting the routine use of PA catheters for this purpose [52] .",

While this is essential for the treatment of distributive shock, increasing afterload will drop cardiac output and could result in the \"unmasking\" of cardiac dysfunction.

In the case of dopamine, risk of arrhythmias and potential increased mortality has led to the recommendation against its use for septic shock.

It is necessary to be judicious with fluid management after the initial resuscitation phase by using dynamic measures of fluid responsiveness such as pulse pressure variation, inferior vena cava collapse, passive straight leg raise, and end-expiratory occlusion. While each of these measures has strengths and weakness, the overarching goal of these measures is to account for differences in cardiac function as it relates to fluid responsiveness in a dynamic manner rather than traditional static measures (i.e., CVP, PCWP). Currently the PETAL Network is recruiting for the Crystalloid Liberal or Vasopressors Early Resuscitation in Sepsis (CLOVERS) to further evaluate this topic.

Hernandez and colleagues, however, performed a randomized controlled trial on the microcirculatory perfusion in patients with septic shock with low cardiac output, and despite an increase in CI, those parameters did not improve with dobutamine [61] . This suggests that although CO improves with dobutamine, it may not overcome the end-organ damage intrinsic in septic states. It seems intuitive that cardiac output needs to be supraphysiologic in the septic state, but Gattinoni et al. found that targeting supranormal values of cardiac index did not improve morbidity or mortality [62, 63] . Given the potential pitfalls of inotropic therapy, there are some studies to corroborate the downsides. Hayes et al. found that using dobutamine to augment cardiac index and systemic oxygen delivery worsened in-hospital mortality. In this study, though, all patients were treated with dopamine, and we can surmise from the dopamine data that the combination of dopamine and dobutamine is high risk for arrhythmias [64] . Further, a retrospective study by Wilkman et al. showed an increased 90-day mortality in patients with septic shock treated with inotropes [65] . Only a correlation, however, can be surmised from that study which may be representative of worse prognosis with septic cardiomyopathy. This seems to be supported by trials by Rhodes and Kumar in which they showed failure of cardiac output to increase with dobutamine portends a poorer prognosis [66, 67] . Two other interesting studies on potential pitfalls of dobutamine are done by Lyte suggesting that dobutamine facilitates biofilm formation on indwelling catheters in vitro and one by Hartemink in which dobutamine is associated with increased circulating TNFalpha levels [68, 69] .",

Moreover, it acts in a catecholamine-independent manner to minimize effects on oxygen demand, arrhythmias, and catecholamine resistance from sepsis. Morelli et al. performed a randomized, prospective trial published in 2005 which showed levosimendan improved hemodynamics (LVEF + CI) in patients not responsive to dobutamine at 5 microg/kg/min because of adrenergic hyporesponsiveness. They also showed that levosimendan increased gastric mucosal flow, creatinine clearance, urine output, and lactate clearance compared with dobutamine [72] . A meta-analysis (of 7 trials) by Zangrillo published in 2015 showed that levosimendan had a mortality benefit when compared to dobutamine [73] . The next major trial to come out was the LeoPARDS trial in 2016. This double-blind RCT compared levosimendan to placebo plus standard of care for sepsis and found no difference in SOFA scores or mortality but a trend toward worse mortality with levosimendan. In addition, the levosimendan group was more likely to have SVT, required higher vasopressor doses, and was less likely to be weaned from ventilator. Of note, in the placebo arm, less than 10% of patients received inotropic support, which does bring into question the prevalence of SICM in the study population [74\u2022] . Overall, the data for levosimendan is mixed, and the LeoPARDS trial should give practitioners pause before adopting its use broadly.",

It would seem that any negative inotropic effects would be detrimental to a patient who is relying on a hyperdynamic state, but this increased adrenergic state seems to play a role in the pathogenesis of septic cardiomyopathy. For this reason, the use of selective beta-blockers may help to decrease myocardial oxygen demand, increase diastolic filling, and ultimately improve septic cardiomyopathy. Early studies showed that esmolol did not change lactate and reduced TNF-alpha levels, and that beta-1 selective agents may have anti-inflammatory effects [75, 76] . An observational study of 9465 cases of sepsis found that patients prescribed with beta-blockers prior to admission had a significantly lower mortality (17.7% vs 22.1%) [77] . This sparked interest in prospective studies, the largest of which was performed by Morelli; they performed a non-blinded RCT which showed that the use of esmolol targeting a heart rate of 80-94 increased stroke volume and reduced vasopressor requirement. They also found an improved 28-day survival, but they were not powered for this outcome, and mortality in the placebo group was 80% which is much higher than expected [78\u2022] .

An observational study of 3 patients found that its use improved heart rate, stroke volume index, end-diastolic volume index, and SvO2 while decreasing lactate and norepinephrine dose [79] . This should be taken with a grain of salt as a larger trial demonstrated a trend toward worsened mortality in ivabradine group, but this did not reach statistical significance [80\u2022] . This larger trial, however, is difficult to interpret in relation to SICM as patients with both cardiac and septic shock were included, and the subgroups were not analyzed separately.",

This has a vasodilatory effect as well as impairing the cardiovascular systems response to catecholamines. Methylene blue has routinely been used to treat vasoplegia after cardiovascular surgery because it acts by inhibiting guanylate cyclase and NOS to counteract this mechanism. A 2014 review by Lo et al. found 16 articles on the topic of MB for the treatment of septic shock including two randomized controlled studies. These studies showed a significant improvement in blood pressure and decreased requirement for vasopressors but no difference in other outcomes [81] [82] [83] . There is only one case report [84] . Like all therapies, MB is not without risks; it can contribute to serotonin syndrome, worsening arterial oxygenation (through pulmonary vasoconstriction), infiltration injury, and impaired mesenteric blood flow. Overall, MB is a potential treatment for septic shock, and more evidence is necessary before it can be adopted broadly for the treatment of septic cardiomyopathy.",

There are no randomized controlled trials for intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP), percutaneous ventricular assist devices, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). There are multiple case reports providing examples of both successful and unsuccessful use of these devices in patients with septic cardiomyopathy. One consideration before deciding on the appropriate support device is the patient-specific hemodynamics such as LV, RV, or Bi-V failure and systolic vs diastolic dysfunction. In their 2015 review, Sato and Nasu provide a summary of the ECMO case reports in which 18/23 patients survived [30] .

A summary of the basic pathophysiology, work-up, and management of SICM is provided in Fig. 2 . Clinicals should consider the diagnosis in patients with sepsis-associated organ dysfunction and particularly septic shock requiring vasopressor therapy. Biomarkers can provide prognostic information and put SICM on the clinician's radar, but their diagnostic utility is limited. Echocardiography is currently the gold standard of diagnosis, and evaluation of global longitudinal strain is more sensitive and specific for SICM than LVEF or other common findings alone. Standard management includes the use of vasopressors, inotropes, and judicious fluid resuscitation, but large studies validating these measures are lacking. Additionally, while there is growing evidence for other therapies for SICM, more data is needed to make any definitive recommendations about adopting them to everyday practice. Finally, a consensus statement on diagnostic criteria is currently lacking and is essential in future studies evaluating treatment.",

Biomarkers while sensitive, are not specific, but do portent a poorer prognosis. Echocardiography should include global longitudinal strain which is the most sensitive and specific (although there are no agreed upon cutoff values). Judicious fluids should include dynamic measures (such as pulse pressure variation) to judge fluid responsiveness. Norepinephrine is considered the standard vasopressor and dobutamine is considered the standard inotrope. There is limited evidence for other vasopressors or inotropes. Adjuncts can include mechanical support (i.e. ECMO). PAMPs, pathogen-associated molecular patterns; DAMPs, damage-associated molecular patterns; NO, nitric oxide; TTE, transthoracic echocardiogram; ECMO, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation describing the successful use of MB specifically for septic cardiomyopathy in a burn patient by Schlesinger in 2016",
