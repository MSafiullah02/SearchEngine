The high positivity rate in our community patients is likely a result of a very targeted local COVID-19 testing program led by the NHS 111 and East Midlands PHE teams, where the COVID-19 case definition became relatively more sensitive and specific outside of our normal seasonal influenza period. The latter had ended earlier than usual this year in Leicester (effectively by the end of February 2020), making it more likely that any acute febrile influenza-like illness was due to COVID-19.",
