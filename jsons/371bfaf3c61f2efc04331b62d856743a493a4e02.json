While most cases being admitted to the operating room today fall under the auspices of life-threatening or limb threatening operations, cancer surgery is arguably lifethreatening if not conducted within a \"reasonable\" time-frame. In addition, prioritization of resources away from cancer patients, who themselves are immunocompromised and debilitated, continues to raise major ethical dilemmas that continue to evolve. Finally, for these same reasons, questions arise as to the COVID-19 risk to cancer patients undergoing surgical procedures.",

This strategy increase objectivity, transparency, and consistency across all cases presented. In addition, the approach to cases is current, reflects resources at the hospital during that period of time, and may change on a week-to-week basis (e.g. fluctuations in bed capacity and blood product availability).
