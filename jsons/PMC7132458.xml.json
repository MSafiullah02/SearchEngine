            "text": "Ethanol is widely used in hand rubs, gels, and foams for hand hygiene in healthcare settings [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7]. The World Health Organization has even listed ethanol at 80% (v/v) as an essential medicine in the category \u2018alcohol-based hand rub\u2019 [8]. Since 1994 the US Food and Drug Administration considers ethanol between 60% and 95% as generally safe and effective for hand rubbing, although the safety aspect has been under review again since 2015 [9]. Recent studies indicated that there may be a risk from systemic absorption and long-term exposure. The aim of the new proposed rule is to demonstrate systemic safety under daily and long-term use [10]. The spectrum of antimicrobial activity of a hand rub used in healthcare must include bacteria and yeasts according to EN 14885; virucidal activity, however, is not mandatory [11]. However, \u223c5% of all healthcare-associated infections are caused by viruses, so virucidal activity of hand rubs has relevance in some units with a high prevalence of viral disease and during viral outbreaks [12]. The European terminology allows three different claims on virucidal activity: \u2018active against enveloped viruses\u2019; \u2018limited spectrum virucidal activity\u2019 which includes enveloped viruses, adenoviruses, noroviruses and rotaviruses; and \u2018virucidal activity\u2019 which includes all viruses relevant in human medicine [13]. Numerous studies have been published on the virucidal activity of ethanol solutions and products but the spectrum of virucidal activity of ethanol has so far not been described in detail. The aim of this review is therefore to describe the spectrum of virucidal activity of ethanol in vitro and in vivo. In addition, the European claims are evaluated regarding specific viruses that may not be covered by the test viruses selected for a specific claim.",

In addition, studies deemed suitable for this review were also included. Data were extracted from the publications and were selected when they provided original data on reduction of viral infectivity in suspension tests (49 studies) and on contaminated hands (17 studies). A solution or product was considered sufficiently effective against a virus in a suspension test when it achieved \u22654 log10 reduction or the limit of detection was reached. There was no minimum criterion for the limit of detection so that solutions or products could have passed in an assay, although the initial viral titre may have been low or the cytotoxicity of the product may have been high, resulting in an overall low log10 reduction of viral infectivity. Studies were not included when they provided data on the reduction of viral infectivity on inanimate surfaces or used other methods to determine efficacy (e.g. reduction of viral RNA).",

Other viruses are only sufficiently inactivated by ethanol at 95% such as poliovirus, echovirus 11, human enterovirus, and coxsackievirus B3 (\u226585% ethanol). The majority of ethanol-based hand rubs with concentrations up to 90% are therefore likely to yield <4 log10 reduction against these viruses, suggesting insufficient efficacy. The addition of acids to the formulation such as phosphoric acid, citric acid, or peracetic acid can substantially improve the virucidal efficacy of ethanol, as shown with adenovirus type 2, poliovirus type 1, polyomavirus, HAV, FMDV, and FCV. Although the efficacy is better, the dermal tolerance is likely to be worse. Post-marketing surveillance of an ethanol-based hand rub with phosphoric acid revealed frequent and significant skin lesions among the users [74]. Improved formulations, however, may have better user acceptability [75], [76]. It would be beneficial in any case to look at the user acceptability of a virucidal hand rub locally before healthcare workers are asked to use it [77].",

Ethanol, probably at 70%, has been selected as the reference alcohol. Ethanol as an alcohol has a superior efficacy against non-enveloped viruses compared with the propanols. Against MNV, for example, most studies indicate that iso-propanol is considerably less effective compared with ethanol [43], [44], [46]. Against FCV iso-propanol has overall only poor virucidal activity [44], [47]. And enteroviruses have been reported to be more or less resistant to iso-propanol at various concentrations within 10 min [14], [51], [54], [55], [78].",

A non-virucidal reference alcohol may therefore be found in the future as a positive control for the phase 2, step 2 test for virucidal efficacy on hands, which may reduce the credibility and acceptance of the upcoming standard.
