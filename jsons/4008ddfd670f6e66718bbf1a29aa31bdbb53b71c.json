In this study, we characterized the interaction between erythrocytes and unrelated Ad serotypes, human 5 (HAd5) and 37 (HAd37), and canine 2 (CAV-2). While these serotypes agglutinate human erythrocytes, they use different receptors, have different tropisms and/or infect different species. Using molecular, biochemical, structural and transgenic animal-based analyses, we found that the primary erythrocyte interaction domain for HAd37 is its sialic acid binding site, while CAV-2 binding depends on at least three factors: electrostatic interactions, sialic acid binding and, unexpectedly, binding to the coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor (CAR) on human erythrocytes. We show that the presence of CAR on erythrocytes leads to prolonged in vivo blood half-life and significantly reduced liver infection when a CAR-tropic Ad is injected intravenously. This study provides i) a molecular and structural rationale for Ad-erythrocyte interactions, ii) a basis to improve vector-mediated gene transfer and iii) a mechanism that may explain the biodistribution and pathogenic inconsistencies found between human and animal models.",

To date, all Ads display a characteristic, icosahedral symmetry in which 240 subunits of the trimeric hexon protein form the facets and 12 copies of the penton, comprising the pentameric penton base protein and the externally projecting trimeric fiber, form the vertices [1] . While the stoichiometry of the penton base and hexon is apparently conserved, the fiber can exist as a single or double copy at each vertex [2] . At least in vitro and for most cell types, the fiber mediates the initial attachment to primary receptors, such as the D1 domain of the coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor (CAR), sialic acids, CD46, and others (for review see Zhang & Bergelson [3] ). Interaction with auxiliary receptor(s), in particular some of the dimeric integrins via the Arg-Gly-Asp sequence (an integrininteracting motif) on the penton base, may induce internalization of some serotypes. However, other auxiliary receptors or mechanism of internalization may exist for human serotypes 40 and 41 (HAd40/41), and canine serotype 2 (CAV-2), which have no identifiable integrin-interacting motif in the penton base [4, 5] .",

Approximately 50 of these are currently classed as human pathogens that, in most cases, generate subclinical ocular, respiratory and gastrointestinal tract infections. In the immunocompromised host however, lethal HAd infections can spread, via unknown mechanisms, to the kidney, liver and brain [6, 7] . The human Ads (HAds) are divided into subgroups (or species or subgenera) A -F. The triage of the human serotypes into subgroups is based in part on serotype-specific ex vivo erythrocyte cross-linking (or hemagglutination) [8] . The clinical hemagglutination assays use lysates from virus-infected cells to crosslink erythrocytes from a handful of species. This highly heterogeneous lysate contains whole virus particles, empty capsids, penton monomers, penton dodecahedrons, fiber monomers, hexon etc. By using fractionated infected cell lysate, a handful of laboratories found that the multivalent complexes containing fiber were responsible for hemagglutination [9] [10] [11] [12] .",

With its high sialic acid content, glycophorin A is the main contributor to the net negative cell-surface charge and is critical for minimizing cellcell interactions and preventing erythrocyte aggregation [13] . Sialic acid is a collective term for a family of 9-carbon monosaccharides, which are often found as terminal sugar residues on glycans of glycoproteins and glycolipids (usually a2-3, -6 or -8 linked). In addition to some HAds, a number of viruses, including orthomyxoviruses, paramyxoviruses, picornaviruses, papovaviruses, coronaviruses, reoviruses and parvoviruses bind to sialic acids [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] . Possibly because erythrocytes from different species vary in their sialic acid content, the hemagglutination properties of sialic acid-binding viruses may also diverge [19] .",

Among the HAds, serotype 37 is unusual: its fiber head can bind CAR, CD46 and sialic acid, but the virus appears to use only the latter two as functional receptors [24] [25] [26] . Burmeister et al. found that the sialic acid moiety bound to a basic patch close to the center of the trimeric fiber heads of HAd37 and HAd19p [27] . Interestingly, the putative hemagglutination domain in subgroup D heads partially aligns with the sialyl-lactose binding site, which on the basis of sequence alignments is likely to be conserved in other members of this subgroup.

Although both HAd37 and CAV-2 agglutinate human erythrocytes at low particle-to-cell ratios, they use different receptors (sialic acid and CD46 vs. CAR) [5, 25, 26] , have different clinical tropisms (ocular vs. respiratory tract) and infect different species. We found that HAd37-erythrocyte interaction is primarily due to sialic acid binding. We show by structural analysis that the CAV-2 fiber head also contains a sialic acid binding site, but in contrast to HAd37 this site is modestly involved in hemagglutination. Unexpectedly, our biochemical and competition analyses suggested that CAV-2erythrocyte interactions also depend on binding to CAR on human and rat erythrocytes. Using a transgenic mouse that expresses CAR on erythrocytes [28] we demonstrate that CAR-binding Ads can be sequestered by CAR-expressing erythrocytes, and prevent liver infection. Our study provides a molecular and structural rationale for the 50-year-old enigma of ex vivo Aderythrocyte interactions. In addition to the relevance for Ad pathogenesis and vector biology, the expression of CAR by human erythrocytes may shed light on the role of cell adhesion molecules during erythropoiesis.",

When compared to HAd37, CAV-2 hemagglutinates at ,20-fold lower ratio (i.e. more efficiently, Figure 1B ). In our hands, and consistent with others [29] , HAd5 also agglutinated human erythrocytes, but at a higher ratio (.800 pp/erythrocyte) ( Figure 1C ). To assay the roles of HAd37 and CAV-2 capsid proteins, we incubated erythrocytes with chimeric HAd5 vectors harboring the fiber from HAd37 [30] or the fiber head from CAV-2 [31] . We found that the HAd5-HAd37F and HAd5-CAV-2H hybrid capsids induced agglutination at lower ratios than HAd5 but not quite to those of HAd37 and CAV-2 ( Figure 1D and E). Pre-incubating erythrocytes with neuraminidase, which removes sialic acid from their membranes, eliminated agglutination by HAd37 and a HAd5-HAd37F hybrid capsid ( Figure 1 , right hand column). In contrast, removing sialic acid from erythrocyte membranes only modestly reduced CAV-2 and the hybrid HAd5-CAV-2H agglutination (data summarized in Table 1 ).",

To assess, predict and understand adenovirus biology and vectorology, many in vivo studies use mice and monkeys. These animal models have been considered reliable models in the realm of viral pathogenesis and gene transfer. One of the implications of our study suggests that the rat may be a more appropriate model during intravenous adenovirus delivery because like humans, and unlike mice and monkeys, they also express CAR on their erythrocytes. The identification of CAR on human erythrocytes explains a 50-year-old enigma of adenovirus hemagglutination, helps us better understand adenovirus in vivo biology and may open new avenues to understand the role of cell adhesion molecules during erythropoiesis.",

The electron density maps showed clear density for six N-acetyl neuraminic acid (Neu5AC) moieties in the asymmetric unit, three per fiber head trimer. Sialyl-lactose is composed of three sugar rings, the sialic acid moiety being linked to lactose (galactose-glucose). The density for the lactose moieties was weak, implying that these are flexible within the crystal. Only one of the six galactose rings in the asymmetric unit could be modeled. This molecule is located in between the two fiber head trimers in the asymmetric unit and forms a distant hydrogen bond (distance 3.25 \u00c5 ) to Lys503 via the galactose oxygen 6. It is unlikely that this interaction is enough to immobilize the galactose ring because the other five galactose moieties in the asymmetric unit are not equally well visible in the electron density.

The residues involved in binding (Asn435, Ser419, Ser416, Gln417 and Arg515) do not align with those involved in sialic acid-binding by HAd37 fiber head ( Figure  S2 ). The HAd37 sialic acid binding site consists of three residues forming hydrogen bonds (Tyr213, Pro317 and Lys345) and two residues contacting sialic acid in hydrophobic interactions (Tyr308 and Val322) ( Figure 3E ). All seven interactions between CAV-2 fiber head and sialic acid are hydrogen bonds or salt bridges ( Figure 3F ), suggesting a relatively strong interaction compared to HAd37. Unlike HAd37 fiber head [33] , no hydrophobic contacts contribute to sialic acid binding. Finally, sialic acid binds within a basic patch in each head ( Figure 3C and D).",

To determine if sialic acid and CAR binding were mutually exclusive, we soaked CAV-2 or HAd37 fiber head crystals in complex with CAR in solutions containing sialyl-D-lactose. Crystals containing the complex with CAV-2 fiber head diffracted to 2.9 \u00c5 and contained 12 chains of fiber head bound to 12 chains of CAR D1 and 12 sialyl-D-lactose molecules in the asymmetric unit (space group I422). Crystals containing the complex with HAd37 fiber head diffracted to 1.55 \u00c5 and contained one chain of fiber head in complex with one CAR D1 molecule and one sialyl-D-lactose molecule in the asymmetric unit (space group I23). For both structures the electron density maps showed clear density for sialic acid, but not lactose, at the expected positions on the fiber heads ( Figure 3G and H). Together, our data demonstrate that CAV-2 and HAd37 sialic acid binding sites do not overlap with the CAR binding sites, and both fiber heads can bind CAR and sialyl-D-lactose simultaneously.",

            "text": "Arnberg and colleagues previously showed that HAd37 interaction with sialic acid was inhibited at high salt concentration [33] . To determine if a CAV-2-erythrocyte interaction was at least partially charge dependent, we incubated a CAV-2 vector expressing GFP (CAVGFP) or a HAd5 vector expressing GFP (AdGFP) with mock-or neuraminidase-treated erythrocytes in PBS containing increasing concentrations of ions. We then pelleted the erythrocytes by centrifugation, removed an aliquot of the supernatant, added it to cells, and assayed the cells for GFP expression by flow cytometry 24 hr post-infection. Using mocktreated erythrocytes (Figure 4 ), we found that at physiological salt concentrations ,80% of CAVGFP was removed from the supernatant, while at higher salt concentration (300 mM NaCl) ,60% of CAVGFP was removed. When using neuraminidasetreated erythrocytes, we again found that CAVGFP was efficiently removed from the supernatant. All the test samples were Figure 2 . Binding of wild type and mutant fiber heads to human erythrocytes. A. HAd37 fiber head binding to erythrocytes (mock-treated, top panels or neuraminidase-treated, bottom panels) as measured by flow cytometry. The shadowed profile = mock-treated erythrocytes without fiber heads. The line graphs correspond to four 10-fold dilutions (13, 1.3, 0.13 and 0.013 mM) of three HAd37 fiber heads: HAd37 wt = wild type, HAd37 SA21 and HAd37 SA22 contain mutations in the HAd37H sialic acid binding domain. The lowest dilution (0.013 mM = the dotted line in the top left panel. The darkest line (furthest to the right in the top left panel) = 13 mM. Except for the modest binding of 13 mM HAd37 SA22 to neuraminidase-treated cells (bottom row middle panel), no other notable binding could be detected and therefore the line profiles overlap or are hidden by the shadowed mock-treated profile. B. Fluorescently-labeled CAV-2 fiber head (CAV2H wt ) binding to mock-treated (left) or neuraminidasetreated (right) erythrocytes as measured by flow cytometry. Three 10-fold dilutions of CAV2H wt (13, 1.3 and 0.13 mM) covalently labeled with Cy5 were assayed. The shadowed profile = mock-treated erythrocytes without fiber heads. As above the highest concentration of fiber head is in the darkest line profile. All assays were performed at least twice in triplicate. doi:10.1371/journal.ppat.1000277.g002 significantly (P,0.01) different from the control, as well as from the mock-treated 150 mM NaCl (P,0.05). Consistent with other studies [29, 34] AdGFP was also efficiently (90%) removed from the supernatant after the incubation with mock-(or neuraminidase-) treated erythrocytes.",

Similarly, His-tagged CAV-2 fiber head forms multimers of a defined size that are stable on a sizeexclusion column and can be visualized with an electron microscope (not shown). Removal of the His-tag yields single fiber heads. We found that His-tagged CAV-2H wt agglutinated erythrocytes, while His-tagged CAV-2H SA21 and CAV-2H SA22 (two CAV-2 fiber heads with one or two mutations in the sialic acid binding site, see Table 2 ) showed reduced hemagglutination titers.

We found that hemagglutination could be .256-fold reduced by preincubating CAV-2 with anti-fiber head antibodies, or preincubating erythrocytes with CAV-2H wt (see Figure 5A for specific example and 5B for cumulative data). Pre-incubating the erythrocytes with the head from HAd5 or performing the assay in 225 mM NaCl led to modest 2 to 4-fold reductions.

Among other functions, CAR acts as a homodimeric cell adhesion molecule at tight gap junctions [37] . However, the expression of cell adhesion molecules during erythropoiesis is not unprecedented [38] . Erythrocytes from some species express cell adhesion molecules during the early stages of differentiation that are thought to be involved in interaction with macrophages. We therefore incubated erythrocytes with anti-CAR antibodies that recognize the extracellular domain of CAR and assayed expression using flow cytometry. We found low, but reproducible, CAR expression on the cell surface of human erythrocytes ( Figure 6A ). To assay CAR expression using another approach, we used western blot analysis to screen erythrocytes from several species. Using an anti-CAR Ab that recognizes the cytoplasmic domain of CAR we found CAR expression on human and rat, but not on mouse, dog, rabbit and nonhuman primate erythrocytes ( Figure 6B and data not shown).

On the other hand, CAR has been expressed on erythrocytes using a transgenic mouse line (GATA1-CAR) with the CAR cDNA downstream of the globin transcription factor 1 promoter [28] . Using flow cytometry and western blot analysis ( Figure 6A & B) , we compared the levels of human CAR expressed by GATA1-CAR and human erythrocytes. We then repeated the hemagglutination assays using erythrocytes from control (C57BL/ 6) and GATA1-CAR mice. We also found that CAV-2 agglutinated GATA1-CAR erythrocytes at a low particle-to-cell ratio ( Figure 6C ), while there was no agglutination of C57BL/6 erythrocytes. Equally important, competition assays with recombinant CAV-2 fiber heads gave profiles that were similar to when we used human erythrocytes ( Figure 6D , and data not shown).",

In a number of conditions and approaches we showed that hemagglutination by HAd37 depends primarily on sialic acid binding. First, removing sialic acids from erythrocytes with neuraminidase eliminated erythrocyte cross-linking by HAd37 and a chimeric capsid harboring the HAd37 fiber head. Likewise, pre-incubation with neuraminidase significantly reduced hemagglutination caused by protein complexes containing multiple copies HAd37 fiber heads. Second, mutating single residues in the sialic acid binding sites reduced the hemagglutination activity of these protein complexes. Third, wild type HAd37 fiber heads bound more efficiently to erythrocytes or glycophorin than those carrying a point mutation in the sialic acid binding site. Our binding assays using wild type and mutated HAd37 heads also suggested that the sialic acid affinity is partially charge-driven. In addition, although HAd37 head also binds CAR [24] , in the context of the virus it does not appear to use CAR as a receptor, possibly due to its relatively short fiber. Therefore, CAR on erythrocytes is likely to be less important for HAd37 biodistribution.",

CAR expression by erythrocytes leads to CAV-2 induced agglutination. A.

As the CAV-2 fiber head is less positive than HAd37 fiber head (pI's of 8.4 and 9.2 respectively), this could have explained the lower affinity. The affinity between virus proteins and sialic acid is usually in the millimolar range; therefore it was conceivable that the affinity of single CAV-2 fiber heads to erythrocytes or glycophorin was low. Consistent with this assumption, we previously found that CAV-2 is more neutrally charged than other Ads [32] . Paradoxically though, CAV-2 agglutinates at a lower particle-to-cell ratio than HAd37 and our crystallography data suggested that sialic acid binding should be at least as strong as HAd37.

Our study suggests that this may be due to i) an interaction with different chemical variants, linkages and ratios of sialic acid, ii) the presence and affinity to CAR, and/or iii) the pI's of the head [33] . For example, some non-CAR-tropic Ads that agglutinate human erythrocytes may preferentially bind Neu5AC, the most abundant sialic acid on human erythrocytes. With respect to charge, both HAd37 and HAd19p bind sialic acid with equal affinity and the only two residues that differ between their heads are not close to the sialic acid-binding site [33] . With the limited amount of data available, subgroup D HAds tend to have heads with higher pI's and interact with sialic acid [33] . Interestingly, the residues that make up the CAV-2 sialic acid binding site are conserved in the CAV-1 fiber head (data not shown), suggesting a conserved sialic acid binding function. With respect to CAR affinity, the CAV-2 fiber head binds human CAR with the highest affinity of any fiber head known [24] , which may favor its efficient hemagglutination. In contrast to other Ads, higher temperatures poorly inhibit CAV-2 hemagglutination [12] , again suggesting a role for the high-affinity attachment to CAR. This is also consistent with a rather large difference between HAd5 and CAV-2 hemagglutination: to the best of our knowledge the HAd5 head does not harbor a sialic acid binding site and its pI (6.25) is less basic than HAd37 or CAV-2. Finally, we cannot exclude a role of the inter-and intra-species differences in the quantity of CAR expressed by erythrocytes.",

It is paradoxical that HAd37 binds CD46, sialic acid and CAR -yet does not use CAR [25] -while CAV-2 binds both sialic acid and CAR and to the best of our knowledge uses only CAR as a receptor [5] . We cannot exclude the possibility that in some cell types sialic acid binding provides a first low-affinity attachment to the cell surface, while CAR-binding is followed in a second step, providing a high-affinity binding. Similar two-step mechanisms have been proposed for other viruses [46] . It is tempting to speculate that sialic acid binding may play a role in the preferential transduction of neurons by CAV-2 vectors [47] [48] [49] [50] .

HAd DNA is routinely found in human blood cells by PCR. It is also a common misconception that Ads are rapidly cleared following a classical immune response. Numerous clinical cases strongly suggest that latent HAds can readily resurface if the host is immunosuppressed. The fate of particles that stick to erythrocytes under natural or artificial (i.e. vector injections) conditions is probably complex. For example, HAd5-induced liver disease in immunocompromised humans is relatively common. In contrast, immunocompromised nonhuman primates are rarely diagnosed with simian Ad (SAV)-induced liver disease [54] . Does CAR expression on erythrocytes lead to an advantage for host or virus? Has CAR expression on erythrocytes put a selective pressure on Ads (and coxsackie B viruses that also bind CAR) to avoid an erythrocyte virus trap [28] ? Or has CAR expression by erythrocytes allowed HAds to thrive because it has allowed open access to so many more tissues and cell types?",

In addition, we provide new insights into virus-erythrocyte interactions that will allow us to better understand HAd pathogenesis and facilitate the engineering of safer, more efficient gene transfer vectors. Although in most in vivo scenarios hemagglutination per se is unlikely to occur due to the turbulence that erythrocytes encounter in the circulation, sequestering of vector particles by erythrocytes must diminish gene transfer efficacy. Interest in Ad biology is continually growing due to the increasing incidence of HAd-induced morbidity and mortality during immunosuppression [55, 56] , and because Adderived vectors are the most commonly used vectors in gene therapy clinical trials. The identification of fiber head mutants that do not bind human erythrocytes may be of interest. Equally important may be the need to screen fiber heads from other serotypes for sialic acid and CAR binding domains. Combined with HAd interactions with vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors [39] , our study adds another critical element in the interaction with blood components, biodistribution and pathogenesis.",

In a second PCR reaction, fragment 1 was annealed to fragment 2 or 3 using primers AAT AAT GAA TTC TCA TTC TTG GGC AAT ATA GG and AAT AAT CCA TGG CCA AGC GAG CTC GG. The resulting longer fragments coded for complete mini-fiber containing HAd3 tail+shaft and either wild type or mutant (K345E) HAd37 fiber head.
