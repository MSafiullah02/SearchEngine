It has been all along evident that the arboviruses constitute a heterogeneous set when the properties of the virion and the activity of the virion at the cellular level are considered. Since in the various systems of viral classification advanced (Lwoff et al., 1962; Committee, 1965; Melnick and McCombs, 1966; Gibbs et al., 1966; Bellet, 1967) the properties of the virion are the only, or main, basis for classifying, it follows that the arboviruses cannot as an undivided body be incorporated in those systems. The solution was to dismantle the arbovirus set and redistribute its parts into the pertinent groups of the universal system.",

Junin virus has been isolated from mites on a few occasions (Mettler, 1969); Tacaribe from mosquitoes once (Downs et al., 1963); and Amapari on a few occasions from mites taken off rodents that were aviremic at the time (Woodall, personal communication, 1968). With these exceptions, there is nothing in the epidemiology of the diseases that indicates arthropod transmission to man or between lower animals; determined efforts to isolate Machupo virus from arthropods in the course of a large epidemic failed (Kuns, 1965), while its presence in the urine of chronically infected rodents points to a different mode of transmission than by the bite of an arthropod (Johnson, 1965). In view of the importance of the human diseases involved, inclusion of this antigenic group with the arboviruses is of more than passing importance and should no longer be done unless there is definite evidence in its favor. As it now stands the evidence fails to support an arthropod cycle in the maintenance of the viruses, nor do they appear to fit the definition of an arbovirus by any of the currently accepted criteria.",

In the latter case the virus would eventually lose its potential to multiply in arthropod vectors. There are instances in which arthropod-borne viruses can maintain themselves, in limited conditions, in nature in the absence of an arthropod vector, for example, EEE in pheasants (Holden, 1955); VEE in man (Brice\u00f1o-Rossi, 1964), and group B tick-borne encephalitis (CETB) virus between cow and man by the ingestion of contaminated milk (Blaskovic, 1967).",
