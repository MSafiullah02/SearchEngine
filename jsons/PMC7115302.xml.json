Policies to address routine respiratory pathogens (eg, tuberculosis [TB] and influenza A), emerging pathogens (eg, SARS or avian influenza), and bioterrorist agents are necessary. The CDC has provided detailed recommendations about health care facility response preparedness for a SARS outbreak (available online at http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/sars/guidance/C/recommended.htm). Although these may not all be generalized to every new respiratory threat, the principles described in the reference can guide institutional preparation for any large-scale respiratory pathogen threat. Similar readiness plans for bioterrorism preparedness have been devised and published conjointly by the CDC and the Association of Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology.12\n",

Community isolation and treatment facilities may also be activated; a prototype for such a facility was developed by the CDC for SARS. In general, community facilities will likely house and treat patients with milder disease, with the public health department coordinating these procedures and venues. Community isolation facilities (eg, motels, hotels) should have rooms that are equipped with private bathrooms, as well as receptacles to dispose of soiled linen and contaminated waste. Personnel who work at the facility should also have N-95 respirators available, as well as disposable gowns and gloves. In general, patients at these facilities will be expected to care for themselves.15 Other hospital infection-control procedures may involve cohorting potentially infectious patients (if isolation beds are not available), as well as rapidly discharging appropriate inpatients and canceling elective procedures to alleviate strain on hospital resources.",

Lack of resource planning was cited as a significant factor that contributed to the spread of SARS in Southeast Asia and Toronto.16 Unfortunately, few recent data exist describing the availability of isolation facilities in US EDs. A 1995 study found that less than 20% of EDs had negative-pressure isolation rooms.17 In a recent press release from November 2005, American College of Emergency Physicians leaders warned that there is an urgent need for increased ED and hospital planning, specifically citing lack of adequate surge capacity, isolation facilities, and staff to treat the large increase in the number of patients that may result from an influenza pandemic.18 Depending on the circumstances of the outbreak, public health officials may recommend keeping suspected noncritical infectious patients at home. The CDC\u2019s guidelines for home isolation for SARS and pandemic influenza serve as prototypes.19, 20 Alternatively, specific health care facilities may be designated as referral centers for suspected cases.15 Although the public health department will ultimately be responsible for coordinating implementation of these types of large-scale overcapacity plans, emergency physicians need to understand the types of options available. ED physician participation in policy development will be critical in providing practical guidance for ED patient care and operations.",

Effective communications mechanisms between EDs and health departments are required to allow contact tracing of potentially exposed patients, visitors, and health care workers who live in the community. Contact tracing involves either active or passive monitoring. Active monitoring consists of direct public health contact (telephone or in person), for example, once a day for exposed persons to assess for symptoms and address any needs. Passive monitoring relies on the affected person\u2019s contacting the health authorities if symptoms develop. Methods of monitoring depend on the exposure risk and capacity of the public health infrastructure. Regardless of the type of monitoring recommended, all individuals in contact with a potentially infectious person need to be advised of symptoms and what to do if symptoms develop. Additionally, persons with high-risk exposures may require activity restrictions. Although the public health department would be responsible for the contact tracing process, emergency physicians need to understand these basic principles because they will likely be called on to work closely with public health departments and provide information about persons who are infected or exposed while in the ED.

Consistent application of these principles demonstrated success in limiting TB resurgence more than a decade ago and, more recently, the spread of SARS.21 Understanding the hierarchy allows comprehensive planning, clear implementation, and appropriate local adaptations. The most effective practices from each category should be implemented according to characteristics of the responsible agent. For instances in which the infectious agent is unknown, the most restrictive isolation methods available should be instituted. Emergency physicians\u2019 preparedness thus requires understanding of institutional resource availability and capacity and early initiation of infectious disease or public health consultation if a new outbreak is suspected or institutional capacity is at risk of being overwhelmed.

Research has demonstrated that influenza vaccination of health care workers contributes to a substantial decrease in patient mortality,32 which has led some experts to call for mandatory vaccination of health care workers.33 The CDC provides specific recommendations about when to provide chemoprophylaxis for influenza,34 which may be used as a template and adapted to other pathogens when guidelines are developed for new and emerging pathogens for which vaccines are available. Vaccinations plans for certain agents (eg, anthrax and smallpox) are controversial. Currently, preexposure anthrax vaccine is not recommended for health care workers. After the terrorist attacks of 2001, the US government developed a smallpox vaccination plan that included \u201cformation of smallpox response teams\u201d at each institution. Emergency physician volunteers participated as critical members of the team. Although controversy still exists in the emergency medicine community about these recommendations,35 they remain. Because the threat of a true smallpox event remains low, however, routine vaccination for all health care workers for smallpox is not recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practice.36 Facilities should create a priority list for employee smallpox vaccination in the event of an outbreak, and emergency staff should be included.",

In the absence of person-to-person transmission of SARS worldwide, the goal of domestic surveillance is to maximize early detection of cases while minimizing unnecessary laboratory testing and social disruption. In the absence of known transmission worldwide, the overall likelihood that a person in the United States with fever and respiratory symptoms will have SARS is exceedingly low.45 If SARS transmission is present in limited geographic areas, screening should focus on identifying persons with possible geographic exposures. When person-to-person SARS transmission is present in the community, everyone with fever or respiratory symptoms should be screened for SARS.",

The implications of quarantining a population or individuals for the length of the incubation time (or the length of the illness if patient is infected) are numerous.
