This case definition facilitated inclusion of even mild symptomatic illnesses. Subjects with eligible illnesses attended an illness visit within 7 days of illness onset and had a combined throat and nasal swab specimen (or nasal swab specimen only, for children aged <3 years) collected for identification of virus etiology. During the first, second, and third surveillance periods, 96%, 95%, and 92% of reported ARIs, respectively, had a specimen collected for virus identification; only ARIs with a specimen available for laboratory testing were included here for analysis. Illnesses were followed for collection of data on illness characteristics, including whether the subject sought medical care; documentation of healthcare contact for treatment of ARI was also noted based on medical record review.",

The ARI outbreaks were similarly intense in the approximately 30-week surveillance periods in study years 1 and 3 and considerably milder in the shorter (23 week) period in year 2. Influenza virus circulated intensively from January through April 2011 (year 1), sporadically from February through April 2012 (year 2), and with moderate intensity but far longer duration from November 2012 through April 2013 (year 3). Influenza A(H3N2) virus, 2009 pandemic influenza A(H1N1) virus, and influenza B virus cocirculated in year 1, influenza A(H3N2) virus predominated in year 2, and influenza A(H3N2) virus and influenza B virus cocirculated in year 3. Each year, rhinoviruses and coronaviruses were both frequently identified throughout surveillance periods. Peak circulation of rhinoviruses occurred in October\u2013November in year 1 and February\u2013March in year 3; peak circulation of coronaviruses was during the winter months either immediately prior to or consistent with peak influenza virus circulation. In study years 1 and 3, coronavirus types NL63 and OC43 predominated throughout, with types HKU1 and 229E occurring less frequently and later in the season; in year 2, all 4 types circulated with similar frequencies. Parainfluenza viruses and adenoviruses circulated at relatively low levels in study years 1 and 2, with modest increases in activity for both in year 3; parainfluenza virus infections (42% due to type 2 and 51% due to type 3) were primarily identified from October through December, and adenovirus infections were identified at low frequency throughout the surveillance periods. RSVs circulated for extended periods in study years 1 and 3, and the timing of peak activity was similar to peak influenza activity in those years; RSV circulation was less intense and of shorter duration in year 2. In all 3 study years, the timing of peak HMPV circulation was consistent with the timing of influenza virus circulation.\n",

The estimated contribution of tested respiratory viruses in producing ARIs each season was examined and compared by age-category and likelihood of seeking medical attention; frequencies were pooled across surveillance periods and are presented in Table 4. The specific viruses causing ARIs were most likely to be identified in children aged <5 years (77% of ARIs were etiologically confirmed) and least likely in adults aged 18\u201349 years (46% were etiologically confirmed). Rhinoviruses and coronaviruses were the most frequently identified viruses in all age categories (21% and 16% overall, respectively), with coronaviruses more frequent than rhinoviruses in adults; ARIs caused by these viruses and ARIs with no agent identified were least likely to be medically attended. Conversely, ARIs caused by influenza B virus and adenoviruses were least frequently identified overall but were most likely to be medically attended. Among older children (age, 12\u201317 years) and adult subjects, other than ARIs caused by rhinoviruses and coronaviruses, influenza A virus and RSV were the viruses most frequently identified. ARIs caused by HMPV and parainfluenza viruses were similarly prevalent, most frequently identified in young children and intermediate in terms of being medically attended. Overall, 10% of ARIs had \u22652 coinfecting viruses identified; 67% of infections involving adenoviruses, 41% involving HMPVs, and 32% involving RSVs had other coinfecting viruses identified. Among ARIs with at least 1 virus identified, 16% had 1 or more coinfecting viruses identified; coinfection was most likely to occur in young children (23%).\n",

This was despite the concern that social changes might have altered the frequency of illnesses and transmission characteristics; previous observations had formed the basis of strategies for control of an influenza pandemic, which would make initiation of such studies desirable. There have also been recent major improvements in the determination of illness etiology, driven by the development of the RT-PCR assay [10\u201312]. This technique has increased the sensitivity of virus detection and expanded the ability to detect viruses now known to cause ARIs (eg, HMPVs and new coronaviruses) [22\u201326]. RT-PCR is also more easily and reliably performed than isolation of virus in cell culture or serology, both of which were used extensively in past studies to determine etiology [21, 27\u201329].",

We concentrated surveillance on the period when we expected influenza virus to be circulating, but we also extended this period so that occurrence of other viruses, when influenza virus was not circulating, could be determined. In fact, the period covered would include most of the annual time of increased transmission of respiratory viruses in general. We used an ARI case definition more rigorous than that used in the Tecumseh study [6] and required that ill individuals come to the research study site to have specimens collected. This could partially explain the lower frequency of illnesses currently identified. However, the overall patterns of illness frequency observed here were similar to those observed previously. Specifically, ARI frequency declined with increasing age in childhood, and increased among young adults with exposure to children [21, 27, 29]. However, even if it were possible to annualize the total age-specific frequencies of illnesses seen, they would be lower than those seen in the older studies [5, 21, 27, 29]. There could be many explanations for this, including changes in living conditions and implementation of vaccination programs, in addition to differences in study design. Indeed, such differences related to design were demonstrated within the Seattle Virus Watch, a classic household study [8]. The trade-off between intensively following a small number of households and less intensive surveillance of larger, more diverse households has been previously recognized [30].",

Rhinoviruses were the most commonly identified viruses in the original and current studies, even though the surveillance periods in the current study did not include the period immediately following opening of schools, when that virus predominates [31\u201333]. Coronavirus infections were documented in the Tecumseh study only by means of serology; at that time, only 229E and OC43 were recognized, with the latter being more common [28, 34]. Now, NL63 is a commonly identified coronavirus, with HKU1 similar in frequency to 229E [22\u201324]. It had been suspected that the role of coronaviruses in common respiratory infections had been underestimated, and our findings support that hypothesis. RSVs, HMPVs, and parainfluenza viruses are mainly thought of as childhood viruses [26, 35\u201338]; while they were more common in young children, they were found in all age groups and were intermediate in requiring medical attention. Too few parainfluenza viruses were detected to note the alternative patterns of serotype circulation seen previously [36, 39]. During the 3 seasons, 274 influenza viruses were identified, mainly in years 1 and 3, despite vaccination coverage of approximately 60% [17]. Medical consultation was higher for influenza B virus than for influenza A virus; this may be a reflection of the higher frequency of type B seen in children.",

This was particularly the case in younger children and especially with adenoviruses, but we also observed substantial coinfection with HMPV and RSV. It will be challenging to separate long-term shedding, which is probably the case with adenovirus, and potentially incidental coinfection, which may be the case with some other viruses (eg, rhinoviruses), from actual relation to the current illness [40]. Frequent identification of coinfecting viruses has also been demonstrated in studies involving medically attended ARIs [41]. Other studies, involving day care attendees, have found no relation between the number of infectious agents identified and illness severity [42], an observation in line with our finding of coinfection even in those with nonmedically attended illnesses.",

Comparison with the older studies shows more similarities than differences in terms of patterns of illness occurrence. While the absolute frequency of illnesses may have decreased, young children are still the individuals most frequently infected. Coronaviruses have now joined the rhinoviruses in causing most illnesses, and medical consultation remains a good indicator of illness severity [27]. The PCR technique has detected a new issue, virus coinfection. The etiological role of each virus identified will need to be examined, perhaps by specimens collected early and late in the illness. This type of household study is logistically challenging but permits not only the observations reported here, but also, for example, longitudinal analyses of interactions between viruses that could affect subsequent infection risks. As is illustrated by the year-to-year variation observed [29], evaluations need to be performed over time, allowing the maximum use of the data collected.",
