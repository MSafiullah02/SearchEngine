However, even in acute leukemia, the malignancy with the highest frequency of infection, very little was published about infectious complications until the second half of the twentieth century. The paucity of published data is illustrated by a book on acute leukemia, published in 1958, which made no mention of infectious complications [1]. Indeed, at that time, some physicians attributed fevers in leukemia patients to a general hypermetabolic condition caused by the neoplasm.",

Nitrogen mustard caused responses in Hodgkin disease, aminopterin caused responses in acute leukemia, and methotrexate cured choriocarcinoma in women. The subsequent use of multiple drug combinations in acute lymphocytic leukemia and Hodgkin disease represented major advances [2]. Another important advance was the use of platelet transfusions to control and prevent hemorrhage in acute leukemia patients with thrombocytopenia [3]. In an autopsy study, the frequency of hemorrhage as a cause of death in acute leukemia patients decreased from 67 to 37% due to the use of platelet transfusions [4]. Unfortunately, infection remained a major cause of death. There have been many reviews of the subjects over the years, some with international contributors and continuity which are references here [5\u201311].",

Latent infections may be activated in the presence of waning immunity whether it be due to the disease itself or to the treatment. The classic example of this is reactivation of latent tuberculous in patients with treatment-induced helper T-cell dysfunction. Additional latent infections which may be activated, for example, are histoplasmosis, coccidiomycosis, disease caused by the Herpes group of viruses, toxoplasmosis, strongyloidiasis, and others. These demand consideration and many such as TB, herpes simplex, and strongyloidiasis can be effectively treated prophylactically. Recent travel or residence and hospitalization may expose patients to organisms which may incubate such as malaria after travel to an endemic area or colonization due to drug-resistant bacteria such as Klebsiella, Pseudomonas, and Stenotrophomonas species acquired during a previous hospitalization. Questions to investigate epidemiologic factors should include exposures at home along with work, habits, and hobbies. Also, a detailed history of recent and remote travel and recreational activities may provide clues for an otherwise improbable diagnosis. All of these can be a source of infection, some of which can be avoided with appropriate patient education.",

Surveys in the 1960s found that about 80% of patients with acute leukemia, 75% with lymphoma, but less than 40% of patients with metastatic carcinoma developed infection [12, 13]. There are a wide variety of factors that may impact on the susceptibility of cancer patients to infection [11]. Local factors such as tumor masses that may obstruct the bronchial tree or urinary tract and necrotic tumors in the gastrointestinal tract can result in infection. In an autopsy study of children with metastatic carcinoma, 80% of cases of pneumonia were associated with pulmonary metastases, aspiration, or tracheostomy [14]. Antibiotic therapy is often of limited efficacy in these types of tumors, unless the local predisposing factor can be removed.",

            "text": "Neutropenia is the most important predisposing factor and can be due to the disease or its therapy. While there were some reports of the role of neutropenia in infection, a detailed analysis of 52 patients with acute leukemia was published in 1966 [15]. This study demonstrated that the risk of infection was related to the degree and duration of neutropenia. The risk increased when the neutrophil count was less than 1,000/mm3, but increased substantially when it was below 500/mm3. Also, the risk of developing infection increased the longer the duration of neutropenia. One hundred percent of episodes of severe neutropenia (<100 PMN/mL) lasting 3 weeks or longer were accompanied by identifiable infection compared to 65% of episodes lasting one week. Neutropenia diminishes the likelihood of detecting characteristic manifestations of infection. One study compared physical findings of infection in a group of patients with severe neutropenia with a group with adequate neutrophil counts [16]. Only 8% of patients in the former group with pneumonia were able to produce purulent sputum compared to 84% in the latter group. Similarly, among patients with urinary tract infections, pyuria was found in 11 and 97%, respectively. In an autopsy study, it was demonstrated that many pulmonary infections were not detected on routine chest radiographs antemortem [17]. Likewise, among patients with gram-negative bacillary pneumonia, 85% of those with initially abnormal chest radiographs had >1,000 neutrophils/mL, whereas 81% with normal roentgenograms had <1,000 neutrophils/mL [18]. The lack of signs of infection in febrile neutropenic patients impairs the physician\u2019s ability to determine whether or not fever is due to infection. In one study of fever in neutropenic patients, physicians were required to conclude whether infection was present or not before instituting therapy [19]. The physician\u2019s initial diagnosis (infection or fever of unknown origin) was incorrect in 33% of the cases.",

            "text": "White blood cell (WBC) transfusions were initiated in an effort to improve the outcome of infections in severely neutropenic patients. Since it was difficult to collect sufficient neutrophils from normal donors, initially, patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia with high neutrophil counts were used as donors [20]. Later, the development of the continuous cell separating machine made it possible to collect adequate cells from normal donors [21]. Studies demonstrated that there was a direct relationship between the number of cells transfused and the increment in the recipient\u2019s neutrophil count. In one study of 128 neutropenic patients who had fever unresponsive to antibiotic therapy, 49% responded after WBC transfusions, including patients with pneumonia and gram-negative bacillary septicemia [22]. Unfortunately, potential adverse effects occurred in some recipients. In one study when WBC transfusions were administered with amphotericin B, 64% of patients developed acute dyspnea, respiratory deterioration, and new pulmonary infiltrates compared to only 6% of patients who did not receive amphotericin B [23]. Several other studies failed to observe this toxicity. Another potential adverse event primarily for bone marrow transplant recipients was acquisition of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection [24]. Reports of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) in a few recipients has led to routine irradiation transfused cells, but questions have been raised about adverse effects of radiation on the function of the transfused neutrophils. In a review of seven prospective randomized trials of WBC transfusions in neutropenic patients with infection, it was concluded that the transfusions were of some benefit in five studies but the number of patients in each study was small [25]. A problem with many was the ignoring of the number of neutrophils administered; hence, some patients received an inadequate dose. The use of WBC transfusions diminished by the 1980s because there was inadequate evidence of their efficacy from prospective comparative studies. However, there has been a resurgence of interest in increasing available neutrophils since recombinant myeloid growth factor granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) has become available. Administration of G-CSF to donors improves the number of neutrophils collected as well as increases their activity against infection [26].",

Because of the risk of infection during periods of chemotherapy-induced neutropenia, efforts were made to provide a sterile environment for these patients. The first type of unit was a bed surrounded by a plastic canopy with filtered air (Fig. 1.1). Later, laminar air flow rooms were designed [27]. These units provided filtered air, sterile water supply, sterile room, specially prepared food, and toilet facilities. The patients were given specifically prepared \u201csterile\u201d food and prophylactic oral and topical antibiotics. These rooms, air, food, and patients were carefully monitored for microbial contamination [28, 29]. The program reduced the frequency of infection and permitted the use of more intensive chemotherapy in the premyeloid growth factor era. Unfortunately, more intensive chemotherapy in this setting did not result in higher remission rates for several malignancies including acute leukemia [30], lymphoma [31], and sarcoma [32].

Exceptions were those with cellular immune defects due to the neoplasm such as Hodgkin\u2019s disease, who might present with cryptococcosis or those with multiple myeloma who might present with pneumococcal septicemia because of their decreased production of normal immune globulins. In the neutropenic patient, the organisms invading from the nasopharynx were usually Streptococcus pyogenes or Staphylococcus aureus (penicillin susceptible). From the orointestinal tract, Escherica coli and Klebsiella or Proteus species were responsible; these bacteria were sensitive to most available antibiotics during early 1950s. Gradually, but steadily, resistance developed in most of the organisms except S. pyogenes. S. aureus resistant to penicillin and Pseudomonas aeruginosa resistant to all antimicrobials except polymyxin appeared in the late 1950s [4, 33, 34]. Antimicrobial resistance developed over the years among the orointestinal isolates and the Gram-positive cocci increased to become predominate by the 1980s with MRSA and penicillin-resistant alpha streptococci appearing. Many of the effective anticancer treatment regimens result in neutropenia so that these types of infection remain a major problem in patients with neoplastic disease.",

Various transplantation procedures and GVHD along with treatments for them including cyclosporine, anti-thymocyte globulin, tacrolimus and adrenocorticosteroids induce defects which result in such opportunistic infections. The diseases are due to organisms from all categories including Salmonella spp., Histoplasma capsulatum, Leishmania spp., and CMV. In the early 1980s and with the advent of the AIDS epidemic, investigators with access to laboratories where T cells could be measured began systematic studies that revealed that patients with levels in the 200 range or lower would develop one or more of these opportunistic infections, especially PCP. It became apparent that as the T cells fell, it could be predicted which organisms would cause disease [8, 35]. Now with the measurements of endogenous cytokines, T-cell subset populations, and functional analysis, this is even more predictable and offers opportunities for treatment and prevention.",

In unusual circumstances such as suspected polyoma virus infection, electron microscopy may be used. New culture methods include isolator lysis centrifugation tubes which are used for continuous around-the-clock monitoring employing a fluorescent carbon dioxide detection system. An automated broth system can be used for quantitation by colony counts of centrifuged sediments and these systems are more sensitive for the isolation of some fungi, mycobacteria and Bartonella species. In addition, the broth can be examined by nucleic acid probes and HPLC for rapid organism identification. Automated broth Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) antimicrobial susceptibility tests yield more rapid results which can be entered into online computer systems for clinicians and recorded for antimicrobial susceptibility patterns for hospital infection control.

            "text": "Early studies of infection in patients receiving chemotherapy for hematological malignancies found that S. aureus developed resistance to penicillin. It became the predominant cause of fatal infection in neutropenic patients [4]. Once effective antibiotics became available for treatment of penicillin-resistant S. aureus, gram-negative bacilli emerged as the most common cause of fatal infections. Pseudonomas aeruginosa became a major cause of infections, especially among neutropenic patients [29, 37, 38]. Although polymyxin B and colistin were very active in vitro against the pathogen, they were ineffective for therapy in neutropenic patients and were of limited benefit in other patients. Their efficacy in neutropenic patients depended upon the recovery from neutropenia. The availability of carbenicillin, the first \u03b2 lactam with anti-pseudomonal activity, had a dramatic impact on the therapy of life-threatening Pseudomonas infections [39]. Other gram-negative bacilli emerged as significant pathogens, including Klebiella spp. and Serratia marcescens. Cephalothins were the first \u03b2 lactam available for the treatment of some of these infections [40]. Over the years, multiplicity of antibiotics has been developed including potent broad-spectrum cephalosprosins, carbapenims, and fluoroquinolones [41]. Despite these important advances, bacterial infections remain a serious threat to cancer patients, due in large part to the ability of organisms to develop resistance to multiple antibiotics. Recent increase in nonpseudomonal nonfermentative Gram-negative bacteria such as Stenotrophomonas maltophilia has been associated with difficult-to-treat healthcare-associated infections; these bacteria may also cause less severe community-acquired infections [42]; high-dose trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole remains the treatment of choice, although occasionally a multidrug-resistant organism poses a serious challenge [43]. Emergence and spread of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL) Enterobacteriaceae and recently identified carbapenemases producing Klebsiella species (KPC) and spreading to other gram-negative disease-associated bacteria herald alarming limitation in choice for effective antimicrobial therapy against these new groups of MDR-gram-negative bacterial infections [44].",

After multiple antibiotics became available and the potential for emergence of resistance became apparent, it became the standard practice to withhold antibiotic therapy in the febrile patient until the infecting pathogen was identified. However, early studies of antibiotic therapy for fever in neutropenic patients clearly indicated the importance of instituting antibiotic therapy promptly to neutropenic patients when they become febrile. It has been demonstrated that mortality rates increase substantially if therapy is not administered promptly. The choice of initial antibiotic therapy should provide broad-spectrum antibacterial coverage against gram-positive cocci and gram-negative bacilli. Most infections are caused by aerobic gram-negative bacilli and anaerobic infections tend to be uncommon. It is of critical importance for physicians caring for neutropenic patients to be aware of the common pathogens causing infections at their hospitals and their antimicrobial susceptibilities so that appropriate antibiotic regimens will be selected. Antibiotics that are bactericidal should be selected when possible. The greatest experience has been obtained with broad-spectrum \u03b2 lactams and aminoglycosides.

This discussion will focus on two infections with potentially serious consequences in neutropenic patients: typhlitis and perianal infections. Typhlitis or neutropenic enterocolitis is characterized by well-demarcated ulcers, hemorrhage, and large masses of organisms with few inflammatory cells usually limited to the cecum, but can be more extensive. Computed tomography scans provide superior images of the intra-abdominal organs and may be able to diagnose subclinical small bowel perforations, infected collections, and pneumatosis intestinalis, a serious complication which requires intense bowel management and presents as surgical dilemma [110]. Bacteremia occurs in 70% of patients. Therapy consists of broad-spectrum antibiotics, and anti-Candida agents, bowel rest, and decompression are important [110].",

Catheter infections are an important cause of delay in chemotherapy, hospitalization, cost of care, and deaths [111, 112]. Coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (CoNS) and other skin gram-positive bacteria are common pathogens. Catheter removal reduces risk of infection recurrences [113], and in patients with high-grade bacteremia or candidemia with or without hemodynamic compromise, the catheter should be removed immediately. A thorough evaluation for underlying endovascular infection such as septic thrombophlebitis may yield a source of persistent bacteremia, lack of complete response, and influence duration of systemic antimicrobial therapy. Factors that influence antimicrobial choice include (a) penetration of drug in the biofilm, (b) antimicrobial activity within the biofilm, and (c) activity against the nonplanktonic stationary phase of the microorganisms [114]. A detailed discussion of this important topic is presented in two chapters.",
