            "text": "Live, attenuated RNA virus vaccines are efficacious but subject to reversion to virulence. Among RNA viruses, replication fidelity is recognized as a key determinant of virulence and escape from antiviral therapy; increased fidelity is attenuating for some viruses. Coronavirus (CoV) replication fidelity is approximately 20-fold greater than that of other RNA viruses and is mediated by a 3\u2032\u21925\u2032 exonuclease (ExoN) activity that probably functions in RNA proofreading. In this study we demonstrate that engineered inactivation of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV ExoN activity results in a stable mutator phenotype with profoundly decreased fidelity in vivo and attenuation of pathogenesis in young, aged and immunocompromised mice. The ExoN inactivation genotype and mutator phenotype are stable and do not revert to virulence, even after serial passage or long-term persistent infection in vivo. ExoN inactivation has potential for broad applications in the stable attenuation of CoVs and, perhaps, other RNA viruses.",

From past pandemics, it is clear that highly pathogenic zoonoses are major threats to global human health, economic stability and national security 1-4 . SARS-CoV and swine influenza virus CA/04/09 H1N1 have caused substantial human morbidity and mortality in the 21st century. Similar to influenza, CoVs have a strong history of host shifting and cross-species transmission 5, 6 . In addition to the emergence of SARS-CoV in 2002, which caused 50% mortality in aged populations, several other human CoVs, such as HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-229E, probably emerged from animal reservoirs within the past 200 years 7, 8 . The sudden emergence of new respiratory viral pathogens from animals underscores the need for new, broadly applicable vaccine strategies that rapidly and rationally attenuate emerging zoonoses, especially to protect vulnerable populations in future outbreaks.",

High mutation rates generate considerable genomic diversity, allowing RNA viruses to rapidly adapt to changing environmental conditions and hosts 12 . Increased replication fidelity has been shown to reduce the virulence of poliovirus and chikungunya virus [12] [13] [14] and has been proposed as a strategy for live, attenuated virus design 15 . CoVs encode the largest known RNA virus genomes (26-32 kb) , exceeding the theoretical limits of viable RNA genome size 11 . Mutation rates are lower in CoVs than in other RNA viruses, approaching 2 \u00d7 10 \u22126 mutations per site per round of replication 16 . Nsp14, encoded in the viral replicase gene, contains a 3\u2032\u21925\u2032 exoRNase (ExoN) of the DEDDh exonuclease superfamily 17 . In addition to the CoVs, ExoN homologs are present in the members of the Nidovirales order, whose genomes are >20 kb, but are not present in the smaller arteriviruses (with genomes of 12-16 kb), suggesting that the ExoN had a crucial role in genome expansion 16, 18 . In vitro, 3\u2032\u21925\u2032 exoRNase activity has been demonstrated for recombinant SARS-CoV nsp14 (ref. 19) . We have engineered and recovered viable ExoN inactivation mutants from mouse hepatitis virus (MHV-ExoN) and SARS-CoV (Urbani background, SARS-ExoN). Both MHV-ExoN and SARS-ExoN inactivations are maintained stably for more than ten passages in vitro and have 15-to 20-fold increased mutation frequencies compared to wild-type MHV and SARS-CoV 16, 20 . Thus, ExoN has a crucial role in CoV RNA genome replication fidelity in vitro, probably by directly mediating or stimulating proofreading, a function previously unknown among RNA viruses 21 .",

We compared MAwt, which causes increased mortality and acute respiratory distress in young and aged mouse models [22] [23] [24] , and MA-ExoN in in vitro growth experiments (multiplicity of infection (MOI) = 0.1 PFU per cell). MA-ExoN showed a stable growth defect of less than 1 log (Fig. 1c) . When placed in direct competition, MA-ExoN was clearly less fit than MAwt over successive rounds of infection (Supplementary Fig. 1a,b) . At 6 h after infection (p.i.), MA-ExoN genome RNA levels were roughly equivalent to those of MAwt and were lower than those of MAwt at 12 h p.i.; by 24 h p.i., MA-ExoN genome RNA levels were approximately 10% of those of MAwt (Supplementary Fig. 1c) . Thus, the data suggest that MA-ExoN is able to initiate and establish replication efficiently through times of peak RNA synthesis (0-6 h) but has impaired accumulation, which manifests late in one round of infection and is amplified over multiple rounds. These results are consistent with accumulating defects resulting from a markedly increased mutation rate (see the Discussion section).",

Mice infected with either virus experienced dose-dependent weight loss (Fig. 2c) ; however, although lung titers were equivalent across all doses of MA-ExoN and MAwt on day 2 p.i., mice infected with MA-ExoN cleared the virus independent of inoculation dose, whereas mice infected with MAwt had begun to clear the virus from higher-titer infections more efficiently at day 4 p.i. than from lower-titer infections (Fig. 2d) . Additionally, whereas aged mice infected with MA-ExoN had no mortality, MAwt-infected mice had dose-dependent mortality (Fig. 2e) .

However, our results are consistent with the hypothesis that both stable and evolving defects resulting from the mutator phenotype have irrevocably attenuated MA-ExoN. These defects could include (i) mutations that impair or terminate translation, replication and transcription; npg (ii) mutations that impair or abolish protein functions; or (iii) changes in RNA polymerase processivity in the presence of an inactivated proofreading exonuclease. These combined impairments may be manifested with CoV ExoN mutants, as the high number of accumulated mutations per genome is unprecedented among viral mutator strains. Indeed, the phenotype observed with CoV ExoN inactivation is similar to those reported for other polymerase complexes with inactivated exonucleases, such as human mitochondrial DNA polymerase \u03b3 (pol \u03b3) 32,33 and bacteriophage T7 DNA polymerase [34] [35] [36] . In pol \u03b3 studies, the loss of proofreading was associated with impaired polymerase activity in a manner that was probably causal, impossible to uncouple and characterized by decreased speed, increased template dissociation and restricted access of nucleotides to the polymerase active site 32, 33 . For CoVs, the high levels of iterative amplification of both genomic and subgenomic RNA would further accelerate these deleterious processes by providing aberrant templates. The loss of ExoN proofreading would continuously generate new potentially attenuating alleles, and defective genomes and would reduce both genome fitness and the risks for primary and secondary reversions to virulence.",

Although our in vivo experiments with MAwt recapitulated many of the phenotypes observed in aged and immunocompromised human populations, additional testing of MA-ExoN as a vaccine in primates will be necessary to further confirm its stability in vivo 37 . Experiments in SCID mice with persistent MA-ExoN infection verified the accumulation of mutations across the genome without evidence for the selection of either phenotypic virulence-enhancing alleles or primary genotypic reversion. Viruses harvested after passage remained avirulent, supporting the conclusions that (i) selection for virulence is not occurring; (ii) selection is being outcompeted by the gradual accumulation of attenuating mutations in individual genomes or the population mutational swarm; or (iii) the mutant is unable to generate or select for either fast-growing or slow-clearing viruses that are also more virulent. Not surprisingly, we identified a limited number of polymorphisms in the MA-ExoN virus stock that we used in subsequent experiments. Viruses with and without these mutations were fully attenuated in vivo, and the mutations were also maintained in lungs in the same frequencies as in the virus stock, suggesting that they were not selected against during passage in vivo. Thus, no single mutation or polymorphism could be clearly linked to viral attenuation except for the ExoN inactivation.",

In addition, MA-ExoN harvested from persistently infected SCID mice retained an attenuated phenotype when re-inoculated into young BALB/c mice, suggesting that persistence does not select for virulence.

All experiments used n = 5 mice per virus per dosage per condition (if applicable) per time point, with the exception of experiments using immunocompromised mice, in which n = 3.",

Briefly, once individual, well-resolved viral plaques were visible, they were harvested by collecting the agarose plugs above them using a 200-\u00b5l pipette tip. Each agarose plug was dropped in 0.5 ml PBS, allowed to diffuse for 24 h at 4 \u00b0C and then applied to ~70% confluent monolayers of Vero cells in T25 flasks and incubated for 48 h at 37 \u00b0C. Infected cell monolayers were then harvested in 1 ml TRIzol. Firststrand cDNA was generated as described 41 . Amplicons of the viral genomes were generated as follows: for whole-genome sequencing (amplicons 1-13) and partial-genome sequencing (amplicons A-G, X and Y), the primer pairs indicated in Supplementary Table 4 were used in a 50-\u00b5l PCR reaction using Phusion polymerase (New England BioLabs). Five microliters of each PCR reaction were electrophoresed on agarose gels to verify the presence of correctly sized amplicons, and PCR products were purified using a Qiagen PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA). Amplicons were then sequenced using the corresponding primer sets for each amplicon, as indicated in Supplementary  Table 4 . Sequence results were analyzed using Geneious Pro 5.3.6 (Biomatters, Auckland, New Zealand) and Serial Cloner 2.1 (SerialBasics, http://serialbasics. free.fr/Home/Home.html).",
