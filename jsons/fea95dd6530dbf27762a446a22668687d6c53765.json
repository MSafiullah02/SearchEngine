More clinical investigations are needed. Objective The study was aimed to describe the clinical characteristics, laboratory parameters, and therapeutic methods of COVID-19 patients in Hunan, China. Setting The First Hospital of Changsha, First People's Hospital of Huaihua, and the Central Hospital of Loudi, Hunan province, China. Methods This was a retrospective multi-center case-series analysis. Patients with confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis hospitalized at the study centers from January 17 to February 10, 2020, were included. The following data were obtained from electronic medical records: demographics, medical history, exposure history, underlying comorbidities, symptoms, signs, laboratory findings, computer tomography scans, and treatment measures. Main outcome measure Epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatments. Results A total of 54 patients were included (51 had the common-type COVID-19, three had the severe-type), the median age was 41, and 52% of them were men. The median time from the first symptoms to hospital admission was seven days. Among patients with the common-type COVID-19, the median length of stay was nine days, and 21 days among patients with severe COVID-19. The most common symptoms at the onset of illness were fever (74.5%), cough (56.9%), and fatigue (43.1%) among patients in the common-type group. Fourteen patients (37.8%) had a reduced WBC count, 23 (62.2%) had reduced eosinophil ratio, and 21 (56.76%) had decreased eosinophil count. The most common patterns on chest-computed tomography were ground-glass opacity (52.2%) and patchy bilateral shadowing (73.9%). Pharmacotherapy included recombinant human interferon \u03b12b, lopinavir/ritonavir, novaferon, antibiotics, systematic corticosteroids and traditional Chinese medicine prescription. The outcome of treatment indicated that in patients with the common-type COVID-19, interferon-\u03b12b, but not novaferon, had some benefits, antibiotics treatment was not needed, and corticosteroids should be used cautiously. Conclusion As of February 10, 2020, the symptoms of COVID-19 patients in Hunan province were relatively mild comparing to patients in Wuhan, the epicenter. We observed some treatment benefits with interferon-\u03b12b and corticosteroid therapies but not with novaferon and antibiotic treatment in our study population.",

The mild group refers to mild clinical symptoms, and no sign of pneumonia is found in chest computed tomography (CT) imaging. The common type refers to patients with fever, respiratory symptoms, and the sign of pneumonia in CT scanning. Severe COVID-19 patients present with any of the following: (1) shortness of breath, plus respiratory rate \u2265 30 breaths/min, (2) in resting state, oxygen saturation (SpO2) \u2264 93%, and 3) arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2)/Fraction of inspiration oxygen (FiO2) \u2264 300 mmHg.

Specific steps are as follows. Throat swab samples were collected from patients suspected of having SARS-CoV-2. After collection, samples were placed into a collection tube with 150 \u00b5L of virus preservation solution, and total RNA was extracted within 2 h using a respiratory sample RNA isolation kit. Then, a PCR reaction mixture containing 26 \u00b5L of PCR action buffer and 4 \u00b5L enzyme solution was added to 4 \u00b5L of the sample to perform RT-RCR. FAM (ORF-1ab region) and ROX (N gene) channels were selected to detect SARS-CoV-2, and the HEX channel was used for the internal standard. RT-PCR assay was performed under following conditions: incubation at 50 \u00b0C for 30 min and 95 \u00b0C for 1 min, 45 cycles of denaturation at 95 \u00b0C for 15 s, and extending and collecting fluorescence signal at 60 \u00b0C for 30 s. A cycle threshold value (Ct-value) of 40 or less for FAM or ROX channel was defined as a positive test result. Ct-values more than 40 for FAM and ROX channels and Ct-value of 40 or less for HEX channel were defined as a negative test. Also, Ct-values for FAM, ROX, and HEX more than 40 were defined as an invalid test result.",
