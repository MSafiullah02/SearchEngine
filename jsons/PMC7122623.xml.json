They tend to present in the sixth decade of life and are associated with increased surgical risk.6 They have a genetic component and are seen in patients with a familial history of AAAs. Inflammatory aneurysms are thought to arise from an immune response to an antigen in the adventitial wall. This antigen is unknown but is thought to be viral, a lipid, or a product of lipid peroxidation from atherosclerosis.7 Herpes simplex virus and cytomegalovirus have been identified in the aortic wall in patients with inflammatory AAAs.6 Patients with inflammatory AAAs are very symptomatic (back, flank, and abdominal pain) and have an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate.\n",

Early in aneurysm formation, there is fragmentation of elastic fibers, and, as the aneurysm develops, there is degradation of collagen, which is the ultimate cause of rupture. This process is mediated by proteolytic enzymes such as the matrix metalloproteins (MMPs) and plasmin-generated plasminogen activators.9 There is also a reduction in smooth muscle cells in the media, which participate in vascular wall remodeling and have a protective role against inflammation and proteolysis.10\n",

Sensitivity of abdominal palpation increases with the diameter of the lesion and decreases with abdominal girth.12 Radiologic imaging techniques such as abdominal ultrasound, computed tomography (CT), or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are the preferred modalities to diagnose AAAs. An AAA may be diagnosed on a lateral abdominal x-ray if calcifications are present, which may allow visualization of the dilated aorta. Abdominal ultrasonography is the simplest and least expensive diagnostic modality. It can accurately measure aortic size and can be used for diagnosis, follow-up surveillance, and screening.13 If there is an aneurysm detected on screening, the next step is to perform an abdominal CT to determine the type of treatment.14 Information that can be elicited from a CT includes visualization of the proximal neck, extension to the iliac arteries, patency of the visceral arteries, and the presence and thickness of a mural thrombus. CT can also detect anatomic variants such as a left vena cava, posterior left renal vein, or horseshoe kidney that may interfere with the procedure, and can reveal blood within the mural thrombus called the crescent sign, which may be a predictive marker of imminent rupture.15 In patients with inflammatory aneurysms, CT can estimate the thickness of the aortic wall and determine the presence of para-aortic fibrosis. CT can also be used to determine the suitability for placement of endovascular devices. (Figs. 14.1 and 14.2).\n\n",

This event is followed within hours by a larger rupture. The period between the two ruptures is called the intermediate period and is the time where the diagnosis and emergency repair can be accomplished.1 The triad of symptoms of an RAAA include sudden onset of mid-abdominal or flank pain radiating to the scrotum, circulatory shock, and the presence of a pulsatile abdominal mass. The presence of flank ecchymosis (Grey Turner sign) represents retroperitoneal hemorrhage. Diagnosis is mostly clinical, but ultrasound, CT or MRI scanning, or aortagraphy can also be helpful depending on hemodynamic stability. Contrast CT shows extravasation of contrast material, which is diagnostic of rupture. Early diagnosis reduces mortality by 50%. In rare cases, the first episode of rupture can be contained to become a chronic pulsatile extra-aortic hematoma or aneurysms can rupture into another structure, such as the duodenum, producing an aorto-duodenal fistula or the vena cava, which can lead to lower extremity edema.17\n\n\n",

EVAR decreased perioperative complications, including myocardial events, and was associated with decreased recovery times. In patients with large AAAs who are fit for OR, EVAR offers an initial mortality advantage over OR, with a persistent reduction in AAA-related death at 4 years. However, EVAR offers no overall survival benefit, is more costly, and requires more interventions and indefinite surveillance with only a brief Quality of Life (QOL) benefit.19 Open repair is more durable and does not require the extensive surveillance unlike endovascular repairs. This may lead to a better quality of life. The DREAM trial patients received QOL questionnaires preoperatively, then at 3 weeks, 6 months, and at 1 year. Preoperative scores were similar. At 3 weeks, the patients undergoing endovascular repair had a better quality of life, but at 6 months and 1 year, the patients undergoing the open repair reported a better quality of life.20\n",

The aortotomy is extended to the aneurysmal neck and the aorta transected. A tube graft repair is performed, first with the proximal anastomosis to the aorta. After the proximal anastomosis is completed, a second clamp is placed on the graft to assess the strength of the anastomosis under pressure. The distal anastomosis is then performed either to the distal aorta or iliac arteries. The iliac artery anastomosis is preferred over the common femoral artery anastomosis because the femoral anastomosis is more prone to infection.

Operative mortality following ruptured AAA repair may be divided into early and late deaths. The most frequent cause of early death is hemorrhagic shock while up to 90% of deaths after 24 h are caused by MOF. SIRS arises from the response to extensive surgical trauma, the release of vasoactive agents due to bowel manipulation and mesenteric traction, response to graft material, intestinal ischemia from intraoperative hypotension, aortic clamping and ligation of inferior mesenteric artery, ischemia-reperfusion injury, blood transfusions, which alter cytokine production, and cytokines released from the mural thrombus.",

Arterial blood gases are monitored frequently and any acid base, electrolyte, blood glucose, and hematocrit disturbances are corrected accordingly. A blood gas is always sent before unclamping and any abnormalities corrected.",

Release of the clamp causes blood sequestration in the previously ischemic lower extremities, central hypovolemia, and decreased blood flow to the critical coronary, renal, and hepatic circulations (Fig. 14.7). The use of vasopressors to increase the blood pressure without restoring blood volume may further decrease blood flow to these critical organs. Adequate volume loading prior to release of the clamp to a higher PCWP than the baseline value is recommended.70 Ueda et al.71 used volume loading with 10 ml/kg of albumin before unclamping during AAA repair and have shown that albumin did not prevent systemic hypotension, but significantly increased pulmonary artery pressure and right ventricular afterload causing RV dilatation. Cautious fluid administration is recommended in patients with cardiac dysfunction. Bitoh et al.72 reported left ventricular diastolic dysfunction, measured using the mitral annular velocity by tissue Doppler method, after unclamping in eight patients undergoing infrarenal AAA repair and the dysfunction persisted until the end of the surgery. Pulmonary edema occurred in two of their patients with the lowest tissue Doppler mitral annular velocity. Gradual release of the clamp is recommended to prevent adverse events after unclamping in such cases. Close communication with surgical team is essential.\n",

Bleeding may be related to inadequate hemostasis, coagulopathy, or excess heparinization. Techniques to reduce homologous blood transfusion are employed to reduce the transfusion risks and prevent the adverse effects associated with extensive stored blood therapy. Preadmission autologous blood donation (PABD) in combination with intraoperative autotransfusion (IAT) has been shown to eliminate the need for homologous transfusion in two thirds of elective AAA patients.80 Similar efficacy of PABD with IAT was demonstrated in aortic surgery when compared with IAT alone or with no conservation technique.81,82 Erythropoietin has also been used in patients undergoing preoperative blood donation.83 The routine use of IAT in all elective AAA patients is controversial. A meta-analysis of four randomized controlled trials examining the efficacy of IAT reported 37% reduction in risk of allogenic blood transfusion.84 Few other studies reported lack of efficacy and found this practice to be not cost-effective when applied to all AAA patients.85,86 While some surgeons use IAT routinely, few others consider it in selected operations where blood loss is likely to be high, such as RAAA, complex reconstructions, thoraco-abdominal aneurysms and suprarenal aneurysm surgery, or in patients with religious concerns.87 The disadvantages of the washed red cells are that they do not contain platelets or coagulation factors. TEG is utilized intraoperatively to detect and treat coagulopathy. Acute normovolemic hemodilution (ANH) has been used in combination with intraoperative cell savage (ICS) and found to be an effective strategy for AAA patients.88 Wolowczyk et al.89 in a randomized controlled clinical trial compared ANH with ICS to ICS alone in patients undergoing elective AAA repair and concluded that ANH did not reduce transfusion requirements and had no impact on systemic inflammatory response or overall outcome. Even without ANH, the large volumes of fluid infused as part of standard fluid management in these patients produced hemodilution, which is the reason why additional ANH is ineffective in saving bank blood.90\n",

Epidural analgesia with ropivacaine 0.1% or bupivacaine 0.125%, with hydromorphone 10 \u03bcg/cc is initiated before abdominal wound closure to facilitate extubation and pain relief in the immediate postoperative period. Initiation of epidural also controls the hyper\u00adtensive response associated with extubation. Typically, epidural analgesia is continued for 3\u20135 days. The superior analgesia by epidural is especially useful in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.96 In these patients, epidural analgesia decreases the duration of mechanical ventilation and the incidence of pulmonary complications.97 Epidural catheter insertion is not without risk. Epidural hematoma with paraparesis and iliopsoas hematoma with lumbosacral plexopathy have been reported with epidural analgesic use after AAA repair.98,99 Though these complications are rare when appropriate precautions are taken, the prognosis of these neurological complications can be serious. Postoperative monitoring of neurological dysfunction is an essential part of epidural analgesia.

            "text": "\nAn abdominal aortic aneurysm is a focal dilation of the aorta, is defined as an aortic diameter of at least 50% larger than normal or a diameter of greater than 30 mm.The majority of AAAs are infrarenal and are located several centimeters below the renal arteries. Pararenal AAAs are aneurysms that involve the renal ostia and include juxtarenal AAAs, which involve the renal artery origin and suprarenal AAAs, which involve the aorta above the renal arteries.AAAs associated with mural thrombi have increased coagulation and fibrinolytic activity, produce local hypoxia in the media, which can lead to neovascularization and inflammation.The majority of AAAs are asymptomatic and are discovered during routine screening. Ultrasound is the recommended screening modality CT or MRI are used to delineate the anatomy of the aneurysm, and aortography, the gold standard, is reserved for patients with inconclusive studies.For ruptured AAAs, the triad of symptoms include sudden onset of mid-abdominal or flank pain radiating to the scrotum, circulatory shock, and a pulsatile abdominal mass.Open AAA repair is recommended for the majority of pararenal aneurysms, aneurysms with an enlarged neck or significant angulation, and those with laminated thrombus at the stent-graft attachment. Open AAA repair does not require yearly surveillance as with endovascular techniques and is associated with improved patient quality of life as compared with endovascular repair.The surgical approaches to open AAA include the transperitoneal and retroperitoneal approach, including total and assisted laparoscopic techniques. The retroperitoneal approach is associated with decreased pain and perioperative complications, and is the approach of choice for pararenal aneurysms.SIRS, more common in patients with RAAAs, is associated with the release of endotoxin, which causes the release of inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6, TNF\u03b1, and IL-6\u03b2, leading to the development of ARDS and MOF.Advanced age, cardiac arrest with cardiopulmonary resuscitation, hypotension, loss of consciousness, low hematocrit, and elevated creatinine are associated with a poor outcome.Since up to half of patients with AAAs have underlying coronary artery disease and perioperative cardiac complications are the major cause of morbidity and mortality, these patients should be evaluated according to the 2007 ACC/AHA guidelines.Monitoring for patients with uncomplicated AAAs includes standard ASA monitors, along with arterial blood pressure, central venous pressure, and urine output. For high-risk patients, additional monitoring may include pulmonary artery catheterization and transesophageal echocardiography.The effects of aortic cross-clamping depends on the level of the clamp, the baseline myocardial function and presence of CAD, the type of aortic disease and degree of collateralization, volume status, and anesthetic technique.Aortic unclamping produces hypotension and acidosis, which is due to the release of vasodilating and myocardial depressant metabolites from ischemia and reperfusion. This can be treated with vasopressors, fluid administration, and reclamping, if necessary.The most important determinant of survival in patients with RAAA is time to aortic cross-clamp. The goals of anesthetic management in these include performing a rapid evaluation, including hemodynamic status, obtaining large bore intravenous access, obtaining blood and blood products for transfusion, and maintaining hemodynamic stability, with vasoactive agentsFluid and transfusion management for these patients should include fluid restriction and blood conservation techniques, including cell salvage. Patients with coagulopathy during AAA repair should be monitored with TEG and treated with blood products and factor VIIa, if necessary.Postoperative pain management in these patients is diverse and includes neuraxial analgesia with spinal opioids or epidural anesthesia, paravertebral analgesia, and intravenous patient-controlled analgesia.Although the most common perioperative complication is cardiovascular, other complications during AAA repair include renal, pulmonary, neurological, gastrointestinal, hemorrhage, DIC, and limb ischemia.\n",
