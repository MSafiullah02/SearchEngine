A large component of threat reduction for biological attacks involves the use of appropriate antibiotics and/or prophylactic vaccination. Application of these mitigating technologies requires some foreknowledge of the threat; hence, one component of microbial forensics is rapid identification of the threat. A second component of the microbial forensics is careful examination with the goal of attribution since encoded in the concept is a law enforcement application. In addition to the chapters in this book, there are several outstanding reviews which address the requirements and gaps in current bioforensics for human and plant biothreats [1\u20133]. One major difference in the application of forensic assays for public safety and for law enforcement is the requirement for speed and specificity. Assays which impact public safety must be rapid and be suitable for presumptive diagnostic purposes. Presumptive diagnostics are those which are used as an adjunct to clinical tests and to assist the physician in patient evaluation. Tests which can be used at point of care or at the scene are preferred so that rapid treatment or triage of susceptible populations can be emplaced where they will do the most good. Tests which describe attribution characteristics related to a crime can be slower but must be highly specific. This chapter describes the features of microbes which are used by microbiologists for identification and categorization of biological organisms and intrinsic features of bacteria which can be used in forensic applications for attribution.",

The structures assigned to bacteria \u2013 cocci (round), bacilli (rods), or spirochetes (corkscrew) \u2013 can be readily seen via light microscopy with no sample preparation. Generally, bacterial isolates are further differentiated at the time of microscopic examination by staining. The gram stain is one of the most useful and commonly used tools to differentiate bacteria beyond the genus level. This staining procedure named for its inventor, Hans Christian Gram, supplies both biochemical information about the composition of bacteria (see 10.1007/978-1-60327-219-3_3 for more detail concerning the biochemistry of bacterial cell walls) and special information regarding the distribution of chemicals within the cell.\n",

LPS lies internal to the cell wall and helps regulate the permeability of the cell among other functions. The first stain is crystal violet which stains all bacteria blue-purple followed by an iodine fixative. The critical step is then the decolorizer which is methanol. Methanol fixes the cells \u00adcausing the pores in the walls of gram-positive cells to collapse and become sealed thus retaining the blue dye. The methanol also dissolves the lipid portion of the cell wall of gram-negative cells causing them to become more porous and allowing the dye to leak out. At this point, gram-negative cells can be distinguished from gram-positive cells because they are clear. A red counter stain of fuchsin or safranin is used, giving the gram-negative cells a pink appearance to make their shape and size easier to see microscopically. The patterning of staining can be important in categorizing bacteria to the species level. For example, the staining pattern of the biothreat agent, Yersinia pestis is described as \u201csafety pin\u201d since the gram-negative rod-shaped bacteria stains pink with the exception of blue staining at the ends of the rods indicating the specific exclusion of LPS from apical ends.",

The newly emergent coronavirus, the causative agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), was identified first by electron microscopic examination of patient samples followed by the use of molecular tools for genetic and immunological identification [5]. Therefore, a toolbox for forensic analysis should include a combination of methods based on both classical methods and new molecular tools. High confidence can be assumed when these tests agree especially since the databases and signature libraries in general were built from and validated by organisms identified by classical methods. Thus, there is an internal dependence of the new tools on the results predicted by the older classical methods.",

As discussed in 10.1007/978-1-60327-219-3_3, fatty acid composition can be an important tool for microbial identification and strain distinction.

            "text": "Important to address is the issue of clonality in cultured materials. When isolating bacteria on plated media, most procedures are initiated from a single isolated colony on a plate. The incorrect assumption is that each colony arises from a single bacterial cell; however, in reality it can only be stated that a colony arose from at least one bacterial cell. Many organisms do not grow as isolated individual strains. The bacilli- and cocci-shaped microbes discussed above do not always grow as individual cells but may grow as chains or clusters, respectively. The average length of the chains or numbers in each cluster is a growth characteristic which is useful in distinguishing bacteria to the genus or species level. Both chain length and cluster size are influenced by culture media effects [9, 10]. Microscopic examination of cultures of Staphylococcus aureus show \u201cgrape-like\u201d clusters of cocci-shaped bacteria, the smallest of which is generally made of diplococci (two cells) and the largest is 12 or more cells. Without robust efforts to disassociate these clusters prior to plating, it is unlikely that a single colony of Staphylococcus has descended from a single cell. Hence, enumeration of bacteria by colony count (serial dilution followed by plating on growth media) is really only an estimate and frequently an underestimate of the total number of viable bacteria present. Depending on the viability of the sample, it may or may not reflect the number of target bacterial genomes present since polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based technologies (discussed below) do not differentiate between viable and dead cells. Better agreement is expected using direct counting via a Petroff Hauser chamber. The Petroff Hauser chamber is a low-tech solution in that it merely provides a calibrated area in which individual objects are counted microscopically. It does not discriminate between live or dead. Use of the Petroff Hauser chamber and colony counts can provide a good estimate of the health, i.e., relative viability of the sample.",

Unlike chemicals, bacteria and viruses are discrete units which sometimes adhere to each other or other materials present within a sample creating an uneven distribution and distortion of estimates of microbial targets when using indirect methods to evaluate concentration such as culture.

The ability to identify unculturable microbes further enhances the forensic analysis of a sample. Unculturable organisms may not be the target of concern for biocrimes since one of the underlying requirements for nearly all types of infectious agents is that they are easily cultured; however, contaminating unculturable microbes can provide information regarding comparative temporal and geolocation typing of microbial communities. At the species level and, in particular, at the strain level, the overall makeup of microbial communities can be extremely specific. Some microbes will persist in environments with few alterations for years, while other organisms will persist seasonally or be otherwise chronologically limited. In this case, both the dynamics and stability of the population contain useful information for comparative purposes. It is important to stress comparison when considering characterization of unculturable microbes since the application space afforded by characterizing microbial communities and its variations can be infinite. Culture-independent tools include the use of PCR, microarrays, and mass spectrometry (described below) to identify the presence of bacterial species.",

First described for Vibrio cholerae, VBNC states have been observed for Escherichia coli, Vibrio cholerae, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Campy\u00adlobacter jejuni, Helicobacter pylori, and bioterrorism agents such as Fransicella tularensis and Burkeholderia species (as reviewed in [13]). VBNC complicates environmental sample analysis when looking for source attribution in waste water, soil, or other environmental samples since standard culture methods do not apply.

These media are used to exclude the growth of nontarget organisms, accentuate visual features of the colony, or for gross biochemical assays which describe the enzymatic profile of the bacteria. For example, one classic test for Bacillus anthracis is the growth of the organism on sheep blood agar (SBA) plates. Lysis of the red blood cells in the agar is known as beta hemolysis and is carried out through the activation of the hemolysin enzyme. Hemolysis appears as a clear ring surrounding the colony on a dark red plate. Bacillus anthracis, unlike its near neighbor Bacillus cereus, is nonhemolytic on standard SBA plates. Notably, if red blood cells are washed prior to addition to the plate media, Bacillus anthracis colonies exhibit a clear zone around the colonies indicating hemolysin enzyme activity. Hemolysin genes are known to be promiscuous among bacterial species [14], so detection without functional assessment is not sufficient for microbial characterization. Point mutation analysis of the three-part hemolysin enzyme complex can be applied using genetic techniques, but in this case, a simpler and less costly biochemical screen for exclusion may suffice.",

            "text": "Early methods in bacterial identification made use of culture biology for identification. Carbon source utilization, synthesis of lipids, and oxygen requirements were standard methods for screening bacteria. So successful and well validated were these approaches in classical microbial analysis that several commercial enterprises simplified these tests reducing them from racks of test tubes to single 96-well-plate or credit-card-sized formats (Table 2.2). Two general biochemical types of assays are highlighted. The first compares the growth of organisms on a variety of simple substrates. Low-oxygen or oxygen-free conditions are replicated by the addition of mineral oil layers over the growth solutions. The combination of individual tests [15\u201345] is fed into any automated algorithm which compares the test outputs to a database of outputs for known microbes. The resulting test pattern is matched based on a best fit for microbial identification. These systems are generally used for speciation of bacteria but are typically unable to distinguish bacterial strains within the same species [46\u201349]. Since its development, 16S RNA analysis (see discussion below) has replaced many of these tests due to its accuracy and speed [15, 16]. An alternative biochemical assay uses Fatty Acid Methyl Ester (FAME) analysis to profile bacterial lipids. MIDI is an automated system which uses gas chromatography to determine the pattern of lipids which can be derived in a bacterial cell. Lipids found in the lipid bilayer of the cell membrane and attached to proteins and sugars are important regulators of specific bacterial cell functions and can be used to discriminate bacteria to the strain level. The advantage of FAME analysis is that it can be used for viruses, whereas the substrate utilization assays cannot [17\u201319].

In higher eukaryotes, \u00adspeciation is defined by the ability of two individuals to successfully interbreed. Failure to \u00adproduce offspring or failure to produce offspring capable of reproduction is indicative of two \u00addifferent species. Speciation in bacteria is much more nebulous. Originally, the morphological and biochemical differences between organisms were determined to categorize isolated bacteria into groups. Type strains are the strains which exhibit many typical characteristics of a species. Usually, type strains are among the first representatives to define the species and may not represent all of the most common feature of the species. Shape, size, and culture appearance all go into the morphological distinction of bacterial types. Most bacteria exist as actively growing cells called vegetative cells. Only a few subsets of bacteria are able to produce spores, viable but dormant structures which encapsulate the genome of bacteria. Spores enable bacteria to survive in unfavorable conditions until the correct growth requirements are detected, at which time the spore undergoes a process called germination where the spore breaks down and releases a replicating vegetative cell. Using classical microbiological methods, bacteria are further distinguished based on biochemical differences. In bacteria, sugar utilization and other nutrient requirements are noted. Many of the selective media that can be used to enrich mixed samples for a particular bacteria species are based on the restriction of carbon sources to a single type of sugar or preferred sugar which allows the target species to grow fastest, i.e., Yersinia agar which is selective for Yersinia spp. or PLET medium which is selective for Bacillus anthracis [21]. Appearance on specific agars (e.g., blood agar plates in which sheep or other mammalian red blood cells are added to a basic agar media such as tryptic soy broth) provides additional information.",

Recently, a rapid 2-h culture test for low-cost screening to rule out Bacillus anthracis exposure has been developed [20]. The test is based on the fact that Bacillus species exhibit differential beta hemolysis or zonal lysis and clearing of red blood cells surrounding the margins of a colony. Microscopic examination of cultures for gram-positive rods and spores coupled with the presence of active beta hemolysis is enough information to rule out the presence of Bacillus anthracis. Since tests such as these are indicators, it would seem simple to develop rapid DNA dipstick screens for the presence of the hemolysin gene to rule out Bacillus anthracis; however, as it turns out, Bacillus anthracis has a complete hemolysin gene. It is only when the red blood cells are specially washed prior to the preparation of the agar that beta hemolysis can be noted in Bacillus anthracis [22]. Hence, partial genetic characterization such as the presence or absence of a gene is not always definitive in microbial differentiation. In the case of exclusionary decisions regarding a sample, the absence of a gene may be sufficient to eliminate a sample from further analysis. For example, in a case of death due to a respiratory infection, the absence of any of the three toxin genes coding for the Bacillus anthracis toxins could rule out a sample as the cause of death even if other phylogenic markers indicate Bacillus anthracis is present.",

Therefore, a colony which appears as a single unit on a plate (or for viruses a single plaque) may arise from a single bacterium or virion. Once it becomes visible, a population of thousands of bacteria or virions is present. This may seem trivial; however, it becomes important when discussing genetic mutations and the application of human forensic tools to microbial forensics. If the average colony or viral plaque contains 105\u2013109 individuals and the average spontaneous mutation rate is 10\u22129 to 10\u221210 per base per generation of bacteria (viruses are somewhat higher, 10\u22124 to 10\u22128 [24, 25]), each colony or plaque will contain at least 3,000 individuals that are genetically different from the starting organism (Table 2.1).\n",

Speciation in other organisms is often represented by punctuated genetic differences, i.e., appearance of new genes, while in bacteria speciation, the distinction between species is more of a genetic continuum of dubious linearity. As noted by Carl Woese, \u201cone necessarily questions the universal phylogenetic tree. That compelling tree image resides deep in our representation of biology. But the tree is no more than a graphical device; it is not some a priori form that nature imposes upon the evolutionary process. It is not a matter of whether your data are consistent with a tree, but whether tree topology is a useful way to represent your data\u201d [27]. In other words, evolutionary trees and categorization of microbes into defined units is a tool and not necessarily the rule for defining bacterial identity. The presence of a new gene in a bacterium of known classification may indicate that the target has been in close proximity with other species and may provide forensic information about the life and/or residence of the microbe prior to its isolation and sampling. For example, the presence of partial genes from a soil bacterium found only in specific geological regions in a fairly ubiquitous pathogen may suggest the location where a bacterium was grown or isolated.

Glycosylation is the method by which small subunit sugars are linked to proteins and lipids in long and sometimes complex polymers. The ability of viruses and bacteria to recognize and invade a host is based on recognition of sugar polymers on target proteins [28\u201330]. The biochemical steps required for addition of specific sugars to proteins is evolutionarily restricted [31, 32]. Simple glycosylation is carried out in bacteria, more complex enzymology is encoded in eukaryotes, and enzymes making highly specific glycosylation linkages diverge in higher eukaryotes like Drosophila, mammals, and primates. Therefore, insects and mice make \u00addifferent branched sugar polymers. The appearance of unique sugar linkages can be used to identify which culture system was used to grow a viral preparation. Probing differences in glycosylation can be as simple as monitoring the differences in surface protein confirmation using epitope mapping via immunoassay, or a more detailed analysis can be conducted using ion trap mass spectrometry [33, 34].",

As a result, PCR has enabled countless new applications in human forensics, medicine, and agriculture by providing enough material for more robust analyses without the need for a living organism. PCR has been the subject of many excellent recent forensic reviews [1, 36, 48] and so will be discussed here relative to microbial applications. Briefly, PCR works by amplifying DNA or, in the case of reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR), amplifying RNA. This is possible due to the discovery of thermostable polymerases which retain their ability to extend short oligomers of nucleotides known as primers [37]. As for all DNA polymerases, a template is required in order for the polymerase to extend the new complementary DNA strand. Therefore, extension of the primer only occurs when the primer is bound to its DNA target. The number of DNA targets is limiting in the reaction initially. So to increase the number of DNA templates after the first extension is complete, the two DNA strands are dissociated by raising the temperature to the point where the DNA \u201cmelts.\u201d When the temperature is lowered, the next primer which is in high concentration in the reaction binds to the DNA template, and the process begins again. Using one primer, the process is rather slow and the increase in the DNA is linear. To make the process of amplification logarithmic, a second primer is added which binds downstream of the first primer on the complementary DNA template and any amplified DNAs which have the DNA template sequence. Therefore, after the first few cycles of primer binding (annealing), primer extension by the polymerase, and DNA melting, amplification of the original DNA template is rare in comparison with amplifications of primers binding and reamplifying newly synthesized DNA. The product of this reaction is a short segment of tens to thousands of base pairs of double-stranded DNA and, in acknowledgement of its synthetic origin, is known as an amplicon.",

Panels of primer sets have been published for nearly every pathogen including bioterrorism agents. Most of the gene targets for these panels use virulence factors as a condition of pathogenicity. For example, initial screening of forensic samples to find the source of a suspected Bacillus anthracis attack would likely include amplification and detection of genes for protective antigen (pag), lethal factor (lef) or edema factor (ef), and capsule (cap). All of these genes must be present for virulence [41]. Rapid testing of these targets and others such as BA 813, a chromosomal marker specific for the Bacillus cereus subspecies, can be accomplished on suspected spore preparations, i.e., white powders, without extensive sample cleanup. As shown in Figs. 2.2 and 2.3, amplification of BA 813 is evident when whole spores or vegetative cells are added directly to the PCR reaction without extraction or extensive methods to destroy the cell structure. As shown in Fig. 2.2, autoclaved spores which have been thermally disrupted and intact spores added to a PCR reaction amplify similarly. This method has been used for the toxin genes named above with similar results and sensitivities (Jackman, personal communication). This method works well because DNA is found on the external surface of spores. The exosporal DNA is intrinsically associated with the spore surface. Copious washing does not remove the DNA even when other DNAs added to the spore preparation are easily removed, suggesting that this DNA is tightly retained by the endospore during the sporulation by an as yet unknown mechanism. Our estimates based on enumeration of spore preparations and quantification of DNA target copy number indicate that about 1\u201310% of total genomic DNA is retained on the spore surface.\n\n",

Pure dry-powdered Bacillus anthracis spore preparations contain between 1012 and 1014 spores per gram depending on the sample preparation methods and amount of contaminants remaining. When adding vegetative bacteria directly to the PCR reaction, amplification is likely enhanced by the release of internal DNA by the process of heating and cooling in a typical PCR cycle. Heat shock is used to kill off by lysis vegetative cells in microbial preparations where only the number of spores (typically heat resistant). This property of vegetative cells can be easily exploited by the PCR process to liberate intracellular DNA targets for amplification.

Woese first recognized the uniqueness of rRNA as a tool for the classification of all life [43]. rRNA serves a structural and catalytic role in the production of proteins. The ribosome encodes the machinery for the translation of messenger RNA transcripts into their respective protein products. The presence of rRNA in cells is required for viability, and thus, the presence or absence of rRNA is sometimes used as a discriminator of live versus dead cells, respectively. There are three rRNA subunits located in a single gene transcriptional unit. In bacteria, the subunits identified originally by their sedimentation rate expressed in Svedberg unit(s) are 16S, 23S, and 5S. In eukaryotes, the subunits are 18S, 28S, 5.8S, and 5S.",

To do this, the microarray is placed on the microarray reader stage and gently heated. The loss of fluorescent signal is recorded over time for each of several hundred probes. As a result, hundreds of melting curves are generated, and the melting point (Tm) or point at which 50% of the fluorescence is lost indicates the exact sequence which is bound to each capture probe. Melting curves which show multiple humps indicate the presence of multiple Tm and hence multiple sequences bound to the same capture probe. By combining microarray hybridization with melting curve analysis of the bound targets, it is possible to discriminate mixtures of bacteria [60]. One disadvantage presently is the inability to discriminate between two bacteria from the same species but from different strains. In general, rRNA discriminates to the species level, although the addition of other genetic loci and their associated SNPs is easily accomplished using microarray technology. Thus, the microarrays could, with modification, be used to discriminate differences between strains.",

In the T5000 system (IBIS Inc), amplicons derived from samples using multiple primer sets are analyzed for both their presence and their mass which can be used to derive the sequence composition [61]. Unlike PCR approaches described above targeting specific gene sequences, the probes are designed not to be unique but to amplify sequences found in all microbes; hence, primers amplify not only the rRNA genes but also housekeeping genes such as tRNA synthetase, topoisomerase, polymerases, and other genes common among organisms. Following amplification, the products are fed into an electrospray ionization mass spectrometer, and the molecular masses of each strand of each amplified product are determined within 1 Da of its mass to obtain a precise base composition. The resulting profile of all the gene products and accurate masses are matched to a database for triangulation of the most likely organism. Since the smallest difference in molecular weight possible for a single base substitution as occurs within a SNP is greater than a Dalton, the T5000 system can detect single base differences and can be used to distinguish strains. This system also uses an automated hierarchical strategy to order the information derived from the various amplicons and their masses to identify microbes with high confidence [62]. One of the great advantages of this system is that it can successfully identify mixtures of pathogens.",

Pattern analysis of whole genomes started and still uses RFLP and AFLP analyses as screening tools for evaluation of mixed strains in a population [63\u201365]. RFLP as described above uses random pattern analysis created by restriction enzyme digestion of the genome and separation of fragments.

One of the drawbacks of these approaches is that the patterns are a global representation of the genomic patterns. As a result, it is difficult to predict the stability of the observed pattern or to compare across genomes due to the large differences in frequency of restriction sites for any one restriction enzyme in all microbes and the relatively low characterization of mutation rates in restriction enzyme sites for many organisms.",

The best use and most advanced development of VNTRs for forensic and legal use is based on markers for human DNA. In humans, the most useful VNTRs are repeats of 2\u20137 base pairs found in microsatellite DNA known as short tandem repeats (STRs) [66]. Despite the large amount of research on STRs, the functions of STRs are as yet unknown; however, the original supposition that STRs are only \u201cjunk DNA\u201d is being gradually replaced with functional assignments for specific STRs. There are over 10,000 STRs in the human genome, but only 13 human STRs have been down-selected for use in forensics due to their high degree of variation and large amount of available data. STRs are heritable and can be used to determine relatedness. Using a combination of sequencing probes, automated sequencing, and well-validated algorithms, information derived from human sequences has been placed in a global DNA database known as the Combined DNA Index System (CODIS). Due to the number of variants for each of the 13 loci, the chance that two people share all 13 loci variants is 5  \u00d7  1019, therefore making this matching tool one of the most robust personal identification systems in the world.",

Though their genomes are smaller, by comparison to humans, the number of microbial species is staggering, and therefore, the potential number of multi-VTNR for typing all species of bacteria is even larger. As a result, not all bacteria can be readily typed by this method. MLVA analysis is heavily dependent upon a rich database of sequences for a particular bacterial species or subspecies [70].

Based from the human SNP efforts, for a mutation to be designated as a SNP, the polymorphism (rather than a random or common mutation) must occur in greater than 1% of the population (SNP consortium, [79]). Thus, translation of this description to microbial populations is somewhat more difficult. Is the population of bacteria defined as a mixture of strains, colonies on a plate, or individuals in a culture tube? Classifying true polymorphisms from mutations requires the simultaneous development of statistical tools to track the stability of polymorphisms in a collection of strains [80]. One of the best examples to illustrate this development occurs in a series of papers published over 5 years, describing the search for SNPs in the Bacillus anthracis genome [81]. Prior to these studies, Bacillus anthracis was considered to have a relatively monogenetic type. Its low rate of spontaneous mutation supported that conclusion. However, once the genome was assembled, it was clear that Bacillus anthracis could be differentiated at the strain and isolate level based on the analysis of approximately 60 SNPs. Further work with complete and redundant sequences led to the discovery of over 3,500 SNPs in the plasmid and chromosomal Bacillus anthracis genome [82]. In an effort to make microbial typing easier using comparative genomics based on SNPs, sequencing primers specific to 32 of the chromosomal SNPs which showed the best discrimination among isolates were down-selected and used in subsequent restricted sequencing approaches to highlight these polymorphisms by strain [83].",

            "text": "Still it is important to note that SNP analysis of whole genomes is of greatest utility when the overall mutation rate is low. Both laboratory and environmental effects have been documented which induce the evolution of the mutator phenotype in some bacteria in a population [84]. Culture stress, exposure to antibiotics in the host, and coexistence with other viral pathogens have all been demonstrated to induce the mutator phenotype [85, 86]. Mutator bacteria have significantly higher rates of spontaneous mutation than other members of their community. Deletions or alterations in the genes associated with polymerase function have been demonstrated to induce mutator types in Bacillus anthracis [87]. The phenotype is induced presumably by enhanced adaptation under environmentally stressful conditions and by providing the most diverse genetic background for survival selection by speeding adaptation under environmentally stressful conditions and providing a more diverse genetic background. All DNA-containing microbes including viruses have the same rates of spontaneous mutation [24]. As a precautionary step or to aid the interpretation of SNP data sets, general screening methods such as monitoring for rifampicin resistance might be beneficial prior to whole genome analysis especially when extensive culture on highly restrictive media, suboptimal storage, or environmental stressors may act as the foundation for induction of this phenotype [86]. This is particularly true for host-derived materials relative to long-established laboratory adapted strains. Observed elevations in mutations in culture material should be taken as a warning sign that cultures contain mutator phenotypes and relative SNP between strains should be surveyed for artifacts. A caveat in the use of SNPs for forensic analysis is that the mutation rate should be relatively low or the stability of an individual SNP be known in order for it to be useful for establishing strain or isolate identities.",

While a variety of methods are possible, mass spectrometry is a technology which is central to all these applications. The most commonly used systems are Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization Time of Flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF), Electrospray Ionization Time of Flight mass spectrometry (ESI-TOF), and Gas Chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) [88\u201391]. Two of these technologies, MALDI-TOF and ESI-TOF, are commonly used to detect and identify proteins using sequence-related information, which can sometimes be crucial to identification of microbes or understanding differences observed in microbes from the same lineage.",

The rule of one gene\u2013one transcript\u2013one protein is frequently ignored in the microbial world [92]. Posttranscriptional modification of RNA called RNA editing has been well documented [93]. Viruses and bacteria can very specifically alter a nucleotide in transcribed RNA resulting in a change in the translation if a coding sequence resulting in the incorporation of a different amino acid from that represented in the coding sequence. Other mechanisms used include genomic stuttering and insertion of sequences at the level of the RNA. As a result, direct protein profiling is essential for determination and identification of proteins and variants thereof.

Since natural infections of high-consequence microbial pathogens occur worldwide, it is important to be able to distinguish the origination of materials. This information can be used to determine attribution. Particularly important to the concept of attribution is the addition of specific materials to the microbial preparation intended to enhance microbial virulence or to promote microbial survival. These materials include flow factors added to aerosolized preparation to improve distribution of the target microbe and encapsulants which can be used to stabilize microbes [94, 95]. The purpose of these types of stabilizers is to promote the survival of the microbe in harsh environments or to act as a trigger for microorganism growth until the correct environment (pH, temperature, pressure, etc.) is reached. A thorough discussion of this concept is beyond the scope of this chapter but is addressed by Wahl (10.1007/978-1-60327-219-3_8, this volume).",

While the genetic profiling methods will have a remarkable impact on the ability to rapidly identify an unknown pathogen, speciate microbes, and discriminate isolates, other techniques should be applied in order to capture information for attribution which is not located in the genome. In the postgenomic age, tools such as mass spectrometry hold promise for general application to the area of attribution by providing information regarding contaminants, coassociating viruses, media, or host residues and other hitchhiking factors. The highest confidence approaches will employ a variety of orthogonal and parallel processes in order to gain the greatest argument in support of an attribution source.",
