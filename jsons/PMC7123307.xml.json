            "text": "The drug lymphocyte stimulation test (DLST) is sometimes helpful in the diagnosis of a DLI. 3H-thymidine uptake by lymphocytes is measured as a stimulating index. The DLST has a positivity rate of 66.9% in patients with drug-induced pneumonia [4, 5]. The rate of drug-induced pneumonia due to herbal medication is 67.6% [5]. However, the results of the DLST should be interpreted with caution for several reasons. First, the DLST is performed in vitro; therefore, the results may be inconsistent with the in vivo condition. Second, the administration procedure is not well established; therefore, the results of the DLST can be different at different institutions. Third, false-positive or false-negative reactions often occur when the DLST is used as a diagnostic test for a DLI, regardless of whether herbal medication is involved. Moreover, herbal medicine includes several plant components (Table 13.2). Some of these components cannot be absorbed in the intestine. A DLST test is performed in vitro; therefore, the component that is not present in the blood in vivo can react with the lymphocytes in vitro (i.e., a false-positive result). For example, Sho-Saiko-To (SST) can directly stimulate lymphocytes, thereby resulting in a false-positive result [4, 6]. Nakayama reported that a DLST for SST was positive in 27.5% of healthy controls [6]. Therefore, we need to carefully consider the result of a DLST in patients suspected with a DLI due to herbal medication.\n",
