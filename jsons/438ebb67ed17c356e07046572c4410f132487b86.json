To investigate its spreading mechanism, genomes of the coronavirus were compared to those of the influenza 40 virus (3) by principal component analysis (PCA) (4) . These two RNA viruses differed in host specificity and speed of mutations. Here, I present the characteristics of both and the changes in coronavirus. The coronaviruses presented smaller variations and did not differ much from host to host. These characteristics may have eased the novel transfection of coronaviruses to humans; 45 many of the bat strains seem to have the ability to infect humans, and the intermediate animals may not be necessarily required, against the present expectations. Although many of the coronaviruses were more conservative, their character may reflect a less selective pressure owing to their limited infectivity.",

Both directly replicate using their 55 RNA-dependent RNA polymerases, which may cause many errors (5). This characteristic has introduced variations among coronaviruses, including the number and size of their open reading frames (ORFs). Some classes of coronaviruses, such as HCoV, cause upper respiratory tract infections in humans. The symptoms are mostly similar to those of the common 60 cold, but they may also cause severe pneumonia (6) . They have lower infectivity than the human influenza viruses. For example, a 2010-2015 study in China reported that 2.3% and 30% of patients were positive for coronavirus and influenza virus, respectively (6); a similar ratio was found in another large study (6) . Some viruses may have a much higher infectivity and cause outbreaks: e.g., 65 SARS-CoV (7, 8) , MERS-CoV (7, 9, 10) , and SARS-CoV-2 (SCoV2) (2, (11) (12) (13) .",

Although host-virus specificities are shown in laboratory experiments (19), as both humans and other animals have individual variations, the barrier would be more fragile in reality. Once an infection occurs, the virus will adapt through mutations, as for the SARS virus (18). Long-term 255 accumulation of mutations in intermediate hosts, such as swine for influenza viruses, is not essential. These viruses would have a limited infectious character and cause mild symptoms to bats or other hosts; however, they could show an excessive adaptation to humans as SARS-and MERS-CoV did. As humans do not have herd immunity to many classes of coronaviruses (they do not contain 260 HCoV), these might produce a new pandemic. If intermediates are required, its main contribution could be the amplification of the inoculum size and contact frequency. Bats and human habitats are different, and a bat may not egest enough viruses to infect different hosts. The size of the donor animal is important, e.g. healthcare workers with secondary MERS 265",
