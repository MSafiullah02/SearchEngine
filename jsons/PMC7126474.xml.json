It has become clear that mRNAs contain secondary and tertiary structures both in the coding and non-coding regions and that these interactions are critical to regulation of translation in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic systems. mRNA structures can regulate translation during initiation, elongation, and termination or by affecting the rate of mRNA degradation. Regulation of translation initiation has been observed when proteins interact with 5\u2032 untranslated region (UTR) mRNA structures: for example, a hairpin in the case of the iron-responsive element (IRE) on the ferritin mRNA and an RNA pseudoknot in the case of the Escherichia coli\u03b1 operon (Tang & Draper, 1990). Hairpins and pseudoknots have also been implicated in ribosomal frameshifting and hopping during elongation, stop codon readthrough at termination and regulation of mRNA degradation (for a review, seeGesteland & Atkins, 1996).",

Frameshifting can occur in either direction to the \u22121, \u22122, or +1 frames Matsufuji et al 1996, Farabaugh 1996. The \u22121 ribosomal frameshifting is a common mechanism used by RNA viruses to regulate the synthesis level of certain proteins and to ensure packaging of pol and pro gene products by expressing them as fusion proteins with the gag gene capsid protein. The frequency at which frameshifting occurs is variable, from 1-5 % in some plant viruses up to 50 % in the dnaX frameshift site of E. coli\n(Larsen et al., 1997) with typical retroviral efficiencies between 15 and 30 % Brierley 1995. The \u22121 ribosomal frameshift site is typically composed of a heptameric nucleotide sequence X XXY YYZ in the zero coding frame. The identities of the nucleotides vary in different sites and between prokaryotes and eukaryotes. The primary sequence requirement appears to be that at least two of the three mRNA codon-tRNA anticodon base-pairing interactions can be maintained in the new frame (XXX YYY Z).",

In this model, both the A and P sites of the ribosome contain tRNAs and the frameshift occurs when both the A and P-site tRNAs slip into the \u22121 frame on the slip site heptamer. Sites with high frameshifting efficiencies typically have mRNA structures required for maintaining high efficiency located three to nine nucleotides downstream of the slippery heptamer. In many, though not all cases, the structural element downstream of the slippery site is proposed to form an H-type RNA pseudoknot. One explanation is that these RNA structures simply slow or stall the ribosome temporarily, increasing the amount of time the ribosome spends on the slippery sequence, and thereby increasing the probability of a frameshifting event.",

In ScV, ribosomal pausing was assayed using \u201cheelprinting\u201d to locate regions of the mRNA protected from nuclease digestion in the presence of translating ribosomes. Ribosomal pausing was monitored at the IBV frameshift site by examining the size and distribution of incomplete polypeptide intermediates generated from initiation-synchronized in vitro translation over time. Pausing was shown to correlate well with frameshift efficiency but both studies observed structures with normal pausing but no detectable frameshifting. This suggests that ribosomal pausing is necessary, but not sufficient, for frameshifting. In addition, thermodynamic stability of the RNA structure alone apparently cannot account for frameshifting efficiency at the ScV and IBV frameshift sites, although this point has not been thoroughly investigated.",

            "text": "Structurally, the most well-characterized frameshifting pseudoknot occurs at the gag-pro frameshift site in mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV). This pseudoknot has been subjected to mutational analysis and structure probing Chamorro et al 1992, Chen et al 1995 and the solution structure has been solved by NMR (Shen & Tinoco, 1995). In addition, the structures of frameshifting and non-frameshifting variants have also been determined Chen et al 1996, Kang et al 1996, Kang and Tinoco 1997. Frameshifting efficiency in these MMTV pseudoknot derivatives was found to correlate with a specifically bent conformation, where the two helical stems were prevented from coaxially stacking by a single unpaired adenosine at the helical junction. An extensive mutational study was also performed on the pseudoknot at the gag-pro frameshift site in simian retrovirus 1 (SRV-1) (ten Dam et al., 1995). The frameshifting efficiency of base-pair substitutions in the second stem of the pseudoknot correlated qualitatively with the predicted thermodynamic stability of that stem. NMR evidence suggests that the closing A-U base-pair in stem 2 at the helical junction is formed (Du et al., 1997) while mutational analysis suggests that the identity of the two nucleotides and their ability to base-pair have no affect on frameshifting efficiency Chen et al 1996, Sung and Kang 1998, prompting these authors to hypothesize that the SRV-1 pseudoknot is also bent, like in MMTV.",

Initially, melts were collected on a wild-type mIAP pseudoknot and mIAP-HP with a short single-stranded 5\u2032 tail. The 5\u2032 single-stranded tail was omitted from the mIAP wild-type pseudoknot RNA and subsequent mutant RNAs when it was observed that it did not significantly affect the stability of the pseudoknot as determined from optical melting profiles (data not shown).",

The profile exhibits hyperchromicity in two transitions, a broad low intensity transition between 30 and 50 \u00b0C and a sharper, higher intensity transition above 80 \u00b0C, both with significant hyperchromicity at 280 nm as expected for the high G-C content of the two helical stems (Fresco et al., 1963). Even though initial inspection gives the appearance of only two transitions, it was necessary to fit the data to four sequential two-state transitions in order to eliminate the periodic deviation in the residuals observed when fitting to fewer transitions. Turner rules compiled at 1 M NaCl predict an enthalpy of 68 and 77 kcal mol\u22121 for the melting of stems 1 and 2, respectively, provided seven base-pairs are formed in stem 2 and the 3\u2032 single-stranded nucleotide stacks against the stem Turner et al 1988, He et al 1991, Xia et al 1998. The predicted stabilization due to stacked Watson-Crick base-pairs was calculated using the modified individual nearest-neighbor model (INN-HB) parameters which account for the difference in stabilization between internal and closing A-U base-pairs (Xia et al., 1998). The thermodynamic parameters for hairpin and bulge loops reported byTurner et al. (1988) were used. In good agreement with these predictions, the first two transitions have a combined \u0394H=75 kcal mol\u22121 and the final transition has an \u0394H=66.7 kcal mol\u22121, suggesting that stem 2 unfolds first in two steps with stem 1 unfolding at much higher temperature.",

Unexpectedly, the optical melting profile of the mIAP-HP shows three distinct transitions. The first transition is unusual in that it has significant hyperchromicity (\u2202A/\u2202T) only at 260 nm with a very high enthalpy (\u0394H=76 kcal mol\u22121) at t\nm =47 \u00b0C. The second transition has an \u0394H=42 kcal mol\u22121 and an (\u2202A\n260/\u2202T)/(\u2202A\n280/\u2202T) value (A\n260/A\n280 ratio) of \u22480.26, while the third transition is characterized by \u0394H=57 kcal mol\u22121 and A\n260/A\n280 \u22480.36. The melting profile was superimposable in both the folding and unfolding directions (data not shown). The combined enthalpy of these transitions is 175 kcal mol\u22121, much larger than would be predicted from the nearest-neighbor model for the stem 1 hairpin (64 kcal mol\u22121). The molecular origin of the first unfolding transition is unknown; however, it is observed calorimetrically as well with essentially identical van\u2019t Hoff thermodynamic parameters (data not shown). The second transition shows a concentration dependence over the 2-55 \u03bcM range consistent with predictions for formation of some kind of intermolecular structure. The high enthalpy and t\nm and low A\n260/A\n280 ratio of the third optical transition are consistent with predictions for the unfolding of a stem consisting of six G-C base-pairs.",

The first unfolding transition at 63 \u00b0C is assigned to unfolding of stem 2. Comparing the wild-type mIAP and \u0394A35 RNAs, the transitions observed at lower t\nm differ significantly in hyperchromic intensity. However, the first \u0394A35 RNA transition and the combined first and second mIAP RNA transitions return the same total calorimetric enthalpy as determined by the area under the curve. The calorimetric enthalpy observed for these two molecules confirms that stem 2 unfolding in the wild-type mIAP pseudoknot occurs in two tightly coupled transitions with base stacking interactions similar to that observed in the \u0394A35 RNA. More importantly, the van\u2019t Hoff. Enthalpics determined for each transition from calorimetry and from optical melts are in excellent agreement with one another and, whem summed, agree well with the osberved total calorimetric enthalpy.

Under these conditions, all of the RNA molecules studied here appear fully folded, since the total recovered unfolding enthalpy is comparable to nearest-neighbor predictions and does not change greatly with added Mg2+\n(Table 2). To further probe the stabilization of the wild-type mIAP pseudoknot by Mg2+, optical melts were collected over a wide range of Mg2+ concentrations (50 \u03bcM-50 mM) in this background of 50 mM KCl. The data are shown in Figure 6\nfor the F\u2192S1+J and S1+J\u2192I transitions in the format of a 1/t\nm\nversus log[Mg2+] plot. Given the non-linear dependence of 1/t\nm on log[Mg2+] for these two unfolding transitions, the data were fit to a non-specific binding model for divalent ions in which the folded and unfolded forms of the RNA participating in the transition have non-negligible affinities for Mg2+\nLaing et al 1994, Nixon and Giedroc 1998, Gluick et al 1997. The number of phosphate groups participating in these two unfolding steps was fixed at 8 and 6, respectively. The magnesium binding affinities for the folded (K\nf) and unfolded (K\nu) forms were found to be 3500(\u00b1200) M\u22121 and 500(\u00b140) M\u22121, respectively, for the first transition and 3500(\u00b1600) M\u22121 and 700(\u00b1150) M\u22121 for the second transition. The non-specific model fits the data extremely well with a total of \u22482.3 Mg2+ released upon unfolding of the pseudoknot to the partially folded stem 1 hairpin intermediate at 0.4 mM Mg2+. For comparison, the unfolding of a seven base-pair hairpin releases \u22481 Mg2+ at slightly higher monovalent salt (0.10 M K+), suggesting that the fully and partially folded pseudoknot sequesters slightly more Mg2+ than do similarly sized RNA hairpins (Nixon et al., 1999).",

Urea was used to decrease the t\nm of the transitions in a pseudoknot involved in stop-codon readthrough at the gag-pol junction in the Moloney murine leukemia virus mRNA (MuLV) (Gluick et al., 1997). In that study, a linear and shallow dependence of the t\nm on the urea concentration was observed, while the van\u2019t Hoff enthalpies were found to decrease by only a small extent. When the wild-type and \u0394A15 pseudoknots were thermally denatured in the presence of increasing concentrations of urea, significant differences in their melting profiles were observed as shown in Figure 8. In the wild-type pseudoknot, the two low temperature transitions remain tightly coupled and appear to move together to lower t\nm, although urea-induced destabilization of stem 2 is considerably more pronounced than that of stem 1. In the \u0394A15 RNA, both stem 2 unfolding transitions move to lower t\nm at low urea concentrations; at greater than 20 % (w/v) urea, the first transition continues to move to lower t\nm, while the second transition appears to stop, allowing clear separation of the two stem 2 transitions on the temperature coordinate. Although the molecular origins of these effects of urea are unknown, these data provide additional evidence that the helical junction regions of these two pseudoknots may well be different, with the \u0394A15 deletion modestly destabilizing at low urea and ultimately stabilizing in high urea.",

The optical and calorimetric profiles for L2U are shown compared to the wild-type pseudoknot in Figure 9\nwith the thermodynamic data compiled in Table 2, Table 3. This substitution has a dramatic impact on the appearance of the melting profile of the molecule. Analysis of the optical melting profile shows that the F\u2192S1+J transition is significantly destabilized with the van\u2019t Hoff enthalpy and t\nm decreased by 17 kcal mol\u22121 and 15 deg.

The calorimetric data show trends that mirror the optical data and emphasize the strong, largely entropically derived destabilization of the 3\u2032 substem of stem 2 (compare Figure 3, Figure 9). This is the only mutant RNA for which the F\u2192S1+J and S1+J\u2192I unfolding steps are not tightly coupled on the temperature coordinate at 0 mM Mg2+.

This is followed by the unfolding of the remainder of the helical stem 2 to form an intermediate (I) which consists of the stem 1 hairpin with some as yet unknown structure in the hairpin loop.

This general unfolding behavior was also observed for the gene 32 autoregulatory H-type pseudoknot from bacteriophage T2 (Nixon & Giedroc, 1998) in which the 3\u2032 helical stem, predicted to be more stable thermodynamically, unfolds first in two discernable transitions, followed by the 5\u2032 helical stem.

Tertiary structure in RNA is folded after and unfolded before secondary structure (Draper, 1996). If Mg2+ induces tertiary structure in the pseudoknot, the unfolding of the tertiary structure would be expected to occur before, or concomitant with, the unfolding of the secondary structure. The van\u2019t Hoff enthalpy observed for the two stem 2 transitions in the wild-type mIAP does not increase with increasing [Mg2+]\u2a7e1.0 mM and no new unfolding transitions are observed, suggesting that Mg2+ does not induce the additional folding or energetically significant loop-stem interactions found in more complex RNAs (Draper, 1996). Thermodynamic analysis of the unfolding of other simple H-type RNA pseudoknots suggests that this may be a general property of these molecules Gluick et al 1997, Nixon and Giedroc 1998, Theimer et al 1998. Consistent with this, the studies reported here suggest that the unfolding of these RNAs does not seem to be accompanied by a large change in the total heat capacity of the system, given the excellent agreement between the van\u2019t Hoff enthalpies determined from optical and calorimetric experiments (Table 2).",

The mIAP pseudoknot shares some similarities with the SRV-1 and MMTV pseudoknots including structural ambiguity at the junction of the two helical stems. Deletion of the junction adenosine base in the mIAP pseudoknot, A15, is only slightly destabilizing with \u0394\u0394G\u00b0(37 \u00b0C)\u22481 kcal mol\u22121. This destabilization is smaller than would be predicted for the loss of an A-U base-pair and coaxial stacking on stem 1. The close approach of backbone phosphate groups at the helical junction in RNA pseudoknots sometimes creates a region high in negative electrostatic potential which has been suggested as a possible location for chelation of divalent metal ions with higher affinity than duplex RNA Gluick et al 1997, Puglisi et al 1990, Nixon and Giedroc 1998. Therefore, mutations at the helical junction might destabilize an RNA pseudoknot by significantly altering higher affinity divalent binding sites. The wild-type mIAP and \u0394A15 pseudoknots were studied over a wide range of Mg2+ concentrations (50 \u03bcM-50 mM), and the dependence of t\nm on [Mg2+] for the F\u2192S1+J and S1+J\u2192I transitions fit to a non-specific binding model for divalent ions (Figure 6). The magnitude of K\nf andK\nu, which represent the average affinities of the RNAs for Mg2+, were found to be reasonable for non-specific binding in a background of 50 mM KCl compared to the magnitudes of K\nf and K\nu values determined for the pseudoknot from bacteriophage T2 gene32 mRNA at 100 mM KCl Nixon and Giedroc 1998, Nixon et al 1999. More importantly, the Mg2+ binding affinities were found to be virtually identical for these two RNAs, suggesting that it is unlikely that the A15 deletion causes the loss of a specific ion binding site or results in differential accumulation of ions in the pseudoknot. The uncoupling of the two stem 2 transitions in the \u0394A15 molecule in the presence of urea (Figure 8), with the region of stem 2 closest to the junction becoming stabilized toward urea denaturation compared to the mIAP pseudoknot, however, suggests that the helical junction in the F and S1+J conformations of the \u0394A15 pseudoknot may be better stacked than in the wild-type mIAP pseudoknot.",

In combination with the small destabilization observed upon deletion of A15, these data suggest that A15 is unpaired or not strongly paired. Structure probing experiments indicate that the unpaired adenosine base in stem 2, A35, and the adenosine bases in loop 2 are substantially more susceptible to DEPC modification than is A15 in the wild-type mIAP pseudoknot (T. Young & C.A.T., unpublished results). The reduced susceptibility of A15 to both chemical modification and enzymatic cleavage may suggest that some or all of the A15 nucleotide is not totally exposed to solvent; additional structural insight will have to await further structural studies. Analogous thermodynamic studies of the structurally characterized MMTV-vpk pseudoknot (Shen & Tinoco, 1995) suggest that the unpaired adenosine base at the junction does not contribute exceptional stability to the pseudoknot and in fact provides stabilization equivalent to that predicted for a 3\u2032 single-stranded nucleotide stacked on the junction base-pair of stem 2 (unpublished results).",

Deletion of A35 is predicted to be stabilizing, allowing the formation of an uninterrupted stem 2, which would unfold in a single cooperative transition. A15 and A35 were both deleted in the \u0394A35A15 RNA, to determine if the A15 deletion, which is only modestly destabilizing in the context of the wild-type pseudoknot, has the same effect in the context of a continuous stem 2. The calculated and predicted thermodynamic parameters for the \u0394A35 and \u0394A35A15 RNAs are summarized in Table 3. The \u0394A35 RNA stabilizes the mIAP pseudoknot by 3.2 kcal mol\u22121, exactly as expected for the elimination of the entropic destabilization predicted for a single nucleotide bulge in a helical stem (Turner et al., 1988). Although the molecular origin may well be different, deletion of A15 in the context of the \u0394A35 deletion reveals that the free energy of unfolding of stem 2 is also \u22481 kcal mol\u22121 smaller than \u0394A35 RNA, coupled with a small perturbation in the stability of stem 1. These results suggest that the thermodynamic impact of these two deletions are very nearly additive, suggesting that it is unlikely that the unpaired adenosine bases cooperate in some way to globally stabilize the molecule.",

            "text": "In pseudoknots that promote frameshifting and stop codon readthrough, the sequence and length of loop 2 has been shown in some cases to be functionally significant. For example, sequences in loop 2 seem to be important for stop codon readthrough at the UAG terminator between gag and pol in Moloney murine leukemia virus (MuLV) Wills et al 1991, Wills et al 1994. On the other hand, the entire loop 2 sequence in the gag-pro frameshift site in SRV-1 can be changed with essentially no effect on frameshifting, and reducing the length of loop 2 actually increases frameshifting activity (ten Dam et al., 1995). The effect of loop 2 sequence and length on the stability of the pseudoknot cannot be predicted from known thermodynamic parameters although the minimum loop length requirements have been experimentally examined Pleij et al 1985, Wyatt et al 1990. The substitution of the loop 2 sequence with uridine bases in the mIAP pseudoknot uncouples the F\u2192S1+J and S1+J\u2192I unfolding events, destabilizing the 3\u2032 substem and stabilizing the junction substem. The combined enthalpy of the first two stem 2 transitions is close to that predicted for the entire helical stem, and the overall destabilization compared to the mIAP pseudoknot \u0394\u0394G\u00b0 (37 \u00b0C) is 1.2 kcal mol\u22121 from optical melts and 3.0 kcal mol\u22121 determined calorimetrically. Interestingly, the L2U mutant melting profile bears a striking resemblance to the effect of 20-25 % urea on the melting profile of the \u0394A15 RNA pseudoknot (Figure 8). This suggests that the origin of this perturbation of the stability of the molecule by uridine substitution of loop 2 may be similar to that induced by low concentrations of urea. The mechanism by which urea destabilizes RNA is not known, but hydrogen bonding to RNA functional groups or a change in solvent ordering are two possibilities. In any case, both effects are likely transmitted through a selectively weakened junction region. These findings suggest that caution must be exercised in ascribing changes in frameshifting efficiency to nucleotide sequence effects, due to the possibility of a change in the global stability of the molecule.",
