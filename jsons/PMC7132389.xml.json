            "text": "Neonatal calf diarrhoea (NCD) is one of the major health challenges in both beef and dairy cattle herds (De la Fuente et al., 1999, USDA, 2010). The prevalence and incidence risk for NCD has recently been reported to be 19.1 and 21.2%, respectively (Bartels et al., 2010, Windeyer et al., 2014). In the USA, diarrhoea in neonatal calves accounts for more than 50% of unweaned dairy heifer deaths (USDA, 2010). Economic losses are also due to reduced growth rates, treatment costs and time spent caring for the affected calves (Anderson et al., 2003, Ok et al., 2009). Moreover, NCD creates a problem in terms of animal welfare and farmer distress (Lorenz et al., 2011, Smith, 2012). The herd veterinarian is the most adequate person to advice farmers how to treat and how to prevent NCD (Smith, 2012).",

Rotavirus and C. parvum are most frequently identified in faecal samples from calves with NCD: prevalence in calves with diarrhoea ranges from 2.6 to 45.1%, 17.7 to 79.9%, 3.1 to 21.6% and 27.8 to 58.5%, for E. coli, rota- and coronavirus and C. parvum, respectively (Geurden et al., 2008, Ok et al., 2009, Bartels et al., 2010, Izzo et al., 2011).

To evaluate the variance occurring at the herd level, null models were fit with herd as random effect for all dependent variables.(1)Risk factor analysis. To identify herd level risk factors associated with the likelihood of diarrhoea within the first 14 days after birth, a logistic regression model was fit (Table 2\n). Initially, univariable associations were tested between the binary dependent variable \u2018occurrence of diarrhoea\u2019 at the calf level (0 = no; 1 = yes) and all categorical independent variables at the herd level presented in Table 1. Statistical significance in this step was assessed at P\n < 0.20. Secondly, Spearman correlation coefficients were calculated among the significant independent variables to check for multicollinearity. If two independent variables had a correlation coefficient \u22650.6, only one was selected for further analysis. Contact between weaned and non-weaned calves and cleaning and disinfecting of the calf box after each calf were correlated, as were milk type and temperature control of milk given. Cleaning and disinfecting of the calf box after each calf and type of milk were selected because these are the biologically most relevant factors. In the third step, a multivariable model was fit using a stepwise backward procedure. A variable was considered to act as a confounder if its removal made the regression coefficients of the remaining variables undergo a relative change >25% or in case the regression coefficient ranged between \u22120.4 and 0.4, if an absolute change >0.1 was observed (Noordhuizen et al., 2001). Statistical significance in this step was assessed at P\n < 0.05.(2)Protocol efficacy. First, to determine the association between the treatment groups (control or treatment) and the likelihood of diarrhoea within the first 14 days after birth at the calf level and mortality within the first 14 days after birth while having diarrhoea at the calf level, respectively, logistic mixed regression models with herd as random effect were fit (Table 2). The association between groups (control or treated) and the duration of diarrhoea at the calf level was determined using survival analysis. Calves that died while having diarrhoea were censored. A survival model was fit with herd as shared frailty effect to correct for clustering of calves within herds, and group as categorical fixed effect (Table 2).Secondly, separate logistic mixed regression models were fit (Table 2) to test the association between the binary dependent variables shedding of E. coli (0 = no and 1 = yes), shedding of rotavirus (0 = no and 1 = yes), shedding of coronavirus (0 = no and 1 = yes), and shedding of C. parvum (0 = no and 1 = yes) at the observation level, and group (control or treated), time of sampling (0 = before the onset of the study; 1 = at the end of the study) and the interaction term between group and time of sampling as categorical independent variables.(3)Evaluation of the colostrum management. Logistic mixed regression models were fit to determine (a) the association between the amount of IgG given to a calf within the first 6 and 12 h after birth (0: IgG < 200 g and 1: IgG \u2265 200) as independent variable and the likelihood of diarrhoea within the first 14 days after birth as dependent variable, (b) the association between colostral quality (0: <50 g IgG/l and 1: \u226550 g IgG/l) as independent variable and the likelihood of diarrhoea as dependent variable, and (c) the association between the group (control or treated) as independent variable and the amount of IgG given to a calf (0: IgG < 200 g and 1: IgG \u2265 200) within the first 6 and 12 h after birth as dependent variable.\n",

As the tetrakit used to determine pathogen excretion is not a quantitative but rather a qualitative to semi-quantitative test, the exact level of pathogen excretion per calf could not be assessed. Hence, we may state that fewer calves excreted enteropathogens following the implementation of the 2 step protocol, but not whether individual excretion was lowered.

            "text": "The overall passive immunity for both treated and control herds was adequate, as indicated by the average IgG serum content which also did not differ significantly between groups. Several other authors reported lower average IgG values ranging from 12 to 19 g/L and FPT10 percentages up to 50% (Tyler et al., 1996; Calloway et al., 2002, Filteau et al., 2003). McGuirk and Collins (2004) set the alarm level for FPT10 to be a herd problem at 20%, whilst Chigerwe et al. (2009) consider an FPT prevalence <10% as a rational and achievable goal. Despite the adequate passive immunity in this study, several calves developed diarrhoea which may suggest that the cut off value of 10 g IgG/L is too low, and should be revised (G\u00fcng\u00f6r et al., 2004, Chigerwe et al., 2008, Windeyer et al., 2014). Also, the association between the level of passive immunity and the occurrence of NCD is less clear in comparison to the occurrence of respiratory disease (Donovan et al., 1998).",
