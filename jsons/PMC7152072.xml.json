For example, because bats are an ancient vertebrate taxon that has co-evolved with a diversity of endemic viruses, are highly communal in their biology and behavior, and may migrate long distances, they have proven to be a frequent source of new zoonotic pathogens for people.5 Nonhuman primates, due to their genetic relatedness to people, have been the source for global pandemic infections like HIV/AIDS and persistent outbreaks of sylvatic yellow fever.6, 7 Direct and indirect contact with rodents, which commonly commingle with people in dwellings worldwide, have also resulted in the emergence of hantavirus and the geographical spread of Chagas Disease (see Chapter 35).8, 9\n",

These behaviors and activities bring people into close contact with wildlife. As a result, pandemic EIDs such as Ebola virus disease have emerged, particularly in areas of high biodiversity (see Chapter 34).10, 11 Nipah virus, for example, was first reported in Malaysia in 1999, causing pneumonia in domestic swine and encephalitis in swine farmers (see Chapter 40).12 Once the previously unknown paramyxovirus was isolated from patients, the source of the virus was traced back to Pteropid fruit bats that were roosting in trees in swine facilities that had been constructed in newly deforested habitats. Similarly, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) emerged in November 2002 in southern China, causing flu-like illness in people and causing mortality in 10% of cases.13 By July 2003, SARS had been detected in 37 countries. A novel coronavirus was isolated from patients and also detected in wild palm civets (Paradoxurus hermaphroditus) being sold live in markets for human consumption. This unfortunately triggered large-scale extermination of civets in a misguided attempt to curb the outbreak, as it was later determined that SARS-like coronaviruses (Co-V) were endemic in wild bats, with civets and humans as spillover hosts.14\n",

The EPT program was designed to be proactive and preemptive in its approach to wildlife zoonoses: to increase our understanding of the ecologic, viral, and behavioral drivers of wildlife virus spillover; train people in biodiversity hotspots around the world to detect and control zoonoses and disease emergence; and build capacity among government ministries for outbreak response and mitigation.15\n",

Led by the University of California, Davis, One Health Institute (in the School of Veterinary Medicine), PREDICT was initially implemented in 20 countries in Africa, South and Southeast Asia, and Latin America by a consortium of organizations including EcoHealth Alliance, Metabiota, the Smithsonian Institution, and the Wildlife Conservation Society (Fig. 19.2\n). PREDICT's objectives were to: (1) conduct wildlife surveillance and virus discovery in EID \u201chotspots\u201d characterized by high wildlife diversity and increasing human pressure on natural resources; (2) characterize high-risk human-animal interfaces, behaviors, and drivers of pathogen spillover from wildlife to people; (3) improve virus detection and discovery by developing laboratory and disease outbreak response capacities; (4) optimize predictive models for zoonotic disease emergence and spread; and (5) deploy cutting-edge information management and communication tools to advance a more integrated, global approach to sharing data from zoonotic virus surveillance. As well, the PREDICT Consortium was wholly committed to limiting potential harm to wildlife populations by implementing live-capture protocols only and by expressing a conservation ethic in all activities, especially communications with stakeholders. For example, when discussing bats as hosts of potential zoonoses, PREDICT teams always coupled these messages with an explanation of the importance of bats to ecosystems, agriculture, and biodiversity. Also, in order to discourage bat depopulation, messages emphasized that killing bats would likely result in increased risk for viral transmission due to dispersal of disturbed populations and increases in reproductive rates to compensate for mortality.",

Therefore, a risk-based approach to viral surveillance was utilized. PREDICT country-based teams worked with governmental and nongovernmental partners to identify sites where human activities were resulting in a high level of contact between wildlife and people. Sampling also took place at sites where there were extensive anthropogenic impacts on habitats and landscapes (e.g., not in pristine habitats) adjacent to human communities deemed vulnerable to zoonoses due to a lack of infrastructure for quality food storage, safe hygiene, or accessible health care. Field personnel then conducted sampling specifically at these high-risk human-wildlife interfaces and focused their sampling on the specific taxa\u2014primates, rodents, and bats\u2014for which there was a preponderance of scientific evidence for their role in zoonotic disease emergence.16 Wild animals were live-caught with traps, nets, or remote immobilization techniques, according to established protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) for safe and humane capture, and were released post sampling. Standard morphometric measurements and photographs were obtained to aid species identification. Whole blood, mucosal (oral, nasal, rectal, genital) swabs, feces, and urine (when feasible) were collected from each animal, placed in a variety of media (lysis buffer, viral transport media), and then transferred within hours to \u221280\u00b0C freezers or liquid nitrogen dewars for safe storage until testing. PREDICT also developed and utilized techniques for noninvasive sampling of wildlife for application in circumstances that made safe capture of wildlife difficult or impossible.17 At these sites, qualitative data were collected on the nature and extent of these human-wildlife interactions, and on the presence of domestic animals, water sources, etc.",

For example, PREDICT collected bat samples and integrated wildlife and human response teams to help respond to a Nipah virus outbreak in Bangladesh and participated in several Ebolavirus outbreak response efforts in Uganda by collecting samples from wildlife and domestic livestock and conducting surveys in Ebola-affected communities to better understand how people were coming into contact with wildlife. In 2012, PREDICT provided post-mortem and field investigation support to diagnose a yellow fever outbreak causing mortality in red howler monkeys in Peru, in time for the government to mount a vaccination program to prevent spread to local human communities. During the devastating 2014\u20132015 West Africa Ebolavirus outbreak, PREDICT achieved the early detection of an Ebola virus causing an outbreak in the Equateur Province, Democratic Republic of Congo, which arose independently of the West Africa outbreak. Rapid and accurate detection of the virus facilitated early control procedures by the government, which effectively contained the outbreak before it could spread.",

Working with new governmental and nongovernmental organization partners in 30 countries, the team is documenting viral sharing among diverse hosts and targeting even more intense surveillance at high-risk pathways for viral transmission to identify the social and ecological drivers of pathogen emergence. In particular, PREDICT is addressing the risk of wildlife sold as food and medicine in markets in Asia and Africa, exploring both the magnitude of the conservation and disease risks, as well as the palatability of specific interventions to motivate behavior change. Ultimately, the goal is to provide essential information for helping less developed nations strengthen their capacities for epidemic prevention, thereby contributing to pandemic prevention and improving global health security.",
