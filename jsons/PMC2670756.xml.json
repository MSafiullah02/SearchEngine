RNA pseudoknotting is found in both naturally occurring and in vitro evolved RNA catalysts or ribozymes (Cate et al., 1996, Ferre-D\u2019Amare et al., 1998, Serganov et al., 2005), as well as in many complex folded RNAs and ribonucleoprotein particles (RNPs) including the ribosome and telomerase. Here, pseudoknots play a critical structural or scaffolding role in bringing distant regions of single-stranded RNA together in order to form core helices composed of Watson\u2013Crick base pairs (Adams et al., 2004, Brodersen et al., 2002, Golden et al., 2005, Theimer et al., 2005, Torres-Larios et al., 2006). In addition, pseudoknots are known to play important regulatory roles in translation initiation at internal ribosome entry sites (IRESs) (Otto and Puglisi, 2004, Pfingsten et al., 2006, Pfingsten et al., 2007), in autoregulation of translation initiation (ten Dam et al., 1992, Deckman et al., 1987) and in metabolite-sensing RNAs (Wakeman et al., 2007), where the ribosome binding sequence may be sequestered in a pseudoknotted structure (Gilbert et al., 2008). During translation elongation, the pseudoknot-containing transfer-messenger RNA (tmRNA) mediates rescue of stalled ribosomes that reach the 3\u2032 end of an mRNA lacking a termination codon (Haebel et al., 2004, Moore and Sauer, 2007, Nonin-Lecomte et al., 2006). When found within the coding region of messenger RNA itself, pseudoknots are known to stimulate the efficiency of a number of programmed translational recoding events (Baranov et al., 2002), including stop codon redefinition (Howard et al., 2005) and ribosomal frameshifting (Farabaugh, 1996, Giedroc et al., 2000). The subject of this review is RNA pseudoknots and related RNA motifs that simulate \u22121 programmed ribosomal frameshifting (\u22121 PRF).",

Recent cryo-electron microscopy studies of a putative translocation intermediate stalled over a frameshift site (Namy et al., 2006), mechanical unfolding studies of RNA pseudoknots (Green et al., 2008, Hansen et al., 2007), and NMR structural and thermodynamic studies of a family of evolutionarily closely related frameshifting pseudoknots from plants (Cornish and Giedroc, 2006, Cornish et al., 2005, Cornish et al., 2006b) support the hypothesis that the ability of a frameshift-stimulating pseudoknot to resist the force of mechanical unwinding by the ribosomal mRNA helicase (Takyar et al., 2005) may be more strongly correlated with frameshift stimulation, rather than a specific or unique structural feature(s). This review will summarize these data and place them in the context of our maturing understanding of translation elongation (Wen et al., 2008). The reader is also referred to reviews on RNA pseudoknot structure and function in ribosomal frameshifting and RNA virus replication that have recently appeared (Brierley and Dos Ramos, 2006, Brierley et al., 2007, Staple and Butcher, 2005a).",

If this new base pairing originates with nucleotides within an RNA hairpin loop, the topology is referred to as an H (hairpin)-type pseudoknot, forming a structure composed of two helical stems, S1 and S2, and two non-equivalent loops, L1 and L2 (Fig. 1) (Giedroc et al., 2000). Loop L1 crosses the deep major groove of the lower stem S2, while loop L2 crosses the minor groove side of stem S1. The pseudoknot-forming stem is S2, with S1 considered the hairpin stem. Some H-type pseudoknots contain a third loop (denoted here as L3), often a single unpaired nucleotide, that interrupts the continuous strand at the helical junction; this base can either be extruded from the helix (Egli et al., 2002, Nixon et al., 2002b) or intercalated between the two helical elements (Shen and Tinoco, 1995). Note that two conventions currently exist for the loop\u2013stem nomenclature of hairpin-type pseudoknots that conform to this basic architecture, in which the designations of L2 and L3 are reversed, and are instead identified in order of appearance in the nucleotide sequence (Brierley et al., 2007). In this case, L2 is the loop found at the helical junction between S1 and S2, and L3 is the long loop that straddles the minor groove of the upper stem S1. In this review, we conform to the first convention.",

For example, elongating ribosomes pause or slow down upon encountering classical secondary structures and this ribosomal pausing is often associated with ribosomal recoding events (Baranov et al., 2002). One such recoding event is frameshifting, when the ribosome is directed to move into the \u22121, +1 or +2 reading frames from the reference \u201c0\u201d frame (Harger et al., 2002, Stahl et al., 2002). Programmed ribosomal frameshifting (PRF) allows for translation of two proteins encoded in overlapping reading frames from a single translation initiation site upstream of the 5\u2032 open reading frame (Fig. 2A).",

The efficiency of \u22121 PRF is not 100%, but instead dictates the molar ratio of downstream and upstream proteins ultimately present in the assembling virus. In HIV-1, this ratio is tightly regulated by the virus; molecules that alter the frameshifting levels have significant effects on virus propagation and infectivity (Biswas et al., 2004); in addition, it is known that changing the frameshifting efficiency downward induces results in significantly lower infectivities in both HIV-1 (Dulude et al., 2006) and in murine Moloney leukemia virus, where the translational readthrough signal was replaced with the frameshifting signal from HIV-1 (Gendron et al., 2005). This, in turn has motivated efforts to develop tightly binding molecules as a potential anti-viral strategy (Biswas et al., 2004, Dulude et al., 2008, Park et al., 2008).",

One is a heptanucleotide \u201cslippery site\u201d of the general sequence X XXY YYZ over which the ribosome pauses, e.g., G GGA AAC in pea enation mosaic virus-1 (PEMV-1) (Nixon et al., 2002b), and a downstream RNA pseudoknot, positioned six to eight nucleotides from the 3\u2032 edge of the slip-site (Fig. 2B) (Brierley, 1995). The slip-site alone dramatically increases the intrinsic level of frameshift errors from 0.00005 to \u22480.005 per codon depending strongly on the sequence (Stahl et al., 2002), with the pseudoknot further stimulating this process 10\u201330-fold more. Thus, the pseudoknot induces a subtle, yet critical, perturbation in the kinetic partitioning of the translocating ribosome into the \u22121 frame from the reference frame (see below). In nearly every case that has been examined in detail, a downstream H-type pseudoknot is the stimulatory element. A prominent exception to the pseudoknot as the downstream stimulator is in lentiviruses HIV-1 and SIV, where a bipartite stem\u2013loop structure appears necessary and sufficient to stimulate \u22121 PRF at the gag-pol junction (Gaudin et al., 2005, Marcheschi et al., 2007, Staple and Butcher, 2005b).

For the HIV-1 frameshift signal at least, the bacterial ribosome appears to be fully functional as the eukaryotic ribosome in stimulating frameshifting (Leger et al., 2004). Thus, it is of interest to consider the structure and dynamics (see Section 5 below) of the bacterial 70S ribosome in some detail. Several recent X-ray crystallographic structures of the intact 70S bacterial ribosome either unliganded (Schuwirth et al., 2005) or with various ligands bound (Jenner et al., 2005, Korostelev et al., 2006, Selmer et al., 2006) provide an opportunity to consider \u22121 PRF at the atomic level. These structures along with the previous Thermus thermophilus 70S structure with bound mRNA, and all three tRNAs to modest (3.9\u20135.5 \u00c5) resolution in initiation and post-initiation complexes (Jenner et al., 2007, Yusupov et al., 2001, Yusupova et al., 2006, Yusupova et al., 2001) clearly define the path of the mRNA as it threads through the head and platform of the 30S subunit (shaded purple in the initiation complex, Fig. 3\n). They reveal that the relatively short spacer between the slip-site and the pseudoknot places the pseudoknot in direct contact with the mRNA entry channel of the elongating ribosome, as previously modeled (Giedroc et al., 2000, Plant et al., 2003). The mRNA channel is clearly defined and is contained totally within the 30S subunit, between the head and body, lined with ribosomal proteins S3, S4 and S5 (Fig. 3A) (Brodersen et al., 2002). Recent biochemical experiments reveal that the 70S ribosome has helicase activity (Takyar et al., 2005), which may function by passively trapping transiently unfolded secondary structure by dsRNA binding protein S5; alternatively, the S3/S4/S5 proteins might function as a processivity clamp (Jeruzalmi et al., 2002) positioned at the entrance to the mRNA tunnel (Fig. 3B).",

First, the kink in the mRNA between the A- and P-site codons (Yusupov et al., 2001) is stabilized by a bound Mg2+ (shaded green, Fig. 4\nA). This Mg2+ ion forms outer sphere coordination bonds with the phosphate oxygens of adjacent nucleotides that define the P- and A-site codon boundaries, as well as nucleotides 1401 and 1402 of helix 44 of the 16S RNA (Fig. 4A). These interactions effectively auger the mRNA frame relative to the 30S subunit and may well prevent translation slippage during normal decoding. Secondly, the junction between the D- and anticodon stems of the deacylated P-site tRNA is distorted or kinked toward the A-site (see also Korostelev et al., 2006); relaxation of this deformation may help drive this tRNA into the E-site upon translocation. To prevent this from happening prematurely, there seems to be a molecular \u201cgate\u201d (Fig. 4B) formed by A-minor hydrogen bonding interactions to the P-site tRNA from the 30S head and platform wedged between the P- and E-site tRNAs (Fig. 4B).",

In this structure, one of the E-site codon nucleotides appears to base pair with the E-site tRNA anticodon. This finding supports the idea that during translation, the tRNAs move with the mRNA while maintaining codon\u2013anticodon hydrogen bonding for all three tRNAs, although this has not yet been fully established (Feinberg and Joseph, 2001). In any case, this structure might reflect an intermediate state just prior to base pair dissociation and finally release of the deacylated E-site tRNA. These findings would appear to be relevant for understanding \u22121 PRF since it has recently been shown that mutations in the E-site codon alter the efficiency of \u22121 PRF at least in the context of the HIV-1 frameshift signal; furthermore, mutations in 16S ribosomal RNA that influence HIV-1 frameshifting efficiency map to helices 21 and 22 in the Escherichia coli ribosome, a region previously implicated in translocation and E-site tRNA anticodon binding (Leger et al., 2007). Mutations in this region also influence translocation and in many cases give rise to spontaneous frameshifts (Sergiev et al., 2005). Nonetheless, it remains unclear at this point what precise role the E-site tRNA might play in frameshifting since there is still controversy as to when the E-site tRNA exits the ribosome (Dinos et al., 2005, Spiegel et al., 2007).",

To consider these models, we outline the basic steps of a translational elongation cycle in the context of a ribosome encountering an RNA pseudoknot during decoding (Fig. 5\n) (Joseph, 2003, Moazed and Noller, 1989). During active translation, a ribosome with a vacant A-site accepts a cognate aminoacylated tRNA delivered as a complex with EF-Tu\u00b7GTP (eEF1A\u00b7GTP in eukaryotes). Almost immediately, the peptide on the P-site tRNA is transferred to the fully accommodated A-site aminoacylated tRNA in a reaction catalyzed by the peptidyl transfer center on the large subunit (50S in bacteria; 60S in eukaryotes). Subsequently, the tRNA acceptor ends translocate on the 50S (60S) subunit resulting in a P/E-A/P hybrid state of the ribosome (Dorner et al., 2006, Moazed and Noller, 1989). EF-G\u00b7GTP (eEF2\u00b7GTP in eukaryotes) then binds to the ribosome and drives 30S (40S) translocation returning the ribosome to the classical P/P-E/E state with a vacant A-site. Regardless of which mRNA codons are present in the P- and A-sites of the ribosome, there are only three places in an elongation cycle that a ribosome can frameshift: during accommodation (step 2, Fig. 5), during or immediately following 50S translocation to form the hybrid state (step 3), or during 30S translocation to return to classical state (step 4). It is also possible in fact that \u22121 PRF is capable of occurring at all of these steps, with the precise mechanism perhaps dictated by the frameshifting signal itself.",

Recent structures of the bacterial ribosome obtained by cryo-electron microscopy prepared in different stages of the translation elongation cycle reveal that the ribosome can adopt at least two different conformations, in which the small subunit is oriented differently relative to the large subunit (Frank and Agrawal, 2000, Gao et al., 2003, Valle et al., 2003). Subsequent single-molecule experiments have shown that the bound tRNAs in the pretranslocation state (pre-30S translocation, see Fig. 5) are conformationally dynamic (Blanchard et al., 2004, Lee et al., 2007, Munro et al., 2007). More recently, bacterial ribosomes assembled from subunits specifically labeled with fluorescent probes (Ermolenko et al., 2007) have been shown to spontaneously fluctuate between two states when prepared in either a pretranslocation state or with a single deacyl-tRNA bound in the P-site and prefer the rotated or hybrid state (Cornish et al., 2008). Upon addition of EF-G and the non-hydrolyzable analogue GDPNP, the ribosomes were further stabilized in a rotated or hybrid state (Cornish et al., 2008, Spiegel et al., 2007). In contrast, when these ribosomes lacked tRNA or contained a peptidyl-tRNA in the P-site of the ribosome, i.e., in a pre-50S translocation state (see Fig. 5), the non-rotated or classical state was favored and the dynamic rotational movement of the ribosome was strongly hindered (Cornish et al., 2008).",

            "text": "What does a dynamic ribosome have to do with frameshifting? Since error-free translation likely requires that the A- and P-site tRNAs maintain hydrogen bonding contact with the mRNA during both 50S and 30S translocation, at some point in an elongation cycle with the paused ribosome positioned over the slip-site, these interactions must be broken for frameshifting to occur (Fig. 5). The above studies suggest that the ribosome is most dynamic in the pre-30S (40S) translocation state, i.e., during 50S (60S) translocation or when the ribosome adopts the hybrid state (see Fig. 5). Indeed, a recent study suggests that the tRNA and mRNA interactions with the ribosome are weakened to the point where a change in reading frame, albeit in the 3\u2032 direction, could readily occur provided the translocating tRNA lacks a peptidyl group and a degenerate codon for repairing by the deacylated P-site is available (McGarry et al., 2005). Another study showed that addition of EF-G\u00b7GDPNP further stabilizes the hybrid P/E state allowing for destabilization of the P-site codon\u2013anticodon hydrogen bonding interactions (Spiegel et al., 2007). This is interesting since some tRNAs are known to favor the hybrid state of the ribosome more than others (Cornish et al., 2008, Dorner et al., 2006, Spiegel et al., 2007, Studer et al., 2003); this suggests that different tRNAs may have different propensities to frameshift based on their propensity to form the hybrid conformational state.",

As a result, the new \u22121 reading frame provides near cognate repairing partners for the bound tRNAs. This suggests that the total free energy of codon\u2013anticodon formation of the \u22121 frame will be comparable to that of the reference frame. Since frameshifting does in fact occur over such a sequence, but happens infrequently, a sizable transition state energy barrier to shifting reading frames must be present (see Fig. 4A). A downstream secondary structural element could therefore function by lowering this energy barrier, either by playing an active (mechanical) or passive role in this process.",

            "text": "A mechanical model of frameshift stimulation hypothesizes that the downstream pseudoknot functions as a kinetic barrier to normal translocation, and in so doing, lowers the energy barrier to tRNA\u2013mRNA repairing. It can be imagined that this kinetic barrier would come into play either during spontaneous hybrid states formation (Cornish et al., 2008) (50S translocation) and/or during EF-G\u00b7GTP driven translocation (30S translocation) (see Fig. 5) (Namy et al., 2006). In both cases, movement of the ribosomal subunits may cause tension to build up in the mRNA strand due to the downstream structural element positioned in the mRNA entry channel. This tension could then be released via \u22121 PRF (Plant et al., 2003). Consistent with these models, prior studies have demonstrated that tRNAs can translocate on the ribosome in the absence of an mRNA (Belitsina et al., 1981, Belitsina et al., 1982). Alternatively, the downstream RNA element may function simply as a passive barrier, by pausing the ribosome over the slippery sequence for a time sufficient for repairing to occur, as the ribosomal helicase attempts to unwind whatever secondary structure is present in the mRNA entry channel (Takyar et al., 2005). However, such a model would appear to be inconsistent with biochemical experiments that suggested that pausing is necessary (Lopinski et al., 2000) but not sufficient to induce \u22121 PRF (Kontos et al., 2001, Tu et al., 1992). It is also plausible that the paused ribosome may actually be in equilibrium between the XXY YYZ and XXX YYY reading frame states while in the hybrid state (see Fig. 5). The binding of EF-G\u00b7GTP to the ribosome would then trap the ribosome in one of the two reading frames prior to 30S (40S) translocation and a return to the classical state. In this context, it would be of interest to investigate the influence of a downstream structural element(s) on hybrid states formation by the translating ribosome. In any event, these studies taken collectively make it most likely that tRNA\u2013mRNA codon\u2013anticodon interactions are broken when the ribosome is in the hybrid conformational state.",

Although solved at low resolution, these reconstructions reveal several significant features. Firstly, as expected (Yusupova et al., 2001), the pseudoknot lies at the entrance to the mRNA channel apparently making direct contact with elements of the putative ribosomal helicase, including rpos3 (bacterial S3), 16S helix 16, rpS9 (S4) and rpS2 (S5), as well as the ribosome regulatory protein RACK1 (Fig. 6B). More importantly, this structure contains eEF2 trapped in the A-site, with the D-helix of the P-site tRNA strongly bent, relative to control reconstructions with a non-frameshift-stimulating stem\u2013loop RNA. Thus, the movement of the tRNA through the ribosome during translocation appears to be prevented by the inability of the ribosome to unwind the pseudoknot, and blockage of the A-site mRNA codon by eEF2. The P-site tRNA strongly bends toward the 3\u2032 direction (or A-site codon) (Fig. 6B) more so than in the structures above (Namy et al., 2006, Selmer et al., 2006) thought to be due to the opposing forces of translocation and the pseudoknot plug. At some frequency, the P-site tRNA unpairs and repairs in the new \u22121 frame (in the 5\u2032 direction), a proposal consistent with a major role of specifically the P-site tRNA in this process (Baranov et al., 2004). After this time, the tension built up in the mRNA is relaxed, and the incoming aminoacylated tRNA is delivered to the A-site in the new \u22121 reading frame (Fig. 6C).",

Since both eEF2 and a P-site tRNA are bound, this suggests that the ribosome is in the hybrid conformation state, a state that would be favored with a deacylated tRNA in the P-site (Spiegel et al., 2007). At 16 \u00c5 resolution, however, it is not clear if the P-site tRNA observed in the structure is deacylated, nor can it be determined what reading frame the mRNA is actually in. On the other hand, the clearly defined electron density observed for the pseudoknot strongly suggests that the pseudoknot is largely folded as the ribosome shifts reading frames. The hypothesis that emerges from this work is that the ability of the downstream pseudoknot to actively lower the energy barrier for unpairing of the P-site codon\u2013anticodon interaction will be more strongly correlated with frameshift stimulation. By extension, RNA motifs more capable of resisting the force of ribosomal helicase-mediated unwinding and eEF2 (EF-G)-catalyzed translocation will thus be more efficient frameshift stimulators. The structural data summarized here further suggests that the helical junction in at least one class of frameshifting pseudoknots is a \u201chot-spot\u201d or positive determinant for frameshift stimulation (Cornish et al., 2005).",

As such, the MMTV pseudoknot has long provided a basis of comparison with all \u22121 PRF-stimulating RNA motifs subsequently discovered and characterized (for a review, see Giedroc et al., 2000). These include the coronaviral pp1a\u2013pp1b signals characterized first in avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) nearly coincidently with the RSV and MMTV gag-pro signals (Brierley et al., 1987, Brierley et al., 1989, Brierley et al., 1991), followed by other structurally characterized retroviral gag-pol and gag-pro signals, most notably that from HIV-1 (Parkin et al., 1992) and the simian retrovirus-1, SRV-1 (Du et al., 1997, Michiels et al., 2001, ten Dam et al., 1994, ten Dam et al., 1995).

            "text": "Although an atomic structure of the minimal IBV pp1a/pp1b pseudoknot remains unavailable 20 years after its discovery (Brierley et al., 1987), the major functional requirements of the IBV frameshifting signal relative to the retroviral-type gag-pro pseudoknot from MMTV could be deduced from mutational studies (Chen et al., 1995, Liphardt et al., 1999, Napthine et al., 1999). The major difference was in the length of the stem S1 (Fig. 7), with 11 bp, or one turn of A-form helix, clearly optimal for the IBV pseudoknot vs. 5\u20136 bp in the MMTV gag-pro pseudoknot. Remarkably, a 10-bp stem S1 induces a dramatic \u22487-fold decrease in frameshift stimulation (46\u20137%) in the IBV pseudoknot, while shorter S1 stems are effectively inactive in promoting frameshifting in this context (Napthine et al., 1999). Structural features specific to the MMTV pseudoknot include an unpaired adenosine (A14) that is wedged between the two stems (pseudoknot loop L3; see Fig. 1, Fig. 8\n) thereby creating a bent structure that prevents coaxial stacking of the helical stems, as well as a number of loop L2\u2013stem S1 interactions (Shen and Tinoco, 1995). The presence of this \u201cwedge\u201d adenosine is strongly positively correlated with frameshift stimulation since deletion of the nucleotide reduces frameshifting efficiencies to low levels (Shen and Tinoco, 1995). Atkins and co-workers have made a similar finding in a retroviral-type frameshifter found in the human gene Ma3 (Wills et al., 2006). Thermodynamic studies reveal that the unpaired adenosine is globally stabilizing in the gag-pro pseudoknots from MMTV and mouse intercisternal A-type particle (mIAP), but by just \u22480.5 kcal mol\u22121 (37 \u00b0C) (Theimer and Giedroc, 1999, Theimer and Giedroc, 2000).",

These findings argue strongly for two distinct structural classes of frameshifting pseudoknots, one with a full helical turn of stem S1 and few other obvious structural requirements, and one with a much shorter stem S1 that seemed to require favorable interactions at the helical junction region to mediate high levels of frameshift stimulation. Subsequent structural studies with the gag-pro signal from SRV-1 further suggested that it was not the bent conformation of the retroviral gag-pro pseudoknot that was positively correlated with frameshifting since this structure is characterized by coaxially stacked S1 and S2 helices, but rather favorable loop L2\u2013stem S1 interactions, a subset of which are found in the helical junction region (see Fig. 8B) (Michiels et al., 2001).",

Each is characterized by an 11-bp helical stem and a highly ordered hairpin loop. The HIV-1 stem\u2013loop contains an ACAA tetraloop characterized by an A20\u2013A23 hydrogen bond, while the 12-nucleotide SIV/HIV-2 loop incorporates a sheared G28-A39 base pair, a cross-strand adenosine stack formed by A29 and A38, two G-C base pairs, and a novel CYC triloop turn sequence (Fig. 8D). Each loop is characterized by multiple hydrogen bonding interactions that stabilize the overall structure (see Fig. 8C and D) (Marcheschi et al., 2007, Staple and Butcher, 2005b) and as such, are predicted to preclude base pairing with the adjacent 3\u2032 region that would be required to form a pseudoknot, as proposed previously for HIV-1 (Dinman et al., 2002). Both the HIV-1 and SIV signals also contain a lower, more dynamic stem (shaded yellow in the HIV-1 RNA, Fig. 8C) that when base paired comes closer to the 3\u2032 edge of the slippery sequence than do the downstream pseudoknots in other systems (see Fig. 7) (Marcheschi et al., 2007); in HIV-1, these two helical stems are interrupted by an asymmetric three-nucleotide G35-G36-A37 bulge (Fig. 8C). Since the lower stem in both HIV-1 and SIV RNAs will be unfolded when the ribosome is positioned over the slippery signal, its function is unclear. In HIV-1, it has been hypothesized that the lower stem functions as a \u201cpositioning element\u201d that allows the stem\u2013loop to induce ribosomal pausing which in turn mediates a translocation perturbation; how this occurs at the molecular level is unknown (Staple and Butcher, 2005b). It is also intriguing that both HIV-1 and SIV/HIV-2 stem\u2013loop structures, like stem S1 in the IBV pp1a\u2013pp1b pseudoknot, are 11 bp in length, perhaps suggesting a similar mechanism of frameshift stimulation, but potentially enhanced by a very slippery UUUUUUA slip-site (Brierley et al., 1992).",

This RNA is compact and adopts a largely triple-stranded conformation, with many of the loop nucleotides making non-canonical base\u2013base and base\u2013sugar edge hydrogen bonds with base pairs in each of the two stems. For example, a protonated C8+ from loop L1 forms a standard Hoogsteen-type base pair with an accepting G12 as part of a C8+\u00b7(G12-C26) base triple positioned at the \u201ctop\u201d of the S2 helical junction (Fig. 9A). Thermodynamic and structural studies of three other luteoviral RNA pseudoknots confirm that this C+\u00b7(C-G) major groove triple base pair is a common feature of all luteoviral RNA pseudoknots (see Fig. 9B\u2013D) (Nixon et al., 2002a, Nixon and Giedroc, 2000), protonation of which is strongly stabilizing. The degree to which protonation of this cytidine affects frameshifting efficiency or mechanical stability (Tinoco et al., 2006) remains unknown.",

Briefly, residues C24 through A27 all point their Watson\u2013Crick edges into the S1 minor groove where they are engaged in numerous hydrogen-bonding interactions. In addition to A27 and A25 discussed above, the N1/N6 face of A26 forms two hydrogen bonds with the N3\u2013N2 edge of G7. C24 also points into the S1 minor groove, with the N4 amino group close to the 2\u2032-OH of G17. A23 is stacked on C24, with the Watson\u2013Crick edge rotated out of the stack, leaving the N7 and N6 nitrogens within hydrogen bonding distance of the 2\u2032-OH of G17. At this point, the PEMV-1 structure diverges from the BWYV/PLRV structures, with A22 stacked on A23, and essentially extruded from of the triple helix, with A21 inserted back into the S1 minor groove near the top two S1 base pairs. G20 is extrahelical. In fact, if one considers A22 an extrahelical insertion in the PEMV-1 loop L2, the entire 5\u2032-A(A)ACAAA loop sequence adopts essentially identical conformations in all three pseudoknots (Fig. 10D\u2013F).",

The unexpected finding from these experiments was that the C27A ScYLV RNA is a very poor frameshift stimulator in vitro (Cornish et al., 2005). This surprising finding, in turn, made the prediction that substitution of A25 in the BWYV RNA with cytidine (A25C) would increase frameshifting in this context; this is exactly what was found. Thus, a 3\u2032 L2 cytidine is a positive determinant for frameshift stimulation by luteoviral RNAs (Cornish et al., 2006b). Strikingly, the global structure of the C27A ScYLV RNA is nearly indistinguishable from the wild-type counterpart, despite the fact that the helical junction region is altered and incorporates the anticipated isostructural A27\u00b7(G7-C14) minor groove base triple (Cornish et al., 2006b) in adopting a helical junction region that is superimposable with that of the beet western yellows virus (BWYV) pseudoknot (Su et al., 1999), as expected. These results suggest that the global \u201cground-state\u201d structure is not strongly correlated with frameshift stimulation and point to a reduced stability that derives from an altered helical junction architecture in the C27A ScYLV RNA as of significant functional importance, for which there is some evidence (Cornish and Giedroc, 2006, Cornish et al., 2005).",

In fact, in luteoviral pseudoknots, insertion or deletion of an unpaired and extrahelical residue(s) near the \u201ctop\u201d of loop L2 often strongly increases frameshifting efficiency, a finding often attributed to a direct interaction with the ribosome (Kim et al., 2000, Kim et al., 1999). We have argued that distinct unfolding thermodynamics measured for closely related RNAs, e.g., WT vs. C27A ScYLV RNAs, may in fact be reporting on different kinetics of pseudoknot unfolding, with increased rates of unfolding, i.e., unfolding at lower applied forces, negatively correlated with frameshift stimulation (Giedroc et al., 2000, Theimer and Giedroc, 2000). In other words, these studies suggest the hypothesis that the helical junction in luteoviral RNAs is mechanically stable and functions as a classic kinetic barrier (Onoa et al., 2003) to force-induced unfolding, essentially placing the unfolding of the entire pseudoknot under kinetic control. This barrier is predicted to be altered in functionally compromised RNAs. Mechanical force-induced unfolding/refolding experiments will be required to obtain direct evidence for this proposal (see below).",

Since the translocating ribosome places force on the downstream mRNA (Wen et al., 2008) while engaging in either active or passive unwinding of secondary structure, understanding the mechanical stability of pseudoknots toward force-induced unfolding over a force regime thought to be achievable by the ribosome is of considerable interest. Two groups have now investigated the extent to which various IBV pp1a\u2013pp1b derived frameshifting pseudoknots that differ in their frameshifting efficiencies are unfolded as a function of force in an optical trapping or tweezers experiment (Green et al., 2008, Hansen et al., 2007). Here, the pseudoknot is attached to two microbeads via annealing to long \u2248500 nucleotide ssDNA handles immobilized on the bead, with one bead held in an optical trap and the other held on the tip of a micropipette by suction (Liphardt et al., 2001). Both groups compared 11- and 10-bp S1-containing IBV pseudoknots which stimulate frameshifting to very different degrees (Napthine et al., 1999); loop L2 lengths were also different in the two studies. Note that these experiments investigated the intrinsic mechanical properties of the pseudoknot itself in isolation and in the absence of bound or stalled ribosomes.",

            "text": "In the more limited of the two studies, Hansen et al. (2007) measured simple repetitive stretching-relaxation unfolding\u2013folding trajectories and showed that the RNA with the 11-bp stem S1 appear to require approximately two-fold greater unfolding force than the 10-bp construct, with the 10-bp construct more often than not unfolding in multiple steps relative to the 11-bp RNA. In contrast, Green et al. (2008) saw no clear correlation between frameshifting efficiency and the mechanical force required to unfold the RNAs; however, the work made several striking observations. Mg2+ strongly stabilizes the kinetic and thermodynamic stability of the \u201cwild-type\u201d IBV pseudoknot, with an unfolding transition state very close to the folded structure in the presence of Mg2+ (Green et al., 2008). This means that the pseudoknot is a \u201cbrittle\u201d structure (Onoa et al., 2003) with a correspondingly very shallow dependence of the unfolding rate on applied force (measured at three different pulling rates) (Li et al., 2006a, Li et al., 2006b); the rate of unfolding is also much slower than component hairpin structures. Both features are in striking contrast to the component hairpins and the unfolding of the partially folded intermediates that lack pseudoknot tertiary pairing (Green et al., 2008). Thus, the pseudoknot tertiary structure is clearly characterized by unique mechanical properties relative to component RNA hairpins (Green et al., 2008). It will be interesting to determine the degree to which the tertiary structure of frameshifting pseudoknots from other structural classes (Cornish et al., 2005, Michiels et al., 2001) and the stem\u2013loop structures from HIV-1 and SIV/HIV-2 gag-pol shift sites (Marcheschi et al., 2007, Staple and Butcher, 2005b) (see Fig. 7, Fig. 8, Fig. 9) form \u201cbrittle\u201d structures distinct from compliant RNA hairpins (Li et al., 2006b).",

            "text": "Although these studies focus on the unfolding rate as critical for frameshift stimulation by individual ribosome-pseudoknot encounters, the number of translocating ribosomes on a single mRNA molecule might also have a detectable influence on ensemble average frameshifting efficiency (Lopinski et al., 2000). In this model, the rate of refolding the downstream stimulatory element after unfolding and decoding by the first ribosome may have a significant impact on overall frameshift efficiency because a lagging ribosome(s) may encounter a stimulatory element that remains unfolded. This model predicts that the rate of translation initiation, or loading of successive ribosomes, on a mRNA containing a frameshift signal might have a detectable influence on overall frameshifting efficiency. Recent support for this idea has recently been published for HIV-1-infected cells in culture (Gendron et al., 2008), in which the presence of a low concentration of the upstream transactivation response element (TAR) RNA, known to be present in the cytoplasm of virus-infected cells as a free RNA, activates protein kinase R (PKR) which in turn phosphorylates the translation initiation factor eIF2\u03b1, effectively halting translation initiation (Sadler and Williams, 2007). Although it is not known precisely how HIV-1 manipulates translation initiation to appropriately express the genome, this suggests that frameshifting efficiency may well be determined by the number of ribosomes engaged in translation elongation on a single mRNA.",

For example, a recent study reports the use of optical trapping methods to observe single ribosomes translocating through an RNA stem\u2013loop structure via continuous measurement of the end-to-end length of the mRNA as it is unwound by the ribosome (Wen et al., 2008). The most striking observation from these studies, among many, is that while the ribosome moves in discrete translocation steps of three nucleotides or one codon over 0.1 s on average, this step-wise movement is punctuated by pauses of a very wide time duration (seconds to minutes) (Wen et al., 2008). Thus, under these conditions, ribosomal pausing is rate-determining for protein synthesis; this in turn, creates a mechanistic scenario that can be directly exploited by recoding signals embedded in the mRNA that are dependent on ribosomal pausing, like \u22121 PRF (Blanchard, 2008). Indeed, of the two rate-determining steps for pausing, one step that preceded translocation was force-dependent (Wen et al., 2008); it seems possible that this step might be reporting on the action of the ribosomal helicase as it attempts to unwind the stem\u2013loop. In any case, this finding provides support for the hypothesis that mRNA tension implicit in any mechanical model of ribosomal frameshifting might strongly influence ribosomal movement in a functionally relevant way.",
