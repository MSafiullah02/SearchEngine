She was commenced on intravenous clarithromycin and cefuroxime but became tachypnoeic and was unable to maintain oxygen saturation.

The baby weighing 1.2kgs with Apgars of 2 1 minute and 6 5 minutes and required intubation because of prematurity. The baby was negative for nasopharyngeal, amniotic fluid and placental swabs RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 and was weaned off ventilation after 10 days. Table 1 shows that maternal symptoms can be variable and of interest is that cough (8/9) and anosmia (7/9) appear to be the commonest presentations in this small series. We had initially followed advice from Chinese literature which recommended isolation of the infected woman and her baby for 14 days 2 .
