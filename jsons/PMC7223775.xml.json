            "text": "Most paid caregivers provide services with love and compassion. Caregiving can produce both positive and negative effects on the caregiver (Harmell et al. 2011; Hastings and Horne 2004). However, in the long term, it often leads to stress, burnout, and compassion fatigue in the caregivers. They experience psychological stress as a result of their emotional and physiological reactions when they are unable to cope with their job-related demands. Burnout is \u201ca persistent, negative, work-related state of mind in \u2018normal\u2019 individuals that is primarily characterized by exhaustion, which is accompanied by distress, a sense of reduced effectiveness, decreased motivation, and the development of dysfunctional attitudes and behavior at work\u201d (Schaufeli and Buunk 2003, p. 388). It results from the cumulative effects of persistent occupational stress and may evidence as emotional exhaustion, irritability, frustration, general anxiety, dysthymia, insomnia, and loss of work effectiveness (Maslach et al. 2001). Compassion fatigue is the reduced capacity of the caregiver to be empathic due to the constant demands of caregiving. It often leads to reduced productivity, increased absenteeism of the caregiver, low levels of personal effectiveness, and personal psychological distress that may compromise the quality of caregiving (Adams et al. 2006; Epp 2012; Quenot et al. 2012).",

            "text": "Caregivers of individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities are known to exhibit high levels of stress and burnout (Skirrow & Hatton 2007). For example, research indicates between 25 and 32% of caregivers surveyed report stress and burnout (Hastings et al. 2004; Hatton et al. 1999). Many factors have been found to elevate caregiver stress, including the nature and severity of challenging behaviors of the clients, work conditions, degree of management support for the staff, in-service training, and career path issues (Devereux et al. 2009a, b). As a result, some caregivers engage in informal but often less than optimal coping strategies to manage their rising stress, including the use of substances, emotional eating\u2014typically unhealthy foods\u2014and other lifestyle changes (Piko 1999). The cumulative effects of heightened stress often lead to health complications, ranging from minor but persistent coughs and colds to chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular diseases and diabetes (Melamed et al. 2006). When caregivers are stressed at their workplace, there is high likelihood that their productivity declines, clients receive less caregiver attention and assistance, and there is decreased social interaction (Rose et al. 1998), as well as increased risk for physical and mental abuse of the clients (White et al. 2003). Eventually, there is increased caregiver absenteeism and turnover that leads to a decline in the quality of care and loss of continuity of care (Lin et al. 2009).",

Given that clients\u2019 behaviors often lead to caregiver stress, an early approach has been to teach caregivers effective behavioral techniques that would enable them to better manage their clients\u2019 challenging behaviors. Research suggests that when used with consistency and procedural fidelity, behavior management procedures\u2014especially in the form of positive behavior support\u2014are very effective in controlling aggressive and other disruptive behaviors of clients (MacDonald 2016; Morris and Horner 2016). However, there has been little evidence to show that caregiver stress is appreciably reduced, probably because other extenuating factors related to job stress remain. Indeed, there is some evidence to suggest that caregiver stress is exacerbated by the demands of implementing such procedures under adverse conditions (Allen et al. 2005; Didden et al. 2016).",

In another study, caregivers were reported to have decreased stress, enhanced psychological well-being, and increased job satisfaction following a training course that included elements of mindfulness and positive psychology (Brooker et al. 2013). While certainly effective in reducing caregiver stress, this approach does not speak to the challenging behaviors of the clients.",

This approach combines mindfulness-based procedures that teach caregivers how to take care of themselves in a mindful manner, which reduces their stress, and to more skillfully use positive behavior support interventions with their clients, which reduces the clients\u2019 challenging behaviors (Singh et al. 2016a). For example, in a multiple baseline design study, Singh et al. (2015) evaluated the effects of a Mindfulness-Based Positive Behavior Support (MBPBS) course for caregivers. The results showed reduced caregiver psychological stress, no caregiver turnover, and gradual reduction and elimination of the use of physical restraints for aggressive behaviors of the clients. These findings were replicated and extended in a proof-of-concept quasi-experimental study (Singh et al. 2016b). Finally, in a randomized controlled trial that compared the effects of MBPBS against a treatment-as-usual control condition, MBPBS was comparatively more effective than treatment-as-usual in reducing the caregivers\u2019 perceived psychological stress, use of physical restraints, and the need for emergency medications for the aggressive behavior of their clients (Singh et al. 2016c). Furthermore, the results indicated a strong correlation between caregiver training in MBPBS and statistically significant reductions in the aggressive behavior of the clients.",

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the comparative effects of MBPBS and PBS alone on caregiver variables (i.e., perceived stress, compassion satisfaction, compassion fatigue), client variables (i.e., frequency of aggressive behavior, staff injury, peer injury), and agency variables (i.e., use of physical restraints, emergency medication, one-to-one staffing, staff turnover, cost-effectiveness).",

In general, the training format included cross-setting multidisciplinary collaboration, the use of a case study format with an actual client, a dynamic training process that emphasized principles of PBS derived from its practical applications, and an emphasis on comprehensive outcome goals. Training included the development of support strategies based on setting-specific functional assessment that were proactive and could be maintained in the natural environment of the clients. The focus of the PBS plan was on developing and strengthening positive behavior more than on managing or eliminating challenging behaviors, with the intent of enhancing each client\u2019s long-term quality of life.

For several count variables that represent ratio-level data, a group count for an entire condition was used instead of a count for individuals within a condition. These variables included the number of aggressive events per week, the number of physical restraints used per week, the number of emergency medication administrations per week, and the number of additional one-to-one staffing needed per week. As these variables are not at the individual level, they do not lend themselves to traditional analyses for RCTs. Therefore, change across time within each condition was examined by treating each group as an n of 1. In doing so, we plotted the count of each variable for each condition across all weeks of the study. Multiple linear regression (MLR) was used to estimate to what extent the client and caregiver variables were predicted by intervention type (MBPBS vs. PBS) after controlling for the effect of time. Effect size in regression analysis is reflected by R2 (which is the percentage of variance explained by the linear relationship between two variables) and specific effects by R2 change, which is interpreted as R2 of 0.02 = small, 0.15 = medium, and 0.26 = large (Cohen 1988). All study variables were tested and met assumptions of MLR: skewness and kurtosis values within \u00b1 1, no significant outliers, and no evidence of multicollinearity (variance inflating factor < 5).",

Both PBS and MBPBS have similar general intent in improving quality of life outcomes, but with very different underlying philosophies and purported mechanisms of change. In broad terms, PBS is a science-based experimental discipline that focuses on changing behavior (Hieneman and Fefer 2017; Lucyshyn et al. 2015), while mindfulness (without PBS) is an experiential approach to training one\u2019s own mind to behave (Kabat-Zinn 1994). The two approaches are synergistic, and regardless of their purported underlying mechanisms, both are open to scrutiny using traditional methods of scientific inquiry. Thus, the braiding of these two approaches in MBPBS for reducing caregiver stress and for enhancing the quality of life of the clients makes perfect clinical sense. The mindfulness-based procedures provide the experiential component that enables caregivers to manage their stress, and the PBS procedures enable them to more effectively manage the behavior of their clients.",

Furthermore, it is worth considering the impact of system-wide implementation of mindfulness-based interventions, such as MBPBS, that may change the life-course of not only the recipients of the training but also their clients because of the immeasurable downstream effects across generations. Another important consideration is the growing interest in integrated health care approaches that combine complementary and conventional treatments for disease prevention and health promotion (Khorsan et al. 2011). Mindfulness-based procedures offer a valuable addition to an integrated health care approach, especially for the management challenges associated with chronic conditions, such as Alzheimer\u2019s disease.
