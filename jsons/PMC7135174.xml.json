Increasing migration, international air travel, tourism, and work visits to tropical regions have contributed to an increased incidence of such diseases being seen in the United States, United Kingdom, and Europe.9, 10 Climate change and global warming (with a resulting increase in average and nadir temperatures) may be causing tropical diseases and vectors to spread to higher altitudes in mountainous regions, and to higher latitudes that were previously spared, such as the southern United States and the Mediterranean area. The last decade of the twentieth century was marked by a resurgence in tropical diseases being encountered in countries outside the tropics, such as the United States, including Chagas disease, a chronic, systemic, parasitic infection caused by the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi, and vector-borne viral encephalitides.3, 9 Other previously rare, but presently emerging, diseases from particular geographic areas include leptospirosis, trypanosomiasis, giardiasis, and viral hemorrhagic fever. Bites from several animal species, including snakes, scorpions, and jellyfish, cause much morbidity and mortality from envenomation and secondary infections. Skin diseases are common in travelers returning from the tropics.3\n",

            "text": "The increasing success rates of solid organ and hematopoietic stem cell transplantations, with advances in immunosuppression, make transplants an early therapeutic option for many diseases affecting a considerable number of people worldwide. Thus, transplant programs in Western countries, as well as those in developing countries, have started to face the impact of neglected tropical diseases transmitted via the donor tissue.11 More posttransplantation respiratory viral, bacterial, protozoal, and fungal infections are being recognized. It is imperative that physicians globally are aware of the wide spectrum of tropical, infectious, and parasitic diseases to which their patients may have been exposed. It is prudent to enquire about travel history and geographic origins early in consultations, to aid early diagnosis and treatment and thereby prevent poor outcomes in many patients. An extensive enquiry into the travel history is prudent because certain tropical infectious diseases can first present years or even decades after the last tropical travel, including malaria (Plasmodium ovale and Plasmodium vivax), trypanosomiases (T cruzi and Trypanosoma brucei gambiense), strongyloidiasis (Strongyloides stercoralis), filariases, and schistosomiasis (any Schistosoma spp). It is imperative to consider the possibility of a tropical disease in cases that are difficult to diagnose, even potentially in those without a suggestive travel history. For example, malaria can occur in patients who have not traveled overseas, being acquired near city airports where mosquitoes imported on aircraft arriving from the tropics can survive and transmit the infection during the summer months.12 A high degree of clinical awareness of the possibility of a tropical disease enables an early diagnosis to be made and enables effective treatment measures to be initiated, reducing morbidity and mortality.",

The classification of infectious and tropical diseases, and their treatment, control, and prevention, have historically involved the joint efforts of epidemiologists, microbiologists, and clinicians.",

Physicians also tend to classify infectious diseases according to the most important organ or organ system to be affected, or the important clinical manifestations of the specific disease (Table 2\n).13, 14 Microbiologists tend to prefer classifying infectious diseases according to the classic microbiological nomenclature codes of kingdom, phylum, class, order, family, genus, and species and have large standard textbooks that give detailed classification and nomenclature.15 They relate information according to microscopic appearance after staining or culture characteristics, to advise the clinician on the most appropriate antibiotic therapy and management. However, with advances in molecular technology, microorganisms are frequently being reclassified and renamed. For example Rickettsia tsutsugamushi, the causal agent for scrub typhus, has been reclassified into the genus Orientia. DF-2 is now known as Capnocytophaga canimorsus.16 Epidemiologists usually describe tropical disease in terms of person, place, time, and exposure, with a view to developing control and prevention strategies to limit the spread of the diseases in the community. They often classify infectious diseases according to their distribution, their means of transmission, and according to their reservoirs in nature. Such classifications use the routes of transmission or acquisition of the infectious disease (Table 3\n).",

Pathologic reports often describe the presence of a granuloma in biopsy tissue and the tissue may be processed with special stains, molecular methods, or culture to try to identify further. A granuloma17, 18, 19 is defined as a chronic, compact collection of inflammatory cells in which mononuclear cells predominate, usually formed as a result of an undegradable product, in the case of tropical infectious diseases; examples are given in Table 4\n. Some of the organisms contained within the granuloma remain viable, and these can reactivate to cause active disease when the patient becomes immunosuppressed from HIV or immunosuppressive therapy. Tuberculosis in HIV-infected individuals or in those on anti-TNF-\u03b1 therapy, and Chagas disease in transplant recipients, are classic examples.

The Global Health Observatory (GHO)21 is a unique and useful service providing a gallery of global maps illustrating the prevalence of an extensive list of major health topics including tropical diseases, which are updated on a regular basis. These maps are classified by disease themes, including all major infectious and parasitic diseases. Each theme page provides information on the global situation, prevalence, and trends, using core indicators, database views, publications, and links to relevant Web pages. The GHO also issues analytical reports on the current situation and trends for priority health issues. A key output of the GHO is the annual publication World Health Statistics, which compiles statistics for key health indicators and also includes a brief report on progress toward health-related Millennium Development Goals. In addition, the GHO provides analytical reports on cross-cutting topics such as the report on women and health and burden of disease.",
