Approximately 80% of infected patients are asymptomatic or have mild symptoms such as fever or cough, while rest of the patients have varying degrees of severity of symptoms, with 3-4% mortality rate. Severe symptoms such as pneumonia and Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome can be caused by tissue damage mostly due to aggravated and unresolved innate and adaptive immune response, often resulting from a cytokine storm. However, the mechanistic underpinnings of such responses remain elusive, with an incomplete understanding of how an intricate interplay among infected cells and cells of innate and adaptive immune system can lead to such diverse clinicopathological outcomes. Here, we use a dynamical systems approach to dissect the emergent nonlinear intra-host dynamics among virally infected cells, the immune response to it and the consequent immunopathology. By mechanistic analysis of cell-cell interactions, we have identified key parameters affecting the diverse clinical phenotypes associated with COVID-19. This minimalistic yet rigorous model can explain the various phenotypes observed across the clinical spectrum of COVID-19, various co-morbidity risk factors such as age and obesity, and the effect of antiviral drugs on different phenotypes. It also reveals how a fine-tuned balance of infected cell killing and resolution of inflammation can lead to infection clearance, while disruptions can drive different severe phenotypes. These results will help further the case of rational selection of drug combinations that can effectively balance viral clearance and minimize tissue damage simultaneously.",

Nearly 80% of patients infected by the virus are either largely asymptomatic or show mild to moderate symptoms such as fever or cough. However, in a subset of patients, symptoms such as shortness of breath or pneumonia develop, thus requiring subsequent hospitalization. In a small percent of cases, severe pneumonia can aggravate to Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), septic shock and multiple organ failure (1) . Furthermore, there is diversity in the degree of ARDS and/or other pathological conditions observed within hospitalized patients; some, but not all, of them are admitted to Intensive Care Units (ICU) and require the support from mechanical ventilators. Higher age and/or pre-existing conditions such as diabetes or hypertension can serve as other comorbidities, thus influencing the severity of the disease and posing a higher risk of death to patients (2) . SARS-CoV-2 infection activates both innate and adaptive immune responses. These responses are responsible for viral clearance. In addition to neutralizing and eliminating the virus, the immune response may cause harmful tissue damage at both the local and systemic levels, when the regulatory mechanisms are dysfunctional. In a subset of individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 dysregulated immune responses are observed, manifesting as a cytokine storm (3) (4) (5) , which is reminiscent of immunopathology seen in other corona-viruses SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (6) . These observations suggest that the degree of dysregulation of immune response is likely to be an important factor, in addition to viral load, in determining the severity of COVID-19 (7, 8) .",

ACE2 and/or TMPRSS2 have been seen to be present in multiple organs -lung, liver, colon, kidney, gut and placenta among others (10-13) making these organs potential targets of the SARS-CoV-2. Preliminary evidence suggests that similar to SARS-CoV (14) , SARS-CoV-2 primarily targets type II alveolar cells (15, 16) ; thus, lung remains the primary organ of infection.

First, SARS-CoV-2 virus can replicate in infected cells and consequently infect other healthy cells in a logistic growth fashion (rate: kv). Second, the virus itself or the infected cells can elicit an innate immune response via pattern recognition receptors expressed on the immune cells or through the production of cytokines and chemokines that can attract other cells of innate immune system such as neutrophils, natural killer cells, monocytes and macrophages (rate: kvm) (23) . For the purpose of simplicity, we have combined the response of all these individual innate immune cell populations into one entity represented as innate immune cells (M). Third, innate immune system cells can induce recruitment and/or proliferation of other cells of innate immune system via the production of cytokines or chemokines (rate: kmm), enabling a self-sustaining response in the presence of infected cells (24) .

We observed that the clearance time of the virus decreases drastically with an increased killing rate of infected cells via the innate immune cells (dmv) (Fig 1B) , suggesting that the initial response mounted by the body to the virus might be paramount in resolving the infection at an early stage. This trend is qualitatively maintained for other values of kv (Fig S1A) . The parameter kv can be considered as a representation for net infectivity of the virus, which can be a result of the replication rate of the virus inside the host (for instance, kv can be decreased by intracellular interferon response in infected cells (29) ), its exit efficiency from the cells, its survival outside host cells and the viral infection rate of neighboring healthy host cells. Therefore, as expected, the higher the rate of growth of infected cells kv, the higher the peak of infected cells and the more is the time required to clear the infection (Fig S1B) . Thus, these results suggest that some strains of the virus that may have an inherent lower C D F kv kvm kmm dmv dvm B E infection/proliferation/survival rates can get cleared more efficiently than those that are highly virulent.",

We hypothesized that the rate of resolution of innate immune cells via selfsuppression as the number of infected cells decrease (dvm) is a crucial parameter that affects immuno-pathology in the system. To test this hypothesis, we monitored the infected cell population in the system at the end of 30 days as a function of both dmv and dvm ( Fig  1C) . It is expected that the higher the dmv, the smaller the number of infected cells at the end of 30 days, irrespective of the value of dvm. One would expect that the rate of resolution of innate immune system (dvm) will minimally affect the levels of infected cells, because the resolution is thought to be triggered after the clearance of infected cells and hence has very little role to play in the clearance itself. This fact holds true for low values of dvm, but surprisingly not for higher values of dvm (Fig 1C) . At high values of dvm, some viral load (in the form of infected cells) persists, while there is complete clearance at lower values of dvm (Fig S1D) . It is, however, important to note here that the peak number of virally infected cells depends primarily on kv and dmv (Fig S1E) but not on dvm (Fig S1F) . This dynamics may be one among many contributing factors to persistence of the virus as seen in other diseases such as HCV (31) . The persistence of virally infected cells can lead to and/or is a result of the concurrent maintenance in the levels of innate immune cells (Fig 1D) which can consequently give rise to varying levels of immunopathology (Fig 1E) . Finally, we tracked the immunopathology levels at the end of 30 days and observed that although the parameter dvm does not affect the immunopathology at lower values dmv, it has a non-monotonic relation at higher dmv values with intermediate values of dvm giving the least immunopathologic conditions (Fig 1F) . It is also important to note that although the final immunopathology at the end of 30 days shows a dip at intermediate values of dvm, such non-monotonic responses are not seen in the peak immunopathology value either in a twodimensional scan of kv-dmv or dmv-dvm (Fig S1G-H) . Put together, these observations suggest that initial innate immune response can drive varying outcomes in terms of viral clearance and immunopathology, with a possibility of viral persistence.",

We model this growth of adaptive immune cells in a logistic fashion but also dependent on the number of infected cells. Second, these adaptive immune cells can kill the infected cells at a rate of dcv. Third, the infected cells can induce exhaustion in the adaptive cell population, reducing the number of functionally active adaptive cells to kill the infected cells, through constant antigen accumulation, when present in overwhelmingly large numbers (32, 33) . Furthermore, adaptive immune cells (C) are also known to contribute to immunopathology (34, 35) , so we add a new contribution term kcp*C to the previous equation where kcp is the rate at which adaptive cells contribute to the immunopathology.

Thus, perturbing these dynamics can have a patient-specific response. We specifically considered two possible extreme cases: a very strong innate immune system but a very weak adaptive immune system and vice versa. In the \"non-severe\" case shown in Fig 2E, death rate of infected cells due to killing by the innate immune system (dmv) is 3 orders of magnitudes higher than that of the adaptive immune system (dcv), and vice versa in the case shown in Fig 2F. These differences cause some marked differences in the modes of clearance of infected cells from the system. As observed, the peak number of virally infected cells is far lower when the innate arm is stronger (Fig 2E) . This observation can be partly explained by the fact that the innate immune system is acting much earlier than the adaptive immune system. Interestingly, the viral clearance in both cases happens within 15 days, concordant with clinically observed data of viral clearance within 14 days in completely asymptomatic cases (36) .",

This difference can be partly explained by a slightly larger accumulation of innate immune cells, which contribute to immunopathology more than the adaptive immune cells, because the adaptive system kicks in much later as compared to innate immune system. This remnant immunopathology scenario (Fig 2F) may manifest as mild symptoms within the broad definition of \"non-severe\" cases, for instance in the form of fever, cough, and/or breathlessness, whereas the other scenario (Fig 2E) may be completely asymptomatic. As expected, the exhaustion of adaptive cell activity is higher in case of stronger adaptive response (Fig S2F) . While we have presented two extreme scenarios here as representative examples, in reality, there is likely a continuum of such phenotypes with varying degrees of contributions from the two arms in immune system that can give such \"non-severe\" phenotypes.

This lack of ability to resolve innate immune response and mount an efficient adaptive response is often an age-related change; this reason may at least in part explain higher susceptibility to the severe phenotype for elder population, ultimately leading to their death (37) .

Such patients might require admission into the ICU, but their outcome depends on the degree of immunopathology the body can handle. In excellent match with our model predictions, recent clinical data suggests that the COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU have a longer viral clearance time than the non-ICU patients: nearly 30 days vs. 12-16 days (39) .

Higher dmv value may lead to persistence of infection in the system, because the selfsuppression of innate immune system kicks in quite strongly which can further impede the clearance, unless higher values of dcv are brought in (compare Fig S3F with Fig S3A) . Thus, in the presence of strong self-suppression of innate immune system, a strong adaptive immune system seems to be necessary and sufficient to clear the infection. Consequently, in the subset of patients who have a relatively strong resolution capacity of the innate immune system, but a weaker adaptive system will tend to harbor a persistent population of the infection with moderate levels of immunopathology (Fig S3G) . Particularly for the scenario of relatively high values of dmv as compared to dcv for which the infection clearance happens in 15-20 days (Fig 3C) , a ten-fold increase in dvm renders the levels of virally infected cells to be oscillatory, albeit at lower load (approximately, 100 infected cells in the system) ( Fig  3G) . This phenotype gives intermediate values of the immunopathology (Fig 3H) , with innate and adaptive immune cell count kept in check (Fig S3H) . This phenotype may correspond to a subset of patients who are likely to have a prolonged stay at hospital (>30 days) but without overwhelmingly \"severe\" symptoms. Put together, these observations point towards the fact that optimal immune resolution responses are crucial in determining the \"severe\" clinical phenotype outcome in SARS-CoV-2 infections.",

In addition, under these conditions, the peak load of innate immune cells also reduced while having minimal changes in the peak values of adaptive immune cells (Fig 4B) . We next quantified the effect of drug treatment on these parameters by altering the time at which the antiviral therapy was introduced. We observed that there is a considerable reduction in the immunopathology peaks observed, with the maximum difference being caused for intervention time around 10 days, right after the infection peak (Fig 4C) ; this difference scaled with the efficacy of treatment introduced. However, there was significant lowering in the infection clearance times (Fig 4D) and the peak infected cell values, if the intervention was made earlier than 10 days (Fig S4A) . These results emphasises the fact that even though one were to reduce the viral load in the system by giving antivirals, it might not be sufficient to bring down the immunopathology related complications without the use of an additional drugs that alter immune activity.

However, the effect of antiviral treatment was more pronounced in the scenario of lower immunopathology scenario (Fig 3A) in terms of both peak viral load (FigS4D) and enabling faster clearance (Fig S4B) . Indeed, the peak of infected cell count does decrease with increasing drug efficacy, as kv directly affects the rise of infection levels. We see these effects diminishing as the intervention time reaches closer to the time taken for infected cells to reach the peak. These efforts, however, had little to no effect in reducing the immunopathology levels significantly (Fig S4C, S4E) . These results suggest that the antiviral drugs targeting the virulence of infection may not be equally effective in reducing immunopathology in all the \"severe\" phenotypes in COVID-19 patients. The impact of these drugs is likely to be maximal for the patients with a relatively weak adaptive and relatively strong innate immune system. This aspect also underscores the importance of using immune suppressants like IL-6 receptor antagonists to simultaneously decrease viral load and reduce immunopathology and facilitate tissue repair.",

In our model, we included a node representing such regulatory T cells that can be activated by the virally infected cells in an antigen-dependent manner (Fig 5A) . These regulatory cells can directly inhibit the function of innate (43) and adaptive (46) immune system largely via secreting IL-10 or TGF-\u03b2. We observed that parameter sets with robust viral clearance but high immunopathologic levels were now able to resolve the immunopathology with the introduction of the regulatory T cells without necessarily a change in the dynamics of virally infected cells (Fig 5B) but with a subsequent reduction in the innate immune cell levels in comparison to the control case (compare Fig S5A, S5B ). An extremely strong regulatory cell response can lead to over-suppression of the innate and the already impaired adaptive immune system (compare Fig S5C, S5D ) which may result in the resurgence of the infection (Fig 5C) . Furthermore, a strong immune suppression of both the arms of the immune responses by the regulatory cells causes an apparent clearance of the virus but the virus can persist at very low levels until the immune cells are suppressed enough (compare Fig S5E, Fig S5F) for the resurgence of the virus (Fig 5D) . This scenario of immuno-compromised state can allow other opportunistic pathogens to infect the lungs (47) , thus further complicating the situation. These analyses suggest that although the regulatory T cells have the capability of resolving cytokine mediated immunopathology, overactivation of the same can enhance non-clearance of the virus and facilitate other infections.",

We have developed a minimalistic yet rigorous mathematical model that encapsulates the interactions between the virally infected cells and the innate and adaptive immune systems to observe the various clinically observed phenotypes emerge as a result of the dynamics of the system. This mathematical model uncovers the existence of distinct phenotypes and parametric combinations that enable them. Thus, we uncover the delicate balance that exists between viral clearance, immunopathology and resolution of inflammation and how the various combinations of these give rise to some of the observed phenotypes.",

            "text": "Our model, within biologically reasonable parameter ranges, closely mimics some of the observed clinical patterns. First, our model closely follows the observed trends of viral loads peaking around 5-6 days after symptom onset (60) . In our model, virally infected cells which act as a proxy for viral load in the respiratory system of a patient peak around 2-10 days. Second, the peak of infected cells in severe vs. non-severe (mild/asymptomatic) phenotypes in our model does not differ largely, reminiscent of clinical observations that the observed viral load is similar for symptomatic vs. asymptomatic patients (8) . Third, our model predicts that patients with higher immunopathology values are associated with longer infection clearance times, a prediction that is validated by recent clinical data suggesting that COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU tend to take twice the clearance time compared to the non-ICU patients (30 days vs. 14 days) (39) . Fourth, we demonstrate that the impaired ability of innate immune system to resolve the inflammation can drive cytokine-induced immunopathology; indeed, \"being stuck in immune response\" can be a hallmark of severe disease and possibly the death of the patient (37) . Similar observations have been made for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (61); for instance, patients who died of SARS had higher levels of pulmonary pro-inflammatory cytokines (62) . Thus, while our model is relatively coarsegrained and clubs many innate and adaptive innate immune systems into one variable each, it is capable of recapitulating various clinicopathological features for COVID-19 patients reported so far.",

While the viral entry mechanisms may be similar for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, the similarities and differences in impact of internalized virus on intracellular signaling in infected cells seems to be yet identified. Interestingly, SARS-CoV was shown to be able to suppress the interferon response through viral proteins, hence overcoming one of the first lines of defense of the body (63) (64) (65) . Preliminary evidence suggests that the SARS-CoV-2 can induce a robust expression of interferon pathway related genes (12, 66) . However, the degree of interferon response elicited by individual patients can vary. Our model parameter k v can capture variability in this feature, and can be incorporated as a function of underlying signaling pathways that drive this variability, such as NF-kB signaling (67, 68) .",

Such crosstalk, once discovered, can be incorporated in the model. Given the diverse clinical phenotypes observed, we will likely need to design different therapeutic regimens. A recent study showed that in a cohort of 100 patients with hyperinflammatory syndrome, Tocilizumab, a monoclonal antibody that targets the IL6 receptor, can improve or stabilize the condition in about 77% of the cases, whereas the condition worsened in remaining 23% (69) . This difference also points to the fact that in cases of hyperinflammatory cases which lack inflammation resolution strength, it might not be enough to give anti-virals only; instead, immune suppressants become a must as a combination therapy. However, such a therapy is likely to fail in phenotypes where there is a strong resolution of inflammation, leading to viral persistence. Thus, our model can serve as a decision-making and predictive framework in such situations where one needs to distinguish between different possible phenotypes and develop mechanistic drug combinations and optimize intervention time of these combinations.",
