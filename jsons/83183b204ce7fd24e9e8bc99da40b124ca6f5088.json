The amoebae are characterized on the basis of light and electron microscopy with special emphasis on the structure of the basket scales, which have species-specific architecture. The two new species are the second and third ones recovered from environments other than freshwater. In terms of scale morphology they most closely resemble a freshwater species, Korotnevella bulla (Schaeffer, 1926 ) Goodkov, 1988 . Two genus names, Dactylamoeba Korotnev, I880 and Korotnevellu Goodkov, 1988, are in current use. The latter name is preferred, pending rediscovery and characterization of Dactylamoeba elongafu Korotnev, 1880, the type species of the genus. Korotnevella species can be divided into three groups on the basis of scale morphology, suggesting that the genus may not be monophyletic. A key to species is provided.",

Four species have been recognized, all but one of which are from freshwater environments (Smirnov 1999) . Species diversity, taxonomic boundaries, and phylogenetic relationships are not well understood. For example, species with several different scale types are included in the genus. The genus name is itself controversial, since both Korotnevellu and Dactylamoeba Korotnev, 1880 , have been used in recent publications to refer to the same organisms (Butler and Rogerson 1997; Page 1983 Page , 1988 Page , 1991 Smirnov 1996 Smirnov -1997 Smirnov , 1999 .",

One arm of the Y determined the direction of movement while the other moved posteriorly and could be resorbed (Fig. 3) .

When this happened, the direction of movement was usually shifted approximately 90\". In cultures with high bacterial densities, attached cells often produced a single, long, unattached fingerlike pseudopodium (dactylopodium; Page 1981), as long as or longer than the main body mass.

At that time, Mayorella bigemma (Schaeffer, 1918) Schaeffer, 1926, the type species of the genus, had not been examined by electron microscopy, and Page (1981) opined thai it could not be cuticulate. Also at that time, Page ( I98 1) noted that Dactylamoeba Korotnev, 1880, was indistinguishable on the basis of published light microscopical characters from Mayorella. To avoid replacing a well-known name with an obscure but older one, Page (1981 Page ( , 1982 proposed to conserve Mayorella over Dactylamoeba. This proposal was accepted (Melville 1985) .",

Since knowledge of the diversity of gymnamoebae in general, and scale-covered gymnamoebae in particular, is inadequate, the inclusion of dactylopodiate, scale-bearing, parasome-free species in a single genus, Korotnevella, has had a certain conservative logic. However, with the addition of K. hemi.stylo1epi.s and K. monacantholepis to Group 1 of the genus, the \"outlier\" status of K. nivo and K. diskophora (Group 2 and Group 3 in Table  1 ) is accentuated. Both of the outlier species have just one scale type, and the morphology of these scales has little i n common with those of Group I Korotnevellti. N o other features of K. nivo and K. diskophoru are diagnostic for Korotnevella. For example, dactylopodia and the single, large, perinuclear Golgi body are characteristics common to most M N Jorella-like amoebae, not just species of Korotnei~ella.",
