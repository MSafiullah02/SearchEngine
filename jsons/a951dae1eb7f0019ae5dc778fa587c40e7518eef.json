Then also lethality rate 171for the whole of France was calculated but excluding areas that have been under 172hospital stress (Ile-de-France and Grand-Est). This was done in order to evaluate 173hospital case-fatality rates per age group independently of possible excess mortality 174due to the saturation of healthcare systems in certain districts.Classically, (number 175 of deaths expected in district ) is the sum over the different age groups of the district's 176 population in the age group multiplied by the hospital case-fatality rate of the age where is the population of the age group \"a\" and is the hospital case-fatality 180 rate of the age group calculated over all districts. 181 Standardized case-fatality rate The Standardized Lethality Ratio (SLR) is equal to the ratio between the observed 183 death toll and the expected death toll . The standardized hospital case-fatality 184 rate for each district is equal to the average rate for France multiplied by the 185 district's SLR. The significance of the SLR (H0: SLR=1, no statistically significant over 186 -or under-fatality compared to the expected value) is evaluated for each district by a 187 Breslow & Day test [SOU 19] in order to account for the statistical significance of the 188differences in these ratios between districts.

This situation could be due to a medical policy of more active screening and 356 earlier hospitalization of the infected in the district, particularly in Marseille metropolitan 357 area. The high value of the hospitalization rate would then be more the result of a non-358 severe treatment of the infected than of a more active circulation of the virus in the 359 region, as for the lower hospitalization rates in neighboring districts (0.9 for Var, 0.56 360 for Vaucluse, 0.52 for Gars, 0.86 for Alpes-de-Haute-Provence, 0.81 for Alpes-361 Maritimes, 0.68 for H\u00e9rault). However, patient severity profile (expressed as the ratio 362 between the number of patients admitted to intensive care and the total number of 363 patients hospitalized) is not particularly low in the Bouches-Du-Rh\u00f4ne (0.163 for a 364 mean of 0.156 and a standard deviation of 0.06 for all the districts), and this 365 hospitalization policy is therefore not proven to be the primary factor in the low 366 observed case-fatality rate. 367 Time analysis shows that the case-fatality rate has decreased over time, globally 368 and in almost all districts, showing an improvement in the management of severe 369 patients during the epidemic. This decrease stabilized rapidly and no longer evolved 370 in a steady manner. However, this result is limited by the difficulty of calculating a case-371 fatality rate on aggregated data over a short period of time, with eventual death 372 occurring several days after hospitalization. We chose to delay the calculation of the 373 number of deaths by 12 days compared to the calculation of the number of 374 hospitalizations, since 85% of deaths occur on an average of 13 days after 375 hospitalization [SAL 20]. 376 WHO data from 219 countries (WHO 20) show a mean case-fatality rate of 0.041 377 (median 0.029, standard deviation 0.045) with values between 0.31 (Nicaragua) and 378 0.00 (for countries that did not report deaths, like Vietnam).
