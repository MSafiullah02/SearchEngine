            "text": "RNA interference (RNAi) is a normal physiological mechanism for RNA-guided regulation of gene expression, common in all higher eukaryotes (1). In this pathway, double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) silences the expression of genes with sequences that are complementary to the antisense strand of the dsRNA (2). In one therapeutic approach to harness the power of RNAi, a class of synthetic dsRNAs, known as siRNA (short or small interfering RNA), is used (3, 4). The siRNA is 21\u201323 nucleotides long and may be designed to contain 2-nt long 3\u2032 extensions. The antisense strand (also called \u201cguide strand\u201d) of the siRNA engages into a multiprotein RNAi-induced silencing complex (RISC). A catalytic component of RISC, Argonaute-2, then specifically cleaves the target RNA strand within RISC, thus destroying the target (2). Clearly, RNAi offers high specificity and efficacy in turning off the expression of target genes.",

RSV is a nonsegmented single-stranded RNA virus of the Paramyxoviridae family. In addition to RSV, a number of serious and life-threatening human and domestic animal viruses (e.g., mumps, measles, parainfluenza, borna, rabies, ebola, Hendra and Nipah) belong to this family (6). Of note, the influenza (Flu) virus, belonging to the Orthomyxoviridae family, is also an RNA virus but contains a segmented genome. Thus, an intranasal RNAi approach can also be effective against all respiratory viral diseases (7, 8), including Flu (9) and SARS (10).",

            "text": "\nIt is assumed that the reader has expertise in designing siRNA against a given target. We generally follow the design suite offered by the Dharmacon (Thermo Scientific) and the Whitehead Institute (MIT, Cambridge, MA) web pages. We also try to avoid the relatively strong immunogenic sequence: 5\u2032GUCCUUCAA3\u2032 (11).Essentially all RNA viral genes are essential for robust virus growth, and hence the siRNA designed against any viral mRNA will inhibit virus replication. Nonetheless, we generally target components of the viral RNA synthesis machinery; for Paramyxoviridae, they are: L (Large protein; RNA-dependent RNA polymerase), P (Phosphoprotein; a transcription factor for L), and N (Nucleocapsid protein; essential for the template function of the viral genomic RNA).For reasons of animal ethics and cost-saving, we always test a new siRNA sequence in cell culture for antiviral potency by measuring the progeny viral titer. Use a range of concentrations from 2 to 200 nM; a potent siRNA should exhibit 90% inhibition at low nM concentrations (e.g., at a concentration below 20 nM). With this criteria and using the design recommendations in Note 1, we have experienced a success rate of 80% (8 out of 10 siRNAs) over the years.Steps in Subheading 3.1 are not needed if fully deprotected, annealed, ready-to-use siRNA is purchased commercially, which are more expensive. To save cost, we usually purchase 2\u2032-ACE protected RNA and deprotect it. The 2\u2032-ACE modification increases stability of the RNA during shipment and storage.We have described a simple method of nasal delivery of siRNA in the mouse model, but it can be successfully scaled up or down to use in other laboratory animals.To diminish any possible toxic effect of delivery reagents, siRNA can be introduced \u201cnaked,\u201d i.e., without transfection reagent, which exhibits about 70\u201380% activity of the reagent-complexed siRNA. It is best not to use polyethyleneimine (PEI). Although PEI is often used to form complexes with nucleic acids, mice do not tolerate PEI through the nose, although delivery through other avenues, such as intravenous, are well tolerated. In our attempts, essentially all mice died within minutes of inhalation of PEI-siRNA complex. New generation of transfection reagents are constantly being reported (12, 13) that may provide better delivery.Administration of excessive liquid will \u201cdrown\u201d the mouse and cause death. Try to keep the total volume under 45 \u03bcL in routine application although up to 100 \u03bcL may be tolerated.The intranasal procedure also works in an aerosolized application. We have used small homemade enclosures in which the anesthetized mouse is placed and the siRNA complex (made as in Subheading 3.2) is sprayed by a hand-held nebulizer (the common type used as an inhaler by asthmatics). In this method, however, a larger amount of siRNA is needed because most of the mist gets wasted and only a small fraction is inhaled by the animal. To optimize cost vs. benefit, it is recommended that various amounts of mist and duration of exposure is tested and optimized for a given enclosure volume. If this method is to be routinely used, a commercial motorized nebulizer can be easily optimized. It is recommended to check with the local pediatric department for the exact model, vendor, and usage. Modify the system by removing the plastic face cup (or mask) at the delivery end and insert the tube directly into the mouse enclosure. Reagent cost can be reduced by designing a smaller face cup to snugly fit the mouse nose area.\n",
