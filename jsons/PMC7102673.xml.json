A more precise definition is a large number of people attending an event that is focused on specific sites for a finite time. As a consequence, Mass Gathering Medicine has emerged as a new field in the medical and health service specialty that focuses on the health risks due to mass gatherings [2], [3], [4]. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines it as \u201cevents attended by a sufficient number of people to strain the planning and response resources of a community, state or nation\u201d[5].",

Considered to be one of the largest mass gatherings of its kind, the Hajj pilgrimage faces health challenges. Pilgrims (Hajjis) come from different parts of the world and present diverse socio-demographic characteristics and health backgrounds. These factors result in the manifestation of many health risks to pilgrims and subject them to communicable diseases, injuries, and loss of thousands of lives while attending these large events [9].

Moreover, outbreaks of infectious diseases, particularly acute respiratory tract infections, diarrheal diseases, and meningococcal meningitis, have frequently been reported among Hajjis [12]. Given that the average Hajj journey ranges between 30 to 45 days, the majority of pilgrims will most likely be at risk for contracting an illness. This pilgrimage consists of a stay of approximately 6 days in Jeddah city, which is the entry point to Saudi Arabia in preparation for the arranged events. Followed by approximately 10 days of special prayers in the city of Madinah. After that, approximately 8 days are spent in Makkah performing important tasks, and, finally, the remainder of the period is spent preparing to return to the starting location [13].",

In our study, the male-to-female ratio was 3:1, which is in agreement with many studies that showed that a pneumococcal infection is more frequent in males. It may also be explained by the fact that annually more male pilgrims perform Hajj than female pilgrims. In addition, the mean age was 56.8 years (range 48\u221264). This may be because the regulations of the Hajj in most Islamic countries prioritize Hajj performance among individuals older than 40 years. Elderly pilgrims are more susceptible to infections due to overexertion, limited sleep and rest; disturbance of dietary schedule and types of food; and the inability to maintain serious medical complications due to decreased immune function.
