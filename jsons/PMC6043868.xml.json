            "text": "West Nile Virus (WNV) belongs to Flaviviridae family which shows the close association with dengue virus. WNV is transmitted by mosquito and causes febrile illness upon infection that further develops encephalitis including flaccid paralysis and cognitive dysfunction (Ceausu et al., 1997; Petersen and Marfin, 2002; Sejvar et al., 2003). Birds are the main target of WNV encephalitis but other vertebrates including humans are also at the edge of high risk. WNV fever and encephalitis have become prevalent throughout the world including the Middle East, Europe, Africa and America since the mid-1990s (Hubalek and Halouzka, 1999; Lanciotti et al., 1999; Petersen et al., 2003; Dauphin et al., 2004; Hayes et al., 2005; Mattar et al., 2005; Deardorff et al., 2006; Komar and Clark, 2006). The symptoms of WNV are more prevalent in elderly and immuno-compromised person although patients might be affected in any stages of age. The survey reported that fatality rate of most recent WNV outbreak is about 4\u201314% but it might be increased from 10 to 19% in hospitalized cases (Mattar et al., 2005). However, despite WNV's worldwide distribution and epidemic nature, currently, no effective medication is available that can prevent or cure this infection. Therefore, the patients with WNV infection were likely to have supportive treatment such as mosquito net usage, intensive nursing care, painkiller administration etc. (Hayes and Gubler, 2006; Division of Vector-Borne Infectious Disease, 2007).",

            "text": "The enveloped virion (50 nm) of WNV is comprised of RNA genome surrounded by a lipid bilayer membrane. The secondary structure of envelope protein (E) plays a vital role in translation, RNA synthesis, and packaging (Shi et al., 1996; Khromykh et al., 2001; Granwehr et al., 2004; Busch et al., 2005; Friebe and Harris, 2019). The envelope glycoproteins (E) intercede viral attachment and their entry by membrane fusion (Kanai et al., 2006). The domain of E protein is important for eliciting neutralizing antibodies as it is exposed on the viral surface. The envelope E glycoprotein is the foremost antigen which is also the essential target for vaccine development (Roehrig, 2003). The envelope (E) protein selected for drug design plays a crucial role in translation, RNA synthesis and packaging. We have selected a potential inhibitor AP30451 (experimentally validated from 80000 chemical compounds) which inhibits the translation and replication of WNV. The compound AP30451 inhibited translation of WNV mRNA and blocked WNV replication upon inhibitor screening of WNV replicon and Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) of several cell types (Noueiry et al., 2007). And we have designed some inhibitor compounds from parent molecules AP30451. As E protein is essential for translation, it is, therefore, to be selected an inhibitor AP30451 which will ultimately inhibit the translation mechanism of WNV. The structural (capsid, envelope, and pre-membrane) and nonstructural (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5) proteins were found during translation of viral RNA (Lindenbach et al., 2007). Receptor interaction, membrane fusion, and virion assembly are regulated by the envelope (E) protein. The conformation of E protein during virion assembly and premature fusion of it during virus exocytosis to the cell surface are both stabilized by the pre-membrane (prM) (Westaway et al., 2002). prM is cleaved to M (infectious virions that are released by exocytosis) via a furin mediated pathway upon the transportation through the trans-Golgi network (Guirakhoo et al., 1991; Elshuber et al., 2003).",

            "text": "The approach of vaccinomics which is integrated with bioinformatics tools has been better choice for the recent development of new vaccines (Flower, 2008; Poland et al., 2009). To emphasize this, here we propose an integrated approach, relying on vaccine development and drug prediction against WNV. Vaccinomics already demonstrated its potentials against some life-threatening diseases such as multiple sclerosis (Bourdette et al., 2005) malaria (L\u00f3pez et al., 2001) and tumors (Knutson et al., 2001) through the development of the vaccine. An ideal vaccine that prompts immunity should essentially be able to eliminate the risk of re-infection as well as to elicit a specific immunological response (Atanas and Irini, 2013). In this perspective, immune dominant B-Cell and T-cell epitopes mapping is the prime concern of immunoinformatics based research to reduce expenses and valuable time for the development of vaccines. The chronic symptoms which may last for months to years might require being treated with the vaccine and drug simultaneously. Moreover, a mutation could shrink the effectiveness of the vaccine/drug candidates against the viral disease. Therefore, concurrent development of vaccine and drug candidates against viral disease might be the interest of the researchers and clinicians. To emphasize this, we have added both vaccine and drug therapy approach in the same study. Still, vaccination might be ineffective due to the emergence of a sudden outbreak of WNV. Post-therapeutics or drugs could be the best option until the new vaccine is developed. Here, we employ an integrated approach relying on both vaccine and drug development against WNV. Computer -aided screening techniques and docking simulation could significantly contribute to determine suitable inhibitors to the target proteins and to find out exclusive binding sites of potential target proteins respectively. Inhibitor molecules for dengue virus, envelope protein have recently been successfully identified based on this assumption methodology (Yennamalli et al., 2009). The approach of bioinformatics in the field of vaccine and drug discovery has already prolifically performed against some virus and bacteria (Sharmin and Islam, 2014; Hasan et al., 2015; Khan et al., 2015; Oany et al., 2015; Hossain et al., 2016a,b,c). Therefore, we have analyzed WNV entire proteome and identified its potential immunogenic regions. Further, computational methods have been performed for the prediction of inhibitor molecules against the active site of the target protein. This in silico research has been steered to design effective peptide vaccine and some novel drugs for the better medication system that could lead the possible treatment as well as prevention of WNV infection.",

The threshold for antigenicity in the conserved region was 1.00 whereas all values >1.00 from the result considered as potential antigenic determinants. We identified an epitope that meets the threshold criteria with the potentiality to initiate B cell response Figure 4A. Among others, we have found a region of amino acid residues (176\u2013184) as surface accessibility to be urged for potential B cell epitope Figure 4B. The antigenic region of a protein generally contains beta turns which are usually surface accessible and exhibit hydrophilic nature. The region 107\u2013115, 176\u2013184, and 230\u2013238 were reported as the \u03b2-turns region from Chou and Fasman Beta-turn prediction Figure 4C. It is speculated that the flexibility of the peptide has a strong correlation with antigenicity (Doytchinova and Flower, 2007). Karplus and Schulz flexibility prediction tool suggested the region of 176\u2013184 as most flexible Figure 4D. Finally, we implemented the Bepipred linear epitope prediction tool to identify the region which could be predicted as the linear B-cell epitope Figures 4E, 5. To confirm the hydrophilic nature of a peptide region, Parker Hydrophilicity was also employed in the region. To analyze the all data from B-cell epitope prediction tools, the conserved sequence \u201cITPSAPSYT\u201d of 176\u2013184 region was shown to be able to prompt the immunity as B-cell epitope.",

The infection of WNV is one of the emerging diseases and fatalities in humans and livestock around the globe. A few WNV vaccines in the pipeline provided a proof of concept for veterinary use. Still efforts on the development of effective therapeutics for human remain unsuccessful partly due to wet lab approaches which couldn't allow the faster method. However, the recent development of immunopharmacology tools together with the understanding of structure and function of WNV proteins could provide a faster and stronger platform for designing and developing vaccines/drugs as potential therapeutics. In the current study, we have been able to retrieve, store and utilize a lot of information about genomics and proteomics of WNV virus made available by the sequence-based technology which in turn allowed us the identification of epitopes from antigenic protein. The designing of epitope-based peptide vaccine against WNV achieved through the identification of a neutralizing epitope using similar bioinformatics tools applied for the recently recommended epitope-based vaccines such as dengue, chikungunya etc (Lapelosa et al., 2009; Chakraborty et al., 2010; Islam et al., 2012; Hasan et al., 2013; Hossain et al., 2018).",

To suggest both B-cell and T-cell epitopes from the most antigenic protein we have used different bioinformatics tools to confer the immunity in WNV. A well-conserved T cell epitopes among the envelope glycoprotein sequences of WNV were considered as strong and potent. Our predicted human non-allergen T-cell epitope \u201cKSFLVHREW\u201d is expected to be effective as peptide vaccine as well as provide the protection broadly against various strains due to its higher binding affinity to interact highest numbers (13) of HLA and very high conservancy (82.46%) respectively Tables 1, 2, and Figure 6. This higher binding affinity of this epitope to MHC allele was confirmed by docking analysis by using a specific allele Figure 4. HLA alleles responsible for exposing affinity to KSFLVHREW were investigated for population coverage in WNV endemic regions. The significant level of population coverage was achieved for European, Asian and American population Figure 3. According to these results, it is obvious that this non-allergen vaccine would be effective for a vast population throughout a wide geographical region Figure 3. Through rigorous analysis of several characteristics such as the presence of antigenicity, beta-turns, flexibility, accessibility, linearity and hydrophilicity, this study also predicted, identified and confirmed a potent B-cell epitope \u201cITPSAPSYT\u201d from WNV envelope glycoprotein Figures 5, 6. In addition to an effective vaccine, a universal drug is required for the minimization or complete elimination of chronic symptoms caused by the infection which may last for months to years. Further, sometimes the action of vaccine might not be effective due to acquired mutational change. Then the treatment with drugs could be the best choice against WNV. Nevertheless, vaccination won't be effective in the worst case of sudden WNV outbreak. Therefore, we have also identified the active sites of the highest antigenic protein of WNV for proposing some novel inhibitors alongside with pre-therapeutic vaccine design. Drug designing against WNV was based on the highest antigenic protein from its proteome, the envelope glycoprotein. Before designing the inhibitor, we have predicted the 3D model of the target glycoprotein based on a PSI blast identified model template 3P54_A and confirmed its superior quality Supplementary Figures S1\u2013S4. We have designed four WNV inhibitors from a control WNV inhibitor AP30451 which upon structural stability analysis indicated their candidature as drugs Figures 7, 8. It is clearly apparent that all the designed molecules are the most potent inhibitors as they have lowest docking energy indicating their higher binding affinity to the envelope glycoprotein. Further, they interacted with active pocket amino acid Thr-26, Trp-27, and Val-193 of envelope glycoprotein Tables 3, 4 and Figures 9, 10. Besides, the mode of action of designed and control inhibitors was found similar when they were assessed for their pharmacological properties Table 5. Poor metabolism or toxic effect might urge to fail a drug compound in phase III clinical trials (Ju et al., 2011). The fundamental characteristics of the establishment of drugs are to measure their pharmacophore properties. The advancement of bioinformatics software could be employed to predict these properties before the wet lab confirmation (Ekins et al., 2007). Among the ADMET properties, all the designed molecules showed similar human intestinal absorption rate, higher metabolic rate, no sign to cross blood-brain barrier and balanced volume of drug distribution into the body. Furthermore, the toxic level of these compounds seems to be standard than the parent compound. Also the higher drug likeness of our designed compounds 1(0.45), 2(0.31), 3(0.14), and 4(0.41) over the experimentally validated control compounds AP30451 (0.05) support their effectiveness as inhibitory agents of the envelope glycoprotein of WNV Figure 12 and Table 5.",
