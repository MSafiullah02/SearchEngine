In the absence of effective drugs and vaccines for SARS, rapid identification of this disease is of importance for controlling spread. At present, virus isolation by cell culture, ELISA, IFA and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) are the major methods to diagnose SARS. ELISA and IFA methods depend on the detection of IgG and/or IgM against SARS-CoV virus that emerged in the blood during the later phase of infection (Ksiazek et al., 2003, Drosten et al., 2003). There is a critical need for a test that can detect SARS at early stages of illness (days 1\u20133) since persons infected with the SARS-CoV can infect a large number of individuals easily (Rosling and Rosling, 2003). The detection of viral RNA with RT-PCR assays is the most widely used approach for early detection of pathogens (Drosten et al., 2003, Poon et al., 2003). Based on the genomic sequence of BJ01 (accession number: AY278488), 12 sets of nested primers covering SARS-CoV have been synthesized. In this study a methodology for selecting the no. 73 nested primers as the most promising primers for clinical purposes and a Taqman RT-nested PCR system using the no. 73 nested primer set are described, and the system was evaluated on a test panel.",

With the 10-fold diluted BJ01 genome RNA series, the reverse transcriptions were carried out separately with a random primer and a specific primer. Then, amplification with outer primer on the cDNA was performed. The products were monitored with SYBR Green I that binds with double DNA. The results showed that three out of seven sets of nested primers have better efficiency on templates reverse transcribed with the specific primer, and three other sets of primers showed that the reverse transcription with the random primer has higher efficiency than with the specific primer. It is worthy to note that the four sets of nested primers located on the terminus of the genome have higher efficiency when transcribed with the random primer. In contrast, the other three sets of primers targeting the initial region of genome have higher efficiency when transcribed with the specific primer. The outer reverse primer pairs of no. 73 are the most sensitive on cDNA reverse transcribed with specific primer. Meanwhile, the no. 80 primers can attain the same sensitivity on the cDNA reverse transcribed with the random primers (Fig. 3\n).",

To test the specificity of the Taqman RT-nested PCR system, a panel consisting of 30 sets of RNA from SARS patients\u2019 whole blood and 9 sets of RNA from control person\u2019s whole blood was used. These RNA samples were reverse transcribed with the no. 73 outer reverse primer. After the first round of PCR, a second round of PCR was performed and monitored with real time PCR. None of the control samples produced a signal, whereas, 25 of the 30 samples from SARS patients produced a detectable signal.

The spike (S) protein, together with the E and M proteins, constitute the components of the surface of coronaviruses. The replicase (R) protein, which occurs in limited amounts, including 1a and 1b is the defined unique non-structural protein responsible for RNA replication. According to the Northern blot, the subgenomic regions for S, M, and E are transcribed in larger quantities (Rota et al., 2003). With the 10-fold diluted RNA as template, the sensitivity of primers targeting the S, M, E, and N proteins is higher than 10\u2013100-fold than those primers targeting the R protein, which suggests that the sensitivity of detection is determined mostly by the quantity of transcripts.",

The primer is the primary component necessary for developing RT-nested PCR. The size of outer amplicon was set range from 200 to 280 bp, which were usually sufficiently long to design inner primers with spacing intervals of \u223c100 bp. Compared with longer PCR products, this range and flexibility enables many assays to be produced successfully. For these primers, the reverse transcriptions with random primer and specific primer have different effects. According to the sensitivity and simplicity of our test result, the no. 73 primer appears to be the most promising primers set for clinical diagnosis, which is very useful to simplify the detection process through combining RT and first round of PCR reactions to one-step RT-PCR reaction.",

The product can be confirmed as SARS-CoV by a number of other methods including Taqman, DNA chip, PCR\u2013ELISA, and sequencing. In this study, the Taqman probe was applied to confirm the PCR product. The Taqman system was developed by ABI and employs a fluoregenic probe-based 5\u2032, exonuclease technology that enables amplification and detection to be carried out simultaneously, eliminating the need for post-PCR analysis (Heid et al., 1996, Fortin et al., 2001). Use of the fluorescent probe in real time PCR provides an additional level of assay specificity. Although fluorescence increases in direct proportion to the amount of specific amplicons, the Taqman probe was used to specify the product in this study because the fluorescence increases non-linearly in the second round of amplification compared with the original virus RNA concentration. To confirm positive amplicon, the PCR procedure should include appropriate negative and positive controls in each run, including negative and positive controls for the extraction procedure and the PCR run.",

High concentration of viral RNA of up to 100 million molecules per milliliter has been detected in sputum. Viral RNA has also been detected at extremely low concentrations in plasma during the acute illness phase and in feces during the late convalescent phase, suggesting that the SARS-CoV may be shed in feces for prolonged periods of time (Drosten et al., 2003). Compared with sputum and feces, blood is used more frequently in clinical practice because it is relatively easy to obtain. In this study, whole blood was therefore used as test sample in order to develop a clinically useful detection method for the early stage of infection. According to the protocol developed in the study, the sensitivity and specificity of the Taqman RT-nested PCR system are 83 and 100%, respectively. Negative results cannot exclude the existence of SARS-CoV in tested samples, which may be attributed to low amounts of RNA in the samples.
