Several authors outlined different 2D graphical representations of DNA sequences based on two dimensional Cartesian coordinates. The original plot of a DNA sequence as a random walk on a 2D grid using the four cardinal directions to represent the four bases was done by Gates 2, Leong and Morgenthaler 3, and Nandy 4. Their method is based on the assignment of the four bases of DNA sequences to the four directions of the (x, y) coordinate system. These 2D graphical representations of DNA sequence provide useful insights into local and global characteristics and the occurrences, variations and repetition of the nucleotides along a sequence that are not easily observed from DNA sequences directly. However, these graphical representations are accompanied with some loss of information because of overlapping and crossing of the curve representing DNA with itself. To eliminate, or at least reduce the degeneracy of the above graphical representations, many high orders and unique graphical representations have been proposed 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11.",

In particular, the leading eigenvalues of the L/L matrices have been considered to be good descriptors of DNA sequences. However, the computation of the leading eigenvalues of the L/L matrices for long DNA sequences will be expensive. Therefore, the emergence of research into mathematical descriptors of DNA sequences is apparent and necessary.",

Based on the 3D graphical representation, we calculated curvature and torsion in difference forms. Then, the curvature and torsion are regarded as the new descriptor to numerically characterize the DNA sequences. Avoiding the complexity of calculating the leading eigenvalues of the matrix for graphical representation, our method is more simple. Its application to the similarity/dissimilarity of the coding sequences of \u03b2\u2010globin gene of 11 species and each of the exons of the gene illustrates validity. Not only so, using our method we analyzed coronavirus genomes and constructed the phylogenetic tree. The result, that is consistent with previous analysis, shows that SARS\u2010CoVs form an independent group.",
