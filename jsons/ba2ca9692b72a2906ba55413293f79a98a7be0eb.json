            "text": "Purpose: Previous studies have outlined mechanisms by which Mycoplasma pneumonia (M. pneumonia) infection may promote allergic lung inflammation and airway remodeling, and increasing evidence from human studies suggests that atypical bacterial infections contribute to asthma exacerbation, chronic asthma, and disease severity with changes in cytokine expression. The present study evaluated changes in serum levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and interleukin (IL)-5 in atopic children with Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia. Methods: We recruited a total of 72 children with pneumonia. The patients were divided into 4 groups: atopic children with M. pneumonia pneumonia (group I, n=24), nonatopic children with M. pneumonia pneumonia (group II, n=23), atopic children with viral pneumonia (group III, n=13), and non-atopic children with viral pneumonia (group IV, n=12). Serum levels of IL-5, IL-13, VEGF, and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 were measured at admission and at recovery using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Results: Serum levels of VEGF and IL-5 were elevated in group I compared with the other groups at both admission phase and clinical recovery phase. In group I, serum levels of VEGF and IL-5 were higher at recovery phase than at admission phase (VEGF: 1,102.2\u00b1569.4 vs. 874.9\u00b1589.9 pg/mL, respectively; IL-5: 150.5\u00b163.9 vs. 120.2\u00b146.7 pg/mL, respectively). Conclusions: The serum levels of VEGF and IL-5 were more increased in atopic children with M. pneumonia pneumonia than in the other groups. In this group, the serum levels of VEGF and IL-5 were more increased at recovery phase than at admission phase. The results of this study suggest that increases in VEGF and IL-5 may contribute to the development of hypersensitivity during M. pneumonia infection. These cytokines may act through their respective pro-inflammatory pathways to aggravate the allergic status and induce airway hypersensitivity during M. pneumonia pneumonia in atopic children.",

            "text": "panied by M. pneumoniae infection, compared with those without. This observation suggests that M. pneumoniae infection is related to asthma attacks. Further studies analyzing the expression of various cytokines are needed to understand the relationship between M. pneumoniae infection and asthma. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a major mediator that induces airway hypersensitivity to inhalant allergens. VEGF is secreted from endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells as well as inflammatory cells upon inflammatory reactions. It induces angiogenesis, permeability changes, and edehttp://e-aair.org ma formation in the airway wall; all of these play crucial roles in the pathophysiology of asthma. Hypersecretion of VEGF in the airways induces T cell sensitization to inhalant allergens and stimulates the synthesis of co-stimulatory molecules in lungresident dendritic cells. 8 A previous study has indicated that serum VEGF levels are significantly higher in M. pneumoniae infected-patients with wheezing than in those without wheezing. 9 Interleukin (IL)-5 is primarily secreted by Th2 cells and is related to the growth, maturation, differentiation, survival, and activation of eosinophils. Eosinophils accumulate in the lungs of transgenic mice that overexpress IL-5. 10, 11 Moreover, IL-5 plays a role in the development of asthma. Choi et al. 12 have demonstrated that serum levels of VEGF and IL-5 are significantly higher in atopic patients with wheezing than in those without or in control subjects. IL-13, which plays a role in airway remodeling, induces tissue fibrosis through transforming growth factor-\u03b2 activation. 13 In addition, IL-13 has been shown to induce myofibroblast hyperplasia, airway obstruction, and airway hyperresponsiveness. 9 In in vitro experiments, Thavagnanam et al. 14 showed that IL-13 enhances goblet cell hyperplasia and decreases the number of bronchial epithelial cells detected in samples taken from children, suggesting an IL-13-mediated mechanism for the development of asthma. Interferon (IFN)-\u03b3 is released by Th1 cells and suppresses Th2 cells, thus maintaining the balance between Th1 and Th2 cells. Stirling and Chung 15 have advocated that serum IFN-\u03b3 levels are decreased in atopic patients and that there is a significant relationship between the decrease in IFN-\u03b3 and the severity of asthma. Lack et al. 16 reported that IL-5 levels and the number of eosinophils are both decreased in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid after intrathecal administration of IFN-\u03b3. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 increases airway responsiveness and promotes the synthesis of various cytokines such as regulated upon activation, normal T-cell expressed and secreted, IL-8, and granulocyte-macrophage stimulating factor, which in turn initiate chronic airway inflammation. 15 This study was conducted to investigate the effect of Mycoplasma infection on allergic diseases by measuring the serum levels of VEGF, IL-5, IL-13, IFN-\u03b3, and TNF-\u03b1.",

Our findings, which included atopic children with and without wheezing, are consistent with those of previous studies that included children with wheezing. 9, 12 It has been suggested that compared with allergy, M. pneumoniae can more frequently aggravate or initiate asthma symptoms, and that M. pneumoniae pneumonia and asthma are significantly correlated in terms of clinical symptoms. 17, 18 It has also been shown that allergic reactions are induced or aggravated by IgE-related hypersensitivity and Th2 immune reactions. [19] [20] [21] M. pneumoniae induces upper airway infections such as acute pharyngitis and laryngitis more frequently than lower airway infections. 22 Clyde 23 reported that 20% of patients with M. pneumoniae infection were asymptomatic, and that less than 5% of all patients with M. pneumoniae infection had lower airway infections such as pneumonia. Based on these results, it is conceivable that M. pneumoni-ae infection may stimulate or aggravate allergic reactions.",

VEGF, an endothelial cell-specific mitogenic peptide, serves as a vascular permeability factor and plays a crucial role in vasculogenesis and angiogenesis. It also induces extravasation of protein-rich plasma from the airway, increases vascular permeability, and causes airway inflammation through edema formation. 24, 25 Increased VEGF levels with M. pneumoniae infection suggest that M. pneumoniae stimulates allergic inflammation, as well as airway vascular angiogenesis and edema formation, consequently aggravating airway inflammation. In previous studies, the levels of IL-13, IL-4, and TNF-\u03b1 were increased with M. pneumoniae infection, suggesting that this infection can aggravate asthma symptoms. 26, 27 However, in our study, there were no significant differences in serum IL-13 and TNF-\u03b1 levels between admission phase and symptomatic recovery phase in any of the four study groups. This apparent discrepancy may be attributable to differences between the two study cohorts.",

This result agrees with previous results reported by Esposito et al. 28 Serum levels of VEGF and IL-5 were significantly higher at the time of symptomatic recovery phase than at admission phase. This implies that M. pneumonia infection stimulates bacterial inflammation as well as allergic inflammation, and that inflammation reactions related to VEGF and IL-5 persist even after recovery from M. pneumoniae pneumonia, prolonging allergic inflammation. The increased VEGF levels at the time of symptomatic recovery phase in our study suggest the presence of VEGF-induced increases in vascular permeability, airway vascular angiogenesis, and edema formation, all of which aggravate airway inflammation. Serum IL-5 levels at recovery phase were significantly higher in group I than in the other groups, indicating that IL-5-dependent allergic inflammatory reactions are persistently induced by M. pneumoniae infection in atopic children, but not in non-atopic children.",
