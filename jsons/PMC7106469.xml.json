The assay makes use of the ability of reverse transcriptase to synthesize DNA, starting from the template/primer hybrid poly (A) oligo (dT) 15. The digoxigenin- and biotin-labeled nucleotides in an optimized ratio are incorporated into one of the same DNA molecule, which is freshly synthesized by the reverse transcriptase (RT). The detection and quantification of synthesized DNA as a parameter for RT activity follows a sandwich ELISA protocol. Biotin-labeled DNA binds to the surface of streptavidin-precoated microtiter plate modules. In the next step, a precoated antibody to digoxigenin, conjugated to peroxidase, binds to the digoxigenin-labeled DNA. In the final step, the peroxidase substrate is added. The peroxidase enzyme catalyzes the cleavage of the substrate, forming a colored reaction product. The absorbance of the sample at 405 nm can be measured using a microtiter plate (ELISA) reader and is directly correlated to the level of RT activity. A fixed amount (4\u20136 ng) of recombinant HIV-1 reverse transcriptase was used. The inhibitory activity of the antifungal peptide was calculated as percent inhibition as compared to a control without the antifungal peptide (11). To investigate the thermal [0\u2013100 \u00b0C] stability of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase inhibitory activity, the isolated antifungal peptide was pretreated for 30 min accordingly and the assay was then conducted as mentioned above.",

The substrate for assay is a recombinant protein that has a cleavable linker sequence (TSAVLQ\u2193SGFRK) between two fluorescent proteins, viz cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) and yellow fluorescent protein (YFP). The former one is the donor protein of which the emission spectrum overlaps with the excitation spectrum of the latter acceptor protein. The reaction was performed in a mixture containing 5 \u03bcM SARS CoV protease, 5 \u03bcM sample, 20 \u03bcM substrate and buffer (20 mM Tris\u2013HCl (pH7.5), 20 mM NaCl and 10 mM beta-mercaptoethanol) for 40 min at 37 \u00b0C. After 40 min, the reaction was stopped by heating at 100 \u00b0C for 2 min. Then the reaction mixture was analyzed by SDS-PAGE. If SARS CoV protease is inhibited by the test sample, there is only one band, which is the intact substrate, shown in the SDS-PAGE.",

The results have been shown in a previous publication [17]. FPLC-ion exchange chromatography of fraction B2 on Mono S gave rise to several fractions (Fig. 1A). Purification of fraction S5 with antifungal activity was performed by gel filtration on a Superdex 75 column to yield a large peak (SU3) two small peaks (SU1 and SU2) (Fig. 1B).

The present study constitutes another report on the isolation of an antifungal peptide from seeds of the same species. Nevertheless, the N-terminal sequence of the antifungal peptide isolated in the present study, designated as campesin, is similar to that of BCLTP except for the replacement of some amino acids in BCLTP by more basic residues but different from those of antifungal peptides from B. parachinensis and B. alloglabra although all of them demonstrate pronounced thermostability and pH stability, HIV-1 reverse transcriptase inhibitory activity and antiproliferative activity toward tumor cells. They exert antifungal activity toward a variety of fungal species including F. oxysporum, M. arachidicola and a Helminthosporium species. Brassica parachinensis napin shows N-terminal sequence similarity to B. napus trypsin inhibitor as well as trypsin inhibitory activity (21). B. parachinensis antifungal peptide also exhibits N-terminal sequence to trypsin inhibitor but it is devoid of trypsin inhibitory activity (27). The absence of trypsin inhibitory activity in B. parachinensis antifungal peptide in spite of N-terminal sequence similarity to trypsin inhibitors is reminiscent of the lack of antifungal activity of thaumatin despite the fact that thaumatin-like proteins have antifungal activity (18). However, campesin does not resemble napin in N-terminal sequence and manifests no trypsin inhibitory activity. This is noteworthy in view of the fact that some of the trypsin inhibitors demonstrate antifungal activity (8). The two B. campestris antifungal peptides, campesin and BCLTP were isolated by using similar protocols. Ion exchange chromatography on Q-Sepharose, affinity chromatography on Affi-gel blue gel, ion exchange chromatography on Mono S and gel filtration on Superdex Peptide were used for purification of B. campestris lipid transfer peptide (29), the only difference in the present protocol being an additional gel filtration on Superdex 75.",

            "text": "Lysolecithin is employed as a model phospholipid for lipid transfer activity assay in this study since it manifests in aqueous solution a simple and quick equilibrium between dispersed monomeric molecules and micellar aggregates. Lipid binding by nsLTPs, in aqueous solution by fluorescence spectroscopy with substrate lyso-C12, was first studied using maize nsLTP and wheat nsLTP (34). The relative enhancement fluorescence intensity of campesin shows similarity to that of wheat nsLTP, while maize nsLTP evokes a considerably smaller relative increase (35). The presence of a stable lysolecithin\u2013protein complex in aqueous solution is analogous to a condition in which nsLTP serves as a carrier that can extract one lipid molecule from a membrane and transfer it to another (36). The results disclose that the relative increase of fluorescence intensity continues as lipid/protein ratio rises until a plateau is attained, indicating that the purified peptide possesses good lipid transfer activity. To date, it has been impossible to isolate a stable complex involving lysolecithin and to establish the model of binding of such a molecule to the nsLTP. Recent monolayer experiments (34) provide addition information on the interaction between the wheat nsLTP and diacylphospholipids. A model is proposed involving a collisional complex-shuttle mechanism. In this model, only one acyl chain of the lipid is inserted into the protein hydrophobic tunnel and the transfer implies an intimate contact between the donor and acceptor membranes to prevent transfer of the second acyl chain in the aqueous solvent. Ongoing studies aim to establish more precisely the binding mode of multiacyl phospholipids by nsLTPs.",
