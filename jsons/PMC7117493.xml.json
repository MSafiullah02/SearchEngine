Apoptosis is a physiological process defined by typical changes in cellular morphology and biochemical features including DNA fragmentation, cytoplasm vacuolization, chromatin condensation and margination and cellular breakdown into apoptotic bodies (Kerr et al., 1972). Intracellular pathways leading to apoptotic death can be activated either by viruses or by triggering cellular pathways that activate apoptotic program of the cell. In any case, virus-induced apoptosis could be detrimental for the host and it is a common event in lytic viral infections. Several animal and human coronaviruses are reported as acute lytic infections and apoptotic cell death can be one possible mechanism of cell damage induced by these viruses.",
