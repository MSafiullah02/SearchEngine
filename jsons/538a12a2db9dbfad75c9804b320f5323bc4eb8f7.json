We aimed to characterize the rate of and risk factors for infection, both present on admission and nosocomial, in this unique population. We hypothesized that infections would be associated with adverse outcomes such as short-term mortality. Methods We used descriptive statistics to characterize infections within a retrospective cohort characterized previously. We used multivariable logistic regression models to assess potential risk factors for infection and associations with key outcomes such as short-term mortality and length of stay. Results The study cohort of 1112 patients included 33% women with a mean age of 56 \u00b1 10 years. Infections were common (20%), with respiratory and urinary tract infections the most frequent. We did not observe a difference in the incidence of infection on admission based on patient demographic factors such as race/ethnicity or estimated household income. Infections on admission were associated with greater short-term mortality (12% vs 4% in-hospital and 14% vs 7% 30-day), longer length of stay (6 vs 3 days), intensive care unit admission (28% vs 18%), and acute-on-chronic liver failure (10% vs 2%) (p < 0.01 for all). Nosocomial infections were relatively uncommon (4%), but more frequent among patients admitted to the intensive care unit. Antibiotic resistance was common (38%), but not associated with negative outcomes. Conclusion We did not identify demographic risk factors for infection, but did confirm its morbid effect among patients with cirrhosis in safety-net hospitals.",

Experience from other diseases shows that there may be racial and socioeconomic disparities in the frequency and consequences of common bacterial infections [7] [8] [9] and the risk of antibiotic resistance [4, 10] between different racial and socioeconomic groups. Additionally, the risk of antibiotic resistance in patients with cirrhosis varies across continents and countries, demonstrating the need for tailored preventative and treatment strategies [4] . Urban safety-net hospitals provide care for many lowincome and uninsured patients and a disproportionate share of the care of minority patients and immigrants, particularly recent or undocumented immigrants [11] [12] [13] . Although the nature of infections among patients with cirrhosis in general is well described, specific differences in the nature of infections and associated outcomes among patients presenting to safety-net hospitals are largely unexplored.",

Study sites were Baylor University Medical Center (BUMC), Boston Medical Center-Boston University (BU), John H. Stroger Hospital of Cook County (JHS), and Sidney & Lois Eskenazi Hospital-Indiana University (IU). We reviewed data from the first hospital admission in calendar year 2012 of all patients with cirrhosis admitted at each center. Patients with cirrhosis were identified by review of the electronic medical record at each institution using previously validated International Classification of Diseases-9 codes for cirrhosis or its complications [15, 16] . Manual review of the chart was performed by an author at each center [ZF (BU), VVPK (IU, JSH), SA (BUMC)] to confirm the diagnosis of cirrhosis based on the combination of all data available in the medical record, including liver histology, radiographic studies, serum assays for estimation of fibrosis, laboratory values (i.e., albumin, platelet count, international normalized ratio), endoscopic stigmata of portal hypertension, and provider assessments. Covariates of interest were chosen for evaluation based on their strong potential to influence risk of infection or adverse outcomes. We excluded patients admitted for surgery due to their unique risks for infection and adverse outcomes. Missing values for Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) class were imputed (see \"Statistical Analyses\" section), and MELD-Sodium (MELD-Na) scores were calculated [17] . The institutional review board of each participating center independently reviewed and approved participation in the study.",

This suggests that the rate of infection on admission among patients with cirrhosis is not dependent upon any unique characteristics of patients admitted to safety-net hospitals. Consistent with this observation, we did not find differences in the presence of infection on admission based on demographic or socioeconomic factors that help to define the safety-net hospital patient population, including race/ethnicity, estimated household income, or insurance provider. This is in contrast to previously described infectionrelated disparities across racial/ethnic groups from other specialties. For example, a higher incidence of hospital acquired infections [7, 23] and greater infection-related hospitalization and in-hospital mortality [8, 9] has been observed among some minority populations. Indeed, it also may be that socioeconomic status, especially poverty, affects the risk of infection, as is the case for pediatric ear infections [24] . It is possible that the lack of association with household income observed here reflects inaccuracy of geographic income estimates or incompletely captured data in the medical record. Alternatively, it may be that cirrhosis itself represents so great a risk of infection that it supersedes any minor difference in risk associated with demographic characteristics.",

Due to the large effect of these associations, infection present on hospital admission itself was not independently associated with mortality when adjusted for the development of ACLF. However, infections themselves are among the most common causes of ACLF [6] . Because of this relationship, and as our definition of ACLF required information about the entire hospital course, we assessed for the association of infection with in-hospital mortality after exclusion of ACLF from the model. While still maintaining adjustment for other covariates such as MELD-Na, this revealed that infection on admission was associated with a twofold increase in the odds of in-hospital mortality.",

It is possible that admissions to other local hospitals not captured in the medical record could alter these results, although there is not a particular reason to suspect that use of outside hospitals varied based on the presence of infection. It is also possible that our sample was insufficient to confirm small absolute differences in readmission risk associated with infection.

Some of this is attributable to the expected greater prevalence of any degree of antibiotic resistance which we recorded in comparison to multi-drug resistance reported elsewhere [4] .

Contrary to our expectation, pre-admission prescription of antibiotics for prophylaxis of hepatic encephalopathy or SBP was not associated with documented antibiotic resistance.
