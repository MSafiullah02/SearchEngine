Notwithstanding the controversy surrounding the therapeutic relevance of SARS-CoV-2 associated antibodies, the donation of plasma derived J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof Similarly, the IL-1 receptor antagonist anakinra, may improve the clinical disposition of septic patients with COVID, especially those who harbor evidence of the macrophage activation syndrome [10].

His protracted and treatment-recalcitrant course had come to the point where a decision was made to consider cessation of care. However, it was finally agreed to try the HDMTX-LR regimen, which ultimately led to the complete recovery of the patient and resolution of all of the brain lesions which characterized his syndrome [ADD REF FOR PART I HERE]. J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof A more recent example considers the plight of a young accountant, who developed optic neuritis in August of 2017, approximately two weeks following a dTap vaccine and during the 3 rd trimester of her first pregnancy. Declining steroids, for fear of early term delivery, she recovered in a self-limited fashion. However, by October she presented again, this time with optic neuritis in the fellow eye, in addition to some sensory and motor manifestations. Investigations revealed an elevated, blood-derived anti-MOG antibody at a titer of 1:1000, and consistent with a post-vaccinal, anti-MOG associated encephalomyelitis. Treated with corticosteroids, she failed to improve. By December, our patient presented again with confusion, psychomotor slowing, and MRI demonstrating extensive and severe inflammatory lesions throughout much of the cerebral white matter. Coticosteroids once again were without effect, whereas the application of our HDMTX-LR protocol was tolerated without any adverse effects. This therapy rapidly attenuated the disease process, including normalization of her clinical manifestations, in conjunction with a remarkable disappearance of many of her white matter lesions [ADD REF FOR PART I]. A few months later, the appearance of new enhancing cerebral white matter leions prompted us to advance our regimen to a full course of plasma exchange (5-full volume exchanges; which took 8 days), followed by another course of HDMTX-LR. From the end of that course of therapy in early 2018 to the writing of this manuscript, there has been no recurrence, clinically or radiographically. In fact, most of the lesional burden has disappeared [ADD REF FOR PART I].",

One such example is called 'alarmin', which promotes acute inflammation followed by tissue repair [22] [23] [24] . The effects of HMGB1 is through its counterreceptor, a receptor for advanced glycan end products (RAGE), and is associated with cell maturation and migration to the site of injury, whereby chronic inflammation is perpetuated [25, 26] . Methotrexate can inhibit HMGB1 by directly binding to RAGE or indirectly by inhibition of cytokine production of TNF\u03b1, IL -1, IL-6, IL-8.",

Alternately, we herein hypothesize that a single agent endowed with a plethora of diverse and site selective targeting capabilities, each of which is sufficiently robust so as to uncouple the SARS-Co-V-2 induced PANIC Attack, may be used to lead the counter-attack. It is precisely for this reason that the WHO has long considered MTX as a 'necessary' medicine.",

To illustrate, we have prepared two scenarios as 'call out boxes' which contain an abbreviated vignette, followed by our specific plans of intervention [Box 1 and 2]. The goals for each scenario are to mitigate suffering, promote reconstitution of network immune coordinate regulation sufficient to prevent PANIC, but also to recognize and urgently treat PANIC when the features that define it are recognized by our front-line workers.",

This promotes bronchial smooth muscle relaxation, as well as activates the beta-2 adrenergic receptor on immune cells, thereby rendering them diminished in their inflammatory activity via activation and escalation of intracellular cyclic AMP (essentially biasing immune cells from a TH1 to TH2 anti-inflammatory phenotype). Further, low-dose weekly MTX (7.5 to 25mg taken po weekly along with 2mg of folate daily) could be utilized in those patients with mild to moderate COVID-19, but who persist or exhibit what appears to represent a more protracted and slowly advancing clinical deterioration. When compared to our HDMTX-LR intervention, low dose weekly oral MTX is not as prolific, nor as rapidly acting to exact remission. It can, nevertheless, exert a constellation of attenuating influences in response to the SARS-CoV-2 triggering of the broad expanse of the host immune networks.",

Further, this array of HDMTX-mediated coordinate actions may provide for the development of active immunity towards the SARS-CoV-2 infection, reflecting the very real prospect that such an intervention my serve to 'left-shift' the severe COVID-19 patient to the milder phenotype, along with a correspondingly improved prognosis. Our prior experience with the application of this intensive treatment strategy, and the nearly stereotyped remission in our patients, who, upon presentation, were codified as harboring treatment refractory syndromesof fulminant inflammatory disorders of CNS (e.g. multiple sclerosis (MS), neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD), Sjogren's associated myelitis, post-vaccinal (dTap) encephalomyelitis, and a series of cases of monumentally severe post-viral encephalomyelitides). A Novel, Host-Mediated Syndrome of Deleterious Immune Netword Activation: PANIC The observation of reminiscent 'PANIC Attack' mechanisms across our expanding set of fulminant inflammatory syndromes appears to be indistinguishable whether afflicting the CNS or the bronchopulmonary tree. These salient similarities have prompted us to extrapolate from our experience with treatment resistant, recalcitrant, and monumentally fulminant immune activation affecting our patients with MS, NMOSD, Sjogren's syndrome, and in a host of other circumstances where such catastrophic immune-mediated inflammation, can, if not identified and treated accordingly, obliterate the triggering agent's target tissue(s).We have since utilized the same protocol in many patients, who we now believe in retrospect were suffering from a form of 'PANIC' Attack, except targeting the central nervous system. In Part I of this two-part publication, we reported a patient suffering from a severe adenovirus-triggered PANIC Attack, characterized by cytokine storm, and an encephalomyelitis, with a PRESS-like pattern distribution of lesions [ADD REFERENCE FOR Interestingly, folate supplementation does not abolish either the anti-inflammatory, the chemotherapeutic actions, or the efficacy of MTX. This suggests that other mechanisms, independent of folate antagonism, must figure prominently in the potent actions of MTX. For instance, MTX administration provokes the release of adenosine, a potent anti-inflammatory agent that exerts regulatory effects upon neutrophils, macrophages, and T cells[15].",

Briefly, prior to therapy we ensure that the urine specific gravity is <1.1010, urinalysis and urine culture are without evidence of infection, the serum creatinine (Scr) is below 1.4mg/dl, and complete blood count (CBC), and the comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP) to include liver functions and electrolytes, are assessed prior to administration of HDMTX-LR. For purposes of reducing the risk of MTX crystalline deposition in the kidneys, D5W and sodium bicarbonate 100mEq are administered intravenously at a rate of 150ml/m 2 /hr for at least 8 hours prior to the administration of the HDMTX-LR protocol in order to achieve a urine pH of at least 8.0 before and during the entire HDMTX-LR infusion. MTX at 2500mg/m 2 in 250ml of normal saline is administered intravenously over 2 hours. Precisely 12 hours after the inception of the MTX infusion, we began leucovorin (folinic acid) rescue with 80mg given intravenously. Thereafter, leucovorin at 35mg is administered intravenously precisely every 6 hours for a total of 12 doses [Figure 1 & Protocol]. Serum MTX concentration levels are assessed at 24hr, 36hr, 48hr, and 72hr after the administration of HDMTX-LR. Patient discharge cannot proceed until the MTX concentration falls below 0.05\u03bcmolar (typically requiring a period of 24-72 hours). quinidine; Nuedexta daily) is utilized to treat infusion-related headaches. CBC, Scr, and CMP are assessed at baseline and then at weeks 1 and 4 following treatment with HDMTX-LR.Penicillin derivatives, probenecid, fluoroquinolones, sulfonamides, aspirin, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are known to decrease renal excretion of MTX and are therefore avoided during HDMTX-LR treatment. Vancomycin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole are avoided immediately prior to, and during HDMTX -LR administration to avoid potential additive or synergistic nephrotoxicity, and possible myelosuppression[13].A range of potential toxicities can be associated with the HDMTX-LR protocol, each of which however, can be markedly mitigated, if not prevented or abolished, with careful attention to the precise proscriptions of our protocol, and the use of systematic and sequential stepwise transitions to each phase of the therapeutic plan[Protocol]. Most important is that the HDMTX -LR protocol can be safely employed, while reducing risk of toxicity by ensuring vigorous hydration (to avoid MTX crystalline deposition), urine alkalinization (crystal formation is more likely in acid pH of the genitourinary system), along with the precisely-timed administration of the leucovorin rescue (to prevent mucositis).",

Instead, this third, and most ominous of the known J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof Coronaviruses, is characterized by its rapid and highly efficient transmissibility, the broad spectrum of clinical courses ranging from wholly asmptomatic (rendering such patients as a kind of 'typhoid Mary'), to a mild/moderate flu-like illness, and ultimately to the severe variant. The latter is principally recognized by the requirement for respiratory support, culminating in pressure ventilation, at which point the prognosis is poor, with most secumbing to the disease via the paroxysmal cessation of gas exchange, and the pathophysiologic signature of irreversible demise, treatment refractory hypoxic-ischemia. At this point, further interventions become an unnecessary and psychologically devastating exercise in futility for the patient, their family, and for the front-line care team. Herein we have underscored the serious nature of COVID-19, the manifestations and clinical and paraclinical factors which portend this ominous, and commonly irreversible, semiology. Further, we have dissected the manifold mechanisms, though not exhaustively, triggered by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which has led us to forge new principles with respect to microbial associated immune activation in a na\u00efve host. Mild to moderate COVID -19 is largely defined by the nature, magnitude, location, and whether such immune network responses are mechanistically coherent, and effective, while at the same time being sufficiently 'focalized'.Focalized responses signify a coordinately-regulated network immune response, one most capable of limiting the severity of end-organ tissue damage.",

            "text": "where conventional approaches have been futile. In this figure we emphasize the pleiotropic and discretely targeted actions of high-dose methotrexate, as a hypothetical intervention for the SARS-CoV-2 triggered PANIC Attack. The viral infection will produce the severe variant of COVID-19, principally secondary to the simultaneous activation of the diverse limbs of the human immune network (Figure 1). As such, productive therapeutic strategies are likely those which either combine different agents which target distinctly different mechanisms of immune activation, or we need to identify novel or existing monotherapies which are endowed with a diversity of actions capable of counteracting the PANIC Attack triggered by the SARS-CoV-2 agent in those afflicted with the severe variant of the disease. In A) we showcase methotrexate as a potent inhibitor of the folate-dependent enzyme systems, especially those which are essential in rapidly dividing cells; such as those of the hyper-activated immune system, given that the cell cycle synthesis (S) phase requires nucleoside precursors for the synthesis of both DNA and RNA by the de novo pathways; and as such for RNA replication of the SARS-CoV-2 agent. Other body cells overcome this base synthesis blockade by utilizing the so-called salvage pathways, where partially assembled and partially broken down bases can be utilized to complete the synthesis; which are not available to rapidly dividing cells and microbes such as the SARS-CoV-2 virus. MTX is polyglutamated following entry into cells, a molecular modification which serves to prevent its efflux back out of the cell. Once inside this form of the molecule effectively inhibits dihydrofolate reductase among other folate dependent enzyme systems, which ultimately inhibits the de novo biosynthetic pathways for purines and pyrimidines (necessary for both DNA and RNA); and as such it reduces RNA replication of the virus. In B) at 1:00 we illustrate the inhibitory effects of MTX on multiple transmembrane signaling pathways involved in inflammation, including the JAK-STAT pathways that are activated by a host of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-2, IL-6, IL-12, IL-15, GM-CSF, and IFN\u03b3. \u03baB signaling pathway for a series of inflammatory mediators such as IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, TNF\u03b1, and for matrix matalloproteases. MTX inhibits the production of these inflammatory mediators, but also liberates reactive oxygen species (ROS) which then engages JNK activation, which then can promote p53 activity which represents the final NF\u03baB sequence inhibitor (thereby blocking the effector functions of proinflammatory cytokines). Further JNK activation also activates the c-Fos and c-Fun pathways which culminate in the gene expression of pro-apoptotic gene expression and J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof increased sensitivity to apoptosis. In C) we illustrate the effect of MTX in its ability to block HMGB1 to the RAGE receptor, and thereby aborting the multiple downstream immune effector injury mechanisms that converge to destroy the lung alveoli in severe COVID -19. The attenuation of immune cell maturation, migration and transmigration across the alveoli epithelia (utilizing matrix metalloproteinases which digest fibronectin, collagen, and other matrix elements that constitute the integrity of tissue elements), and the release of cytokines and other inflammatory mediators by either active release mechanisms, or via the passive release secondary to the expulsion from damaged or dying cells (a process referred to as pyroptosis; inflammatory apoptosis) are additional alveolar injury pathways that are blocked by MTX. In D) we emphasize a series of risk mitigation interventions that are crucial when using HDMTX -LR (all of which are further discussed in the text).

Given parameters, patients can provide their managing physicians with crucial information as to whether the COVID-19 clinical course is deteriorating, and hence the need Postural Percussion performed by husband to facilitate pulmonary hygiene (formerly pulmonary toilet to mobilize and promote mucus clearance) 2. Incentive Spirometry for deep breathing and exercise of respiratory muscles Cough:Non-Productive Dextromethorphan Dextromethorphan (DM) + Quinidine; Nuedexta; (the latter reduces the metabolism of DM). Quinidine is a derivative of quinine, from the Peruvian Cinchona tree, as are chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine; all of which have been observed to reduce viral replication and cytokine release in vitro. Levalbuterol; also known as L-albuterol (Xopenex) and is the active form of the drug called R-albuterol. Fewer side effects than with racemic albuterol (which is a 50:50 mixture of R and S form). Pharmacologically acts via the beta -2 adrenergic receptor on bronchial smooth muscle thereby relaxing the distal extent of the bronchopulmonary tree. Can reduce the 'tight lung' perception, and via bronchodilation can facilitate mobilization of mucus and avoid inspisated mucus organization.

While the ER physician's diagnosis was COVID-19, no confirmatory testing was performed. However, laboratory testing did reveal lymphopenia (absolute number of 250), a CRP of 2.75, normal D-Dimer, and she was discharged to home.Over subsequent days, and nearly daily telemedicine conference calls, it was evident that her flu-like symptoms persisted, if not intensifying (cough, perception of reduced negative inspiratory force (NIF), persistent fever, and the perception of chest tightness). A series of recommendations were made in an attempt to both mitigate symptoms, but also to potentially reduce the induction of the SARS-CoV-2 induced PANIC Attack. The patient was lymphopenic on dimethyl fumarate (a recognized association) and with suspected COVID-19. The significant lymphopenia places this patient at risk for PML, although the lymphopenia can also be secondary to COVID-19.",
