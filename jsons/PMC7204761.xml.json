In fact, the close proximity of gatherings in addition to environmental factors during air and sea travel appear to hasten the spread of respiratory viruses such as SARS-CoV-2. The limited available space on both ships and airplanes not only creates confined spaces for airborne droplet transmission but also provides abundant fomites for disease transmission because of large groups of people sharing common areas, such as dining areas and restrooms. Door handles, serving utensils, and other objects are repeatedly handled, and hand hygiene may not be consistently performed. Cruise ships appear to be an extremely high-risk environment for virus transmission.",

This initially led to the development of the mobile acute care strike team, which was intended to serve as a critical care resuscitation and stabilization unit to hold patients awaiting departure from a disaster air medical staging facility (DASF). Patients would arrive from their point of injury/illness to the DASF to await DoD flights to definitive care. The DASF is often collocated with a US Air Force medical group, which provides care to less acute patients and serves as a liaison for military air transport. During a busy hurricane season in 2017, the need for nonmilitary critical care air transport was identified, and the concept behind the HHS AET was born. The HHS AE Team is composed of active critical care and air transport providers who have received training through 2 pathways: the US Air Force School of Aerospace Medicine Critical Care Air Transport program (2-4 weeks) or the HHS partnership with Florida International University air medical evacuation course (1-2 weeks). After training, these providers have participated in ongoing validation with multiple air medical transport teams nationwide.",

The need for increased capability led to the development of the Containerized Bio-Containment System, which is able to transport 4 infectious patients in an intensive care unit environment. In conjunction with the DoS contract, the Containerized Biological Containment System was used on overseas repatriation missions inside a Boeing 747-400 aircraft, which was reconfigured for mixed passenger/cargo work (Fig. 1\n).",

Only patients likely to survive transport will be evacuated. Especially in the case of pulmonary insult, which is predominant in SARS, patients requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation may need to complete therapy before air medical evacuation. The physiologic effects of flight and confinement can be difficult for healthy patients, much less those with extensive pathology. Dependent on the specific platform used for the mission, mechanical ventilation may not be possible, further necessitating stabilization before transport. Additionally, patients with hemodynamic instability, severe anemia, and conditions that may be aggravated at altitude (eg, a pneumothorax, bowel obstruction, and pneumocephalus) should be treated before transport.",

A total of approximately 800 passengers were repatriated via charter flights from Wuhan to the United States.

Two of those flights continued from Travis Air Force Base, CA; Miramar Marine Corps Air Station, San Diego, CA; Lackland Air Force Base, TX; and Camp Ashland, NE, carrying several hundred of the Wuhan evacuees with HHS AETs on board to provide medical monitoring and support.

Aircraft with reduced postmission airing out time offer an added benefit. It is essential that cabin ventilation remain on at all times, including ground delays.

Some crews required an additional day of charter or commercial flights to return to the original base of operations. Steps to mitigate fatigue included adding crews to the staffing rotation to maintain mission tempo and sustain operations. Postmission crew rest periods ranged from 8 to 12 hours before crews reentered the call rotation. Paying special attention to PPE doffing at mission completion to avoid contamination was essential. This was accomplished with a \u201cspotter\u201d when staffing allowed. As a result of the sustained high operational tempo, crews were generally only on deployed rotation for 14 days.",
