However, a potential mechanism underlying the association between high-grade CRS and infection is unclear. Although high-grade CRS is correlated with robust CAR T-cell expansion [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] and preclinical studies have demonstrated that tonic CAR signaling may induce early exhaustion of T cells [24] , there is currently no evidence to suggest that these T cells lead to immune dysfunction.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 652, "end": 656, "text": "[23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 837, "end": 840, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 841, "end": 844, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 845, "end": 848, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 849, "end": 852, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 853, "end": 856, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 963, "end": 967, "text": "[24]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "Because sepsis due to infection can trigger a cytokine storm [25] and potentially lead to higher proinflammatory cytokines in patients with CRS due to CTI, we examined cytokine profiles in patients who experienced CRS with or without documented infection and found that although cytokine levels correspond to the severity of CRS, the pattern did not differ in patients with CRS with or without concomitant infection. This finding suggests that it is unlikely infection exacerbated CRS by altering cytokine levels, but further studies are required to investigate whether high levels of proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory G. sputi BSI cytokines and immunosuppressive therapies contribute to the increased risk of infections in patients with severe CRS. Nonetheless, infections can occur together during times of CRS, and clinicians should be aware of infectious complications, because signs and symptoms of CRS and sepsis are often difficult to distinguish, with differences in management (eg, use of IL-6-directed therapies and corticosteroids in CRS) [26] [27] [28] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 61, "end": 65, "text": "[25]", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 1054, "end": 1058, "text": "[26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 1059, "end": 1063, "text": "[27]", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 1064, "end": 1068, "text": "[28]", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "To date, there are no standardized antimicrobial prophylactic practices in patients undergoing CTI for B-ALL.
