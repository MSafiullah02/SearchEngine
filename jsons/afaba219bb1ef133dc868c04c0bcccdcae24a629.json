This is supported by the discovery of new arboviruses [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] and novel and highly divergent flaviviruses such as Tamana bat virus, 13 Ngoye virus, 14 Nounane\u0301virus (NOUV), 15 and Lammi virus (LAMV). 16 In Saudi Arabia, at least five vector-borne flaviviruses are circulating including DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3, DENV-4, and AHFV in addition to two other arboviruses (Rift Valley fever virus [RVFV] and Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever virus [CCHF] ).

This is further complicated when broad range of viruses are expected as in the case of viral febrile illness. Therefore, genus-specific diagnostic approaches can be used because they are less sensitive to failure compared to targeted molecular approaches.

However, most of these techniques depend on the use of conventional RT-PCR format, nested PCR, and agarose gel electrophoresis which could hamper the sensitivity and specificity of these assays due to PCR contamination and false-positive results. Moureau et al developed a single-step universal flaviviruses (pan-flaviviruses) real-time RT-PCR which was able to identify at least 54 different known or tentative flaviviruses. 38 This assay combines the SybrGreen format of the real-time PCR which facilitate large-scale testing without PCR contamination risk, and the universal detection of known and tentative flavivirus species. The sensitivity of this assay was found to be high (>50 copies/reaction) which permitted the detection of several flaviviruses from field and clinical samples. Most importantly, sequencing of the short NS5 fragment amplified by this assay (\u223c232 nts) is suitable for reliable identification and taxonomic characterization of flaviviruses as well as the discovery of novel viral species. Therefore, this study was designed not only to screen for possible circulation and/or introduction of new or previously uncharacterized flaviviruses such as ZIKAV but also to phylogenetically characterize circulating DENV in the western region of Saudi Arabia using this pan-flaviviruses assay. 38 2 | MATERIALS AND METHODS 2.1 | Samples A total of 690 human plasma samples collected over a period of 6 years between January 2010 and December 2015 were retrieved from the Special Infectious Agents Unit, King Fahd Medical Research Center,", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF1": {"text": "reconstruction was performed by using the Maximum Likelihood statistical method based on Kimura 2-parameter substitution model or Tamura-Nei model.

However, whether other flaviviral species are circulating in the Kingdom is not known because of the few number of surveillance studies. Several emerging and re-emerging flaviviruses such as ZIKAV are being reported and characterized globally. This is of great concern especially for countries such as Saudi Arabia where the largest annual mass-gathering event (Hajj) may exacerbate the spread of these viruses all over the world.

While we did not find any evidence of ZIKAV nor any unexpected flaviviruses in the current study, the potential introduction of such viruses into Saudi is highly possible during Hajj and Umrah pilgrimages especially with the rapidly increasing number of Zika cases. Therefore, further surveillance studies are necessary to confirm the absence of ZIKAV in Saudi Arabia.

However, we did not detect any DENV-1 or DENV-4 in the tested samples. While these results may suggest low circulation of these viruses, more samples should be tested to draw such conclusion.Nonetheless, our results are consistent with the known endemicity of DENV in western region of Saudi Arabia.AHFV is a newly characterized flavivirus first isolated in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, in 1995.46 Until now, AHFV has been isolated sporadically from humans and ticks in Saudi Arabia and Egypt and shown to have high mortality rate (\u223c25%).20,47,48 Whether the reported numbers of cases reflect the actual incidence of AHFV infections is not known mostly due to the limited epidemiological studies and/or misdiagnosis. The isolation of AHFV in the current study from one of the samples which was originally examined for DENV only clearly provides an evidence that many cases of AHFV are being missed during clinical testing. Thus, implementation of assays such as the one used in this study could be an important diagnostic and research tool. The observed low diversity and slow microevolution of AHFV is consistent with the sporadic nature of the infection and the limited number of reported cases, most probably due to the less mobile vector (ticks). Furthermore, while this low genetic diversity suggests that current molecular tests are still suitable for AHFV diagnosis, it is critical to carry out more genomic studies not only to enhance diagnostic tools but also to better understand the replication and pathogenesis of AHFV and to develop vaccines and therapeutics.", "latex": null, "type": "table"}}, "back_matter": []}
