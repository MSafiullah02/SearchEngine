We now have (1) psychologically and biologically plausible explanations of psychosocial influences on the pathogenesis of infectious agents; (2) substantial evidence that stressors can alter both cellular and humoral immune function; (3) evidence for a role of stress in determining susceptibility for a small number of infectious agents; and (4) evidence for the role of stress in activating latent viral (herpes) infections. However, we still know little about the characteristics of psychosocial factors that increase or decrease risk of disease onset and progression and of the nature of immune changes that are responsible for psychosocial-induced changes in disease risk. There are still no direct demonstrations that proposed mechanisms link psychosocial factors to disease and hence little real understanding of the extent to which evidence deriving from one infectious disease model generalizes to another.",

There is substantial evidence that stress and other psychosocial factors influence immunity (Herbert & Cohen, 1993b; Jemmott & Locke, 1984; OLeary, 1990), as well as basic research delineating the pathways through which this influence may occur. Stress may influence immunity through direct innervation of the central nervous (CNS) and immune systems or through neuroendocrine-immune pathways. Direct neural pathways linking the CNS to the immune system have been identified (Feiten et al., 1985; Feiten & Olschowka, 1987). In the case of hormonal pathways, catecholamines secreted by the adrenal-medulla in response to stressors, and stressor-triggered pituitary mediated hormones such as cortisol and prolactin have been associated with modulation of immune function (see Hall & Goldstein, 1981; Laudenslager, 1988; Rabin et al., 1989). Moreover, receptors for ACTH, TSH, growth hormone, prolactin, and catecholamines have been found on lymphocytes (see reviews by Rabin et al., 1989). The existence of these receptors suggests that these hormones play a role in modulating lymphocyte function.",

For example, stressed persons often engage in social coping, i.e., drawing on resources from their social networks (Cohen & Wills, 1985). Increased interaction with others results in greater probability of exposure to infectious agents and consequent infection. However, social interaction under stress is influenced by both the nature of the stressor and individual differences in social skills and affiliative tendencies. Hence, under some conditions stress may lead to social withdrawal and decreased risk of exposure. Other stress elicited behaviors, for example, unsafe sexual practices or poor hygienic practices, could also increase exposure to infectious agents.",

Although there are few studies directly addressing the possible role of biologic, sociologic, and psychologic characteristics as moderators of the relation between stress and immunity (e.g., Cohen, Kaplan, Cunnick, Manuck, & Rabin, 1993; Manuck, Cohen, Rabin, Muldoon, & Bachen, 1991), evidence from other areas of health suggests that further understanding of the importance of individual differences in response to stressors is paramount in understanding the role of stress in disease susceptibility and progression (see reviews by Cohen & Wills, 1985; Cohen & Edwards, 1989; Gentry & Kobasa, 1984).",

They do, however, suggest the complexity of the phenomenon (reviews by Friedman et al., 1965; Plaut & Friedman, 1981; Rogers et al., 1979). Stressor influences on susceptibility to infectious agents depend on the species of experimental animal, the type of stimulation, the timing of acute stressor administration relative to the infectious challenge, and the infectious agent. This work underscores the importance of identifying the behavioral and biological pathways that link psychosocial factors to disease susceptibility including identifying the parameters of immunity that are important in the face of different pathogens. Some of the problems we find in applying these results to understanding the influence of social stressors on human susceptibility include that the stressors were relatively short-lived, primarily involved physical stimulation, and were qualitatively unlike those that either human or rodent would confront outside of the laboratory. The lack of generalization of results across strains of mice and rats also suggests that rodent models are not appropriate for answering questions about psychosocial influences on human infectious susceptibility.",

Some antibodies remain in circulation and help fight the same infectious agent upon later exposure. Presence of antibodies also provides evidence of prior exposure.

To determine whether these relations might be attributable to the stress scales actually reflecting personality characteristics, we ran an additional analysis in which the three personality factors were added to the equation. Again, the relations between stress and illness were independent of these personality characteristics. In a series of final analyses, the three stress scales were entered into equations simultaneously (in pairs) in order to assess whether they were independently associated with illness.

Additional analyses addressed this issue. The first analysis assessed whether the reported relations between the various stress measures and clinical colds were partly or wholly attributable to an association between these scales and increased infection. As apparent from Figure 3\n, infection rates were higher for those above the median of all four measures. However, these differences were reliable for the stress index, perceived stress, and negative affect but not for stressful life events. The second analysis assessed whether the reported relations between the various stress measures and clinical colds were partly or wholly attributable to associations between stress and becoming sick (developing clinical symptoms) following infection. Because these analyses included only persons who were infected, the results are independent of earlier analyses predicting infection. As apparent from Figure 4\n, only life events approached reliable prediction of colds among infected persons.",

Stress has been defined broadly and has included environmental events such as taking examinations and bereavement, affective disorders such as depression, and self-reports of stress and negative affect. Current work is moving toward clearer understanding of the characteristics of situations that influence immune function. It is also examining the kind of psychologic and psychophysiologic responses to situations requisite for immune change. This includes identifying the nature, domain, and timing (relative to immune change and infectious susceptibility) of stressors that influence immunity. It also includes differentiating various types of affective responses (e.g., anxiety, depression, anger) to stressors and identifying the types of affect that play a role in stressor-immune relations. There is also an expansion of psychosocial factors under consideration including closer examination of characteristics of the individual that might protect them from the potential influences of stressors on immunity such as social support systems and personality characteristics. Personality is also being studied as an independent influence on immune status and infectious susceptibility.",
