With the spread of the disease, novel coronavirus cases have been found in other parts of China and other countries in the world. As an ongoing coronavirus outbreak, the Chinese government has paid great attention to this situation. On 21 January 2020, the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China announced 2019\u2010nCoV pneumonia as a category B infectious disease, and preventive and control measures were taken according to category A infectious disease.",

This coronavirus belongs to the genus \u03b2 and has an envelope; its particles are round or oval, often polymorphic, and 60 to 140 nm in diameter. The genetic characteristics of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 are significantly different from those of SARS\u2010CoV and MERS\u2010CoV. Current research shows that SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 has more than 85% homology with bat SARS\u2010like coronavirus (Bat\u2010SL\u2010CoV ZC45).\n2\n Therefore, it is now believed that the original host of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 may have been Rhinolophus sinicus.\n3\n A study team from South China Agricultural University pointed out that pangolins may be one of the intermediate hosts of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102, through which the virus may spread to humans. Relevant research teams are being organized by the Chinese government to further support this view. The outbreak is considered to be closely related to Wuhan's Huanan wholesale seafood market.\n4\n, \n5\n, \n6\n, \n7\n Epidemiological surveys have shown that 27 of 41 people with the earliest onset have visited the market.\n8\n Post hoc investigations also revealed that there was a wildlife trade in this market, and SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 has also been isolated from the market's environment. Human\u2010to\u2010human transmission emerged shortly thereafter.\n9\n Patients with COVID\u201019 have become the main source of infection. COVID\u201019 may be capable of transmission during the incubation period.\n10\n, \n11\n These patients are difficult to diagnose and isolate in time, which causes great difficulties in the prevention and control of the disease. However, up to date, there is no enough evidence to support the role of asymptomatic patients in the transmission of COVID\u201019. In addition, the presence of the virus can be detected in patients during the recovery stage, especially in fecal specimens requiring longer detoxification times, indicating the possible risk of fecal\u2010oral transmission.\n11\n SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 is a positive\u2010stranded RNA virus that is susceptible to gene mutation and recombination, but so far, no significant mutations have been found in humans or the environment.\n2\n, \n12\n\n",

            "text": "At present, droplets inhaled into the respiratory tract and contact transmission are considered to be the most important routes of transmission. There is no direct evidence showing that COVID\u201019 can be transmitted through aerosols. The WHO believes that further evidence is needed to assess the possibility of aerosol transmission. However, some of the observations suggest that aerosol propagation is possible under the condition of long exposure to high concentrations of aerosols in a relatively closed environment. In the early stages of the outbreak of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 pneumonia, it is uncertain whether stool samples from patients are infectious. However, Lu et al,\n2\n using a computer structural simulation, found that the S\u2010protein of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 can bind to human angiotensin\u2010converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in the spatial conformation. After that, Letko et al\n13\n synthesized the S\u2010protein of SARS and the receptor\u2010binding domain (RBD) of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 in vitro and reacted with known human coronavirus receptors, respectively. As a result, the RBD of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 is similar to the S protein in SARS, and it can directly bind to human ACE2. ACE2 is a metalloproteinase belonging to a type I transmembrane glycoprotein, and it can be expressed in the small intestine.\n14\n, \n15\n In our laboratory, it was also found that nucleic acid amplification testing of stool samples can still be positive for a long time after oral swab samples become negative. In addition, a large number of clinical studies have shown that a certain proportion of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 pneumonia patients develop symptoms of diarrhea.\n10\n, \n16\n It can be concluded that during the development of the disease, there is a greater possibility of the virus in the stool. Recently, SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 has been isolated from the stool of confirmed patients in Wuhan and Shenzhen, China, and in the United States,\n17\n indicating that the virus can replicate and survive in the digestive tract. However, it is not clear whether the infection and transmission are caused by eating food contaminated with the virus. Through the analysis of the current epidemic situation, some scholars believe that viruses in feces may be retransmitted by the aerosol formation of virus\u2010containing droplets. SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 also has adverse effects on fetuses and infants, including restricted intrauterine growth, premature birth, spontaneous abortion, and perinatal death.\n18\n However, the possibility of intrauterine mother\u2010to\u2010child transmission of COVID\u201019 is very low, and neither of the two existing retrospective clinical studies have found direct evidence of intrauterine vertical transmission.\n19\n, \n20\n\n",

Hubei and Wuhan reported no new confirmed or suspected cases for 5 consecutive days, and the number of confirmed cases continued to drop. These results indicate that China's preventions and treatments against COVID\u201019 have achieved good results. In the past month or so, China has issued a series of national recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of respiratory infections caused by SARS\u2010CoV\u20102.\n45\n These recommendations have now been updated to version 7. Recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of respiratory infection caused by SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 in children were also drafted by the National Clinical Research Center for Child Health, Children's Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, to further standardize the protocol for diagnosis and treatment of respiratory infection in children caused by SARS\u2010CoV\u20102.\n46\n Chinese medical workers have gradually formed some effective diagnosis and treatment strategies and methods in clinical practice of antiviral therapy and symptomatic treatment, including a comprehensive series of diagnosis and treatment methods such as respiratory support, circulatory support, and immunity improvement, to accelerate recovery.\n47\n Antiviral drugs (ganciclovir, acyclovir, and ribavirin) and neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir, paramivir, zanamivir, etc) commonly used in clinical practice, are ineffective on COVID\u201019 and are not recommended. Drugs that are possibly effective on COVID\u201019 include remdesivir, lopinavir/ritonavir, lopinavir/ritonavir combined with interferon\u2010\u03b2, convalescent plasma, and monoclonal antibodies.\n48\n However, the efficacy and safety of these drugs for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 pneumonia patients need to be assessed by further clinical trials. Chinese researchers recently discovered that the anti\u2010malarial drug chloroquine phosphate has an effect on the treatment of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 pneumonia through drug screening and clinical trials. Preliminary evidence suggests that chloroquine phosphate can significantly reduce the exacerbation rate of patients with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 pneumonia, has an antipyretic function, can accelerate pulmonary inflammation recovery, shorten the negative time and increase the negative conversion rate of viral nucleic acids, and shorten the course of the disease. In addition, chloroquine phosphate is relatively safe, and no serious adverse reactions related to the drug have been found so far. The drug has been included in the latest edition of the Chinese diagnosis and treatment guidelines for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 pneumonia treatment updated on 3 March 2020, to expand the scope of clinical trials. However, the efficacy of this drug should be further evaluated in clinical application. Use should be discontinued when there is an intolerable side effect. Patients with COVID\u201019 treated with chloroquine phosphate must have a normal electrocardiogram before medication. The combination uses chloroquine phosphate with macrolides including azithromycin or other drugs that may cause a prolonged QT interval are prohibited in China. However, a study from France showed that azithromycin added to hydroxychloroquine was significantly more efficient for virus elimination in COVID\u201019 patients. In this study, among hydroxychloroquine\u2010treated patients six patients received azithromycin to prevent bacterial super\u2010infection under daily electrocardiogram control, 100% of patients were virologicaly cured.\n49\n Although the study sample size was small, the results require further confirmation. However, the study offers an insight: whether this compound could be useful as chemoprophylaxis to prevent the transmission of the virus, especially for health care workers.",

The convalescent plasma therapy was developed using a virus\u2010free plasma containing high\u2010titer SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 specific antibodies donated from rehabilitated patients. This therapy will be applied clinically after virus inactivation, antibody titer determination, and multiple pathogenic microorganism determination. On 22 January the Chinese research group incorporated the preparation of exempt plasma from rehabilitated SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 pneumonia patients into the scientific research emergency project. The first plasma from patients with a recovery period was collected on 1 February 2020, and coronavirus\u2010free plasma was then prepared. On 9 February 2020, the first severely ill patient received SARS\u2010CoV\u20102\u2010free plasma treatment at a hospital in Wuhan, and more patients subsequently received the therapy. Clinical studies have shown that SARS\u2010CoV\u20102\u2010free plasma is safe and effective for critically ill patients. The therapeutic method has been added to the latest guidelines (version 6) for critically ill patients. In addition, China has organized several research groups to explore the role of Chinese medicine in the prevention and treatment of COVID\u201019 and has achieved a certain effect.",

However, it is now found that about 0.1% of patients will be tested positive for nucleic acid again after discharge.\n50\n There are many reasons for the positive nucleic acid test of discharged patients.\n51\n The reagent itself, detection method, sampling method, and so on will affect the positive rate. In addition, the possibility of disease recurrence cannot be ruled out too. Genomic analysis of the virus from different regions, different periods and different sources of patients revealed that SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 was stable and showed no major variation. So once the patient is cured with immunity against the virus, there is little chance of reinfection. The detection of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 specific IgM and IgG antibodies is an effective means to determine whether a patient has immunity against SARS\u2010CoV\u20102. But these patients still have the potential to infect others. Therefore, after the patient is discharged from the hospital, it is recommended to continue the isolation management and health condition monitoring for 14 days. Here are some tips and considerations for self\u2010isolation: wear a mask, live in a single room with good ventilation, reduce close contact with family members, separate meals, good hand hygiene, and avoid outdoor activities. It is also recommended to visit the hospital for reexamination on the 14th and 28th days after discharge.",

The principle of \"four centralization\" is to centralize patients, centralize experts, centralize resources, and centralize treatment. Patients with severe illness are centralized at the best hospital with the strongest comprehensive capacity for treatment. At the same time, to centralize resources and experts to treat critically ill patients, multidisciplinary and comprehensive individualized diagnosis and treatment are applied in accordance with \"one person, one strategy,\" and finally, the mortality rate is effectively reduced.",

COVID\u201019 is mainly transmitted through respiratory droplets and contact, and the population is generally susceptible.
