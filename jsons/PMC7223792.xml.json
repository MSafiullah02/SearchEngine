Much like the rest of Europe, France has been hit hard by the epidemic and went into lockdown on the 17 March 2020. It was hoped that this would result in a sharp decline in ongoing spread, as was observed when China locked down following the initial emergence of the virus (1, 2). Following the expected reduction in cases, the French government has announced it will ease restrictions on the 11 May 2020. To exit from the lockdown without escalating infections, we need to understand the underlying level of population immunity and infection, identify those most at risk for severe disease and the impact of current control efforts.",

The mean age of hospitalized patients was 68ya and the mean age of the deceased was 79ya with 50.0% of hospitalizations occurring in individuals >70ya and 81.6% of deaths within that age bracket; 56.2% of hospitalizations and 60.3% of deaths were male (Fig. 1, C to E). To reconstruct the dynamics of all infections, including mild ones, we jointly analyze French hospital data with the results of a detailed outbreak investigation aboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship where all passengers were subsequently tested (719 infections, 14 deaths currently). By coupling the passive surveillance data from French hospitals with the active surveillance performed aboard the Diamond Princess, we disentangle the risk of being hospitalized in those infected from the underlying probability of infection (5, 6).",

Once hospitalized, on average 19.0% (95% CrI: 18.7\u201319.4%) patients enter ICU after a mean delay of 1.5 days (fig. S1).

S5, and tables S4 to S6), allowing for reduced age-specific daily contact patterns following the lockdown and changing patterns of ICU admission over time (fig. S17). We find that the basic reproductive number R0 prior to the implementation of the lockdown was 2.90 (95% CrI: 2.80\u20132.99). The lockdown resulted in a 77% (95% CI: 76\u201378) reduction in transmission, with the reproduction number R dropping to 0.67 (95% CrI: 0.65\u20130.68). We forecast that by the 11 May 2020, 2.8 million (range: 1.8\u20134.7, when accounting for uncertainty in the probability of hospitalization given infection) people will have been infected, representing 4.4% (range: 2.8\u20137.2) of the French population (Fig. 3E). This proportion will be 9.9% (range: 6.6\u201315.7) in Ile-de-France, which includes Paris, and 9.1% (range: 6.0\u201314.6) in Grand Est, the two most affected regions of the country (Fig. 3F and fig. S5). Assuming a basic reproductive number of R0 = 3.0, it would require around 65% of the population to be immune for the epidemic to be controlled by immunity alone. Our results therefore strongly suggest that, without a vaccine, herd immunity on its own will be insufficient to avoid a second wave at the end of the lockdown. Efficient control measures need to be maintained beyond the 11 May.",

Hospital admissions have declined from 3600 to 357 over the same time period, with consistent declines observed throughout France (fig. S5). By 11 May we project 3900 (range: 2600\u20136300) daily infections across the country, down from between 150,000\u2013390,000 immediately prior to the lockdown. At a regional level, we estimate that 58% of infections will be in Ile-de-France and Grand Est combined. We find that the time people spend in ICU appears to differ across the country, which may be due to differences in health care practices (table S5).",

S6). As a validation, our approach is also able to correctly identify parameters in simulated datasets where the true values are known (fig. S7). As cruise ship passengers may represent a different, healthier population than average French citizens, we run a sensitivity analysis where Diamond Princess passengers are 25% less likely to die than French citizens (Fig. 4 and fig. S8). We also run sensitivity analyses with longer delays between symptom onset and hospital admission, missed infections aboard the Diamond Princess, equal attack rates across all ages, reduced infectivity in younger individuals, a contact matrix with unchanged structure before/during the lockdown and one with very high isolation of elderly individuals during the lockdown. These different scenarios result in mean IFRs from 0.5 to 0.9%, the proportion of the population infected by the 11 May 2020 ranging from 1.7\u20138.9%, the number of daily infections at this date ranging from 1700 to 9600 and a range of reproductive numbers post lockdown of 0.62\u20130.73 (Fig. 4, figs.
