Westernization seems to be associated with an increased prevalence of allergic disorders (asthma, eczema, rhinitis); the mechanisms involved are still under investigation, but several lines of evidence exist for a deviation of the immune response away from Th1 (protective immunoglobulin IgG immunity and delayed hypersensitivity) toward Th2 (atopy with IgE production) by decreased bacterial contact. As in asthma, multiple genes are involved, many of these code for epithelial molecules concerned with innate immunity. Nasal polyposis also demonstrates a strong heritable component with a relative risk of 18 times the normal rate and 6 times the normal rate with an affected father and mother, respectively. There are a number of genes associated with aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease-e.g., leukotriene C4 synthase promoter region-which vary among different populations. HLA-DQB1 is associated with allergic fungal sinusitis. The genetics of cystic fibrosis are discussed in Chapter 46; heterozygotes for cystic fibrosis are overrepresented in the chronic rhinosinusitis population. Primary ciliary dyskinesia is also genetic, with an incidence of approximately 1 in 20,000. Various structural ciliary defects have been described, but one common defect-a lack of inducible nitric oxide synthase in nasal mucosa-has recently been found.",

Viral invasion occurs at the point of infection usually in the posterior nasopharynx and results in transient vasoconstriction of the mucous membrane followed by vasodilatation and edema with mucus production. A leukocytic inflammatory infiltrate develops, followed by desquamation of mucous epithelial cells. Initially, a clear watery secretion is produced, but it is followed by epithelial desquamation with opacification of secretions, which does not necessarily indicate bacterial infection, which complicates only approximately 2% of colds. Resolution occurs in a few days in uncomplicated viral infections; however, allergic individuals have more colds of greater severity than no atopic individuals.

In children with rhinitis, subcutaneous immunotherapy reduces progression to asthma at 3, 5, and 10 years afterwards. There is also a reduction in new allergic sensitization. Desensitization involves the administration of increasing doses of relevant allergen extract by subcutaneous injection over a period of months and has been shown to effectively diminish symptoms of allergic seasonal rhinitis to grass pollen, ragweed, and birch pollen. Some studies also suggest efficacy to house dust mite and some animal danders. Desensitization has largely been superseded by the success of effective medical therapy in the suppression of allergic inflammation and so is reserved for nonresponders with severe disease. It is not always effective, and concerns have been raised regarding occasional anaphylactic reactions and deaths after the procedure, so it must be undertaken by well-trained individuals in a hospital setting with cardiorespiratory resuscitation facilities at hand. Safer sublingual approaches have now been demonstrated to be effective, and grass pollen tablets will become available in the United Kingdom in 2007. The first sublingual dose needs to be under medical supervision; after this, each dose is taken every day at home. Eight weeks preseasonal therapy followed by continuation throughout the pollen season is suggested. Trials are in progress to assess the long-term effects of 3 years regular treatment.",
