Given the nature of a prospective study of immunocompromised patients, it was not possible to have extremely well matched comparator groups, but they were reasonably well matched (Table 2). Most participants were between the ages of 18 and 65 with a mean age of 25.55. This mean age of approximately 25 is consistent with the fact that the 2009 A(H1N1)pdm09 virus was the most prevalent virus identified in this study, and that much of this study was performed during the 2009 pandemic and post-pandemic period when a slightly younger population was more affected by influenza than during a typical influenza season [30]",

The immunocompromised patients experienced more hospitalizations, longer lengths of influenza virus shedding, and more severe disease and complications requiring intensive care and mechanical ventilation. These differences highlight that not only are these patients an important at-risk group for enhanced morbidity and mortality but also should be considered a group that could contribute to viral spread in the general population. The immunocompromised patients in this study shed virus for a mean of approximately 19 days, likely making them contagious for a significant length of time. Many of these patients were asymptomatic for a significant portion of the time in which they were shedding. Importantly, in a number of these cases the viruses they were shedding had developed drug resistance mutations while maintaining their transmissibility [21, 23], making it possible that these individuals could also be a source for community spread of drug resistant viral strains.",

The prevalence of antiviral drug resistance found in this and other studies is a warning that should not be ignored. Consistent with recent observations, all influenza viruses identified in this study were resistant to at least one class of antiviral. In this group of patients, 4% of viruses were resistant to both major classes of antivirals including some isolates of H3N2 and A(H1N1)pdm09. The majority of these viruses were identified in immunocompromised patients after they had received prolonged courses (beyond 5 days) of antiviral therapy. These data in conjunction with observations that these viruses are transmissible and not attenuated in animal models [21, 23] suggest that the development of multi-drug resistance is a significant concern and that immunocompromised patients may be at risk of acting as hosts for the development and community spread of resistance. Further research, the development of novel therapies, and reevaluation of how immunocompromised individuals are treated for influenza should be undertaken.",
