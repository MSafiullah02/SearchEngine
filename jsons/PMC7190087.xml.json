The use of bedding material for calves can provide comfort, decrease the risk of contracting disease, and reduce stress. Norheim and Simensen (1985) reported that calves kept on elevated, perforated floors had higher IgG than calves kept on a solid floor without bedding. However, when calves were older than 30 d, concentrations of IgG were greatest when calves were kept on the solid floor with use of some bedding.",

Lactating cows preferred to use free-stalls bedded with sand or sawdust compared with mattresses (Tucker et al., 2003). However, temperature and humidity may affect the animal's behavior, quality of bedding materials, and bacteria in the bedding types (Hogan et al., 1989; Bey et al., 2002). In summer, pigs prefer to lie on concrete floors, but in winter they prefer to lie on straw bedding (Fraser, 1985). Lactating cows preferred free-stalls bedded with sand as compared with mattresses in summer; however, cows used stalls bedded with mattresses and sawdust in the winter (Thoreson et al., 2000). Long wheat straw has been used traditionally for calf bedding, but it is expensive or unavailable in many areas. Other reasonably priced materials available in Central Arkansas are granite fines, rice hulls, and wood shavings.",

About 150 female calves were housed in a barn that was 18.3 m wide and 68.6 m long with open sides that were 4.3 m high. Pens (1.2 \u00d7 1.8 m) used during the trial were located in the middle of the calf barn. The trial was conducted from August to October 2002. Physical contact among calves was prevented by 0.6-m spaces between pens or by a wooden wall (1.1 m high) that separated adjoining pens. All pens had plastic buckets for feed and water attached outside the front of the pen. Dirt floors were covered with 2.5 cm (mean weight of 99 kg) of ground limestone (grade 4). Limestone was covered with 5.1 cm of the different types of bedding material composing the 5 treatments. The 5 bedding types were river sand (Lentz Company, Morrilton, AR); granite fines, a by-product of crushing syenite granite rock (Donna Fill Granite Fines, Little Rock, AR); rice hulls (Brinkley Dryer, Brinkley, AR); long wheat straw; or soft wood shavings (Travis Lumber Co., Mansfield, AR). The long wheat straw was delivered baled, and the other materials were delivered loose in bulk. Costs of bedding material (retail price/100 kg) were $0.22 for granite fines, $0.44 for sand, $0.50 for rice hulls, $10 for long wheat straw, and $1.10 for wood shavings. The densities (kg/m3) of the bedding materials were measured to be 1605 for granite fines, 1352 for sand, 92.9 for rice hulls, 69.7 for long wheat straw, and 139.4 for wood shavings. With the exception of wheat straw, these densities represent the weight of materials as they were shoveled into pens to a depth of 5.1 cm. For pens bedded with wheat straw, the straw was torn from the bale in 5.1-cm thick sections, which were laid intact in the pen to cover the floor. These sections were then scattered, and the depth of this loose material exceeded 5.1 cm at the start of the study. Hardness was measured with a DICKEY-john Soil Compaction tester (DICKEY-john Corporation, Auburn, IL) at 3.2 kg/cm2 of pressure with a 6.3-cm diameter disk. Hardness was reported as the centimeters of penetration of the disk into the material; therefore, larger numbers indicate softer materials. Five sites within the pen (approximately 25 cm from each corner and a center point) were measured and averaged before placing the calf in the pen. On d 0, bedding samples were collected to measure DM and absorbency.",

Each calf was identified with an ear tag, and its navel cord was dipped with 10% tincture of iodine (VEDCO, Inc.). No colostrum from the dams was fed to calves. Calves were fed 350 g of a commercial colostrum supplement (Colostrum Plus Bovine IgG-Escherichia coli Antibody; Jorgensen Laboratories, Inc., Loveland, CO) one time only within 6 h of birth by plastic esophageal feeder. Calves were reweighed at 1 d of age to establish an average initial BW. At 1 d of age, calves were randomly assigned to individual pens on 1 of 5 types of bedding materials (12 calves per treatment). Calves began the study over a 4-wk period (3 calves per treatment per week). The week that calves started was used as a block in the statistical models.",

Each morning any orts were removed, weighed, and discarded, and fresh starter was offered. Starter contained a coccidiostat (49.5 mg/ kg as fed; Deccox; Alpharma Animal Health Division, Lowell, AR). Representative samples of feed were taken every 14 d for analysis. Commercial medicated milk replacer and calf starter were analyzed for DM (AOAC, 1990), CP (nitrogen by combustion; Elemental Analyzers for the determination of nitrogen; Elementar Americas, Inc., Mt. Laurel, NJ), and fat (AOAC 920.39C, 1990). Calf starter and milk replacer samples were digested in duplicate by wet ash methodology using concentrated trace metal grade nitric acid in 50-mL conical, trace metal free, polypropylene centrifuge tubes with a heated digestion block (ModBlock, CPI International, Santa Rosa, CA). After digestion, samples were brought to 50 mL volume with a 0.1% cesium chloride solution. Concentrations of Ca were determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy (Perkin-Elmer, model 5000, Norwalk, CT). Concentrations of P were determined with a spectrophotometric procedure (AOAC, 1990) modified for use in microtiter plates. Starter and milk replacer intakes were recorded daily. Calf starter refusals were measured daily in the morning. Milk refusal was measured twice daily. Water was available at all times in an open plastic bucket. Calves were weighed initially and at 1, 2, 4, and 6 wk of age (an average of weights on 2 consecutive d was used for the final BW).",

These subsamples from each pen (from 100 to 140 g of the bedding materials) were composited and placed into sterile plastic bags.

After 3 h, excess water was poured from the sample and a wet weight was obtained (Zehner et al., 1986).

McGuire and Adams (1982) reported that the adequate level of IgG concentration should be greater than 1600 mg/dL. This failure of passive transfer may explain the increased fecal scores during wk 2 and the lower than expected BW gains for calves in the study (Quigley et al., 1995). Colostral IgG concentration is an important factor in the calf's acquisition of passive immunity, and the rate of absorption of IgG increases with increasing colostral IgG concentration. Therefore, feeding double the recommended rate of colostrum using an esophageal tube may reduce the rate of failure of passive transfer (Cabell, 2002). Immunoglobulin G has to be present in the gut to protect calves from viral enteritis during the first 2 wk of age (Snodgrass et al., 1982; Castrucci et al., 1984; Saif and Smith, 1985).",
