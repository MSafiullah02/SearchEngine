This material was then introduced on the arms or legs of the non-immune person, thereby triggering an immune response. This was where Jenner made massive advances -with experiments using cowpox 'pus' on those infected with smallpox. In those days, in the eighteenth century, it was common knowledge amongst farm folk that those afflicted by cowpox never ended up with smallpox. It was reported that Jenner overheard a dairymaid say 7 : \"I shall never have smallpox for I have had cowpox. I shall never have an ugly pockmarked face.\" This lead to Jenner formally testing his theory -Jenner showed that cowpox not only protected against smallpox but also could be transmitted from one person to another as a deliberate mechanism of protection. In spite of being acknowledged worldwide for his work in the field of public vaccination, Jenner remained a humble, interesting and altruistic character. He built a one-room hut in his garden, which he called the 'Temple of Vaccinia' -where he vaccinated the poor for free. 4 Francis Darwin.

His containers were producing sour milk-like liquids instead of alcohol, and he sought help from Pasteur, as he was considered an expert in fermentation. When Pasteur examined the containers, he could detect large amounts of yeast from the vats containing alcohol, but in containers containing the abnormal samples there were cells much smaller than yeast. Pasteur concluded that there are two types of fermentation: caused by alcohol or lactic acid.

For beverages with higher concentrations of alcohol the fermented products must be distilled, as is done with whiskey and other spirits (Scotch is whisky made in Scotland, while bourbon is whiskey made in the U.S.A, generally Kentucky; there is even a Bourbon law -'Federal Standards of Identity' for Bourbon the law stipulates that for a whiskey to call itself bourbon, its mash, the mixture of grains from which the product is distilled, must contain at least 51 % corn, and there are specifications about how this must be distilled).",

If the previous generation of vaccines were using intermediate organisms or unnatural cell types to weaken the disease-causing pathogen, newer vaccine technology using recombinant DNA has found yeast as useful as brewers did. A small piece of DNA is taken from the virus or bacterium that we want to protect against. This is then inserted into the DNA of yeast cells. These yeast cells are then able to produce proteins from the virus, and this is purified and used as the active ingredient -this was method used to produce the vaccine against Human Papillomavirus that is implicated in certain types of genital warts and cervical cancer. Therefore, if the previous ideology behind vaccines was to prevent infectious diseases, we are now looking at 'vaccines' against cancers and non-communicable conditions. The paradigm has shifted from population health to more personalized medicine in the future where high-risk individuals may receive individualized vaccines. Of course, with such measures comes an invariable increase in cost and less democratization. *** Jones and Bartlett, writing about the AIDS Epidemic, loves to quote TIME magazine in 1981 9 : \"(Genetic engineering) \u2026 the most powerful and awesome skill acquired by man since the splitting of the atom.\" But microbiology in particular has always been the forefront of evolution, as the Earth is littered with many different creatures. Unencumbered by size, viruses and bacteria, these little microscopic meddlers keep morphing into new forms and view us merely as companions and co-inhabitors, and not as superiors. Scientists by nature do not make people immediately suspicious that something is out of control, as they wait to study the evidence. The AIDS Epidemic is worth studying to see the response of modern science to ancient evolution. Everyone now generally agrees that SIV (Simian Immunodeficiency Virus) crossed over to man from monkey in the 1940s or 1950s, and this led to new strains of viruses that became HIV.

Essex's team theorized that perhaps the SIV had crossed over into humans via a monkey-bite. About a decade later, Vanessa Hirsh of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases found a strain of SIV almost identical to that of HIV from Sooty Mangabey monkeys in West Africa. What both these researchers discovered was that like humans, viruses are extremely adept at evolutionary experimentation. More recently, in 2010, Preston Marx reported that SIV was prevalent in as many as 40 species of African monkeys for 32,000 years. Evolution is an ancient discipline; human memory and attention is short-lived -this reality is what makes the world perilous for us. In some ways as Laurie Garrett points out in 'The Coming Plague' 10 -we were fortunate with AIDS in that it gave us easy clues that a new organism had emerged: AIDS caused atypical infections (Pneumocystis) or cancers (Kaposi's) rather than the infections found in regular folk; it was first noted in gay men; it was first noted in the USA, a first world country with a highly developed disease control system, and further, scientists had just developed the ability to study retroviruses.",

The vesicular stomatitis virus (one that causes mouth ulcers and is relatively harmless) was genetically altered -a gene for its native envelope glycoprotein was replaced with that from an Ebola virus strain (Zaire, Kikwit 1995). This vaccine had been developed by the Public Health Agency of Canada and it had been patented as early as 2003, even though adequate human trials were not available until recently. Phase III (final stages of efficacy and safety) trials were undertaken in Guinea using 'ring vaccination' -an almost biblical process that involves identifying an infected person, their contacts, and their contacts' contacts and vaccinating them. The vaccine proved 100 % effective -and scientists hailed this as a potential game-changer. The early results, published in The Lancet, showed the vaccine had 100 % effectiveness when given immediately. However, there were 16 cases of Ebola in those that were (in the study) a part of the delayed vaccination group (0.5 %).",

When primitive humans left Africa about 100,000 years ago, our ancestral diets and behaviors did not matter, as they were but a speck on the surface of the Earth. Now we have, within a short space of time overpopulated, polluted and destroyed our environment to the degree that of all organisms to emerge out of Africa, Homo sapiens may indeed be the most dangerous of all. The Earth may be our hermitage -and nature's world may be wonderfully brilliant to behold -but nature is essentially non-discriminatory to color, friends, angels, parents, books or stories -ultimately, only the fingerprints of evolutionary processes matter.

The problem with evolution and Natural Selection was that the process remained aloof from individual needs, solitary cries or quick satisfaction -all things that the vaccination industry seeks to now commercialize. Can intimacy between human and viral DNA end up being dangerous? This was the problem Penn State University Professor, Andrew Read pondered over. In 2001, Read proposed that \"leaky\" vaccines -ones that allow transmission of disease to organisms -might prompt the evolution of more dangerous strains of organisms. Read, an evolutionary biologist stumbled upon experimental evidence that vaccines can alter evolution -organisms we are trying to protect against ending up creating more virulent forms.",

The older, milder strains kill about half of the unvaccinated birds in a couple of months, but the newer \"hot\" strains kill 100 % of infected chickens in 10 days -in other words all unvaccinated birds had no chance of survival. What caused this increase in virulence? Vaccines? To test this theory, he began looking at the population 'fitness' of these organisms -essentially evolutionary 'fitness' is determined by how good a virus is in replicating in different environments. What Read's experiments showed was this -the newer, more deadly or \"hot\" strains were 'not very fit' in unvaccinated birds -in other words if there were no vaccines against Marek's disease, these increasingly virulent forms would die away -the hot strains would burn themselves out by killing their hosts before they had transmitted the infection to other birds. But now, given the hot strain has been rendered fitter by the vaccine, vaccinated birds survive longer and thereby shed more virus -and thereby continue to transmit disease.",

After all, as the American Society of Human Genetics noted, humans share over 90 % of their DNA with their primate cousins. 15 As we sleep, evolution is busy at work tinkering with little enzymes, proteins and genetic code; every time we wake, tiny invisible creatures have become wholer, fitter and more improved.
