In the last decade, respiratory protection has become an increasingly important issue in healthcare as respirators have routinely become an integral component of infection control to protect workers from diseases caused by respiratory pathogens. Healthcare workers are advised to wear NIOSH-certified respirators during close contact with patients with an aerosol-transmitted disease such as tuberculous[2] and measles[3] and during aerosol generating procedures done on patients with influenza[4] and Ebola.[5]",

This table refers to several ASTM standards, but none of the test methods is strictly followed when submitting a 510(k) application to FDA. For example, FDA recommends the use of a whole mask for testing with 0.1 \u00b5m unneutralized PSL aerosol particles for measuring PFE as described by the ASTM F1215-89 standard,[17] which was withdrawn in 1999 and superseded by ASTM F2299 as recommended separately in ASTM F2100. On the contrary, the ASTM F2299 specifies testing SM material with charge neutralized PSL particles in the size range 0.1\u20135.0 \u00b5m at a face velocity in the 0.5\u201325 cm/sec range. In the case of BFE testing, the FDA guidance document recommends either the ASTM F2101 standard, Mil-M369454C or modified Greene and Vesley method.[18] This further complicates comparisons across methods because, ASTM F2101 testing is done with SM material, whereas, Greene and Vesley method uses the entire mask. The FDA guidance document does not clearly specify testing the entire mask or an area of the mask material for BFE testing.\n",

            "text": "The FDA guidance document and the ASTM standards overlook important factors necessary for measuring the filtration efficiency of SMs. The filtration efficiency of fibrous filter materials is controlled by factors including, aerosol charge, particle size distribution, face velocity and filter material charge.[19\u201322] First, charge neutralized aerosol is known to produce maximum penetration (low efficiency).[21,22] FDA refers the ASTM F1215-89 method (presently ASTM F1899) for PFE, but recommends the use of unneutralized PSL aerosol for testing. In the case of BFE, neither the FDA guidance document nor the ASTM F2101 has specified charge neutralization of the S. aureus aerosol. However, the aerosol used in the testing is assumed to be unneutralized. The use of unneutralized aerosol particles for filtration is known to overestimate filtration efficiency. Second, face velocity is another critical factor for filtration efficiency measurement.[23] For the PFE testing, FDA guidance document recommends the ASTM F1215-89 method (presently ASTM F1899), which specifies testing at 5\u201325 cm/sec velocity. Filtration efficiencies at 5 and 25 cm/sec are expected to be different. The variation in PFE results may not be comparable between SMs. FDA guidance document recommends the ASTM F2101 method as one of the BFE testing methods. As per ASTM F2101 method, BFE is tested at 28.3 L/min flow rate, while the area of the filter material is not specified. Testing filter materials with varying surface areas is likely to produce different efficiency values. Above all, the particle size distribution is an important factor when measuring filtration efficiency. The PFE and BFE tests use particles of 0.1 \u00b5m (monodisperse) and 3 \u00b5m mean particle size (MPS), respectively, with no rationale behind those decisions. Many studies show that inert and biological aerosols are captured by similar mechanisms.[24\u201326] The filtration efficiencies are different for various size particles. Particles closer to the most penetrating particle size should be considered for measuring a conservative filtration efficiency. The lack of specific test criteria to obtain a conservative filtration efficiency may produce inconsistent results. The wide variation in test conditions with the entire mask or a portion of mask material at different velocities using different size unneutralized aerosol particles is likely to produce a range of efficiencies for different masks, which is difficult to compare.",

Thus, there is still interest in evaluating respirator filter efficiency using test methods involving a biological aerosol. However, numerous studies show that fibrous filters capture inert and biological aerosols by similar mechanisms.[24,25,27,28] Aerosol particle filtration is dependent on physical characteristics including particle size, shape, density, charge status, filter media charge, and face velocity.]8,29] Whether the particle is \u201cliving\u201d or \u201cinfectious\u201d plays no role in how well it will be collected by a filter.[30] Once a particle is collected it will remain attached by electrostatic and van der Waals' forces,[24] and although biological organisms have no capacity for moving through a filter on their own, a particle may be dislodged at higher air flow rates.[31] Because of this information, Brosseau and Shaffer[32] indicated that it not is necessary to test a respirator filter with a biological aerosol, but rather to focus on \u201cworse-case\u201d type test conditions. When properly selected and used, respirators tested using these types of filter tests should provide expected levels of protection against all types of workplace aerosols.",

NIOSH also sought comparative results for testing with supplemental standard methods vs. test results obtained using the NIOSH NaCl test method. Comments to the docket[33] revealed that no data exist on the comparative filtration efficiency of non-FDA cleared N95 FFRs and that healthcare workers also use non-FDA cleared, NIOSH-approved N95 FFRs (N95 FFRs) for protection against infectious aerosols. Surprisingly, no studies have been published directly comparing filtration efficiency test methods used for NIOSH certification of particulate respirators with those used for FDA clearance of SMs and surgical N95 FFRs.",

The area of other masks tested were different, because the nature of the fabric materials and the construction of some models did not permit the entire mask be tested. Also, it was difficult to fit some masks into the normal sample holders used for some test methods. The surface area of a typical FFR was approximately 150 cm2 as measured manually.

A 2% (wt/vol) NaCl solution was aerosolized, charge neutralized and then passed through the convex side of a test sample properly sealed and placed into a filter holder.

The full NIOSH certification test typically takes approximately 90\u2013100 min to load 200 mg of NaCl aerosol onto the respirator. In this study, we used an abbreviated method in which testing was stopped when the sample reached its maximum penetration level rather that continuing until the respirator was fully loaded with aerosol. Thus, the time to reach maximum penetration was different between different masks, but was typically less than 15 min. A previous study in our laboratory found that efficiencies obtained by measuring initial penetration (average of the first minute) of N95 FFRs were comparable to those done at maximum penetration at full loading conditions.[34] The equipment was programmed to give the percentage filter penetration as shown below:\n Penetration %= Particle  concentration  downstream \u00d7100 Particle  concentration  upstream ",

For \u201cN95 FFRs\u201d, the efficiencies measured by the NIOSH NaCl method were lower than the PFE, BFE, and VFE methods. The NIOSH NaCl method is clearly more conservative compared to the other methods. This was validated by comparing the filtration efficiency obtained by the NIOSH NaCl method with the other methods. The NIOSH NaCl method yielded significantly (p = <0.001) lower efficiency levels than the PFE method for FFRs. This can be explained by the difference in the test conditions including, challenge aerosol size, charge status, and test velocity used between the two methods. Aerosol size is a critical factor for filtration efficiency measurement. The CMD (\u223c0.075 \u00b5m) of NIOSH NaCl aerosols used for NIOSH certification is much closer to the MPPS (0.05 \u00b5m) than the 0.1 \u00b5m size of the PSL particles used in the PFE test method. Penetration increases as the particle size approaches the MPPS. The closer a particle is to the MPPS, the higher the penetration will be.[20] Second, the charge neutralized NaCl particles are expected to show lower filtration efficiency (or higher penetration) than the unneutralized PSL particles. The charge neutralization of challenge aerosol has been shown to increase the penetration (decreased efficiency) of particles.[19,21,22] The higher face velocity (9.3 cm/sec) used in the NIOSH NaCl method is another factor that contributes to the lower filtration efficiencies in comparison to the values obtained by the PFE method at a lower face velocity (3.1 cm/sec). Overall, the results show that the filtration efficiencies measured using the NIOSH NaCl method are more conservative than the values obtained by the PFE method.",

The results can be explained by differences among the test methods. Both the BFE and VFE methods use \u223c3 \u00b5m diameter size particles containing S. aureus and phiX174 bacteriophage, respectively, at a flow rate of 28.3 L/min (face velocity 3.1 cm/sec). The larger diameter size (\u223c3 \u00b5m) particles containing S. aureus and phiX174 bacteriophage is far removed from the MPPS (0.05 \u00b5m) of N95 FFR models and is expected to produce lower penetration or higher efficiencies than the values obtained by the NIOSH NaCl method. It should be noted that the VFE method used \u223c3 \u00b5m droplets, even though the original size of phiX174 is 0.027 \u00b5m. Both, BFE and VFE methods use non-neutralized aerosols at 3.1 cm/sec velocity, which would likely produce relatively higher efficiency values. The test conditions including unneutralized larger aerosol size and lower velocity used in the BFE and VFE methods are relatively less challenging than those conditions used in the NIOSH NaCl method, and yielded higher efficiencies, as expected. The results from the study show that the NIOSH NaCl method is more challenging and produces lower efficiencies than the PFE, BFE and VFE methods.",

In the case of SM models, however, the NIOSH NaCl method showed lower efficiency values (54.72\u201388.40%) than the other methods (97.12\u201399.88%). The results are consistent with those reported previously.[37] In that study, the efficiencies ranged from 10\u201396% for the nine SM models tested using the NIOSH NaCl method. As expected, the results show that the NIOSH NaCl method is more sensitive compared to the other methods. The lower efficiencies for SMs than for FFRs may partly be due to the higher velocity (14.1 vs. 9.3 cm/sec) used for testing. However, previous studies with approximately similar size FFRs and SMs showed significantly higher penetrations or lower efficiencies for SMs.[25,28,38] Products with poor or mediocre filtration performance such as the SM models in this study can be consistently identified using only a more challenging method such as the NIOSH NaCl method used for NIOSH certification of particulate respirators. This confirms earlier reports from other laboratories,[37,39] and ours on SMs,[40] non-NIOSH certified dust masks,[41] and cloth masks.[42]",

The BFE and VFE results for \u201cN95 FFRs\u201d did not show any significant difference indicating that VFE method is not different from BFE method. SMs also showed no difference in BFE and VFE values. VFE could be differentiated from BFE and made more challenging if testing were done using a method to create a smaller aerosol size near the MPPS. Hogan et al. reported that aerosol size distribution is controlled by the properties of the aerosolized liquid and the method of aerosolization, not by the physical size of the virus.[43] For example, in one study, MS2 virus aerosols (\u223c0.05 \u00b5m) showed higher penetrations (lower efficiency) for N95 FFRs.[39] Another study generated an aerosol CMD of \u223c0.1 \u00b5m using viable H1N1 influenza to challenge N95 FFRs.[44] Thus, if there was interest, more challenging VFE methods could be developed by a standards development organization, although a modified VFE with an aerosol challenge in the MPPS range would still be considered unnecessary for determining FFR efficacy as noted previously.[44] The VFE method used in this study is adapted from the ASTM F2101 standard and is not being recognized by standard organizations. VFE method used in this study should not be considered useful for characterizing filter material efficiency. Unfortunately, some manufacturers report VFE for SMs to make marketing claims and it has been used in FDA 510(k) applications.",

Similarly, the models H and B are identical in appearance, except for the labeling and packaging. As shown in Table 3, both pairs exhibited similar filter efficiencies. There was no difference in measured filtration efficiency for BFE and VFE between FFRs that are FDA-cleared (H and I) and NIOSH-certified FFRs and FFRs that are only NIOSH-certified (B and E). Thus, additional tests involving a bioaerosol (e.g., BFE and VFE) included in some FDA 510(k) applications do not add any new information useful to a regulatory or certification agency. Furthermore, this data suggests that non-FDA cleared N95 FFRs would be a viable option for respiratory protection during surgical N95 respirator shortages for situations where fluid resistance[45] and flammability resistance may not be necessary. The increased use of respirators in healthcare facilities can result in a shortage during a pandemic or an outbreak involving a respiratory pathogen.[46-49] Moreover, N95 FFRs are generally less expensive than the surgical N95 FFRs. Manufacturers would prefer to get NIOSH certification and FDA clearance in a single-step process and use of a single filtration test by both agencies would be a positive step towards this objective.",
