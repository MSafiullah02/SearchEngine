The halo sing around nodules and increased vascular margins on the central side of the lesion shared the same underlying pathophysiology. The latter characteristic, additionally, also indicated vascular involvements due to the expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on the cell surface membrane of vascular endothelial cells.

The same trend could also be noticed in reversed halo sign and air bronchogram, corresponding to alveolar septal inflammation and cellular debris in alveolar spaces surrounded by ring-shaped or crescent consolidation. As the disease progresses, the affected area spread more peripherally, forming a parallelism between the pleura and the long axis of the lesion, and more parenchymal bands were noticed, indicating that early inflammation was gradually absorbed and replaced by fibroid recovery along with the disease evolution. Additionally, long axis parallelism may correlate with the virus spreading within alveolar epithelial cells, which diffusely located in the peripheral area and facilitated SARS-CoV2 infusion due to large amount of ACE2 expression on the cellular surface membrane.",
