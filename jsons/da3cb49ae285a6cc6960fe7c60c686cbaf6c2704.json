These included restricting movement of persons in this Region, with the intent of minimising transmission of the virus from infected individuals to healthy ones. The measures introduced have recently been judged courageous and important, although not enough incisive (Remuzzi A and Remuzzi G, 2020) .",

At each visit, the indications for limiting the spread of the infection are explained and illustrated. Home interventions and off-site activities are only provided for urgent situations. The activities involving the patients' family members are reduced to only those deemed essential, and have been replaced by audio or virtual communication. Network activities with external Institutions have been maintained using available communication resources. For new and emergent cases, triage is done over the telephone to understand the urgency of care, and when required, an appointment is scheduled. Over the telephone, triage is also provided for identifying possible medical symptoms or suspected contagion. The work within Residential Psychiatric Facilities continued as normal although external activities were suspended, including home leave and temporary permissions and visits of relatives. Monitoring for respiratory and other Covid-19 symptoms, including temperature, was carried out daily.",

A psychiatric ward was dedicated to Covid-19 positive cases and a protocol for treatment of these patients was implemented. Infectious Diseases Unit carried out an initial assessment, providing therapeutic and diagnostic indications, and daily follow-up consultations with 24 hours availability had been established. Anaesthesia and Intensive Care Units evaluated the patients on hospital admission for eligibility to therapeutic upgrade and were alerted when there was clear evidence of respiratory distress, FR >30 acts/minute, SatO2 <93-92%, or when the PaO2/FiO2 ratio was <300 mmHg on blood gas analysis. Hospitalization in the intensive care unit (ICU) was provided for patients with severe respiratory distress. Among the 15 patients admitted, 3 patients resulted asymptomatic for Covid-19 infection; 4 patients developed symptoms negative for respiratory distress; 8 patients developed bilateral pneumonia, with 4 requiring oxygen therapy.
