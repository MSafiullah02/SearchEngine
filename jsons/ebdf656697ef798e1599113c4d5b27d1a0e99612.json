At this stage, several virulence factors such as fimbriae and outer membrane proteins (OMPs) are involved. 13 P. multocida also fight against host immune systems to enable survival in the host. LPS and the capsule are the major factors during this stage. LPS is one of the stimulators of elements of the immune systems, inducing inflammatory cytokines, including IL-1\u03b1, IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1. 14 As a result, LPS induce endotoxin shock. The capsule evades phagocytosis and complement-mediated lysis. 15 Adherence factors such as pili play a role in adherence to cell surfaces. 1 OMPs also participate in invasion and intracellular survival to evade of host defense. 16, 17 Even though these virulence factors are known, it is still unclear how P. multocida exacerbates pneumonia and whether it helps to create multiple infections.",

In contrast, heat-treated crude extract that was heated to 100\u00b0C for 20 min did not inhibit proliferative activity (data not shown). It was therefore presumed that a heat-labile protein in the crude extract was responsible for suppressing proliferation of Con A-stimulated mouse spleen cells. The crude extract was fractionated using anion exchange chromatography (Figure 1a ). Proteins were eluted using a 0-500 mM NaCl linear gradient. Because the peak of the protein fractions was a broad single peak, inhibitory activity was measured for every third fraction. Inhibitory activity was observed from fraction numbers 21 to 30, eluted at 135.1-195.9 mM NaCl. The inhibitory activity of these fractions was 30.0-56.3%; the other fractions showed no significant inhibitory activity. Thus, these fractions were collected and subjected to cation exchange chromatography (Figure 1b) . Proteins were eluted at 0-600 mM NaCl. The peak of the protein fractions was a broad peak. Fraction numbers 48-57, eluted at 477.9-569.5 mM NaCl, exhibited inhibitory activity of 48.7-84.7%. According to SDS-PAGE, there was one major band at 27 kDa and a few minor bands in these fractions (data not shown). These were further fractionated by hydroxyapatite chromatography. The 27-kDa protein did not bind to the column and was therefore was collected in the flow-through. The molecular weight of the collected protein was approximately 27 kDa according to Coomassie brilliant blue staining (Figure 2 ). The purity of this protein was higher than 95% according to Coomassie brilliant blue and silver staining. This 27-kDa protein was designated as PM27.",

However, it was also possible that PM27 is a larger, known virulence factor that was broken down after production or during the purification process. N-terminal amino acid analysis of PM27 was therefore performed to determine the identity of PM27 and rule out that possibility. BLAST search results indicated that PM27 is the UPase gene from P. multocida. UPases have been identified from prokaryotes to eukaryotes and are known to be key enzymes in the pyrimidine salvage pathway, which catalyzes the reversible phosphorolysis of uridine to uracil and ribose 1-phosphate. 22, 23 However, UPase has not been reported to show antiproliferative activity.
