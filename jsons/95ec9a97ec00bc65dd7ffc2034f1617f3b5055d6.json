Therefore, web search engines typically identify duplicates, either at crawl time, at indexing time, or at retrieval time, in order to remove all but one of them from their search results, showing only the \"best\" version of a piece of content according to some selection criteria.",

With respect to the TREC 2004 Terabyte Track, their research shows (1) that 16 .6% of all relevant documents in submitted runs are content-equivalent, and (2) that the application of the novelty principle causes MAP scores to decrease by 20% on average. This situation is an obstacle to progress, since doing the right thing and filtering duplicates is penalized. Fifteen years have passed since the report by Bernstein and Zobel, and we are curious as to whether anything has changed: Are there still duplicate documents in commonly used benchmarks, and if so, how do they affect the evaluation of retrieval systems? The two contributions of this paper are (1) a reproduction, and (2) an extension and generalization of the work of Bernstein and Zobel on the effects of content-equivalent documents on search engine evaluation. We independently confirm their findings on the TREC 2004 Terabyte Track, using our own reimplementation of their approach. 1 Thus validated, we go on to apply it to a selection of ad hoc retrieval tracks succeeding the one originally studied by Bernstein and Zobel: the Terabyte Track (2004) (2005) (2006) [6, 7, 12] , the Web Track (2009-2014) [8] [9] [10] [11] 13, 14] , and the recent Common Core Track (2017-2018) [1, 2] . Applying the novelty principle causes changes in the evaluation scores of all shared tasks under consideration. These changes do not uniformly spread across participants. A participant who applies the novelty principle independently of others can loose up to 53 positions.",

Retrieval equivalence is determined using a fingerprint function based on selected elements of a standard indexing pipeline: the document string is lowercased, all HTML tags, punctuation, and stop words are replaced by a blank, all remaining words are stemmed, and all white space sequences are collapsed. The resulting string is fed to a cryptographic hash function, and the hash value is used as the document's fingerprint. We reimplement these steps using widespread open-source tools (e.g., Anserini [17] ). Figure 1 shows the results of our analysis.",

Bernstein and Zobel also analyzed its predecessor, the GOV1 corpus, which is why we do so as well. Although efforts were made to remove duplicates during crawling, this did not include retrieval-equivalent documents. As shown in the table in Fig. 1 , 23.39% of the GOV2 documents are equivalent to at least one other document for a total of 794,889 equivalence classes. Our results for both GOV1 and GOV2 deviate by only about 1% from those reported by Bernstein and Zobel (22, 870 and 865,362 classes, respectively), which, given the corpus sizes, is sufficiently close to say that their experiment can be successfully reproduced. This is further corroborated by the fact that the plot of the distribution of class sizes for GOV2, by visual inspection, has the same characteristics as that of Bernstein and Zobel. The observed differences are due to the lacking descriptions in the original paper of the normalization steps of the fingerprint function. Asking the authors for details was deemed unnecessary given the closeness of fit. Although the organizers of this track took note of the work of Bernstein and Zobel, they did not report on any activities to reduce the impact of near-duplicates [6, 12] .",

For the threshold reported by Bernstein and Zobel, we achieved only a precision of 87% on our sample under our interpretation of content equivalence. We hence chose the threshold 0.68 for GOV2 documents, 0.84 for generic ClueWeb pages, and 0.68 for news articles to obtain a precision of 0.95 for all three text genres. Given the threshold difference we obtained for the GOV2 documents, we compared all 50 topics of the Terabyte Track 2004 in detail with the results reported by Bernstein and Zobel and found only two with discrepancies; a reasonable result given the difficulty of repeating a user study.",

The impact of the novelty principle on the ranking of retrieval-systems under the scenarios that: (1) content-equivalent documents are marked as irrelevant, (2) content-equivalent documents are removed by the search engine. We report the average nDCG (avg nDCG ), the median (medI ) and maximum (maxI ) ranking changes of the ideal participation model, changes in the average nDCG (\u0394nDCG), as well as Kendall's \u03c4 , and Kendall's \u03c4 of the top-5 systems (\u03c4 @5). We experiment with two strategies to model the novelty principle: local judgment manipulation as per Bernstein and Zobel, and a global judgment manipulation of our own design. In local judgment manipulation, judgments are manipulated for each run independently, so that a document that is content-equivalent to another document is judged irrelevant if the latter appears above in a search results list. Bernstein and Zobel employ only local judgment manipulation, which does not consistently implement the novelty principle.",

In local judgment manipulation, all documents of that class are considered relevant for that ranking, whereas this is not the case for an alternative ranking that contains all documents of that class, where only one of them would be relevant. To resolve this contradiction, we propose a global judgment manipulation in which all documents of the same equivalence class-except for a representative document-are marked as irrelevant for a query. If a ranking contains documents of a relevant equivalence class, we apply the local judgment manipulation to choose the representative document. Otherwise, we chose a representative at random. In all our experiments, local manipulation amplified score changes compared to global manipulation.",

We hence also analyze the novelty principle's impact on nDCG scores, observing much greater changes in MAP scores than for nDCG. Due to space limitations, we only discuss the novelty principle's impact on nDCG scores under global manipulation; a reproduction of the MAP-based analysis is included in our accompanying repository (see link above). Table 1 shows the impact of the novelty principle on all considered tracks. Regarding the Terabyte Track 2004 (column group \"Equiv. irrelevant\"), we observe a reduction \u0394 nDCG of the avg nDCG by 5.1% from 0.425 to 0.403. This reduction may be ignored if it were rank-preserving with respect to the ranking of the participating systems. The original ranking of systems correlates to the cleansed one with 0.96 Kendall's \u03c4 . This seems acceptable, but we measure only 0.8 \u03c4 @5, regarding only the top five ranks; the best-performing systems are affected more strongly. We inspected how many ranks an \"ideal system\" I would drop, if it were the only one to remove content-equivalent documents from its rankings: In the median, it would drop 9 ranks (med I ) and in the worst case 19 (max I ). By contrast, if all systems had removed content-equivalent documents from their rankings/runs (column group \"Equiv. removed\"), the novelty principle's impact on the Terabyte Track 2004 would have been negligible. No ranking changes among the best-performing five systems occur, and the rank correlation of all systems increases to 0.98. Interestingly, even the average nDCG would have increased by 0.3%, caused by the fact that each run is only expected to return one document of a class of relevant content-equivalent documents under global judgment manipulation.",
