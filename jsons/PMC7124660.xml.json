OVM is a highly glycosylated protein containing sialic acid (SA), which belongs to the mucin family [1]. Mucins are a major component of mucus, which are widely distributed in the body's internal surface and mucosal tissues, such as the respiratory tract and intestines. They provide an important innate immune barrier to potential toxins, particles, and pathogens [2]. It can prevent pathogens from being in contact with susceptible cells. It is thought that the adhesion of mucins to pathogens is an important mechanism with a potentially significant effect.",

The interaction of HA on the surface of the virus with OVM leads to the release of glycopeptide complexes. Hemagglutination inhibition assays and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays have revealed the high affinity of OVM for bovine rotavirus, chicken new castle disease virus and human influenza virus [[4], [5], [6]]. It was found that N-acetylneuraminic acid (NeuAc, a specific subtype of sialic acid in OVM) in the \u03b2-subunit could greatly facilitate the interaction between OVM and chicken new castle disease virus. The alteration of the conformation of OVM by the alkylation of disulfide bonds leads to loss of binding to OVM antibody [4]. However, evaluations of antiviral activity in these studies focused primarily on the inhibition of viral-induced hemagglutination and did not include other more accurate and intuitive antiviral methods.",

Meanwhile, various viruses such as influenza virus, coronavirus and rotavirus utilize glycoproteins containing sialic acid on the surface of host cells as recognition receptors [[14], [15], [16]]. Sialic acid can be recognized by the epitope on the globular head of the influenza virus HA, thereby inducing interaction with the corresponding HA receptor binding sites and interfering with or blocking the adsorption of the virus to the cells [17]. Sialic acid residues are generally located at the terminus of the N-linked oligosaccharide chain and the O-linked oligosaccharide chain with \u03b12,3-, \u03b12,6- and \u03b12,8-linkages [18]. Different influenza viruses are capable of specifically recognizing different linked types of sialic acids. Human influenza viruses are more likely to bind to the \u03b12,6-linkage sialic acid receptor, and avian influenza viruses preferentially recognize \u03b12,3-linkage sialic acids [19,20].",

The endogenous fluorescence spectra of OVM before and after removing the terminal sialic acid at excitation wavelengths of 274 nm and 295 nm were shown in Fig. 5B and C, respectively. As shown in the Tyr fluorescence spectrum of Fig. 5B, removal of terminal sialic acid results in enhancement of the endogenous fluorescence intensity of OVM, but no obvious migration of the fluorescence peak occurs. The fluorescence spectra of Trp was in Fig. 5C. The overall trend in fluorescence intensity agrees with the result of Tyr being a fluorescent probe. However, the \u03bbmax of the Trp spectrum was blueshifted after removing the terminal sialic acid, suggesting that after removal of sialic acid, the OVM microenvironment hydrophobicity is enhanced. In order to verify this result, the changes in the ANS fluorescence spectra of OVM before and after the removal of terminal sialic acid were investigated by an ANS fluorescence probe.",

According to our previous research, OVM contains plenty of sialic acid, and its subtype is NeuAc. In this study, we demonstrated the glycosidic bond type of sialic acid linking the OVM carbohydrate chain terminus, which contains both \u03b12-6- and \u03b12-3-linkages. The content of sialic acid with the \u03b12-6-linkage was higher than that with the \u03b12-3-linkage (Fig. 1B). In the process through which the influenza virus infects the body, the first step is to recognize and bind to the cell surface receptor through the viral surface protein HA [20]. The main receptors are cell surface glycoconjugates, and sialic acid is required for this process. Human influenza viruses mainly recognize \u03b12-6-linked sialic acids, whereas avian influenza viruses prefer \u03b12-3-linked sialic acids [31,32]. Therefore, due to the type of sialic acid linkages in the OVM oligosaccharide chain, we believe that OVM has anti-infective activity against both human and avian influenza viruses. Furthermore, the anti-avian influenza virus function is closely related to \u03b12-3-linked sialic acid.",

Using the HA of influenza viruses H5N1 and H1N1 as the binding protein, the changes in OVM as an acceptor with or without sialic acid binding HA were measured. Firstly, the interaction of OVM before and after removing sialic acid with its antibody was analyzed, and it was found that sialic acid was not the binding site. No significant difference was found in the binding activity before and after the removal of sialic acid. This demonstrates that sialic acid does not participate in all the functions of OVM but also that follow-up experiments can use an ELISA reaction between OVM and an antibody. This ensures that the results are real and effective. Subsequently, the interaction of natural OVM and dSA-OVM with HA was investigated, and no binding reaction between HA and BSA was found, which indicated that the recognition of glycoprotein was specific (Fig. 2). However, the obvious interaction between HA and natural OVM indicates that HA can specifically recognize OVM and associate with it. On the other hand, the binding of OVM to HA was significantly reduced after sialic acid removal to only 30% to 40% of the original (Fig. 2). These results showed the same tendency in H5N1 and H1N1, which proves that sialic acid is involved in the recognition of HA and OVM. After sialic acid was removed, this binding could be inhibited. Thus, we demonstrate that one of the antiviral activity mechanisms of OVM is associated with sialic acid in the OVM oligosaccharide chain competing with the cellular receptor for binding HA. After removing sialic acid, OVM still retains some ability to bind HA, presumably through other recognition mechanisms. In fact, sialic acid was not completely removed after enzymatic hydrolysis (Fig. 1B). Therefore, this binding may be associated with sialic acid residues, and the role of sialic acid in this mechanism may be underestimated.",

To determine whether Gal, Fuc, Man and free sialic acid could bind with HA, we conducted competition experiment. The results show that after adding of these free sugars first, the binding of OVM and HA was not significantly different and basically maintained at the same level. It suggests that these carbohydrates are not involved in binding and cannot prevent this interaction. Monomeric sialic acid is thought to be unable to compete effectively with the receptor on target cells for binding to influenza virus, while dendritic sialic acid structure is more effective against influenza virus [33]. The process by which influenza virus recognizes sialic acid is strongly related to its linked pattern [14,19,34,35]. This is similar to the finding that free sialic acid does not effectively bind with HA in this study (Fig. 3).",

            "text": "Sialic acid is a highly electronegative sugar molecule, and the role in OVM is worth in-depth exploration. For this reason, we designed the influence of free sialic acid on the interaction between OVM and HA under different sequences of addition. When OVM was added firstly and then free sialic acid, there was no significant change in the binding of OVM with HA, and the interaction remained at the same level as the control. However, it was exciting to note that when OVM was preincubated with free sialic acid, its binding to HA was significantly enhanced compared to the control. It had the same effect on H5N1 and H1N1 (Fig. 4). Sialic acid in OVM was involved in the recognition of HA. Free sialic acid does not directly bind to HA but mixed with OVM can effectively improve the interaction. Sialic acid is electronegative and carries multiple O atoms and N atoms that can have many unique physicochemical effects [27,36]. Taken together, this study proposes a novel mechanism hypothesis that sialic acid plays an active role in the antiviral activity of OVM (Fig. 6\n). First, sialic acid in the OVM carbohydrate chain is recognized by the influenza virus HA as a receptor [37]. On the other hand, free sialic acid is not directly involved in HA binding, but it can bind OVM to form an eupolymer by electrostatic interaction or hydrogen bond [38], promote OVM to bind and co-precipitate with HA. Therefore, OVM maintain effective defense against virus, and enhance its antiviral activity. In a future study, this hypothesis will be explored in vitro and in cell experiments.",

The hemagglutinin of the influenza virus recognizes and binds to the ovomucin carbohydrate chain terminal sialic acid, and the interaction is greatly diminished after the sialic acid is removed. Therefore, sialic acid is an important recognition site for ovomucin to play a role in the binding of hemagglutinin competing with host cell surface receptors. At the same time, the removal of ovomucin sialic acid lead to a slight increase in the random coil of secondary structure and enhance surface hydrophobicity. We also found a unique role for free sialic acid. The addition of free sialic acid can promote the binding of ovomucin to hemagglutinin and enhance ovomucin anti-influenza virus activity. This in-depth study and exposition can complement the mechanism of ovomucin involved in innate immunity and provide new ideas and perspectives for the development of anti-virus agents.",
