No significant difference was found in clinical manifestations except wheezing when comparing patients with a single HAdV\u2010virus infection and patients with a HAdV coinfection. Variables including age, wheezing, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, supplemental oxygen requirement, severe pneumonia, and the length of hospital stay (LOS; required \u2265 7 days) were entered into the multivariate analyses, and wheezing and duration of hospitalization greater than or equal to 7 days were associated with HAdV coinfection (odds ratio [OR], 1.82; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.063\u20103.116; P = 0.029 and OR, 1.98; 95% CI, 1.179\u20103.337; P = 0.01, respectively).",

The distribution of HAdV types attained epidemic proportions, lasting 2 or 3 years in each cycle.6, 34, 35, 36 HAdV\u20103 and HAdV\u20107 infections were the major prevalent HAdV infections among hospitalized children in Hunan (Southern China), similar to reports from Korea,6 Argentina,34 and Chongqing (China),15, 16 but in contrast to reports from Malaysia,37 Israel,38 and Hong Kong.5 In the current study, HAdV\u20103 infection epidemics were sustained for three years (2008\u20102010). The significant increase in HAdV\u20107 infection between 2010 and 2011 represents an undetected outbreak in local children, which is consistent with the reported outbreaks in Chongqing (China).15, 16 However, in provinces of mainland China, such as Hangzhou30 and Jiangsu,35 most respiratory disease outbreaks were associated with HAdV\u20103 infection. From 2012 to 2014, HAdV\u20107 was the dominant HAdV infection type in Hunan. HAdV\u20103 and HAdV\u20107 infections result in severe pneumonia, and HAdV\u20107 infection is found in children at a young age and results in epidemic outbreaks with high mortality and severe sequelae.6, 17, 18 Studies from the United States (2004\u20102006) suggest that HAdV\u20107 infection has not been implicated to have a strong association with severe morbidity possibly because of a stabilization of circulating HAdV\u20107 genotypes in the United States, as was recently apparent in Iowa for the adenovirus type 7d2 strain, with subsequent increases in herd immunity and reductions in HAdV\u20107 infections.23 A Korean (1997\u20102007) report suggested that the intensity of outbreaks caused by HAdV\u20107 decreased markedly and did not circulate endemically. Because the HAdV\u20107 genome types were relatively limited in Korea, stabilization of the circulating HAdV\u20107 genome types and the subsequent increase in herd immunity might have resulted in the decline of HAdV\u20107 activity in Korea.39 By contrast, HAdV\u20107 infection is a major cause of LRTIs in children in China.32 There was a high frequency of infection of HAdV\u20107 and HAdV\u20103 in pediatric pneumonia in Chongqing and Beijing, and HAdV\u20107 infection was associated with a higher incidence of severe pneumonia,15, 40 which reinforces the findings of the current study.",

Similar to our findings, Foulongne et al reported that the hospital stay increased in hMPV/RSV coinfected children compared with those infected by one type of virus.43 However, some studies have reported that there are no clinical differences between patients with respiratory infections caused by one type of agent and those caused by multiple viruses detected in NPAs from hospitalized children.44, 45 From an empirical point of view, it might be logical to expect that infection with two or more types of viruses could aggravate the severity of illness; we believe that studies should focus on dual versus multiple infections as the different characteristics of the virus can cause a bias when analyzing the results. One report has indicated that the detection of viral load in respiratory specimens may be helpful for possible progress in identifying the true respiratory pathogen and may serve as an important clue to determine the virus that may have a greater influence on the clinical severity of the illness in a mixed infection.46 As a result, further studies are needed.",
