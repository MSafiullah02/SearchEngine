ASF has spread into a number of countries in Africa, Europe, and Asia during the past decade, with the possibility of further expansion1,3. The causative agent, ASF virus (ASFV), is a large double-stranded DNA virus belonging to the family Asfarviridae2,4,5. Due to the lack of vaccine and effective treatments against ASFV, disease control mainly relies on culling pigs1,4. More than 30 million domestic pigs were culled in the past 2 years, and the number continues to increase6. Thus, rapid diagnosis of the ASFV-affected animal is crucial to prevent its broad expansion, and to reduce economic losses7,8.",

Although virus isolation is the gold standard to diagnose ASFV, this time-consuming and complicated procedure is not applicable for real-time monitoring diseases11. Detection of ASFV antigen enables testing samples on a large scale, but it is not sensitive enough in detecting early-stage infection8. Both quantitative PCR (qPCR) and conventional PCR are fast and sensitive methods for detecting ASFV9,11\u201313. However, PCR methods require skilled operation and thermocyclers, making them less suitable for the field applications14. Isothermal amplification allows for easier operation and rapid amplification of DNA at a constant temperature independent of lab instruments8,15\u201318. However, nonspecific DNA amplification and high false-positive rates remain a big concern15. Therefore, a specific, sensitive, rapid, and equipment\u2010free assay is urgently demanded for monitoring ASFV in the field.",

Some Cas proteins, including Cas12a, Cas12b, Cas13a, and Cas14, exhibit noncanonical trans-cleavage activity (alternative name \u201ccollateral effect\u201d)21\u201324. Upon activation via recognizing a specific target sequence, these proteins exhibited the collateral effect by cleaving nontarget sequences21\u201324. Cas13a, an RNA-guided RNA endonuclease, gets activated via binding with sequence-specific RNA substrates. Activated Cas13a developed its nonspecific ribonuclease activity to degrade nearby single-stranded RNAs23. By combining the trans-cleavage activity of Cas13a with isothermal amplification and in vitro transcription of DNA to RNA, Cas13a\u2010based platform enables detection of nucleic acid at attomolar sensitivity25. When engineered with lateral flow for visual readout, it can generate a portable, rapid, and sensitive detection platform26,27. However, the in vitro transcription process is time-consuming, and the RNA probe used in the assay is unstable and expensive, limiting its broad applications. Cas12a, an RNA-guided DNA endonuclease, recognizes dsDNA, and upon activation, exhibits its nonspecific single stranded DNA (ssDNA) endonuclease activities21,28. Combining the collateral effect of Cas12a with isothermal amplification and a fluorescence readout has created a rapid and specific detection platform21. Cas12a-based detection assay is more straightforward than Cas13a, and its DNA probe is more stable and cost-effective. However, the fluorescence readout of Cas12a-based assay requires lab instruments. According to a recent report, the detection signal can be observed by naked eye under blue light29. This procedure is not suitable for detection in the field, as it requires a centrifuge, and its signal can be interfered in biological samples.",

It is critical to establish a single crRNA strategy that monitors most ASFV subtypes via the CRISPR-based detection9,11\u201313. To achieve this goal, we designed six crRNAs by either targeting the conserved regions of polyprotein pp220 (briefly as pp220) or DNA polymerase gene (DNA Pol), both of which are essential to ASFV life cycle2,5 (Supplementary Table S1). The ability to specifically cleave pp220 or DNA Pol double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) sequences by Cas12a\u2013crRNA complex was demonstrated by in vitro cleavage activity assay (Supplementary Fig. S1). To confirm the trans-effect of Cas12a after target recognition, a ssDNA, FAM-Quencher reporter, was designed and synthesized (FAM-TTATT-Quencher, as ssDNA-FQ reporter). Upon ssDNA cleavage by Cas12a, the FAM signal is released and measured. The assay showed little background when the ssDNA-FQ reporter is intact (Supplementary Fig. S2a, b). When DNA Pol or pp220 dsDNA sequences were presented, the crRNA1-targeted DNA Pol and crRNA5-targeted pp220 outperformed other crRNAs in terms of fluorescence intensity and activity kinetics (Fig. 1a, b). Therefore, crRNA1 targeting DNA Pol and crRNA5 targeting pp220 were selected for further experiments.",

To further investigate whether Cas12a-based fluorescence detection could tolerate point mutation, a series of 1-nt mutations were introduced into the target DNA. Consistent with the 2-nt mutation data, we observed a much reduced fluorescence signal in the point mutation of 17 nucleotides next to PAM, and the point mutation of the PAM-distal 18\u201320 still showed substantial fluorescence signal (Supplementary Fig. S3a, b).

Both DNA pol crRNA1 and pp220 crRNA5 showed a high and specific fluorescence signal against ASFV, whereas other pathogen viruses triggered few signals (Fig. 3a, b). Since it is possible that veterinary samples are contaminated by human viruses, we put the guide sequences of crRNA1 and crRNA5 in nucleotide BLAST, and analyzed the top comparison results. All viruses other than ASFV from the analysis showed less than 60% sequence similarity, suggesting low target sequence similarity of swine and human viruses (Supplementary Table S2).

Given the rapid spread and highly contagious characteristics of ASFV, it is crucial to develop a real-time detection method that can monitor ASFV in the field, and be operated by farmers. We combined recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) technique and the lateral flow detection technique to replace the instrument-dependent PCR amplification technology and fluorescence detection method. RPA allows rapid amplification independent of the instrument, whereas the lateral flow detection allows visual readout of test results. We optimized the primers of RPA to make it robust (Supplementary Table S3). The lateral flow detection technique was described as the following. Au nanoparticles conjugated with an anti-FITC antibody were on the binding pad. The streptavidin and IgG were fixed on the NC membrane, as a control line to specifically bind biotin, and test line to specifically bind an anti-FITC antibody, respectively. The FAM-Biotin ssDNA reporter specifically bound to Au nanoparticles to form a complex because FAM can be recognized by the anti-FITC antibody on the Au nanoparticles. When ssDNA was not degraded by Cas12a, this complex bound to streptavidin at the control line. On the contrary, when ssDNA was degraded to cause Biotin release from the complex, the complex could pass through the control line, and bound to the IgG antibody on the test line. When we applied the concentration of reporters used in fluorescence assay for lateral flow detection, an obvious false-positive band was shown in blank control (Fig. 5a). We believed that a portion of nanoparticles did not bind to the FAM-Biotin ssDNA reporter; thus, they kept moving forward until they reached the test band to make the potential false-positive result. Various concentrations of FAM-Biotin ssDNA reporter were added. A higher concentration of FAM-Biotin ssDNA reporter gradually diminished the false-positive band (Fig. 5a). Thus, we chose 1 \u03bcM as the concentration of reporter for the next set of experiments. When we used the concentration of LbCas12a/crRNA complex used in fluorescence assay for lateral flow detection, the test band appeared in positive samples (Supplementary Fig. S4). However, the band was fuzzy despite the extended reaction time. When we increased the concentration of LbCas12a/crRNA complex, the test band was striking in positive samples, but it was not shown in negative samples (Supplementary Fig. S4). To examine the optimal reaction time and temperature of Cas12a-based lateral flow, we compared reaction times of 1, 2, 5, and 10 min, and reaction temperature of 4 \u00b0C, room temperature and 37 \u00b0C. We identified that 1- or 2-min reaction time was sufficient to observe a clear test band, and the reaction at room temperature showed a clearer band than at 4 and 37 \u00b0C (Supplementary Fig. S5).",

A clear positive band started to present at 2 \u00d7 102 copies, suggesting that the detection limit is as low as 200 copies of viral genome (Fig. 5b). This is very similar to the detection limit of qPCR-based approach (Supplementary Fig. S6), showing that an engineered instrument-free CRISPR-based strip assay has comparable sensitivity to the instrument-dependent method. To determine whether using multiple crRNAs could increase the sensitivity, DNA Pol crRNA1 and pp220 crRNA5 were used simultaneously in one reaction. The detection limit remained as 2 \u00d7 102 copies (Supplementary Fig. S7). Thus, we kept using crRNA1 for the following experiments. To determine the accuracy of the assay, 30 veterinary samples collected from blood, oral, or anal swabs were tested. Consistent with qPCR results, all negative samples showed the control band only in the strip, and all positive samples showed both control and test bands (Fig. 5c and Table 1).

CRISPR\u2013Cas systems are revolutionary tools allowing for precise genome engineering, transcription regulation, and many other applications31\u201333. The trans-activity of several class 2 Cas endonucleases allows sensitive and robust detection of nucleic acids21\u201324.

In combination with isothermal amplification, we found that Cas12a was able to detect ASFV with high sensitivity and precision. It is possible that other members of Cas12 family can also be used for ASFV detection. Cas12b-mediated DNA detection was recently developed, and it showed higher sensitivity than Cas12a on several examined sequences34.

The stringent system may assure that it does not cross-react with other swine pathogens. Indeed, when tested with five other common swine pathogens, none of them showed any fluorescence signal (Fig. 3). It is useful to understand the mutation frequencies of the DNA Pol and pp220 genes, particularly their conservative regions for precise detection of ASFV. However, this information was rarely reported, and further investigations are demanding36,37.",

However, a fluorescence reporter was used in the study, which restricted its application in the laboratories21. A recent study developed a blue light-based readout29. Though this readout does not rely on laboratory equipment, it is less applicable in the field. We aimed to develop a strip-based, high-sensitivity assay to detect ASFV independent of lab instruments. We noticed that the conditions of Cas12a fluorescent assay cannot be directly applied for strip detection (Fig. 5). After a thorough optimization of various parameters, we successfully generated a robust strip-based assay to fulfil the detection potential of Cas12a (Fig. 5). The sensitivity of this assay is as low as 200 copies/sample, which is comparable as qPCR assay executed in laboratories (Fig. 5; Supplementary Fig. S6). The low detection limit of the assay allows the diagnosis of ASF at the early stage of infection38. It is more sensitive and accurate than other field-applicable assays, which are usually based on isothermal amplification alone11. The strip can be kept in dry environment at 4 \u00b0C for at least 3 months, as previously reported, making it suitable for commercial use39\u201341.",

To overcome this limitation, we successfully engineered a homemade strip using gold nanoparticle\u2013antibody conjugate (named as Cas-gold). For the homemade version of strips, all parts were completed by hand. Because the detection line was made with multiple microspots, the strips had more smear bands than commercial ones. In the commercial production, this step can be completed by professional equipment to avoid this issue. Nevertheless, we showed that the homemade strip exhibited comparable results to the commercial strip (Fig. 6). Homemade strip provides a robust, easy, and cost-effective alternative.

The RPA mixture was mixed with 150 ng of LbCas12a, 18 ng of crRNA, 1 \u03bcM ssDNA (FAM-TTATT-Biotin) reporter, and 2 \u03bcL of NEBuffer 2.1. After 90 min of incubation, 160 \u03bcL of HybriDetect assay buffer was added, and the strips were inserted.",

After continuous stirring for 30 min, the reaction system was cooled to room temperature to obtain a stable colloidal gold suspension. Subsequently, the size of Au NPs was detected by dynamic light scattering. To further prepare the Au NP\u2013antibody conjugate, NaOH solution was used to adjust the pH of Au NP suspension, and the anti-FITC antibody was added. After stirring for 1 hour at 37 \u00b0C, the bovine serum albumin (BSA) solution (0.1%, w/v) was added, and the Au NP\u2013antibody conjugates were collected by centrifugation. The immunologic test strips were composed of a sample pad, a conjugate pad, an antibody pad, a NC membrane, and an adaptive backing card46. Briefly, the conjugate pad was dripped with appropriate amounts of Au NP\u2013antibody conjugate suspension, and then dried for 1 hour at 37 \u00b0C. The streptavidin and nonspecific capture antibody (IgG) were dripped into the NC membrane to form control and test bands. The NC membrane was dried for 1 hour at 37 \u00b0C, and then was immersed in BSA solution (1%, w/v) to passivate the unbound sites, and dried for 1 hour at 37 \u00b0C. The sample pad, reconcile pad, NC membrane, and absolute pad were assembled on the adaptive backing card to form complete immunochromographic test strips.",
