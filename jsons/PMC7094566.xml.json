Since its discovery in 2000, ACE2 has been implicated in heart function (Crackower et al., 2002), hypertension and diabetes (Tikellis et al., 2003). Unexpectedly, it was very recently identified as a functional receptor for the coronavirus (CoV) that causes the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), serving as the cellular entry point for the SARS virus (Li et al., 2003). The receptor is therefore a prime target for pathogenesis and pharmacological intervention.",

            "text": "SARS, an acute pulmonary syndrome characterized by an atypical pneumonia that results in progressive respiratory failure and death in close to 10% of infected individuals, is responsible for the first pandemic of the 21st century (Peiris et al., 2003). SARS-CoV spreads mainly via the respiratory route (Ksiazek et al., 2003, Drosten et al., 2003, Kuiken et al., 2003, Fouchier et al., 2003), and the lungs are the main targets (Ding et al., 2003). The spike protein of the coronavirus (a surface glycoprotein) mediates coronavirus entry into receptor-bearing cells, after which viral replication begins in the cytoplasm (Li et al., 2003). Interestingly, the epidemiologic data of SARS suggested that there was an obvious predominance of young adult patients in SARS attacks. The largest outbreak of SARS struck Beijing in spring 2003 and about 2521 cases of probable SARS occurred. Attack rates were highest in those 20\u201339 years of age (mean age 33), which account for 53.0% (Liang et al., 2004). The age-specific attack rates of SARS were supported by other outbreaks of SARS (Zhao et al., 2003, Lee et al., 2003, Hsu et al., 2003, Poutanen et al., 2003, Booth et al., 2003). Some of these data also showed a slight female proneness for SARS attacks. It seems likely that aging and gender might be implicated in SARS infection susceptibility. Thus, it can be hypothesized that age- or gender-related difference of ACE2 expression in lung tissue might contribute to different pathological processes in SARS-CoV attacks.",

Recent studies in an autopsy series using viral isolation, culture techniques, and in situ hybridization showed that SARS-CoV is present in alveolar epithelial cells and, to a lesser extent, macrophages and bronchial epithelial cells (To et al., 2004). The localization of ACE2 protein in human lung was detected very recently (Hamming et al., 2004). The results from the present study are consistent with the previous findings about SARS pathology and the coronavirus histological distribution. But in our study ACE2 content in alveolar epithelial cells and bronchial epithelial cells are similar, while Hamming et al. identified that ACE2 content was weak in bronchial epithelial. Interestingly, compared with the smooth muscle cells of pulmonary vessels, there was no obvious positive deposits are detected in the bronchial smooth muscle cells. High levels of ACE2 are seen in endothelial cells, but viral infection has not been demonstrated extensively in these cells of human tissues in previous studies (Ding et al., 2003). These differences might be a clue for disclosing the severe vasculitis without equivalent bronchiolar inflamma tion in SARS pathology. We could postulate that the efficiency of the virus replication is distinct in different respiratory cell types although the contents of ACE2 in these cell types are similar.",

The largest outbreak of SARS struck Beijing in spring 2003 and about 2521 cases of probable SARS occurred. Attack rates were highest in those 20\u201339 years of age (mean age 33), which account for 53.0% (Liang et al., 2004). The age-specific attack rates of SARS in Beijing support findings from other outbreaks of SARS. The mean age of affected patients is 28 years in Guangzhou (190 cases) (Zhao et al., 2003), 39 years in Hongkong (138 cases) (Lee et al., 2003) and 28 years in Singapore (20 cases) (Hsu et al., 2003), whereas it was 45 years (154 cases) in Canada (Poutanen et al., 2003, Booth et al., 2003). The patients enrolled in the former 4 reports are all Chinese ethic, which might be related to the slight discrepancy between the data from Asia and from Canada. But the total tendency is obvious that age might be an independent factor for the risk of susceptibility to SARS. Considering that ACE2 serves as the cellular entry point for the SARS virus, age-related difference of ACE2 expression might be related to the highest attack rates in the young adult. However, it is inconsistent with the high mortality in old patients in these reports. But the entry of virus into the alveolar pneumocytes in the lung is only at the dawn of our understanding of the pathogenesis of SARS, there are so many unknown factors taking part in the process.",
