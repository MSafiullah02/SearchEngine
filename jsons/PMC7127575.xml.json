Her past health was unremarkable except for some vitiligo over the neck and back which was treated with topical steroid. Though her antinuclear antibody titre was over 640, there is no evidence of autoimmune disease activity as evident by negative anti-double stranded DNA antibody and normal complement levels. On 17th November 2013, she travelled to Shenzhen, China, where she visited a live poultry market. On 21st November, she developed malaise. Subsequently, she developed fever since 23rd November, associated with cough, sputum production, sore throat and dyspnoea. She did not have vomiting or diarrhoea. She was hospitalized on 27th November. On admission, her body temperature was 40.0 \u00b0C. Her respiratory rate was 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation was 97% while breathing ambient air. The pulse rate was 116 beats per minute, and the blood pressure was 120/63 mmHg. Her chest radiograph showed right lower zone consolidation and blunting of right costophrenic angle. Her condition deteriorated rapidly despite intravenous amoxicillin-clavulanate 1.2 g every 8 h and oral azithromycin 500 mg every 24 h given from day 1\u20132 after hospitalization. She also received one dose of oral oseltamivir 75 mg on day 2 after hospitalization. Serial chest radiographs showed progression to bilateral lower zone consolidation. She subsequently required intubation and positive pressure ventilation on day 2 after hospitalization. With further deterioration and the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was started on day 3 after hospitalization. After the diagnosis of A(H7N9) was confirmed, she was started on intravenous zanamivir 600 mg every 12 h from day 5 after hospitalization. On day 3 after hospitalization, complete blood picture showed a lowish white cell count of 3.7 (normal >3.9) \u00d7 109/L (neutrophil 2.7 and lymphocyte 0.9[normal >1.1]) and a platelet count of 131 \u00d7 109/L (normal >150). The coagulation profile was deranged with a prothrombin time of 15.4 (normal <13.5) seconds and an activated partial thromboplastin time of 42 (normal <33.7) seconds. The plasma creatine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase peaked at 1976 (normal <161) and 990 (normal <218) U/L respectively. Urine for myoglobin was positive.

The NA gene was most closely related to influenza A(H2N9) and A(H11N9) viruses of wild birds from Hong Kong and mainland China. The internal genes MP, NP, NS, PA, PB1 and PB2 were most closely related to avian A(H9N2) viruses circulating in the domestic poultry of China. In earlier studies comparing human A(H7N9) isolates obtained from patients in spring 2013, it was found that the internal genes appeared to come from multiple sources.21, 24 The PB2 gene of the human A(H7N9) strains isolated during spring and early summer of 2013 clusters closely together.22, 23 To monitor the evolution of the A(H7N9) virus, we have analysed the genomic sequence of the A(H7N9) virus (A/Hong Kong/470129/2013) causing severe pneumonia in a 36-year-old lady from Hong Kong in November 2013. We have shown that while the HA, NA, and MP gene of A/Hong Kong/470129/2013 cluster with other human A(H7N9) isolates, the PB2, PB1, and NS genes are closely related to the A/Guangdong/1/2013 isolated in August 2013 but distinct from other human and avian A(H7N9) viruses detected during the spring outbreak in China. The PA gene of A/Hong Kong/470129/2013 does not cluster with any human or avian A(H7N9) strains but clusters with avian A(H9N2), A(H6N2) and A(H7N7) viruses. Taken together, the phylogenetic analysis indicates that the A/Hong Kong/470129/2013 is a novel reassortant presumably originated from reassortment event involving A/Guangdong/1/2013 (H7N9) and other avian influenza A viruses in the field.",

In fact, L336M substitution is conserved among the 2009 pandemic A(H1N1)pdm09 virus isolates but rarely found in other human or avian influenza viruses.19 PA L336M substitution has been shown to increase the polymerase activity. Mice challenged with recombinant A(H1N1) virus containing PA L336M substitution had more body weight loss and higher lung viral titres than those infected with the wild type virus, suggesting that PA L336M substitution is associated with higher pathogenicity in mammals.19 This may have important clinical significance because our patient had no risk factors for severe influenza but she developed very severe pneumonia with rapid progression to acute respiratory distress syndrome which finally required respiratory support by extracorporeal membrane oxygen. Moreover she also had multi-organ dysfunction as evident by impaired liver function and coagulation profile, cytopenia and rhadomyolysis. Another substitution, PB2 V139I, was identified only in the A/Hong Kong/470129/2013 and A/Guangdong/1/2013 strains, but not in other human or avian A(H7N9) strains.

(E) PB1. (F) NP. (G) NS. (H) MP. The phylogenetic trees were constructed using neighbour-joining method with Tamura-Nei model of nucleotide substitution using MEGA software package, version 5.05. The bootstrap values from 1000 replicates were performed to evaluate the reliability of the phylogenetic trees. The A/Hong Kong/470129/2013 was highlighted in bold font in red, while other human A(H7N9) strains were highlighted in blue. Sequences not determined in this study were obtained from NCBI Influenza Virus Resource database, except A/Anhui/1/2013 and A/Shanghai/1/2013 which were obtained from Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) EpiFlu\u2122 Database (Supplementary Table).",
