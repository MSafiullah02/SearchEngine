However, it is important to note that our study was not powered to detect important clinical steroid-related adverse events.

A substantial reduction in circulating lymphocytes can be demonstrated almost immediately upon injection of hydrocortisone in animal studies, with no further effect of increased dose or duration.22 Lymphopenia is reversible but lasts throughout the period of exposure. Steroids also inhibit T-cell activation, lymphocyte proliferation, and T helper 1/T helper 2 regulation.21 Given the known effects of steroids on the immune system, the lack of significant differences in lymphocyte numbers and subsets in our steroid-treated subjects is puzzling. However, very few data are available on the immune affects of steroids in acutely ill patients, particularly those with viral infections. Lymphopenia is associated with a number of acute viral infections, such as influenza and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus.23, 24 It is noteworthy that many of the patients in this study were lymphopenic at the time of presentation, and thus it is possible that RSV infection induces significant immunologic perturbations that may complicate interpretation of a steroid effect.",

Although differences were only statistically significant in serum-neutralizing titers against group A virus and nasal antibody to the F protein, it is likely that a larger sample size would have yielded significant differences in other parameters as well. High levels of serum and nasal RSV antibody have been shown to be protective from infection and severe disease in adults, although a specific protective antibody titer is not known.19, 25 Therefore, lower postinfection titers may leave steroid-treated patients more susceptible to future RSV exposures. However, the absolute differences in postinfection antibody titers we observed were relatively small, making the clinical implications of these findings uncertain. The diminished antibody response in the steroid group was not explained by a significant reduction in the number of B lymphocytes, ASCs, or CD4+ T-cell lymphocytes. However, it is possible that function or activation was impaired despite no discernible difference in cell numbers or subsets. In addition, we did not measure RSV-specific T-cell responses or ASC, which may have been preferentially affected by steroid administration.",

Although it is reasonable to presume steroid effects would be similar for other respiratory viruses, RSV has unique immunomodulatory effects, and, therefore, our findings may not be broadly applicable.26, 27, 28\n",

Since specific respiratory viral infections, with the exception of influenza, are rarely diagnosed in adults, and steroids are commonly prescribed for acute exacerbations of COPD, these data are reassuring. A modestly diminished humoral response may predispose patients to future RSV infections, but this risk must be balanced with the immediate antiinflammatory effects and potential clinical benefits.",
