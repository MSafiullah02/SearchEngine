In particular, as SARS-CoV-2 resides within the airway, surgery for pituitary and skull base lesions when access is via the nasal cavity, paranasal sinuses, or mastoid air cells has been flagged as high risk and caution recommended during the COVID-19 pandemic [5]. However, no data exist yet apart from a case report from Wuhan, China, of a patient who within the first week after endoscopic endonasal pituitary surgery developed COVID-19 [7]. No healthcare workers (HCWs) inside the operating room (OR) were subsequently diagnosed with COVID-19, although HCWs managing the patients without personal protective equipment (PPE) outside the OR did contract the virus. This case report was widely circulated on social media where it was initially reported that HCWs inside the OR were infected. Along with general concerns of ENT surgeons being particularly high risk for contracting COVID-19, a near complete arrest of pituitary and skull base procedures in many countries, including the UK, occurred [1]. This was supported by cautious guidance from various national bodies and societies [3, 4]. However, patients have continued to present with large tumors causing brainstem and optic apparatus compression, at risk of permanent neurological injury without expedited surgery [2].",

During that period, there was sustained transmission in the community, and the hospital had stopped all elective operations across all surgical subspecialties in order to accommodate COVID-19 patients. The characteristics of the patients are detailed in Table 2. The mean length of post-operative stay was 2.9 days (median 3 days). The mean follow-up period since these procedures is 17 days (median 13 days). No patients have had a COVID-19 diagnosis, based on the absence of clinical symptoms or signs (8/9 patients). One patient with post-operative fever had a negative COVID swab. In total, 36 operating room staff, 11 surgeons, and 10 anesthesiologists were involved in these 9 operations. No staff sickness related to a COVID-19 diagnosis was observed in any of these 57 HCWs during the follow-up period.",

Given that transsphenoidal surgery has been the standard of care for a long time, advocating that all pituitary surgery should be done transcranially during the pandemic seems unnecessary. Moreover, there is no evidence that this is safer for patients or HCWs. A cautious strategy, which incorporates clinical screening and pre-operative testing as described in this report, appears to be adequate. At the same time, we recognize the risks of operating during the pandemic\u2014to the patients and HCWs\u2014and for this reason, we are not currently performing surgery when the sole indication would be to control endocrine hyperfunction and where other medical management options exist. In the rare scenario of rapid visual decline in a patient with a pituitary tumor, when there is not enough time to wait for the results of a COVID swab, we would favor a transcranial approach or, if necessary, endonasal surgery with powered air-purifying respirators (PAPRs) for all OR staff.",

Auditing of outcomes of operations during the pandemic is needed, and efforts to do this nationally and internationally are beginning to take shape. It is also important to examine the outcomes of patients whose treatment has been delayed [6]. Additional research that would be useful relates to measuring the actual generation of aerosols during skull base approaches and methods to mitigate this. Moreover, point-of-care testing will hopefully allow testing of all patients close to the time of surgery in the near future; this will be helpful but it will be important to validate such testing especially prior to widespread use in high-risk settings.",
