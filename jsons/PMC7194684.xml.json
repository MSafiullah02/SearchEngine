Glycosylation of therapeutic antibodies influences their stability and solubility, bioactivity and immunogenicity. Protein glycosylation also affects pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics properties of therapeutic glycoproteins (Ghaderi et al., 2012). For example, partially glycosylated proteins, which usually contain terminal galactose, have much shorter circulatory lifetimes compared to fully glycosylated proteins with terminal sialic acid. Protein glycosylation also depends on the type of host cells and culturing conditions (media, pH, temperature, agitation) (Hossler et al., 2009).",

Humans and great apes have two IgA subclasses: IgA1 and IgA2, which differ in their glycosylation. IgA1 comprises approximately 85 % of total IgA concentration in serum. IgA1 contains heavily O-glycosylated 23 amino acids long hinge region, whereas IgA2 subclass contains only N-linked oligosaccharides because its shorter hinge region is devoid of O-linked glycosylation. IgA\u2019s N-glycosylation of CH2 at position 263 is as in all Ig isotypes predominantly of biantennary complex-type with \u03b12\u20136-linked sialic acids. Both IgAs contains also unique C-terminal tail interacting with the J-chain and secretory component to mediate dimerization and that contains N-linked glycans at position 459 of the triantennary type, with \u03b12\u20136 and \u03b12\u20133 linked sialic acids Thanks to sialic acid presented in the complex N-linked glycans at position 459 of IgA\u2019s C-terminal tail, over 90 % of the N-linked glycans in IgA1 are sialylated while only about 10 % of the N-linked glycans in IgG1 contain sialic acid (Mattu et al., 1998; Royle et al., 2003; Correa et al., 2013; Wuhrer et al., 2007; Maurer et al., 2018). Since sialic acid competes with viral receptor, IgAs antibodies neutralize virus much more potently than IgG1 (Maurer et al., 2018). Moreover, dimeric IgA containing J-chain was more effective in inhibition of ligand binding and receptor downmodulation that monomeric form (Lohse et al., 2011).",

            "text": "Many studies underscore the importance of the choice of expression system for production of glycoproteins (Goh et Kong, 2018). For example, glycoproteins produced by mammalian cell systems usually contain macro- and micro-heterogeneity in terms of glycosylation patterns (Sol\u00e1 et Griebenow, 2010). They may also contain minor non-human glycans such as N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc) and terminal a1\u22123-Galactose (a-Gal) modification (Zhang et al., 2016a). CHO cell lines usually have some limitations for culture longevity and the quality of the protein of interest: low specific growth rate and cell concentration (Gupta et al., 2017). Also high consumption of glucose and glutamine results in such undesirable main metabolites as lactate and ammonium. These limits cause low productivity of the production process (Altamirano et al., 2013). Galactose metabolism is slower than that for glucose, allowing a reduction in lactate generation and an increase in cell viability (Altamirano et al., 2000). Reduction of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle flux without the impairment of glycolytic activity would be another possibility to increase mitochondrial NAD+. Glutamine is directly fed into the TCA cycle and significantly contributes to cell metabolism. Reduction of its specific uptake rate could induce lactate consumption. Therefore, glutamine depletion has been shown to have the potential to induce the lactate metabolic shift (Zagari et al., 2013). Moreover, the effect of the different nucleotide sugar precursors (mannose, galactose, fucose, glucosamine) have been reported to have an effect on the glycosylation patterns of glycoproteins (Blondeel et al., 2015; Lin et al., 2015; Slade et al., 2016; Wong et al., 2010).",

            "text": "In the first part of this work, the impact of succinic acid or asparagine supplementation on productivity and lactate level of IgA1/2G9 stable cell line was studied. Lactate production is crucial for metabolism of cultured mammalian cells. Lactate is strongly produced during the exponential growth phase. IgA1 producing stable cell line was grown in batch and fed-batch cultures consisting of different media supplements and feedings. The cell culture typically demonstrates low productivity on the log phase (up to 6\u20138 days) when the cells proliferate exponentially and consume the nutrients in the growth medium. Therefore, we started to measure IgA1 concentration and LDH activity from Day 10. Results shown on Fig. 1\ndemonstrate influence of supplementation with succinic acid or asparagine in IMDM on cell concentration and productivity. IMDM supplemented with 8 mM l-glutamine was used as control. l-glutamin is a crucial component of culture media. It supports the growth of cells and is therefore used in wide range of serum-free and classical media as source for rapid cells dividing. The concentration of cells grown on basal medium supplemented with 8 mM succinic acid was higher compared to both control and 8 mM asparagine on Days 10 and 14 (Fig. 1A). As shown on Fig. 1B, comparison of productivity for cell line grown on IMDM supplemented with different additives demonstrated that on Day 14 the productivity of the culture supplemented with succinic acid was higher compared to the both control and asparagine. Interestingly, data of productivity for both succinic acid and asparagine was equal on Day 10. In the case of lactate concentration (Fig. 1C), use of succinic acid supplementation led to slightly lower lactate level on Day 10 compared to glutamine and asparagine. On Day 14, lactate level was 1.5 and 2.0 times lower for asparagine and succinic acid supplements, respectively, than for glutamine.",

Supplements of d-(+)-glucose (usual feeding component for fed-batch cultures), d-(+)-mannose and d-(+)- galactose were added to each flask in 10 mM final concentration on Days 5 and 7. A control cell culture was grown on basal medium without any feeding. Fig. 2\nA shows that cell culture samples fed with glucose, mannose or galactose reached their maximum of cell density between 3,0\u20133,2 \u00d7 106 cell/mL, what is around 1.5 times higher than control on Day 7. However, the sample fed with glucose demonstrated a slightly higher cell density compared to control on Days 10. In contrast, the samples fed with galactose and mannose showed the cell concentration 1.4 and 1.6 times higher, respectively, compared to control on Day 10. On Day 14, the cell concentration was the highest for feeding with mannose and the lowest again for control. Fig. 2B shows that the level of dimeric IgA1 production on Day 14 was the highest for the cell culture fed with mannose, lower for cell cultures grown with glucose and galactose and the lowest for control. The productivity and cell concentration data correlate with lactate level production. Cell cultures fed with glucose and galactose had a higher lactate level than samples fed with mannose. The lactate level production on Day 14 was similar in cultures with glucose and galactose ranging between 5.3\u20135.8 milliunits/mL. Results presented in Fig. 2C demonstrate that the use of mannose instead of glucose during the fed stage caused the decrease in lactate level twice on Day 14. The fed-batch cell culture grown on the basal medium with glucose or galactose feeding exhibited a typical lactate production way, whereas feeding of cell culture with mannose probably changed the metabolic way reducing lactate level in culture. Culture fed with mannose exhibited a lactate shift from lactate production to lactate consumption. Using of asparagine or succinic acid as basal media supplements also changed metabolism of cells. Such shifting of metabolic pathway could influence the structure of IgA1 glycans.",

The supplementation with glutamine without feeding sugars (Sample 1) led to the decrease in sialylation profile (based on signal intensities for interaction with lectin SNA) and increase of accessible GlcNac (WGA). The metabolic shift from glutamine to asparagine could change forms of glycans to hybrid and high mannose type as we observed in Sample 2. The same change in glycan forms, increased high-mannosylation, was observed for the sample supplemented with glutamine and fed with glucose (Sample 4). Increased high-mannose in Samples 2 and 4 was confirmed by both techniques, lectin-based microarray and MALDI-MS as mentioned above. It was suggested that increased high mannose IgG glycosylation produced in CHO was possibly related to osmolality and Golgi/ER pH and increasing productivity (Pacis et al., 2011). Reported was also assumption that high mannose glycosylation during antibody production have multiple mechanisms but the question of why certain clones produce IgG with higher mannose than other clones even with identical culture conditions remains unclear (Slade et al., 2016). It was demonstrated that mannose is a good carbon source for CHO cell growth and immunoglobulin production, readily entering both glycolysis and the TCA Cycle. Usually, proteins produced in CHO cells grown with mannose demonstrate a high increase in total high mannose glycosylation in recombinant IgG, with no effect on cell growth, viability, or titer (Zhang et al., 2019). In contrast, in our study we found an increase in cell viability, productivity and absent of high mannose glycans for cell line produced dimeric form of recombinant IgA1 grown with mannose. Such difference is probably associated with specificity of mannose metabolism for dimeric IgA.",

            "text": "Therapeutic proteins, dimeric IgA1, were produced by stable cell line IgA1/2G9 on the basal medium at different conditions (different supplementation and feeding). Evaluation of the effect of different conditions on lactate production correlating with IgA productivity reveals lactate metabolism shift in the absence of such main carbon source as glutamine and in the presence of succinic acid or asparagine. A correlation between low lactate level and mannose feeding was found as well. The main aim of this work was to employ high-throughput lectin-based microarray assay for determination of changes in glycan composition of therapeutic proteins and correlation with N-glycan analysis by MALDI-MS. We observed that metabolic shift from glutamine to asparagine changed increase of hybrid and high mannose glycan forms. Supplement of succinic acid led to reduced galactosylation and supplement of glutamine and feeding with mannose led to increase of both sialylation and galactosylation. The explanation of determined changes needs further investigation. Glycan analysis was based mostly on lectin-based microarray assay since MALDI-MS doesn\u2019t allow reliable quantification, however, MALDI-MS confirmed presence of N-glycan structures in accordance with results of lectin-based microarray analysis in the case of all samples. The developed lectin-based microarray platform represents effective tool for the screening and evaluation of glycosylation pattern of IgAs and other therapeutic proteins as well and for the determination of changes in their glycan profile. Moreover, this topic is currently important because of COVID-19 pandemic. Therapeutic IgAs are effective in defense against viruses that use sialic acid as a receptor. Although the binding of SARS-CoV to sialic acids has not been reported so far, if SARS-CoV-2 like other coronaviruses targets sialic acids (Tortorici et al., 2019; Devaux et al., 2020), this interaction could be used as therapeutic target, and it is glycan composition of IgA that has a major impact on antiviral activity of this class of therapeutic antibodies.",
