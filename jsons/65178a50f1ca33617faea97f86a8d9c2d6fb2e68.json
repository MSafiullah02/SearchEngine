The mismatch between the true body shape and the one used for reconstruction is known to introduce errors, which to date have not been properly characterized. In the present study we, therefore, seek to 1) characterize and quantify the errors resulting from a reconstruction shape mismatch for a number of popular EIT reconstruction algorithms and 2) develop recommendations on the tolerated amount of mismatch for each algorithm. Using real and simulated data, we analyze the performance of four EIT reconstruction algorithms under different degrees of shape mismatch. Results suggest that while slight shape mismatch is well tolerated by all algorithms, using a circular shape severely degrades their performance.",

In thoracic EIT, imperceptible current injection and voltage measurement through surface electrodes around the thorax are used to reconstruct a conductivity map across a transverse slice of the body. EIT is low-cost, noninvasive, radiation free, and available at the bedside. One of the most promising applications of EIT is for monitoring and/or guiding mechanical ventilation therapy. The ability of EIT to measure regional distribution of ventilation has been validated against single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) [1] , X-ray computed tomography (CT) [2] , [3] , and positron emission tomography (PET) [4] . No other currently available technology can provide real-time long term monitoring of the regional functional state of the lungs.

This lack of correspondence to the anatomy imposes several limitations on the analysis of EIT images.

However, for practical reasons, EIT reconstruction cannot depend on the availability of a CT scan of each individual subject. Patient shape could instead be obtained by means of, for example, wearable sensors or through optical 3-D surface reconstruction (from images obtained with a multi-camera system). However, we believe that developing a set of predefined shapes to choose from for each patient based on easy to measure parameters (weight, height, etc.) is the most practical and least expensive approach. In order to develop such a set, a deeper understanding of the errors and tolerances of different EIT algorithms with respect to shape mismatch is required.",

An FEM with a lung contrast conforming to the CT slice is created and used to simulate a number of targets covering the whole body.

First, the true shape was obtained from a single CT image of the thorax at the electrode plane by manual delineation with a number of points (37 for the human shape and 41 for the swine). The original pixel coordinates of the resulting points were rigidly transformed such that the entire shape fitted in a square with side 2 centered at the origin. All subsequents unit-less quantities are reported in this coordinate system. Second, the points were interpreted in the complex plane (with origin coinciding with the Cartesian coordinates just defined) and a parametric description of the shape was obtained by taking the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) of the resulting complex vector. Third, progressively smoother shapes were obtained by truncating the Fourier series, two components at a time, down to a length of five terms (at 3 the resulting shape was an almost perfect circle but off-center with respect to the other shapes). At each series length a new shape of 41-45 equidistant points, the exact number adjusted to allow the creation of a finite element model with Netgen [12] as described below, was obtained by padding the truncated Fourier series with zeros and taking the inverse DFT. All shapes were scaled to have the same area as the original . The last shape was a circle with radius 1. Representative shapes for both animal and human geometries are presented in Fig. 2 .",

The results suggest that conductivity changes in less conductive tissues (e.g., inflated lung) are overestimated. This effect has potentially far reaching consequences for ventilation monitoring in patients with atelectasis (lung collapse), where EIT could underestimate ventilation in the more conductive collapsed regions of the lung. We also observed that AR is not uniform close to the boundary-it is high in the vicinity of the electrodes and low between them. This could distort the lung shape in some cases and be one of the sources of boundary artifacts in EIT images. In terms of position error, the GREIT algorithm seems to have the lowest ranking performance. Although in the center of the image its performance is on a par or exceeds those of the other algorithms, objects that are close to the boundary but between electrodes are reconstructed deeper in the body than they ought to be.

If no prior imaging is available, the physician could choose the appropriate shape of the thorax from a set of predefined shapes based on measurements of a patient's height, weight, BMI, chest circumference or other easy to measure variables. Measurements like chest circumference, as well as 2-D measurements of the anterior-posterior and lateral dimension can be easily obtained at the bedside and can be helpful in determining the approximate shape.

Second, for safety and practical reasons clinical use of EIT cannot depend on a prior examination with an anatomical modality used to build patient-specific models. Instead, efforts should be directed at developing other methods of measuring the patients' shape or identifying easy to measure physiological parameters that could be used to build an approximate FEM model or choose one from a library of ready-made models, and developing the required tools. The practicality of the latter approach, which we plan to explore in the near future, will depend largely on the required size of such a model library.

This allowed us to easily control and quantify the amount of shape mismatch and offered insights into the performance loss caused by using the circular shape in studies on humans and swine. However, we can draw no conclusions about which particular features of a subject's shape are the most important to preserve. Thus, a shape mismatch below the 4% threshold found in our study should not be interpreted as a sufficient or necessary condition for obtaining quality reconstructions in EIT.",

Because these algorithms only reconstruct relative changes in conductivity rather than its absolute value, they are less sensitive to uncertainties in initial conditions such as shape, electrode positions, their size and conductivity. Since changes in conductivity are of primary interest in ventilation monitoring, and due to the mentioned advantages, difference imaging is the most widespread approach to thoracic EIT.",

We demonstrated that using a circular model, as is frequently done, has a strong detrimental effect on a number of desired characteristics of difference EIT reconstruction algorithms, impeding analysis of the resultant images and possibly skewing conclusions. However, we found that small shape mismatch is well tolerated by all tested algorithms, allowing the use of approximate rather than exact model shapes. Future research and development effort should concentrate on developing the requisite knowledge and methods to allow easy choice of an appropriate model shape for individual patients at the bedside.",
