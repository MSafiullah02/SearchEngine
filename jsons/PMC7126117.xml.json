            "text": "The basic reproductive ratio, R0, is a fundamental concept in both within-host and epidemiological models of pathogen dynamics. Defined as the number of secondary infections caused by a single infectious individual in a susceptible population, R0 is used to gauge the magnitude of the risk associated with a novel pathogen, and to estimate the degree of control that will be necessary to contain an outbreak. For example, in the last several years R0 has been a key factor in our understanding of emerging diseases such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) (Choi and Pak, 2003, Lipsitch et al., 2003, Lloyd-Smith et al., 2003, Riley et al., 2003) and avian influenza (Stegeman et al., 2004, Ferguson et al., 2005, Longini et al., 2005), livestock diseases such as Bovine Spongiform Encephalitus (Woolhouse and Anderson, 1997, Ferguson et al., 1999, de Koeijer et al., 2004) and Foot and Mouth Disease (Ferguson et al., 2001, Matthews et al., 2003), as well as vector-borne disease such as Dengue (Luz et al., 2003), Malaria (Hagmann et al., 2003, Smith and Ellis McKenzie, 2004) and West Nile Virus (Wonham et al., 2004, Cruz-Pacheco et al., 2005). Recent analyses of HIV therapy (Smith, 2006), river blindness (Filipe et al., 2005) and Escherichia\ncoli in cattle (Matthews et al., 2006) also rely on this important concept (see Heffernan et al., 2005 for review).",

In an ODE formulation, this is a direct result of the Markov property that each state is memoryless, that is, the probability of making a transition to a new state does not depend on the length of time an individual has spent in the current state. For example, in all ODE models the probability of death is independent of the age of the individual or the time since infection; likewise the probability of recovery is independent of the time since infection. (For simplicity we use the word lifetime to mean the time spent in a single state or class such as \u201cinfected\u201d; we do not restrict this word to mean the entire lifetime of the individual.)",

Non-exponential distributions have also been used to describe the mean incubation period (Anderson, 1988, Lui et al., 1988) and infectious period (Blythe and Anderson, 1988, Castillo-Chavez et al., 1989, Mittler et al., 1998, Nelson et al., 2004) of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV).

Likewise, for the SARS example, changes in the death time distribution affected R0. However, the shape of the death time distribution for infected cells had no effect on R0 for in-host HIV infection. This can be explained using the concept of competing processes. For SARS, individuals leave the infected state either through recovery or death; recovery and death are competing, in this sense, to end the infectious period. In the epidemiological model of HIV, the infectious period ends if individuals progress to AIDS, or if they cease to be sexually active. In the in-host HIV model, however, the death of an infected cell is not in competition with another process.",

For example, in Section 2 we found that lifetime distribution for the infected cells did not affect R0. This is because the death of infected cells is not in competition with any other process. Nonetheless, solving system (1) for the infected equilibrium we find(16)x\u00af=x0R0,y\u00af=\u03bb(R0-1)aR0,v\u00af=d(R0-1)\u03b2,R0=kQ\u03b2x0au,where x0 is the initial number of uninfected T-cells (Nowak and May, 2000, Lloyd, 2001a). If, instead, we assume that the death time distributions for the uninfected and infected cells are distributed as arbitrary distributions d^(t) and a^(t) with means 1/d and 1/a, respectively, the infected equilibrium is given by(17)x\u00af=x0R0,y\u00af=\u03b2x0v\u00afaR0,R0=kQ\u03b2x0auand(18)\u03bb\u222b0\u221ee-\u222b0sd^(\u03c4)d\u03c4-\u03b2v\u00afsds=x0R0.Thus, we find that the infected equilibrium will change even though R0 is not affected when the death of infected cells is non-exponentially distributed. We also find that if x\u00af and x0 are known, R0 can be directly calculated from disease data irrespective of this distribution. If the distributions of competing processes are non-exponential, however, the relationship between R0 and the infected equilibrium will change.",

Fig. 6\nplots the time distribution of infectious virions budded from a single infected cell (b(t)f(t) from Eq. (22)) when the distribution of cell lifetimes is exponential (dashed line) or approximately Gaussian (solid line). In both cases the area under the curve is the same, and thus R0 does not change. When lifetimes are Gaussian-distributed, however, the infected cells bud the same number of virions in a shorter period of time, thus increasing the initial growth rate (Fig. 2(b)). In this case, the conventional set of differential equations (1) allows us to obtain the correct value for the basic reproductive ratio, but does not model the initial growth rate or subsequent dynamics accurately.",
