In 1992, the omb gene in Drosophila melanogaster was found to share homology with Brachyury in the DNA binding domain [6]. Since the discovery of mouse T gene and its orthologs, more than 20 TBX genes have been identified in species ranging from invertebrates such as Drosophila and C. elegans to vertebrates including Zebrafish, Xenopus, mouse, chicken and human.

Several studies have focused on the spatial and temporal expression patterns of TBX2/TBX3 during development, and their functions ranging from the specification of early embryonic germ layers to the determination of cell fate during organogenesis [9]. Indeed, the critical role of T-box genes in development is underscored by the fact that mutations in several T-box genes are associated with a number of developmental defects. In human, mutations in TBX3 and TBX5 would lead to autosomal dominant or semi-dominant genetic syndromes. Mutations in TBX3 cause an autosomal dominant disorder, the ulnar-mammary syndrome (UMS) [10], and mutations in TBX5 lead to Holt-Oram's syndrome, with characteristic defects in the heart and limb [11], [12].",

The T-box is located anywhere within the protein and has no apparent sequence similarity to any known DNA-binding motif of other transcription factors [15]. The first member of the T-box family, Brachyury (T), has been the most extensively studied by far and utilized as a model for elucidating the structure and function of other T-box genes. For Brachyury, sequence analysis revealed a palindromic sequence [TTT(G/C)ACACCTAGGTGTGAAA] to which Brachyury could bind as a monomer or a dimer [16]. All members identified to date have been shown to bind to the core sequence GGTGTGA, referred to as the T-element, as a monomer [15]. However, some members have been shown to recognize other non-canonical sequences. In Holt-Oram's syndrome TBX5 was found to bind to an 8-bp core sequence that was part of the Brachyury consensus-binding sites [17]. In addition, TBX2 was reported to bind to the TRP-1 MSEu and MSEi motif as a repressor of TRP-1 expression [3]. Another study identified a variant T-site, matching 13 of 20 nucleotides of a consensus T-domain, as the essential TBX2/3-binding site in the human p14 promoter [18]. Although all T-box genes recognize similar DNA sequences, increasing evidence suggests that they regulate different target genes which may be dependent on the promoter context and co-factors, such as different quaternary structures of T-box genes, which suggest different DNA binding modes and interactions with different target genes [19], [20], [21]. It is believed that the functions of T-box proteins are regulated by protein-protein interactions with other transcription factors, including TAZ, YAP, SMADs, EGR1 and Pitx homeoproteins, and many studies have indeed proven this to be the case [22], [23], [24], [25], [26], [27], [28].",

            "text": "Unlike most members of the T-box family that function as transcription activators, TBX2 and TBX3 are the only mammalian T-box factors that function as transcriptional repressors [2], [3]. The study of He et al. showed that the Xenopus TBX3 ortholog, ET, had a strong RD from residues 558 to 647 in the C-terminal, and the repression activity of this domain was quite similar to that of the full-length ET in both basal and activated transcription in human cell lines and Xenopus embryos. They also found that this RD was a portable repressor domain and highly conserved in human TBX3 and TBX2 [2]. A few years later, the study of Carlson et al. confirmed and extended these results. Their study revealed a key RD between amino acids 567 and 612 in human TBX3. Additionally, they showed that most UMS-associated C-terminal mutants lacked this RD and exhibited decreased or loss of transcriptional repression activity [29]. Moreover, more recent evidence has shown that the unique RD, composed of about 90\u2013110 residues among different species, is found only in TBX2 and TBX3 and does not share any conserved sequence or motif with other known RDs (Dong et al., unpublished). Following a multiple alignment of TBX2 and TBX3 sequences among different species (i.e. ranged from zebrafish to human), they find that only 56 residues (between amino acids 558\u2013623) are highly conserved (Fig. 1\n). The study of Yarosh et al. have shown that TBX3 interacts with HDAC1, 2, and 3 via two distinct binding sites, and deletion of the RD (amino acids 566\u2013624) of TBX3 completely abolishes its interaction with HDAC5 [30]. This study suggests that TBX3 may function by recruiting HDACs to the RD in the promoter region. Therefore, detailed analysis on RD would help to further understand the molecular mechanisms of transcriptional repression mediated by TBX2 and TBX3.",

In Fig. 2\n, we summarized the current findings of TBX2 and TBX3 and their associated signaling pathways involved in cancer development. The abnormal expression of TBX2 and TBX3 has been reported in various cancers (Table 1\n), including melanoma, breast, pancreatic, liver, lung, ovarian, bladder and cervical cancers [28], [30], [31], [32], [33], [34], [35], [36], [37], [38], [39], [40], [41], [42], [43], [44], [45], [46], [47]. TBX2 is shown to be amplified and upregulated in a subset of breast cancer cell lines, and BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutant breast tumors [28], [30], [31], [32], [33]. Similarly, TBX3 is shown to be overexpressed in a subset of breast cancer cell lines [34] and to be upregulated in plasma from breast and ovarian cancer patients [35]. Both TBX2 and TBX3 are also closely associated with pancreatic cancer. While TBX2 is found to be upregulated in 50% of 31 pancreatic cancer cell lines tested [36], [37], TBX3 is found to be overexpressed in metastatic pancreatic endocrine neoplasms [38]. Notably, TBX2 is located in chromosome 17q23 [39], a region frequently amplified in breast and pancreatic cancer cells [30], [36], [40], [41]. Furthermore, both TBX2 and TBX3 are expressed in normal melanocytes and have been shown to be strongly overexpressed in a panel of melanoma cell lines [3,42,43]. Deregulated expression of TBX2 and TBX3 has also been reported in other cancers. TBX3 overexpression is closely associated with the mutational status of beta-catenin in murine liver tumors induced by Myc as well as in human hepatocellular carcinomas and hepatoblastomas [44]. Moreover, the upregulation of TBX3 is strongly associated with metastatic phenotypes of uterine cervical cancer [45]. TBX2, which is expressed in normal human fibroblasts, is recently shown to be reduced in several transformed fibroblast cell lines [46], while TBX3 is found to be upregulated in transformed lung fibroblast cells [47]. In addition, ectopic expression of TBX2 could result in polyploidy and cisplatin resistance in several human transformed lung fibroblast cell lines [48]. Although the above results suggest a strong association of both TBX2 and TBX3 with cancer, they do not provide the exact mechanism(s) for how these T-box genes contribute to tumorigenesis.",

Cellular senescence is a protective mechanism against cancer, and is broadly defined as a physiological program of irreversible growth arrest, which could be triggered by telomeres shortening (replicative senescence) or other stress signals (accelerated senescence) [49]. This \u201caccelerated senescence,\u201d which does not involve telomere shortening, is also triggered in normal cells by the oncogenic mutations of Ras or Raf and by some other forms of supraphysiological mitogenic signal [50], [51], [52]. One of the best characterized mechanisms for cellular senescence is the ARF/MDM2/ p53/p21CIP1 pathway [53]. Expression of ARF can be induced by overexpression of a variety of oncogenes or mitogenic signals resulting in binding of MDM2, stabilization of p53, and a program of gene expression that leads to either cell cycle arrest or apoptosis. Growth arrest of senescent cells is initiated with the activation of p53. The activated p53 has multiple effects on gene expression, the most relevant of which in regard to senescence is transcriptional activation of the CDK inhibitor p21CIP1, which is necessary for p53-mediated growth arrest [54], [55]. In primary cells, this pathway can act as a monitor of oncogenic transformation and can induce p53-dependent or -independent cell cycle arrest, senescence and apoptosis. However, downregulation or inhibition of ARF can result in bypass of senescence, failure of apoptosis, promotion of cell proliferation and immortalization.",

[33] has shown that TBX2 is able to promote bypass of senescence by downregulating the expression of p19ARF in senescence-predisposed BMI\u2212/\u2212 mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). Moreover, forced expression of p19ARF in TBX2 expressing MEFs recapitulates the senescence process, indicating that TBX2 could promote bypass of senescence by inhibiting p19ARF levels. In addition to TBX2, TBX3 is also involved in regulation of cell senescence [30], [56]. This is confirmed when ectopic expression of TBX3 results in immortalization of MEFs through suppressing the expression of p19ARF, suggesting that the immortalization effect is partly due to repression of the ARF/MDM2/p53 pathway. Consistent with this hypothesis, point mutations in the T-box domain of TBX3 which are believed to result in loss of binding to DNA, impair the ability of TBX3 to inhibit senescence or suppress p14ARF expression. Furthermore, the overexpression of TBX3 is also shown to regulate the p53 pathway to both suppress apoptosis and facilitate transformation [57]. These effects of TBX3 are probably due to the suppression of p14ARF, which leads to MDM2-dependent sequestration, degradation and inactivation of p53.",

Because p21CIP1 is implicated in the regulation of cellular senescence, the ability of TBX2/TBX3 to suppress the expression of both p14ARF and p21CIP1 may provide an explanation for a powerful and cooperative antisenescence signal. The possibility that TBX2/TBX3 contributes to tumorigenesis by inhibiting senescence is supported by a study, which showed that expression of an inducible dominant-negative TBX2 could result in displacement of histone deacetylase 1, up-regulation of p21CIP1 expression, and the induction of replicative senescence in CDKN2A-null B16 melanoma cells [42].",

Rb and its close homologs p107 and p130 physically interact with many proteins, but their binding to members of the E2F family of transcription factors is central to their role in cell cycle regulation, especially during G1 phase [63]. Complexes between pRb family members and various E2Fs block the activation of E2F responsive genes by recruiting HDACs and other chromatin remodeling factors to E2F responsive promoters [64], [65], [66]. Notably, E2Fs regulate genes necessary for DNA replication, including those enzymes required for DNA metabolism and synthesis, as well as cyclins E and A. Therefore, the active hypophosphorylated forms of Rb family members block entry into S phase by inhibiting the E2F transcriptional program. In addition to its role in E2F regulation, pRb family members also interact with transcription factors that govern cell differentiation, such as C/EBP, NFIL-6 and c-jun [67], [68], [69].",

In the nucleus, beta-catenin can act as a main effector of the canonical Wnt pathway. However, at the plasma membrane, beta-catenin is a critical component of adherens junctions, acting in cell-cell adhesion by linking E-cadherin in conjunction with alpha-catenin to the actin cytoskeleton [75]. Loss of E-cadherin expression results in a reduced degradation and subsequent overexpression of free cytoplasmic beta-catenin, which will subsequently translocate the nucleus and activate the Wnt pathway. Rodriguez et al. has shown that TBX3 and TBX2 repress the expression of E-cadherin in melanoma cells, and depletion of TBX3 increases E-cadherin mRNA and protein levels and suppresses melanoma invasiveness in vitro\n[43]. These results suggest that TBX2 and TBX3 may play a dual role during the radial to vertical growth phase transition by both inhibiting senescence via repression of p21CIP1, and enhancing melanoma invasiveness by reducing E-cadherin levels.",

The theoretical rationale is based on the fact that TBX2/TBX3 is overexpressed and functions as a potential oncogene in various cancers. Such results offer the experimental bases for the use of TBX2/TBX3 as therapeutic targets. One strategy is to inhibit the function of TBX2/TBX3. HDAC inhibitors promote growth arrest, differentiation and apoptosis of cancer cells. The US FAD have approved vorinostate for the treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL). The other HDAC inhibitors, including FK228, PXD101, PCI-24781, ITF2357, MGCD0103, MS-275, valproic acid and LBH589, have also demonstrated therapeutic potential as monotherapy or combination with other anti-tumor drugs in CTCL and other malignancies [77]. Inhibition of the functions of TBX2/TBX3 would be one of anticancer mechanisms. Given that TBX2/TBX3 is overexpressed in cancer, inhibition of its expression would reduce or eliminate its oncogenic properties. RNA interference (RNAi) is a strategy to specifically knockdown a target protein. The major challenge is to develop an effective siRNA delivery vector with a long half-life in circulation, low toxicity and low immunogenicity. Another concern is the potential off-targets effects of RNAi as silence of other members of T-box gene family or unpredicted important genes may lead to severe side-effects in vivo.",

As no any other protein has this special RD and the expression of TBX2/TBX3 is at low level in somatic cells, it is possible to design a drug targeting RD with high specificity. Unlike the current anticancer drugs, this drug would be very precious for the treatment of various cancers because of the low toxicity and low side-effects. The studies of the RD structure, especially the crystal structure of the interaction of RD with its counterparts, would help us to design specific compounds to block the functions of TBX2 and TBX3 in cancer cells. Based on the small RD, an alternative is to design synthetic peptides to block TBX2/TBX3 without the crystal structure information of the RD. For example, without the known crystal structure of spike protein of SARS-coronavirus, effective peptides were identified to block the interaction of spike protein and its receptor by peptide scan assays [78]. Currently, there is great interest in employing peptides or proteins as therapeutic agents for cancer treatment. Several peptides derived from tumor suppressors or oncogenes have been developed as antitumorigenic drugs and proven to be effective in inhibition of tumor cell growth [79], [80], [81], [82]. We prospect that antagonist peptides targeting the RD of TBX2/3 would be effective agents for the treatment of a number of human cancers in the future. We also prospect that computer-based drug design will help us to develop RD specific inhibitors after the crystal structure of RD is figured out in the future. Some of the RD inhibitors may be good for anticancer treatment.",

Upregulation of TBX2 and TBX3 suppresses the expression of p14ARF and p21CIP1 and promotes bypass of senescence through inactivation of p53 pathway. TBX2 functionally interacts with pRb, and pRb modulates TBX2 functional specificity. In addition, TBX3 is shown to be a downstream target of the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway, and overexpression of TBX2 and TBX3 represses the expression of E-cadherin, which is demonstrated to be a prerequisite for epithelial tumor cell invasion and a negative regulator of the canonical Wnt pathway. Moreover, TBX2 is shown to interact with EGR1 and suppress multiple downstream tumor suppressors. Identification and characterization of target genes which are transcriptionally regulated by TBX2 and TBX3 are essential for an improved understanding of the roles of TBX2 and TBX3 in tumorigenesis. Drugs targeting the RD of TBX2/3 would be attractive for the treatment of a number of human cancers in the future.",
