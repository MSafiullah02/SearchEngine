            "text": "The COVID-19 outbreak in China was the third outbreak caused by a coronavirus since the 21st century, and the number of infected people has exceeded the previous SARS and MERS. 9e11 With the strengthening of diagnosis, treatment, prevention and control of disease, patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in Wuhan and surrounding areas in Hubei province have achieved good effects; however, how to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in other regions was another important issue. Although there have been a large number of researches on the epidemiology and clinical characteristics of the COVID-19, the researchers were mainly from Wuhan, 3e6 and the local epidemiology of the COVID-19 in imported cities was extremely scarce. The epidemiological and clinical characteristics of local cases and imported cases were still unclear, which hindered the assessment of the potential of the COVID-19 to spread outside Wuhan and made the epidemic prevention and control in imported cities more complicated. We conducted a statistical comparison of the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of imported cases and local cases in main district of Chongqing, hoping to provide guidance in preventing local epidemics, and to provide a reference for the development of prevention and control measures in other provinces and regions. This research provided epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 136 confirmed COVID-19 patients in main district of Chongqing. Among the 136 confirmed patients, the age was mainly concentrated in the age of 13e64. There was no difference in the incidence between male and female. The clinical characteristics were still mainly cough, fever, and fatigue. The above characteristics were not significantly different from those in Wuhan and Hubei province. 3, 4, 6 In 136 patients, 29 were imported cases (21.3%) and 107 were local cases (78.7%). We found that with the spread of COVID-19 in main district of Chongqing, the number of confirmed local cases has exceeded the number of imported cases. Compared with imported cases, local cases were characterized by older age, more females, cluster transmission, and family gathering cross-infection was more common. 12e14 The clinical symptoms of local cases are mainly cough rather than fever. The proportion of asymptomatic patients was higher. There are no differences in indicators such as incubation period, days from illness to admitted and bilateral lung injury. As per published article, the major symptoms of COVID-19 infection remain same and mainly cough, fever and dyspnea. In mild to severe stage, patients have mild fever, dyspnea and mild hypoxemia on day 10 of initial illness with bilateral infiltrating pneumonia in chest X-ray. This characteristic features coincided with the first confirmed COVID-19 case in the china and U.S. as well. 15 COVID-19 can spread from human to human, 13,16,17, but there were no comparison of characteristics in different generation. We divided 107 local patients into secondgeneration cases and third-generation cases according to the previous definition. We found that the third-generation cases had a lower rate of fever and a higher proportion of asymptomatic symptoms. We consider that it may be related to the more serial passage of COVID-19, the less pathogenic it became. 18, 19 Alternatively, some of the asymptomatic third-generation cases might be still in the pre-symptomatic stage because of their shorter follow-up time compared with the second-generation cases. Further clinical follow-up and laboratory studies would be required to provide more data for answering this important questions. Moreover, this phenomenon suggested that with the spread of COVID-19 in main district of Chongqing, the symptoms of patients before illness become more and more insidious, and clinical symptoms such as fever cannot be used as the exclusive early identification factor of the COVID-19. For suspected patients and their close contacts, surveillance is an important measure for local prevention. 20, 21 As a municipality directly under the central government, Chongqing was adjacent to the west of Hubei province and 940 km away from Wuhan. It has a population of about 31 million, of which the main district has a population of about 8.55 million. There were frequent personnel flow between Chongqing and Wuhan, and the situation of epidemic prevention and control was severe. By comparing imported cases with local cases, secondgeneration cases and third-generation cases, we can better detect the typical and evolutionary characteristics of the disease, and formulate effective and targeted measures. For example: take more comprehensive measures for screening patients, especially for elderly person, avoid family gatherings, and implement more closely surveillance of suspect patients and their close contacts. 12,22e24 Compared with the imported cases of the COVID-19 infection, the local cases were significantly older; the proportion of men is lower. There was higher proportion of cluster cases in local cases. Unlike imported cases, which fever was the dominant symptom, the local cases have more cough patients, with a significant higher proportion of asymptomatic patients. Compared with second-generation cases, the third-generation cases have a higher proportion of patients with cough rather than fever. The third-generation cases have a significant higher proportion of asymptomatic patients. It implied illness may not be accompanied by any of the acute signs but may appear insidiously in thirdgeneration. In summary, the characteristics of imported and local cases of COVID-19 in main district of Chongqing were different. Local cases were older and were mainly females. The family gathering cross-infection was more common in local cases. In addition, the cough was dominant symptoms than fever. With the increase generation in population spread and more concealed symptoms.AS COVID-19 spread from generation to generation, it implied illness may 4 P.

It was suggested to take more comprehensive measures for screening patients, especially for elderly person, avoid family gatherings, and implement more closely surveillance of suspect patients and their close contacts. It is hoped that characteristics of cases and prevention protocol in main district of Chongqing could provide a reference for other provinces and regions. This research represented the characteristics of early cases of COVID-19 in main district of Chongqing, which has certain limitations. Firstly, we only collected the data that were transferred to the designated hospitals in main district of Chongqing. In order to obtain more accurate results, it was better to extend the collection of more patient data. Secondly, the observation period of this research was only 26 days, which was relatively short.",
