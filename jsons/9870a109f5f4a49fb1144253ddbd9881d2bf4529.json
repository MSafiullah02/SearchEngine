The matrix had species as rows and line transects as columns. We calculated Morisita dissimilarity indices among species using the 'vegdist' function. Morisita is an index of patchiness, and it is used to calculate overlap among samples (Morisita, 1959) . The dissimilarity matrix obtained was clustered specifying the 'complete linkage' method in the 'hclust' function in the 'vegan' package. We applied the 'cascadeKM' function to the standardised square root indices and applied the Calinski-Harabasz criterion (Milligan & Cooper, 1985) to select the best partition inside the dendrogram obtained by the cluster, thereby dividing the whole species group into subgroups with a similar use of habitat types. In order to understand whether environmental characteristics influenced the abundance of individuals, we applied a generalised linear mixed effects model (GLMM) for count data (Atkins et al., 2012) for each of the previously selected groups. We ran zero-inflated GLMMs due to the huge amount of zeros in our data set. GLMMs were run by applying the AD Model Builder procedure using the 'glmmADMB' package in R (Skaug et al., 2013) , specifying the Poisson distribution inside the model (Bolker et al., 2012) . Before starting the analysis, we applied a conservative method to calculate significance for each factor included in the model based on the evaluation of the standard deviation calculated for each estimate multiplied by 2. Consequently, estimates were significant only if the interval enclosed by two times their standard deviations did not cross 0. According to Breslow (2004) , generalised linear mixed models may yield biased estimates of the variance component when the mean number of counts per treatment combination is less than five, so we removed from the analysis all the species whose number of counted individuals was below this value.

The weakness of this difference was clearly due to the large variance within groups, i.e., species with similar habitat requirements were not all equally specialised (Table 2, Fig. 2 ). In particular, within all groups but one (group 2), it seemed that one or two species were much more specialised than the others. In group 2, this subdivision was more difficult but the difference between the highest d i 0 (species 1 and 22) and the lowest d i 0 (species 6 and 9) was still large.

In particular, species grouping seemed to be based on a continuum index of lightness, ranging from group 1 generally being influenced by open areas to group 5 being strongly related to closed-canopy forests. If we look at the estimates associated with forest habitats and open habitats in our model ( Fig. 3) , we can see that they changed sign while proceeding from group 1 to group 5. In particular, forests are negatively related to the abundance of the sampled individuals in the first group, but they increase their positive influence while moving to group 5; the opposite occurs for the above-mentioned general open dry areas. Furthermore, all the species, regardless of the group identity, seemed to avoid natural dense deciduous forests and associated ecotones. These are closed and shaded habitats, and luminosity was shown to be very important for butterflies, determining minimum and maximum flight conditions (Douwes, 1976) as well as flight duration (Shreeve, 1984) . For example, in a restoration experiment of ponderosa pine forests in North America, butterfly species richness and abundance were up to three times greater in restoration treatment units where host plant and nectar plant species richness were similar to control units, but insolation (light intensity) was significantly greater (Waltz & Covington, 2004) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1080, "end": 1094, "text": "(Douwes, 1976)", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 1122, "end": 1137, "text": "(Shreeve, 1984)", "ref_id": "BIBREF55"}, {"start": 1469, "end": 1494, "text": "(Waltz & Covington, 2004)", "ref_id": "BIBREF63"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 460, "end": 467, "text": "Fig. 3)", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "This differential importance of habitat light intensity in structuring our studied butterfly assemblage is confirmed by a comparison of our results with previous information on the habitat characteristics for the studied species, which revealed a general congruence. All the three species of the first group are reported to inhabit bushy places, and dry and hot areas, and are usually associated with forest ecotones and clearing margins (Table S1 ). Species of the second group showed a negative relationship with the presence of forest areas, and a positive association with open natural heath areas. Furthermore, species of group 2 seemed to be more influenced by ecotones than species of group 1, with grassland representing the key habitat type. We also found a positive influence of riparian vegetation on individual abundance, probably because most of the individuals belonging to group 2 were sampled in a site characterised by a single line of riparian vegetation and large open areas, thereby representing once again a sort of structural ecotone inside an open area. According to literature, many species of group 2 are defined as ecotone species (Table S1) . Groups 3 and 4, on the other hand, which were negatively associated with open heath land and its ecotones, confirmed the decreasing importance of open areas while moving from group 1 to group 5. Indeed, species of group 5 were clearly associated with poplar plantations and sparse deciduous forests. Many species in group 5 were previously reported as being somehow linked to a forest environment (Table S1) , but some species are reported to be associated with very different habitats (from open grassland to forests) (Table S1 ). Additionally, the significant effect of the year in some groups showed a temporal shift in species abundance, suggesting population fluctuations depending on change in abiotic or biotic conditions. The degree of specialisation was not similar among species within groups in our studied assemblage. For example, Hipparchia statilinus was much more specialised than the other species of group 1, while Minois dryas frequented many more coppice deciduous forests and their ecotones than the other species of group 2. Two species of group 3 (Everes argiades and Aglais io), which in literature are reported as generalist species in many habitats including flowery bushy places, grassy banks, forest clearings, flowering meadows, forest edges and sheltered rocky gullies (Table S1 ), were very specialised in our study.

Thus, possible increased competition (i.e. a higher number of species sharing the same habitat requirements) would not increase habitat segregation, while a few highly specialised species would use a subset of habitats exploited by more generalist species. This consideration is consistent with previous network-based studies, which showed nestedness common in both mutualistic (e.g. plant-pollinator) networks (Bascompte et al., 2003) and agonistic (e.g. hostparasite) networks (Joppa et al., 2010) (although compartmentalisation is also observed in agonistic webs, e.g. Prado & Lewinsohn, 2004) . Bastolla et al. (2009) showed that the process by which a new species enters a community will likely lead to a nested pattern of interactions, because the new species tries to minimise its competitive Table 2 for species names).
