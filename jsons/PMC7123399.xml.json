            "text": "The first three-dimensional structure of the MERS-CoV spike glycoprotein receptor-binding domain (RBD), providing the molecular basis of viral attachment to host cells, was determined in the complex with it cellular receptor dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4, also called CD26) by X-ray crystallography [1]. Because of the significance in receptor recognition and specific pathogenesis, RBD became a hot spot in the study of MERS-CoV. A number of structures of RBD bound by monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have also been determined and deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB , http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/) [2\u20138]. Our group determined the RBD structures in complex with DPP4 and the mAbs MERS-27, MERS-4 and MERS-GD27, respectively [2\u20134, 9]. All the three-dimensional structures of MERS-CoV RBD have been determined by X-ray crystallography, which is a powerful method for determining molecular structures at atomic resolution. Briefly, the ordered and repeated atoms in a single protein crystal can diffract the incident X-ray beam into many specific directions. The angles and intensities of these diffracted X-rays can be collected and measured in an X-ray diffraction experiment. After obtaining the phases of these diffracted X-rays by heavy-atom derivative, anomalous scattering or molecular replacement methods, a protein crystallographer then calculates the density of electrons with the protein crystal and builds a structural model based on the density map. For details on the principles and methodology of protein crystallography, please refer to the range of other excellent textbooks.",

Incubate on ice for 30 min. Heat-shock the cells for 45 s at 42 \u00b0C without shaking. Immediately transfer the tubes onto ice and chill for 2 min. Add 500 \u03bcL of room temperature LB medium. Shake the tubes at 37 \u00b0C in incubator shaker for 4 h and then plate 20 \u03bcL of the cell suspension onto a bacmid selection LB agar plate. Incubate plates for 24\u201348 h at 37 \u00b0C, dark.Isolation of recombinant bacmid DNA: Pick a white colony from the bacmid selection LB agar plate, and inoculate 3 mL of liquid LB selection medium with the picked colony. Harvest the cells by centrifuging at 3000 \u00d7 g for 10 min, and then remove the entire medium. Add 250 \u03bcL of buffer P1 containing RNase A to the pellet, and resuspend the cells until the suspension is homogeneous. Transfer the cell suspension to a centrifuge tube. Add 250 \u03bcL buffer P2 and mix gently by inverting the capped tube several times. Incubate at room temperature for 5 min. Add 350 \u03bcL Buffer P3 and mix immediately by inverting the capped tube until the mixture is homogeneous. Centrifuge the mixture at 15,000 \u00d7 g at room temperature for 10 min. Transfer 800 \u03bcL of the supernatant into a 2 mL tube with 500 \u03bcL pre-chilled isopropanol at \u221220 \u00b0C for 20 min. Centrifuge the mixture at 15,000 \u00d7 g at 4 \u00b0C for 20 min.

Air-dry the pellet for 30 min. Resuspend the DNA pellet in 50 \u03bcL of sterile ultrapure water (see\nNote 8).Confirm the bacmid quality by separating the DNA on a 0.5% agarose gel. The bacmid is in the position nearest the gel hole. Verify the presence of the MERS-CoV RBD gene in the recombinant bacmid by PCR , using M13 forward and reverse primers (M13 F: CCCAGTCACGACGTTGTAAAACG; M13 R: AGCGGATAACAATTTCACACAGG; optional). Transfection of Sf9 cells: verify that the Sf9 cells are in the log phase (1.5\u20132.5 \u00d7 106 cells/mL) with greater than 95% viability. Add 2 \u00d7 106 cells into a 10 cm dish with 2 mL of culture medium (Sf-900 II Serum Free). Allow the cells to attach themselves for 30\u201360 min at room temperature in the hood. For the transfection sample, dilute 10 \u03bcL Cellfectin II Reagent in 250 \u03bcL of culture medium (Sf-900 II Serum Free).

Centrifuge the tube at 600 \u00d7 g for 5 min to remove cells and large debris. Transfer this clarified supernatant to a fresh 15-mL tube.Store this P0 virus stock at 4 \u00b0C, protected from light (see\nNote 10).Amplifying the baculovirus stock: On the day of infection, prepare an Sf9 cell suspension by seeding at 2 \u00d7 106 cells/mL in 50 mL of culture medium. Add 100 \u03bcL of P0 virus stock to the flask. Incubate the suspended cells for 72\u201396 h at 27 \u00b0C in incubator shaker. Transfer the medium containing the virions from the flask to a sterile 50-mL tube, and centrifuge the tube at 600 \u00d7 g for 5 min to clarify the baculovirus stock. Transfer the supernatant to a fresh collection tube. This is the P1 virus stock.Store this P1 virus stock at 4 \u00b0C, protected from light.

The baculovirus virions are generally added according to the virus to cell volume ratio of 1:100 and then the Sf9 cells are cultured at 27 \u00b0C in incubator shaker for 48\u201360 h.After transfection for 48\u201360 h, collect the cell-culture supernatant containing the MERS-CoV RBD by centrifugation at 3000 \u00d7 g for 15 min to remove cells, and pass the supernatant through a 0.45 \u03bcm filter, to avoid blocking the filter of the crossflow ultrafiltration system.For subsequent purification, concentrate large volumes of supernatant to a smaller volume. We used the Sartorius crossflow ultrafiltration system for concentration. When the volume is concentrated to about 50 mL, add 200 mL portions of HBS buffer (1 L in total) to the big beaker to exchange the buffer. When the total volume remaining is reduced to 50 mL, add 100 mL HBS buffer to collect all the liquid in the system in a beaker. Then dispense into high-speed centrifuge tubes, centrifuge at 3000 \u00d7 g for 1 h at 4 \u00b0C.The supernatant after centrifugation is loaded onto the nickel-NTA beads equilibrated with 30 mL of HBS buffer. MERS-CoV RBD with a His tag could be captured by nickel-NTA beads. Repeat loading the sample once more.Add wash buffer to the beads to remove the nonspecifically bound proteins until the flow-through is not able to discolor the Coomassie Brilliant Blue G250 solution.After adding elution buffer, the target protein will dissociate from the beads; collect it in a 10 kDa Millipore concentrating tube. Similarly, detect protein with Coomassie Brilliant Blue G250. The concentrating tube containing the protein sample is centrifuged at 3000 \u00d7 g to concentrate the sample to less than 1 mL. Transfer the sample to a 1.5 mL EP tube and centrifuge at 3000 \u00d7 g for 10 min.MERS-CoVRBD is further purified by gel filtration chromatography. The sample is loaded onto the Superdex 200 column pre-equilibrated with HBS buffer. Fractions containing RBD are collected and the protein\u2019s purity is confirmed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2).Dilute the protein to 1 mg/mL, and digest with endoglycosidase F1 and F3 (F1/F3: RBD at the ratio of 1:100) at 18 \u00b0C overnight. The digested protein is concentrated and purified by gel filtration chromatography same as above (optional).After preparing the MERS-CoV RBD protein and MERS-4scFv protein (see\nNote 11) detect the absorption of the protein sample at 280 nm (A280). According to the molecular weight and extinction coefficient, the molar concentration can be calculated. The two proteins were mixed at molar ratio of 1:1, incubated on ice for 1 h, and purified using a Superdex 200 column. Collect the fractions containing the complex and confirm the protein purity by SDS-PAGE.\n\n",

Use the \u2217.mtz file to calculate the solvent via MATTHEWS_COEF.

After sterilization by high-pressure steam, wait until the temperature of the medium drops to about 60 \u00b0C, add the required antibiotics, inducers etc. (50 \u03bcg/mL kanamycin,7 \u03bcg/mL gentamicin, 10 \u03bcg/mL tetracycline, 100 \u03bcg/mL x-gal, 40 \u03bcg/mL IPTG). Mix evenly and then pour into sterile plates. When the culture medium has cooled and solidified, store the bacmid selection LB agar plate at 4 \u00b0C.TIANprep Mini Plasmid Kit includes Buffers P1, P2, and P3. We only use the Buffers P1, P2, and P3 for the preceding steps of isolating recombinant bacmid DNA.Method for preparing HBS buffer: Prepare 10\u00d7 HBS buffer (100 mM HEPES, 1500 mM NaCl). Weigh 23.8 g HEPES (Sigma), 87.66 g NaCl (Amresco) dissolve with water to 1 L, adjust pH to 7.2 with NaOH. Then, dilute 100 mL of 10\u00d7 HBS buffer with 900 mL of water.Method of preparing wash buffer: First prepare 5 M imidazole. Weigh 340 g imidazole (Sigma-Aldrich, USA), add water to 1 L and use HCl to adjust pH to 8.0. Add 100 mL 10\u00d7 HBS buffer, 30 mL 5 M imidazole with water to 1 L.Method of preparing Coomassie brilliant blue G-250: Weigh 1 g G-250 (Solarbio), add 100 mL 85% phosphate, 100 mL anhydrous ethanol and water to 1 L. The G-250 needs to be stored away from light.Endoglycosidase F1 and F3 are expressed and purified from E. coli by our laboratory. The endoglycosidase was added into the reaction system according to the mass ratio of 1:100.The coding sequence of the MERS-CoV RBD (EMC strain, spike residues 367\u2013588) was ligated into the pFastBac-Dual vector (Invitrogen) with a N-terminal gp67 signal peptide to enable the protein secreting outside the cell and a C-terminal His-tag to facilitate further purification processes.Allow the pellet to dissolve for at least 10 min at room temperature. To avoid shearing the DNA, pipet only 1\u20132 times to resuspend. Store the bacmid at 4 \u00b0C and use it as soon as possible, usually within 1 week. Aliquot the bacmid DNA into separate tubes and store at \u221220 \u00b0C (not in a frost-free fridge). Avoid multiple freeze/thaw cycles as this decreases the transfection efficiency.Characteristics of infected cells: A 25\u201350% increase in cell diameter can be seen and the size of cell nuclei increases at the early stage. Cells release from the plate and appear lysed, showing signs of clearing in the monolayer.P0 virus can be stored for years, adding 2% (v/v) FBS at 4 \u00b0C, protected from light.The expression of MERS-4scFv protein was conducted in 293F cells transiently transfected with plasmid DNA. After 72 h, the supernatant was collected and concentrated. The purified MERS-4scFv protein was obtained by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography and Superdex 200 size-exclusion chromatography. The purification method is the same as that of RBD protein.If the crystal structure of the same protein or a similar protein has been solved, the molecular replacement method can be applied. After obtaining the solutions of the rotation and translation functions, initial phases can be calculated from the reference model, after which the electron density can be calculated.The accuracy of the constructed model is confirmed by the crystallographic R-factor and R-free, which indicate the discrepancy between the calculated and observed amplitudes. The stereo-chemical parameters of the model can also be checked using programs such as MOLPROBITY, PROCHECK, or RAMPAGE.\n",
