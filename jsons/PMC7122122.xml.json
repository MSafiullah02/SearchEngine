Here comes the example of Hannibal (from Carthago), leading the ships of Prusia I, king of Bithynia (West Turkey) in a battle of year 184 b.C. against Eumene II (Attalides, Pergamon); he won that naval battle because he managed to throw canisters full of reptiles at the enemy ships, causing terror and uncoordinated reactions leading to his victory. He therefore used fear as a weapon: snakes were not even harmful (not poisonous), but big was the surprise and reactions were out of control!In recent history, we can see that First World War (also named the war of Chemistry) contributed to the development and use of Nervine gases, chemical weapons banned everywhere but still existing in some countries. Second World War (also named the war of Physics) led to the development and use of the atomic bomb.\n\n",

Examples in time recall the cases of the highly lethal pandemics known as \u201cSpanish flu\u201d in 1917\u20131918 (in excess of 40 million deaths worldwide), \u201cAsian flu\u201d in 1956 (in excess of 100,000 deaths worldwide) and \u201cHong Kong flu\u201d in 1978 (in excess of 700,000 deaths worldwide).
