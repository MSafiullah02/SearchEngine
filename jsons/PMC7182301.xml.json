The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that measles vaccination programs alone have prevented over 21.1 million deaths globally between 2000 and 2017. Nevertheless, measles are still among the leading causes of childhood mortality worldwide [1]. However, especially in industrialized countries, it seems as though vaccines are about to become a victim of their own success where regionally successful vaccination programs have rendered the respective disease virtually unknown to the protected group [2]. As the general public typically does not witness the devastating manifestations of vaccine-preventable infectious diseases anymore, the consequences of contracting such a disease are often underestimated, and adherence to vaccination programs tends to diminish. This has led the WHO to list vaccine hesitancy among the top ten threats to global health in 2019.",

This global imbalance is particularly ethically relevant, as vaccine-preventable communicable diseases may be exported from financially prosperous countries with good medical infrastructure via global migration, tourism, and trade to countries less equipped to deal with outbreaks (for instance due to problems in vaccine coverage and limited treatment options for infectious diseases). Thus, low-income countries are disproportionately affected and are far more likely to suffer serious repercussions. This situation is exacerbated by an often worse disease outcome due to prevalent malnutrition and pre-existing chronic health conditions such as tuberculosis and HIV. Consequently, neglect or refusal to be vaccinated for non-medical reasons in countries where safe and efficient measles vaccines are easily available, does not only compromise herd immunity locally, but also fails to protect more vulnerable populations globally.",

All health care authorities are obliged to provide the means to do so, and if unable from their own resources, with access to supranational support. In this context, the implementation of vaccination policies with the aim of permanent global disease eradication, fulfilling the demands of transgenerational justice, should follow an equity-based framework of international burden sharing, with wealthy countries making proportionately higher financial and logistic contributions.",

Whether to apply sanctions to \u201cnon-vaxxers\u201d (due to non-medical reasons) or doctors who refuse to vaccinate, (like in some eastern European countries), or whether to reward vaccination financially (as practiced in Australia through tax benefits) or whether to exclude non-vaccinated persons, particularly children, from public institutions (as done in Italy, France, and Germany) is a decision which can only be reached taking into account the individual legal, cultural, and ethical circumstances of the given situation. However, a mandatory vaccination policy for certain occupational groups at increased risk of contracting vaccine-preventable infectious diseases certainly makes sense. Incompliance of such professionals could be sanctioned with the withdrawal of their work permit or title.
