However, Medical imaging is of great significance in the detection and surveillance of COVID-19 infection. Recently, the studies demonstrated that the CT findings were typical signs for diagnosis at different stages of COVID-19 pneumonia. 3 , 4 Particularly, ground glass opacities (GGO) and consolidation were the principal manifestation in the CT images (CT scans before onset of symptoms or CT scans done \u2264 1 week after symptom onset), and GGO was decreased with increasing the stages of COVID-19 pneumonia. However, the consolidation or GGO mixed consolidation increased, and reticular was also observed in the later stages (scan > 1 week after symptom onset). Pleural effusion or lymphadenopathy was rarely seen. 4 CT features were distributed primarily in the lower lobes and subpleural (especially in the right lower lobe), 4 , 5 with rapid evolution from focal unilateral pulmonary parenchyma to diffuse bilateral GGO or GGO with consolidation within 1-3 weeks. 4 Therefore, knowing the corresponding CT feature of COVID-19 pneumonia at different stages, which could be helpful to precisely diagnose and understand CT characteristics of the novel coronavirus pneumonia beyond the radiological findings itself.",
