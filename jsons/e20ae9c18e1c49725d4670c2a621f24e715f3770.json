The health care institutions have actively participated in the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of the disease. Proper regulation of inhospital policy may help control virus spreading. We developed seven key clinical questions about the prevention and control of 2019-novel coronavirus infection in a hospital, and provided recommendations based on the best available evidence and expert experience. We interpret the recommendations for better feasibility in Chinese hospital. We hope to provide evidence and reference for the domestic medical institutions to reasonably adjust the hospital workflow during 2019-nCoV infection period.",

To control further spread of the coronavirus, a first-level public health emergency response was launched [1] . The current preliminary evidence indicates human-to-human transmission of 2019-nCoV from person to person mainly in droplets and contact. The population is generally susceptible to this coronavious, and the proportion of severe cases is appreciable, but the transmission mechanism requires further study [2] [3] [4] . The chairs convened an urgent meeting with the clinical and methods expert committees. At the meeting, the specific clinical demands based on clinical work status were put forward through discussion, then were translated by the team into specific clinical questions following PICO principles under the guidance of the methods chairs.",

An observational study of the SARS epidemic in Hong Kong revealed that 69 medical staff who strictly enforced isolation requirements were not infected, and that all infected medical staff ignored at least one isolation requirement. Therefore droplet isolation and contact isolation may significantly reduce the risk of nosocomial infections among medical staff after exposure to SARS patients [25] . One systematic review showed that aerosol-generating procedures (e.g., endotracheal tube insertion, tracheostomy, mechanical ventilation, and bronchoscopy) increase the risk of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV transmission [26] . Based on the requirements of the \"WHO Infection Prevention and Control for Suspected Cases Infected by Novel Coronavirus in Hospitals\" [27] and the opinion of our clinical expert committee, standard prevention measures should be adopted for all hospitalized patients during the 2019-nCoV epidemic, including hand hygiene, personal protection, respiratory hygiene, needlestick prevention, cleaning of medical supplies, and disposal of medical waste. Droplet and contact precautions are recommended in addition to standard precautions for patients with suspected or diagnosed 2019-nCoV, and air precautions may be necessary for procedures that generate aerosols. Gastrointestinal tract isolation may also be needed.",

Such suspensions have been widely adopted during many epidemics [29, 30] , but their improper application can have negative psychosocial impacts, interrupt communication, and reduce the level of care [28] . Therefore hospitals should assess the risk of psychosomatic damage to patients according to their actual condition when formulating the temporary visit suspension policy. Qualitative research suggests that patients during the SARS epidemic were understanding of visit restrictions, but healthcare staff should still pay attention to patients and their families when explaining such policies in order to maintain the quality of the patient's medical experience and avoid physician-patient conflicts [31] .

He said that all relevant departments and local governments should bear strong responsibility for the health of the masses, and should improve their response plans and do their best to prevent and control the contagion [5]. During the epidemic, patients admitted to large general hospitals have presented with confirmed or suspected pneumonia but also other diseases, so detailed guidelines for 2019-nCoV control and prevention in hospitals are needed to protect the health of patients and healthcare workers. This study adopted the urgent recommendation model of the West China recommendation system based on the methods of evidence-based medicine and the best relevant worldwide evidence in the shortest possible time. Combined with clinical and management experience, the present recommendations for infection control of 2019-nCoV in hospitals serve to help deploy and utilize available resources as rationally as possible as well as ensure the safe, efficient hospital admission of patients to minimize risk of in-hospital virus transmission in the interests of public health and the selection and recruitment of the panel members Weimin Li and Zhiyong Zong, as Clinical Chairs, suggested the topic of this urgent recommendation based on the needs of the situation. The Methods Chairs Xin Sun and Sheyu Li of the Chinese Evidence-based Medicine Center and MAGIC China Center [6] support the methodology of this urgent recommendation. 2.2 Establishment of an expert committee and definition of clinical questions Clinical chairs coordinated the recruitment and establishment of a clinical expert committee according to the needs of the topic selection and the actual situation. The clinical expert committee recruited members who (1) were engaged in a professional field highly relevant to these urgent recommendations, or who fully understood the actual needs of the recommendation users; (2) were willing and able to participate in the development of recommendations; (3) do not have key conflicts of interest related to the recommendation topics; and (4) had a background in evidence-based medicine or were willing to work in accordance with it.

They have been formulated through urgent review of the evidence and evidence-based recommendations while taking into account actual situations in hospitals. All recommendations were coordinated with West China Hospital in parallel with their formulation, and were implemented hospital-wide with a supporting implementation platform. These urgent recommendations were completed within one week from proposal of the clinical questions to establishment of multidisciplinary teams and finalization of the recommendations. These recommendations are based on the most recent literature and include practical adjustments, ensuring their timeliness. The process of generating these urgent recommendations may provide a reference for evidence-based decision-making in future public health emergencies. However, these urgent recommendations have limitations. (1) The urgency of the task meant that the clinical expert committee was not fully balanced in terms of region, professional background, or gender. All clinical experts were from the same institution.In addition, during formulation of these recommendations, some committee members had to excuse themselves to attend to urgent epidemic-related work, and substitute workers had to be organized.(2) Time constraints meant that clinical questions were selected after only one round of discussions, before which members of the clinical expert committee did not have the opportunity to conduct an adequate literature review or prepare potential questions. (Similarly, they did not have time to undergo full methodological training.) As a result, questions related to pre-screening triage and close contact management, for example, are not covered in these recommendations. If time and resources permit, the project team will supplement and update these and other key issues in the prevention and control of 2019-nCoV infections. (3) A systematic review of the literature was not conducted before the recommendations were developed. Nevertheless, the research team searched rapidly for the highest-quality, most relevant literature through the reasonable allocation of clinical and methods expert resources. The team searched not only peer-reviewed databases but also official websites, which should be updated in real time, guaranteeing the reliability and timeliness of retrieved evidence. (4) The currently limited understanding of 2019-nCoV infection means that the levels of evidence and therefore recommendation levels are genereally low. Original research is needed in order to develop more reliable recommendations. Our urgent recommendations are as follows. (1) When 2019-nCoV infections occur, hospitals should establish a HICS as soon as possible. (2) We recommend that hospitals adopt the diagnostic criteria of suspected or confirmed cases in the \"2019-nCoV Infected Pneumonitis Diagnosis and Treatment Protocol (Fourth Edition)\" [4]. (Note: the Sixth Edition of this protocol is now available.)
