The replication of vRNAs and the transcription of viral mRNAs are catalysed by the viral polymerase complex, which is composed of the PB2, PB1 and PA subunits. The viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity is encoded by the PB1 protein. The PB2 protein binds to the cap structure of host pre-mRNAs; the endonuclease activity of PA then cleaves the cap structure and the adjacent nucleotides from cellular pre-mRNAs, thereby creating short, capped mRNA primers that are elongated by PB1 for viral mRNA synthesis. All three polymerase subunits, together with the nucleoprotein (NP), are required for efficient influenza virus replication.",

            "text": "The haemagglutinin (HA) surface glycoprotein and the polymerase complex affect the host range of influenza viruses7,8,9,10,11,12. The HA proteins of avian influenza viruses bind preferentially to \u03b12,3-linked sialic acids, which are predominantly expressed on epithelial cells in the intestinal tract of aquatic birds8. By contrast, human influenza viruses bind preferentially to \u03b12,6-linked sialic acids, which are prevalent on epithelial cells in the upper human airway8. In addition to HA-mediated host range restriction, the polymerase complex of avian influenza viruses is often restricted in its replicative ability in mammalian cells. This host range restriction may be a consequence of polymerase interactions with host-specific cellular proteins, and/or temperature differences between the intestinal tract of birds (38\u201341 \u00b0C) and the upper respiratory tract of mammals (33 \u00b0C). We13 and others14 identified the amino acid at position 627 of PB2 as a major host range determinant of influenza A viruses. In addition, the amino acids at positions 591 (refs 15, 16) and 701 (refs 17, 18) of PB2 affect the replication of avian influenza viruses in mammals. Moreover, other mutations in PB2, PB1 and PA also influence the host range of influenza viruses; examples include PB2-147T/339T/588T (ref. 19), PB2-271A (ref. 20), PB2-158G (ref. 21), PB1-13L/678S (ref. 18) and PA-97I (ref. 22).",

Although such studies led to the identification of host range determinants such as PB2-627, -591 and -701N, there may be additional, currently unknown amino-acid changes in the polymerase proteins that affect host range. The testing of all possible amino-acid changes in the polymerase proteins is not feasible; hence, no systematic efforts have been undertaken to catalogue potentially mammalian-adapting mutations in the viral polymerase complex. Therefore, in the present study, we implemented a high-throughput, reporter gene-based screening approach that allows the testing of large numbers of polymerase mutants. By using this approach, we identified several mutations in an avian H5N1 polymerase complex that increase polymerase activity in mammalian cells and virulence in mice.",

We generated a biologically contained virus that possesses the viral polymerase (PB2, PB1 and PA) and NP RNA segments of the avian H5N1 A/Muscovy duck/Vietnam/TY93/2007 (TY93/H5N1) virus (Clade 2.3.4), the viral NA, M and NS RNA segments of the laboratory-adapted A/WSN/33 (WSN; H1N1) virus, and a modified WSN HA RNA segment in which most of the open reading frame of HA was replaced with that of the reporter protein green fluorescent protein (GFP; essentially as described before in ref. 23; Fig. 1a). The replication of this virus is restricted to a cell line that stably expresses the HA protein. The TY93/H5N1 PB2 protein of this virus (termed TY93/H5N1 GFP-627E) encodes glutamic acid at position 627, which restricts the replicative ability of avian H5N1 virus polymerase complexes in mammals13. As a control virus, we generated TY93/H5N1 GFP-627K encoding the PB2-E627K mutation known to increase the replicative ability of avian influenza virus polymerase complexes in mammalian cells13. The replication-incompetent TY93/H5N1 GFP-627E and -E627 K viruses can be propagated in cell lines expressing the WSN-HA protein, but do not replicate in wild-type cells (Fig. 1b). The University of Wisconsin-Madison Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC) approved work with these viruses in BSL-2 containment.",

Five hours later, we subjected cells to fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis.

To generate large numbers of mutants, each polymerase gene was divided into four regions of \u223c150\u2013200 amino acids; for example, we divided the PA gene into regions encoding amino acids 1\u2013186, 187\u2013328, 329\u2013574 and 575\u2013716 (Fig. 1c). All 12 polymerase fragments were amplified with an error-prone polymerase, resulting in 1\u20132 random amino-acid changes per amplified region. For the PB1 and PA genes, we then mixed the four randomly mutated complementary DNA libraries of each gene, resulting in PA and PB1 plasmid libraries. For PB2, we mixed the three libraries possessing mutations at positions 1\u2013207, 208\u2013394 and 395\u2013587, resulting in a PB2 plasmid library with mutations at amino-acid positions 1\u2013587. The C-terminal library encoding mutations at positions 588\u2013759 of PB2 was not combined with the other three PB2 libraries because many of the mutations known to enhance the polymerase activity in mammalian cells (such as PB2-Q591K, -E627K and D701N) are located in this region. By using reverse genetics (Fig. 1b), we then used the complementary DNA libraries to generate four different virus libraries that possess several random amino-acid mutations in PB2(1\u2013587), PB2(588\u2013759), PB1 and PA (Fig. 2).

For these 90 viruses, we performed deep-sequencing analysis of the polymerase and NP genes; NP was included because it also affects influenza virus replication25. We focused on mutations that were found in at least 30% of the sequence reads, which were detected in 66 viruses, namely in 11/20, 30/30, 12/20 and 13/20 of the viruses isolated from the TY93/H5N1 PB2(1\u2013587), PB2(588\u2013759), PB1 and PA mutant virus libraries (Supplementary Tables 2\u20135). The remaining viruses (selected on the basis of M RNA levels higher than those detected for the parental virus) may possess mutations in the remaining viral genes not analysed here. Most of the mutations detected in the TY93/H5N1 PB2(588\u2013759) library affected the amino acid at position 627; the known mammalian-adapting mutation PB2-E627K was found in 13 of 30 viruses, and the PB2-E627V mutation (the most frequently detected mutation in the pilot study) was found in 9 of 30 viruses. In addition, we detected the known mammalian-adapting mutations PB2-Q591K and PB2-D701N in one and three virus samples, respectively. Interestingly, an appreciable number of viruses possessed mutations in regions not targeted by random mutagenesis (for example, viruses isolated from the TY93/H5N1 PB1 virus library also possessed mutations in NP or PA); in fact, several viruses isolated from the TY93/H5N1 PB1 or PA libraries did not possess mutations in these genes, but rather in NP, albeit at a relatively low frequency (Supplementary Tables 4 and 5). Mutations outside the region targeted for mutagenesis may have emerged during replication in mammalian cells, and may thus play a role in the adaptation of avian virus polymerase complexes to mammalian cells. In samples with >1 mutation, some mutations occurred with similar frequency, whereas the prevalence of others differed greatly. For example, sample no. 13 of the TY93/H5N1 PA library encodes PA T97I and Y232C mutations at a prevalence of 87% and 85%, respectively; in addition, this virus sample possesses PA F612I and S648N mutations that were found in 30% of the sequence reads (Supplementary Table 5). This finding may indicate that the T97I and Y232C mutations arose first, followed by the F612I and S648N mutations. These findings might also suggest a functional relationship between T97I and Y232C, and between F612I and S648N.",

For further analyses, we focused on mutations that fulfilled at least one of the following criteria: (i) Mutations with a prevalence of \u226530% based on deep-sequencing analysis (Supplementary Tables 2\u20135); (ii) Mutations identified in human H5N1 virus sequences deposited in the Influenza Research Database ( http://www.fludb.org; accessed 1 September 2012); or (iii) Mutations located outside the region targeted for mutagenesis (for example, a mutation in PA isolated from the TY93/H5N1 PB1 mutant virus library). Based on these criteria, we selected 96 single, double or triple mutations in the polymerase and NP genes (Supplementary Data 1) for further characterization. Our GFP-FACS screens were carried out with HA-deficient virus maintained in HA-expressing cells. To test the effects of the selected mutations on influenza viruses that could replicate in normal cells, we introduced the mutations into a recombinant H5N1 virus. For biosafety reasons, the recombinant H5N1 virus possessed the TY93/H5N1 polymerase and NP genes in combination with the HA, NA, M and NS genes from A/Vietnam/1203/2004 (H5N1) virus; the HA gene of this virus has been modified to replace the multibasic sequence at the HA cleavage site with a single basic amino acid that renders the virus low pathogenic. We were able to introduce 85 of the selected mutations into replicating virus; however, 11 mutants could not be generated (Supplementary Data 1). To test the replicative ability of the 85 mutant viruses in mammalian cells, we infected human 293 cells (used because the GFP-FACS screens were carried out in this cell line) at an MOI of 0.001, and incubated them at 33 and 37 \u00b0C (that is, the respective temperatures of the upper and lower respiratory tract of mammals). At 24, 48 and 72 h post infection, supernatants were harvested and viral replication was assessed by means of plaque assays in MDCK cells. Most mutations that conferred increased replication to the recombinant H5N1 virus in human cells were located in the C-terminal portion of PB2 (Supplementary Data 1), consistent with the role of this region in the host range and virulence of influenza viruses15,18,26. Among these mutations were the known mammalian-adapting PB2-Q591K, -E627K and -D701N changes; however, we also identified additional mutations in this region (such as PB2-E627V and -D701V) that increased the replicative ability of the recombinant H5N1 virus in humans cells. Moreover, several mutations in PB1 and PA increased the replication of the H5N1 virus in human cells at 33 and/or 37 \u00b0C (Supplementary Data 1). Based on the viral growth properties in human 293 cells, the following 11 mutations were selected for further characterization: PA-T97I, PB1-N105S, PB2-E192K, -Q591K, -E627K, -E627V, -D701N, -D701V, -K702R, -D740N and -I758T (the PB2-Q591K, -E627K and -D701N mutations are known to enhance the replicative ability of avian H5N1 viruses in mammals13,14,15,16,17,27 but were included here for comparison with the potentially novel markers of mammalian adaptation).",

Wild-type TY93/H5N1 virus did not replicate to detectable levels in A549 cells at 33 \u00b0C (Fig. 3a), underscoring the limited ability of avian H5N1 viruses to replicate in human cells at the temperature of the upper respiratory tract. By contrast, several mutations conferred this ability, demonstrating their growth-enhancing effect in mammalian cells. At 37 \u00b0C, the PB2-627V and -701V mutants replicated to significantly higher titres than wild-type TY93/H5N1 virus at 24 h post infection (Fig. 3a and Table 1). The PB2-E627K and PB2-D701N mutations are known to facilitate adaptation of avian influenza viruses to mammals13,18,26, but the replication-enhancing effect in mammalian cells of the PB2-627V and -701V residues had not been described. In 293 and Calu-3 cells, TY93/H5N1 virus replicated to appreciable levels at 33 and 37 \u00b0C (Supplementary Fig. 2); similar to results obtained in A549 cells, most mutations increased the replicative ability of TY93/H5N1 at one or both temperatures tested (Supplementary Fig. 2 and Table 1).",

In mammalian cells, the higher virus titres detected for these mutants (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Fig. 2) typically correlated with higher polymerase activity in minireplicon assays at 33 and/or 37 \u00b0C (Fig. 4a,b and Table 1). The PB2-K702R and -D740N mutations did not have appreciable effects on polymerase activity in minireplicon assays, even though they conferred higher virus titres in A549 cells (Fig. 3 and Table 1). The relative increases in mammalian cells compared with wild-type TY93/H5N1 replicative ability were greater at 33 \u00b0C than at 37 \u00b0C, most likely as a consequence of the low polymerase activity of TY93/H5N1 in mammalian cells at 33 \u00b0C (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Fig. 2). In avian DF-1 cells, several mutations including PB2-E192K, -Q591K, -E627K and -D740N conferred increased polymerase activity at 33 \u00b0C compared with TY93/H5N1 (Fig. 4 and Table 1); however, these increases in polymerase activity did not result in increased virus titres in DF-1 cells (Fig. 3b and Table 1). Together, these data indicate that there is not always a strict correlation between replicative ability in minireplicon assays (which assess viral RNA replication and transcription) and virus titres (which reflect the entire viral life cycle). This is consistent with our earlier findings19 and suggests that some of the mutations may affect steps in the viral life cycle other than vRNA transcription and/or replication, such as the nuclear export of viral ribonucleoprotein complexes.",

Next, we tested whether these increases translated to higher virulence in mice.

All mutant viruses (with the exception of TY93/H5N1 PB2-D740N) had a lower MLD50 value than that of the wild-type virus, demonstrating increased virulence in mice compared with TY93/H5N1 virus. The greatest virulence in mice was detected for the PB1-N105S and PB2-E192K mutants, for which infection with one plaque-forming unit (p.f.u.) resulted in such severe clinical symptoms that all (for PB1-N105S) or two (PB2-E192K) of the infected mice had to be euthanized. The PB1-N105S mutant did not significantly increase the TY93/H5N1 polymerase activity in minireplicon assays (Fig. 4), again suggesting that the polymerase mutations influence steps beyond vRNA replication and transcription. We also found that the newly identified PB2-627V and -701V mutations had MLD50 values identical to those of the known PB2-627 K and -701 N mutants, respectively (Supplementary Table 6). Mice infected with these viruses succumbed rapidly to infection (Fig. 5).",

Virus titres in the organs of infected mice were assessed by use of plaque assays in MDCK cells. On day 3 post infection, several mutant viruses replicated to higher titres than wild-type virus in the nasal turbinates and/or lungs of infected mice (Fig. 6 and Table 1), consistent with increased replicative ability in virus-infected cells (Fig. 3) and/or in minireplicons (Fig. 4). Some of these mutants were also detected in the brains of infected mice (Fig. 6). On day 5 post infection, the titres of wild-type and most mutant viruses were comparable in the lungs and nasal turbinates (Fig. 6 and Table 1). The PB2-740N mutant was not isolated from nasal turbinates, even though it replicated efficiently in the lungs of infected mice. Virus titres in the brains of infected mice differed greatly on day 5 post infection, ranging from undetectable to >106 p.f.u. per g for mice infected with PB2-701N, and >107 p.f.u. per g for a mouse infected with PB2-701V.

            "text": "By using a high-throughput screening approach, we identified several mutations in an avian H5N1 influenza virus polymerase complex that increase the replicative ability and virulence of the virus, and may facilitate avian influenza virus adaptation to mammals. Previous studies to identify mutations that promote mammalian adaptation and increase the virulence of avian influenza viruses have typically relied on the experimental and/or computational identification of signature amino-acid mutations found in natural isolates28,29,30, or on sequential virus passages in mice24,31,32, ferrets33 or swine34 (an approach known to increase virulence). However, sequential passages of avian H5N1 influenza viruses in mammals often lead to the selection of the dominant PB2-E627K (refs 35, 36, 37) mutation, which may mask the emergence of other adaptive mutations. The identification of host-adaptive mutations through sequence analysis is typically challenging because the observed mutations may be random and not associated with any adaptive advantage. To circumvent these potential drawbacks, we utilized a random mutagenesis approach to create a large pool of diverse mutants, followed by a screening process for variants that replicate efficiently in mammalian cells. This approach led us to identify specific mutations in the polymerase complex that, to the best of our knowledge, have never been reported as mammalian-adapting mutations, namely PB2-E192K, -E627V, -D701V, -K702R and PB1-N105S.",

            "text": "Glutamic acid is typically found at position 627 of PB2 in avian influenza viruses. Most human influenza viruses, with the exception of the 2009 pandemic H1N1 viruses, encode lysine at this position. Replication of avian influenza viruses in mice or humans frequently leads to the emergence of the PB2-E627K mutation26,38,39,40,41. Lysine at position 627 is part of a basic patch at the surface of PB2, which is disrupted by a glutamic acid residue at this position42,43. This patch may be essential for the interaction of PB2 with host factors. The valine residue at position 627 of PB2 would result in a slightly basic surface patch. The PB2-627V mutation increased viral replication in mammalian cells and virulence in mice compared with PB2-627E; in fact, the replicative ability and virulence of TY93/H5N1 encoding PB2-627V were comparable to that of the virus encoding the mammalian-adapting PB2-627 K residue. A recent study found that the PB2-627V mutation slightly reduced replicative ability in vitro compared with PB2-627K (ref. 44); however, this study was carried out in the background of the cell culture-adapted A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (H1N1) virus. Although we found that TY93/H5N1 viruses encoding PB2-627K or -627V have comparable replicative ability and mouse virulence, the PB2-627V variant is rarely found in natural influenza isolates. To date, it has only been detected in a single H7N9 human isolate (A/Hong Kong/5731/2014), five H1N1 swine isolates, a single H7N1 avian isolate (A/Pekin robin/California/30412/1994) and in several H9N2 isolates from poultry farms in Egypt and Israel between 2000 and 2013; ref. 45). We speculate that the type of nucleotide mutation may contribute to the selection of PB2-E627K over PB2-E627V: glutamic acid can mutate to lysine with a transition mutation in the first position (G to A); by contrast, the conversion of glutamic acid to valine requires a transversion mutation (GAG to GTG). Transition mutations are (de)aminations, whereas transversions require an exchange between a pyrimidine and a purine structure. Consequently, the transition:transversion ratio is reported to be \u223c10:1 (refs 46, 47). This result highlights an advantage of our approach: by starting with error-prone PCR-generated virus libraries possessing random mutations, we were able to identify a novel putative mammalian-adapting mutation that had not been identified through surveillance or virus passages, likely due to its rare occurrence.",

Our experimental data support this concept: TY93/H5N1 encoding PB2-702R replicated efficiently in mammalian cells and in the lungs of infected animals, and its MLD50 value was lower than that of wild-type TY93/H5N1 virus (encoding PB2-702K).

In parallel, the manuscript was submitted to the University of Wisconsin-Madison DURC Subcommittee and their findings were presented to the University of Wisconsin-Madison IBC and the University of Wisconsin-Madison Biosecurity Task Force (BTF). The University of Wisconsin-Madison BTF regularly reviews the research programme and ongoing laboratory activities. The task force has a diverse skill set and provides support in the areas of biosafety, facilities, research compliance, security, law, healthcare and public health. Members of the BTF are in frequent contact with the Select Agent Program, the principal investigators and laboratory personnel to provide oversight and assure biosecurity. All three panels (that is, the UW-IBC, UW-DURC Subcommittee and UW-BTF) concluded that this study constitutes DURC, but that proper risk mitigation strategies were followed and that the data should be published in full.",

Staff working in BSL3Ag wear disposable overalls and powered air-purifying respirators that filter the air, and shower out on exit from the facility. The BSL3Ag facility at the University of Wisconsin-Madison was designed to exceed the standards outlined in Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories (5th edition; http://www.cdc.gov/biosafety/publications/bmbl5/BMBL.pdf). Features include controlled access, entry/exit through a shower change room, effluent decontamination, negative air-pressure, double-door autoclaves, gas decontamination ports, plus HEPA-filtered supply and double-HEPA-filtered exhaust air, double-gasketed watertight and airtight seals, airtight dampers on all ductwork, and the structure is pressure-decay tested regularly. The University of Wisconsin-Madison facility has a dedicated alarm system that monitors all building controls and sends alarms (\u223c500 possible alerts). Redundancies and emergency resources are built-in to the facility including two air handlers, two compressors, two filters in each location where filters are needed, two effluent sterilization tanks, two power feeds to the building, an emergency generator in case of a power failure and other physical containment measures in the facility that operate without power. Biosecurity monitoring of the facility is ongoing. All personnel undergo Select Agent security risk assessment by the United States Criminal Justice Information Services Division and complete rigorous biosafety, BSL3 and Select Agent training before participating in BSL3-level experiments. Refresher training, including drills and review of emergency plans, is scheduled on a regular basis. The principal investigator participates in training sessions and emphasizes compliance to maintain safe operations and a responsible research environment. The laboratory occupational health plan is in compliance with the University of Wisconsin-Madison Occupational Medicine Program. Select Agent virus inventory, secured behind two physical barriers, is checked each month and documentation is submitted to the University of Wisconsin-Madison Select Agent Program Manager. Updates on virus inventory (which is carried out every month) are submitted 1\u20132 times per year to the file holder in the Select Agent branch of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The research programme, procedures, occupational health plan, documentation, security and facilities are reviewed annually by the University of Wisconsin-Madison Responsible Official and at regular intervals by the CDC, and the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service as part of the University of Wisconsin-Madison Select Agent Program.",
