The second step in the assay employs reverse transcription and amplification using a real time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) instrumentation. The assay therefore requires two kits, one for extraction and another for amplification of the target and detection. We investigated whether a strategy used in the testing of blood prior to transfusion could have application for conservation of scarce reagents for the SARS CoV-2 assay. 4, 5 The process of group testing that employs sample pooling is used for detection of the human immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis B and C viruses 4 in blood products. Key principles for successful application of group testing involve knowledge of the limit-of-detection, sensitivity, and specificity of the assay, and the prevalence of disease in the population. The goal of the process is to determine a pool size that provides the greatest conservation of resources while maintaining the reliable performance of testing. This report describes a proof-of-concept for group testing of pooled specimens for the diagnosis of COVID-19.",
