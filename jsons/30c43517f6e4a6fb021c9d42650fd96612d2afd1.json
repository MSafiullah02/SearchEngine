UK guidelines limit its use to 'at risk' individuals who have not been vaccinated or in outbreak situations in closed communities and it must be used within 48 hr of symptom onset or contact, thus preventing its use in the community at large [National Institute for Clinical Excellence, 2003].

As influenza has an RNA genome, reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) has been the technique of choice, usually targeting either the hemagluttinin or neuraminidase gene to enable further virus subtyping. RT-PCR can be multiplexed to detect more than one target in a single reaction. Influenza multiplex assays have been reported that can differentiate influenza A from B and influenza A H3 from H1, reducing both time and overall costs of diagnosis [Stockton et al., 1998; Ellis and Zambon, 2002; Hibbitts and Fox, 2002] . The disadvantage of RT-PCR methods (compared with direct PCR of DNA targets) is that the RT step is often performed separately from the PCR, increasing both assay time and the risk of contamination. This issue has been somewhat resolved with the development of real-time RT-PCR systems; however, in many systems the RT step is again performed independently from PCR [Schweiger et al., 2000; van Elden et al., 2000; Ellis and Zambon, 2002] .",

Unlike traditional PCR, the amplification step is isothermal and relies on the simultaneous action of three enzymes, avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (AMV-RT), T7 RNA polymerase, and RNaseH. The NASBA amplicon is single-stranded RNA complementary to the original RNA target and is produced via a DNA intermediate. Traditionally, detection of the RNA product is by utilising target specific probes in an amplification end-point electrochemilluminescence (ECL) reaction. A large number of NASBA diagnostic assays have been developed that use ECL detection including those for detecting HIV [Keivits et al., 1991] , enteroviruses , noroviruses [Greene et al., 2003; Moore et al., 2004] , and avian strains of influenza [Lau et al., 2004] . Despite being more rapid than traditional RT-PCR, NASBA with ECL detection still requires more hands-on time than realtime PCR techniques [Leone et al., 1998; Ellis and Zambon, 2002; Hibbitts and Fox, 2002] .",

The principles remain the same as those of standard ECL detection, but the main difference is the introduction of a molecular beacon, a hairpin oligonucleotide probe, labeled with a fluorescent reporter dye and a quencher, into the amplification mix. The reporter dye and quencher are brought into close proximity by a self-complementary stem structure preventing the reporter dye from emitting fluorescence. The target specific portion of the beacon, however, hybridises to complementary sequence in the single-stranded NASBA product as it is amplified, thus opening the hairpin structure, removing the reporter dye away from the quencher allowing it to fluoresce at its characteristic wavelength. By labelling molecular beacons with different dyes, it is possible to detect simultaneously more than one target in any given NASBA reaction. This has been applied successfully in a real-time NASBA assay for the detection of enteroviruses with an internal control and in HIV quantitation using an internal standard [Leone et al., 1998; Deiman et al., 2002; Hibbitts and Fox, 2004] .",

Briefly, to the reagent sphere, 80 ml of diluent, 13.5 ml of molecular grade water, 14-16 ml of stock KCl (final concentration 70-80 mM), 5 ml of each of the required primers (5mM stock of each), and 2.5 ml of molecular beacon (final concentration 0.05 mM-0.2 mM) were added (Table I) . Appropriate positive and negative controls were included in each assay. Five microliters of extract or synthetic RNA and 10 ml of the master mix was added to 0.2 ml tubes and incubated on the NucliSens 1 EasyQ (bioM\u00e9rieux Ltd.) incubator for 2 min at 658C and then 2 min at 418C. Enzyme was then added to each tube, mixed and briefly centrifuged. Real-time NASBA was undertaken using the NucliSens 1 Easy Q Analyzer (bioM\u00e9rieux Ltd.) for 90-150 min at 418C.",

During the outbreak investigation, it was noted that 79% (46/58) of the residents had been immunized against influenza during the previous autumn. There was some delay in sampling the patients during the outbreak, as the first cases were not reported immediately to the local consultant in communicable disease control (CCDC) and due to the rural location where the outbreak occurred, there was also some delay in receiving the samples in the laboratory. Consequently, none of the nose and throat swabs taken yielded influenza A in cell culture, probably due to a loss in viral infectivity, as the influenza A strain identified as causing the outbreak readily grows in routine cell lines. It is likely that if traditional laboratory techniques were used alone, the cause of the outbreak would not have been known until the results of the serology became available. By utilizing the real-time NASBA assay, viral RNA could still be detected in the samples and the results were available within 24 hr of sample receipt in the laboratory providing the opportunity for some prophylactic intervention.",

From sequencing studies, the strain of virus causing most infections in the UK was the drifted Fujian strain of H3N2 influenza A. The pattern of disease was typical of that observed for other influenza epidemics [Treanor, 2004] . This included an early start to the season and an increased number of very young children being severely infected due to a lack of prior exposure to other H3N2 viruses. There were significant difficulties in diagnosing the virus effectively using cell culture techniques, as the virus did not grow well, this meant that early infections during the season were probably missed. This feature of the virus is reflected in the data presented for patient group 2 with the low number of influenza isolations seen overall compared to the number of samples found positive by real-time NASBA. As a result a better correlation between cell culture and the real-time NASBA assay may be achieved during a year when a different influenza A virus circulates.",

One sample was, however, found to be negative by NASBA on repeat extraction and testing despite having positive IF and cell culture results. This discrepancy may be due to the presence of an inhibitor in the sample affecting the molecular assays used. Overall, the inhibition rates are not known for each sample type included in the evaluation and the only way to determine this and to ensure that the assay is performing optimally is to develop and include an internal control with each sample extraction and amplification.",

As all were confirmed, a high level of confidence was given to a NASBA positive result. With the absence of an internal control, however, such confidence cannot be afforded to a negative result, although as demonstrated only one positive sample seemed to be missed by the real-time NASBA assay and in patient group 1, a negative result was confirmed by serology giving some degree of confidence. An observation made during the evaluation was how the introduction of sensitive molecular techniques can impact on epidemiological surveillance. For example, during the 2003/2004 season, data from primary care centres in Wales remained well below normal activity for influenza consultations [www.cdsc.wales.nhs.uk, accessed March 17, 2004] . However, during the same period, the laboratory data produced a different picture with more influenza being detected than in the three previous seasons due to the introduction of the NASBA assay. This was particularly important in terms of the National Institute of Clinical Excellence (NICE) treatment guidelines that state that oseltamivir should only be prescribed if there is evidence of influenza circulating in the community.",

However, with the emergence of SARS and avian influenza in the Far East, it has become imperative that rapid, sensitive, and specific techniques are developed to provide a differential diagnosis for common respiratory viruses in the community. For example, the influenza outbreak investigated (patient group 1) occurred during a time when Britain was on high alert for the importation of the SARS virus. By providing a rapid diagnosis using molecular assays such as the real-time NASBA, outbreaks such as this can be investigated quickly helping in part to allay any fears regarding more sinister causative agents. In addition, there is the potential of taking a nose or throat swab and putting it directly in lysis buffer. In this way, the sample can be more safely transported to the laboratory for testing, as any virus present will be rendered non-infectious.",

The disadvantage of this approach is that sub-typing the detected virus is impossible and further techniques, such as sequencing of the HA and NA genes, are needed to confirm the strain. NASBA also has its limitations in that the products of amplification cannot be sequenced further to detect mutations that might give rise to antiviral resistance. However, by being able to detect such a broad range of influenza A strains in a single assay is extremely useful in screening large numbers of clinical samples in a routine diagnostic setting.",
