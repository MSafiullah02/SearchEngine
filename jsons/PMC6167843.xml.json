Mortality rates in children younger than 5 years have dropped from 11.9 million deaths in 1990 to 7.7 million deaths in 2010 [2]. Worldwide, the distribution of deaths in children fewer than five years of age is 33% in south Asia, 50% in sub-Saharan Africa, and less than 1% in high-income countries [3]. Common factors associated with childhood mortality include acute trauma, extremely preterm birth, and late presentation to the emergency units [4]. In resource-poor countries, pneumonia and diarrhea account for 20% of deaths in children fewer than 5 years old [2]. Malaria, AIDS, acute respiratory-tract infection, measles, and malnutrition were significantly contributed to child mortality [5]. In developing countries 10 to 20% of severely sick children are admitted to hospital every year [6\u20138].",

In pediatric departments, early child mortality is commonly caused by preventable and reversible diseases, so urgent treatment and resuscitation are required to avoid poor outcomes [12, 13]. Early identification and treatment of pneumonia, sepsis, malaria, heart failure (secondary to anemia), acute respiratory tract infections, and diarrheal diseases has been shown to reduce childhood mortality in acute pediatric hospitals [14\u201317]. Effective intervention and good emergency care of children requires effort and coordination starting from the bedside up to the governmental level. Critical clinical issues, such as shortness of breath, fast breathing and fever with seizure are some of the preventable causes contributing to childhood mortality [12]. Despite advances in public health systems in Ethiopia through global partnerships, there is still a lack of well-organized pediatric emergency units. There is also limited information regarding pediatric mortality patterns, causes and associated factors [18].",

In Ethiopia, pneumonia is an important public health problem for all children, and creates a significant burden of childhood mortality [18, 35]. A health extension program package focused on disease prevention and health education targeting antibiotic treatment for childhood pneumonia might be a solution to decrease deaths from pneumonia. However, there are some challenges in promoting a health extension program package due to knowledge gaps of health extension workers such as misdiagnosis, negligence and inappropriate referrals [36, 37]. These problems need to be addressed and improved because pneumonia contributes to the high early pediatric mortality in developing countries [38].",

A delay in presentation of more than 48 h, diarrheal diseases and shortness of breath were significantly associated with early pediatric mortality. Almost all mortality was due to preventable diseases, which can be controlled with minimum resources and quality care provision. We were unable to extract data for a significant proportion of patients due to limitations of and/or missing medical documentation.
