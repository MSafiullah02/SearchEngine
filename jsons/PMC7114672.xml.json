It emerged in late 2002 and was transmitted in a similar way to the cold virus [2]. Having started in the Guandong province of China, the disease was transmitted with great rapidity to Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Hong Kong, South Africa, Spain and the USA. This lead to serious public health concerns. The SARS outbreak peaked during the second quarter of 2003 and was declared over by July 2003. Although approximately 10,000 individuals were infected, of which 10% died, the overall impact on health was far less devastating than initially feared.",

During the outbreak, there was a noticeable downturn in travel and tourism income for many infected countries. It was also anticipated that fear of disease would impact those industries which gather people in public places such as restaurants, cinemas and retail establishments [3].",

For some Asian countries the possibility of economic effect in the first quarter has also been permitted since those countries also had SARS cases in the first quarter of 2003. Seasonality in monthly and quarterly data was taken into account and, where possible, each data item was compared with the corresponding data item of the previous and/or succeeding year.

For annual figures, data from the surrounding years was used to estimate 2003 data in the absence of SARS, using the previous and successive year's average where possible, but also taking into account any trend in neighbouring data.

For instance the avoidance of public places by natives together with the avoidance of a certain country by tourists will mainly impact the retail, tourism and entertainment related sectors.

The third quarter figure is also slightly low possibly indicating the end of the decline. It is reasonable to attribute the sharp decline, which is of the order of HK$ 2000 million = US$ 0.26 billion, to the SARS outbreak as the most obvious major potential effect on Hong Kong's economy for such a short period.",

It is also possible that, since the WHO took an active role in the SARS outbreak using its Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN), the intervention by WHO and the input from this globalised network may have contributed to a reduction in the progression of the disease. However, for those countries, such as China and Hong Kong, where SARS became a real threat with a significant death toll, there were indeed some large short-term losses. However, these losses correspond only to the relatively short period of the disease outbreak, after which consumer confidence returned and many stocks that had diminished were replenished and some purchases which were forgone at the height of the outbreak were made after the perceived risk was reduced. This conjecture is supported by the rapid return to normality (bounce-back) exhibited in many cases. Indeed, some of the predictive economic models [4] considered two scenarios of SARS lasting one quarter or two quarters, which may explain the over-estimation of effect in some cases. In reality, for many countries the time from first to last probable case was barely one month. These assumptions were reasonable at the time of the outbreak but the true impact did not reach the heights of some model predictions.",

For instance, the very obvious economic repercussions from the outbreak provide a frame of reference for the value of investment in policies and interventions designed to address the emergence and transmission of an outbreak. This could be then used to indicate the value to be placed on transparency by governments and early notification of an outbreak which may be used as a case for increased investment in surveillance or cross-national compensatory transfers of funds to support those countries with an outbreak in the notification of it. In addition, this work demonstrates that the economic impact is determined largely by the desire of people to reduce their public interaction (travel, leisure, tourism), which indicates the importance of portraying a correct understanding of the risk posed by the outbreak to the population. In this respect, it is interesting to reflect upon the possible role of the media in exacerbating or dampening the impact of SARS upon economic activity. It has been concluded elsewhere that \u201cthe general consensus is that the media coverage of SARS was excessive, sometimes inaccurate, and sensationalist\u201d [3, p. 3117]. However, the role of the media in the communication of risk, and how this is interpreted and acted upon, remains an area for debate, and certainly attempting to quantify the impact of media portrayal of the outbreak in economic terms is beyond this paper and has not been undertaken elsewhere. Of more general importance for the impact of future outbreaks, and the policy response to them, might be the impact that exaggerated media reporting of a number of such outbreaks may generate either a more general climate of \u2018fear\u2019, and thus exacerbating the response to each individual outbreak, or desensitizing the public to the effects of such outbreaks, if the reality consistently falls short of the rhetoric [3]. Clearly the role of media, and more general communication, concerning outbreaks requires further research.",

Border screening is also an unnecessary cost since it only detects those who are at certain stage of disease progression from entering a country [12]. Whilst these measures may be used to inspire public confidence and political assurances that appropriate action is being taken, alternatives such as vaccines, antivirals or advanced funds for use in such situations, as outlined elsewhere [14], might provide a more cost-effective return.",
