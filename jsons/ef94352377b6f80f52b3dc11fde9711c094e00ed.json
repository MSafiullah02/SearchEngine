            "text": "Epigenetic analysis leads to identification of HNF1B as a subtype-specific susceptibility gene for ovarian cancer Hui Shen, Brooke L. Fridley, Honglin Song et al. w HNF1B is overexpressed in clear cell epithelial ovarian cancer, and we observed epigenetic silencing in serous epithelial ovarian cancer, leading us to hypothesize that variation in this gene differentially associates with epithelial ovarian cancer risk according to histological subtype. Here we comprehensively map variation in HNF1B with respect to epithelial ovarian cancer risk and analyse DNA methylation and expression profiles across histological subtypes. Different single-nucleotide polymorphisms associate with invasive serous (rs7405776 odds ratio (OR) \u00bc 1.13, P \u00bc 3.1 \u00c2 10 \u00c0 10 ) and clear cell (rs11651755 OR \u00bc 0.77, P \u00bc 1.6 \u00c2 10 \u00c0 8 ) epithelial ovarian cancer. Risk alleles for the serous subtype associate with higher HNF1B-promoter methylation in these tumours. Unmethylated, expressed HNF1B, primarily present in clear cell tumours, coincides with a CpG island methylator phenotype affecting numerous other promoters throughout the genome. Different variants in HNF1B associate with risk of serous and clear cell epithelial ovarian cancer; DNA methylation and expression patterns are also notably distinct between these subtypes. These findings underscore distinct mechanisms driving different epithelial ovarian cancer histological subtypes.",

            "text": "Discussion HNF1B appears to have a prominent role in ovarian cancer aetiology. It is the first clear cell ovarian cancer-susceptibility gene identified, and variation in the gene is also associated with risk of serous ovarian cancer at a genome-wide significance level. The gene is overexpressed in clear cell tumours and silenced in serous tumours. The strong association between HNF1B expression and CIMP methylation (P \u00bc 3 \u00c2 10 \u00c0 16 ), and the reciprocal nature of DNA methylation at the HNF1B-promoter CpG islands, versus other CpG islands across the genome, suggests that HNF1B-promoter methylation is not merely a CIMP passenger event; in fact, HNF1B expression may even contribute to the hypermethylation phenotype. Taken together, these data indicate differing roles for HNF1B in these invasive EOC c Figure 1 | Identification of HNF1B as a subtype-specific candidate gene for ovarian cancer and its establishment as a susceptibility gene. (a) The scatterplot compares the mRNA expression (y axis) versus DNA methylation (x axis) in serous ovarian tumours from TCGA (see Methods). Each blue dot is a serous tumour sample, whereas each pink dot is one of the ten normal fallopian tube samples. The HNF1B promoter is silenced in the majority of these tumours, either by an epigenetic (bottom right, high DNA methylation and low mRNA expression) or an unknown alternative mechanism. The mRNA expression data were integrated from three platforms (online Methods) and interpreted as log ratios, and we observe the same pattern with each individual expression platform ( These different effects provide further support for the growing view that the histological subtypes of ovarian cancer represent distinct diseases [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] , with endometriosis as a proposed cell of origin for clear cell disease 18 and fallopian tube fimbriae as one for serous disease 22 . Interestingly, no association was observed between HNF1B genotypes and endometrioid ovarian cancer despite the view that, like clear cell, endometriosis is also a cell of origin for this subtype. The lack of association may be due to a different transformation mechanism from endometriosis for the endometrioid subtype, given that although the HNF1B promoter remains unmethylated in the endometrioid subtype, the endometrioid subtype does not overexpress HNF1B. Alternatively, misclassification of high-grade serous EOC as high-grade endometrioid could result in a bias towards the null for the endometrioid subtype.",

The opposing directions of these associations mirror the differential effects seen here in ovarian cancer. The most strongly associated SNP for both prostate 14 and uterine cancer 17 is rs4430796, correlated at r 2 \u00bc 0.94 with the top clear cell ovarian cancer SNP, rs11651755, suggesting a common risk variant. Although increased risk of type II diabetes has been reported with rs4430796 (ref. 12), Winckler et al. 13 have suggested that the best marker of diabetes risk is rs757210, which correlated at r 2 \u00bc 0.97 with our top serous SNP.

            "text": "We were able to completely fine-map the HNF1B region, localize the signal and identify a handful of potentially causal SNPs. This is quite different from other regions of the genome where it is not uncommon to identify hundreds of candidate causal SNPs. Further, an important link, often missing when susceptibility loci are identified, is the functional role that the variant has in disease. In the case of serous ovarian cancer, the SNP-HNF1B-promoter DNA methylation association strengthens as it approaches the promoter region, particularly where it overlaps with a PRC2 mark. PRC2- DNA methyltransferase cross-talk has been proposed to be a mechanism of predisposition to cancer-specific hypermethylation 25 . Our DNA-methylation data indicate that the causal risk alleles for the serous subtype may predispose the promoter to acquiring aberrant methylation, thereby promoting the development of serous but not clear cell tumours. This predisposition could be a direct functional effect of the SNP on the DNA-methylation machinery, or could act indirectly through differential binding affinity for PRC2 or one or more transcription factors. Given that we were able to fine-map the HNF1B region, it is unlikely that an unidentified common variant explains these associations. For serous ovarian cancer, the methylation signal suggests that the causal variant is most likely to be among those located within the region with the PRC2 mark for which we identified five SNPs with genome-wide significance. This is the first study investigating the effects of overexpression of HNF1B in endometriosis, and the results support the hypothesis that HNF1B may have an oncogenic role in the initiation of clear cell ovarian cancers, as speculated by Gounaris et al. 23 as a key step of endometriosis transformation. The observation in our data that HNF1B induces a polynucleated phenotype in EEC cells is intriguing, as clear cell ovarian cancers are often tetradiploid, more so than other ovarian cancer subtypes 26 . The polynucleated phenotype may suggest that HNF1B overexpression in EECs perturbs cytokinesis, causing aneuploidy in some cells.",

We assessed the correlation of germline genotype at the nine genome-wide significant SNPs in serous cancer, with HNF1B DNA promoter methylation status using the Mayo Tumour Panel. Probe cg14487292 was used as it was most inversely correlated with mRNA expression. The nominal P-values are from two-sided tests for linear trend in the DNA-methylation beta values across the three genotypes for each locus. Bonferroni adjustment was not done for multiple comparisons as the SNPs are highly correlated. Validation was done with the TCGA data (Supplementary Appendix).",

The genetic susceptibility aspect of this study was organized by the Collaborative Oncological Gene-Environment Study, an ovarian, breast and prostate cancer consortium. The ovarian cancer part of this effort on which the current report is based is led by the Ovarian Cancer Association Consortium and included 43 studies (Supplementary Table S1 ). Following sample quality control, 44,308 subjects, including 16,111 patients with invasive EOC, 2,063 with low malignant potential (borderline) disease and 26,134 controls, were available for analysis; results presented here are restricted to invasive cancers. All studies obtained approval from their respective human research ethics committees, and all participants provided written informed consent. For LAMP-derived European ancestry groups for all patients of invasive cancer and for those with serous invasive cancer, we carried out unconditional logistic regression analyses within each study site, adjusted for the first five eigenvalues from the principal components analysis for European ancestry and then used a fixed-effects meta-analytic approach to obtain the summary OR estimate, 95% confidence interval and P-value. Details on analysis for the non-European groups are provided in the Supplementary Methods. Log-additive mode of inheritance was modelled (that is, co-dominant), treating each SNP as an ordinal variable. For haplotype analysis, we used the tagSNPs program 31 to obtain the haplotype dosage for each subject for the LAMP-derived European ancestry group for haplotypes with a frequency of Z1%. The associations between haplotype and risks of serous and clear cell ovarian cancer were modelled by meta-analysis relative to the most common haplotype.",

These data are consistent with reported HNF1B expression in the clear cell tumours. (c) Genetic variants in the HNF1B locus are associated with risk of ovarian cancer histological subtypes. Plotted in each panel is the \u00c0 log10 (P-value) from the SNP association with risk for each subtype (Manhattan plots) located in the 150-kb region described in the text. Imputed SNPs are indicated with a relatively lighter colour, whereas the genotyped SNPs are indicated with a darker colour.

We also performed the Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip assay on an independent set of tumour DNA in the Mayo Clinic Genotyping Shared Facility using recommended Illumina protocol 29 . 1 mg of tumour DNA was bisulfiteconverted using the Zymo EZ96 DNA Methylation Kit. Three samples failing quality control were removed, leaving DNA-methylation data on 333 ovarian cancer cases, including 254 serous and 17 clear cell tumours. Plate normalization was done with a linear model on the logit-transformed beta values, following backtransformation to the (0,1) range.",
