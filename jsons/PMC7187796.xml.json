            "text": "Concern over airborne dissemination of viral particles such as the coronavirus, influenza virus and bioterrorism agents as well as the growing use of engineered nanoparticles have increased the need for additional environmental sampling techniques, especially for the nano-scale particle size range. Nano-scale particles have sizes <100 nm (Oberd\u00f6rster et al., 2005). Viruses range in size from 20 to 200 nm and can be found in droplet nuclei or attached to other airborne particles (Reponen et al., 2001). Viruses in the Orthomyxoviridae family include those associated with influenza such as the Avian flu virus and range in size from 80 to 120 nm (Mandell et al., 2005). It is estimated that globally \u223c5% of all adults and 20% of all children develop symptomatic influenza infections each year (Nicholson et al., 2003). It is a costly disease that results in much human suffering as well as economic impact in terms of lost time and medical expenses. Viruses in the Coronaviridae family, which includes the virus linked to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), range in size from 80 to 150 nm (Mandell et al., 2005). There is also much interest in developing environmental sampling techniques for bioterrorism agents including bacterial agents such as Bacillus anthracis (anthrax), Yersinia pestis (plague) and Francisella tularensis (tularemia), and viral agents including variola major (smallpox) and filoviruses and arenaviruses (viral hemorrhagic fevers), some of which are found in the smaller particle ranges (CDC, 2006).",

One limiting factor for traditional bioaerosol sampling has been the use of culturable count as a measure of exposure. The development of real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (Q-PCR) techniques, which do not depend on culturability, allows for the detection of microorganisms of interest with a short analysis time. This has led to the possibility of conducting longer term air sampling and the evaluation of individual exposures using personal breathing zone filter sampling instead of estimates based on short-term area monitoring.",

They found that the gelatin filters had a collection efficiency of greater than 99.95% for particles between 0.5 and 3.0 \u03bcm in size. Jaschhof used the gelatin filter to collect laboratory-generated T1 phage and influenza A virus particles (Jaschhof, 1992).

Utilizing a reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT\u2013PCR), they were able to detect virus on the filter with a sampling time of 40 h. Booth et al. (2005) examined several different monitoring techniques to determine if SARS coronavirus could be detected in environmental samples collected in Toronto hospitals. Using a slit sampler and a PCR technique, the investigators obtained two positive air samples from a room with a recovering SARS patient. Wet swab sampling yielded positive results for commonly touched surfaces, including a bed-side table, remote control, and medication refrigerator door. At the same time, traditional air sampling with PTFE filters did not yield any results above the detection limit. It should be noted that no information was provided about extraction techniques while extraction has been shown to affect the filter sample data in a major way (Booth et al., 2005, Burton et al., 2005). Tseng and Li (2005a) investigated the collection efficiency in terms of viability for four different bacteriophages with four different samplers. They found that gelatin filter samplers, Andersen impactor samplers, and impingers were more suitable for the collection of viral particles than the sampler equipped with nucleopore (membrane) filters. Alternative sampling methodologies have also been developed, e.g. a new personal bioaerosol sampler that allows collecting bioaerosol particles through porous media immersed in a collection fluid (Agranovski et al., 2004 a,b). The collection fluid can then be used in various analyses.",

This is a bacteriophage that infects only male Escherichia coli bacteria (Fiers 1967; Valegard et al., 1990; Golmohammadi et al., 1993). The small size and simple structure of MS2 virions, their single-stranded RNA genome, as well as harmlessness to humans, animals, plants and other higher organisms have made MS2 particularly useful in simulating RNA viruses such as Ebola, Marburg and the equine encephalitis alphaviruses (O'Connell et al., 2006). In addition, MS2 bacteriophages have previously been used a surrogate for poliovirus and many other enteric viruses due to similarity of their characteristics. Several investigators utilized MS2 as a simulant of pathogenic viral strains (Belgrader et al., 1998; Alvarez et al., 2000; Shin and Sobsey, 2003; Thomas et al., 2004; Tseng and Li, 2005b). The MS2 bacteriophage stock solution was prepared from a freeze-dried phage stock vial (ATCC 15597-B1) by adding 9 ml of Luria\u2013Bertani broth, which had been made using ultra-filtered deionized water. The resulting suspension was serially diluted and the final suspension resulted in 108 to 109 plaque-forming units of MS2 per milliliter of solution.",

One-tenth of a milliliter of re-constituted PSL particles were mixed with 50 ml of sterilized, deionized water to create stock solutions In order to determine a typical concentration and particle size distribution in indoor air to use for the loading experiment, aerosol measurements were carried out for 23 h with the OPC in a home that was part of a larger indoor air quality study (Lee et al., 2006a). Then, three separate PSL test mixtures were created using aliquots of 0.35, 0.54, 0.69, 0.61, 1.08, 2.43 and 5.05-\u03bcm stock solutions. The comparison of the particle size distributions of the field-measured indoor aerosol and the laboratory-generated PSL mixtures (with fractions from 0.35 to 5.05 \u03bcm) is presented in Fig. 2 as a numeric percentage. This figure shows that the field-measured levels can be reproduced in the laboratory using a mixture of monodisperse PSL particles of different sizes. The second PSL test solution showed a higher percentage of 0.5-\u03bcm particles which may be a result of incomplete mixing or clumping in the Collison nebulizer.",

The low Epce for the PC filters also agrees with the reported performance of PC filters since the 1980s. Hinds and Liu and associates reported that minimum filter efficiencies for membrane filters were at \u223c50 nm, which agrees with the data shown in Fig. 3 (Hinds 1999; Liu, 1983).

The collection efficiencies obtained for the pre- and post-loading for both particle types are very similar to those presented in Fig. 3. Similar to Epce, the Epce-loaded was higher for the 0.35-\u03bcm PSL particles (>90%) than for the MS2 particles (>67%) when tested with 1-\u03bcm pore size PC filters. The 0.3-\u03bcm pore size PTFE filters exhibited high Epces-loaded (>99%) with both challenge aerosols. The 3-\u03bcm pore size PTFE filters showed Epce-loaded of >99% for the 0.35 \u03bcm PSL particles and >96% for the MS2. The PTFE filters had much higher Epce-loaded for the MS2 particles than the 1-\u03bcm pore size PC which is consistent with the data collected for unloaded filters. The small increase in Epce-loaded that was observed for the majority of the filters was anticipated. Paired t-tests, however, showed that the collection efficiencies for loaded and unloaded filters were not statistically significantly different.",

The 0.3-\u03bcm PTFE filter used with the 37-mm three-piece cassette exhibited the lowest pressure drop and highest physical collection efficiency for B.atrophaeus and MS2 particles. The other PTFE filters also showed very good physical collection efficiencies across the size range of 10\u2013900 nm with relatively low pressure drop. PTFE filters were found to have good recovery of aerosolized bacteria when used in button samplers (Burton et al., 2005). Additional work, however, needs to be conducted to investigate the recovery efficiency for smaller particles from the PTFE filters. The tested gelatin filter also had good physical collection efficiency, but may not be suitable for long-term sampling due to potential drying out (Burton et al., 2005, Tseng and Li, 2005a). The PC filters made of a thin layer of material appear to have little internal capture capability when compared to the fibrous membrane filters in the nano-scale particle size range. At the same time, the PC filters exhibited acceptable Epce with the B.atrophaeus bacteria (the largest aerosol particles tested in this study). The findings suggest that the PTFE filters are the best option among the tested ones for long-term personal sampling of nano-scale particles and virions in terms of collection efficiency. Several of the tested filters were found to be equally appropriate for the collection of bacteria including the 1-\u03bcm PC, 0.3-\u03bcm PTFE and 3-\u03bcm PTFE filters.",
