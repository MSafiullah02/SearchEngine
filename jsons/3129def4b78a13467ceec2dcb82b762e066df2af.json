Thirty-seven outbreaks attributed to recreational water exposure from 17 states affected an estimated 9 l29 persons, including 8 449 persons in two large outbreaks of cryptosporidiosis. Twentytwo of these 37 were outbreaks of gastroenteritis, 9 were outbreaks of dermatitis, and 6 were single cases of primary amebic meningoencephalitis caused by Naegleria fowleri, all of which were fatal. The etiologic agent was identified for 33 of the 37 outbreaks. Six of the 22 outbreaks of gastroenteritis were caused by Cryptosporidium parvum and 6 by E. coli 0l57:H7. All of the latter were associated with unchlorinated water (i.e., in lakes) or inadequately chlorinated water (i.e., in a pool). Thirteen of these 22 outbreaks were associated with lake water, eight (36.4%) with swimming or wading pools, and one (4.5%) with a hot spring. Of the nine outbreaks of dermatitis, seven were outbreaks of Pseudomonas dermatitis associated with hot tubs, and two were lake-associated outbreaks of swimmer's itch caused by Schistosoma sp. WBDOs caused by E. coLi 0157:H7 were reported more frequently than in previous years and were associated primarily with recreational lake water. Tillett et a!. (l998) developed a method of categorizing the evidence used to implicate water in disease outbreaks. The scheme takes into account epidemiology, microbiology, and water quality information.",

In these methods, the microorganism is grown on either a solid (agar) or liquid (broth) medium, which supplies the nutritional requirements of the organism, or in the case of obligate parasites such as viruses, the organism is grown in a culture of host cells. Once a microorganism has been grown and isolated as a pure culture, identification of the organism is based on biochemical, immunological (serological), and genetic characteristics of the isolate. In many instances, particularly for such wellstudied organisms as the coliforms, specific compounds are incorporated into the primary media, which allow for selection and differentiation of the organisms of interest. For example, Endo agar is routinely used for the enumeration of coliforms and other enteric organisms. This agar has sodium sulfite and basic fuchsin to inhibit the growth of Gram-positive bacteria. In addition, lactose is present as a primary substrate for bacterial nutrition. Metabolism of lactose with the formation of acid and gas, a hallmark characteristic of the coliform group, is detected by a color change due to the reaction between acetaldehyde (an intermediate product of lactose fermentation) and the sodium sulfite.",

When mixed with a solution of DNA extracted from an environmental sample, the probe will only bind to those specific target sequences that are complementary to it. Thus, the presence of specific microbial nucleic acid, and presumably then specific microorganisms, can be determined. Frequently, the amount of specific nucleic acid:; present in environmental samples are too low to be detected directly by gene probes. In this case, there is a need to increase, or amplify, the specific sequences to detectable levels. This is accomplished through the use of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR).",

Counts by mTEC were consistently higher than mFC counts at all salinity ranges. In addition, a significant number of false positives were associated with using mFC in middle and high salinity areas. Lifshitz and Joshi (1998) found the Coli Plate (CP) kit gave estimates of E. coli that were 20% higher than standard membrane filtration when the two methods were compared for testing water samples. The difference increased when samples were spiked with injured cells. They concluded that the CP kit is a more reliable method for use with samples having high levels of injured or weakened cells. m-ColiBlue24 (m-CB) was compared to m-Endo medium and an International Organization for Standardization (ISO) standard coliform medium, lactose agar with Tergitol 7, for the analysis of indicator organisms in bottled water (Grant, 1998) . Coliform :malysis was conducted on 104 brands of bottled water from 10 countries. Presumptive coliform colonies were found in 5.8% of the samples with m-CB, 1.9% with m-Endo, and 11.5% with lactose agar with Tergitol 7.

Eckner (1998) reported on a comparison of the Colilert system to the Swedish standard methods using multipletube fermt:ntatlon or membrane filtration on 338 water samples. The Colilert system was found to be more sensitive than Swedish standard methods for detecting coliform bacteria and of equal sensitivity for detecting Escherichia coli, Landre et al. (1998) reported that Aeromonas sp. at low concentrations can yield a false positive reaction using Colilert reagent 4 weeks short of shelf-life expiration. They caution against the use of aged Colilert for monitoring water quality because it could lead to an overestimation of coliforms. f3-Galactosidase activity of E. coli after chlorination was less reduced than CFUs, indicating that detection and enumeration methods based on this enzyme may be more sensitive to injured cells . Because bacteria other than coliforms can produce f3-galactosidease and f3-glucuronidase, the possibility exists that defined substrate tests may give false positive results. examined this possibility by measuring the activity of these two enzymes in noncoliform water isolates. In all cases, enzyme activity in the noncoliforms was significantly less than in the coliforms, leading the authors to conclude that noncoliform bacteria must be present in significantly higher concentrations than coliforms to interfere with the enzymatic detection of these organisms. Alonso et al. (1998) compared a new chromogenic medium, Chromocult Coliform (CC) agar, to mFC medium. There were no statistically significant differences between the two media. Specificity of CC agar was found to be related to incubation temperature and the authors recommended lowering the incubation temperature from 44.5 to 41\u00b0C",

During the 60-day study, the number of total cells stained with a fluorescent dye or counted with a Coulter Counter remained constant, while the number of ce~ls capable of forming colonies on Tryptic Soy Agar (TSA) declined rapidly. On day 14, no colonies could be observed when 50 mL of inoculated lake water were plated; however, the cells showed active uptake of amino acids and E. faecalis specific DNA was detected by PCR throughout the experiment. The data obtained in this study lend further support to recent criticisms of the traditional methods used to evaluate water quality based on plate counts. Bogosian et al. (1998) recently questioned the entire concept of a VNC state. Using a new method (mixed culture recovery method), they examined strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Salmonella choleraesuis. Results indicate that nonculturable cells are dead and that apparent resuscitation of cells resulted from growth of a few remaining viable cells in the culture.",

The new MF medium, mEl medium, detected levels of enterococci in 24 hours comparable to those detected by the original mE medium in 48 hours, with the same level of statistical confidence. In addition, the use of mEl medium eliminated the need to transfer the membrane to a substrate medium to differentiate enterococci from other genera of the fecal streptococcal group. mEl medium had a false-positive rate of 6.0% and a false-negative rate of 6.5%. Heiber et a!.

A total of 297 waste samples from different stages of water treatment and distribution as well as from individual water supplies were evaluated. Identification of enterococci species by DNA hybridization with recently designed oligonucleotide probes was 532 superior to results obtained with a common biochemical test panel (Frahm et aI., 1998) . Using these findings, a procedure for the detection of enterococci in water samples was developed, consisting of a short enrichment followed by an amplification step and a hybridization reaction in microtiter plate format. The detection limit was 1 CFU/mL, and results were available within 26 hours.",

(1998) evaluated the antibiotic susceptibility of 54 isolates of yellow-pigmented enterococci to determine if antibiotic resistance patterns could be used as a specific indicator of human and nonhuman sources of fecal contamination of water. Their results suggested that vancomycin-susceptability testing may have value in the identification of sources of pollution because there was a significantly higher resistance to vancomycin in isolates from wild sources compared with that from other sources. The ability of Enterococcus faecalis to transfer various genetic elements under natural conditions was tested in two municipal sewage water treatment plants (Marcinek et aI., 1998) . The transfer rate between different strains of E. faecalis under natural conditions was, compared to that under laboratory conditions, significantly lower, indicating that gene transfer should not take place under natural conditions. Sartory et al. (1998a) evaluated two media (mCP medium and Tryptose Sulphite Cycloserine [TSC] agar) for recovery of Clostridium perfringens in environmental and partially treated drinking water. TSC recovered significantly greater numbers of Cl. perfringens than mCP. There was a significant number of false presumptive positive and negative isolates on mCP. Therefore, the authors concluded that TSC is a more suitable medium for the routine monitoring of water supplies for the presence of Cl. perfringens. Edwards et a!. (1998) examined the distribution of Cl. perfringens in sediment cores near an untreated wastewater outfall at Mc-Murdo Station, Antarctica. Clostridium perfringens decreased with depth in the sediment and with distance from the outfall.",

(1998) evaluated the usefulness of total coliforms, fecal coliforms, and fecal streptococci in predicting the presence of Salmonella spp., Staphylococcus aureus, and Candida albicans in sewage polluted coastal water. Total coliforms gave a better correlation with the presence of Salmonella spp. and Staph. au reus than either of the two fecal groups of organisms. Fecal coliforms were better predictors of the presence of Candida alb icans in moderately polluted areas. The authors concluded that monitoring of total coliforms, without the measurement of fecal coliforms or fecal streptococci is adequate in moderately contaminated coastal waters. Nola et a!. (1998) conducted a microbiologica] survey of 5 spring water points and ]0 wells located in various residential districts and selected according to geographical location and number of users in Yaounde, Cameroon. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Aeromonas hydrophila, and indicators of fecal contamination were frequently found in the water samples. The density of fecal bacteria was strongly correlated with P. aeruginosa in spring water and with A. hydrophila in well water. Pianetti et al. (1998) evaluated the usefulness of traditional indicator organisms in predicting the presence of Salmonella, Campylobacter, Aeromonas, and Yersinia spp. in river water. In 168 water samples analyzed, 22.6% were positive for Salmonella, 30.9% were positive for Campylobacter, 23.2% were positive for Aeromonas, and 4.7% were positive for Yersinia. No correlation between indicator organisms and these potential pathogens were found, indicating that routine monitoring of river water for indicator organisms may not be protective of public health. Pruss (I998) reviewed studies on uncontrolled waters, such as seas, lakes, and rivers, to evaluate the health risks caused by poor microbiological quality of recreational water. Most studies reported a dose-related increase of health risk in swimmers with an increase in the indicator bacteria count in recreational waters. The indicator microorganisms that correlated best with health outcomes were enterococci/fecal streptococci for both marine and freshwater and E. coli for freshwater. European Union (E.U.) bathing water standards set a guide level for thermotolerant coliforms of 100/100 mL and an imperative level of 2 000/100 mL. Van Asperen et al. evaluated these standards in a study of the risk of gastroenteritis among triathletes. Swimming in freshwaters that failed the guide level but still met the imperative level was associated with a significant risk of gastroenteritis, indicating that the imperative level may not be protective of public health. Fleisher et al. (1998) found that bathers were at increased risk .of gastroenteritis, acute respiratory illness, and ear and eye infections compared to non bathers even at beaches meeting both the U.S. EPA and E.U. criteria for recreational waters. Elliott (1998) proposed a method for combining the temporal concentration frequency distribution of indicator organisms in recreational water with a concentration response relation to obtain the averaged illness rate. Using this method, spatial contours of averaged illness rate could be determined allowing for a more precise assessment of the risk of recreational use of these waters.",

In addition, coliform die-off was studied using membrane dialysis bags containing coli forms and suspended at different depths. Die-off at I meter below the surface was significantly higher than at 10 and 20 meters below the surface, indicating that light was the most important factor in die-off. No correlations between coliform numbers and temperature, oxygen, pH, conductivity, or transparency were found in a study of the bacteriological quality of a shallow lake in the lower Salado River Basin, Argentina (Emiliani and Gonzalez de Paira, 1998) . The main contributor of coli forms to the lake water was shown to be floating vegetation and aquatic macrophytes, particu]arly during high water periods. Calvo et al.

Shellfish (mussels and clams) and shellfish-growing waters were examined for indicator bacteria according to the EC regulations, Salmonella spp., coli phages and anti-Salmonella phages (Legnani et a!., 1998a) . Samples from both natural-growing areas along the coast and from authorized shellfish-harvesting beds were contaminated by coli phages at a significantly higher level than the corresponding bacterial indicators for fecal contamination. Coliphage concentrations were significantly correlated with faecal indicators in marine waters and sediments, but no correlation was found in shellfish, thus showing their low specificity as indicators of fecal pollution of human origin in shellfish of economic importance.",

            "text": "E. coli 0157:H7. E. coli 0157:H7 is an enterohaemorrhagic strain of E. coli. The organism produces a toxin known as vero-534 cytotoxin which is similar to the toxin produced by Shigella. Infection with this organism is associated with haemorrhagic colitis. In a small proportion of the cases, particularly in children, the infection can progress to haemolytic uraemic syndrome, a lifethreatening disease. Risk factors associated with E. coli 0l57:H7 infection were identified in a study at 10 medical centers throughout the U.S. (Slutsker et a!., 1998) . Univariate analysis indicated that drinking unchlorinated well water or swimming in a pond, in addition to the typical food-associated factors (e.g., ingestion of undercooked hamburger) were significantly associated with infection. In an epidemiological study of sporadic E. coli 0157:H7 infections in Scotland, Coia et al. (1998) found that a high proportion of confirmed cases were associated with exposure to farm animals or their byproducts, gardening, or suspected or confirmed household water supply problems before the onset of illness. Samples from cattle, other domestic and wild animals, flies, feeds, and water troughs were collected from 12 cattle farms and tested for E. coli 0157:H7 (Hancock et aI., 1998) . E. coli 0157:H7 was isolated from 10 of 320 water trough sample sets (biofilm and water). The bovine and water trough isolates from two farms showed a high degree of genetic similarity, indicating that water troughs may serve as a reservoir for this organism. A 14-month longitudinal study was conducted on four dairy farms in Wisconsin to ascertain the source(s) and dissemination of E. coli 0157:H7 (Shere et aI., 1998) . E. coli 0157:H7 was isolated from cattle, feed, flies, a pigeon, and water associated with heifers on two farms. When present in animal drinking water, E. coli 0157:H7 was disseminated through the cattle that used the water source. E. coli 0l57:H7 was found in water at < 1 to 23 CFU/mL. Genetic analysis demonstrated that a single strain comprised a majority of the positive samples on the fanns. Wang and Doyle (1998) studied the survival of E. coli 0l57:H7 in filtered and autoclaved municipal water, in reservoir water, and in water from two recreational lakes for a period of 91 days at 8, 15, or 25\u00b0C. Greatest survival was in filtered autoclaved municipal water and least in lake water. Regardless of the water source, survival was greatest at 8 and least at 25\u00b0C. These studies indicate that E. coli 0157:H7 is a hardy pathogen that can survive for long periods of time in water, especially at cold temperatures. In addition, the results suggested that E. coli 0157:H7 can enter a VNC state in water. Warbum et al. (1998) found that E. coli 0157:H7 could survive for up to 300 days when inoculated into bottled water. Scanning electron microscopy of the bottles indicated that the cells attached to and multiplied on the container walls.",

An outbreak of gasteroenteritis due to S. ohio whose origin was the consumption of water from a drinking fountain was described for the first time by Molinero et al. (1998) .

Faruque et al. (1998) reviewed the epidemiology, genetics, and ecology of toxigenic V. cholerae. They emphasized the close association among V. cholera, surface water, and the population interacting with the water. They also noted that molecular epidemiological studies have revealed significant clonal diversity among toxigenic strains and continual emergence of new epidemic clones. Borroto (1998) noted an inverse relationship between toxigenic V. cholerae 01' s ability to survive and the altitude above sea level of freshwater lakes where the organism is introduced. He suggested that this geographic pattern could be used as a basis for the design of a Literature Review 1999 Measurement and Monitoring of Pollutants sampling and monitoring program for the organism in Latin America, where cholera is becoming endemic. Uchiyama (1998a) assessed the persistence of V. cholerae non-Ol in water during the cold season. The results suggested that V. cholerae non-O I would be able to exist in river sediment during the cold season. Colaco et al. (1998) isolated V. cholera 01 strain El Tor biotype in 86% of 2585 water and sewage samples analyzed indicating that fecal contamination of water is the most common source for rapid spread of the organism. In contrast, only 2.1 % of 91 food samples examined by the same researchers were positive for the organism. The presence of V. cholerae non-Ol in water supplies for human consumption in the city of Cam pee he and rural locality of Becal was investigated by Isaac-Marquez et al. (1998) . V. cholerae non-Ol was detected in 5.9% of the samples obtained in deep pools of Campeche. Studies conducted in Becat and the neighborhood of Morelos in Campeche indicated that collected samples harbored V. cholerae non-Ol in 31.5 and 8.7%, respectively. Clark et al. (1998a) reviewed the microbiology and epidemiology of the 1994 to 1995 cholera outbreak in the Ukraine. During this epidemic. 1 370 cases of cholera occurred with 32 fatalities. Isolates of V. cholerae 01, serotype Ogawa, biotype EI Tor were isolated from sewage, sea and surface water, freshwater, and marine fish. Because all but one of the environmental isolates were very similar to isolates from infected individuals, the authors concluded that environmental transmission was a significant factor in the epidemic. Molecular analysis of 37 V. cholerae and 4 non-cholera Vibrio isolates indicated that all Ukrainian toxigenic V. cholerae were closely related to each other and to an isolate from a patient from Pakistan. In addition, these strains were closely related to the seventh pandemic strains from Asia supporting the hypothesis that the Ukrainian epidemic of 1994 to 1995 was caused by toxigenic environmental strains surviving since the 1991 Ukrainian epidemic (Clark et aI., 1998b) .",

Aeromonas spp., gram negative, nonspore forming, 536 facultatively anaerobic bacilli belonging to the family Vibrionaceae are associated with a variety of infections in humans. Usually causing a mild, self-limiting diarrhea, which in some cases can become protracted and develop into chronic colitis, some members of the genus are also responsible for soft tissue infection and bacteraemia. Fioretini et a1. (1998) examined two estuaries, one of which received wastewater treatment system effluelH, on the Italian coast of the Adriatic Sea between September 1994 and August 1995 for the presence of Aeromanas spp. There was no correlation between water temperature and numbers of aero monads isolated. Isolates identified as Aeronomas caviae were the most prevalent in polluted water; while A. hydrophila was most often isolated from cleaner water. Borrell et aI. (1998) identified 938 Aeromonas isolates from environmental and clinical sources. Most pathogenic species were prevalent in environmental samples, with A. veronii biotype sobria being the most common in lakes and reservoirs and in treated drinking water and with A. caviae being the most common in seawater and milk products. Aeromonas hydrophila was the second most prevalent species isolated in untreated drinking water. A major drinking water distribution system in northeast Scotland was monitored over a 12-month period to determine the prevalence of mesophilic Aeromonas (Gavriel et aI., 1998) . Aeromonas were isolated from 21 of the 31 reservoirs. The probability of isolation typically decreased with increasing levels of chlorination. A seasonal pattern in the incidence of Aeromonas emerged with infrequent isolation during the winter period increasing to a peak during the summer. An association was demonstrated between the pattern of Aeromonas isolations and that of rainfall. No relationship was apparent between incidence of Aeromonas and total heterotrophic plate counts. Legnani et aI. (l998b) studied the occurrence of Aeromonas spp. in drinking water supplies in a mountain area in northeast Italy (the Dolomites). This water is exposed to a low level of pollution and systematic chemical disinfection is not used. Out of 7 395 water samples analysed over a 3-year period, I 623 were found to be positive for Aeromonas.",

Despite the lack of correlation between Aeromonas spp. and indicator organisms in certain water bodies during the winter, he suggested that standard fecal coliform analyses may adequately assess public health risks from Aeromonas spp. until a media capable of quantitative recovery of this organism is developed. Multiple antibiotic and heavy metal resistant strains of Aeromonas were isolated from raw drinking water supplies, irrigation waters, and runoff waters receiving sewage in Chili (Miranda and Castillo, 1998) . Moderately polluted waters showed lower antibiotic resistance and metal susceptability than either unpolluted or highly polluted ones. Antibiotic resistance could not be related to the level of fecal pollution. All Aeromonas spp. examined in a study by Sisti et al. (1998) were more susceptible to chlorine than Escherichia coli. The effect of the chlorine compound was markedly influenced by water temperature.

Persistence times within biofilms were much longer when they were determined by detection methods not involving culturing. Immunofluorescent-antibody staining demonstrated that the pathogen persisted up to the termination of the experiments after 28 and 42 days of incubation at 30 and 4\u00b0C, respectively. Hazeleger et al. (1998) examined the physiological activities of Campylobaeter at several environmental temperatures. Cellular activity, and hence persistence, could be measured at temperatures as low as 4\u00b0C. In addition, the organism was capable of chemotaxis and aerotaxis at all temperatures and thus may be able to move to more favorable Literature Review 1999 Measurement and Monitoring of Pollutants environments. Both osmolality and temperature were found to be significant factors in the persistence of Campylobaeter spp. (Reezal et al., 1998) . None of the Campy/obaeter examined (c. jejuni. C. lad. and E. coli) grew in media with an osmolality of 130 mosmal and a temperature below 42\u00b0C.",

Helieobaeter pylori could survive for up to 10 days in milk at 4\u00b0C storage but only 4 days in tap water with a steady decrease of colony-forming units. However, electron microscopy clearly showed that the nonculturable coccoid form was present in tap water that had been kept at 4\u00b0C for 7 days. Hulten et ai. (1998) analyzed municipal water, treated wastewater, and well water from Sweden for the presence of Helicobacter spp. using PCR analysis for DNA specific to this genus. They found 9 of the 24 wells, 3 of the 25 wastewater samples, and 3 of the 25 municipal tap water samples assayed were positive for Helicobacter indicating that this organism may be transmitted via water. In light of this possibility, it is interesting to note that Friis et al. (1998) found that wastewater treatment plant workers reported a higher incidence of peptic ulcer disease than other workers. Hegarty and Baker (1998) developed a combined fluorescent-antibody vital staining procedure for the detection and enumeration of H. pylori in water samples. Using this technique, they surveyed surface and groundwater samples in central Pennsylvania, U.S. H. pylori was detected in 77% of the samples analyzed. In 72% of these samples, no E. coli was detected. Johnson, Rice, and Reasoner (1997) studied three strains of Helicobacter pylori to determine their resistance to chlorination. The organisms were readily inactivated by free chlorine and therefore should be controlled by disinfection practices normally employed in the treatment of drinking water.",

Naegleria, Platyamoeba, Acanthamoeba, and two other genera of free-living amoebae, which may harbor Legionella, were det~cted in 22 samples from the sites. In addition, the authors noted that 13 water samples contained N. lovaniensis. Although N. lovaniensis is nonpathogenic, it is considered an indicator organism for places that are suitable for the growth of N. Jowleri, the causative agent of primary amoebic meningoencephalitis in man. These same authors (Kuroki et aI., I998b) surveyed the occurrence of both Legionella species and free-living amoebae in whirlpool baths installed in 11 private houses, 8 public baths, and 13 spas. Free-living amoebae that are known to be the hosts of Legione/la were isolated from 24 out of 32 water samples. Further studies were conducted for 10 consecutive weeks to monitor the occurrence of both free-living amoebae and Legionella in the whirlpool bathes of four private houses. Free-living amoebae, such as Hartmannella and Vexilli-Jera, and L. pneumophila were consistently isolated from all the water samples throughout the monitoring periods. Management practices such as frequent washing of filter elements or frequent 538 addition of tap water to bath basins was recommended to reduce microbial contaminants. Luck et al. (1998) used DNA restriction patterns to compare Legionella pneumonia isolated from a 44-year-old woman who developed pneumonia after cerebral surgery with isolates from water samples. When colonies from the water specimens were analyzed, a serogroup 12 strain complementary to that found in the clinical specimen was identified. In addition, the same serogroup one strain was isolated from the patient and the water system. Environmental cultures of hot water tanks, faucets, and showerheads were performed in six health care facilities in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, according to health department guidelines (Goetz et aI., 1998) . Legione/la was isolated from the water distribution system in 83% of the facilities. Fiore et al. (1998) investigated a pneumonia outbreak in a Pennsylvania town using epidemiological and molecular microbiological studies to determine the outbreak source and interrupt transmission of disease. Case-patients were more likely than controls to have been within 1 000 feet of the hospital during the 2 weeks prior to illness. Legione/la pneumophila serogroup 1 (Lp-l) was isolated from hospital cooling towers (CTs) and rooftop air samples but not from hospital potable water or community CTs. Hospital CT and air Lp-l isolates matched all five patient isolates.",

It was found that at temperatures between 4 and 20\u00b0C, Legionella organisms survived in salt solutions up to 3% NaCI. Only the combination of high temperatures, i.e., 30 and 37\u00b0C, with NaCl concentrations greater than 1.5%, reduced cell numbers significantly. It was interesting to note that the addition of small amounts of NaCl (0.] to 0.5%) enhanced survival of L. pneumophila, suggesting a protective effect of NaCI. To obtain information about conditions encountered in the environment, the survival experiments were repeated in sterile seawater from the Baltic Sea and the North Sea. The marked bacterial die-off, especially at higher temperatures, was not observed in natural seawater. All these results indicate that L. pneumophila can survive in the marine environment. Lin et al. (1998a) reviewed the factors promoting the colonization of water distribution systems with Legionella and methods to control the growth of this organism. Conditions within water systems that promote colonization included water temperature, configuration and age of the hot water tank, physicochemical constituents of the water, plumbing materials, and commensal microflora, while control measures included superheat-and-f1ush, copper-silver ionization, ultravioletlight, instantaneous heating systems, and hyperchlorination. They noted that although each of the disinfection methods has been proven to be effective in the short term, long-term disinfection has been difficult. Kool et al. (1998) found that hospitals supplied with drinking water containing free chlorine as a disinfectant were more likely to have a reported outbreak of Legionnaires' disease than those that used water with monochloramine as a disinfectant. On the basis of these observations, they suggested that 90% of the outbreaks associated with drinking water might not have occurred if monochloramine had been used for residual disinfection. Stout et al. (1998) compared the efficacy of metal ions versus the superheat-and-flush method of disinfection for the control of L.",

The authors concluded that a properly maintained and monitored copper-silver ionization system was more effective than the superheat-and-f1ush method for reducing the recovery of Legionella from the hospital water distribution system. A coppersilver ionization system was evaluated for the control of L. pneumophila in hot-water recirculation lines (Liu et aI., 1998) . Four weeks after activation of the system, no distal sites were positive for Legionella. Legionella recolonization did not occur for 6 to 12 weeks. A significantly higher copper concentration was found in the biofilm than in the bulk water. This is likely to be the reason that the copper-silver ionization system had the residual effect of preventing early recolonization. Steinert et al. (1998a) examined the factors involved in the occurrence of Legionellaceae in a hospital water system and the recontamination by Legionella pneumophila after a thermal disinfection procedure. Three months after the heat treatment (70 0c), the regrowth of the two prevalent Legionella strains reached the original level of cell numbers. Genetic analysis revealed the strains to be survivors of the decontamination.",

Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) organisms have been isolated from water and soil. It is now generally accepted that environmental sources, especially natural waters, are the reservoirs for most human infections caused by MAC. Wallace et al. (1998) reviewed nosocomial outbreaks and pseudo-outbreaks caused by the nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM). These outbreaks have been recognized for more than 20 years and continue to be a problem. Most of these outbreaks have involved the rapidly growing mycobacterial species Mycobacterium fortuitum and M. abscessus. The reservoir for these outbreaks is generally municipal and (often separate) hospital water supplies. They noted that these mycobacterial species and others are incredibly hardy, able to grow in municipal and distilled water, thrive at temperatures of 45\u00b0C or greater (M. xenopi and M. avium complex), and resist the activity of organomercurials, chlorine, 2% concentrations of formaldehyde and alkaline glutaraldehyde, and other commonly used disinfectants. Lin et al. (1998) found that Mycobacterium avium was significantly more resistant to disinfection with copper-silver ions than was Legionella pneumophila. Water, both in the city water supply and hospital environment, was found to be the major source of transmission of Mycobacterium xenopi, an opportunistic pathogen that causes pulmonary infections (Badalik et aI., 1998) . Steinert et al. (1998b) compared the growth of Mycobacterium avium in coculture with the free-living amoeba Acanthamoeba polyphaga with the growth of M. avium when it was separated from amoebae. Although viable mycobacteria were observed within amoebal vacuoles, there was no significant difference between bacterial growth in coculture and bacterial growth separately. In contrast, Legionella pneumophila multiplied only in coculture.",

Issues that are currently being addressed include whether wastewater treatment workers should be vaccinated against hepatitis A (Warlen and Hoff. 1998) . Using the salivary assay for IgG anti-HAY Brugha et al. (1998) studied 241 employees of a water and sewerage company who may have had occupational exposure to sewage. They determined that exposure to raw wastewater was a significant risk factor for hepatitis A and that this was independent of other known risk factors. In a crosssectional study the employees of a wastewater treatment plant were tested for hepatitis B virus (HBV) markers-HBsAg, anti-HBs, anti-HBc-to determine the prevalence of HBV infection and assess the risk of exposed wastewater workers becoming infected to evaluate the necessity for appropriate vaccination (Arvanitidou et aI., 1998) . The overall prevalence of HBV markers was 43.9% with 6.6% of the employees being HBsAg carriers. Logistic regression analysis confirmed that only exposure to wastewater was independently associated with positivity for HBV infection. The authors concluded that workers exposed to wastewater should be vaccinated against hepatitis B virus. Salano and Copello (1998) , on the other hand, found no evidence of an increased prevalence of positive hepatitis A markers in a study on occupational risks of a group of wastewater workers of the city of Genoa versus a control group of nonexposed subjects. Arnal et al. (1998) used RT-PCR to detect the hepatitis A virus (HAV) genome in HAV-contaminated artificial seawater and compared it to HA V detection in cell culture. In the former, the genome was detectable for 232 days compared with 35 days for cell culture. These result~indicated that ability to detect the genome may not be a valid indicator of viral survival in cell culture and suggested the need for additional studies on the effect of environmental factors in seawater on genome stability and maintenance of viral infectivity. Divizia et al. (1998) used an antigen capture PCR (AC-PCR) technique followed by membrane hybridization to detect hepatitis A viruses in wastewater. Assays of 10 samples each of raw wastewater, wastewater after oxidation, and the final effluent indicated a decline in the number of hepatitis A positive samples. However, finding hepatitis A viruses in the effluent of the treatment plant indicates it may be a source of environmental contamination. Jothikumar et al. (1998) used immunomagnetic capture (IC) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques to concentrate hepatitis A (HA V) virus from environmental samples. They determined this technique was able to detect less than one plaque-forming unit (PFU) of HA V in water and wastewater and was specific for HA V. Clayson et al. (1998) studied a hepatitis outbreak that occurred from January 29, 1995 , to March 15, 1995 , in a military training camp in Nepal. Sera from patients and soldiers not exhibiting symptoms were tested for hepatitis A, B, C, and E using commercially available ELISA kits. PCR was also used to detect hepatitis E virus, which was determined to be the cause of the outbreak. The source was thought to be fecally contaminated drinking water. Of the 488 soldiers not exhibiting symptoms, 83 were found to be recently infected without experiencing symptoms of the disease. It was suggested that the inapparent infection detected may be a typical response in areas endemic for the disease.",

Tomar (1998) reported on information obtained from examination of 10500 cases of hepatitis E virus in pediatric populations. The vast majority of cases were associated with fecal contamination of drinking water, and the author suggested the use of a residual chlorine concentration of at least 0.5 mgfL for a minimum of 30 minutes to prevent outbreaks of this disease. Vitral et al. (1998) studied two populations from low socioeconomic areas in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, for their age-specific prevalence of anti-hepatitis A antibodies (anti-HA V). Sera from the two populations was collected in 1978 (population 1, neonates to age 6) and 1995 (population 2, ages 1 to 23). They found a difference in the levels of antibodies in the two groups with population I having a higher incidence of anti-HAY (65.5%) compared with 32.1 % for population 2. They also noted a lower exposure of young children in population 2 compared with that of population 1. These results may have reflected the better living conditions of the children in population 2 who had access to safer water and better sanitation.",

At least 80 persons displayed symptoms of the illness. Poor chlorination was probably the cause of the outbreak (residual chlorine less than 0.2 mgfL) because after hyperchlorination the spread of adenoviruses stopped. They noted that rapid detection of adenoviruses in the municipal swimming pool water by nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification allowed quick control of the outbreak. Castignolles et a!. (1998) detected adenovirus in nucleic-acid extracts from the Seine River estuary by a two-step amplification of a 220-bp segment of the conserved coding region of type 2 adenovirus hexon protein L3. The primers used in this study detected the most prevalent adenovirus serotypes in human disease in France but not other virus strains or bacteria. Pina et al. (1998b) used PCR to detect human viruses in wastewater (urban and slaughterhouse), shellfish, and river and seawater. Their results indicated that both the adenoviruses and the hepatitis A viruses detected in the environment came primarily from humans, with the former being the most frequently detected virus over the course of a year. All enterovirus and HA V positive samples were also positive for human adenoviruses suggesting the use of PCR to detect adenoviruses as an indicator of human viruses in environmental samples.",

They considered a variety of applications using data from California on enteric virus concentrations in unchlorinated secondary effluents. They used the reliability criterion of meeting less than 10-4 annual risk of infection at least 95% of the time. They indicated the need for a larger enteric database and the use of standardized protocols. Vantarakis and Papapetropoulou (1998) compared the use of nested PCR and cell culture to detect enteroviruses from 120 coastal water samples from the Greek Achaia coastline. They found nestl~d PCR to be an effective method for the detection of both enteroviruses and adenoviruses. They also reported that the presence of these viruses did not correlate with the presence of bacterial fecal indicators in the waters tested. Li et al.

They suggested that the 340 cases reported in North Thames in the spring of 1997 resulted from ingestion of tap water that was obtained from a deep chalk borehole. It was not known how the oocysts gained entrance to the borehole.",

Cryptosporodium and Giardia are the two most widely recognized protozoan pathogens for which a waterborne route of transmission has been demonstrated. Both cause chronic diarrheal disease, particularly in immunosuppressed individuals. The organisms undergo a complex life cycle during which cysts or oocysts are produced. These structures are highly resistant to disinfection but still remain infectious. Infectious dose for both organisms is extremely low with as few as 10 to 30 cysts or oocysts capable of causing clinical infection. Cryptosporidium is now recognized as a common cause of diarrhea throughout the world. Although more than 20 species of Cryptosporidium are now recognized, only one, C. parvum is considered to be a human pathogen. Giardiasis is caused by Giardia lamblia, recently renamed G. duodenalis.",

Using this technique allows for the differentiation of multiple types of the parasite. Brasseur et al. (1998) indicated that excystation alone is not a valid indication of oocyst viability. They suggest that infectivity for enterocytic Cac02 tissue cells provides the necessary specific information on the viability of C. parvum oocysts. Deng and Cliver (1998) used genomic DNA isolated from Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts by a specific immunomagnetic separation-in vitro excystation procedure and subjected to randomly amplified polymorphic DNA analysis using sequence-independent primers to differentiate strains of C. parvum isolated from different sources. Using this technique, an estuary C. parvum isolate was easily differentiated from several bovine isolates, while five bovine isolates of the same origin were indistinguishable from each other. Bukhari et al. (1998) compared immunomagnetic separation (IMS) kits for the separation and concentration of C. parvum oocysts in waters with turbidity levels that ranged from 50 to 500 nephelometric turbidity units. The effect of oocyst age on recovery was also studied using one of the commercial kits. The results obtained were variable depending on the kit used and the level of turbidity present. Sartory et al. (1998b) studied the recovery of Cryptosporidiium oocysts from water using a novel filter system. The ability of this system to recover oocysts from various volumes of tap and river water inoculated with a range of organisms was in the 90% range. After using a potassium citrate flotation concentrate to further purify the cysts, recovery levels were 60%. The authors indicated this is superior to conventional methods of oocyst recovery that use wound cartridge and membrane filters. A RT-PCR method for simultaneous detection of Cryptosporidum and Giardia (oo)cysts that can be used for the direct analysis of primary water concentrates was developed by Kaucner and Stinear (1998) . The technique was compared with an immunofluorescence assay using concentrated env.ironmental samples. The RT-PCR technique resulted in an increase in the detection of viable Giardia cysts, but fewer positive samples of viable Cryptosporidium were detected, suggesting that species other than parvum were present in the water. Matheson et al. (1998) report on the Gelman Envirochek capsule, which is used to concentrate Cryptosporidium and Giardia (oo)cysts from water. They indicate that multiple samples can be treated in 1 hour and after concentration any purification technique can be used. Studies indicate that recovery for Giardia (80%) is higher than that for Cryptosporidium (70%). Thiriat et al. (1998) determined that Giardia cysts could be quantified using direct immunofluorescence and their viability confirmed using the fluorogenic dyes (4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) DAPI and propidium iodide (PI) along with differential interference microscopy (DlC). Using Giardia cysts obtained from feces and wastewater sludge, they indicated that they obtained significantly better results than when standard counting methods were employed.",

Results suggested that waterborne contamination may be a major factor in spreading infection and that the incidence of the disease may not be associated other factors such as contact with animals, nutritional status, and parental education. Saredi and Bava (1998) studied the incidence of Crypfosporidium in hospitalized pediatric patients.

They found a high incidence of Cryptosporidium in these individuals, although thl~y did not exhibit the characteristic disease symptoms associated with these organisms such as diarrhea. It was suggested that these individuals may function as carriers potentially introducing the pathogens into water. Perz et al. (1998) used a risk analysis approach to determine the role of tap water in the spread of Cryptosporidium using adults and children with and without AIDS as four population subgroups. Applying their model to the New York City population, they calculated the numbers of tap water-related cases per year in the AIDS subgroups to be 34 and in the non-AIDS subgroups to be 6. Eisenberg et al. (1998) analyzed data from the 1993 Milwaukee Cryptosporidium outbreak (March 23) to develop a model of the epidemic. They determined that an earlier outbreak occurred on March 1 and suggested that if this one had been detected, 85% of the subsequent cases might have been prevented. Their data also suggested a 3 to 7 day incubation period, increased levels of oocysts in the water, and a decrease in the treatment efficiency of the water. Morris et al. (1998) carried out a reu'ospective study to determine if there were Cryptosporidium outbreaks in Milwaukee that preceded the massive April 1993 outbreak. They examined hospital data as well as turbidity data from the Milwaukee water works and determined that for more than a year before the 1993 outbreak there was an association between cases of gastroenteritis and turbidity. They noted the lag period observed between increased turbidity and cases of gastroenteritis was similar to that observed in the 1993 outbreak. They concluded that drinking water associated cases of cryptosporidiosis occurred before the 1993 outbreak. Griffin et a!. (I998) carried out a telephone survey questioning individuals in Milwaukee, the site of the massive 1993 Cryptosporium outbreak. A total of 610 people participated in the study. The results indicated that the media served as the main source of information for many individuals, strongly influencing their concerns about the possibility of future infections by Cryptosporium. Proctor et a!. (1998) studied data that were available during the Milwaukee Crypt~sporidium outbreak. They suggested that the use of surrogate measurements of morbidity, which are available prior to laboratory results, can help lower the magnitude of outbreaks. Various methods that may be applied in these situations were discussed.",

            "text": "After observing long term survival of Cryptosporidium in artificial seawater, Fayer et a!. (I 998a) studied the ability of oysters to take up (oo)cysts. Oysters from Chesapeake Bay were obtained and examined for the presence of both Giardia and Cryptosporidium using immunofluorescence and bioassays. Giardia was not found in any of the samples. Cryptosporidium was found indicating that oysters in natural waters can be a source of infection. The ability of oysters to take up infectious oocysts from seawater was tested by Xiao et a!. (1998) who used strain-specific diagnostic tools based on 18S ribosomal RNA sequence variations to detect organisms in a variety of samples. They found Cryptosporidium genotype I associated with human diseases and genotype 2 in the majority of oysters that they obtained from Chesapeake Bay, suggesting that oysters may be used as indicators of the quality of estuarine waters. In a study by Graczyk et a!. (1998a) , Asian freshwater clams (Corbicula fluminea) were exposed to Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts for 24 hours. By this time, oocysts were no longer detectable in the water. Acid fast staining and immunofluorescent antibody (IFA) techniques were used to assay the clams for oocysts with the highest levels of recovery obtained when IFA was used on tissues from the gills and GI tract. Oocysts released from the clams were consistently found associated with fecal matter. Fayer et al. (1998b) tested the ability of oocysts obtained from calves and held at various temperatures and times to infect neonatal BALB/c mice. Cyst infectivity was determined by microscopic observation of developmental stages in sections of mouse gut or a positive PCR for C. parvum DNA in samples of mouse ileum. Oocysts held from 0 to 20\u00b0C were found to be infectious even after 24 weeks, with levels of infectivity varying depending on the time and temperature of storage in deionized water. Youssef et al. (1998) used direct fluorescent monoclonal antibodies and Ziehl-Neelsen staining to detect Cryptosporidium parvum in various Alexandria, Egypt, water sources. They found C. parvum in uncovered water tanks, associated with the shore area near two canals and in one swimming pool. Although they found the direct fluorescence technique to be more sensitive in C. parvum detection, the alternative method allowed for the detection of other pathogen protozoans. Hirata and Hashimoto (1998) determined that microfiltration (MF) and ultrafiltration (UF) were appropriate methods for drinking water treatment. Bench-scale experiments were run using MF (nominal pore size of 0.25 jJ.m) and UF (nominal molecular weight cutoff of 13 000 daltons) modules in a cross-flow mode. Results from studies in which 10 6 oocysts/L were tested with both modules and higher levels tested with MF indicate that this technology can be used to remove high levels of oocysts from contaminated influent waters. The use of membrane filtration for the removal of 544 Cryptosporidium and Giardia (oo)cysts was studied by Falk et al. (1998) . After filtration, the (oo)cysts were observed using phase contrast microscopy and counted using a haemocytometer. The method was found to be more effective for the removal of Giardia cysts. Studies by Hoffman et a!. (1998) indicate that chlorine dioxide may be a more appropriate disinfectant than chlorine in treating waters with Cryptosporidium contamination.",

Once attached, the sedimentation velocity of the (oo)cysts was determined by the size of the associated particle. The authors suggested that (oo)cyst attachment to particles plays a major role in the subsequent fate of the organisms. Emerging Protozoan Pathogens: Cyclosporidia, Microsporidia, and Toxoplasma. With the increased number of immunosuppressed individuals in the population in recent decades, several new protozoan pathogens have been recognized. Cyclosporidia cayetanensis is a recently described protozoon associated with prolonged self-limiting and relapsing diarrhea. It has a worldwide distribution with a higher prevalence in tropical and subtropical countries. The first known human cases of illness caused by Cyclospora infection (i.e., cyclosporiasis) were reported in 1979. Cases began being reported more often in the mid-1980s. Microsporidia are obligately parasitic protozoa that lack mitochondira. They are becoming increasingly well known in the medical arena through pathologies they cause in hu'mans with impaired immune systems. Several species of microsporidia infect HIV-positive patients. Most frequent is Enterocytozoon bieneusi. Encephalitozoon hellem and cuniculi, and a new species designated Septata, have also been reported to cause human disease. Toxoplasma gondii is a ubiquitous organism that can cause several clinical syndromes in animals and humans, including one of the most common central nervous system infections in patients with AIDS. Graczyk et a1. (1998b) introduced Asian freshwater clams (Corbicula fluminea) into waters contaminated with Cyclospora cayetanensis oocysts. After 24 hours oocysts were not observed in the water. Analysis of clam hemolymph and gill smears indicated the clams had taken up the Cyclospora, although by day 18 postexposure oocysts were not recoverable from the clam tissue or feces. Additional experiments indicated that the number of oocysts recovered decreased as a function of clam size. The .results obtained in this study suggest that C. jluminea can be used as a biological indicator for contamination with C. cayetanesis oocysts. Sturbaum et a1. (1998) attempted to detect Cyclospora oocysts in wastewater using current techniques. The detection of Cyclospora cayetanensis indicate that contaminated wastewater may be a source of the pathogen.",

(1998) developed a simple procedure using Ascaris suum as a model for Ascaris lumbricoides in testing the ability of sludge treatment processes to kill the eggs of parasitic roundwornls. After 1 week in a mesophilic anaerobic digester, 95% of A. mum eggs produced two-cell larvae into vitro, with 86% progressing to motile larvae. After 5 weeks in the digester 51 % progressed to motile larvae. Between 42 and 49% of eggs stored in a sludge lagoon for 29 weeks were viable and able to develop motile larvae.",

            "text": "Cercarial dermatitis (swimmer's itch) is an inflammatory response to penetration of skin by schistosome parasites while swimming or wading in lakes. Lindblade (1998) investigated risk factors for cercarial dermatitis to determine whether limnological characteristics of the lake were associated with development of the condition. Factors associated with the development of cercarial dermatitis identified in the study included age, the time of day at which exposure to lake water occurred, and the month in which exposure to lake water took place. In addition, development of cercarial dermatitis was significantly associated with exposure to lake water in the area of the lake with the highest algae content and shallowest depth. Chamot et a1. (1998) investigated the occurrence of cercaria! dermatitis in Geneva, Switzerland. Overall, 153 bathers out of 555 reported probable cercarial dermatitis. Of the cases, ] 1.1% noticed more than 30 skin lesions, 19.6% described severe itching, 50.3% used a drug treatment, 3.9% visited a doctor, ,md ]5% claimed they would reduce their bathing activities. History of cercarial dermatitis, time spent in the water, hour of the day, barometric: pressure, and maximum daily atmospheric temperature predicted disease occurrence in multivariate analysis. Although a benign disease, cercarial dermatitis may have a negative effect on the local water recreation industry. ",
