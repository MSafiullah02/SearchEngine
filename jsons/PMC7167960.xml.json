She had no history of asthma or foreign body aspiration, but did have a history of suspected abdominal trauma. Physical examination showed subcutaneous emphysema of the extremities and above the clavicles. Chest radiograph showed subcutaneous emphysema and pneumomediastinum (Fig. 1a). Also, thorax computed tomography (CT) indicated pneumomediastinum, interstitial emphysema and epidural emphysema (Fig. 1b). Pulmonary function tests and oxygen saturation were normal. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of the nasal secretions obtained on the fourth day was positive for human rhinovirus. Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydophila pneumoniae IgG and IgM were serologically negative. Antinuclear antibody (ANA) and anti\u2010double stranded DNA were investigated to rule out connective tissue diseases and were found to be negative. \u03b1\u20101\u2010Anti\u2010trypsin was assessed for interstitial emphysema and was normal. The patient was given 100% oxygen therapy and also given antibiotics empirically. She recovered uneventfully and was discharged after 6 days.",

Asymptomatic patients and those with minimal neurological symptoms due to PR associated with pneumomediastinum or pneumothorax are efficiently managed conservatively with high\u2010flow oxygen inhalation, which enhances reabsorption of the air by nitrogen washout, and further helps in symptomatic improvement in high\u2010pressure PR, in which air under pressure has entered the epidural space.4 Thus PR should be treated based on etiology and severity of symptoms; surgery, antibiotics, foreign body removal from the trachea, and bronchodilators in chronic bronchitis will be used on a case\u2010by\u2010case basis.3\n",
