Timely recognition and treatment of the acutely ill and injured at the appropriate levels of the health system are fundamental to the quality and safety of healthcare. This is particularly true in the emergency care environment where delivering care is uniquely challenging, particularly for emergency nurses whose practice is starkly different to other nursing specialties 2 . Emergency nurses assess and initiate care for patients of all ages, with varying degrees of clinical urgency and illness severity, most of whom are undiagnosed and undifferentiated. Failure to recognise and respond to clinical deterioration during emergency care increases the incidence of high-mortality adverse events both during emergency care but also following the emergency care episode, irrespective of whether the patient is admitted to hospital or discharged 3, 4 . 2020 is the WHO year of the Nurse and Midwife. Nurses are by far the largest proportion of the professional health workforce. Achieving universal health coverage globally will depend on them being able to use their knowledge and skills to the full extent of their scope. Yet they are, too often, undervalued, and their contribution underestimated. Nurses are positioned and poised to facilitate the wider triple impact of improving health, promoting gender equality and supporting economic growth 5 of individuals, families and societies globally.",

The resolution is sympathetic to the shortage of permanent staff assigned to emergency units and the lack of standards for clinical management and documentation but noted that many high-impact improvements in emergency care can be made at very low cost. These include implementing systematic processes to improve the quality of emergency care and save lives. For example, the use of a formal triage protocol in emergency units to prioritize care based on a patient's needs rather than the order of arrival improves outcomes even where resources are limited. Structured checklists are also known to be an effective low-cost way to enable recognition of life-threatening conditions for critical actions by healthcare personnel 6 .",

Standardised patient assessment during emergency care beyond the ABC of Airway, Breathing and Circulation is required. A more comprehensive assessment is crucial. Emergency nurses are responsible for the initial assessment, management and safety of critically ill and injured patients. They are the first and sometimes only clinicians that patients see, so the quality of their initial assessment and ongoing treatment is vital 5 . This is especially so in times of epidemics and pandemics, such as the current COVID-19. Emergency nurses must perform a comprehensive assessment and escalate care to meet the clinical needs of patients. This may also include ordering and interpreting investigations (e.g. pathology tests) and performing interventions (e.g. analgesia) as clinically indicated. The quality and timeliness of emergency nurses' assessment is crucial as patients seeking emergency care often have extended wait times for medical review. Emergency nurses' assessment findings underpin clinical decisions by all members of the emergency care team and promotes safe care by preventing, detecting and acting upon deterioration. We propose a nursing solution for emergency care delivery that addresses many of the WHA draft resolutions 1 .",
