The impact of locally produced disinfectant with operational training as a means to improve hygiene in resource-limited healthcare facilities and prevent HAI was evaluated. Method: In Burkina Faso, 4 types of electro-chlorinator devices that convert salt and water into sodium hypochlorite through electrolysis were installed in 26 healthcare facilities distributed across 3 sanitary districts. The program was evaluated at 4 months and 11 months and performance compared with a control group. Results: After 11 months, over 90% of the facilities applied 8 of the 11 essential hygiene practices defined by the Ministry of Health, compared to 20% in the control group. 61.5% of the healthcare facilities improved the chlorine concentration of their sodium hypochlorite solutions, reaching an average concentration of 5.1 g/L compared to an average of 2.1 g/L in the control group. Additionally, a cost-benefit analysis demonstrated that locally produced sodium hypochlorite led to daily savings ranging between 2.7 and 53 euros depending on the device compared with the purchase of chlorine tablets. Conclusion: Results, therefore, suggest that electro-chlorinator devices in addition to hygiene sensitization can be a simple, cost-effective and tailored intervention to reduce the prevalence of HAI in low-resource settings.",

            "text": "Healthcare-associated infections (HAI), also known as nosocomial infections, are acquired by patients during the process of care in a hospital or other healthcare facility [1, 2] . Such infections are major contributors to morbidity and mortality and point to insufficient hygiene practices within the healthcare facility [3, 4] . The propagation of HAI either occurs through parenteral or airborne transmission, in addition to hand contamination [3] . As such, insufficient disinfection of the medical equipment, lack of asepsis during intrusive interventions and hand contamination by the medical staff significantly increase the risk of HAI within healthcare facilities [3] . While extensive data has been gathered on the prevalence of HAI in developed countries, such statistical information is particularly scarce in developing countries [1, 3, 4] . A systematic literature review conducted by the WHO estimates that the prevalence of HAI among hospitalized patients in developed countries revolves around 7.6% [1] . Research conducted on the prevalence of surgical site infection discloses that the rate of HAI in low and middle countries varies between 1.2 and 23.6%, while the rate in developed countries ranges from 1.2 to 5.2% [1] . HAI can be prevented by improving sanitation and hygiene, including safe medical waste disposal, toilet sanitation, hand washing and access to safe drinking water [5, 6] . Sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) is an important chemical disinfectant that is widely used in health care exhibiting a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity [7, 8] . The biocidal effect of sodium hypochlorite varies depending on the microorganism. For example, 0.1% (1000 ppm) sodium hypochlorite significantly reduces human coronavirus and human parainfluenza virus infectivity on surfaces within 1 min exposure time while a solution of approximately 5000 ppm hypochlorite applied for 1 min produced a 99.9% reduction in hepatitis A virus. WHO recommends sodium hypochlorite at 0.5% or 5 g/L (equivalent to 5000 ppm) for disinfecting surfaces at health care settings and that a minimum residual chlorine concentration of 0.2 ppm is present in drinking water [1, 9] . As such, promoting access to sodium hypochlorite in healthcare facilities can contribute to the improvement of sanitation and hygiene, thereby reducing the prevalence of HAI and generating savings [10] .",

The compliance with the eleven essential hospital hygiene practices defined by the Ministry of Health and the regional health authority, which must be applied systematically to guarantee optimal hygiene in health care facilities, was evaluated by a series of questions and visual inspection on site (Appendix 1). Some health centers were evaluated on less than 11 essential practices because they do not perform childbirth and 3 practices are linked to it. Therefore, it is the % of implementation that was taken into account. 2. Adaptability. To evaluate if WATA device technology is indeed adapted to the wide diversity of facilities the frequency of use, reliability (amount of production) and storage conditions of the sodium hypochlorite generated were evaluated. Questions like: Do you still need to buy/look for chlorine in the market? How often? Were applied in the supervision grid. 3. Quality control of the production. The control of the chlorine concentration of the sodium hypochlorite produced with the electro-chlorinator devices was performed with the WataTest, a reagent that makes it possible to determine the concentration of active chlorine (Cl2, HOCL, OCL-) of any chlorinated solution, in grams per liter, in a range of 1e7 g/L (0.1e0.7% of active chlorine and 0.32e2.23 Cl) with an accuracy of AE0.5 g/ L. The daily control of the production was performed by the WataTest but for the evaluation carried during supervisions the thiosulphate titration test was chosen to provide better accuracy. 4. Cost-effectiveness. Evaluating the savings that can be incurred by using electro-chlorinator devices to produce a sufficient amount of sodium hypochlorite as opposed to purchasing chlorine tablets. WATA devices are guaranteed for 2 years by the manufacturer but have a much longer lifespan when used correctly (4e5 years easily). The main goal was, therefore, to evaluate if these devices are profitable before the end of their service life so that they can be replaced, if necessary, with the money saved by their use to obtain an economically sustainable system. The analysis took the production costs entailed by the WATA devices into account, namely energy, salt, water and supervision cost. The time dedicated to training was not included as training is also necessary when using chlorine tablets.",

This result however improved after 11 months, where 73% (16 out of 22) of the facilities reported using their device at least every other day. This result may have been impacted by the fact that most hygiene facilities were initially not applying all 11 of the hygiene practices defined by the Health Ministry. As a result, these facilities may have been under-using their electro-chlorinator devices. This hypothesis is supported by the data collected after 11 months, in which a higher percentage of facilities report using their device every other day. The awareness campaigns relating to the importance of hygiene in healthcare facilities and the availability of chlorine solution may have improved the compliance of the medical staff with hygiene practices [14] . The average percentage of health units that experienced a problem with WATA during a month was 4.3% compared to 7.7% during the first supervision which is low.",

The data collected after 11 months, however, suggested improvement as (8 out of 13) 61.5% of the facilities were producing a disinfection solution of adequate concentration. The rising percentage of facilities abiding by the concentration standards suggests that some time may be necessary to allow the users of electro-chlorinator devices to familiarize themselves with the WATA technology and reach an adequate chlorine concentration of at least 5 g/L. The data gathered after 11 months allows for a comparison between the sample and the control group. 61.5% of the facilities with access to electro-chlorinator devices were found to have a solution with a chlorine concentration equivalent to or higher than 5 g/L. However, this threshold of chlorine concentration wasn't reached by any of the facilities belonging to the control group, which were using other chlorine types found on the market such as chlorine tablets or bleach. These results, therefore, highlight the imperative need for a chlorination method such as electrochlorinator devices to allow healthcare facilities to produce a disinfectant of sufficient quality and an adequate chlorine concentration.",

The provision of electrochlorinator devices in healthcare facilities allowed these structures to have access to sufficient amounts of sodium hypochlorite, which promoted compliance with the eleven essential hygiene practices defined by the Ministry of Health. Besides, a cost-benefit analysis confirmed that the initial investment cost for a WATA device could be offset within the first year and that sodium hypochlorite production through an electro-chlorinator device generated significant savings in comparison to the daily purchase of chlorine tablets. Therefore, electro-chlorinator devices in addition to sensitization to essential hygiene practice could be a simple, costeffective and tailored alternative to reduce the prevalence of health acquired infections in low-resource settings.",
