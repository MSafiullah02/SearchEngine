The mortality rate in SARI is high in developing countries compared to developed countries although the morbidity rate remains more or less the same globally [1]. According to the global burden of diseases (GBD) study in 2015, ARTIs including SARI caused 2.74 million deaths in children under 5 years of age [2]. Around 70% of these deaths have been reported from Africa and Southeast Asia [3]. ARTIs in children are commonly caused by viruses such as influenza A and B, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza virus 1, 2 and 3 (PIV 1\u20133), adenoviruses, rhinoviruses, coronaviruses, human bocavirus (HBoV), enteroviruses and human metapneumovirus (hMPV) [4]. Despite the extensive laboratory detection and characterization of these viruses, almost 50% of ARTIs in children remain without an aetiological diagnosis [5].",

These findings support the notion that hMPV is not a new respiratory virus [5]. hMPV detection rates among children with ARTI are usually between 6 and 40% [5]. hMPV has a global incidence of 5 to 10% in children with ARTIs especially causing infection in less than 2 year olds [1, 5]. Seroprevelence studies indicate that more than 90% of children between the ages of 5 to 10 have already encountered the virus [1].",

In addition, other respiratory symptoms like cough, coryza, dyspnoea, fever and hypoxia may or may not be present in children with hMPV associated ARTI.

Studies show that co-infection rates of hMPV lie within 5 to 17% [5]. Many studies reveal that there is no direct correlations between co-infection and disease severity [5]. Since viral ARTI being the second leading cause of hospitalization in developing countries in the South Asia including Sri Lanka, research on viral ARTI is a top priority. Although hMPV has been known as a cause of ARTI in children more than a decade, only a couple of published papers are available in Sri Lanka [9, 10]. Thus this study aimed to detect respiratory viruses including hMPV in a selected group of children affected by a mini outbreak of SARI presented to the Teaching Hospital, Peradeniya (THP), Sri Lanka.",

Stained slides were examined under the fluorescence microscope and positive results were recorded based on the apple green fluorescence emission from infected cells.

This agrees with many other studies that indicate co-infection rates within the range of 5 to 17% [5]. Majority of the hMPV co-infections occurs with RSV [7] and this might be due to a mathematical chance for the presence of RSV as it is the number one cause of ARTI in children globally. In the current study, two out of the three co-infections detected were with RSV. Our study did not find a significant difference in terms of disease severity between hMPV co-infections and mono-infections as reported previously [5].",

Wheezing has been reported in hMPV infection in children [1, 14] and in our study wheezing was detected in 6 out of the 18 children. Fever, cough, and dyspnoea were common symptoms present in the current study sample with hMPV infection as reported by previous studies [1, 14]. Seven of the 18 children had diarrhoea, although diarrhoea has been indicated in studies before in association with adenovirus infections, its association with hMPV infection has not been reported [7, 8].",
