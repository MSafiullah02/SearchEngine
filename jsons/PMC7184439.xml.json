Moreover, the authors highlighted that hydroxychloroquine half maximal effective concentration values \u201ctended to decrease with longer incubation times\u201d and that, in the simulation model, the lung trough concentrations were still above the target concentration on day 10 after a 5-day course of hydroxychloroquine.",

Accidently infected HCWs represent an important source of infection during the period that they are asymptomatic or presymptomatic, as they can transmit the virus to household contacts and to patients seeking medical care for reasons unrelated to SARS-CoV-2 infection. For these reasons, we suggest preventive strategies for those accidentally exposed to SARS-CoV-2 such as preexposure or postexposure prophylaxis to avoid viral transmission, as largely accepted for those exposed to other viral agents such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) [2].",

In contrast, no similar effect on early phases of coronavirus infection has been reported for other drugs proposed for SARS-CoV-2 treatment, which are able to interfere only after cell infection, affecting protease cleavage (protease inhibitors) or viral genome replication (remdesivir or ribavirin). These effects of chloroquine on early phases of viral replication permit the attenuation of vertical transmission in an animal model of Zika virus infection, significantly reducing brain viral load, and make cells refractory to SARS-CoV infection in an in vitro model [4, 5].",

Hydroxychloroquine\u2019s effectiveness profile, its ability to inhibit lung viral replication for a 10-day period after only a 5-day cycle of therapy, and the large amounts of knowledge in term of safety deriving from its use for malaria prophylaxis and rheumatologic diseases lead us to recommend its preexposure or postexposure use for those performing procedures at high risk of viral diffusion in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.",
