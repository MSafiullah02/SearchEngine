In our study, we collected multiple pulmonary CT scans for every patient from disease onset to exacerbation. All patients had a repeated chest CT examination within a 2\u20135-day interval during hospitalisation. Thus, we could completely observe the dynamic changes of pulmonary lesions. Our study showed some common CT findings in COVID-19 patients after exacerbation: GGO with consolidation, bilateral, multifocal, patchy shadowing, and air bronchogram sign. After exacerbation, the median number of involved lobes and CT scores was 5 and 12, respectively. Compared with previous studies [6], we considered that the severity of chest CT images was higher than expected when patients met diagnostic criteria for only mild or common pneumonia, and not severe or fatal pneumonia. However, after analysing the statistics of patients who met diagnostic criteria for severe or fatal pneumonia after exacerbation, we found that there were significant differences in their CT scores and number of involved lobes. At the same time, we found that CT score can accurately distinguish the exacerbation stages in patients from disease onset to exacerbation. When the cutoff value of the CT score was 5, it could have good sensitivity and specificity with a moderate predictive value. A possible explanation for the results is that there could be a relationship between the changes noted in the chest CT and pneumonia exacerbation. If the changes could be detected before the exacerbation of COVID-19 pneumonia, we could infer that the changes would predict an acute exacerbation.",

In our study, the average age of patients who had a history of exacerbation was older, and a high proportion had comorbidities. This suggests that age and comorbidity may be risk factors for poor outcome. This study provides information on the epidemiology of the COVID-19 patients in Hunan province with severe disease, approximately half of whom had a history of visiting Wuhan. This might be related to susceptibility of patients rather than the history of their visiting Wuhan. Compared with symptoms in patients before exacerbation, symptoms, including dyspnoea and respiratory distress, were more common after exacerbation. Thus, increasing dyspnoea and respiratory distress should alert physicians to identify patients with exacerbations timeously. Other factors such as worsened laboratory parameters including elevated white blood cell count, neutrophil count, blood urea nitrogen, and lactate dehydrogenase, decreased albumin, and shortened activated partial thromboplastin time were noted in patients after exacerbation. These may be associated with bacterial infection, coagulation activation, kidney dysfunction, and myocardial injury. These results will be helpful in future studies to explore possible mechanisms of these associations.",

First, with the limited number of patients, it is difficult to avoid selection bias and explain the main factor for disease exacerbation or the relationship between clinical and radiological findings with multivariable analysis. This is a small-sized case study of patients with an acute exacerbation. Stricter inclusion and exclusion criteria would help to further define the changes in disease, including clinical and radiological findings.",

There are significant differences in clinical, laboratory, and CT findings in patients at disease onset compared with those in patients with an exacerbation of their condition. Chest CT plays a critical role in timely detecting the exacerbation of disease. An increase in the number of involved lobes or an increased CT score from the baseline may predict a poor clinical outcome. Combining assessment of CT changes with clinical and laboratory changes could help clinical teams to evaluate the prognosis of COVID-19 patients.",
