            "text": "To identify the studies most relevant for this focused review, we queried PubMed. For practicality and relevance, our search, summarized in Fig. 3\n, was limited to papers from the last ten years. As our review is focused on infectious disease transmission network inference, we started with the keywords \u2018transmission\u2019 and \u2018epidemiological\u2019. To ensure that we captured studies that incorporate pathogen genomic data, we added the keywords \u2018genetic\u2019, \u2018genomic\u2019 and \u2018phylogenetic\u2019 giving 5557 articles total. Next, to narrow the results to those that are comprised of a study of multi-modal data, we found that the keywords \u2018combining\u2019 or \u2018integrating\u2019 alongside \u2018Bayesian inference\u2019 or \u2018inference\u2019 were comprehensive. These filters yielded 73 and 61 articles in total. We found that some resulting articles focused on outbreak detection, sexually transmitted diseases, laboratory methods, and phylogenetic analysis. Also, the focus of several articles was to either overlay information from different modalities or to sequentially analyze them to eliminate unlikely transmission pathways. After a full-text review to exclude these and focus on methodological approaches, 8 articles resulted which use Bayesian inference to recover transmission networks from multimodal data for infectious diseases, and which represent the topic of this review. This included Bayesian likelihood-based methods for integrating pathogen genomic information with temporal, spatial, and epidemiological characteristics for infectious diseases such as foot and mouth disease (FMD), and respiratory illnesses, including influenza. As incorporating genomic data simultaneously in analytical multimodal frameworks is a relatively novel idea, the literature on this is limited. Recent unified platforms have been made available to the community for analysis of outbreaks and storing of outbreak data [44]. Thus, it is essential to review available literature on this novel and burgeoning topic. For validation, we repeated our queries on Google Scholar. Although Google Scholar generated a much broader range of papers, based on the types of papers indexed, we verified that it also yielded the articles selected from PubMed. We are confident in our choice of articles for review as we have used two separate publications databases. Below we summarize the theoretical underpinnings of the likelihood-based framework approaches, inference parameters, and assumptions about each of these studies and articulate the limitations, which can motivate future research.",

Pathogen genomic data consisted of restriction-fragment-length polymorphism analysis of tuberculosis isolates.

[38] proposed a maximal spanning tree graph-based approach that went beyond existing phylogenetic methods. This method was utilized to uncover the spatiotemporal dynamics of the influenza A (H1N1) from 2009 and to study its worldwide spread. A total of 433 gene sequences of hemagglutinin (HA) and of neuraminidase (NA) were obtained from GenBank. Classical phylogenetic approaches fail to capture the hierarchical relationship between both ancestors and descendants sampled at the same time. Using their algorithm called SeqTrack [48], the authors constructed ancestries in samples based on a maximal-spanning tree. SeqTrack [38] utilizes the fact that in the absence of recombination and reverse mutations, strains will have unique ancestors characterized by the fewest possible mutations, no sample can be the ancestor of a sample which temporally preceded it, and the likelihood of ancestry can be estimated from the genomic differentiation between samples. SeqTrack was successful in reconstructing the transmission trees in both completely and incompletely sampled outbreaks unlike phylogenetic approaches, which failed to capture ancestral relationships between the tips of trees. However, this method cannot capture the underlying within-host virus genetic parameters. Moreover, mutations generated once can be present in different samples and transmission likelihood based on genetic distance may not be reliable.",

In this study, FMD virus genomes (the FMD virus has a positive strand RNA genome and it is a member of the genus \nAphthovirus\n in the family \nPicornaviridae) were collected from clinical samples from the infected farms. The samples were chosen so that they could be used to study variation within the outbreak and the time required for accumulation of genetic change, and to study transmission events. Total RNA was extracted directly from epithelial suspensions, blood, or esophageal suspensions. Sanger sequencing was performed on 42 overlapping amplicons covering the genome [53]. As the RNA virus has a high substitution rate, the number of mutations was sufficient to distinguish between different farms. They designed a maximum likelihood-based method incorporating complete genome sequences, date at which infection in a farm was identified, and the date of culling of the animals. The goal was to trace the transmission of FMD in Durham County, UK during the 2001 outbreak to infer the date of infection of animals and most likely period of their infectiousness. In their approach, they first generated the phylogenies of the viral genomes [54], [55]. Once the tip of the trees were generated, they constructed possible transmission trees by recursively working backwards to identify a most recent common ancestor (MRCA) in the form of a farm and assigned each haplotype to a farm. The likelihood of each tree was then estimated using epidemiological data. Their study included assumptions of the mean incubation time prior to being infectious to be five days, the distribution of incubation times to follow a discrete gamma distribution, the most likely date of infection to be the date of reporting minus the date of the oldest reported lesion of the farm minus the mean incubation time, and the farms to be a source of infection immediately after being identified as infected up to the day of culling. Spatial dependence in the transmission events was determined from the transmission tree by studying mean transmission distance. Their study indicated possible intermediate infected farms not inferred by the method and multiple introductions of pathogens in the area.",

This method was tested on an epidemic dataset of 241 poultry farms in an epidemic of avian influenza A (H7N7) in The Netherlands in 2003 consisting of geographical, genomic, and date of culling data. Consensus sequences of the HA, NA and polymerase PB2 genes were derived by pooling sequence data from five infected animals for 185 out of the 241 farms analyzed. The likelihood of one farm infecting another increased if the former was not culled at the time of infection of the latter, if they were in geographical proximity, or if the sampled pathogen genomic sequences were related. Their model included several assumptions such as non-correlation of genetic distance, time of infection, and geographical distance between host and target farms. The likelihood function was generated as follows: for the temporal component, a farm could infect another if its infection time was before the infection time of the target farm or if the infection time of the latter was between the infection and culling time of the former. If a farm was already culled, its infectiousness decayed exponentially. For the geographical component, two farms could infect each other with likelihood equal to the inverse of the distance between them. This likelihood varied according to a spatial kernel. For the genomic component, probabilities of transitions and transversions, and the presence or absence of a deletion was considered. If there was no missing data, the likelihood function was just a product of independent geographical, genomic, and temporal components. This method also allowed missing data by assuming that all the links to a specific missing data type are in one subtree. MCMC [52] was performed to sample all possible transmission trees and parameters. Marginalizing over a large number of subtrees over all possible values can also prove computationally expensive. Mutations were assumed to be fixed in the population before or after an infection, ignoring a molecular clock.",

The authors assumed that a premise or farm can be infected at a certain time followed by a latency period, a time period from infectiousness to detection, and a time of pathogen collection. This method utilized the FMD dataset from the study by Cottam et al. In order to simplify the posterior distribution further, latent variables denoting unobserved pathogens were removed and a pseudo-distribution incorporating the genetic distance between the observed and measured consensus sequences was generated. The posterior distribution corresponded to a pseudo-posterior distribution because the pathogens were sampled at observation time and not infection time. The genetic distance was measured by Hamming distance between sequences in isolation without considering the entire genetic network. Several assumptions including independence of latency time and infectiousness period were made. In determining the interval from the end-of-latency period to detection, the informative prior was centered on lesion age. This made this inference technique sensitive to veterinary estimates of lesion age. This study considered a single source of viral introduction in the population, which is feasible if the population size considered is small. This technique did not incorporate unobserved sources of infection and assumed all hosts were sampled. The authors also assumed that each host had the same probability of being infected.",

Their approach for generating the joint posterior probability of the transmission tree differed from existing methods in including the simultaneous estimation of the phylogenetic tree and within-host dynamics. The posterior probability distribution defined a sampling space consisting of the transmission tree, epidemiological parameters, and within-host dynamics which were inferred from the measured epidemiological data and the phylogenetic tree and mutation parameters which were inferred from the pathogen genomic data. The posterior probability distribution was estimated using the MCMC technique. The performance of the method was evaluated by measuring the probability assigned to actual transmission events. The assumptions made were that all infected hosts were observed, time of onset was known, sequences were sampled from a subpopulation of the infected hosts, and a single source/host introduced the infection in the population. In going beyond existing methods, the authors did not assume that events in the phylogenetic tree coincide with actual transmission events. A huge sampling fraction would be necessary to capture such microscale genetic diversity. This method works best when all infected hosts are observed and sampled.",

In this study, 13 genome sequences of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) were downloaded from GenBank and analyzed. Their method relies on pathogen genetic sequences and collection dates.

Unlike other existing studies, the authors took into account within-host evolution and did not assume that branches in phylogenetic trees correspond to actual transmission events. The generation time corresponds to the time between a host being infected and infecting others. For pathogens with short generation times, genetic diversity may not accrue to a very high degree and one can ignore within-host diversity. However, for diseases with high latency times and ones in which the host remains asymptomatic, there is scope for accumulation of considerable within-host genetic diversity. Their method used a timed phylogenetic tree from which a transmission tree is inferred on its own or can be combined with any available epidemiological support. Their simulations revealed that considering within-host pathogen generation intervals resulted in more realistic phylogenies between infector and infected. The method was tested on simulated datasets and with a real-world tuberculosis dataset with a known outbreak source with only genomic data and then modified using any available epidemiological data. The latter modified network resembled more the actual transmission activity in having a web-like layout and fewer bidirectional links. Their approach would work well for densely sampled outbreaks.",

Existing multi-modal frameworks are designed based on clinical data such as sequences collected from cases of influenza [35], [38] or veterinary assessment of FMD [24], [53], which generally represent the most severe cases with access to traditional healthcare institutions and automatically inherit considerable selection bias. Models to-date do not consider participatory surveillance data that has become increasingly available via mobile and Internet accessibility (e.g. data from web logs, search queries, Web survey-based participatory efforts such as GoViral with linked symptomatic, immunization, and molecular information [61] and online social networks and social network questionnaires). Another approach to improve the granularity of collected data could be community-generated data. These data can be fine-grained and can capture information on a wide range of cases from asymptomatic to mildly infectious to severe. This data can be utilized to incorporate additional transmission parameters of a community which can be more representative of disease transmission. As exemplified in Fig. 4a, community-generated data can be collected at the fine-grained spatial level of households, schools, workplaces, or zip codes and models must then also accommodate these spatial resolutions.",

Methods will have to handle missing data and unobserved and unsampled hosts to be applicable to realistic scenarios. In simpler cases, assumptions of single introductions of infection with single strains being passed between hosts may be adequate. However, robust frameworks will have to consider multiple introductions of pathogens in the host population with multiple circulating strains and co-infections in hosts. In order to be truly useful, frameworks have to address questions regarding rapid mutations of certain pathogens, phylogenetic uncertainty, recombination and reassortment, population stochastics, super spreading, exported cases, multiple introductions of pathogens in a population, within and between-host pathogen evolution, and phenotypic information. Methods will also need to scale up to advances in next-generation sequencing technology capable of producing large amounts of genomic data inexpensively [62], [63].",
