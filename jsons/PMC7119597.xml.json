A few years after the first outbreak, CPV-2 was completely replaced by two antigenic variants, termed CPV-2a and CPV-2b (Parrish et al., 1988). In 2000, a novel mutant of CPV, harboring an amino acid substitution at position 426 (CPV-2c), emerged in Italy and rapidly spread to several countries (Buonavoglia et al., 2001, Decaro and Buonavoglia, 2012). Infection by canine CPV results in a highly contagious enteric disease with a high rate of morbidity and mortality (Larson and Schultz, 2007, Parrish, 1990, Parrish, 1999).",

Conventional detection methods such as electron microscopy (Teramoto et al., 1984), virus isolation (Mochizuki et al., 1993), latex agglutination (Veijalainen et al., 1986), hemagglutination (Mochizuki et al., 1993, Teramoto et al., 1984), and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Drane et al., 1994, Teramoto et al., 1984) have been developed for the detection of CPV, and all are effective and accurate. Molecular detection techniques, including PCR (Mochizuki et al., 1993), real-time PCR (Decaro et al., 2005), nested PCR (Hirasawa et al., 1994), and loop-mediated isothermal amplification (Cho et al., 2006, Mukhopadhyay et al., 2012) have also been used to diagnose CPV, although the sensitivity and specificity of these techniques are variable; however, a major drawback is that these methods are both laborious and time-consuming. The key to preventing the spread of CPV is early and rapid diagnosis. Infected dogs can then be isolated and given supportive treatment to reduce both morbidity and mortality. Therefore, a rapid, on-site diagnostic method is required for the early detection of CPV.",

The piezoelectric effect is due to the electrical charge that accumulates in certain solid materials, such as crystals, in response to an applied mechanical stress. The QCM biosensor measures mass per unit area by measuring the change in the frequency of a quartz crystal resonator, and is a convenient method for detecting antigen-antibody interactions. The QCM biosensor is a \u201clabel-free technology\u201d because binding is detected directly without the need for labeled reagents. Many studies have used the QCM biosensor to detect pathogenic microorganisms such as Vibrio cholerae, Bacillus anthracis, malaria, Salmonella Typhimurium, Leishmania infantum, and canine influenza virus (Cabral-Miranda et al., 2014, Carter et al., 1995, Cooper et al., 2001, Hao et al., 2009, Ittarat et al., 2013, Kim et al., 2014, Salam et al., 2013).",

There were also 40 CPV-negative references, which comprised of 36 CPV-negative fecal samples, two bacterial (Escherichia coli and salmonella) and two viral (canine coronavirus and canine rotavirus) isolates. All of the CPV-positive and CPV-negative reference samples were confirmed as positive and negative by PCR, respectively. The field samples comprised 261 fecal samples taken from dogs with suspected CPV which were being treated at animal hospitals in Seoul and Gyeonggi province in South Korea from 2012 to 2013. DNA was extracted using a Qiagen DNA extraction kit (Hilden, Germany), according to manufacturer's instructions. All samples were identified as CPV-positive or -negative by PCR using the following CPV-specific primers: forward, 5\u2032-CAAATAGAGCATTGGGCTTACC-3\u2032 and reverse, 5\u2032-CAATCTCCTTCTGGATATCTTC-3\u2032. The PCR reaction mixture comprised 11 \u03bcL of DNase-free water, 5 \u03bcL of 5\u00d7 PCR buffer, 1 \u03bcL of each primer, 1 \u03bcL of dNTP mix, 1 \u03bcL of PCR enzyme mix, and 5 \u03bcL of extracted DNA as a template (total volume 25 \u03bcL). The PCR conditions were as follows: 94 \u00b0C for 5 min, followed by 35 cycles of 1 min at 94 \u00b0C, 1 min at 55 \u00b0C, and 1 min at 72 \u00b0C, with a final extension at 72 \u00b0C for 10 min.",

When measuring the frequency change that caused the antigen\u2013antibody interaction, it is important that the frequency is highly stabile and that background noise is kept to a minimum; this will ensure maximum sensitivity. Several factors may cause frequency drift, including the electrode surface and the viscosity of the liquid (Buttry and Ward, 1992, Tsionsky et al., 1995). Previous studies used silver and gold electrodes as QCM biosensors (Kim et al., 2014, Su et al., 2000); however, gold electrodes produce more consistent results because the surface is less rough than that of silver (Su et al., 2000). The roughness of the electrode surface is critical if frequency drift is to be minimized. Frequency drift is also associated with temperature (Rocklein and George, 2003, Martin et al., 1991, Wang et al., 2005). If the temperature fluctuates, both real mass changes over time and apparent mass changes must be measured concurrently; thus temperature-dependent apparent mass changes must be characterized and minimized to allow the QCM biosensor to provide an accurate readout of the frequency change (Rocklein and George, 2003). Over the last decade, the use of the QCM has been extended to the liquid phase (Bruckenstein et al., 1994). The resonance frequency of the crystal responds to the properties of a contacting liquid. Inconsistences in liquid viscosity are easily overcome by using PBS or water; thus the electrode surface, the temperature, and the viscosity of the liquid must all be taken into account if frequency drift is to be minimized.",

            "text": "If a QCM biosensor is to have both high sensitivity and specificity, important issues such as antibody orientation on the sensor surface must be resolved. There are two main approaches to preparing the surface on an antibody-based sensor: random antibody immobilization and site-directed antibody immobilization. The simplest technique is to allow random adsorption of the antibody onto the quartz surface. Although simple, this method has major drawbacks, including low stability and lower activity due to random orientation (Buijs et al., 1996, Makaraviciute and Ramanaviciene, 2013). Direct antibody immobilization via a self-assembled monolayer has multiple advantages, namely, that the technique is simple and the covalent bonding means that the surface is both stable and reusable; however, a major drawback is the relatively low sensitivity due to random antibody orientation and the low availability of antibody binding sites (Kausaite-Minkstimiene et al., 2010, Tsai and Pai, 2009). Therefore, site-directed antibody immobilization methods have been developed to address these short-comings (Della Ventura et al., 2011, Hussack et al., 2009, Kwon et al., 2004, Um et al., 2011, Yang et al., 2013, Yoon et al., 2011). A previous study showed that ProLinker\u2122 B, a calixcrown-5 derivative, is able to orient antibodies in a site-directed manner, leading to a more consistent position on the surface and a significant increase in sensitivity for the target antigen (Lee et al., 2003).",

The antigen\u2013antibody interaction is usually irreversible; however, the interaction can be disrupted by chaotropic reagents, organic solvents, or even ultrasonic radiation (Marazuela and Moreno-Bondi, 2002). ProLinker\u2122 B can easily be detached from quartz surfaces using piranha solution (Lee et al., 2003). The gold-coated quartz crystal described herein is reusable, which significantly reduces the cost of the QCM biosensors used to detect CPV.",
