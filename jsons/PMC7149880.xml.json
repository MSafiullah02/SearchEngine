Viruses were initially distinguished from other organisms by their small size and their ability to pass through filters. They were described as \u201cfilterable disease agents\u201d: in other words, infectious agents that are small enough to pass through bacterial filters. Since viruses are quintessential parasites that depend on a host for most of their sustaining functions, logic dictated that viruses also be defined and classified on the basis of the host they infect. However, the host range has proven to be a very complex biological phenomenon with intricacies that are yet to be fully understood. Additionally, not all viruses can be defined as strict parasites given the benefits derived from their association with certain hosts.",

            "text": "The recent discovery of giant viruses that infect protists and bacteria has initiated a major shift in the thinking on how to define and classify viruses. Indeed both the particle and genome sizes of these viruses overlap significantly with those of bacteria, some eukaryotes, and archaea. The discovery called for a definition of viruses based on their essential nature rather than on their size. To this end, one proposal called for the revision of the living world into two major groups of organisms, ribosome-encoding organisms that include all archaea, bacteria and eukarya, and capsid-encoding organisms, the viruses. Clearly, this division distinguishes viruses from cellular organisms based on genome content; in particular, the genes that encode ribosomal proteins and ribosomal RNAs. These genes are among the few genes whose sequences are conserved in all cellular organisms. The last universal common ancestor probably possessed a sophisticated ribosome that contained at least 34 ribosomal proteins that are shared by all archaeal, bacterial, and eukaryotic organisms. Unlike cellular organisms, viruses lack ribosomes and must use the ribosomes of their host cells for the translation of their mRNA into proteins.",

            "text": "While there is no single protein that is common to all viruses the expression of a capsid is a necessary structure that is used to disseminate viruses between ribosome-encoding hosts. One striking feature of viral capsids lies in the folded topology of the protein monomers that make up the capsid. The jellyroll \u03b2 barrel appears to be the most prevalent structural core motif among capsid proteins, but it has not been found in any cellular protein. However, numerous groups of viruses share a common evolutionary history with genetic elements that lack a capsid (and its coding gene) and are never encapsidated or, in some cases, encapsidated in the virions of \u201chost\u201d viruses. Hence another proposal that has been put forward is a scheme that does not focus on the presence of a capsid or any particular gene, but rather is rooted in the concept of genetic, informational parasitism. That is, viruses are parasitic genetic information; they possess a varied repertoire of replication strategies and establish a range of relationships with cellular hosts that exhibit various degrees of reliance on the information processing systems of the host. In this chapter we first examine the range of biological features of viruses. We later look at the taxonomic classification schemes for viruses, along with specific pitfalls. For a list of all recognized virus families and unassigned genera, the reader is referred to Table 2.1\n.",

In this form the capsid is made up of 60 replicas of the same protein(s) that interact spontaneously through template domains at their edges, resulting in an icosahedral structure. This is the simplest icosahedral capsid with a diameter of 20\u201325 nm. The capsid is composed of 12 pentameric capsomeres, i.e., a total of 60 capsomeres are required to complete the capsid. In larger viruses, more than 60 capsomeres are required to completely encapsidate the genome. The icosahedral capsid of the Rubella virus, e.g., is composed of 12 pentameric and 30 hexameric capsomeres for a total of 240 capsomeres. The diameter of these virions is in the range of 65\u201370 nm. Some viruses are easily recognizable by the unique arrangements of their capsomeres at the vertices of the icosahedron. For example, virions of members in the family Hepeviridae show a slightly lumpy daisy shape, those of Caliciviridae cup-like indentations, while those of Astroviridae display a remarkable star shape. Other viruses exhibit a multilayered protein capsid morphology, among these\nare species belonging to the family Reoviridae. Here, the capsids consist of 1\u20133 layers of protein surrounding the genome core of 9\u201312 dsRNA segments. Quite a few viruses also have fiber-like structures extending from their surfaces. Adenoviruses have long fibers emanating from its vertices, Sputnik-like virions (e.g., Adenoviridae) have short fibers stemming from every capsomer, and mimiviruses possess a forest of fibers. These virions that lack an envelope are referred to as naked or nonenveloped viruses.",

Arboviruses (viruses borne by arthropods like those belonging to the families Flaviviridae, Togaviridae, or Phenuiviridae, among others) present as fuzzy spheres possessing a peripheral fringe. HIV-1 carries prominent projections because of viral glycoprotein spikes that protrude from its envelope. The latter virus and other members of the Retroviridae are also described as pleomorphic. Pleomorphic viruses do not follow the rules of symmetry because the lipid envelope readily adopts different shapes and sizes, making each virion unique. Their virions are known to adopt spherical or polygonal structures. The influenza virion is an example. The virions generally take on an irregular shape or may appear spherical or elliptical in shape, ranging from approximately 80\u2013120 nm in diameter, and are occasionally filamentous, reaching more than 20 \u03bcm in length. Each copy of its eight genomic ssRNA (-) is folded into a rod-shaped, helical nucleocapsid complex referred to as ribonucleoprotein complex (RNP). Along with multiple copies of the viral-encoded nucleoprotein (NP), each RNP contains a heterotrimeric viral polymerase\n(consisting of PA, PB1, and PB2), and are themselves packaged in a lipid envelope that is derived from the host cell surface membrane.

The likely existence of capsid-less ancestors, along with the existence of capsid-less viruses today, suggests that the viral capsid was a late acquisition during their evolutionary history.

Viral-derived glycoproteins are embedded in the lipid bilayer and in some cases, other nonglycosylated proteins of viral origin form part of the envelope. The number of virus glycoproteins varies among viral groups; in members of the family Herpesviridae, e.g., more than 10 glycoproteins have been identified. In simplier cases (e.g., members of Togaviridae and Orthomyxoviridae), there are one or two multimeric proteins. Other viral-encoded glycoproteins are the ion channel proteins, viroporins. Viroporins have at least one transmembrane domain and sometimes an extracellular membrane region that interacts with viral or host proteins. Viroporins have been discovered in Influenza A virus, Hepacivirus C (previously known as Hepatitis C virus), Human immunodeficiency virus 1, and Coronaviruses. Enveloped viruses may also contain a layer of protein between the envelope and the capsid, known as the matrix (Orthomyxoviridae, Retroviridae), or there is no such layer and the capsid interacts directly with the internal tails of the membrane proteins (Togaviridae, Bunyavirales).",

            "text": "In 1971 the classification of viruses according to the genomic nature of viruses and method by which they replicate was proposed. It represented the easiest, and yet logical, way of grouping viruses. The central theme of the proposal, referred to as the Baltimore system of virus classification, is that all viruses must synthesize positive strand mRNAs from their genomes in order to produce proteins and replicate in their hosts. The proposal gave origin to six groups, and a seventh group was later added in order to accommodate the dsDNA-RT viruses (Caulimoviridae, of plant and animal hosts, and Hepadnaviridae of only animal hosts). The seven groups are as follows:Group I.dsDNA viruses, in which mRNAs are produced by direct transcription using a host RNA polymerase. These mRNAs can be produced from the genome of infecting virus (early mRNAs) or from progeny viral dsDNAs (late mRNAs). The dsDNA-RT viruses are not included in this group, but in group VII (see below).Group II.ssDNA viruses regardless of the genome polarity(ies) (+, \u2212, +/\u2212, and + plus \u2212) are included in this group since the production of the mRNAs involves the step of generating dsDNA first. In eukaryotes, virus replication occurs in the nucleus, most probably by a rolling circle mechanism.Group III.dsRNA viruses, as explained previously, produce mRNAs and replication templates by means of their own RdRP. This almost never occurs outside of the virus capsid.Group IV.ssRNA(+) viruses with genomes that are recognized immediately by the host cell machinery as mRNA. Translated proteins subsequently direct the replication of the viral genome. This messenger can be polycistronic, in which case the polyprotein resulting from translation is later cleaved by proteases encoded in the viral genome to give rise to functional viral proteins. In other cases, transcription is more complex and may involve the generation of subgenomic mRNAs, ribosomal (+ or \u2212) frameshifting or proteolytic processing of an initial precursor translation product. Retrotranscribing ssRNA(+) viruses are not included in this group, but in group VI (see later).Group V.ssRNA(\u2212) viruses that must be copied first into a sense RNA molecule in order to produce viral mRNAs. There are two main types of ssRNA(\u2212) depending on where virus replication occurs: those that replicate in the cytoplasm are monopartite and are transcribed by the RdRp to produce the sense molecule that can be translated and serve also as the template for the generation of the minus strand (genomic molecule). And those with segmented genomes that are replicated in the nucleus, in which case separate mRNAs are produced by the viral RdRp resulting in both messenger and replication template molecules. ssRNA(+/\u2212) viruses are also included in this group.Group VI.ssRNA(+)-RT viruses that, by means of a virus-encoded reverse transcriptase (RT), generate a dsDNA copy of the genomic molecule. This dsDNA molecule is integrated into the genome of the host (becoming a provirus) where it can be replicated and transcribed in the nucleus using the host cell\u2019s machinery to provide viral mRNAs as well as ssRNA(+) genomic molecules.Group VII.dsDNA-RT viruses that possess a gapped genome (open circular, OC, dsDNA genome) that upon infection is filled to generate a Covalently Closed Circular (CCC) form. Transcription of the CCC genome in the nucleus generates viral mRNAs and a subgenomic RNA. Using a virus-encoded RT, the subgenomic RNA is converted to the genomic OC dsDNA molecule.\n",

The virion provides much information toward the characterization of viruses and the way they interact with cellular organisms, but should not be the main emphasis in distinguishing viruses. For one thing, virion morphology in different groups may be the result of convergent evolution. That is, there is no evolutionary relatedness involved, nor shared ancestry. The demonstration of chimerism in virus genomes also adds to the unreliable use of morphology when trying to analyze virus evolution and classification since we would be comparing features of different origins (replicase and capsid proteins, for example) in the same subject of study. Importantly also is the fact that not all viruses produce virions, as explained. Virion morphology, however, is still a very useful way to characterize (and even identify) viruses since the expression of their molecular features are identifiable and measurable, and derive directly from the information the virus encodes.",

In other words the goal of taxonomy is to categorize the multitude of known viruses so as to maximize organization, stability, and predictivity. The first goal, probably the most basic, is easily attainable given that the rules of classification are clear and followed by all. That is, the vast diversity of viruses is organized by grouping all similar viruses that share the same denomination and, for the most part, established evolutionary relationships. If this preliminary classification is based on solid grounds, stability ensues. Nonetheless, taxonomy cannot be a static, never-changing tool for virologists. As our realization of viral diversity widens and new technologies become available, virus taxonomy has to be flexible enough to accommodate occasional revisions and reinterpretation of perceived relationships between viruses. As for predictability, this is more complex and challenging; i.e., being able to speculate on the characteristics of near relatives of known species.

Rapid advances in metagenomics have revealed a virosphere that is more phylogenetically and genomically diverse than that depicted in the current classification scheme. Indeed a number of studies have generated large sequence datasets of viral metagenomic sequences that cannot readily be classified using conventional criteria since these are based on phenotypic properties as well as genetic relationships. Classification based on sequence comparisons alone represents a pragmatic solution to the problem of classifying viral metagenomic sequences, but is a significant departure from current methods for classifying viruses. Viral metagenomic sequences may have sufficient defining characteristics to enable their classification as additional taxa in existing virus families and may even be used to justify the creation of new virus families. Further information on diversity and clustering may, however, be required to justify the formation of genera and species ranks within the family. Perhaps though, a reevaluation of the concept of viral species, genera, families, and higher levels of classification is needed; particularly a consensus on which diagnostic properties are the most useful for identifying individual members of a virus species. Just as microbiologists discarded dubious morphological traits in favor of more accurate molecular yardsticks of evolutionary change, virologists can gain new insight into viral evolution through the rigorous analyzes afforded by the molecular phylogenetics of viral genes, which are essential for the classification of viruses below the family taxon level. On the other hand, others have gone as far as suggesting a new division of biological entities into two classes of organisms: ribosome-encoding organisms that include all archaea, bacteria and eukarya, and capsid-encoding organisms, the viruses. Doubts have been raised on the suitability of relying only on the capsid structure for resolving phylogenetic uncertainties. Some argue that a more integrated account of all three categories of containment, replication, and reliance on the information processing systems of the host, recognizes the origin and evolution of viruses. The last point is worth emphasizing; evolutionary processes have shaped the genetic structure and diversity of viruses and the viruses themselves have influenced the evolution of cellular organisms in all domains of life.",
