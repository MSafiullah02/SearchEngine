Along with rapid adoption as a tool for functional genomics, expanding studies on RNAi itself have greatly enhanced our understanding of this endogenous gene inhibition process since discovery that posttranscriptional gene silencing (PTGS) in plants is also active in animal cells. Despite rapidly expanding studies, RNAi biology is still far from being well understood. A major challenge is the growing appreciation that the RNAi system is involved in several endogenous activities with differing roles.",

For such a response to be effective, strong and selective gene inhibition is important. This gene inhibition function operates through an active intermediate that is short fragments of the dsRNA genome, now called short interfering RNA (siRNA), as shown in Fig. 6.1\n. The RNAi antiviral response generally is accompanied by interferon and other events induced by recognition of the dsRNA viral genome. An important finding has been that introduction of siRNA with sequences matching endogenous genes, instead of invading virus genomes, leads to activation of the RNAi system and inhibition of that endogenous gene. Importantly, studies have shown that introduction of these artificial siRNA usually avoids the interferon and other concomitant biological responses (McManus and Sharp, 2002). Also, the RNAi machinery has been found to perform its function in the cytoplasmic compartment, reducing the hurdles for intracellular siRNA delivery compared to gene therapy requirements for delivery to the nucleus.",

This function operates, at least in part, through an active intermediate that is a short expressed RNA with an imperfect palindrome sequence, now called microinterfering RNA (miRNA). The palindrome sequence forms an imperfect dsRNA segment with a loop of single\u2010stranded (ss) RNA at one end, or a hairpin type of structure, mimicked by expressed short hairpin RNA (shRNA).

Consequently, it is not surprising that different RNAi processes have very similar mechanisms of action and share machinery. The shared machinery may aid efforts to harness RNAi for our own purposes by allowing greater utility of the techniques developed. However, with versatility comes complexity and increased risk of inducing unwanted or unexpected RNAi activities. Ultimately, though, what makes the RNAi system so attractive is its fundamental capabilities to achieve very strong inhibition of specific genes, and with striking selectivity. This is clearly essential for biological systems to regulate themselves. It is also the goal of targeted therapeutic strategies, driven by realization that the most successful drugs act through inhibition of specific target proteins. A number of studies have evaluated the extent of gene inhibition specificity achieved with siRNA, in most cases indicating selectivity but not an absolute selectivity (Chi 2003, Jackson 2003, Kariko 2004, Semizarov 2003, Sledz 2003). In fact, it can be difficult to distinguish between an off\u2010target effect on the wrong gene and downstream biological consequences from RNAi silenced genes. An important aspect that has yet to be addressed is the relative selectivity by siRNA versus other gene sequence\u2010based methods for inhibiting gene expression, i.e., antisense. Nonetheless, while off\u2010target effects have been observed, the most common outcome is a finding of substantial siRNA gene selectivity. Thus the use of appropriate controls is important.",

This feature has fueled a rapid adoption of RNAi for biology research through the design of siRNA with a sequence matching genes of interest. The siRNA oligonucleotides were originally identified as short dsRNA fragments generated by RNAi machinery called Dicer that processes long dsRNA, such as from a viral infection, into siRNA fragments. These siRNA were found to be an active intermediate used a second piece of the machinery, called RISC, to select mRNA for degradation, as described elsewhere (Bantounas 2004, Lu 2003a, McManus 2002). The mechanism for miRNA appears to be similar but not identical to that of siRNA. One similarity is that the miRNA also appear to invoke some of the same RISC components and degrade the homologous mRNA before ribosomal translation can occur. The endogenous activity of RNAi to regulate endogenous gene expression, which clearly depends on both good specificity and strong inhibition, may explain its robust potency and selectivity. But while the nature of RNAi remains an area of active investigation, the use of short dsRNA sequences is proving to be an extremely robust and effective method to inhibit specific genes of interest, simply, and depending largely on the identification of unique sequences for that gene or splice variant (Fig. 6.1).",

The latter has led to considerable adoption of siRNA for functional genomics looking for inhibition of genes that can generate therapeutic benefits reversing pathological effects, often caused by overexpression of those same genes. However, the approach clearly depends on the effectiveness of siRNA delivery to modulate, very selectively, the expression of specific genes and, as a result, to induce physiological or pharmacological effects. A key requirement is identification of an effective site in the target mRNA sequence for siRNA accessibility. Also, for most applications, effective transfection of the siRNA agent into the cytoplasmic compartment is critical (Bantounas 2004, McManus 2002).",

However, research in many different therapeutic areas is invoking application of siRNA for use as a research tool for the validation of gene functions (Xie et al., 2004). Regardless of therapeutic area, the success of in vitro transfection of siRNA into cells for target research has led to a strong interest in extending those studies to in vivo systems. However, in vivo delivery of siRNA into specific tissues of animal disease is much more complicated. Although increasing numbers of studies on target identification and validation using siRNA in vitro have been reported, limited reports of in vivo studies have indicated a lack of effective delivery methods for siRNA agents. The key to in vivo application is a delivery system that transports the siRNA into the target tissue and into the cell cytoplasm, or shRNA expression cassette to the nucleus much like the dependence of gene therapy on appropriate delivery methods. Given the extensive efforts in nucleic acid delivery for gene therapy, many delivery tools can be considered for siRNA or shRNA delivery, including biological\u2010based vectors and synthetic chemical\u2010 and physical\u2010based systems.",

An initial challenge for this approach was the difficulty of getting expression of two short complementary RNA oligonucleotides within the cell to result in their hybridization to yield the dsRNA oligonucleotide. One solution to this problem is expressing a single RNA with a palindromic sequence so that it can hybridize with itself and form a stem\u2013loop \u201chairpin\u201d structure much like miRNA, now called short hairpin RNA (shRNA). Theoretically, such expression cassettes can be introduced by any of the standard gene delivery systems, including viral and non\u2010viral methods. A growing number of efforts are being reported for the construction of such systems and evaluation for in vivo application (Davidson 2004, Devroe 2002, Kobayashi 2004, Pardridge 2004, Tiscornia 2003, Xia 2002) However, the time and effort needed to construct such expression cassettes and incorporate them into delivery systems add considerably to the time and cost to set up a study for a gene of interest. This is particularly true when it is realized that several sequences must be tested to find an effective sequence. Unfortunately, identification of active sequences using synthetic siRNA oligonucleotides is not always predictive of active shRNA sequences, reducing the utility of preliminary siRNA screens to address this problem. Once an effective expression cassette is identified, the materials usually can be replenished through standard molecular biology techniques.",

Lumped together in this poorly defined class are many different systems covering vastly different forms of nucleic acid. Likewise, this class covers a wide variety of methods to formulate and deliver the nucleic acid to enable intracellular delivery, including cationic complexes with lipids, polymers, or both, PLGA microsphere depot formulations, hydrophilic protective polymers, physical force\u2010based delivery such as bombardment with nucleic acid\u2010coated gold particles or electroporation, and many other delivery methods. Note that a common feature conveyed by the non\u2010viral category is their operability with either natural or synthetic forms of the nucleic acid, e.g., from plasmids to phosphorothioate antisense oligonucleotides. In addition, the success of each for delivery in vivo depends on many factors, such as route and tissue uptake. The greatest success has been attained for local delivery to tissues, e.g., PLGA microspheres and electroporation for muscle delivery. Only a few successes have been attained for systemic delivery such as high\u2010pressure tail vein administration or \u201chydrodynamic\u201d delivery for liver hepatocytes and the DOTAP lipoplex for lung tissues. Some of these delivery methods have limited potential application in humans, e.g., hydrodynamic delivery, but their capabilities can be enabling for functional genomics research investigations in vivo, where the criteria for success are very different (Lu et al., 2003).",

The most commonly used transfection reagents have been cationic lipids, producing lipoplex complexes (Spagnou et al., 2004). Sorensen et al. (2003) examined delivery with cationic liposome\u2010based administration in mice of siRNAs combined with a matching plasmid encoding the green fluorescent protein (GFP) and found inhibition in vivo of the GFP plasmid gene expression. Furthermore, the studies evaluated the intraperitoneal injection of anti\u2010TNF\u2010\u03b1 siRNA inhibited lipopolysaccharide\u2010induced tumor necrosis factor\u2010\u03b1 (TNF\u2010\u03b1) gene expression, whereas secretion of interleukin (IL)1\u2010\u03b1 was not inhibited. As found in gene therapy efforts, development of non\u2010viral delivery methods that achieve tumor\u2010targeted siRNA delivery and activity from an intravenous administration has proven to be difficult. One study reported use of a cationic chemical derivative of cardiolipin to form lipoplexes with siRNA targeting the cRAF (also known as RAF\u20101) oncogene that inhibited tumor growth in a sequence\u2010specific manner but the study neglected to evaluate whether the target gene was specifically inhibited (Chien et al., 2004). This confirmation of target inhibition can help reveal effects that cannot be attributed to an RNAi mechanism as found in earlier studies using an aqueous administration of siRNA (Filleur et al., 2003).",

Studies have begun to emerge for adaptation of these systems for siRNA (Kakizawa 2004, Khan 2004, Schiffelers 2004b). Results obtained using ligand targeting of plasmids to tumor neovasculature suggest that systemic tumor therapeutics using gene delivery is a possibility (Hood 2002, Ogris 2003, Walker 2005, Woodle 2001), but this approach focuses on delivery to endothelial cells of the tumor blood vessels. The efficiency of plasmid expression is also limited, as trafficking to the nucleus is thought to be inadequate. For siRNA, its activity in the cytoplasm reduces the challenge. Results have been published using systemic administration of a targeted nanoplex using an Arg\u2010Gly\u2010Asp (RGD) motif peptide ligand that combines selective localization at neovasculature with delivery of siRNA inhibiting the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) pathway gene expression driving angiogenesis whether in tumors or eye disease (Kim 2004, Schiffelers 2004b). Importantly, in both studies, results showed siRNA sequence\u2010specific target gene inhibition in the pathological tissue. Such systems introducing dual targeting offer the promise of increasing selectivity in targeted therapeutic development. These advances in cationic complexes forming layered nanoparticles appear promising for the therapeutic application of siRNA for metastatic cancer and many other angiogenesis\u2010related diseases.",

For example, immunogenicity of viral vectors has precluded multiple administrations and resulted in severe toxicity limitations. Chromosomal integration, and the resulting safety concerns, is also avoided by non\u2010viral vectors. While potential safety issues are not a limitation for functional genomics, immunogenicity and other side effects can obscure the results and need to be avoided. Clearly, effective siRNA delivery is crucial for in vivo functional genomics, i.e., inhibition of gene expression in a significant number of cells as a means to emulate the biological effect of a drug targeting the same protein can be emulated. This means that the siRNA needs to be delivered to approximately the same percentage of the same cells and the cells in the same tissue as will be affected by the candidate drug. As mentioned for viral vectors, an equally important requirement for non\u2010viral vectors is delivery without significant background activity from the delivery method itself. Non\u2010viral delivery methods tend to have much lower levels of biological effects, other than that from the gene, relative to viral vectors with their many protein components.",

These clinical delivery approaches appear suitable for siRNA administration but depend on local administration. Using a model of retinal neovascularization induced by laser damage, Reich and colleagues (2003) delivered nonformulated siRNA specific to murine VEGF to the subretinal space and observed significant reduction of eye angiogenesis. Importantly, unlike antisense or RNA aptamers, this work indicated that chemical protection of the siRNA was not essential, at least in the intravitreal compartment of the eye. Using a different murine model, one for herpetic stromal ketatitis, which develops from herpes simplex virus infection, the laboratory of Barry Rouse also reported the use of polyplexes for local administration of siRNA to inhibit the VEGF pathway (Kim et al., 2004). This work compared local with systemic targeted delivery, as discussed later. It now seems clear that local ocular delivery of siRNA, through different routes with different formulations, can be used to inhibit genes sufficiently for gene function studies. The work also provides strong support for the therapeutic application of siRNA for ocular disease, especially ocular neovascularization.",

Initial efforts for brain delivery focused on expressed RNAi constructs (Davidson and Paulson, 2004), but Dorn et al. (2004) evaluated the infusion of aqueous solutions of chemically protected siRNA oligonucleotides directly into the brain and found that selective gene inhibition could be obtained. However, the special nature of the latter method, including specialized chemical modifications of the siRNA and surgically implanted infusion pumps delivering high doses, limits its usefulness for many laboratories interested in this area. Other studies on the use of cationic formulations for the delivery of siRNA to brain found that delivery was more effective with the tested lipoplex than with the tested polyplex (Hassani et al., 2004). The success observed in these diverse studies shows the promise of siRNA delivery to brain tissues for functional genomics and, in the long term, good potential for therapeutic applications.",

In fact, local administration of aqueous siRNA into tumors was found less effective than a distal systemic administration on an endogenous reporter gene (Filleur et al., 2003). In that study, effects observed from distal administration were not attributable to an RNAi activity and the authors concluded that tumor delivery was inadequate.

Thus the key to using siRNA sequences directed to any gene target implicated in rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases is effective local delivery enabling intracellular delivery of siRNA agents at the diseased site and, more specifically, the specific cellular components of the disease pathology (Rutz and Scheffold, 2004). Direct injection of siRNA molecules has been reported by hydrodynamic pressure in isolated limbs (Hagstrom et al., 2004) or formulated with cationic lipids or polymers can be considered for local delivery, but tend to induce inflammation, which is contraindicated for arthritic disease studies. Also, for plasmid delivery to skeletal muscle, eletroporation has proven the most robust method and recently applied to siRNA delivery, (Golzio et al., 2004). The extension of this method to inflamed joints in an arthritis model has shown promise as a method for functional genomic studies (Schiffelers et al., 2005), but clinical application of this approach has yet to be described. Ultimately, the biology of the inflammation and immune response, which is central to the rheumatic arthritic diseases, may benefit from cell targeting. To that end, the use of ligand\u2010targeted nanoparticles, even with local intraarticular injection, is attractive as a potential means to achieve gene inhibition without exacerbating the pathological phenotype by the delivery system itself.",

            "text": "Some of the first published results showing activity of siRNA in mammals accomplished that feat by delivery into mouse liver. This was achieved using hydrodynamic delivery, a rapid injection of a large volume of aqueous solution into the mouse tail vein creating high pressure in the vascular circulation that leads to extensive delivery into hepatocytes (Lewis 2002, McCaffrey 2002, Song 2003, Zender 2003). Studies using hydrodynamic administration also found poor activity of aqueous siRNA when given by traditional intravenous administration, even when chemically stabilized siRNA were used (Layzer et al., 2004), unlike earlier findings with antisense oligonucleotides. These studies showed that siRNA not only can inhibit exogenous plasmid expression, but also endogenous hepatocyte gene expression. The success implies that delivery of siRNA to the liver results in uptake by a majority of hepatocytes, as found for plasmid delivery. Interestingly, recent studies found that aqueous administration of siRNA didn't induce a non\u2010specific interferon response (Heidel et al., 2004). The hydrodynamic administration procedure allows the use of siRNA in mice for gene function and drug target validation studies (Sen 2003, Zender 2003), but is limited largely to research on liver function and metabolism or liver infectious diseases such as hepatitis. Although this particular method is not clinically feasible for human patients, it is an effective approach for gene function validation. Song et al. (2003) injected Fas siRNA and achieved down\u2010regulation of both Fas mRNA and Fas protein in mouse hepatocytes, and the effects persisted without diminution for 10 days. Zender and colleagues (2003) delivered 21 nucleotide siRNAs against caspase 8, resulting in inhibition of caspase 8 gene expression in the liver, thereby preventing Fas (CD95)\u2010mediated apoptosis. Giladi and colleagues (2004) used hydrodynamic delivery of siRNA to inhibit levels of hepatitis B viral transcripts, viral antigens, and viral DNA in liver and sera. Adenovirus has also been applied for liver delivery of expressed RNAi methods but mainly offers an orthogonal delivery approach to confirm that findings are due to gene inhibition and not specific to the delivery method. Although both hydrodynamic delivery and adenoviral vector are not clinically acceptable methods, these two systems have a relatively high hepatocyte efficiency, which is a very powerful tool for hepatocyte functional genomic studies.",

One alternative method for liver\u2010targeted delivery of siRNA is to use chemical modification of the oligonucleotide, as suggested by work with cholesterol conjugates (Soutschek et al., 2004). However, this work shows that at least three challenges must be addressed: adequate protection of the siRNA oligonucleotide from biological degradation en route to the liver, protection of the siRNA oligonucleotide from rapid glomerfiltration by the kidney into the urine (actually this is more important than stabilization), and selective uptake by the target hepatocytes. The use of cholesterol conjugates was found to require very high doses, suggesting that the distribution was widespread rather than liver targeted. Further efforts to attain liver targeted siRNA are warranted.",

Their unpredictable and uncontrolled growth makes malignant cancer the most dangerous and fatal form of cancer. Metastatic tumors established at distant locations usually are not encapsulated and thus are more amenable for systemic delivery. Therefore, local delivery of siRNA or any therapeutic agent is limited to a few tumor types, such as head\u2010and\u2010neck cancer and melanoma. For functional genomics, local administration methods (as discussed earlier) can meet the requirements for most studies by acting on primary tumors, even in xenograft models, which form the basis of most cancer biology research.

            "text": "Systemic delivery imposes several requirements and greater hurdles than local delivery. For siRNA, it must provide increased oligonucleotide stability in the blood and in the local environment before it enters the target cells. In addition, it often requires the siRNA to pass through multiple tissue barriers to reach the target cell and may benefit from protection from loss of activity once within the target cells. Sorenson et al. (2003) described the use of lipoplex gene delivery systems for the systemic delivery of siRNA, attaining a strong lung delivery as found when plasmid DNA is used. Other work with siRNA lipoplexes formed with a cardiolipid analogue showed phenotypic effects on tumor growth but lack confirmation of an RNAi activity at the tumor and suggest that much of the distribution is to the lung as expected from a lipoplex. An emergence of targeted nanoparticle systems, initially for plasmids or DNA oligonucleotides for cancer, is much more promising (Hood 2002, Pun 2004, Woodle 2001). The nature of these systems to protect and deliver isolated DNA suggests that they can be adapted for siRNA oligonucleotides. Results support this conclusion using an RGD peptide ligand\u2010directed nanoparticle for antiangiogenic treatment for cancer (Dubey et al., 2004) by systemic siRNA delivery (Schiffelers et al., 2004b). These results provide growing support for the development of systemic siRNA treatments for cancer, with a growing proof of concept for antiangiogenic modalities as reviewed elsewhere (Lu et al., 2005). The RGD ligand\u2010targeted nanoparticle for targeting neovasculature has also been studied in ocular neovascularization models (Kim et al., 2004). The results further strengthen the support for this approach as a clinically feasible method for siRNA therapeutics. They also provided a demonstration that siRNA for several genes can be combined in the same nanoparticle to give a better inhibition of disease pathology.",

            "text": "In cancer, the tumorigenesis process is thought to be the result of an abnormal overexpression of oncogenes, growth factors, and mutant tumor suppressors, even though underexpression of other proteins also plays critical roles. Efforts to identify and validate tumorigenic targets have been focused mainly on those targets overexpressed in the tumor tissues and promoting tumorigenesis as a means to enable development of small molecule and antibody anticancer drugs acting through an inhibitor mechanism. There are rapidly increasing numbers of reports demonstrating that siRNA and shRNA are able to knockdown tumorigenic genes in vitro, with emerging reports for in vivo (Lu 2003b, Xie 2004). Studies designed to reveal whether a gene target plays a tumorigenic role use siRNA duplexes specifically targeting its mRNA sequence to knock down its expression and then observing whether the effect on pathology is a direct and specific effect. One method has been described for a unique target identification approach (Lu et al., 2003a) named Efficacy\u2010First discovery. This method utilizes efficient nucleic acid delivery into xenograft tumors to induce phenotypic effects on tumor growth rate as a method to verify or validate candidate genes for a controlling role in tumor growth behaviors. Using these methods, a pool of gene targets was identified for changes in expression that correlated with changes in tumor growth rate, i.e., their expression correlated with efficacy. Among the well\u2010known cancer cell growth factors, VEGF and VEGF R2 represent two of the most widely recognized and highly validated targets. In these studies, siRNA\u2010mediated downregulation of these endogenous genes in clinically relevant animal models was used as part of a functional genomics study in cancer (Lu et al., 2003a). Marked tumor growth inhibition was observed following repeated delivery of the siRNAs specific to hVEGF and mVEGFR2, which accompanied knockdown of the growth factor at both mRNA and protein levels. The results illustrate the feasibility of using siRNA delivery in animal tumor models for drug target validation according to its ability to achieve efficacy (Lu et al., 2003a). This in vivo delivery of siRNA enables differentiation of genes to find out which play a disease\u2010controlling role in tumor growth. This validation process, called disease\u2010control validation, is based on tumor efficacy by siRNA in vivo and with clinically relevant xenograft tumor models to give a clear indication of the importance of specific proteins as a drug target (Lu et al., 2003a).",

To be effective, in vivo functional genomics requires high efficiency in vivo delivery and good activity in a clinically relevant disease model for the clinical indication of interest. Results obtained to date indicate that the gene inhibition of siRNA is not only a sequence\u2010specific effect, but is also sustainable and obtainable with relatively few side effects (low noise level). Importantly, this approach offers an ability to gain insight into the genes and proteins associated with the later stages of pathology, as it can be applied to established disease tissues. Such capabilities to move rapidly from cell culture into clinically relevant disease models promise to revolutionize the speed with which drug targets can be identified and validated for drug discovery. Equally important, the use of siRNA in vivo offers the prospects for rapidly obtaining a better understanding of how a particular target can be used to achieve a clinically meaningful therapeutic intervention in disease. This capability is also important for basic research into disease biology, since selective gene inhibition tools and ones that can be constructed quickly and that can operate in animal models will facilitate the rapid expansion of our knowledge. Thus the emerging capability of in vivo delivery of siRNA is greatly expanding its power as a tool for functional genomics.",

            "text": "Surprisingly, in vivo stability has not proven to be the major rate\u2010limiting barrier, even for intravenous administration. In fact, rapid excretion of siRNA from blood into the urine occurs before degradation. Nonetheless, efforts are underway to increase its biological stability, primarily via medicinal chemistry originally developed for oligonucleotides. However, chemical stabilization does not address key requirements for better pharmacokinetics and tissue distribution. With conjugation of lipophilic residues to increase serum protein binding, improved pharmacokinetics of the oligonucleotide, alteration of its biodistribution, and reduced urinary excretion were observed (Soutschek et al., 2004). Ultimately, such chemical modification must also address requirements for entering targeted cells, overcoming endosomal and other intracellular barriers, and retaining activity with the cellular RNAi machinery. A different approach to solving these problems using ligand\u2010targeted nanoparticles (Kim 2004, Pardridge 2004, Schiffelers 2004b) is showing good activity even without chemical stabilization. The fundamental thinking behind this approach is that RNA interference is a natural process involving a complicated cellular mechanism where siRNA is the predominant intermediate playing a sequence\u2010specific silencing function. Therefore, preserving the biochemical authenticity of siRNA and improving its in vivo delivery efficiency with nanoparticle or other formulations will have the best chance for success in therapeutic application, and, importantly, the best chance to reduce unwanted side effects. Although local and topical delivery of siRNA may fit well for certain disease applications, the systemic delivery of siRNA will have much broader therapeutic applications. The ideal system for siRNA systemic delivery should be a nanoparticle with ligand\u2010directed tissue localization (Fig. 6.3\n). This three\u2010stage system should be able to first protect the siRNA duplex from excretion and degradation in body fluid such as blood and, at the same time, avoid aggregation and nonspecific binding of the nanoparticles. The system should also have targeting capability to reach disease tissue specifically. When the particle binds and enters the targeted cells, the siRNA content should be released for action. When the siRNA specifically inhibits expression of a disease\u2010causing gene and protein, the clinical benefit will be achieved. As described earlier, a layered nanoplex system has been described that combines neovasculature\u2010targeted nanoparticles giving cytoplasmic delivery with highly potent siRNA active in the cytoplasm. This nanoparticle system appears promising for the therapeutic application of siRNA for metastatic cancer and many other angiogenesis related diseases. The modular design of this nanoparticle should permit incorporation of other ligands applicable for siRNA delivery for other diseases.",

This is one aspect of siRNA that offers considerable promise relative to the current set of targeted therapeutics such as antibodies. Considerable evidence shows that many types of human diseases result from overexpression of multiple disease\u2010causing genes. Thus the potent and specific properties of siRNA that are controlled solely by changes to their sequence suggest that their combinations will be easily managed. Kim et al. (2004) showed the facility with which siRNA can provide combination therapeutics (an siRNA oligo cocktail) targeting multiple genes in the pathology to achieve much better therapeutic efficacy. This approach is based on two important facts: although inhibitory siRNA duplexes are sequence specific, all of them use an identical chemistry (dsRNA oligonucleotides); however, many human diseases are the result of overexpression of multiple endogenous and exogenous disease\u2010causing genes. Using an siRNA oligo cocktail targeting multiple disease\u2010causing genes represents an advantageous therapeutic approach with a synergistic effect. Nevertheless, even as a single agent, siRNA has tremendous therapeutic potential that will be realized when clinically feasible deliveries are developed.",
