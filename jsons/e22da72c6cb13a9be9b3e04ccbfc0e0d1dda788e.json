For example, infection by a hemoplasma species is thought to be one of the most common causes of anemia in cats and the majority of the samples assessed in this study were suspected to have hemoplasmosis by the referring veterinarian as evidenced by the submission for hemoplasma testing. However, hemoplasma DNA was amplified from only 20.2% of the cats with anemia and there was no significant difference in hemoplasma prevalence rates between healthy and anemic cats, regardless of flea risk. While both hemoplasmas are associated with anemia in some cats, not all infected cats develop anemia, most infected cats survive regardless of antibiotic treatment, and infection can persist for months in cats with or without antibiotic therapy (Tasker and Lappin 2002) . These facts probably explain our failure to detect differences in prevalence rates between cats with anemia and healthy cats. However, the fact that a historical control group was used in this study versus an age-matched sample drawn from a healthy cat on the same day from the same clinic as anemic samples might also account for the lack of a difference. In addition, these results also document that amplification of hemoplasma DNA from the blood of a cat does not directly prove the anemia was a result of the infection. Failure to document hemoplasma infection in 79.8% of suspect cases supports our hypothesis that other causes of anemia in cats exist and may be common. In future studies, PCR assays that amplify C felis, Babesia species, and 'Candidatus M turicensis' should also be used. Because Bartonella species can reside within erythrocytes of cats Breitschwerdt 1995, Guptill 2005 ) and because some Bartonella species of people and dogs have been associated with hemolytic anemia (Spach and Koehler 1998 , Van Audenhove et al 2001 , we hypothesized that Bartonella species infection may be a differential diagnosis for cats with unexplained anemia. However, results of this study fail to link Bartonella species to presence of anemia, regardless of flea risk. In a separate study of sick cats in North Carolina, cats with B henselae antibodies in their serum were no more likely to be anemic than cats that were B henselae seronegative (Breitschwerdt et al 2005) . We believe that the results of these two studies suggest B henselae and B clarridgeiae are not common causes of anemia in cats. There are several potential limitations to prevalence studies based on PCR assay results. While the primers utilized in this study occasionally amplify non-Bartonella species DNA, all amplicons detected in this study were of the appropriate size and so we do not believe false positive results occurred (Maggi and Breitschwerdt 2005a) . As mentioned, if antibiotics had been previously administered and not recorded in the medical record, some cases may have had falsely negative results. In addition, while PCR assays are very sensitive, blood culture is still considered the most sensitive and specific test to prove Bartonella species bacteremia (Guptill 2005 , Maggi et al 2005b .
