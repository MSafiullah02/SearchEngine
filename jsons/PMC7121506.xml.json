The three diazine isomers are pyridazine (1,2-diazine), pyrimidine (1,3-diazine) and pyrazine (1,4-diazine). The most important naturally occurring diazines are the pyrimidine bases uracil, thymine, and cytosine, which comprise the fundamental nucleoside building blocks in deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic acid (RNA). Pyrazines occur frequently as constituents in foodstuffs and are responsible for their flavor and strong aroma. Although being present in very small amounts, they are highly odiferous and can be detected at extremely low concentrations. Unlike other heterocycles found in many important natural products, pyridazines were discovered only after 1970, and relatively few pyridazines have thus far been isolated from natural sources. As synthetic compounds, all diazines constitute an important pharmacophoric moiety present in many drugs acting on various pharmacological targets as well as agrochemicals.",

One of the earliest synthetic fluorinated drugs is the antineoplastic agent 5-fluorouracil, derivative of pyrimidine, an antimetabolite first synthesised in 1957. Since the advent of 5-fluorouracil, fluorine substitution is commonly used in contemporary medicinal and agrochemistry to improve metabolic stability, bioavailability and protein\u2013ligand interactions. In this review only compound bearing fluoro or fluoroalkyl substituent in diazine ring are discussed. Among fluorine containing diazines now 12 drugs and 10 agrochemicals are presented on the market. This review provides an information about fluorinated diazines as drugs or agrochemicals and their mode of action as well as synthesis. The review is divided in two parts. First part dedicated to the medicinal and synthetic chemistry of fluorinated diazines that have reached at least clinical development phase. The second one dedicated to the biological role and the chemistry of the marketed agrochemicals based on fluorinated diazines.",

In this view, fluorine-containing diazines are not the exception; they have attracted attention of medicinal chemists since 1950s when Fluorouracil (1) was introduces as anti-cancer drug. Analysis of MDDR (MDL Drug Data Report) data retrieved 1,150 hits derived from fluorine-containing diazines [3]. Nearly a third part of them is represented by anti-cancer agents (Fig. 1); other important classes (more than 100 examples) include compounds with antiviral (mainly anti-HIV) and antiarthritic activity.\n\n",

The first representative of this class, Fluorouracil (1) was developed by Charles Heidelberger and co-workers in 1957 [4]. It was approved by U.S. FDA [5] in 1962 as antineoplastic agent in the treatment of advanced colorectal cancer. Fluorouracil represents a class of rationally designed anticancer agents which act as antimetabolites. The observation that rat hepatomas utilized radiolabeled uracil more avidly than normal tissues [6] implied that the enzymatic pathways for utilization of uracil or its close analogs differed between malignant and normal cells \u2013 a feature which might provide a target for antimetabolite chemotherapy. A minimal modification of uracil by introducing a single fluorine atom allowed for implementation of cellular uptake and metabolic activation of 1 via the same transport processes and enzymes involved in the case of uracil. However, in the case of essential biological targets, remarkable differences are observed due to unique properties of the fluorine atoms, which result in inhibition of the metabolic and signal pathways involved. Although all the details of the mechanism by which Fluorouracil gives its biological effect are not elucidated, a remarkable progress has been made over the past half a century in elucidating its cellular and clinical pharmacology [7, 8].",

Up to 80 % of 1 administered as injection is transformed to dihydrofluorouracil (DHFU, 13) by dihydropyrimidine dihydrogenase (mostly in liver tissues). However, this metabolite is not involved into antineoplastic activity; instead, 13 itself and its further metabolites are responsible for most of the toxic effects of 1. The main mechanism of activation of Fluorouracil is conversion to fluorouridine monophosphate (FUMP, 14), either directly by orotate phosphoribosyltransferase, or via fluorouridine (FUR, 15) through the sequential action of uridine phosphorylase and uridine kinase. 14 is then phosphorylated to give fluorouridine diphosphate (FUDP, 16), which can be either phosphorylated again to the active metabolite fluorouridine triphosphate (FUTP, 19), or reduced to fluorodeoxyuridine diphosphate (FdUDP, 18) by ribonucleotide reductase. In turn, 18 can either be dephosphorylated or phosphorylated to generate the active metabolites fluorodeoxyuridine monophosphate (FdUMP, 19) and fluorodeoxyuridine triphosphate (FdUTP, 19), respectively.\n\n",

On the contrary, when 4 is slowly administered into the arterial blood, it is mostly transformed to 19; thus toxic effects are diminished comparing to 1 [10].",

            "text": "It has long been recognized that one of the main mechanisms underlying Fluorouracil action is inhibition of thymidylate synthase by fluorodeoxyuridine monophosphate (19) [11]. Thymidylate synthase belongs to a class of enzymes required for DNA replication, and its activity is higher in rapidly proliferating cells. In particular, thymidylate synthase is responsible for methylation of deoxyuridine monophosphate (dUMP, 21) to deoxythymidine monophosphate (dTMP, 22) with the use of 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate (23) as a cofactor (Scheme 2) [12]. With fluorodeoxyuridine monophosphate, a slowly-reversible ternary complex 24 is formed instead. Inhibition of thymidylate synthase leads to deoxyribonucleotide imbalance, and hence to interference with DNA synthesis and repair. Alternative mechanism of DNA-directed Fluorouracil effect is misincorporation of fluorodeoxyuridine triphosphate (20) into DNA. Analogously, fluorouridine triphosphate (17) is extensively incorporated into different RNA species, disrupting their normal processing and function [7, 8, 11].\n\n",

Both the compounds are close analogues as well as prodrugs of Doxifluridine (5), which was used as the lead compound in their design. The main goals of such design were to minimize the mielotoxicity and to increase the tumor selectivity of 5. In fact, Capecitabine (6) indeed demonstrated minimal mielotoxicity in clinical studies. Although the therapeutic indices of 39 were much higher in mice tumor models than in the case of 5, it was not efficiently metabolised to the active species in humans. The metabolic activation of 6 and 39 includes their hydrolysis by carboxylesterase or acylamidase in liver to give 5\u2032-deoxy-5-fluorocytidine (47), which is then transformed to 5 by cytidine deaminase (Scheme 8) [48].\n\n",

A completely different synthetic scheme commenced from fluoroacetic acid which was subjected to Vilsmeier-type formylation to give 2-fluoro-3-dimethylamino-acrolein (72) [87]. Reaction of 72 with triethyloxonium tetrafluoroborate and dimethylamine gave the salt 73, which led to 38 upon reaction with urea.

In addition, these kinases also sequester CDK interacting and kinase inhibitory proteins (Cip/Kip) from their complexes with cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2), facilitating activation of CDK2 with cyclin E [115] Monomesylate salt of 87 inhibits CDK4 and CDK6 with IC50 values of 2 and 10 nM, respectively; moreover, it is able to cross blood-brain barrier and therefore has the potential for the treatment of brain tumors and metastases [114].",

Reaction of 193 with lithium cyclopropylacetylenide gave racemic 128 and 129, which were subjected to chiral stationary phase HPLC to isolate 128 and 129 as pure enantiomers [136, 137]. Several improvements were reported for this synthetic scheme. In particular, diastereoselective additions of lithium cyclopropyl acetylenide to the derivatives of 193 containing residues of \u03b1-phenylethyl amine or campheic acid were developed [154, 155]. Moreover, an enantioselective modification of this method employing amino alcohol 194 as an asymmetric catalyst was discovered [156, 157]. Another enantioselective method involved reaction of the derivatives of 193 and cyclopropyl acetylene itself, catalysed by amino alcohol derivatives (e.g.\n195) and Zn(OTf)2 [158].\n\n",

It is however more known as an ophthalmic anti-herpes agent launched by Glaxo Wellcome (now merged into GlaxoSmithKline) in 1980 [5]. It is effective against herpetic keratitis, and seems to be especially useful in \u2018difficult\u2019 cases [160]. High susceptibility to biodegradation of Trifluridine is advantageous for its use as ophthalmic drug, as its action in other tissues is thus prevented. As in the case of anti-tumor activity, the mechanism of antiviral action of 7 involves the inhibition of viral replication. Trifluridine does this by incorporating into viral DNA during replication, which leads to the formation of defective proteins and an increased mutation rate [161]. Inhibition of thymidylate synthetase also seems to contribute into antiviral effect of 7. The details of these processes, as well as synthesis of 7 were discussed in the above sections.",

Compound 210 acts as an inhibitor of peptide deformylase \u2013 an enzyme that removes the formyl group during eubacterial peptide elongation. Bacterial protein synthesis initiates with formyl-methionyl-tRNA and, consequently, all polypeptides newly synthesized in bacteria contain an N-formyl-methionine terminus. This residue is further removed in two steps catalyzed by peptide deformylase and methionine aminopeptidase, respectively. Inhibition of peptide deformylase increase production of bacterial N-formylated polypeptide, which prevents bacteria growth and possibly triggers an enhanced immune response [170]. Peptide deformylase is a metalloprotease, which mostly utilizes Fe2+ in its active site. It was shown for analogs of 210 that N-formyl-N-hydroxylamine function coordinated to metal ion when the inhibitor was bound to the enzyme [171].",

Flucytosine itself has no antifungal activity; its activity results from the rapid conversion into Fluorouracil (1) within susceptible fungal cells [173]. The mechanism of cytotoxic effect of Fluorouracil has been discussed in the previous sections. Flucytosine is taken up by fungal cells by cytosine permease, which is the transport system for cytosine and adenine. Inside the fungal cells, 9 is deaminated to 1 by cytosine deaminase. The specificity of this step is crucial for the narrow antifungal spectrum of 9: mammalian cells as well as fungi lacking cytosine deaminase are not sensitive to 9. On the other hand, Fluorouracil itself cannot be used as an antifungal drug, since it is only poorly taken up by fungal cells and is too toxic to human cells.\n\n",

In this case, the desired diastereomeric pair was obtained with much better selectivity (6.5: 1). The last approach relied on Reformatsky-type reaction involving 222 and bromides 226 (prepared from 223 [191, 192] or its thio analogues [193\u2013195]) or sulfonates 227 (prepared from 93) (Scheme 56) [196, 197].

For ABT-925 (229), Phase II trials were terminated in 2011; for JNJ-37822681 (230), the latest clinical study was completed in February 2012 [113]. Despite the disease addressed by 228\u2013230 is common, the compounds express their effect through interactions with different biological targets. In particular, BMY-14802 (228) developed by Bristol-Myers Squibb acts as a dual antagonist of \u03c31 and 5-HT1A receptors. However, it should be noted that relative role of these two targets in biological effect of 228 was debated in the literature. Whereas in pigeons, the effect was serotonergically mediated primarily through 5-HT1A receptors [203], in other model systems, these interactions did not seem to contribute significantly to the potential antipsychotic action of the compound [204]. Although studies in animal models supported for the suggestion that BMY-14802 (228) may possess antipsychotic properties [205], clinical trials showed lack of efficacy in Schizophrenia treatment [206].",

Development of BW-4030W92 was discontinued in 2002; the latest Phase II clinical studies of GW-842166X were completed in 2009 [113]. BW-4030W92 (232) was developed as a CNS-acting antihyperalgesic agent (i.e. for treatment of increased sensitivity to pain). It is an analogue of anticonvulsant drug Lamotrigine (260) (Fig. 9), used n the treatment of epilepsy and bipolar disorder [233]. Like Lamotrigine, BW-4030W92 binds to the transmembrane segment S6 in domain IV of \u03b1 subunit of voltage-gated sodium channels (Nav), thus acting as a pore blocker [234]. It is assumed that neuropathic pain is partially mediated by an increase in the density of NaV channels in injured axons and their dorsal root ganglions. Clinical studies in patients with chronic neuropathic pain showed that although BW-4030W92 significantly lowered allodynia severity at the first day, the effect did not maintain in further treatment [235].\n\n",

As in the case of lymphoma, the effect of 88 in autoimmune diseases is related to inhibition of Spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) by 92 [241, 242]. As Syk has the central role in transmission of activating signals within B cells, inhibition of this enzyme lowers expression of a number of proinflammatory cytokines and hence leads to immunosuppression [243]. Fostamatinib has shown significant efficacy in the treatment of patients with rheumatoid arthritis not responding to Methotrexate (272) (a drug which is used conventionally in therapy), although a number of adverse events were observed [244]. If these results are confirmed once Phase III studies are completed, it may find a place in the treatment of patients with rheumatoid arthritis with poor response to conventional therapy (Fig. 11).\n\n",

The first representative of this class, Sitagliptin (273) was launched in 2006. In human body, Gemigliptin is metabolized to LC15-0636, which is a major active metabolite, by cytochrome P450 3A4 isozyme [246]. Inhibition of DPP-4 results in increase of incretin levels (which is normally inactivated by DPP-4), in particular glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and gastric inhibitory peptide (GIP) [247]. Incretins inhibit glucagons release and stimulate insulin secretion, which leads to decrease in glucose blood levels. Clinical trials showed efficacy and safety of Gemigliptin administered once daily as a monotherapy, [248] as well as in addition to Metformin (274) [249] for type 2 diabetes patients.",

Ru-catalyzed oxidation of 280 led to the formation of amide 281, which was subjected to ring-opening with NaOMe and then acidic deprotection to give hydrochloride 276. To obtain 277, N-Boc-3-piperidone was deprotonated and then acylated with ethyl trifluoroacetate to give \u03b2-diketone 282. Reaction of 282 with trifluoroacetamidine followed by deprotection afforded 277. Further step of the synthesis included reductive amination of aldehyde 275 with amine 276, which was accompanied with piperidone ring formation to give 283. Full deprotection of 283 followed by selective protection of the amino group gave carboxylic acid 284, which was coupled with amine 277 to afford Boc derivative 285. Finally, deprotection of 285 led to the formation of Gemigliptin (12).\n\n",

When present in cytoplasm, 304 is cytotoxic due to interaction with oxygen upon action of light, which results in formation of singlet O2 molecules. 1O2 causes lipid peroxidation, membrane disruption and plant cell death.\n\n",

This enzyme, also referred to as ubiquinol: ferricytochrome c reductase, or complex III, is the third complex in the electron transport chain \u2013 a cascade of enzymes which couples electron transfer between NADH and O2 with the transfer of H+ ions across a membrane to generate chemical energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) [287]. The overall result of the reaction catalyzed by cytochrome bc\n1 complex is reduction of ferricytochrome c by oxidation of ubiquinol (355) and the concomitant pumping of 4 protons from the mitochondrial matrix to the intermembrane space. The mechanism of this process is too sophisticated to be discussed herein. It is important that the enzyme has two binding sites for the substrate 355 or its oxidized form 356 (Fig. 14), i.e. outer (Q0) and inner (Q1), and the quinone outside inhibitors bind to the outer site. This leads to inhibition of mitochondrial respiration \u2013 a process which is essential to all living organisms. The selective biological effect of quinone outside inhibitors on certain organisms (i.e. fungi or mites) is achieved by differential penetration and degradation between various species, leading to a combination of high fungicidal (or acaricidal, in the case of 301) potency and good crop safety [288]. Unfortunately, resistance has already evolved to this class of pesticides in some plant pathogens in certain geographical areas [289].\n\n",

It is reported to control aphids, whiteflies, and cotton leafworm, but has no activity against thrips [296]. Since Flufenerim is chemically related to Pyrimidifen (Miteclean\u00ae 369) (Fig. 16), it was initially believed to have similar mechanism of action, i.e. inhibition of the mitochondrial electron transport of NADH dehydrogenase (NADH: ubiquinone oxidoreductase, complex I) \u2013 an enzyme which transfers electrons from NADH to ubiquinone and hence opens the electron transport chain cascade. Nevertheless, it was shown that 302 reduced activity of acetylcholinesterase \u2013 an effect which possibly can be addressed to interaction with other systems [297].\n\n",

Undoubtedly the success was achieved due to joint progress of medicinal chemistry, agrochemistry as well as synthetic methods of heterocyclic and fluoroorganic chemistry. The continued progresses in these fields of science allow us to predict that the number of fluorine containing diazines as drugs or agrochemicals on the market will be increased. Recent trends in using of perfluorinated diazines as core scaffold for the synthesis of a diverse array of polysubstituted fluorinated diazines for HTS increases probability of these compounds as potential hits and leads. Also the new methodologies of direct introduction of fluorinated substituent, like Baran approach, continue to appear facilitating further investigation. Moreover in the chemical space covered by fluorinated diazines remains \u201cwhite spots\u201d. Thus diazine scaffold decorated by important in med and agrochem fluorinated fragments such as -CHF2, -CH2CF3, -OCF3, -SCF3, -SF5 not investigated because the synthetic chemistry of these compounds on development phase or not developed at all. Therefore the comprehensive investigations in the field of fluorinated diazines still are interesting both for academic and industrial scientists.",
