The onset of symptoms was from January 13 to February 5, 2020, peaking on January 23, 8 days prior to the peak of the public epidemic. The suspected sites of exposure were general wards (79.2%), public places at the hospital (20.8%), operating rooms (12.5%), the intensive care unit (4.2%), and the outpatient clinic (4.2%). There was transmission from these doctors to others in 25% of cases, including to family members (20.8%), colleagues (4.2%), patients (4.2%), and friends (4.2%). Moreover, participation in real-time training on prevention measures was found to have a protective effect against COVID-19. Furthermore, not wearing an N95 respirator was found to be a risk factor and wearing respirators or masks all the time was found to be protective. Severe fatigue was found to be a risk factor for infection with COVID-19 [28].",
