More than half the population resides in the city\u2019s Rimuka Township. Nearly the whole population in Kadoma city has access to piped water. However, demand for water is very high, reaching as high as 60 mega litres per day, yet the city can only pump at best 25 mega litres per day [5]. The quantity of water pumped is further compromised by recurrent power cuts to the water treatment plants. In the absence of municipal water, residents use shallow wells and boreholes among others as water sources [5].",

The questions were in English and local Shona languages. Record review of water surveillance reports was done. The water quality parameters tested were bacteriological and chemical (chlorine content for municipal water, and pH). Bacteriological water quality tests had been done using a Delagua field testing machine. Water samples that were found with zero colonies after incubation for 24 hours were considered satisfactory. Residual chlorine content was tested using the Lovibond Comparator using DPD 1 tablets (N,N Diethyl-1.4 Phenylenediamine sulphate) to check colour changes. Specimens within the range 0.2 to 0.5 parts per million (ppm) were considered satisfactory. The pH was measured with the same equipment using phenol red tablets. Specimens with pH ranging between 6.5 and 8.5 were considered satisfactory. The results were reported as proportions.",

It is biologically plausible for infection to be spread from one person into the water, then to the next person. Having a hand washing facility at home was found to be protective as the facility encourages run to waste method of hand washing, especially after using the toilet. These findings are supported by several studies. A systematic review of several studies, estimated that appropriate hand washing with soap, could reduce the risks of severe intestinal infections and of shigellosis by up to 48% and 59%, respectively [12].",

The laboratory tests on municipal water which was of satisfactory bacteriological and residual chlorine levels support the findings. At the same time, families who accessed water from municipal supply are more likely to access water in the family home. This study demonstrated that distance of the water source from home increased risk of developing diarrhoea. This results in families accessing less than the required amount of water per day, compromising personal hygiene practices such as hand washing.",

In Belarus, Kramer M.S. et al., 2001, reported that exclusive breast feeding reduced risk of diarrhoea by 40% [16]. In Guinea Bissau, M\u00f8lbalk K, et al., 1996, reported that partial breast feeding, RR = 1.23(1.08-1.40), and no breast feeding RR = 1.37(1.37-1.91) increased risk of diarrhoea [17]. In Zimbabwe, a nutritional survey in 2010 reported that 5.8% of children were exclusively breast fed [18].
