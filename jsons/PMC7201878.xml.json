            "text": "The spatial distribution of animals is an essential part of their population dynamics because it reflects the behaviour of individuals within the population as well as demographic changes (Anderson et al. 1982; Taylor et al. 1983). Various indices of spatial distribution (also called indices of dispersion) have been proposed and most are based on different combinations of estimates of the population variance and mean. The simplest approach is therefore to examine the relationship between the spatial variance (s\n2) and mean (m). The spatial distribution of individuals in a population can be random (s\n2 = m), regular, uniform or even (s\n2 < m), or aggregated, clumped or contagious (s\n2 > m). As contagious implies that the animals are influencing each other\u2019s distribution, and clumped implies an active gathering together, the term aggregation is preferred here because it has no implication of causation (Taylor 1984). True population randomness requires that no individual animal can influence others of the same species. It is therefore very rare in nature (Taylor, Woiwod & Perry 1978). Regular distributions are also rare, except in colonial animals or laboratory populations. Aggregation is therefore the most common type of distribution, but the degree of aggregation varies considerably.",

It can also change within a life cycle; for example, b increased markedly when larvae of some Trichoptera species aggregated prior to pupation on large stones in streams (Elliott 1981, 1982a, 1982b). The spatial distribution of stream invertebrates may be related to several factors, including their favoured habitat (e.g. surfaces of large stones, shelters under large stones, gravel or mud), their feeding preferences (e.g. herbivore, carnivore, omnivore) and their mobility (e.g. sedentary, slow movers, fast movers). There may be ontogenetic changes in the spatial distribution and, ideally, each instar of aquatic insects should be treated separately. This is rarely feasible (but see Elliott 1981, 1982a, 1982b) and therefore, as a compromise, larvae in the present study were divided into those greater and smaller than half the maximum length attained just before pupation in Trichoptera, and emergence in Ephemeroptera and Plecoptera.",

            "text": "Most stream invertebrates are nocturnal and their increased activity at night often leads to an increase in upstream movements, and in downstream dispersal through the mechanism of invertebrate drift (see reviews by Allan 1995; Rader 1997). An obvious conclusion from all this nocturnal activity is that the spatial distribution of the invertebrates may change from day to night. This aspect of their population dynamics has been ignored, but such changes in spatial distribution are an important aspect of the fundamental biological process of dispersal by stream invertebrates, i.e. their movement away from their point of origin (Palmer, Allan & Butman 1996). Normally, dispersal is studied over long time scales, but daily changes may be just as important and may provide insight into the ecology of each species. It may be expected that day\u2013night changes in spatial distribution would not occur in sedentary species, or species that burrow in gravel or mud and are thus not exposed to changes in light intensity. Conversely, marked day\u2013night changes would be expected in species living on or near the surface of the stream bed, especially species that are known to be more active at night. These ecological expectations can only be tested by comparing day and night samples, as in the present study.",

Modal depth ranged from 0\u00b716 to 0\u00b720 m and modal width from 3\u00b70 to 3\u00b77 m for the different samples. The substratum was large stones (diameter up to 0\u00b73 m) over smaller stones and gravel, with sparse clumps of bryophytes on the larger stones and exposed bedrock.

To check if sample order affected the results, day samples were taken before night samples in 1966 and 1968, and night samples before day samples in 1967 and 1969. Samples were taken with a Hess\u2013Waters cylindrical sampler (Waters & Knapp 1961), with a net mesh aperture of 0\u00b7265 mm and a sampling area of 0\u00b70929 m2. The sampling site was 32 m long and was divided by a grid into 1200 sampling units, each with the area of the sampler. To ensure that it was adequately covered by the sampling, the site was divided longitudinally into five strata, each with an area of approximately 22 m2, and 12 sampling units were selected at random from a possible 240 units in each stratum. Six of these units were then allocated randomly to the day sample and six to the night sample. Therefore, each day or night sample was a stratified random sample of 30 sampling units (n = 30). Only 2\u00b75% of the site was sampled in the day or night. Once the sampling units were selected, sampling commenced in an upstream direction. The animals were preserved in ethanol, and identified in the laboratory. Before counting, larvae were measured from the front of the head to the tip of the abdomen (to nearest mm), and sorted into those greater than half\u2010size, and those less than or equal to half\u2010size. Half\u2010size was half the mean length of the last larval instar and varied from 3 mm for the smallest species of Ephemeroptera to 9 mm for the largest species of Plecoptera.",

Therefore, the degree of aggregation actually decreased at night for the lower densities while increasing at medium to high densities (e.g. Fig. 1a,b). For Heptagenia lateralis and Rhithrogena semicolorata, values of a did not change significantly from day to night while values of b increased significantly. Therefore, at lower densities the spatial distribution remained close to random during both day and night, while aggregation increased at night for medium to high densities (e.g. Fig. 1c).

The second hypothesis was also supported by most analyses with no significant difference in the spatial distribution of larvae greater and smaller than half\u2010size for each species. Three of the four exceptions were probably due to inadequate data for testing differences, but the fourth, Odontocerum albicorne, appeared to be genuine with large larvae being significantly less aggregated than small larvae, but only at night when the larvae are known to be most active (Elliott 1970). The third hypothesis, proposing significant differences between diurnal and nocturnal distributions, was rejected for nine species but supported for the other 12 species.",

Values of a and b for the nine species in the first group did not change significantly from day to night, so that the spatial distribution of these species remained fairly constant (Fig. 6a). Four of these species are burrowers in gravel or moss; Baetis muticus, Leuctra inermis and L. fusca have a long, thin body shape as does their major predator, Siphonoperla torrentium, while larvae of Caenis rivulorum burrow in muddy gravel (Hynes 1941; Elliott, Humpesch & Macan 1988). It is notable that the spatial distribution of the only predator, S. torrentium, in this group was very similar to that of its prey in the group. The case\u2013building Trichoptera species, Agapetus fuscipes, grazes on epilithon from the upper surface of large stones and moves very slowly in both the day and night. Its aggregated distribution is obviously due to the larvae being restricted to large stones. The net\u2013spinning Trichoptera species, Hydropsyche siltalai, was aggregated over a wide range of densities, and this probably reflects the limited number of suitable sites for this species to construct its nets (Edington & Hildrew 1995). The two remaining species in this first group, the stonefly Perlodes microcephalus and the free\u2013living caddis Rhyacophila dorsalis, are both very active predators. Their spatial distribution in both day and night was very close to a random distribution, with values of a and b both close to one (species 3 and 7 in Fig. 6a).",

Activity increases at night in all four species and their larvae are essentially nocturnal foragers (Elliott 1969, 1970). Larvae of O. albicorne are omnivores while the other three species are herbivores. The present study has shown that during their nocturnal foraging, aggregation of larvae is greatly reduced so that their distribution is close to random with values of a, and especially b, close to one (Fig. 6b). The net product of nocturnal behaviour appears to be a near\u2013random distribution. This does not imply randomness in any specific aspect of behaviour but that, of the many behavioural components that together lead to spatial distribution, those leading to aggregation and those leading to dissociation are evenly balanced (Taylor et al. 1980).",

Isoperla grammatica is the only carnivore in the group and frequently preys on other members of the group. This species is rarely active during the day, most active at dusk and dawn when prey capture is highest, and less active for the rest of the night (Elliott 2000). All eight species are frequently taken in drift samples and also move upstream (see reviews in Introduction). They are therefore highly mobile nocturnal animals that have now been shown to change their spatial distribution from day to night. Although all these species became more aggregated at night (s\n2 > m) when their densities were medium to high, changes at lower densities were more complex. For Heptagenia lateralis, Rhithrogena semicolorata, Protonemura meyeri and Amphinemura sulcicollis, the spatial distribution remained close to random (s\n2 = m) at low densities, but for Baetis rhodani, Ephemerella ignita, Ecdyonurus venosus and Isoperla grammatica, the distribution tended to regularity (s\n2 < m) at low densities. Therefore the degree of aggregation and the associated changes in behaviour were very strongly density\u2013dependent in these eight species.",

            "text": "The classification of most species was expected from their ecology. Five of the nine species in the first group are burrowers in gravel, moss or mud, and are thus not exposed to diel changes in light intensity. One is a sedentary, case\u2013building, Trichoptera species. However, the inclusion of a net\u2013spinning Trichoptera species in this group was unexpected because this species is known to change position in response to changes in water velocity (Edington & Hildrew 1995). The present study does not contradict this observation but simply demonstrates that the degree of aggregation does not change over 24 h. Two other unexpected members of this group were both highly mobile predators that occur on or near the surface of the stream bed. Perlodes microcephalus is active during the day, but only below the substratum, and very active from dusk to dawn with a high prey\u2013capture success (Elliott 2000). Nothing is known about the diel activity and feeding patterns of Rhyacophila dorsalis, but its similar spatial distribution to P. microcephalus suggests that its activity and feeding periodicity may be also similar. Perhaps the near random distribution facilitates the hunting success of these two species and reduces possible intraspecific competition. The 12 species in the second and third groups were expected to show day\u2013night changes in spatial distribution because their larvae occur on or near the surface of the stream bed, and are known to be active at night. The division into the two groups is linked to their presence in the drift, those in the third group being highly mobile species that frequently occur in nocturnal drift, while the four case\u2013building Trichoptera species in the second group rarely occur in the drift. As the larvae of these four nocturnal species were usually found aggregated under stones during the day, their reduced aggregation when they were active at night was not unexpected. Therefore, with a few exceptions, the ecological expectations summarized in the Introduction were supported by the results of this study.",

Therefore the values obtained in the present study were well within the range of values reported for terrestrial animals. It would be useful to test the three hypotheses of the present study on terrestrial species. Such work is of practical importance because the variance\u2013mean relationship affects the transformation of data before they can be analysed by some statistical methods (e.g. Healy & Taylor 1962; Elliott 1977; Downing 1979). It also affects the design of sampling programmes when a certain level of precision is required (e.g. Elliott 1977; Downing 1979; McIntyre, Elliott & Ellis 1984).",

Another example of behavioural change is the active aggregation of larvae prior to pupation in some Trichoptera species, this causing a marked change in the variance\u2013mean relationship (Elliott 1981, 1982a, 1982b). As there do not appear to be any other quantitative studies of day\u2013night changes in spatial distribution, it is not known how frequently such changes occur in terrestrial populations, especially for nocturnal species. Such work is needed because there is now enough evidence to show that behavioural changes in spatial distribution are just as important as demographic changes for a clearer understanding of population dynamics.",
