Peptides have shown several useful properties for human health, including antimicrobial, antifungal, antiviral, and antitumor activities. These compounds are produced by almost all species of life. However, they are produced in limited quantities in nature. As a result, researchers have tried to synthesize bioactive peptides to study their properties and applications in various areas. Among their applications in food preservation, peptides have been incorporated into packaging materials. This review begins with a brief description of the methods used for the synthesis, purification, and characterization of peptides. Also, the main bioproperties and mechanisms of action of peptides are discussed. Finally, some applications of peptides are presented, especially their use in active packaging, their effects on the polymeric matrix, and peptide migration. References Agyei D, Danquah MK. 2011.

The peptides bind to the surface of the target membrane and cover it like a carpet. According to this model, the peptides exhibit a preferential binding for the phospholipid groups. The binding step is followed by the alignment of the peptide on the membrane surface so the hydrophilic surface is in contact with phospholipid or water molecules, causing a reorientation of hydrophilic residues and creating a hydrophobic core. Finally, the peptide disintegrates the membrane by deformation of the membrane curvature (Reddy and others 2004) .

In addition, Luganini and others (2010) reported the inhibition of cytomegalovirus by binding synthetic peptide dendrimers with molecules of heparan sulfate on the surface of fibroblasts and endothelial cells. Thus, cytomegalovirus infection was blocked by the interaction of synthetic peptide binding sites with heparan sulfate.",

The interactions of peptides with the glycoproteins (gp) in the viral envelope have been proposed as another mechanism that influences the process of viral entry and virus inactivation. In this way, peptides generated from chemical modification of milk proteins, such as \u03b1-lactalbumin, \u03b2-lactoglobulin, and lysozyme with 3-hydroxyphthalic anhydride (3-HP) inhibited infection of vero cells with HSV-1 (Oevermann and others 2003) . According to those researchers, the antiviral activity of these peptides is based on their direct interaction with viral glycoproteins (gB, gC, gD), which are responsible for adsorption and penetration of the virus into the host cell. Similarly, LF has shown the ability to bind to the gp120 glycoprotein (a protein present in the outermost layer of the HIV virus) with antiviral effects, since the gp120 glycoprotein plays an important role in the adsorption and entry of HIV into target cells (van der Strate and others 2001; Pan and others 2006) .",

            "text": "The mechanism of action of antitumor peptides consists of permeabilization of the cell membrane mediated by electrostatic interaction. The electrostatic interaction is generated by the negatively charged phospholipids in the cell membrane and the positively charged peptide (Schweizer 2009 ). Unlike carcinogenic cells, eukaryotic cells have most of their negatively charged phospholipids, particularly PS, in the inner membrane, while neutral lipids are positioned on the outside (Zhao and others 2006) . However, the result obtained by Sand and others (2010) suggests that in addition to the mechanism of action related to the electrostatic interaction, there is another mechanism which explains the sensitivity of normal eukaryotic cells to plactaricin. Probably another negatively charged macromolecule present on the membrane surface of healthy cells is also involved in plantaricin activity. Similar results were observed by Nan and others (2010) in the study of synthetic peptides consisting of lysine or arginine enriched with tryptophan. The peptide with arginine residues showed higher toxicity against human erythrocytes and mammalian cells. The hydrophobicity of the peptides has been suggested as an important factor in the increase of hemolytic activity and cytotoxicity in mammalian cells, as hydrophobic regions are required for direct interaction between peptide with membrane lipid components. The peptide with arginine residues was slightly more hydrophobic than the peptide with lysine residues. Thus, these researchers suggested that small differences in hydrophobicity of these peptides may be responsible for the cytotoxic activity of this peptide in mammalian cells.",

Some of the techniques used in structural analysis of active packaging with antimicrobial peptides are the contact angle, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Steven and Hotchkiss (2008) used the techniques of contact angle and XPS to assess changes in the surface of LDPE films after treatment with chromic oxide and functionalization with PEG as spacer, subsequently covalently binding a synthetic peptide. The contact angle for the film before being subjected to any process of functionalization showed values of 101 \u2022 . However, after chromic oxidation and PEG bonding, films presented values of 61 \u2022 and 45 \u2022 , respectively; which indicated that the film surface became hydrophilic. These researchers concluded that the decrease in the contact angle is the result of an increased ionization at the film surface after oxidation, due to the presence of functional groups, such as carboxylic acid (COOH); and a value even lower after functionalization was observed due to solubility of PEG. The XPS technique showed changes in chemical composition on the film surface, resulting in the detection of nitrogen (2.6%) and an increased percentage of oxygen (initially from 6.7% to 13.3% after oxidation and 19.4% after functionalization). The oxygen increase was due to the presence of carboxylic acid after chromic oxidation. Also, this increase was the result of functionalization with PEG due to the main presence of O 2 in the PEG chain backbone. In addition, the functionalization with PEG also introduced nitrogen originating from its amino-terminal functions (NH 2 -PEG-NH 2 ).",

However, the large concentration would not be maintained over time, depending on the solubility of the antimicrobial in the selected food. If the solubility is very high, the antimicrobial will migrate rapidly to the food matrix, and therefore result in a decreased concentration of the antimicrobial on the food's surface along time. On the other hand, if the release rate is low, the antimicrobial agent will be slowly released in a desired concentration and if it presents a low solubility in the selected food, the antimicrobial can accumulate on the food surface and slowly migrate into the food matrix.

In the study of paper coated with EVA incorporated with nisin, the D-values varied according to the composition of the food in contact with the active packaging (Kim and others 2002) . The highest D-value was observed when the film was in contact with a 2% citric acid solution, and the lowest value was observed when in contact with a 2% NaCl solution. Characteristic parameters of each solution, such as pH and ionic strength, have been shown to influence nisin solubility. Nisin has a high solubility (up to 40 mg\u00b7mL \u22121 at pH 2) at low pH, but at high concentrations of NaCl (above 1 M) nisin solubility dependence on pH almost disappears and the solubility decreases to values below 1 mg\u00b7mL \u22121 at any pH (Rollema and others 1995) . Chollet and others (2009) also investigated the influence of food composition on the migration of nisin incorporated in PE/PA/PE films coated with HPMC by changing the fat percentage. They found that increasing the fat content in the food resulted in an increased D-value and, therefore, in a greater diffusion of incorporated nisin. In their experiment, nisin diffusion mechanism was governed by the fat content. The increase in fat content resulted in microstructural changes, such as enlargement of pore size in the food matrix, which favored nisin diffusion into it.",
