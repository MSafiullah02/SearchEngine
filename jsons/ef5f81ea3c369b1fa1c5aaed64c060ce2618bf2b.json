We also compared trends in HF hospitalizations from 2019 during the same time period to account for the potential for residual confounding based on seasonal trends in HF hospitalizations.

In the two weeks prior to the first diagnosed case of COVID-19 in Mississippi, HF cases averaged 30 per week. After the first diagnosed case in Mississippi, mean HF hospitalizations declined by 50% to 15 per week. HF hospitalizations continued to decline to lower levels after a \"state of emergency\" was declared and even further after the statewide \"shelter in place\" was mandated, with fewer HF hospitalizations in the last two weeks of this analysis. Although we observed week-toweek variability in HF hospitalizations in 2019, we did not observe significant and progressive declines similar to those noted during the current COVID-19 pandemic. Before the first case of COVID-19 was identified in the state of Mississippi, 68.1% of HF cases were HFrEF subtype, 22.4% HFpEF and 9.5% HFmrEF. We observed a very similar distribution of HF subtypes after March 12 including 65.9% HFrEF, 26.8% HFpEF and 7.3% HFmrEF. Our observations from a large tertiary care academic medical center indicate that there was a marked decline in HF hospitalizations during the COVID-19 pandemic. With rare exceptions, most HF hospitalizations are non-elective and represent worsening congestion that can have significant impact on patient outcomes if not treated or delayed.",
