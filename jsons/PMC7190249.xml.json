We used the Pediatric Advanced Life Support definitions15 of normal vital sign ranges in our original PEWS calculation. Before this study, bedside nurses calculated the score manually using scoring rubric badge cards. They then entered the score into nursing flowsheets in our EHR. The score was calculated on all hospitalized children in non-ICU units at least every 4 hours. PEWS was initially used as a trigger for mandatory rapid response team (RRT) activation when it surpassed 4, but this trigger was removed in Fall 2017. At the time of this study, PEWS continued to be calculated on all hospitalized patients with no mandatory action based on a given score. Once manually entered into the EHR, the score was displayed prominently in the EHR in care-team facing locations as well as on the provider handoff tool.16 A color gradient assisted in characterizing this PEWS value into low (<3), intermediate (3\u20134), and high risk (>4) groups.

We considered the actual respiratory subset score for the manual PEWS or AutoPEWS inaccurate if they were lower than the expected minimum score. We did not consider scores inaccurate if they were higher than the expected minimum score because the higher score could have been related to other PEWS inputs independent of respiratory rates such as levels of oxygen support or signs of difficulty breathing.

Because we collected PEWS values once daily, we paired deterioration outcomes with PEWS if the outcome occurred within the 24 hours following data collection. To control for potential confounders and repeated measures for each outcome, we identified covariates for inclusion in a generalized linear mixed model (GLIMMIX). We identified age and gender a priori due to their clinical relevance and included admitting service and repeat event based on inclusion criteria (P < 0.2) from the bivariable analysis. Due to sample size limitations, there was no adjustment for any covariates in CDE analysis. The predicted probabilities from GLIMMIX were used to calculate the area under the curve (AUC) for each combination of PEWS and outcome. For each outcome, the manual PEWS ROC and the AutoPEWS ROCs were compared by taking the difference in AUC. We used an inferiority margin of 0.05 to determine non-inferiority, meaning AutoPEWS would be considered non-inferior to the manual PEWS if the lower limit of the 95% confidence interval for the AUC difference between scores was >\u22120.05.21,22",

We hypothesize that many of the inaccuracies in the manual PEWS calculation occur in patients for whom the care-team has not yet developed concern. Because manual calculation is prone to human error, care-team members may be more likely to enter a low manual PEWS (eg, 0 or 1) without truly addressing the scoring rubric when they are not worried about a patient. This impression is supported by the lower mean total manual PEWS compared with AutoPEWS in our study population. Additionally, care-team members may be more likely to skip a calculation altogether when they are not worried about a patient, which is a possible explanation for the 2% of cases with missing manual PEWS values in our data.",

Team members, therefore, are at risk to miss subtle changes in clinical status that may have otherwise alerted the care-team of impending deterioration earlier in the process than they observed on their own. Similarly, when care-team members are worried about a patient, they may be more likely to document a more accurate and often higher PEWS, and they may even document a higher PEWS than the rubric would suggest, aligning the score with their level of worry. The primary issue with the behavior suggested by this hypothesis is that PEWS is meant to be a surveillance score to alert care-team members before they are worried to redirect attention to an at-risk patient before the care-team would otherwise be aware. If PEWS does not begin to rise until a care-team member becomes worried about the patient\u2014and the score then becomes more accurate\u2014it cannot fulfill its original purpose of rising before care-team awareness. Automation of the score within the EHR solves this problem by removing the care-team member from the calculation. A rising AutoPEWS\u2014calculated by the EHR and displayed in a front-facing manner to the care-team\u2014may alert the team that a patient about whom they were previously not concerned may warrant closer monitoring and assessment than otherwise would have been provided.",

Though several published studies have evaluated the ability of various PEWS to predict impending deterioration, few have considered whether the scores represent the intended clinical information. Our findings suggest PEWS may be frequently inaccurate when manually calculated by care-team members. As such, further caution is needed when using PEWS as a clinical decision tool to trigger interventions automatically. Additionally, steps should be taken to move toward leveraging available technologies to automate PEWS within EHRs rather than relying on manual calculation by care-team members.",

Though this is an important consideration, PEWS was not created as a tool to verify that a patient is deteriorating after the care-team has become concerned, but rather as a tool to alert the care-team that a patient is at risk for deterioration before team awareness that they should be concerned. Consequently, PEWS may not be the most efficient tool for quantifying a care-team member\u2019s \u201cworry\u201d and empowering him/her to speak up. We, therefore, feel the benefit of obtaining a more accurate score earlier in the process of deterioration through AutoPEWS calculation outweighs any benefit that may come from the correlation between the higher manual PEWS and care-team member worry. Other tools exist to quantify care-team member worry and facilitate assertion practices, and their implementation should be considered as part of a comprehensive care escalation system.",

Consequently, it is most appropriate to conclude that the manual PEWS calculation was inaccurate at least 14% of the time and that the true number is likely significantly higher. Leveraging technology within our EHR to automate PEWS calculation\u2014thus removing human error\u2014greatly improved its accuracy to nearly 100%, which we would expect to remain true even when all inputs are evaluated.",

In all 7 cases, we discovered the AutoPEWS calculation functioned appropriately within our EHR, and the perceived inaccuracy was due exclusively to an error in our analysis. Specifically, our analysis used patient age in months to determine normal respiratory rate ranges\u2014and, therefore, expected respiratory subset scores\u2014while the EHR used age in days within AutoPEWS. In all 7 cases, we would have considered AutoPEWS accurate if we calculated the expected respiratory subset score using the same age range as the EHR.
