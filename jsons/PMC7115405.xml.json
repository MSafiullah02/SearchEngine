The choice of syringe by stockpilers is not merely of academic or financial interest; it will be a major determinant of life or death in a pandemic. Given the scale of need for vaccine and the limited capacity of manufacturers to supply it, shortages will be inevitable. Such will be the outcry for vaccine that officials expect major social and political upheavals [18]. It is therefore of paramount importance to stock a syringe which will reduce vaccine wastage to a minimum and thereby allow the greatest number of persons to be vaccinated. In our experience, discussions on pandemic preparedness often overlook the critical role of the \u2018lowly\u2019 syringe. We continue to do this at our own peril.",

Measurement of the mean and S.D. of total doses obtained and a comparison of its proximity to 10 doses per vial were used to assess the performance of the various devices to make maximum use of vial capacity as well as an indirect assessment of accuracy and residual/waste. From the distribution of volumes from 5 mL vials we were able to estimate how many draws (under optimal conditions; i.e. where there is zero loss) might be achieved. Knowing that there was usually a 10% overfill, we estimated, before study commencement, that ideally the percentage of 9-draw vials would be approximately 2%, 10-draw vials approximately 15%, 11-draw vials approximately 80% and 12-draw vials approximately 3%. Comparison of the performance of each device to these optimal draw values was made.",

The dead-space in a syringe is the volume of fluid that is drawn up but not injected; this volume is trapped inside the syringe as a function of the design of the device. This parameter was evaluated in a separate bench experiment in which 40 syringes from each of the 7 device categories were weighed empty and then filled with 0.5 mL of saline; the saline was expelled by fully depressing the plunger and the device was immediately weighed.

Injection devices with less dead-space, also known as \u2018dose-sparing\u2019 devices, can increase the amount of useable vaccine in a multi-dose vial allowing for greater distribution of the vaccine. Clinical testing and customer-documented experience have shown that the available vaccine can be extended by 7\u201310% through the use of these devices. Therefore the use of injection devices with dose-sparing capabilities is a relatively low cost solution to maximizing flu vaccination yields.",
