[11] describe an Italian multicenter retrospective-prospective observational study on neurological manifestations of COVID-19 (NEURO-COVID) in which hospitalized patients will be recruited either in neurological wards or in COVID wards; in the latter cases they will be referred from other specialists to participant neurologists. Outpatients with clinical signs of COVID and neurological manifestations will be also referred to participating neurologists from primary care physicians. A comprehensive data collection, in the form of electronic case report form (eCRF), will register all possible neurological manifestations involving central nervous systems, peripheral nerves and muscles, together with clinical, laboratory (including cerebrospinal fluid, if available), imaging, neurological, neurophysiological, and neuropsychological data. A follow-up at hospital discharge (in hospitalized patients), and for all patients after 3 and 6 months is also planned. The authors believe that this study may help to intercept the full spectrum of neurological manifestations of COVID-19 and, given the large diffusion at national level, can provide a large cohort of patients available for future more focused investigations. Similar observational studies might also be proposed at international level to better define the neurological involvement of COVID-19.",

Nobody seemed to know what the disease was, where it came from or how to stop it. Anxious minds are inquiring to-day whether another wave of it will come again [\u2026]. It is necessary to shut off those who are capable of giving off the virus from those who are capable of being infected, or vice versa. This is a very difficult procedure. First, it is difficult because it is impossible to discover all the virus producers. Second, it is difficult because it is impossible to know who are and who are not immune. Complete isolation is not feasible for entire cities nor for parts of cities, nor for individuals in cities. It is feasible for some small towns and villages, and some have tried it with success. The fact that in many instances the attack has been merely postponed by no means invalidates the principle [\u2026]. The development of the disease was undoubtedly a complicated biological phenomenon. A virus was produced which was capable of overcoming the resistance of a large proportion of those who were exposed to it [\u2026]. First as to the things which it is desirable not to do. It is not desirable to close theaters, churches and schools unless public opinion emphatically demands it. It is not desirable to make the general wearing of masks compulsory. Patients should not be masked except when traveling from one point to another -they need air. Suspects should wear masks until their cases are positively diagnosed. Influenza patients should be kept separate from other patients. A case of influenza should be dealt with as though it was as contagious as a case of small-pox: there is danger in the presence of the sick, in his eating utensils, in his clothes and in the air into which he coughs and sneezes, if indeed these respiratory symptoms are present. He is to be regarded as much more seriously ill than his visible symptoms perhaps indicate. It is worthwhile to give more attention to the avoidance of unnecessary personal risks and to the promotion of better personal health [\u2026].",

Your nose, not your mouth was made to breathe through-get the habit. 4. Remember the three C\u2019s-a clean mouth, clean skin, and clean clothes. 5. Try to keep cool when you walk and warm when you ride and sleep. 6. Open the windows-always at home at night; at the office when practicable. 7. Food will win the war if you give it a chance-help by choosing and chewing your food well. 8. Your fate may be in your own handswash your hands before eating. 9. Don\u2019t let the waste products of digestion accumulate-drink a glass or two of water on getting up. 10. Don\u2019t use a napkin, towel, spoon, fork, glass or cup which has been used by another person and not washed. 11. Avoid tight clothes, tight shoes, tight gloves-seek to make nature your ally not your prisoner. 12. When the air is pure breathe all of it you can-breathe deeply.\u201d",
