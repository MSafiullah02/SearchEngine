            "text": "Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a significant cause of liver\u2010related morbidity and mortality, particularly in regions of high endemicity [1]. The natural course and clinical outcome of HBV infection is mediated by a complex interaction between the virus and the host\u2019s immune response. Successful control of HBV replication is associated with a strong, multi\u2010specific CD4+ and CD8+ T\u2010cell response in conjunction with a humoral immune response [2, 3, 4, 5]. Based on current understanding of host\u2013virus interactions and the natural course of HBV infection, management strategies have focussed on enhancement of the host\u2019s HBV\u2010specific T\u2010cell response and direct suppression of HBV replication to attain sustained viral control and remission of liver disease [6, 7]. Of the currently available anti\u2010HBV therapies, only interferon (IFN)\u2010\u03b1 and pegylated IFN\u2010\u03b1 have demonstrated an immunomodulatory effect on HBV [8]. The immunomodulatory effect has been reported with the nucleoside ribavirin; the mechanisms of action are considered to be Th1 cell differentiation and upregulation of activity of double\u2010stranded (ds) RNA\u2010activated protein kinase [9, 10, 11]. Very little is known about the influence of newer oral nucleosides on the T\u2010cell\u2010specific immune response.",

In the 2\u2010year analysis of the GLOBE study, the rate of hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) seroconversion during telbivudine administration was higher than during lamivudine administration in patients with serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels greater than two times the upper limit of normal (ULN) [17]. The relatively high HBeAg seroconversion rate attained with telbivudine differs from the rates obtained with other potent anti\u2010HBV agents and suggests that telbivudine potentially has immunomodulatory activities.",

This finding is consistent with the fact that telbivudine is highly selective for HBV and lacks activity against other viruses [12]. This study showed that telbivudine, at concentrations that are achieved in vivo, enhanced the production of TNF\u2010\u03b1 and IL\u201012 in BALB/cJ macrophages in vitro when challenged with MHV\u20103.

However, these studies in patients with CHB do not allow dissection of whether the effect on adaptive immunity is due to direct immunomodulatory properties of the antiviral agent or a secondary to reduced viraemia and antigen levels. The advantage of our mouse model is that it allows investigation of potential immunomodulatory effects independent of antiviral activity. The use of MHV\u20103, which produces a strain\u2010dependent pattern of viral hepatitis in inbred strains of mice, has brought insights into the pathogenesis of viral hepatitis [27, 28, 29, 30, 31]. A previous study using an MHV\u20103 virus\u2010induced hepatitis model from our group showed that ribavirin preserves Th1 cytokine production but inhibits Th2 cytokine response; the study explored the remarkable increased sustained virological response post interferon and ribavirin combination therapy for hepatitis C patients [9].",

In this study, telbivudine treatment significantly improved survival in MHV\u20103\u2010infected C3H mice and it improved clinical conditions and histological outcomes. The treatment of MHV\u20103\u2010infected C3H mice with telbivudine resulted in the inhibition of IL\u20104 production, and similar doses of telbivudine enhanced the production of IFN\u2010\u03b3, and furthermore increased total T cell numbers, IFN\u2010\u03b3\u2010producing CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and TNF\u2010\u03b1\u2010producing CD4+ T cells, indicating a predominantly Th1 response post telbivudine treatment.",

A Th1 response has been associated with host resistance whereas a Th2 response has been associated with susceptibility in murine models of MHV\u20103. Studies have suggested that resistance to MHV\u20103 is associated with a predominant Th1 response, the production of IFN, and cytotoxic T cells [33, 34]. Cytotoxic lymphocytes kill target cells by two major pathways: one is dependent on the exocytosis of granule effector molecules, including perforin and granzymes A and B; the other is dependent on the engagement of target cell TNFR\u20101 family death receptors (e.g. Fas, TNFR\u20101, TNFR\u20102) by effector cell\u2010expressed FasL, membrane\u2010bound or secreted TNF, or TNF\u2010related apoptosis\u2010inducing ligand [35, 36, 37]. Our results demonstrate that FasL plays an important role in cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) cytotoxicity to hepatocytes in MHV\u20103\u2010infected C3H mice. However, telbivudine treatment did not promote CTL cytotoxicity. Previous studies have established that TNF\u2010\u03b1 and IFN\u2010\u03b3 are key cytokines for non\u2010cytolytic control of HBV replication [38, 39, 40]. The release of these cytokines from T cells leads to inactivation of HBV without killing the infected hepatocytes. Our results suggest that telbivudine is altering the balance of Th1/Th2 cytokines which is independent of the direct antiviral effect against MHV\u20103.",

In chronic viral infection, CD8 T cells express high levels of PD\u20101, but its ligand PD\u2010L1 is also highly upregulated [43]. In vivo blockade of the interaction of PD\u20101 with its ligand PD\u2010L1 has been reported to enhance T\u2010cell responses [43]. Reduction of PD\u20101 during the treatment of CHB was shown to correlate with reduction of HBV DNA levels [26]. Given the role of PD\u20101/PD\u2010L1 is an important inhibitory pathway in T\u2010cell function, the effect of telbivudine on the expression of PD\u20101 and PD\u2010L1 was investigated to further define the effect of telbivudine on T\u2010cell response. Although telbivudine does not alter the expression of PD\u20101, of note is that it significantly downregulated PD\u2010L1 expression on T cells in MHV\u20103\u2010infected C3H mice. This result provides initial evidence for a role of telbivudine in this inhibitory pathway in regulating T\u2010cell function that may favour the development of immune clearance of virus infection. However, the effects of telbivudine on PD\u20101 and PD\u2010L1 expression on other cell types should be clarified in further studies. Also, the underlying molecular mechanism requires further investigation. One of the proposed mechanisms is upregulation of the activity of cellular kinases to facilitate efficient phosphorylation. On the other hand, many nucleoside analogue\u2010like substances [e.g. CpG\u2010containing DNA, as found in DNA viruses and bacteria; viral dsRNA; the viral mimic polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (polyI:C)] can exert immunomodulatory activities via toll\u2010like receptors.

This in turn may explain the benefit of telbivudine on the amelioration of MHV\u20103 infection and increased survival as well as improvements in clinical scores and liver histology.

As effector cells, CD8+ T cells (pooled from three mice per experimental group) were obtained from each group. (a) Cytotoxicity to hepatocytes and (b) PD\u20101 and Fas ligand expression on CD8+ T cells were increased in infected groups. There were no differences between the PBS\u2010, lamivudine\u2010 and telbivudine\u2010treated groups. (c) TNFR1, TNFR2, perforin and granzyme B expression on CD8+ T cells were similar in each group. (d) Histograms show PD\u2010L1 expression levels on CD3+ cells from each group. (e) The percentage of PD\u2010L1 expression on CD8+ T cells is shown. The results are a combination of three independent experiments. (d) is representative of three similar experiments. *P < 0.01.",
