In the lung there may be bronchoconstriction or asthma; in the nose, rhinitis; in the skin, urticaria; in the eyes, conjunctivitis. Systemic manifestations of allergy characterize anaphylaxis, which may be life threatening and require immediate medical attention. Anaphylaxis that occurs in conjunction with exercise, termed exercise-induced anaphylaxis, has been reported in certain individuals [10]. In addition to the inflammatory response, allergic disease manifestations have been associated with fatigue [11], depression [12], and decrements in cognition [13]. In fact, epidemiologic evidence suggests that seasonality of even extreme behavioral manifestation, such as suicide, may be associated with allergy [14] or with exposure to seasonal allergens, specifically tree pollen [15].",

When athletes train and compete, often for long durations of time, they make intimate contact with the outdoor elements that are comprised of a host of topographical, seasonal, and climatic components. Exposure to the various elements is magnified by increased ventilation (up to 200 L/min during exercise), which intensifies the contact between the respiratory system and environment, and by inhalation of poor quality and cold air, which often affects those who train year-round in temperate climates [17], [18]. During the winter months, cold air inhalation during exercise exacerbates exercise-induced asthma in people with asthma [19]. Track and field athletes have extensive exposure to various seasonal pollen allergens during the spring (trees), summer (grass), and early fall (ragweed) [20]. Susceptible athletes may develop conjunctival inflammation, rhinitis, or bronchial inflammation as a consequence of these environmental conditions.",

Of 214 Australian Olympic athletes studied during the 2000 Sydney Olympics, which took place during the period of high tree pollen (over 5000 grains per C\u03bcM), a high prevalence of perennial and seasonal allergic disease was reported. Within that group, 56% reported a history of allergic rhinoconjunctivitis, 41% were symptomatic with a positive skin test to a potential allergen, 29% were diagnosed with seasonal allergic rhinoconjunctivitis based on history and skin testing, and 21% suffered from asthma [23]. Before the 2004 Olympics in Athens, Greece, information regarding circulating aeroallergens in neighboring cities was published to attempt to minimize the allergy symptoms and help athletes achieve peak performance. Understandably, the incidence of adverse responses to seasonal allergens is common amongst athletes. Although athletes with allergic diseases have successfully won many Olympic medals, the detrimental contribution of pollutants, allergens, or other environmental factors has occasionally produced severe exacerbations of allergic conditions, warranting medical attention and causing suboptimal performance.",

Rhinitis often causes changes in sleep patterns because of nasal obstruction, rhinorrhea, and sinus pressure that add to tiredness and fatigue and impair athletic performance [18]. Additionally, short bursts of sprinting require nasal breathing for optimal performance [36], implicating nasal obstruction as a deleterious factor in performance. AR has been associated with alteration in central nervous system (CNS) function, which may significantly affect the athlete's ability to perform. Using a standardized computer-based battery of cognitive processing tests, subjects who have AR experienced decrements in reaction time, attention, and vigilance when exposed to pollen [13]. Others associated AR with increased fatigue [11], depression [11], [37], and anxiety in women [38], which all pose a potential hindrance to performance.",

Reichenberg et al [39] has shown activation of the innate immune response in humans by low-dose endotoxin exposure and subsequent release of pro-inflammatory cytokines (eg, IL-1, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1), some of which are also released by IgE-mediated responses in the nasal mucosa (see Fig. 1) [40], [41]. The exposure to endotoxins and secretion of cytokines induced depressive symptoms, anxiety, and cognitive impairment in the absence of constitutional symptoms (eg, decreased energy, anorexia, drowsiness) [39], [42]. Circulating cytokines may also induce activation of the HPA-axis [43], and elevation of corticotrophin-releasing factor (CRF) and cortisol have been shown to contribute to major affective illness [44]. Furthermore, cytokines in the respiratory tract may stimulate specific receptors present in the vagus nerve and affect brain function through this pathway [45]. As such, cytokine release could contribute to decrements in cognition and to the onset or exacerbation of depression or anxiety, thus having detrimental effects on athletic performance.",

            "text": "Beginning with the earliest Olympic games, athletes have enhanced athletic performance through the use of foreign substances. In 1967, the International Olympic Commission developed a list of prohibited methods and substances to protect the health of, and foster equality for, all competing athletes [49]. In the realm of allergic diseases, these restrictions have generated significant challenges. For example, the overall Olympic champion in women's gymnastics at the 2000 Olympics was disqualified and her gold medal withdrawn because she used a medication for AR which contained pseudoephedrine, allegedly without the intent of doping. Pseudoephedrine is no longer on the Prohibited List (Table 2\n). In 1972, the winner of the 400-meter men's Freestyle was disqualified because significant levels of the banned drug ephedrine were detected in his post-race urinalysis. The swimmer had used a combination ephedrine/theophylline preparation for the prerace treatment of his asthma [22]. These examples highlight the importance for athletes, coaches, and team physicians to understand the potential that a particular medication, apparently innocuous, may contain or be contaminated by a particular banned substance. To establish a universal internationally standardized Olympic antidoping code, the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) was established in 1999. The WADA disseminates current information on substances prohibited for use by competitive athletes. WADA maintains and updates the World Anti-Doping Code Prohibited List, which includes substances that are prohibited only during competition, others that are always prohibited, and others that are on the monitoring list (see Table 2). More and current updated information regarding antidoping rules, regulations, and prohibited substance listings can be found at www.wada-ama.org.",

            "text": "Oral decongestants, such as pseudoephedrine and phenylpropanolamine, are effective in reducing nasal congestion from rhinitis, although they can cause insomnia, loss of appetite, and excessive nervousness [3], [50]. These decongestants are no longer on the Prohibited List, but have been placed on the 2005 Monitoring Program to detect patterns of misuse in sports (see Table 2). Topical \u03b1-adrenergic nasal decongestants are commonly used, but may cause rhinitis medicamentosa, the syndrome of rebound nasal congestion, when overused [3]. Antihistamines are commonly used, have long been standard therapy for seasonal and perennial AR, and are effective in relieving symptoms of itching, sneezing and rhinorrhea, and allergic conjunctivitis [6], [51]. The older first-generation antihistamines are significantly limited by their sedative and anticholinergic adverse effects and may compromise important psychomotor skills (eg, reaction time, visual discrimination) [52], and therefore should be avoided. The newer second-generation antihistamines are preferred because of their longer duration of action and minimal, if any, CNS adverse effects [53], [54]. Intranasal steroids are likely the most effective therapy for AR and allergic conjunctivitis. Their efficacy is maximized with continuous use [53], but there are also proven as-need benefits [55]. They have the benefit over antihistamines of down-regulating numerous steps in the inflammatory process, including reducing the release of cytokines and chemokines [56]. Their use in Olympic athletes requires the application for an abbreviated therapeutic use exemption (TUE). Several studies have shown concurrent reduction with use of intranasal corticosteroids in bronchial hyperresponsiveness [5]. Leukotriene modifiers have confirmed benefit in allergic rhinitis comparable to antihistamines [57]. Other effective intranasal agents include intranasal antihistamines, ipratropium bromide, and cromolyn sodium [3]. To date, there have been no published reports of immunotherapy specifically targeting elite athletes [18]. However, allergen immunotherapy significantly decreases the severity of AR, reduces the requirement for pharmacotherapy, and improves quality of life [53].",

Respiratory viral infections (most common), allergens, irritants, drugs, climatic conditions, exercise, and other stimuli can induce asthmatic exacerbations. In a survey of 214 athletes representing 12 Olympic sports, 21% reported having experienced asthma [23]. The reason for the higher prevalence of asthma among athletes is because of their exposure to various climatic conditions (eg, cold in winter), pollen content (eg, grass, weed, trees), and various pathophysiologic changes that occur during exercise that may promote bronchial hyperresponsiveness [17], [19], [58], [59], [60], [61], [62], [63]. When strenuous exercise results in resistance to airflow, the phenomenon is called exercise-induced bronchospasm or exercise-induced asthma (EIA) [19].",

The generally accepted pathogenesis of EIA involves the loss of heat and water from airway mucosa [59], [64], [65], [66]. During exercise and increased respiratory rate, large volumes of dry, cold air reduce airway cooling as it travels along the tracheobronchial tree, which may cause bronchial constriction through a reflex stimulation of airway receptors. This response may lead to changes in mucosal osmolarity and promote mast cell degranulation, consequently furthering bronchoconstriction [67]. Rapid airway rewarming after exercise may cause vascular congestion, increased permeability, and edema, leading to obstruction [19], [68].",

Inhaled corticosteroids may be helpful in reducing bronchial hyperresponsiveness when used for their long-term antiinflammatory effects. Theophylline preparations and anticholinergics are used as tertiary agents when other agents are proven ineffective. However, the requirement for blood-level monitoring of a narrow therapeutic window makes theophylline a less desirable alternative agent for athletes [61]. Short-acting \u03b22 agonists are considered first-line therapy and provide protection in 80% to 90% of subjects with minimal adverse effects [81], [82]. Long-acting \u03b22 agonists can prevent bronchial obstruction for 10 to 12 hours [83] and provide athlete with a full day of protection. Formoterol, salbutamol, salmeterol, and terbutaline are permitted by inhalation with the completion of an abbreviated TUE, but all other \u03b22 agonists, including their D- and L-isomers are prohibited in and out of competition, according to the 2005 Prohibited List (see Table 2).
