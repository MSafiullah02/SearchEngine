Previous studies in dual-coding learning theory have demonstrated when educational content is presented to both pathways concurrently, as in VBE, learners have a higher likelihood of recall.4 This platform is particularly useful for operative case preparation, especially in the setting of a pandemic where limited surgical cases are proceeding.",

Instead, preexisting operative video libraries could be utilized to supplement resident education. Two examples of peer-reviewed libraries with VBE operative content include the Journal of Medical Insight (JOMI) and the American College of Surgeons (ACS) Online Video Library. Our institution is further answering this call, by creating an open-access, peer-reviewed video library available to all learners world-wide. This free resource, MGH SurgEdOnline, will be available in the next couple of months. These resources instruct residents on proper surgical indications, preoperative workup, and operative anatomy and techniques. With COVID-19 limitations on elective cases and acute care surgical management, the videos offer an educational alternative that can be safely watched from a learner's home or call room. Multi-institutional collaborations can alleviate the administrative burdens and costs associated with video production and increase residents\u2019 access to educational material that transcends traditional institution silos.",

There also may be a desire to cultivate camaraderie and connection during the changing clinical atmosphere. By offering virtual lectures through a video-based conferencing platform, such as ZOOM (Zoom Video Communications, Inc, San Jose, CA), trainees can continue to \u201cmeet\u201d regularly and learn from local lecturers. Video-based conferencing platforms offer lecturers the ability to screen share their slides in real time, as well as a recording option for viewing outside of the scheduled didactic hours. This permits flexible learning and allows didactic lectures to transcend traditional residency schedules and clinical rotation site limitations. This technique also provides an opportunity for multi-institutional surgical education collaborations. Programs can share live or recorded virtual lecture content across multiple institutions to distribute their teaching and content expertise nationally. Surgical residencies have varying sizes and resources, and this virtual platform can facilitate the distribution of educational content to under resourced residency programs and those programs most disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic. This software may also offer a solution to the problem of educational conference continuity when trainees are on off-site rotations beyond the COVID-19 era.",

This waiting period contains a surgeon's most valuable resource: time. Trainees can use this time to reflect on their personal learning methodologies, establish a goal, such as improved in-service examination performance or developing a deeper understanding of a certain topic, and then utilize multiple resources and principles of adult learning theory, such as spaced repetition, to achieve that goal.6 Tangible, measurable goals will allow for improved self-regulated learning. Trainees can use in-service review materials such as SCORE, TrueLearn, or ABSITE Quest (free 1-year subscription for e-learning during the COVID pandemic), textbooks, online review articles, and previously described virtual educational modules.",

National societies, including American Society of Transplant Surgeons, Society of Critical Care Medicine, Society of Surgical Oncology, Society of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons, and others, have created online repositories of relevant resources related to their areas of expertise that include surgical topics and COVID-19-specific resources. Podcasts, such as Behind The Knife and Audible Bleeding, provide another avenue to engage millennial learners with educational content. Although podcasts are an easy-to-access supplemental resource for this remote learning era, there is little formal evidence to support their use as a standalone teaching method.7 Thus, we also recommend offering VBE resources, which can review operative content and high-yield didactic material. One open-access resource, following the weekly SCORE curriculum, is SurgEdVidz, which is available via Twitter(R) or YouTube(R).",

Models and instruments, such as suturing kits with felt or silicone \u201ctissue\u201d or FLS box trainers, can be borrowed for technical practice.

For lectures delivered through an online platform, it is important to select clearly defined learning objectives for each session as opposed to covering vast amounts of material during the designated session. Additionally, PowerPoint slides should be created based on proven principles of multimedia design to enhance understanding and promote knowledge retention. Slides should be formatted to reduce extraneous processing, manage essential processing, and foster generative processing, aligning with Mayer's principles of multimedia design.10 One of the challenges educators face with virtual education is promoting active participation from a remote site, which is known to improve performance. Utilization of online audience response systems and small group-based learning, such as through ZOOM breakout rooms, provides a means for not only engaging learners remotely, but also providing instructors an opportunity to assess content understanding and knowledge deficits.",

These flexible recommendations allow surgical residency programs the opportunity to maintain a rigorous educational experience despite the limitations imposed by COVID-19.
