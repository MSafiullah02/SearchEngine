As of 12 th May 2020, there have been a total of 4,013,728 reported infected cases worldwide with 278,993 deaths [2] . Another long-standing global epidemic is diabetes that was reported to affect 463 million adults (20 -79 years) in 2019, which accounts for 9.3% of the world's population in this age group [3] . The global health expenditure in 2019 for this chronic disease was estimated to be 760 billion dollars and resulted in an estimated 4.2 million deaths during the same year [3] . Individuals with diabetes have been identified to have worse outcomes when infected by COVID-19 [2, 4, 5] . In fact, individuals with diabetes who get infected with COVID-19 were reported to have higher non-survival prevalence (ranging between 22 to 31%) compared to the non-diabetes subgroup [6] . The global focus has been to control the pandemic outbreak while trying to protect the general population. Individuals with diabetes have been declared as being a vulnerable group. The aim of this review is to provide a comprehensive summary of the emerging information (up till time of writing) on individuals with diabetes and COVID-19, why individuals with diabetes are considered as vulnerable and what measures have been recommended for this population to date.",

As part of the pathophysiology of diabetes, especially those with an uncontrolled glycaemic status, the innate immune system and humoral immunity are compromised [10] . This makes the first line defence against any infection, including SARS-CoV-2 inefficient. Diabetes also causes a pro-inflammatory state with an exaggerated cytokine response. It has been reported that individuals with diabetes infected by COVID-19 had significantly increased levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and C-reactive protein (CRP) compared to those without diabetes [11] . The entry of SARS-CoV-2 within the host cell triggers an inflammatory response, recruitment of T helper cells with the production of interferon gamma leading to a cytokine storm [6] . Hence, considering the cellular mechanisms triggered by COVID-19 and the pathophysiology of diabetes, individuals with diabetes are more susceptible to a cytokine storm with potential organ damage if infected by COVID-19.",

This corresponds to the diabetes pathological mechanism where the hyperglycaemic state of the individual increases the virulence of the pathogens, lowers the interleukins production in response to infection as well as reduces the phagocytic activity and polymorphonuclear leukocytes [15] . Type 1 diabetes individuals are at high risk of developing diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) when acquiring an infection, which causes additional metabolic complications in these individuals. It has also been reported that the hyperglycaemic levels will directly increase the concentration of glucose within the airway secretion [16] . This is apart from the fact that diabetes is associated with pulmonary structural changes [17] .",

This is an enzyme found in multiple organs including the lungs, pancreas, kidneys, vascular system and intestinal endothelium. In normal physiology, ACE2 plays an important role in anti-inflammation and anti-oxidation. It is responsible for the degradation of angiotensin-II as well as angiotensin I (to a lesser extent) to smaller peptides, namely angiotensin (1-7) and angiotensin 1-9 respectively. The former peptide (angiotensin 1-7) is responsible for the antiinflammatory and antioxidant role. This process is compromised as part of the diabetes pathophysiology. This makes individuals with diabetes at increased risk of severe lung injury as well as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) if infected by COVID-19 [18] . COVID-19 has envelope with spike glycoprotein that helps the virus to enter human cells (through angiotension-converting enzyme 2 -ACE2) as well as is responsible for host-tohost transmission [19] . Hence, it was postulated that in severe COVID-19 infections there may be an imbalance in the ACE2 activation pathways with an increase in the proinflammatory response as a consequence of increase in angiotensin II levels and a decrease in angiotensin 1-7 levels [20, 21] .",

So, the entry of the coronavirus into the pancreatic islets may cause an acute beta-cell dysfunction with a resultant acute hyperglycaemic state [22] . Hence, individuals with diabetes are vulnerable to COVID-19 infection leading to an uncontrolled hyperglycaemic status. In fact, it was reported that in-patients with diabetes and infected by COVID-19 in Wuhan medical centre, had uncontrolled hyperglycaemic states even when following the recommended blood glucose management strategies by the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and American Diabetes Associations. Such uncontrolled glucose levels predispose these individuals with diabetes and infected with COVID-19 to secondary infections as well as increase in mortality risks [23] . Although a number of potential limitations in Wuhan healthcare system were noted by the authors, they suggested that the blood glucose management strategies for COVID-19 positive patients with diabetes should be optimized [24] . Such experience along with the pathophysiology of COVID-19 in individuals with diabetes is of significant clinical importance to caring physicians. This suggests that it is mandatory that patients with diabetes and COVID-19 should have optimal metabolic control. It has been suggested that the antidiabetic GLP1 agonists medication that acts on the ACE2 and Mas receptor pathways may not only help control the blood glucose levels but also prevent coronavirus from entering the cells due to competitive binding to ACE2 [25] .",

            "text": "Metformin is the first-line treatment option of type 2 diabetes. It is responsible for the activation of the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in the liver [26] . Historically, metformin was initially produced as an anti-influenza drug and its well-known glucose lowering ability was actually a side effect [27] . It has been postulated that metformin may have an advantageous role in this pandemic. The activation of AMPK by metformin leads to phosphorylation of ACE2 which can lead to functional changes to this receptor [28] . Such changes may decrease the binding of SARS-CoV-2. It has been reported that if the virus enters into the host cells through ACE2, it creates an imbalance of the renin-angiotensinaldosterone system with downregulation of ACE2 receptors. However, metformin prevents this detrimental sequence by activation of ACE2 through the AMPK-signalling pathway [29] . Therefore, one can postulate that there is no contraindication for the intake of metformin if an individual with diabetes gets infected by COVID-19. On the contrary it might be beneficial to these individuals during this pandemic.",

Such roles have an additional benefit during this pandemic, where it is reported that individuals suffering from any of the aforementioned diseases have a worse prognosis if infected by COVID-19 [30] . Additionally, GLP-1Ra also has anti-inflammatory and anti-adipogenic effects with insulin resistance antagonism [31] . However, considering that both GLP-1Ra and SGLT-2 inhibitors may induce ACE2 receptor over-expression [32] , these drugs may have more serious consequences if individuals with diabetes acquire COVID-19. More data and clinical studies are required to ascertain such a relationship. Of note, in those not infected by COVID-19 but on SGLT-2 inhibitors, an increased risk of diabetes ketoacidosis (DKA) has been observed. This will further complicate the clinical scenario should they acquire the virus [33] . Similarly, individuals with type 1 diabetes on SGLT2 inhibitors and infected by COVID-19 have been observed to experience severe DKA [34] . It has been recommended that individuals with diabetes infected by COVID-19 should have their SGLT2 inhibitors discontinued as a precaution against potential acute metabolic decompensation [34] .",

These are associated with an increased ACE2 expression with a counteractive response to the elevated levels of angiotensin-II. The ARBs have pleiotropic effects beyond controlling hypertension. They have anti-inflammatory effects, reduce endothelial injury and organ fibrosis, maintain insulin sensitivity as well as energy metabolism. Additionally, ARBs have a protective effect on lipid metabolism and normalise the coagulation cascade [39, 40] . It has also been reported that ARBs protect the lungs from severe endothelial injury associated with pneumonia, influenza and sepsis [41] . During this pandemic there have been reports that individuals with diabetes on ACE inhibitors (ACEi) are at an increased susceptibility to COVID-19 [18, 42] . It has been postulated that when SARS-CoV-2 uses ACE2 as a host receptor, the ACE2 gets downregulated and compromises its protection to the lung tissue from injury [18] . However, there is lack of robust data and evidence on this malice relationship. In fact, the Council on Hypertension of the European Society of Cardiology, along with a consortium between the American Heart Association, the Heart Failure Society of America and the American College of Cardiology, all recommended that physicians should continue the treatment and any medication changes should only be done after careful assessment. This is especially so, when considering that ARBs have a number of protective effects [43] [44] [45] . It has been noted that those infected with COVID-19 had hypokalaemia, which has been linked with the downregulation effect of ACE2 within the lungs [18] . This causes a reduction in angiotensin-II degradation with a consequential increased secretion of aldosterone. The presence of hypokalaemia can worsen the glycaemic control in both individuals with type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus [46] .",

Diabetes distress is associated with a worse metabolic profile including higher glycated haemoglobin, higher body mass index, higher diastolic blood pressure and low-density cholesterol (LDL-C). These can contribute towards diabetes related complications. This is also associated with poorer diet quality and low social support [56, 57] . With the COVID-19 pandemic and the implemented lockdown, the population with diabetes is more prone to worsening of the diabetes distress. The COVID-19 stressful period may decrease the quality of life of the individuals with diabetes as well as affect the glucose self-management [58] . Hence, additional psychological aid and support is of utmost importance during this pandemic.",

However, it is important to advocate further measures that are specific to the diabetes population to avoid this vulnerable population from developing unwanted complications. This ensures safeguarding the demands on the healthcare system, especially at this time of crisis. It is important to note that although lockdowns and advocacy to stay at home are an essential part of COVID-19 pandemic containment measures, these may have negative consequences on individuals with diabetes.

If uncontrolled glycaemic levels are present, then self-monitoring should be done more frequently. Individuals with type 1 diabetes with uncontrolled glycaemic levels should check their glucose levels at least four times a day (fasting, before lunch, before dinner and at bedtime).

Many governments have now restricted movement of their citizens and confined them to the home environment, hence public physical activity facilities have been closed. However, a number of different organizations and entities have set up online physical activity video routines that could be followed at home. Some countries are also broadcasting a daily exercise routine for their viewers to follow. Individuals with diabetes are recommended to follow such exercise programmes however the exercise intensity should be tailored to the individual's capacity to exercise. Another important factor is for individuals with diabetes to adhere to a regular well-balanced diet. A healthy diet should consist of protein, fiber, vitamins and limited saturated fats. In this time of lockdown, acquiring fresh fruit and vegetables may be a challenge however there are companies that are delivering such fresh foods directly to residents' homes. Unfortunately, during this stressful time of the pandemic, an individual may opt for inappropriate stress eating habits, with a tendency towards packed high fat, sugar and salt content foods. Such food along with lack of physical activity is the recipe for dysregulation of the blood glucose levels, hyperosmolar coma, ketoacidosis, predisposition to infections as well as acute cardiac events in individuals with diabetes [6] . A number of doctors have set up telemedicine as an exchange for their normal consultation practices. Through the means of telemedicine, individuals with diabetes can remain in constant contact with their physician for treatment advise and management of their glucose levels [34] .",
