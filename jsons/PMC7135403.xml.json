A decreased capillary refill time, tachycardia, and tachypnea may be present. A fever may or may not be present. As sepsis progresses, the foal becomes progressively more depressed or obtunded. Poor cardiac output results in cool extremities, tachycardia, prolonged capillary refill time, and poor peripheral pulses. Hypothermia and hypoglycemia may develop.

Hypoxia may occur during pregnancy, parturition, or immediately after foaling. Decreased energy supply results in loss of membrane pumps, loss of ion gradients, calcium influx, activation of calcium-dependent enzymes and cellular damage.3 Subsequent reperfusion can result in further damage via production of reactive oxygen species and inflammatory changes. Foals affected with PAS may be normal at birth and gradually become disinterested in their dams as cerebral swelling and cellular injury progresses. They may lose their suckle reflex and become excessively sleepy and difficult to rouse. Severe cases may become recumbent, progress to seizures, and develop an abnormal, apneustic pattern of breathing. Gastrointestinal signs may vary from mild feed intolerance to colic, gas distension, and bloody diarrhea. Many affected foals fail to urinate in response to bladder distension and require catheterization of the bladder to prevent rupture. Additional clinical signs will vary depending on organ system dysfunction.",
