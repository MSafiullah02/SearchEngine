These include entry into host cells, subsequent, at least partial, disassembly to allow for replication of their genetic material, followed by assembly of progeny virus particles, and finally escape of these progeny from the host cell. Despite the similarity of these overall processes, there is a vast range of distinct molecular mechanisms that underlie the specifics of each step that are virus and host\u2010dependent. In composition, viruses are much simpler than their hosts and exploit the cellular machinery of those hosts to complete their lifecycles. The study of viruses has, therefore, been fundamental to our understanding of modern cell biology, as well as being vital for the design of therapeutic or preventative strategies against viral diseases.",

The latter can be either DNA or RNA, which in turn can be either single\u2010stranded or double\u2010stranded, and present as single or multiple molecules. This basic structural description, however, can be misleading because viral lifecycles can only be completed by a co\u2010ordinated series of highly dynamic molecular events. Viruses are more accurately described as nanoscale macromolecular machines that have evolved in the highly unforgiving Darwinian world where the better machines flourish whereas those that perform less well \u201cdie out.\u201d Thus, the viruses we see around us are the products of extensive molecular refinement, containing some of the most exquisite molecular machinery known. They are also, despite their scale and total dependence on their hosts, the most successful organisms on the planet in terms of their numbers. Bacteriophages, viruses that grow in bacteria, are the most successful of all viruses, due to the fact that their hosts include cyanobacteria and algae, which exist in coastal sea water at a level of many millions per milliliter and each host cell can be used to generate tens of thousands of phage particles (Hendrix et al., 1999).",

Indeed, it was Crick and Watson (1956) who realized that there was a basic problem to be overcome by virus particles. Each amino acid of a coat protein subunit must be encoded by a three nucleotide codon in a messenger RNA (mRNA). Since the largest amino acid, tryptophan, has a molecular weight of 204 Da whereas that of the codon specifying it is \u223c1,000 Da, it is immediately clear that it is impossible to construct a shell from a single giant polypeptide that can enclose the genome that encoded it. Instead, it was proposed that capsid shells were composed of multiple copies of one or very few coat proteins; that structure implied they would be highly symmetrical.",

The roles of symmetry in viral architecture were explored systematically with the result that the inherent efficiency of helical and icosahedral designs, which allow the largest number of small coat protein subunits and hence the least amount of nucleic acid, to enclose the largest volumes, was recognized (Caspar & Klug, 1962). This concept became known as genetic economy; namely, that viruses will respond to the selective pressure to minimize the amount of their respective genomes dedicated to production of their capsids, whilst at the same time trying to maximize that capsid's volume, to allow encapsidation of more viral genes dedicated to replication within the host. For icosahedral viruses, such arguments lead to a capsid composed of 60 coat protein subunits. In fact, most spherical viruses have more than 60 subunits, and this observation was explained via the concept of quasi\u2010equivalence (Caspar & Klug, 1962) (Fig. 1) in which sub\u2010triangulation of the facets of an icosahedron can be used to predict \u201callowed\u201d coat protein stoichiometries.",

            "text": "This idea of quasi\u2010equivalence has proven central to all subsequent structural studies of viruses and was given molecular detail in 1977 when Harrison's group described the atomic structure of TBSV, an example of a T = 3 capsid that contains 180 copies of a single type of coat protein subunit packaged as 90 non\u2010covalently bound dimers (Winkler et al., 1977). Conformational changes between coat protein domains were seen that allowed these proteins to adopt different structures at defined symmetry contexts within the protein shell. Subsequent structural studies showed these conformational changes to be a common feature of these types of viruses (Suck et al., 1978; Liddington et al., 1991). These ideas saw minor revision with the realization that some animal viruses can be even more efficient in creating capsids that disobey quasi\u2010equivalence by being built solely out of pentameric aggregates (Rayment et al., 1982; Liddington et al., 1991). Subsequent progress has been very rapid, and a number of X\u2010ray crystal structures at atomic resolution have been reported for membrane\u2010containing viruses (Grimes et al., 1998; Cockburn et al., 2004). Modern techniques, such as cryo\u2010electron microscopy (cryo\u2010EM), have allowed us to investigate the dynamical aspects of much more complex viral machines, including specialized appendages for injection of the genome into target cells (Gan et al., 2006; Lander et al., 2006).",

            "text": "Although work on the structures of many important viruses is now very advanced, the same can not be said of a number of critical questions with respect to the formation of these viral machines. Understanding how such machines are assembled is vital because the assembly pathways offer unique drug targets for anti\u2010viral therapy. In recent years, established and novel emerging viruses have posed increasing threats to public health. Effective vaccines and anti\u2010viral drugs are unavailable for the majority of these viruses, whilst those drugs that are available target viral replication, maturation, or receptor attachment but not yet assembly/disassembly or genome packaging. Many viruses have been successfully targeted by RNA interference (RNAi), a conserved sequence\u2010specific, gene\u2010silencing mechanism that is induced by double\u2010stranded RNA and can trigger inhibition of virus replication, including important human pathogens such as human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV\u20101), hepatitis C virus (HCV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS\u2010CoV), and influenza virus (Haasnoot, Westerhout, & Berkhout, 2007). Monoclonal antibody therapeutics can also inhibit viral infection by targeting the steps that viruses take to enter into cells (Marasco & Sui, 2007). Interfering with capsid assembly and stability is potentially a powerful target for anti\u2010viral therapeutics. For example, the low molecular weight hydrophobic dye 1,1\u2032\u2010bis(4\u2010anilino)naphthalene\u20105,5\u2032\u2010disulfonic acid (bis\u2010ANS) has been shown to bind dimers of the HBV capsid protein with a 1:1 stoichiometry to inhibit capsid assembly (Zlotnick & Stray, 2003). Another example of this type of anti\u2010viral activity is the use of the tripeptide Cys\u2010Pro\u2010Gly\u2010NH2, which is thought to target viral assembly or maturation in HIV\u20101 (Miller & Hazuda, 2001). A family of small\u2010molecule drugs, the WIN compounds, have been identified that bind to surface \u201cpockets\u201d on the coat proteins of rhinovirus capsids and other members of the picornavirus family. This binding results in stabilization of the viral capsids and inhibition of viral disassembly/uncoating (Hadfield, Diana, & Rossman, 1999). However, widespread use of such anti\u2010virals is prevented by our lack of understanding of the assembly process.",

The detailed molecular mechanisms that underlie these fascinating in vitro self\u2010assembly reactions have been difficult to investigate because intermediates on the assembly pathways are present in limited amounts and are transient. It is, however, in these aspects of viral structure and function that non\u2010covalent mass spectrometry (MS) has begun to make a major impact and is the subject of this review. The ability to understand the structure, assembly, and dynamics of viruses also promises to further their use in nanotechnology: a variety of viruses has now been developed for such applications which include biomaterials, vaccines, chemical tools, imaging, and molecular electronic materials (reviewed in Singh, Gonzalez, and Manchester (2006)). Viral DNA packaging motors also have potential nanotechnological applications, including the delivery of drugs or therapeutic DNA or RNA, tissue and organ repair, the diagnosis of diseases, and the detection of pathogens (Guo & Lee, 2007).",

For X\u2010ray diffraction studies, the protein must be amenable to crystallization, whereas NMR is limited to soluble proteins of relatively low molecular mass. Cryo\u2010EM has begun to solve some of these problems by allowing 3\u2010D image reconstruction of small amounts of macromolecular complexes in vitreous ice at near\u2010native conditions. In this way, functional dynamics as well as structures at moderate resolution can be investigated. Indeed, for viruses there is a pleasingly strong correlation between molecular features at moderate resolution in the cryo\u2010EM and high\u2010resolution structures from X\u2010ray research work. Cryo\u2010EM, however, lacks precise molecular information and here MS can provide unique insights.",

One significant advantage of MS over other techniques is that relatively tiny volumes of material are required, often only at micromolar concentrations; another is the speed of the analysis, which can take just a few minutes. Also of importance is the fact that MS has the capability to monitor macromolecular reactions on\u2010line, in real\u2010time, making it ideal to follow biomolecular assembly pathways and to observe changes in protein structure. Hence, MS is proving to be an important and informative technique to monitor virus capsid assembly in real\u2010time as well as disassembly achieved by perturbation of solution or instrument conditions. The detectable mass range in modern instruments, which now exceeds several million Daltons, allows the mass analysis of large, biomolecular assemblies, including intact viruses.",

            "text": "These significant recent advances have been made possible by the emergence of techniques such as electrospray ionization (ESI; Fenn et al., 1989) and the associated development of nano\u2010ESI (Wilm & Mann, 1994), together with matrix\u2010assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI; Karas & Hillenkamp, 1988; Tanaka et al., 1988), which rapidly made MS amenable for the routine mass analysis of large biomolecules such as proteins. Even from the early days, reports quickly emerged whereby the boundaries of these techniques, in particular ESI\u2010MS, were being extended from simply measuring the molecular mass of a protein to the characterization of proteins in their native conformations, either alone or non\u2010covalently bound to other proteins, metals, or small ligand molecules (Chowdhury, Katta, & Chait, 1990; Ganem, Li, & Henion, 1991; Katta & Chait, 1991). In such analyses, the molecules of interest are subjected to ESI from an aqueous solution of a volatile buffer such as ammonium acetate. Careful desolvation of the protein assembly within the ion source generates multiply charged ions of the intact complex for analysis by MS. Thus, it became possible to obtain accurate information concerning not only the mass of the protein complex, but also important details about its stoichiometry, stability, and dynamics. However, such non\u2010covalent analyses are not trivial to perform. As they are carried out under near\u2010physiological conditions at neutral pH, they tend to suffer from low ionization yields, which result not only in weak signals (in mass spectrometric terms), but also in high mass\u2010to\u2010charge (m/z) ratio ions that require instrumentation with higher m/z ranges. The presence of varying quantities of salt and buffer ions specifically and non\u2010specifically bound within the 3\u2010D architecture of such complexes gives rise to broad, heterogeneous signals for which mass measurements can be challenging to deduce accurately, and this broadening is particularly apparent in the case of protein\u2013polynucleotide interactions, where non\u2010specific cation binding to nucleic acids is to be expected (Hanson & Robinson, 2004).",

This \u201ccooling\u201d ensures that large, fragile ions remain sufficiently stable to traverse the mass spectrometer and reach the detector intact, thus avoiding dissociation into the individual biomolecular components (van Berkel et al., 2000; Sobott et al., 2002).",

            "text": "A pertinent starting point for this review is the key result published by Siuzdak in 1996 (Siuzdak, 1996). This study showed, for the first time, that it was possible to preserve the native conformation and activity of non\u2010covalently bound viral particles throughout an entire mass spectrometric analysis. This finding was a major milestone for virologists and mass spectrometrists alike, and paved the way for subsequent mass spectrometric research on a variety of viruses. Although early ESI\u2010MS studies had shown that non\u2010covalent interactions could be maintained during the ionization and m/z analysis processes of proteins (Chowdhury, Katta, & Chait, 1990), the investigation of supramolecular complexes was severely limited by the m/z ranges available on the instruments of that time. However, using an ESI\u2010triple quadrupole mass spectrometer with an upper m/z limit of only 2300, Siuzdak (1996) successfully ionized two viruses, rice yellow mottle virus (RYMV) and tobacco mosaic virus (TMV), which had been chosen for their contrasting viral structures (Table 1). RYMV is a single\u2010stranded RNA virus with an icosahedral capsid, \u223c29 nm in diameter, comprised of 180 copies of a coat protein monomer with a total mass of 6.2 MDa; TMV is also a single\u2010stranded RNA virus, consisting of \u223c2,140 identical protein subunits that form a rod\u2010shaped helical capsid of diameter 17.5 nm and length 300 nm with a mass of 40.5 MDa (Bhyravbhatla, Watowich, & Caspar, 1998). For this experiment, a glycerol\u2010coated brass plate was fitted within the instrument to act as an ion collector between the second and third quadrupoles. With all of the quadrupoles operating in non\u2010analyzing Rf mode only, the virus\u2010related ions were transmitted through the first and second quadrupoles, and collected on the inserted brass plate. This plate was subsequently removed from the instrument and when the two collected viruses were examined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), both were found to have retained their distinctive morphologies. Furthermore, the viability of the TMV species was established by showing retention of infectivity. These data provided the first direct observation that the biological activity of a supramolecular complex could be preserved throughout the ESI\u2010MS process, and specifically that viral structure and activity could be retained after subjection to ionization, high vacuum conditions, and finally impact on a collector plate. Although the m/z ions generated were much too high for a mass analysis to be performed on this particular instrument, the vital proof that such complexes could survive this type of experiment had been obtained, and from this result the implication that MS was indeed a viable and important technique for the investigation of virus architecture.",

Thus, in 2000 the mass of the bacteriophage MS2 capsid, a T = 3 icosahedral virus consisting of 180 copies of a single coat protein (13.7 kDa) and of total mass 2.5 MDa, which forms a shell around a single\u2010stranded RNA molecule, was measured with an error of only \u00b11% (Tito et al., 2000; Fig. 2). The fact that the observed mass was 0.55% higher than the actual mass was accounted for by the ambiguity in the assignment of the barely separated, broad peaks associated with the observed charge states (n = 101\u2013124, m/z 20,000\u201324,000, where m/z = [M + nH\n+]/n) and also to the propensity of small molecules and counterions to remain bound to protein assemblies to increase their observed mass.

            "text": "An alternative approach to conventional m/z analysis for the mass analysis of intact viral capsids is the use of charge\u2010detection mass spectrometry, a technique that involves simultaneous measurements of charge and m/z for individual ions, and which is especially useful in the case of samples that generate high charge states, which are difficult to assign unambiguously (Smith, Cheng, & Bruce, 1994; Benner, 1997; Schultz, Hack, & Benner, 1998, 1999; Fuerstenau et al., 2001). Employing ESI as the first stage in the analysis, this approach has been used with Tof (Benner, 1997) and Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FT\u2010ICR; Smith, Cheng, & Bruce, 1994) m/z analyzers. After the ESI process, the virus ions pass through a metal flight tube attached to a charge\u2010sensitive pre\u2010amplifier that captures their image current, the magnitude of which is proportional to their charge. The m/z ratio is measured by the analyzer of the mass spectrometer, and from this combination of charge and m/z, the mass of each ion can be deduced. The measurements of RYMV and TMV have been reported by Suizdak et al., using this methodology coupled to a Tof mass analyzer (Fuerstenau et al., 2001), following on from their early pioneering studies with the same two viruses. In their experiment, thousands of individual ions were measured and charge\u2010state distributions were obtained. The charge\u2010state distribution of large particles depends on particle shape, together with the pH and solvent used for the ESI process. The RYMV and TMV ions each possessed a charge distribution of between 300 and 1,000 positive unit charges, with higher charge states also being observed for TMV. From these distributions, masses of 6\u20137 MDa and 39\u201342 MDa for RYMV and TMV, respectively, were calculated (Fig. 3). These observed masses are within \u00b115% of the calculated masses (6.5 and 40.5 MDa, respectively), and instrumental improvements were suggested by the authors to better these values.",

As the ESI\u2010MS spectra of large protein complexes can be difficult to interpret due to the presence of many, often partially resolved, multiply charged ions, charge reduction of these species to generate singly charged molecular ions provides a means to simplify such spectra. GEMMA, which provides molecular size information rather than a direct mass measurement, works on the principle whereby multiply charged ions generated by ESI are transformed by a bipolar neutralizer into singly charged molecular ions that are subsequently separated according to their electrophoretic mobility as they pass through a differential mobility analyzer. The electrophoretic mobility diameter is defined as the diameter of a singly charged sphere with the same electrophoretic mobility as the particle. Depending on the applied air flow rate and voltage in this region, ions with a certain mobility leave the differential mobility analyzer and are detected by a condensation particle counter. Finally, the number of detected ions is plotted against the inverse electrophoretic mobility, and this plot is transformed into a GEMMA spectrum, which shows the concentration of charged particles as a function of their calculated electrophoretic mobility diameters.",

Analysis of an intact preparation of HRV2 gave rise to a spectrum that showed a broad peak with an electrophoretic mobility diameter of 29.8 \u00b1 0.3 nm (Bacher et al., 2001), consistent with the value of \u223c30 nm obtained from cryo\u2010EM images (Hewat & Blaas, 1996). The molecular mass of HRV2 was estimated from the measured electrophoretic mobility diameter to be \u223c5.20 MDa, rather lower than the calculated mass of \u223c8.08 MDa based on the known building blocks. Two explanations were proposed for this discrepancy: one was that the density of single\u2010stranded RNA and of the space between RNA and the capsid protein shell are different from the density of the protein alone (on which the calibration was based), and secondly that the nearest calibration point to convert electrophoretic mobility data to molecular mass was that of a protein of mass <2 MDa. Experiments with HRV14 gave similar results. The broadness and hence heterogeneity of the peaks, a familiar phenomenon of macromolecular complexes, was attributed again to the binding of small molecules such as water and buffer.",

The calculated diameters of RYMV, MS2, and CPMV were within 15% of the values obtained from X\u2010ray crystallography, but in each case were consistently smaller. For example, RYMV gave a spectrum that corresponded to a diameter of 28.5 nm, slightly smaller than the diameter calculated from the crystal structure (29\u201332.2 nm), and the observed value for CPMV was 25.9 nm diameter compared with the 28\u201332 nm measured from X\u2010ray crystallography data. These discrepancies were suggested to be due to the removal during the ESI\u2010GEMMA analysis of most of the water molecules that are associated with the virus ensembles, which would result in an overall compaction of the macromolecular structure due to the loss of these water molecules from the protein\u2013protein and protein\u2013nucleic acid interfaces.

The lengths of T2 and T4 are >210 nm, and thus as they are larger than most of the droplets produced by the ESI used in these experiments, the authors gave this reason to explain the fact that intact capsids could not be detected in either of these cases, but rather that virus fragmentation was observed (Hogan et al., 2006).

Double\u2010stranded DNA viruses rely on an active packaging mechanism for encapsidation of their genomes, in which a molecular motor forces genomic DNA into a pre\u2010formed icosahedral procapsid. The packaging motors consist of at least two parts, the terminase (or ATPase) complex and the connector or portal complex. The portal motor complex replaces the normal capsid coat proteins at one of the fivefold vertices of the procapsid. In \u03a629, which has one of the strongest molecular motors known to date, virally encoded RNA molecules are also involved in this process. The action of the packaging motor results in the compaction of double\u2010stranded DNA to almost crystalline density (Smith et al., 2001). The origin of force generation in these systems has long remained a mystery. Almost 30 years ago, Hendrix proposed that symmetry mismatching between a portal complex with sixfold symmetry and the procapsid with local fivefold symmetry would allow a Brownian ratchet type of mechanism to occur (Hendrix, 1978). The implication of this model is that rotation of the portal with respect to the procapsid must occur, although to date no one has demonstrated such movement. A second inference is that the protein stoichiometries of the portal complexes must be very tightly regulated to ensure the symmetry mismatching. More recently, conformational change in motor components has been suggested as an alternative model of motor function (Hugel et al., 2007; Robinson et al., 2006). Understanding the assembly of the portal complex and its role(s) in DNA packaging has therefore been a major goal of structural virology.",

Heck and co\u2010workers have recently used ESI\u2010MS to determine and semi\u2010quantify the oligomeric states of in vitro reconstituted phage portals. Their findings showed conclusively that the isolated portals of the bacteriophages \u03a629, SPP1, and P22 consist of 12\u2010mers, 13\u2010mers, and a mixture of 11\u2010 and 12\u2010mers, respectively.

The complexity of the m/z spectra obtained and the need for sophisticated data interpretation are illustrated with the P22 portal data shown in Figure 5.

The X\u2010ray structure of Q\u03b2 at 3.5 \u00c5 resolution suggested that two cysteine residues within loops of neighboring coat protein subunits were sufficiently close to form inter\u2010molecular disulfide bridges at the capsid five\u2010 and threefold axes (Golmohammadi et al., 1996). These interactions were investigated by ESI\u2010MS (Ashcroft et al., 2005b). Analysis of Q\u03b2 capsids under neutral solvent conditions after disulfide bridge reduction showed the existence only of coat protein dimers, the expected capsomer (principal building block) in these systems; subsequent denaturation led to the detection of protein monomers (14,123 kDa). However, disassembly of the intact capsids led to an ESI\u2010MS spectrum that indicated the presence of protein pentamers and, to a much lesser extent, hexamers; disulfide bridge reduction of this mixture again led to monomer detection. Thus, MS suggests that a contributing factor to the stability of Q\u03b2 capsids is the formation of inter\u2010molecular, disulfide linkages at the fivefold axes that lead to five covalently coupled monomers. The low yield of similarly linked hexamers suggests that the orientation of the cysteines at the particle threefold axes is non\u2010ideal for disulfide bond formation.

RNA\u2010free 14N\u2010CP2 was added to initiate the 2:1 reaction. Immediately, the ESI\u2010MS spectrum indicated two peaks of approximately equivalent intensity that corresponded to either all 14N or all 15N\u2010labeled CP2:TR, but with no evidence for a heterodimer complex; those data indicated that, whereas the TR RNA molecule can dissociate from the CP2:TR complex and re\u2010associate with a different CP2, the protein dimer does not readily dissociate to monomer under these conditions. Titration of increasing amounts of 14N\u2010CP2 resulted in the detection of [3(CP2:TR) + 3CP2] complexes that contained 12, 10, 8, 6, 4, 2, and 0 15N\u2010labeled coat protein molecules; that is, corresponding to all possible stoichiometries that differ by dimer addition. Thus, it appears that, as the initially formed [3(CP2:TR) + 3CP2] 15N\u2010labeled complexes continue on the assembly pathway to form capsids, new [3(CP2:TR) + 3CP2] are formed from a mixture of the remaining 15N\u2010labeled CP2 species and the newly\u2010added 14N material. Eventually, the percentage of all 15N\u2010labeled [3(CP2:TR) + 3CP2] decreases with increasing CP2 concentration, whereas the mixed 14N:15N and eventually all 14N complexes predominate.

The formation of this structure involves the initial annealing of a self\u2010complementary sequence located in the stem\u2010loop domain of the genome\u2010packaging signal, \u03c8\u2010RNA, a domain that consists of a highly conserved stretch of RNA folded into four discrete stem loops. Subsequent dimer stabilization involves structural rearrangements that are mediated by the chaperone activity of the nucleocapsid domain of the viral Gag polyprotein. Fabris et al. (2007) have used nano\u2010ESI\u2010MS coupled to an FT\u2010ICR mass spectrometer to determine the stoichiometry and binding constants of the assemblies formed by the nucleocapsid with the four stem loops, and to investigate the possible inhibitory effects of several small ligands on the nucleocapsid\u2010stem loop complexes. Competitive\u2010binding experiments that involve the isolated RNA elements were performed to evaluate the ability of these species to sustain specific protein interactions. Using RNA mutants, two distinct binding sites on one stem loop were identified, and the preferred site for protein binding was identified on a second stem loop. These results provide the first evidence that interactions between contiguous structures modify the binding modes of the different sites in the context of full\u2010length \u03c8\u2010RNA.",

Hence, the rapid proteolysis step is usually accomplished with pepsin, an enzyme that works optimally at low pH, and proteolysis often takes place within the injection loop or on a specially packed, on\u2010line column for fast throughput. Following digestion, if using ESI\u2010MS, an HPLC step is generally required to separate the complex peptide mixtures generated by proteolysis; typically, the injector and column must be held at low temperature to minimize back\u2010exchange during elution en route to the mass spectrometer. Any back\u2010exchange during the analysis leads to greater uncertainty in the structural information generated, and therefore control experiments to calculate the expected back\u2010exchange of amide residues during the proteolysis and HPLC\u2010MS steps are required (Zhang & Smith, 1993).",

Secondly, the scaffolding protein is released in a reaction triggered by DNA packaging, and the capsid lattice expands to become the mature, stable T = 7 capsid. In vitro, capsid expansion can be initiated by elevated temperature (Galisto & King, 1993). The use of MS techniques with HDX followed by limited pepsin proteolysis has had some success in identifying the specific residues that participate in this transformation (Tuma et al., 2001). MALDI\u2010Tof was used to identify the peptide fragments generated and to determine the amount of deuterium uptake (i.e., the accessibility of each region) that occurred. Approximately 30% of the monomeric P22 protein sequence was monitored by this approach, and the rate of HDX varied from one region of the protein to another. Some regions were exposed to exchange before procapsid expansion, whereas on formation of the mature capsid, about half of the amino acid residues in these regions became fully protected.",

In this instance, \u223c85% of the coat protein was successfully mapped from the peptic peptide fragments: a significant improvement over the earlier work. Again, significant differences between the corresponding protein regions were observed when comparing the procapsid shells with the mature capsids. In general, HDX occurred rapidly in the empty procapsid shells, but the exchangeable hydrogens were well protected in the mature capsids; in fact, there was only one region that exchanged more rapidly (i.e., was more exposed) in the mature capsids compared with the procapsids. From this experiment, it was concluded that the mature capsids have more extensive inter\u2010subunit interactions than the procapsids, but that the series of rearrangements in which new contacts are created can cause a slight local exposure of the other sites after maturation.",

The \u03a629 scaffolding protein consists of three \u03b1\u2010helices with a disordered C\u2010terminal; it is this protein that interacts with the capsid protein monomers to promote efficient assembly into icosahedral shells. The interactions between the scaffolding and capsid proteins are transient and are disrupted during ATP\u2010driven DNA packaging into the procapsids. Following DNA packaging, the scaffolding protein is lost either by proteolysis or via a conformational switch of the capsid that allows dissociation. To investigate these reactions, the conformational differences between free and procapsid\u2010bound scaffolding protein have been explored in an elegant study that uses HDX\u2010MS and revealed highly dynamic and co\u2010operative opening motions in the N\u2010terminal region. At low temperatures (4 or 10\u00b0C) when these motions were dampened, or in the case of a mutant scaffolding protein in which the N\u2010terminal helix\u2010loop\u2010helix motif was tethered via a disulfide bond, the co\u2010operative opening motions of this region were restricted; those data confirm the interpretation of the HDX\u2010MS results.

HDX of the monomeric protein was compared with that of the assembled capsid, and a difference in exchange rates was noted when comparing peptides from both complexes; that difference suggested that the dimer interface is important in the formation of the tube\u2010like structure. The HDX patterns of the immature and mature capsids of HIV\u20101 have also been compared, using ESI\u2010MS\u2014both on the intact protein and on peptide fragments that result from pepsin proteolysis. The immature capsid is spherical in morphology, with the Gag polyprotein arranged radially.

The changes in protection upon maturation have been interpreted in terms of an interaction between the N\u2010 and C\u2010terminal domains of the capsid protein. Only half of the capsid protein assembles into the conical core; that is, only a sub\u2010population of the total capsid protein molecules in the virion contribute to the mature viral core (Lanman et al., 2004).",

FHV also has a protein capsid that consists of two proteins with regions that are distinctly internal and external to the virus surface. Using time\u2010resolved proteolysis, the expected cleavages on the surface\u2010accessible regions of the coat proteins were observed, together with unexpected cleavages in regions that lie in the inside of the viral capsids in the crystal structures.

A: A T = 1 viral particle has 20 triangular facets, each having threefold symmetry, implying that it would consist of 60 coat protein subunits (asymmetric units). Higher triangulation numbers result from sub\u2010triangulating this basic arrangement. Higher T numbers can be calculated using the formula T = h\n2 + hk + k\n2, where h and k are integers with values h \u2265 1 and k \u2265 0. Thus a T = 3 structure is expected to have 180 coat protein subunits in its shell. B: A series of cryo\u2010EM reconstructions of viral particles illustrating their quasi\u2010equivalent structures.

A: Zoomed in part of the spectrum focusing on the undecameric and dodecameric ion signals. The inset in (A) shows the zero\u2010charge convolution of this spectrum, which indicates that the ratio between undecamers and dodecamers of the portal protein P22 is \u223c2:1. B: Whole range mass spectrum. Oligomeric assemblies with stoichiometries varying from 1 to 8 and from 11 to 12 are present. C: Analysis and SOlving complex Macromolecular Mass Spectra (SOMMS) simulation (van Breukelen et al., 2006) of the whole ESI\u2010MS spectrum. Peak position and intensity coincidence confirms correctness of assignment of different peaks. The inset shows the SOMMS simulation\u2010derived relative abundance of ions of different oligomeric states. The simulation confirms that the ratio between undecamers and dodecamers is \u223c2:1 and furthermore reveals that P22 is partly unstable under the solution conditions used for ESI, and dissociates primarily into species ranging from trimers to octamers. Interestingly, the nonamers and decamers are nearly absent in the ESI spectrum (Poliakov et al., 2007). Reprinted from van Breukelen et al. (2006) with permission from Elsevier.",

Panel (c) shows the distribution of the five\u2010 and threefold symmetry axes (black and white symbols respectively) within the icosahedral surface lattice of the MS2 capsid and the arrangement of the quasi\u2010equivalent dimers, AB (blue/green) and CC (red) within it. Alongside are ribbon models for the structures of each, with the A/B dimer bound to TR RNA, and an enlarged cartoon of their relationship within the capsid (Stockley et al., 2007). B: Bacteriophage MS2 capsid re\u2010assembly monitored by real\u2010time nano\u2010ESI\u2010MS. The spectra were acquired over the range m/z 500\u201330000 for samples in ammonium acetate (40 mM) at pH 5.2\u20135.7. The components are labeled as follows: A = CP; B = CP2; C = CP2:TR; D = 182.7 kDa, assigned as [3(CP2:TR) + 3CP2], and E = \u223c288\u2013300 kDa, unassigned. The number immediately following each letter is the charge state of those particular ions. The spectra are as follows: (a) CP alone (8 \u00b5M); pH 3.2; (b\u2013d) are for re\u2010assembly at pH 5.2\u20135.7 at a stoichiometry of CP2 to TR 1:1 (8 \u00b5M:8 \u00b5M) at times 1, 90, anf 300 min, respectively. Spectrum (e) is the 1:1 pre\u2010equilibrated starting point for re\u2010assembly at a stoichiometry of CP2 to TR 2:1 (16 \u00b5M:8 \u00b5M), spectra (f\u2013h) at times 1, 120, 180 min, respectively. Note, spectra (b) and (e) are essentially equivalent. The bars below the spectra indicate a magnification factor of 5 for all ions above m/z 6,000 to enhance clarity. Reprinted from Stockley et al.
