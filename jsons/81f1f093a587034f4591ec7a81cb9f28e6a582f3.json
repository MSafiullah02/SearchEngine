The UK reported its first case on January 31 st ; and as of May 18 th 2020 243,695 confirmed cases had been reported [1] . At the beginning of the study in early April, UK policy was to prioritise available tests for patients requiring hospitalisation and outbreaks in institutional settings. Evidence suggests that over 80% of COVID-19 cases are mild [2] and that the proportion who are asymptomatic when tested may be as high as 80% [3] . Therefore, using laboratory confirmation in hospitalised cases will severely underestimate disease incidence. Repeated testing among individuals in the community will help estimate trends in COVID-19 point prevalence and help to describe the characteristics of milder infection.

First, the sample is relatively small and purposive (as individuals self-select to register with the cohort) and is therefore likely to not be representative on characteristics beyond age and sex. Secondly, limited information about timing and symptoms makes reconstructing timelines among households difficult. Thirdly, we made a number of assumptions when estimating under-ascertainment, and did not fully take into account the temporal distribution of likelihood of PCR detection. Linking the swabbing results with information collected weekly in Flusurvey may enable us to reconstruct timelines for each case and to document the duration of symptoms and risk factors associated with becoming infected. This data should be interpreted in conjunction with seroprevalence studies, which are ongoing.",

Age distribution of participants did not differ significantly by sex (p=0.8). Of the 698 individuals who received a second swab, 444 had returned them by 12/05/2020 (response rate 63.6%). Of the 1064 wave 1 samples received, 816 were timely and 248 were late. Table1. Age distribution of sample compared with London population Of the 816 timely samples from the first wave, 18 were positive in 14 households (positivity 2.2%, 95%CI 1.4-3.5). Positivity was higher among females and among 10-19 year olds (Table 2). Of the 18 positive individuals, 14 (78%) had experienced symptoms in the last 2 weeks and 4 (22%) had not. Symptom onset among symptomatic participants ranged from March 15-30 th and time from symptom onset to sample collection ranged from 4-19 days.",
