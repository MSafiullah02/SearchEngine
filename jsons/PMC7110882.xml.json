In view of the high case-fatality rate and the potential global spread of the virus, there is an urgent need to develop effective therapies for this infection. In a recent review, based on therapies used for the related severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, the possible use of interferon and ribavirin was considered as a therapeutic option.8 The purpose of this study was to describe the outcome of the use of a combination of interferon-\u03b12b and ribavirin in the management of five patients with MERS-CoV infections.",

One patient (case 2) developed thrombocytopenia, with a platelet count that dropped from 408 to 49 \u00d7 109/l (Table 2, Table 3) and one patient had possible hemolysis (case 3). All patients had severe disease with progressive respiratory failure, developed multi-organ failure, and died a mean 39.6 (standard deviation 8.5) days after admission. None of the patients had bacteremia or fungemia during their hospital stay. Figure 1 shows the median, minimum, and maximum values for amylase, lipase, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) for all the patients before initiation of therapy and at week1 and 2 after therapy initiation.",

In the treatment of SARS-CoV, no effect of oseltamivir or ribavirin was observed when these agents were started 6\u201314 days after symptom onset.11, 12, 13 Early therapy with ribavirin, within 48 h of hospitalization or after the diagnosis of SARS, has been shown to be associated with better outcomes, although the numbers of patients enrolled in these studies has been small.7, 14, 15, 16, 17 In the treatment of influenza, oseltamivir therapy early in the disease resulted in reduced mortality when this was started not later than 8 days after the onset of symptoms.18 Early in vitro studies showed that ribavirin and interferon have anti-MERS-CoV activity.19 The in vitro activity of interferon was augmented by the concomitant use of ribavirin.20 In a rhesus macaque model of MERS-CoV infection, the combination of interferon-\u03b12b and ribavirin therapy was effective in limiting the disease and resulted in very mild radiographic evidence of pneumonia.21 The treatment was given within 8 h after inoculation of the rhesus macaques. Treated animals had lower levels of systemic and local proinflammatory markers and fewer viral genome copies.21 Although these preclinical data are promising, our report illustrates some of the real world issues of dealing with a novel emerging viral infection. Our patients were not diagnosed until a week into their illnesses, by which time all five were on mechanical ventilation. They had multiple comorbidities, which most likely adversely affected their clinical outcomes. In addition, we had no serial virologic determination of MERS-CoV levels in airway secretions to shed light on the possibility of virological clearance, virological failure, or clinical failure of therapy.",
