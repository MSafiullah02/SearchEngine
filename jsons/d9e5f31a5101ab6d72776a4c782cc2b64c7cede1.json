Such ineffective oversight seemed possible mainly because of long-standing ties between a number of government bureaucrats and the CMC. Additionally, conjectures have arisen regarding how improper responses dealing with the sinking and capsizing ferry ship resulted in much preventable loss of life, from a post hoc disaster management perspective.

In fact, Magetti and Verhoest (2014) argue that bureaucratic accountability in a particular society or country is a historical construct generated with the establishment of a country-specific bureaucratic institution. This means that the conceptual definition and scope of accountability can be diverse due to the endemic and historical courses of national and institutional development. Nonetheless, accountability is considered one of the most important concepts in public administration (Huber & Rothstein, 2013; Marchant, 2001; Matten, 2004; Rothstein, 2003) .

Rosen (1998) explains that the essence of bureaucratic accountability parallels with the citizens' interest in how bureaucrats exert power. Similarly, Gormley and Balla (2004) emphasize fairness as a core value embedded into the concept of bureaucratic accountability. They argue that as a group, bureaucrats often are not democratic representatives. Therefore, fairness ought to be the core value of bureaucratic accountability in the formulation of policy decisions and administrative practices. Bureaucratic accountability refers to \"desirable\" attitudes, aptitudes, and behaviors of government agencies expected for the pursuit of the welfare of their citizens. Romzek and Dubnick (1987) suggest a more deliberate conceptualization of bureaucratic accountability as an effective analytical framework enabling a systemic examination of bureaucratic behavior. They emphasize four important conceptual dimensions of bureaucratic accountability, including hierarchical, legal, professional, and political dimensions while analyzing the case of the 1986 Space Shuttle Challenger disaster in the United States. Synthesizing previous arguments, Romzek and Ingraham (2000, p. 242) further claim that four conceptually distinctive types of bureaucratic accountability (i.e., hierarchical, legal, professional, and political accountability) are often grounded in two fundamental organizational contingencies: (i) degree of bureaucratic autonomy and (ii) source of expectations and/or control over bureaucratic behavior.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 37, "end": 49, "text": "Rosen (1998)", "ref_id": "BIBREF70"}, {"start": 188, "end": 212, "text": "Gormley and Balla (2004)", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 703, "end": 728, "text": "Romzek and Dubnick (1987)", "ref_id": "BIBREF72"}, {"start": 1179, "end": 1213, "text": "Romzek and Ingraham (2000, p. 242)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Bureaucratic Accountability"}, {"text": "Hierarchical accountability is more likely to be emphasized in an organizational environment where there exists a low degree of bureaucratic autonomy to deal with internal expectations.

Public officials, for instance, should respond to voters' requests, even though the voters do not have legal authority.

Professional accountability gains more importance, when government bureaucracies have to deal with more complex and uncertain issues and technical experts require more discretion as politicians and public managers begin partially delegating their primary accountability (e.g., political accountability) to such experts (e.g., professional accountability). Experts are expected to be considerate of moral or ethical responsibility in a broader scheme of principal-agent relationship, as well (Dicke & Ott, 1999) . Romzek and Dubnick (1987) argue that the emphasis on a specific type (or combination) of bureaucratic accountability within an organizational setting is influenced by three major factors: institutional context of organization, manager's strategic motivation, and the nature of tasks. Ideally, government agencies are expected to equally sustain these various types of accountability when performing their organizational tasks. However, in reality, depending on the parameters of the three aforementioned organizational characteristics, agencies' accountability configurations vary, while, more often than not, disproportionally emphasizing one or two more dominant dimension(s)-or type(s)-of bureaucratic accountability in their daily administrative practices. For example, professional accountability would be considered the most important type of bureaucratic accountability within those government agencies whose primary tasks frequently involve highly scientific and technical matters, such as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). Furthermore, within the same government agency, those in top manager positions are more likely than middle managers or street level bureaucrats to emphasize political accountability, while aiming to maintain responsiveness toward key external stakeholders.

In this section, we attempt to understand the KCG's accountability structure from an organizational perspective, while focusing on how its institutional context and organizational leadership have historically informed the emphasis on hierarchical and political accountability within the KCG which often contradicts the nature of its primary tasks. 1 In doing so, we pay particular attention to the KCG's organizational settings from a historical institutionalism perspective, which in essence claims that the nature of institutions-conceived of as formal and informal rules, norms, and culture as the products of historically iterative reinforcement of initial institutional character-affects organizational actors' behavioral decisions (Berman, 2013) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 570, "end": 571, "text": "1", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 959, "end": 973, "text": "(Berman, 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Accountability Structure in the Korea Coast Guard (KCG): An Organizational Perspective"}, {"text": "Historically, the KCG has maintained a very similar character to the South Korean navy, which itself focuses on maritime security rather than emergency management. After independence from Japanese rule in 1945, the \"modern\" South Korean navy needed to defend its national sea jurisdiction and later intercept infiltrators sent by North Korea to the South. In addition to sustaining national security through these activities, the navy was also responsible for inspecting Japanese fishing boats crossing the sea border (Roh, 2011) to protect the South Korean fishing industry. However, such practices by the Korean navy could be interpreted as invasive military action as, conventionally, a foreign ship is considered a part of foreign territory, which could generate rising military tension with a neighboring country. Accordingly, the KCG, which used a similar rank system to the Korean navy as a part of the Maritime Police Unit within the National Police Agency in South Korea, was founded in 1953 to substitute for the Korean navy's duties of inspecting civilian ships (KCG, 2013c) while not instigating any unnecessary potential international conflicts. Because of these origins and its organizational nature as a police unit, hierarchical accountability, in which members are judged by how well they obey commands, has long been emphasized within the KCG. 2 As long as North Korea was hijacking South Korean fishing boats and Japanese fishing boats engaged in fishery activities near the Korean coast in the 1960s, when there were no clearly defined jurisdictional maritime borders, the KCG had to implement frequent sea patrols. Following the Korean-Japanese Fisheries Agreement in 1965, however, this inspection role, especially against Japanese fishing boats, gradually waned, as the agreement encompassed the establishment of a clear jurisdictional demarcation of the sea between South Korea and Japan. The KCG instead assumed the tasks of criminal investigation and law enforcement in the sea with the Maritime Police Force Act in 1962 (KCG, 2013c) . The KCG increasingly concentrated on policing against violent crime and maritime pollution.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 518, "end": 529, "text": "(Roh, 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF71"}, {"start": 1362, "end": 1363, "text": "2", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 2047, "end": 2059, "text": "(KCG, 2013c)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Sustaining Hierarchical Accountability"}, {"text": "Shifting and varied geopolitical situations in the 1990s necessitated the KCG to refocus its role toward inspection and patrol. A temporarily peaceful mood was fostered by the inter-Korean reconciliation and peace agreement in 1992. In 1992, South Korea established diplomatic ties with the People's Republic of China, which inadvertently encouraged the development of an illegal Chinese fishing industry in Korean waters (Roh, 2011) . Prior to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, passed in 1994, South Korea had no authority regarding maritime borders, but with this convention, all countries were granted special rights over the use of marine resources in an exclusive economic zone (EEZ) extending 200 nautical miles from their shores (KCG, 2013a) . With the recognition of the growing importance of sea resources, the KCG became an independent agency in 1996 as a direct countermeasure against Chinese illegal fishing (KCG, 2013c). Since that period, the primary role of the KCG, as an independent government agency, has remained inspection and patrol. The KCG has expanded the size of its budget 5.2 times since 1996 and established many local branches, including 16 coast guard stations, 87 substations, and 240 local offices, along with the KCG Academy (KCG, 2013c). Meanwhile, the KCG, along with its military origin and continued duty of inspection and patrol, has sustained the hierarchical accountability of its core accountability structure.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 422, "end": 433, "text": "(Roh, 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF71"}, {"start": 755, "end": 767, "text": "(KCG, 2013a)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Sustaining Hierarchical Accountability"}, {"text": "The KCG also became inclined toward political accountability as it shed the characteristics of the Korean navy and assumed those of a government agency. Typically, Korean bureaucracy has been fully supported by political elites. Bureaucrats and political elites have maintained a close communication system for the exchange of exclusive information (Im, Campbell, & Cha, 2013) . Likewise, top managers within the KCG organizational hierarchy are typically more responsive to politicians, a key external stakeholder who may hold influence on its organizational sustainability by exercising government budget and personnel decision-making power, than to any other potential stakeholders, such as the issue public or related for-profit or non-profit entities, involved in various administrative practices. Due to such emphasis on political accountability, maritime security, including inspection and patrol, have become the primary priority for the KCG over any other duties to external stakeholders, though the KCG has been responsible for various additional duties, including search and rescue, marine environmental protection, maritime traffic safety management, and maritime pollution response (KCG, 2013a). Three specific contingencies illustrate why the KCG was inclined to prioritize political accountability: (i) the increasing illegal fishing activities of Chinese ships; (ii) the \"jurisdictional\" conflict with the National Police Agency; and (iii) the dispute over equitable distribution of the increasing police human resources pool allocated by South Korean central personnel authorities.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 349, "end": 376, "text": "(Im, Campbell, & Cha, 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Emphasizing Political Accountability"}, {"text": "First, the problem of illegal fishing by Chinese ships has strongly influenced the KCG's focus. 3 Material and financial damages suffered by Korean fishing boats have underscored the ongoing importance of this task, and the media has continuously emphasized the problems caused by illegal Chinese fishing boats (Park, 2014; Yonhap News, 2012) . This has also been a prime opportunity for the KCG to promote itself. News images, as well as documentary films portraying the hardships of staff patrolling waters against illegal Chinese fishing boats, were produced with the KCG's assistance (Korean Broadcasting System, 2012; Munhwa Broadcasting Corporation, 2011) . Shocked by these dire scenes, members of the general public began to call for better equipment for KCG operations, which translated to more justifiable resources for the KCG. 4 Politicians and legislators fell under pressure from fishermen, whose livelihoods were under threat and who fully supported the KCG as their \"guardians.\" As a result, while attempting to become more politically accountable to its various external stakeholders, the function and organization of the KCG became increasingly hinged upon meeting maritime security obligations, to the detriment of other duties, including maritime search and rescue missions. For example, the KCG's budget for search and rescue missions in 2013 was about 9 million U.S. dollars, which constitutes only 1.6 percent of its total annual budget of 1.5 billion U.S. dollars. Meanwhile, in the same year, the KCG spent approximately 300 million U.S. dollars on maritime security (KCG, 2013c). The KCG's annual report released in 2014 also shows that much of new personnel recruitment was related to the maritime security mission: 3,700 newly hired personnel (42.6 percent of total recruits) were assigned to maritime security. In contrast, only 482 personnel (5.6 percent of total recruits) were assigned to search and rescue functions. In addition, the KCG had purchased heavy vessels and aircraft rather than basic rescue equipment for search and rescue. It turned out later that 52 out of 328 field offices that take first action, when maritime accidents occur, did not have basic rescue equipment, such as patrol boats or jet skis (Korea Board of Audit and Inspection, 2014).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 96, "end": 97, "text": "3", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 311, "end": 323, "text": "(Park, 2014;", "ref_id": "BIBREF66"}, {"start": 324, "end": 342, "text": "Yonhap News, 2012)", "ref_id": "BIBREF84"}, {"start": 588, "end": 622, "text": "(Korean Broadcasting System, 2012;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 623, "end": 661, "text": "Munhwa Broadcasting Corporation, 2011)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 839, "end": 840, "text": "4", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Emphasizing Political Accountability"}, {"text": "Second, another major issue contributing to the KCG's orientation toward political accountability involves its \"jurisdictional\" conflicts with the National Police Agency, which have further encouraged the KCG to focus on \"powerful\" external stakeholders, such as legislators. As discussed briefly, although the term \"Korea Coast Guard\" has been used since 1991, the KCG resided under the National Police Agency until 1996, the year when it became an independent government agency for the first time. For instance, from 1986 to 1989, the KCG assumed control over incoming and outgoing sea vessels, which previously were under the jurisdiction of the National Police Agency. However, the line of authority and responsibility between the two governmental entities was murky due to a lack of legal clarification during the structural reorganization process. In fact, a policy study regarding the restructuring of the KCG's branch offices led by the Korean Association for Policy Studies (2013) found-through personal interviews-that even some chief officers of the same KCG substation were unclear about their jurisdiction and interpreted it quite differently. One of the main goals of the KCG, as a government entity holding its own organizational \"sovereignty,\" was to establish a clear-cut line of authority and responsibility for itself, independent from the National Police Agency. For that end, the KCG needed more political support from its stakeholders, notably legislators, in exchange for a high degree of political accountability.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Emphasizing Political Accountability"}, {"text": "Third, the KCG has also stressed political accountability in order to justify and bolster its crusade for a better share of the recently expanded pool of police human resources allocated by central personnel authorities. One of the promises extended by current South Korean president Park Geun-hye (2013-present) during her presidential election campaign involved the recruitment of 30,000 new policemen for the purpose of strengthening national security. However, the specific distribution of these human resources between the National Police Agency and the KCG was not specified in the campaign pledge. A lack of personnel and equipment remained the biggest problem in the KCG, even though it had over 10,000 personnel, 300 ships, and 23 aircraft.

Statistics from the KCG (2013c) White Paper also show that equipment is insufficient. Among 87 substations, only 53 substations have patrol ships, which are the most important equipment for search and rescue missions at sea. 6 The KCG managed to increase by 10,000 personnel in 2014. To achieve these numbers, the guard was compelled to lobby legislators and earn political support to justify their quest. 7 The KCG's accomplishment of becoming an exemplary institution of the Balanced Scorecard (BSC) in 2006 is one earlier example of its efforts to gain political influence. 8 The KCG was the first institution in the public sector to accept the BSC (in 2003), even though this required significant reform of their personnel system. The BSC was one of the main policies of the Rho Moo-Hyun administration (2003-2008) but many other government agencies were initially unwilling to accept the policy because they were wary of its effects.

This timeline leads to the inference that the orders from the KCG West Regional Headquarters were neither timely nor appropriate during the rescue operations; they should have given the order for rescue crews to enter the sinking ship immediately after the incident was reported. To make matters worse, mainly due to hierarchical accountability concerns, the captain of the patrol vessel did not make any prompt discretionary decisions to rescue the passengers upon arrival at the scene with his rescue team during the vacuum of timely orders passed down the line of command within the KCG's organizational hierarchy (Korean Maritime Safety Tribunal, 2014).

One of the key countermeasures to mitigate disasters is to put the right experts in the right place, who have enough training to properly use their technical knowledge and professional experiences. Well-trained experts with professional know-how (and the leeway and capability to improvise split-second independent decisions) are essential for predicting, assessing, and managing various disasters (Kapucu, Augustin, & Garayev, 2009; Koliba, Mills, & Zia, 2011; Richardson, Macauley, Cohen, Anderson, & Stern, 2011) . Romzek and Dubnick (1987) , for example, claimed that decision-making relying upon professional accountability plays an important role in avoiding management failure in their analysis of the 1986 U.S. space shuttle Challenger disaster. Romzek and Dubnick (1987) also show that the political and bureaucratic accountability which had been developed at NASA in response to institutional expectations were not the appropriate mechanisms to respond to the 1986 U.S. space shuttle Challenger disaster. They insist that this management failure could have been avoided if NASA had made the decision to rely upon professional accountability.

In October 2010, for instance, after a routine food safety screening, the city of Seoul announced that octopus heads contain hazardous amounts of cadmium, a carcinogen that can generate severe negative health effects on the human body, especially on the liver and kidneys. Octopus has long been popular in South Korea (in part for its purported aphrodisiac properties) and such an announcement from the Seoul city government triggered a high-alert reaction-along with considerable confusion-among citizens. In responding to this situation, the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety, a South Korean central government agency, promptly tested the safety of octopus consumption-and other seafood-and announced that all parts of octopus are safe to eat, based upon its test results (Ministry of Food and Drug Safety, 2011). Due to the prompt intervention of the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety-which has long been well known for its scientific expertise on food and drug safety issues along with rigorous lab test methodology-the confusion regarding the safety of octopus consumption among citizens soon boiled down, and no further serious health concerns-due to the related risk perceptions-prevailed.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conclusion and Discussion"}, {"text": "Another similar example can be found in the case of the Korea Forest Service, an independent government agency built up upon its task-relevant expertise and specialty while emphasizing professional accountability.

The Korea Forest Service played a critical role in the reforestation process. The chief executive, as well as middle managers of the Korea Forest Service, were appointed based upon their professional merits for forestry management. At the same time, the Forest Training Institute of the Korea Forest Service continually retrained public officers, who sought to acquire and update their knowledge and skills about forestry management (Korean Association for Public Administration, 2009).
