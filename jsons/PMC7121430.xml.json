Women are disproportionally affected compared to men, and both acute and chronic rhinosinusitis are most prevalent in middle-aged adults compared to any other age group [3]. Primary care physicians and specialists manage rhinosinusitis with equivalent technical efficiency, with primary care physicians providing less costly treatment [5]. Chronic rhinosinusitis has a high economic burden; in 2007, total expenditures in the United States were estimated to be $8.6 billion [4].",

Antibiotics initiated in this setting shorten the duration of illness, offer more prompt symptomatic relief, and prevent recurrence and suppurative complications [1]. Standard-dose amoxicillin-clavulanate (875 mg/125 mg twice daily), rather than amoxicillin alone, is recommended as first-line treatment due to the high prevalence of \u03b2-lactamase-producing H. influenzae [1]. However, standard-dose amoxicillin-clavulanate is inadequate for penicillin-non-susceptible (PNS) S. pneumoniae, which have a mutation in the penicillin-binding protein 3 that is unaffected by the addition of a \u03b2-lactamase inhibitor. Thus, in patients with certain risk factors, high-dose amoxicillin-clavulanate (i.e., 2 g/125 mg twice daily) is recommended as first-line treatment. Risk factors for PNS include residence in geographic regions with high (\u226510 %) endemic rates of PNS S. pneumoniae, severe infection (e.g., signs of systemic toxicity with fever of \u226539 \u00b0C [102 \u00b0F]), age >65 years, recent hospitalization, patients who are immunocompromised, or antibiotic use within the past month [1]. Respiratory fluoroquinolones are also highly active against PNS S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae, but are not superior to \u03b2-lactam antibiotics [1]. Options for patients with \u03b2-lactam antibiotic allergy include doxycycline (100 mg twice daily or 200 mg daily), levofloxacin (500 mg daily), or moxifloxacin (400 mg daily).\n",

Peritonsillar abscess can be difficult to distinguish from severe tonsillopharyngitis, as both can present with asymmetric tonsillar hypertrophy and drooling. The hallmark of peritonsillar abscess, however, is trismus, which results from inflammation and pus that has tracked above the pterygoid region [28]. Other characteristic symptoms include a muffled \u201chot potato\u201d voice, severe unilateral sore throat, edema of the ipsilateral soft palate, and deviation of the uvula [28]. When the diagnosis is in question, ultrasonography (transcutaneous or intraoral) or CT imaging can aid in identifying an abscess and thus distinguish from peritonsillar cellulitis [31].

Treatment accomplishes three objectives: (1) prevention of both suppurative complications and acute rheumatic fever; (2) decreased communicability, which allows patients to return to work or school; and (3) shortened duration of illness [23]. First-line treatment options are penicillin (250 mg twice to three times daily in children, 250 mg four times daily or 500 mg twice daily in adolescents and adults) or amoxicillin (50 mg/kg daily with a maximum dose of 1,000 mg/day) for 10 days. Penicillin-allergic patients may be treated with a first-generation cephalosporin such as cephalexin (20 mg/kg/dose twice daily with a maximum of 500 mg/dose) or cefadroxil (30 mg/kg daily with a maximum of 1,000 mg/day) for 10 days, clindamycin (7 mg/kg/dose twice daily with a maximum of 300 mg/dose) for 10 days, or azithromycin (12 mg/kg once daily with a maximum of 500 mg/day) for 5 days [30].

Tonsillectomy has been shown to improve quality of life in children with recurrent tonsillopharyngitis by reducing the number of throat infections, healthcare provider visits, and need for antibiotic therapy [35]. Children who have more severe or frequent episodes of tonsillopharyngitis may benefit more from tonsillectomy than less severely affected children [35]. Tonsillectomy may also be beneficial in patients with multiple antibiotic allergies, PFAPA syndrome (periodic fever, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis, and adenitis), and recurrent peritonsillar abscess [35]. There is limited evidence on the effectiveness of tonsillectomy in adults with recurrent tonsillopharyngitis [36], but there is some retrospective data that there is a positive and prolonged effect on quality of life, especially with regards to younger patients with more severe symptoms [37].\n",
