No prolonged action or complications were observed in those cases [3\u20137]. Inhalation anesthesia with sevoflurane alone enabled management under spontaneous respiration for an orthopedic minor surgery [4], and a combination of remifentanil with sevoflurane provided adequate reflection suppression for fiber intubation via a laryngeal mask [7]. These reports suggested the effectiveness of inhalation anesthesia with a short-acting opioid (e.g., remifentanil and fentanyl) under minor surgery for prompt recovery.\n",

As osseous fragility and profound intellectual disability have been reported in MSS patients [8], it is important to prevent postoperative agitation. It is also necessary to avoid an increase in secretions due to postoperative excitement, including those due to respiratory complications and the influence of wound infection. Sevoflurane has been reported to be associated with an increased risk of emergence agitation [9]. And the management of total intravenous anesthesia avoided poor sedation by leakage of inhalation anesthesia during bronchoscopy. In our patient\u2019s case, we therefore used total intravenous anesthesia for the surgery and then sedated her with dexmedetomidine during the postoperative period in the ICU; this protocol provided adequate sedation with no complications.",
