But the patient had no travel to high-risk countries and no contact with an individual with high-risk travel thus, as she did not meet the current Centers for Disease Control (CDC) criteria, testing was not pursued by public health officials. A SARS CoV2 infection was therefore low on our initial differential diagnosis and a typical bacterial infection was thought to be more likely. To date, no source of exposure has been identified for this patient. Therefore, we conclude that she must have had community acquired disease. Although her course was complicated by acute renal failure, dialysis was never required and she did not require ECLS. She improved clinically following a week of therapy, with a significant reduction in ventilator support and interval improvement in her oxygenation and chest radiograph findings ( Figure   3 ).

While the majority of COVID-19 cases were identified within our patient's age group years), only 18.5% of severe cases were from this age group. Those over the age of 65 comprised 49.2% of severe cases 6, 9 . In a large review of 73,314 cases from China the authors reported 5% of all cases meeting critical illness (i.e. shock, respiratory failure, and/or multi-organ failure) with a case-fatality rate of 49% in that subgroup 9 . Health care personnel that became infected suffered a similar amount of severe and critically ill cases as the general population. Overall, these reviews note a case fatality rate of 1.40-3.46%, though this may be considerably lower when accounting for a likely large number of mild or asymptomatic patients that were not tested 6, 9, 10 DeWit and colleagues from the NIH, Gilead, and Columbia University successfully treated rhesus macaques against a model of MERS 13 . Whether remdesivir is effective against human COVID-19 is not known. The ability to provide early testing and diagnosis would certainly accelerate clinical trial efforts to investigate this compound.",

Given changes in epidemiologic risk and potential for atypical presentations, the challenge for clinicians to identify whom to test becomes more difficult. This virus has a prolonged incubation time (2.1-11.1 days in the most optimistic 8 estimate of 88 Chinese patients) with a wide range of disease severity 16 . As we have reviewed, its radiographic appearance can be quite varied both in time from symptom onset and overall appearance. A wide variety of symptomology and radiographic appearances create difficulty for providers to identify COVID-19 and differentiate it from other more common respiratory infections. It has also been shown that human coronaviruses persist on inanimate surfaces for up to 9 days, thus, can be picked up without close contact to an infected person 17 . As noted in a recent editorial, diagnosis becomes even more difficult considering the likelihood of a large number of mild or asymptomatic patients who are not formally identified with a SARS CoV2 infection 18, 19 . Because there are individuals in the community that are not manifesting severe enough symptoms to warrant presenting to healthcare providers, we should expect community spread to occur more frequently, challenging our ability to adequately contain the spread of SARS CoV2.",

Further history obtained through family interviews revealed that although she did not have known contact with any infected individual, the patient worked in a commercial facility with a high volume of customers within the same county as the facility that had been housing repatriated individuals with SARS CoV2 infection. This raised the possibility that SARS CoV2 could be acquired through community spread of the disease. Our speculation was supported by the concurrent publication of a locally transmitted COVID-19 case, reported from Taiwan 3 . For these reasons our patient was reviewed again and at that time COVID-19 testing was recommended by the CDC and the patient was placed under strict airborne and contact precautions. The SARS CoV2 test returned positive two days later (Figure 2). Remdesivir (an investigational anti-viral nucleotide analog prodrug) was started as an intravenous 5 infusion within 36 hours of diagnosis.

Diagnosis of COVID-19 is currently confirmed with PCR based testing of appropriate respiratory samples. At the time of the patient's presentation, CDC guidelines restricted testing to those patients with mild to moderate symptoms who either travelled to Hubei Province, or had direct contact with a positive case, or those with severe symptoms who travelled to mainland China 4 . Despite our patient's severe disease, given the absence of travel or known exposure, she did not meet the criteria for testing. Since then, because of this case and other suspected community acquired SARS CoV2 cases, the CDC has updated these guidelines. Now any patient with severe disease (e.g. ARDS or pneumonia) requiring hospitalization without an explanatory diagnosis can be tested even if no clear source of exposure is identified. Several other high-6 risk countries -Iran, South Korea, Italy, and Japan -have since been included into the epidemiological risk assessment in addition to China, which was the only one originally listed4 .Our case highlights significant knowledge gaps in the diagnosis and management of this disease. Without clear risk factors, the patient's infection first masqueraded as a community acquired pneumonia given the initial predominantly unilateral lobar involvement on chest imaging. This radiographic presentation is atypical. A recent article reviewing the CT scans of 21 Chinese patients infected with SARS CoV2 showed the predominant imaging finding in 18/21 patients to be a mix of consolidation and ground glass opacities involving two or more lobes with 76% of patients having bilateral involvement 5 . Single lobe opacities occurred in only 3/21 patients and consolidation alone without ground glass opacities occurred in no patients. In addition, a recent retrospective review of 1099 Chinese patients noted that the predominant radiographic findings were ground glass opacities without mention of dense consolidations being present6 . Early identification is confounded by delayed radiographic presentations. Only 59% of patients subsequently diagnosed with COVID-19 had an abnormal radiograph on presentation in a review of 21 patients, with imaging findings reaching peak severity 10 days after symptom onset7 . This was similarly noted in a review of 121 patients where bilateral lung involvement only presented in 10/36 patients in the first 0-2 days from symptom onset, but in 22/25 of patients who presented 6-12 days after symptom onset 8 .

Similarly to other viral diseases, an early prediction model for COVID-19 mortality, the MuLBSTA (Multilobular infiltration, hypo-Lymphocytosis, Bacterial coinfection, Smoking history, hyper-Tension and Age>60 years), score was suggested 11 . Our patient however, being without comorbidities and of a relatively young age, falls outside of the most identified at-risk groups for severe disease indicating that the applicability of the MuLBSTA score for predicting the risk of mortality in 2019-nCoV infection requires further investigation 12 . Once the diagnosis of COVID-19 was confirmed, our patient was placed on remdesivir infusion, an experimental drug, given under an Investigational New Drug (IND) program 13 , provided by Gilead for this purpose. Currently, there are no approved specific antiviral therapies for coronavirus infections in humans. Previous attempts at treating both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV patients with approved antivirals (ribavirin and lopinavir-ritonavir), corticosteroids, or interferons, have not been effective in randomized controlled trials 14 . At UC Davis, our colleagues showed that the nucleoside ribose analogue GS-441524A and its prodrug GS-5734 (remdesivir) strongly inhibited coronavirus infection in cats 15 .
