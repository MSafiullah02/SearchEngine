To address if these data can be consistently understood, we develop a model that takes into account all main qualitative features of the infection progression under suppression measures, while remaining simple enough to estimate the key dynamics parameters. We find that social distancing measures had a large effect in provinces, where moreover higher transmissibility appears to have triggered more effective protection. Hubei is, however, a far outlier with significantly larger transmissibility, but lower protection. Predicted infection attack rate is significantly higher for Hubei, but much lower than necessary for herd immunity. Case Fatality Rate is five times larger in Hubei, but our estimated Infection Fatality Rates are much more uniform/consistent across all provinces. Therefore, interplay of transmissibility, effective protection, and detection efficiency differences may explain apparently drastic count discrepancies.",

As a rough baseline, a modeling study (8) based on the Wuhan infection dynamics, estimated as many as 150,000 confirmed cases per day in Chongqing alone (due to its large population coupled with intense travel volume with Wuhan)instead, the actual (reported) peak number for all Mainland China outside Hubei was just 831.",

The rebuttal quoted a study (14) , which concluded that China COVID-19 numbers are in accordance with Banford's law. Two additional papers (15) (16) are also quoted: The first paper shows a good correlation between the case counts in provinces outside Hubei, and outbound Wuhan mobility (tracked through mobile phones) (15)the correlations are however scale invariant, so this also does not explain the drastic case and fatality count differences after January 23 rd in Fig. 1 . These two studies also show that Wuhan quarantine set much lower initial conditions (number of detected cases and fatalities on January 23 rd ) for the infected in other provinces, which is intuitively plausible. However, these initial conditions were still about the same for Hubei and all other provinces (see Fig. 1 ), while the subsequent (after January 23 rd ) time evolutions are drastically different. 1. What interplay between the transmissibility and the suppression measure effects is responsible for the large difference in the count numbers between Hubei and the rest of PRC? 2. What is the Infected Fatality Rate (IFR, the number of fatalities per infected persons) in PRC? Case Fatality Rate (CFR, the number of fatalities per detected cases) can be obtained directly from the data, but is highly sensitive to the testing capacity (larger testing coverage leads to lower CFR). IFR is a more fundamental mortality parameter, as it does not depend on the testing coverage, but is however much harder to determine, due to the unknown number of infected cases. 3. What is the infection attack rate (AR), i.e. a fraction of population that got infected (and presumably became resistant afterwards), in Hubei and other provinces? Estimating AR allows understanding risks that the epidemic will reinitiate. As this study is completed, PRC announced that they will assess AR in Wuhan through serology tests on almost entire Wuhan population (17) , which will allow a direct comparison with our predictions.",

We thus modify SEIR model, to take into account social distancing (lockdowns, school and university closures, infection induced behavioral changes), consistent with drastic non-pharmaceutical interventions applied in PRC.

Parameter values were inferred by exhaustive search over a wide parameter range, to avoid reaching local minimum of the objective function (R 2 ). To infer the unknown parameters, we fit (by minimizing R 2 ) \u03b5\u03b1-SEIR to the observed total number of detected D t for each province. How different properties of D t curve determine the unknown parameters? Early in the infection, almost the entire population is susceptible (S\u2248N), so Eqs. (2) and (3) become linear, and decoupled from the rest of the system. This sets the ratio of I 0 to E 0 , through the eigenvector components with the positive eigenvalues of the Jacobian. Similarly, \u03b2 is set by the initial slope of log(D t ) curve. From Eq. (7) one can see that the product of I 0 and \u03b5\u00b7\u03b4 is set by t dD dt at the initial time (t=0). Later dynamics of the D t curve is determined by the combination t \u03b1 = t 0 + 1/\u03b1 (which we denote as protection time), setting the time at which ~1/2 of the population moves to the protected category. We also numerically checked this, i.e. t 0 can be lowered at the expense of increasing 1/\u03b1, without affecting the fit quality. Two independent parameters (I 0 and t \u03b1 ) have to be determined from the late infection dynamics. As social distancing depletes S, D t curve grows subexponentially, which may be quantified phenomenologically, e.g., through generalized-growth model, and the related growth parameter (24) , which sets t \u03b1 . D t curve saturates when the infected are depleted, so the saturation time depends on the scale (height) of the infected curve, which sets I 0,",

We observed this numerically, where I 0 can sometimes be decreased compared to the best fit value, without noticeably affecting the fit quality. We therefore checked this specifically for each province, and where possible (few provinces), we chose the lowest I 0 value that still leads to a comparably good fit.

In Fig. 2A and B, we show that our model can robustly explain the observed D t , in the cases of large outburst (Hubei on Fig. 2A) , as well as for all other provinces, where D t is in the range from intermediate (e.g., Guangdong) to low (e.g., Inner Mongolia). Provinces in Fig. 2B were selected to cover the entire range of observed D t (from lower to higher counts), while equally good fits were obtained for all other provinces, which were all included in the further analysis. Our method is also robust with respect to data perturbations (which might be frequent), e.g., in the case of Hubei (Wuhan), a large number of counts was added on Feb. 12 th , based on clinical diagnosis (CT scan) (2), which is apparent as a discontinuity in observed D t in Fig. 2A . The model however interpolates this discontinuity, finding a reasonable description of the overall data. We back propagated the dynamics inferred for Hubei, to estimate that January 5 th (\u00b14 days) was the onset of the infection exponential growth in the population (not to be confused with the appearance of first infections, which likely happened in December (2)). This agrees well with (2) (cf. Fig. 3A) , which tracked cases according to their symptom onset (shifted for ~12 days with respect to detection/diagnosis, cf. Fig.  3B ), and coincides with WHO reports on social media that there is a cluster of pneumonia caseswith no deathsin Wuhan (33) . Since our analysis does not directly use any information prior to January 23 rd , this agreement provides confidence in our I 0 (see above) estimate, on which depend our estimates of IFR and AFR below.",

That is, while there is a clear tendency that higher R 0 leads to higher suppression, Hubei is located in the upper right quadrant, characterized by both high transmissibility (R 0 ) and relatively low suppression effect (high t \u03b1 ). Two main properties of the Hubei outburst are therefore high R 0 and higher t \u03b1 compared to other provinces. In Fig. 3B , we investigate how these two properties separately affect the Wuhan outburst for latent and infected cases, where unperturbed Hubei dynamics is shown by the red full curve. We first reduce only R 0 from the Hubei value, to the mean value for all other provinces (the dash-dotted green curve). We see that reducing R 0 substantially reduces the peak of the curve, though it still remains wide. Next, instead of decreasing R 0 , we decrease the protection t \u03b1 to the mean value for all other provinces (dashed orange curve). While reducing t \u03b1 also significantly lowers the peak of the curve, its main effect is in narrowing the curve, i.e. reducing the outburst time. Finally, when R 0 and t \u03b1 are jointly reduced, we obtain the (dotted purple) curve that is both significantly lower and narrower than the original Hubei progression. This curve comes quite close to the curve that presents the sum of all other provinces (full blue curve) -the dotted curve remains somewhat above this sum, mainly because the initial number of latent and infected cases is somewhat higher for Hubei compared to the sum of all other provinces. The synergy between the transmissibility and the suppression measures, will be further discussed below.",

A naive explanation of the puzzle might be that closing Wuhan prevented the influx of the infected to other Chinese provinces. It was however previously shown that, at the start of the travel ban, most Chinese cities had already received many infected travelers (34) , which is also consistent with the fact that the initial number of detected (and our estimates of the infected) cases, were similar in Wuhan compared to the sum in all other provinces.",

This would enable detailed projections from the model, e.g., effects of preferentially protecting certain age group. However, the number of parameters increases as a square of the number of compartments (24) , which may be a major obstacle in the context of parameter inference. For example, in an individual-based model, parameters were jointly fitted to fatality counts from 11 different countries (35) , which is not feasible in our case, where parameters have to be estimated individually for each PRC province. Consequently, our approach is well suited for the problem considered, where population average parameters are to be separately estimated from individual time-series data.",

While lowering R 0 more significantly suppresses the peak, decreasing the halfprotection time significantly reduces the outburst duration. Consequently, the synergy of these two effects appears to lead to drastically suppressed infection dynamics in other Mainland China provinces compared to Hubei.

While CFR is more than five times larger for Hubei, the numbers appear much more self-consistent at the level of IFR, with Hubei comparable to other PRC provinces. We show that this is due to smaller testing coverage in Hubei, which appears to be consistent with known testing capacities (10000 tests per day in Hubei, vs. 40000 tests per day in all other provinces with significantly smaller total infection cases), and with WHO report on contact tracing in PRC provinces (36) . Despite that IFR appears consistent between the provinces, it does look unusual that for as many as 13 provinces (with otherwise huge population) there have been no reported COVID-19 fatalities. This suggests that a careful review (as done for Wuhan) might be needed, since some of the fatalities might be misclassified. However, even this is unlikely to significantly change our overall result of relatively low IFR coming from PRC epidemics. Ethnicity/racial factors might also contribute to low IFR in PRC, as we inferred the highest IFR (noticeably surpassing that of Hubei, even with the most recent revision) for Xinjiang province. Uyghur majority in Xinjiang have been genetically linked with mixed European/ West Asian (being dominant) and East Asian ancestry (37) , which in that respect might better reflect mortality in European and US hotspots. Overall, however, our study infers that COVID-19 in PRC has been a highly contagious disease, with transmissibility in-between those of influenza (R 0 ~ 1-2) (38) and measles (R 0 ~ 12-18) (39), and with IFR comparable to these two diseases (36, 40) , but with almost completely naive population even after the first infection wave (see below).
