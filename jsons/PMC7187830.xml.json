Human pathogenic viruses are often detected in water environments and are deemed to be responsible for a considerable proportion of waterborne diseases (Hamza and Bibby, 2019; Haramoto et al., 2018; La Rosa et al., 2012; Moreira and Bondelind; Rusinol, and Girones, 2017; WHO, 2017). Viruses of concern for their potential waterborne transmission belong mainly to the group of enteric viruses, a diverse group of non-enveloped viruses, which can multiply in the gastrointestinal tract of humans. They can be mostly responsible of gastrointestinal illness, but also of a wide spectrum of other diseases, such as conjunctivitis, respiratory symptoms, viral hepatitis, infections of the central nervous system.",

On the other hand, at a lower temperature (4 \u00b0C) they persist for 17 days. The same study showed that chlorine was more effective than chlorine dioxide in inactivating E. coli, f2 phage and SARS-CoV and a free residual chlorine of 0.5 mg/L from chlorine or 2.19 mg/L from chlorine dioxide in wastewater ensured complete inactivation of SARS-CoV. In the experimental conditions of the study, SARS-CoV was inactivated completely in presence of 10 mg/L chlorine and a minimum contact time of 10 min or in 1 min using 20 mg/L chlorine. Under the same conditions, E. coli and f2 phage were not inactivated effectively. This findings are of specific relevance since, according to the 4th edition of the World Health Organization\u2019s Guidelines for drinking-water quality, viruses are generally more resistant to free chlorine than bacteria (specifically, \u201cmoderate\u201d resistance for viruses, and \u201clow\u201d for the vast majority of bacteria) (WHO, 2017). The viruses considered of concern for water in WHO Guidelines, however, are principally enteric viruses (familes Adenoviridae, Astroviridae, Caliciviridae, Hepeviridae, Picornaviridae, and Reoviridae) which are, as previously reported, non-enveloped viruses. It is well known that these viruses are more resistant to environmental conditions, water treatments and disinfectants than enveloped viruses like coronavirus, as lysis of the viral envelope leads to the loss of functional receptors required for infection of susceptible cells (Wigginton et al., 2015). According to the results of Wang (2005a), SARS-CoV resistance to chlorine is lower than for bacteria. It follows that the current water disinfection practices (drinking water, wastewater, water from swimming pool), effective against non-enveloped viruses and bacteria, are expected to be effective also towards enveloped viruses such as coronaviruses.",

(2009) evaluated the survival of two surrogate coronaviruses, TGEV (transmissible gastroenteritis virus, a porcine coronavirus) and MHV (murine hepatitis virus), in reagent-grade water, lake water, and settled human sewage. Two temperatures were evaluated over 6 weeks: room temperature (23\u201325 \u00b0C), and 4 \u00b0C. In general, in all the water tested, the titer of infectious virus declined more rapidly at 25 \u00b0C than at 4 \u00b0C, confirming that temperature is an important factor affecting viral survival in water. At 25 \u00b0C, the time required for a 99.9% reduction (T99.9) in reagent-grade water was 33 days and 26 days for TGEV and MHV, respectively, while in pasteurized settled sewage it was 14 days and 10 days, respectively. On the other hand, no significant decrease of TGEV and MHV was reported in reagent-grade water at 4 \u00b0C after 49 days, and limited reduction was obtained at the same temperature in lake water after 14 days. Based on these results, the authors suggest that contaminated water may be a potential vehicle for human exposure if aerosols are generated. However, it is important to underline that the surrogate animal coronaviruses used in this study are responsible for gastrointestinal or hepatic diseases in animals and may therefore display a different resistance behaviour compared to respiratory human coronaviruses. This could explain the greater resistance and longer survival displayed by CoV in this work compared to the study of Wang and colleagues (2005a). Moreover, the use of different cell lines and growth media in these persistence studies might have contribute to measurement uncertainty.",

In wastewater, the tested CoV died off quite rapidly, with a T99.9 of 2.77\u20133.54 days at 23 \u00b0C. Significantly, the PV-1 lasted 2 to 3 times longer than CoV did, requiring 10.9 days for a comparable reduction in primary wastewater and 5.7 days in secondary effluents. In tap water, CoV reduction was slower than in wastewaters: at 23 \u00b0C, the T99.9 was 12.1\u201312.5 days for HCoV-229E and FIPV, while at 4 \u00b0C the same reduction was predicted (by modelling) to be achivable over 100 days. These yields highlight once again that virus survival decreases with increasing temperature. Similarly to the results obtained on wastewater, PV-1 survived six times longer than CoV in both filtered and unfiltered tap water, confirming the observation that non-enveloped viruses display higher resistance in water enviroments compared to enveloped viruses. Another important finding of the study was that CoV inactivation was faster in filtered tap water than unfiltered tap water, suggesting that suspended solids in water can provide protection for viruses adsorbed to these particles.",

Unpasteurized and pasteurized wastewater were spiked with the viral stocks and were then incubated at 25 \u00b0C or 10 \u00b0C to mimic typical summer and winter wastewater temperatures. Inactivation proceeded faster for the enveloped viruses: in unpasteurized wastewaters at 25 \u00b0C, the time to reach a 90% reduction (T90) was 13 h for MHV and 7 h phage \u03c66, compared to a predicted value of 121 h for the non-enveloped phage MS2. At 10 \u00b0C the inactivation kinetics of both MHV and \u03c66 were, once again, significantly slower than at environmental temperatures, with a T90 of 28\u201336 h. In pasteurized wastewater, both MHV and phage \u03c66 lost infectivity at a significantly slower rate compared to unpasteurized wastewater (T90 of 19 h for MHV and 53 h for phage \u03c66 at 25 \u00b0C), possibly due to the reduction of bacterial extracellular enzyme activity and the absence of protozoan and metazoan predation in pasteurized samples. Indeed, it was demonstrated that the presence of an indigenous microbial population has a negative impact on virus survival (Pinon and Vialette, 2018; Rzezutka and, Cook, 2004). Finally, in the same study, Ye et al., reported that up to 26% of the enveloped viruses adsorbed to the solid fraction of wastewater. That means that a reduction of enveloped viruses in wastewaters is provided by solid settling.",

Wastewater (250 ml for PEG precipitation and ultrafiltration and 60 ml for ultracentrifugation) was spiked with the rodent coronavirus Murine Hepatitis Virus (MHV) and with the non-enveloped phage MS2. Low mean recoveries (\u223c5%) were achieved for both MHV and MS2 with the ultracentrifugation method. This result was suggested to be related to virus inactivation by the high g-force of the ultracentrifugation. Recovery of MHV was low (\u223c5%) also with the PEG precipitation method, whose performance for MS2 concentration was instead significantly higher (43.1%). Finally, the optimized ultrafiltration protocol adopted in the study provided the highest recoveries for both viruses: 25.1% for MHV and 55.6% for phage MS2. Results of Ye and colleagues suggested that the PEG precipitation method, which is effective at recovering non-enveloped viruses from water samples, may be not optimal for recovering infective enveloped viruses, while ultrafiltration could be successfully applied for recovering CoV. However, in this study, only small volumes of wastewater were tested using centrifugal ultrafilters. Since viruses in water matrices may occur in very low numbers, there is a need for analytical methods suitable to process large volumes of water. It was therefore concluded by the authors that further progress could be made through the optimization of hollow fiber ultrafilters and tangential flow ultrafiltration to allow concentration of CoV in waters from larger volumes of water.",

Moreover, E. coli O157:NM, and Campylobacter jejuni were selected as bacterial pathogen. Three water turbidity levels were evaluated, prepared by mixing dried agricultural soil into the 20 L of water. After glass wool filtration, elution was performed with 3% beef extract-glycine buffer (pH 9.5), followed by flocculation with PEG 8000. Recovered organisms were enumerated by qPCR. Results showed that glass wool filtration is a cost-effective method for the concentration of several waterborne pathogens simultaneously. In details, the average recoveries (across the different turbidity levels tested) were: 18.1% for BoCoV, 22.1% for BoRV, 15.6% and 19.7% for BVDV1 and BVDV2 respectively. Higher recovery efficiencies were obtained for the non-enveloped virus Poliovirus 3 (57.9%), and for the bacterial microorganisms E. coli O157:NM (54.8%) and C. jejuni (32.7%). However, the authors advised to use caution in the interpretation of these comparative results since the quantity of pathogens used for spiking varied for the different microorganisms, precluding a clear differentiation of the effects on recovery efficiency of seeding quantities and pathogen type.",

The viruses used for the experimental procedures were Hepatitis A virus (HAV, non-enveloped) and the porcine coronavirus Transmissible Gastroenteritis Virus (TGEV). Large volumes of water (5 L and 50 L) were used for method optimization and performance characterization. Several steps of the elution procedure were modified compared to other published glass wool protocols to improve the recovery of TGEV and virus recoveries were ascertained by real-time qPCR. Recovery of the initial experiments (5 L of water, adsorption to the positively charged glass wool matrix, elution with glycine/beef extract buffer at pH 9.5 with 10 min of contact) showed that TGEV efficiently adsorbed onto the glass wool (attachment of 57.1%) but it was poorly eluted from it, with an overall recovery of 2.6%. The increase of buffer pH to 11.0 provided an improvement of elution efficiency, and a final recovery of 28.8%; further performance improvements could be obtained by changing the length of the elution incubation. Subsequent experiments for the concentration of HAV and TGEV from 50 L of spiked water samples were therefore all performed using an elution buffer pH 11.0. Results showed that addition of Tween 80 hampered the recovery of TGEV, possibly by damaging the lipid-containing envelope of viruses. Recirculation of the eluent at pH 11.0 for 20 min was instead beneficial to the elution, and provided recoveries of 18.0% and 23.9% for TGEV and HAV, respectively. Similarly, increasing PEG concentration from 10 to 20% in the secondary concentration, showed a significant improvement of the recovery (51.3% and 47.2% for TGEV and HAV, respectively). Following optimization of the method, the procedure provided a recovery efficiency of 5.1% for TGEV and 4.5% for HAV in spiked surface water. Overall, the study by Blanco et al. (2019) clearly demonstrated that the concentration procedures commonly used for non-enveloped viruses need adaptation to yield satisfactory performances on enveloped viruses like CoV.",

Further studies are needed to investigate CoV persistence in water in relation to climatic and seasonal conditions.3)Although different studies showed different viral inactivation rates for CoV in water, based on the type of virus and the type of water, generally, there is evidence that CoV is generally considered unstable in the environment and is more susceptible to oxidants, such as chlorine than non-enveloped viruses.4)Based on the few available data, methods commonly used to concentrate and recover non-enveloped enteric viruses from wastewater and other water matrices may not be appropriate to recover CoV. Therefore, future research should focus on the development of robust methods for concentrating CoV and other enveloped viruses from large volumes of waters and from different types of water.\n",
