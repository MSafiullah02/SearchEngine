Thus, the present study was conducted to estimate cumulative incidence of AE in CVD-IP, and to establish its clinical features.",

Each CVD was diagnosed according to established criteria.15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 A diagnosis of amyopathic dermatomyositis (ADM) was based on modified Euwer's criteria in our previous study21: (1) characteristic dermatological manifestations of classic dermatomyositis (DM), including a heliotrope rash and Gottoron's papules; (2) no muscle weakness; (3) no increase in serum muscle enzymes during the observation period. AE was defined using the criteria recently proposed by the IPF net, with slight modification for adaptation to CVD-IP6: (1) previous diagnosis of CVD-IP; (2) unexplained worsening or development of dyspnea within 30 days; (3) high-resolution CT (HRCT) with new bilateral ground-glass abnormality and/or consolidation superimposed on a background reticular or honeycomb pattern; (4) no evidence of pulmonary infection by negative respiratory culture, including endotracheal aspirate or bronchoalveolar lavage, and serological test results for respiratory pathogens; and (5) exclusion of alternative causes, such as left heart failure, pulmonary embolism, and an identifiable cause of acute lung injury. Patients with AE needed to meet all five criteria. The study protocol was approved by the Ethical Committee of the Hamamatsu University School of Medicine.",

Lung biopsy specimens were independently reviewed by three pathologists (T.V.C, Y.N., S.I.) who were unaware of the clinical or physiological findings. When classification differed between the pathologists (kappa coefficient of agreement = 0.40), a consensus opinion on the overall histopathological pattern was reached. Histological classification was based on the previously published criteria for idiopathic interstitial pneumonias from the American Thoracic Society (ATS)/European Respiratory Society (ERS) consensus statement.22 A histological pattern that could not be placed in any patterns described in the consensus statement was categorized as unclassifiable interstitial pneumonia. Sections stained with hematoxylin\u2013eosin were reviewed from all cases, and sections in which elastic tissue was stained were reviewed in selected cases.",

            "text": "The incidence of AE in IPF remains unknown. The reported incidence varies widely, because there are differences in the definition of AE, as well as differences in the populations studied. However, several prospective randomized control or retrospective longitudinal cohort studies have reported the likely incidence. Kim et al. indicated a 1-year incidence of 8.5% in a retrospective longitudinal cohort of 147 patients with biopsy-proven IPF.4 In a randomized controlled trial of pirfenidone, Azuma et al. reported a 9-month incidence of 14.3% in 36 placebo-treated patients.24 Taken together, the incidence of AE of IPF was estimated to be in the range of 5\u201319% per year.5 In CVD-IP, the present study revealed an overall incidence of 7.2%, with a mean 6.0 years follow-up, and a 1-year incidence of 1.25%. Compared with the reported incidence of AE of IPF, the incidence of CVD-IP appears to be lower. Among the underlying CVD, AE was found exclusively in patients with RA and pSS. Five of our six CVD-IP patients with AE had RA (overall incidence, 20.0%; 1-year incidence, 2.58%), and the other patient had pSS. Consistent with our observations, Park et al. described four CVD-IP patients who developed AE, and found that most of them (75%) had RA,13 although they did not mention the overall number for each CVD-IP. Collectively, these data suggest that patients with CVD-IP develop AE less frequently than those with IPF, and among CVD-IP, this condition is most common in RA.",

Parambil et al. have recently shown that acute respiratory deterioration in CVD-IP represented DAD pattern on the underlying chronic fibrotic processes, such as UIP and NSIP.9 As a result of severe respiratory failure, the second surgical lung biopsy at the onset of AE could not be performed in our patients, but an autopsy of one patient with NSIP revealed a DAD pattern superimposed on a background of an NSIP pattern (Fig. 3).

Interestingly, the serum levels of KL-6, a marker of interstitial pneumonia, were strikingly increased in all patients tested at the onset of AE.

This suggests that development of AE is not associated with deterioration of the underlying CVD, and can occur in patients in a stable condition. In addition, no data are available about the predictive factors for AE at the initial diagnosis.
