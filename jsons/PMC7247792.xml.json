Newly developed questions were piloted and refined with expert review before inclusion (appendix p 1). The final instrument included questions for hospital administrators; clinicians in the emergency department or, if there was no emergency department, the outpatient department; clinicians in the internal medicine ward; and clinicians in the ICU or high-dependency unit, if present. Clinician surveys for each ward were similar but were adjusted on the basis of the anticipated care activities at each location. At hospitals without an emergency department, the outpatient department was substituted as the most likely site to receive new patients. The sample size of nine district hospitals was determined as part of the broader MECC Survey, using methods recommended by the WHO Service Availability and Readiness Assessment.9 Eligible participants had to be aged 18 years or older, a staff member who had been working at the selected hospital for at least 1 month, and self-reported spending at least part of their time working in the hospital area corresponding to the survey section (ie, emergency department or outpatient department, general medical ward, high-dependency unit or ICU, or administration). Answers were recorded from three staff members at each targeted area in the hospital to allow for addressing discrepancies between participants' responses by averaging answers. All participants provided written informed consent. Ethics approval was obtained from the Partners Institutional Review Board (2019P003457) and Malawi's National Health Science Research Committee (protocol #19/05/2346, approval number: 2346). The Malawi Ministry of Health also approved the study. All hospitals were contacted by study staff in advance of the study team visit and granted approval for study participation through district-level research committees.",
