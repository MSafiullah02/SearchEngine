Many HCWs have no special training in infectious diseases and rely heavily on their employing institutions to communicate risks and assure their personal safety. Individual HCWs do not (generally) hold substantive responsibility for the cooperative action required to control the spread of infectious diseases. Surveillance and the implementation of risk mitigation measures require cooperative action. An outbreak is rarely curtailed by the actions of a single HCW. It is the engagement of multiple actors in coordinated action, often decided at a distance from the point of risk that determines the degree of risk. In the case of infectious disease, the adequacy of the coordinated response determines the risk to which an HCW, patients and community contacts are exposed. Individuals have little control of infrastructure, facilities, work-load, communication, training or teaching within the institutional context.",
