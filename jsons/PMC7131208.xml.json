Mature memory type lymphocytes are known to directly induce and guide the developments of the hematopoietic cells [1]. We propose that these cells be taken from elder individuals, whose immunity has seen them through many a battle with diseases over time, and be transfused in small quantities, sufficient to direct the development of other lymphocytes, into young infants. This, of course, is only after testing for blood group and other compatibilities.",
