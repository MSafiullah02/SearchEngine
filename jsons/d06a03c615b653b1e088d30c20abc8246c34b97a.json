We discuss the temporal aspects of social distancing in contrasting an epidemic diffusion. We argue that a strategy based uniquely on social distancing requires to maintain the relative measures for a very long time, while a more articulate strategy, which also uses early detection and prompt isolation, can be both more efficient on reducing the epidemic peak and allow to relax the social distancing measures after a much shorter time. We consider in more detail the situation in Italy, simulating the effect of different strategies through a recently introduced SIR-type epidemiological model. The short answer to the question in the title is: \"it depends on what else you do\".",

This is no surprise, and actually just confirms in terms of a mathematical model what has been preached theoretically, and implemented on the field in a most effective way, by the Padua group working on the first burst of infections in Veneto [5] , and later on inspiring the regional strategy for COVID. This strategy was specially successful so far, as shown by the numbers and in particular by the limited mortality in this region.",

In view of this remark, one has to expect that the inverse proportionality holds also without the assumption (R \u2212 R 0 ) \u226a \u03b3. This is indeed the case; showing this goes through use of the scaling properties of the SIR equations and of the integral in Eq. (7) when one reduces \u03b1 by a factor \u03bb > 1, i.e \u03b1 \u2192 \u03b1/\u03bb and increases \u03b2 by the same factor \u03b2 \u2192 \u03bb\u03b2. While under these transformations I * and R \u221e attain the same value, because they do not depend on \u03b1 and \u03b2 separately but only on their ratio \u03b3, the value of t * is reduced by a factor 1/\u03bb.

If by increasing \u03b2 we manage to bring \u03c1 below the threshold we simply stop the epidemic, but even if we do not go so far, we can still reduce the size of an epidemic keeping under control its timescale. This is an advantage when the sanitary system can cope with the epidemic, in that in this way the restrictive measures do not have to be implemented for too long. The situation is of course different if and when the sanitary system is overwhelmed by the epidemic (as it happened in the first phase of the COVID-19 diffusion in many countries or regions, also as a result of its unexpectedly fast spreading [11] ). In that situation slowing down the increase of the number of patients is an essential feature, and in this sense social distancing is an essential tool [13] .",

Summarizing, the computations in this subsection confirm the outcomes of our discussion above, and actually strengthens them in that they show these are valid also if we do not succeed in greatly raising \u03b2 and \u03b7, albeit of course the effect is stronger for higher raising factors \u03c3.",

After precious time has been obtained in this way, and when it comes to considering also the social and economic cost of a prolonged lockdown, the focus should shift to all possible means (respecting privacy and individual freedoms) of early detection and prompt isolation of infectives; so far the most effective means of achieving this is through tracing contacts, which may allow to isolate infectives before symptoms arise and thus to \"break the incubation time barrier\".",
