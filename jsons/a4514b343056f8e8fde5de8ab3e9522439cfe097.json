We have studied viral evolution at population level (competition on the same receptor) and at species level (competitions on different receptors). During the HIV infection, several mutants of the virus arise, which are able to use different chemokine receptors, in particular the CCR5 and CXCR4 coreceptors (termed R5 and X4 phenotypes, respectively). Phylogenetic inference of chemokine receptors suggests that virus mutational pathways may generate R5 variants able to interact with a wide range of chemokine receptors different from CXCR4. Using the chemokine tree topology as conceptual framework for HIV viral speciation, we present a model of viral phenotypic mutations from R5 to X4 strains which reflect HIV late infection dynamics.

Molecular phylogenetics has provided a statistical framework for estimating historical relationships among organisms, and it has supplied the raw data to test models of evolutionary and population genetic processes. Those have found practical uses in tracing the origins of pandemias and the routes of infectious disease transmission. Our ability to obtain molecular data has increased dramatically over the last two decades and large data sets describing a wide range of evolutionary distances are used in population genetic, phylogeny and epidemiological studies. Nevertheless, phylogenetic methods based on sequence information represent often an oversimplification when we aim at capturing the short time dynamics, i.e. the early stages of the speciation process. Population genetics focuses on this topic by investigating the behavior of mutations in populations. This discipline is related to the other important idea that Darwin expressed in The Origin of Species [1] , that the exquisite match between a species and its environment is explained with natural selection, a process in which individuals with beneficial mutations leave more offspring. Here we combine predictive quantitative theories of HIV evolution in the context of the selection pressure generated by the virus competition and the immune response. In particular phylogenies of the natural target of the HIV viruses, i.e. their cell receptors is combined with population genetics mathematical models. We show that combining the two leads to a better understanding of the complex molecular interaction underlying the macroscopically observable phenomena of HIV infection.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1119, "end": 1122, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "The smallest scale of molecular evolution generates genetic variability at population level. A special case is that of quasispecies which are clouds of very similar genotypes that appear in a population at mutation-selection balance [2] . Since the number of targets (the substrate) is limited, fitter clones tend to eliminate less fit mutants, which are subsequently regenerated by the mutation mechanism [3] . They are the combined result of mutations and recombination. Other sources of variability result from co-infection (simultaneous viral infection), superinfection (delayed secondary infection). On the contrary, selection and random drift decrease variability. The fact that deleterious or less fitted variants are not instantaneously counter selected allows for the coexistence and co-evolution of different strains of a virus within the same host. Although the conditions for the formation and survival of new strains have not always been understood, small scale evolution such as variability at population level may experience different mutation/selection balance than the genetic variability estimated from sequence analysis which represent fixed genotypes. Indeed, recent studies show that the rate of molecular evolution appears to accelerate when measured over evolutionary short timescales [4] , which strongly contrast with substitution rates inferred in phylogenetic studies. Molecular virology studies appear the natural benchmark, given that viruses have usually very high mutation rates and large populations. We aim at modelling viral multi strain short and long term evolutionary dynamics during the immune response. The multi strains can be thought as viral populations. Since there is a tremendous lack of studies attempting at integrating population and phylogenetic studies, our work represents the efforts to link speciation at small and large evolutionary scale.

During HIV infection, the process of adaptation requires interaction with CD4 T cell and a chemokine receptor, either CXCR4 or CCR5. During early stages of HIV-1 infection, viral isolates most often use CCR5 to enter cells and are known as R5 HIV-1. Later in the course of HIV-1 infection, viruses that use CXCR4 in addition to CCR5 (R5X4) or CXCR4 alone (X4 variants) emerge in about 50% patients (switch virus patients) [5, 6] . These strains are syncytium-inducing and are capable of infecting not only memory T lymphocytes but also na\u00efve CD4+ T cells and thymocytes through the CXCR4 coreceptor. The switch to use of CXCR4 has been linked to an increased virulence and with progression to AIDS, probably through the formation of cell syncytia and killing of T cell precursors. X4 HIV strains are rarely, if ever, transmitted, even when the donor predominantly carries X4 virus. CXCR4 is expressed on a majority of CD4+ T cells and thymocytes, whereas only about 5 to 25% of mature T cells and 1 to 5% of thymocytes express detectable levels of CCR5 on the cell surface [7] . It is noteworthy that X4 HIV strains stimulate the production of cellular factor called Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF), which is associated with immune hyperstimulation, a state often implicated in T-cell depletion [8] .

By comparing the modelled value with the mean time inferred by the phylogenetic tree, we may tune the those model parameters to give the correct time of appearance of the X4 phenotype. In Fig. 5 we observe the results of the stimulated production of TNF. Indeed, this regulate the interactions between immune response and the virus and between the different strains of HIV virus. The results of these interactions are a decline in T-cells level, leading to the AIDS phase of the disease, and the decline in levels of viruses using the R5 coreceptor. In the figure the temporal evolution of the infection is shown, with the appearance of the X4 strain, and the successive decline in T-cells abundances. By using this model it is also possible to predict some scenarios in HAART treatment (see Fig. 6 ). This therapy is usually able to decrease the concentration of the virus in the blood and delay the X4 appearance. We have found time dynamics similar to those reported in [31] ; see also [32, 33] . Note that our model considers only the HIV virions which are in the blood. The clearance of virions hidden in cells or other tissues are known to be very slow [34, 35] . Now we investigate what may happen in the case of a sudden interruption in the use of the drugs. In Fig. 6 we observe how the X4 strain may appear sooner, if the different R5 strains experience the same selection pressure. In fact during the treatment the concentration of the different strains of R5 viruses is kept to a very low level while T-cell abundances increase. As the therapy is interrupted, all the strains give rise to a renewed infection.

On the other hand is worth noting that if the new R5 inoculum take place before the X4 appearance, this may speed up the switching to the X4 phenotype if the new strain is mutationally close to the X4. which bind other chemokine receptors. This hypothesis also suggests that R5late strains in not-X4 AIDS, which are known to be different from R5 early strains, may have accumulated mutations enabling them to interact with other chemokine receptors. Therefore, our model suggests the sooner the HAART the better, because the presence of a large number of R5 will increase the mutational spectra in R5 strains (late R5) and the probability of getting closer to the binding specificities of other chemokine receptors. Contrary to our phylogenetic statistical analysis, our mathematical model describes short term evolutionary dynamics through competitions among viruses at each tips of the tree. Following Kimura, we can subdivide mutations into advantageous, neutral or deleterious where the deleterious can be further subdivided into the proportions that are very slightly deleterious, and deleterious. Deleterious mutations are not expected to become fixed in large populations, but nevertheless can persist in the population for long periods of time. The average time before loss correlates with deleteriousness. Thus, as observation times diminish, we should observe a greater proportion of slightly deleterious mutations that have yet to be lost, with the most deleterious observed only in the short-term pedigree studies. For some reasons, the evolutionary continuum between variation at population genetics level and the long-term evolution has not been adequately studied. Although it is a continuum, the techniques required may change as the timescale decreases. For example, some concepts from long-term evolution (binary evolutionary trees with sequences studied only at the tips) have been extended into populations where trees are no longer binary, and ancestral sequences (at internal nodes) are still present in the population. There are hints that a formal multi-scale study is necessary.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "R5 to X4 Switch and HAART Therapy"}, {"text": "The interest in HIV strain is motivated by concern about developing strain specific drugs.

If we focus on a quasispecies fitness landscape, the fitness' main component is probably related to the entrance of the virus in the cell, i.e. the interaction with the receptor. Other components are the budding characteristics and numerosity and the spectrum of mutants (hopeful monsters) generated. Therefore the height of the fitness curve mainly reflects the binding energy, while the windows of strain existence in the x axis reflects how many changes may still result in a sufficient binding. Our work may reveal relevant to phylogenetic studies on divergence date estimation which suffer from the difficulties of estimating the correct rate of molecular evolution for different branches. It is relatively straightforward to test if the data conform to a molecular clock . If the assumption of rate constancy does not hold across a tree and therefore the clock is rejected, however, the current methodology is lacking robustness in assessing the amount of relaxation from a clock hypothesis. Our approach in modeling the evolution of virus species is to investigate the different degree of competition among strains. Strains which are in the same fitness landscape have correlated rates of evolution. This agrees very well with the current use of local clock models which allow the molecular rate to vary throughout the tree, but with closely related species sharing similar rates. This approach is justified with the assumption that molecular rates are heritable because they are related to physiological, biochemical, and life-history characteristics of the species in question. That's precisely the idea of our local fitness landscape. Although the inference of rates is confounded by uncertainties in calibration points, by tree topology, and by asymmetric tree shapes, our present studies should be considered a theoretical framework for understanding how different smooth fitness landscapes which can be imagined at the leaves and nodes of a phylogenetic tree are linked by the topology and branch lengths reflecting a multiscale stepwise process of adaptation under natural selection.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "R5 to X4 Switch and HAART Therapy"}], "bib_entries": {"BIBREF0": {"ref_id": "b0", "title": "On the origin of species, 1859", "authors": [{"first": "C", "middle": [], "last": "Darwin", "suffix": ""}], "year": 1988, "venue": "", "volume": "", "issn": "", "pages": "", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF1": {"ref_id": "b1", "title": "The error threshold", "authors": [{"first": "C", "middle": ["K"], "last": "Biebricher", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "M", "middle": [], "last": "Eigen", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2005, "venue": "Virus Res", "volume": "107", "issn": "", "pages": "117--144", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF2": {"ref_id": "b2", "title": "The hypercycle", "authors": [{"first": "M", "middle": [], "last": "Eigen", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "P", "middle": [], "last": "Schuster", "suffix": ""}], "year": 1977, "venue": "Naturwissenschaften", "volume": "64", "issn": "", "pages": "541--565", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF3": {"ref_id": "b3", "title": "Rapid turnover of plasma virions and CD4 lymphocytes in HIV-1 infection", "authors": [{"first": "D", "middle": [], "last": "Ho", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "A", "middle": ["U"], "last": "Neumann", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "A", "middle": ["S"], "last": "Perelson", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "W", "middle": [], "last": "Chen", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "J", "middle": ["M"], "last": "Leonard", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "M", "middle": [], "last": "Markowitz", "suffix": ""}], "year": 1995, "venue": "Nature", "volume": "373", "issn": "", "pages": "123--126", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF4": {"ref_id": "b4", "title": "Coevolution of RANTES sensitivity and mode of CCR5 receptor use by human immunodeficiency virus type 1 of the R5 phenotype", "authors": [{"first": "I", "middle": [], "last": "Karlsson", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "L", "middle": [], "last": "Antonsson", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "Y", "middle": [], "last": "Shi", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "M", "middle": [], "last": "Oberg", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "A", "middle": [], "last": "Karlsson", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "J", "middle": [], "last": "Albert", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "B", "middle": [], "last": "Olde", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "C", "middle": [], "last": "Owman", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "M", "middle": [], "last": "Jansson", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "E", "middle": ["M"], "last": "Fenyo", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2004, "venue": "J.
