Children who are likely to suffer permanent intestinal failure and benefi t from intestinal transplantation include those with a remaining small bowel length of less than 30-40 cm, absence of the ileocecal valve, colonic resection and malabsorptive syndromes. Indications for transplant include frequent severe bouts of catheter associated sepsis, threatened loss of vascular access and the development of liver cirrhosis from cholestasis. Children who are more likely to experience cholestasis from total parenteral nutrition include those who experience persistent hyperbilirubinemia (greater than 6 mg/dl despite enteral nutrition), those with recurrent sepsis and/or bacterial overgrowth and those with minimal tolerance of any enteral feeds in the fi rst few months post resection. The 1 year survival rate after intestinal transplantation has markedly improved over the last several years but long term survival rates have remained unchanged. The improved short term survival rates have led to an increased prevalence of this patient population in intensive care units. Management of intestinal and multivisceral transplant recipients is uniquely challenging because of complications arising from the high incidence of transplant rejection and its treatment. In the ICU, the complexity of medical care for the transplant recipient requires a multidisciplinary approach with coordination by an intensivist in collaboration with the transplant surgeon, gastroenterologist, and other specialists.",

Each year nearly 200 individuals undergo intestinal transplantation and approximately one half of recipients are less than 18 years of age [ 1 ] . At the end of 2007, there were nearly 400 living pediatric intestinal transplant recipients [ 1 ] . Management of intestinal and multivisceral transplant recipients is uniquely challenging because of complications arising from the high incidence of graft rejection and its treatment. When performed in a young, immunologically naive population the likelihood of post-transplant life threatening infections is high. Long-term co-morbidities, such as diabetes, hypertension, chronic kidney failure, and neurological sequelae, also develop in this patient population, especially as shortterm survival improves. Thus, the medical care of intestinal transplant recipients may involve the management of insuffi ciency of every organ system.",

Children who are more likely to experience TPN-induced cholestasis include those who experience persistent hyperbilirubinemia (greater than 6 mg/dL despite enteral nutrition), those with recurrent sepsis and/or bacterial overgrowth, and those with minimal tolerance of any enteral feeds in the fi rst few months post resection [ 4 , 5 ] . Indications for transplant include frequent severe bouts of catheter-associated sepsis and threatened loss of vascular access [ 4 ] . Children should be referred for transplant evaluation when they experience liver fi brosis, a sustained bilirubin elevation over 5 mg/dL, signs of portal hypertension, and loss of 50 % of vascular access sites. A ratio of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) to platelet count greater than 1.5 was associated with the early development of fi brosis and may be used to guide the timing of listing for isolated intestinal transplantation [ 6 ] . Children with malabsorptive conditions such as micro-villous inclusion disease, tufting enteropathy and mega-cystic microcolon intestinal hypo-peristalsis syndrome should also be referred to a transplantation center as they have no intestinal rehabilitation potential [ 4 , 5 ] . Waiting times for an isolated intestine allograft are much shorter than waiting times for a liver allograft [ 3 ] . Children who are ill enough to require hospitalization at the time of transplantation have a higher mortality than those waiting at home. Over the last several years short term survival rates have improved and fewer children are noted to be in the hospital at the time of transplantation, likely due to earlier referral [ 1 ] .",

Contraindications include profound neurologic defi cits, non-correctable life-threatening conditions that are not related to liver and intestinal failure, immunodefi ciencies, non-resectable malignancies, multisystem autoimmune disorders, and insuffi cient vascular access [ 4 ] . Cancer survivors must be 5 years out from their last treatment and cleared by an oncologist before being considered transplant candidates. Co-morbidities are common in intestinal transplant candidates. At the University of Miami, the most common cause of intestinal failure for pediatric intestinal transplant is gastroschisis (27 %) followed by necrotizing enterocolitis (20 %) [ 8 ] . These specifi c conditions are associated with prematurity, prolonged hospitalization, colonization with resistant pathogens, chronic lung disease, failure to thrive, poor vascular access, limited abdominal capacity, and poor nutrition. In adult transplantation, mesenteric thrombosis is a common primary diagnosis and a coexisting hypercoaguable state may lead to additional complications [ 8 , 9 ] .",

Renal function should be evaluated to determine if a kidney should be included in the graft. Serologic tests for HIV, hepatitis B and C are required. Every effort is made to bring the child into compliance with vaccination recommendations before transplant. The complete pre-transplant evaluation should be available to the intensivist.

Isolated intestinal transplantation has an advantage over combined transplants in that the intestine can be explanted should severe rejection or other complications such as posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) arise. With this scenario, the patient becomes TPN dependent once again and immunosuppression is stopped. If the child has significant hepatic fi brosis or liver dysfunction and a liver transplant is required, it is recommended that the transplantation of the liver is performed at the time of intestinal transplantation. A combined liver and intestinal transplant may include the duodenum and pancreas, whole or in part, for technical reasons [ 2 ] . The term multivisceral transplantation applies to the en bloc replacement of liver, pancreas, stomach, and small intestine after evisceration of native abdominal organs including the spleen; however, there is great variability in the extent of transplantation of other organs such as the spleen and proximal colon [ 2 , 3 , 8 , 10 ] . Colonic transplantation was once thought to be associated with higher infection rates, but this appears to no longer be true and colonic transplantation may reduce fl uid losses [ 8 , 11 , 12 ] . A modifi ed multivisceral transplantation refers to en bloc transplantation of multiple abdominal organs excluding the liver [ 8 , 9 ] . To simplify clinical research, some scientists have recommended that procedures be categorized as intestinal transplant with or without liver transplant and the term multivisceral be abandoned [ 3 ] .",

In fact, hypertension is more frequent than hypotension in these patients related to corticosteroids, IV calcineurin inhibitors, and hypervolemia. Hypertension is typically managed by short-acting calcium channel blockers [ 2 ] . Frequent assessment of serum lactic acid concentrations can also guide fl uid therapy. Oncotic pressure is often low as evidenced by hypoalbuminemia, and albumin supplementation may be benefi cial. The large aortic anastomosis reduces the risk of hepatic artery thrombosis seen in isolated liver transplantation. Still, there are concerns about intestinal perfusion. Therefore, the hemoglobin is maintained at around 9-10 mg/dl and mild abnormalities of coagulation are not corrected [ 2 ] . Platelet counts are typically as low as 40,000 without evidence of bleeding and are not corrected. The color of the stoma must be frequently observed. When combined with a small abdominal compartment, abdominal distension may compromise diaphragmatic excursion and functional residual capacity. If there is any question of intra-abdominal hypertension, bladder pressure should be measured [ 2 ] . Typically capillary leak begins to subside 24 h postoperatively. At this time IV fl uids can be gradually decreased. Postoperative ileus generally persists for several days, so continuous gastric suctioning is necessary to reduce intraluminal pressure. Most centers begin feeding around the fi fth postoperative day upon detection of bowel sounds and stoma output but a few wait until 10-14 days postoperatively [ 13 ] . Short peptide-based isotonic formulas are infused at small but increasing volumes, while optimal intake is supported by parenteral nutrition [ 13 ] . Due to lymphatic disruption, absorption of fat as chylomicrons is impaired until collateral channels reform at around 180 days postoperatively [ 13 ] . Some centers supplement with intralipids or medium chain triglycerides and fat soluble vitamins [ 13 ] . It is not unusual to have high ostomy output. This can be controlled with anti-peristaltic agents such as loperamide and diphenoxylate in high doses.",

The incidence of abdominal compartment syndrome has been reduced by staged closure of the abdomen [ 15 ] . Other complications include portocaval thrombosis, biliary leak, wound dehiscence, intra-abdominal bleeding, failed abdominal closure, and fi stula formation [ 2 , 14 ] . Rarely, mycotic aneurysm at the aortic anastomosis can occur due to a relatively high level of contamination of the surgical fi eld.

Intestinal and multivisceral transplants differ from other solid organ transplants because of the complex interaction between the intestinal allograft and the native immune system, including the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) of the bowel mucosa [ 16 ] . There is evidence that enterocytes have the capacity to function as antigen presenting cells resulting in stimulation of donor lymphocytes [ 17 ] .

However, the use of Campath-1H in pediatric transplant recipients was associated with signifi cantly higher morbidity and mortality due to infection in children younger than 4 years [ 21 ] . Maintenance immunosuppression consists of the calcineurin inhibitor tacrolimus (Prograf \u00ae , Fujisawa Pharmaceuticals, Deerfi eld, IL) and steroids. The initial tacrolimus target whole blood trough concentration measured at 12 h also varies by center but is generally over 10 ng/mL for the fi rst 3 months. Subsequently, concentrations are kept slightly lower, 8-12 ng/mL [ 1 -3 , 8 , 9 ] . High dose steroids are given intraoperatively (up to 50 mg/kg) and tapered over the fi rst 4 days. Maintenance steroid management also varies by center, some reduce the steroid dose 2-4 weeks after transplant, and others reduce the steroid dose 6-9 months after transplantation [ 1 ].

Plasma citrulline, synthesized exclusively by enterocytes of the small intestine, has been used as a biomarker of intestinal mass and function in patients with intestinal failure [ 30 , 31 ] . Several recent studies have shown a strong correlation between lower plasma citrulline concentrations and grade of rejection [ 32 -34 ] . Using a citrulline concentration cutoff point of 13 \u03bcmol/L for moderate or severe ACR, the sensitivity was 96 %, but specifi city was only 69 %. A plasma citrulline concentration of more than 13 \u03bcmol/L excluded moderate and severe ACR with greater than 99 % certainty [ 33 ] . Because normal plasma concentrations of citrulline take up to 3 months to achieve after intestinal transplant, this assay is not useful in the fi rst weeks post-transplant [ 34 ] . Moreover, plasma citrulline concentrations decrease only after epithelial destruction, which makes it less useful as an early marker of rejection.",

In a recent retrospective study, chronic rejection was diagnosed in approximately 20 % of isolated intestinal transplants and 5 % of multivisceral transplants [ 45 ] . The reason for the lower incidence of rejection in the latter group is unclear. Some investigators hypothesize that it is due to the protective effect of the liver or the preceding evisceration and thus decreased recipient lymphocyte population. Patients typically present with abdominal pain, chronic diarrhea, and weight loss. Major histological features of chronic rejection are nonspecifi c and include progressive obliterative arteriopathy, apoptosis, mural fi brosis and perivascular infl ammation. In multivisceral transplants, the pancreas might be the organ most susceptible to chronic rejection [ 45 ] . Currently, re-transplantation is the only defi nitive treatment for chronic rejection with graft failure [ 46 ] , but if chronic rejection is an antibody mediated process there are potential new therapeutic approaches [ 40 ] . Bortezomib, a proteasome inhibitor used in the treatment of multiple myeloma, causes apoptosis in plasma cells, thereby decreasing alloantibody production. It has been found to be useful in treating antibody mediated rejection in kidney transplant recipients and may become a promising agent in the treatment of rejection after intestinal and multivisceral transplantation [ 47 ] . A recent case report showed successful reversal of refractory rejection with bortezomib in a patient following multivisceral transplantation [ 48 ] . Similarly, blockade of terminal complement activation by eculizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody with high affi nity for C5, appeared effective in a case report of ACR in a kidney transplant recipient [ 49 ] .",

These viruses have a predilection for the graft and therefore may be activated latent infections from donor derived tissues [ 60 ] . Cytomegalovirus infection occurs in 30 % of recipients, while adenovirus is reported in 20 % of recipients [ 61 -63 ] . The use of antiviral prophylactic strategies has made herpes virus infections uncommon, but the use of reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays for the detection and monitoring of viral DNA has identifi ed other pathogens, including polyoma viruses such as BK virus and paramyxoviruses such as parainfl uenza and metapneumovirus [ 38 , 64 ] .

In one single center, pneumonia related respiratory failure occurred in 18 % of patients and was associated with younger age and higher mortality [ 8 ] . Due to a lack of published data on respiratory failure in intestinal transplant recipients, extrapolation of management principles from other immunocompromised populations is required. Optimal outcome depends on identifying the cause of the lung infi ltrate through analysis of tracheal fl uid, bronchoalveolar lavage fl uid or tissue obtained from open lung biopsy and instituting specifi c therapy at the earliest possible time [ 67 -69 ] . In a prospective cohort of 200 immunocompromised patients with infi ltrates, infectious agents were recovered in over three fourths of all subjects [ 67 ] . While some viral infections such as infl uenza and RSV can be detected via immunofl ourescence assay or culture from nasopharyn-geal washing samples, the detection of common respiratory viral pathogens has been improved by use of RT-PCR applied to nasopharyngeal and endotracheal samples [ 64 , 70 , 71 ] . Through this technology, community acquired viruses such as infl uenza virus, parainfl uenza virus, adenovirus and rhinovirus have been increasingly recognized as major causes of serious lower respiratory illness in transplanted children (Table 30 .2 ). Due to the diminished infl ammatory response in immunocompromised patients typical radiologic appearance for any infectious agent may be absent [ 72 ] . In half of adults with neutropenia and in adult kidney transplant recipients computed tomography images revealed lesions not visualized on plain radiographs [ 71 -74 ] . Studies have shown that in 70-86 % of mechanical ventilated patients, information obtained from open lung biopsy resulted in significant changes in management [ 75 -77 ] . Because viral killing requires T-cell activation and therefore leads to severe pneumonia, immunosuppression needs to be profoundly reduced and even withheld for several days to allow immunologic recovery while increasing monitoring of the graft [ 2 ] .",

In addition, a small abdominal compartment may be compromised by intra-abdominal hypertension with even a small increase in intestinal air. Once intubated, sedation can be diffi cult in this population and higher doses of sedatives are required either because of upregulated drug clearance enzymes or a high liver mass to body weight ratio. Typically, when plateau pressures are greater than 30-35 cmH 2 O we have implemented high frequency oscillatory ventilation.

Blood stream infection occurs more frequently in recipients of intestinal transplantation than in other types of solid organ transplantation [ 26 ] . This is mainly due to the presence of bacterial fl ora along the lumen of the allograft, enterocyte injury during rejection, the higher amount of immunosuppressive therapy, and the development of lymphoproliferative disorder [ 26 , 79 , 80 ] . Enteric bacteremia is an indication for endoscopic evaluation and biopsy of the graft to rule out rejection. As shown in multiple studies, early initiation of antibacterial therapy has had a direct effect on reducing mortality in sepsis and a transplant recipient should receive empiric antibiotics whenever febrile [ 81 -83 ] . This includes coverage for enteric gram negative and gram positive organisms such as Enterococcus spp . Antifungal coverage may also be appropriate. Early goal-directed therapy requires intravenous access for fl uid resuscitation and vasoactive therapy, ongoing patient assessment, and normalization of the physiologic parameters mean arterial pressure and mixed venous oxygen saturation; this approach results in a decrease in both in-hospital and overall mortality [ 84 , 85 ] . A state of absolute or relative adrenal insuffi ciency has been well described in sepsis [ 85 ] . Transplant recipients are at greater risk due to long-term steroid use. Therefore, stress-doses of hydrocortisone with or without fl udrocortisone should be administered.

Predictors of renal dysfunction include low pretransplant glomerular fi ltration rate (GFR), critical illness prior to transplant, and high-dose tacrolimus therapy [ 86 ] . At the time of transplant many recipients have already has a decline in GFR, on average to 83 % of the norm [ 86 ] . Although this renal dysfunction appears relatively mild, it predisposes to further decline of the kidney function after transplantation due to lower renal reserve. Post-transplant, recipients receive prolonged therapy with the nephrotoxic calcineurin inhibitors, tacrolimus or cyclosporine [ 87 -89 ] . A higher incidence of infections mandates exposure to nephrotoxic antimicrobials. Other common complications post-transplantation also contribute to an increased risk of renal dysfunction, e.g. hypoperfusion, dehydration, chronic hypertension, diabetes mellitus, infection with BK virus and dyslipidemia. The overall incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI) after adult solid organ transplantation is approximately 25 % with 8 % requiring renal replacement therapy [ 90 ] . In the intestinal/multivisceral transplant patients, acute tacrolimus toxicity is a common cause of AKI. This is in part due to an erratic intestinal absorption of tacrolimus and its metabolism by enterocytes. In the face of low renal reserve, whole blood tacrolimus concentrations over 20 ng/mL are associated with elevated serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and oliguria [ 90 ] . Various vasoregulatory molecules, including endothelin and adenosine, are involved in calcineurin inhibitor related renal artery vasoconstriction [ 90 ] . Hence, acute tacrolimus toxicity frequently does not respond to diuretic therapy. Fenoldapam, a selective dopamine-1 receptor agonist that decreases vascular resistance while increasing renal blood fl ow, preserves renal function by counter-balancing the renal vasoconstrictive effects of cyclosporine in kidney and liver transplant patients [ 91 , 92 ] . Aminophylline, a nonselective adenosine receptor antagonist, enhanced the response to loop diuretic in pediatric abdominal organ transplant recipients [ 93 ] .",

Furthermore, extracorporeal circuit volumes comprising more than 10-15 % of patient blood volume must be primed with whole blood to avoid hypotension and anemia, yet the bradykinin release syndrome (BRS) with acute hypotension is often associated with blood priming of the circuit [ 96 ] . Because multivisceral transplant patients are often poor candidates for hemodialysis, AKI must be prevented by close monitoring of tacrolimus concentrations and renal function, and avoidance of nephrotoxic drugs and hypoperfusion.",

Donor antibody-induced hemolysis in ABOmismatched solid organ transplantation is usually mild and self-limiting, [ 117 ] whereas alloimmune hemolytic anemia due to antibodies with anti-D (Rhesus) specifi city can be severe needing multiple transfusions [ 116 ] . Passenger lymphocyte syndrome can also affect the platelet count. Severe and resistant alloimmune thrombocytopenia with alloantibodies from passenger donor lymphocytes directed against the HPA1a-platelet antigen was demonstrated in three patients receiving kidney or liver transplantation [ 118 ] . Lacaille and coworkers described six children who developed severe antibody-mediated anemia or thrombocytopenia while treated with tacrolimus after liver or intestinal transplantation [ 119 ] . All patients had positive anti-platelet antibodies or Coombs' positive anemia. The authors suspected interference of tacrolimus with T-cell function or with endogenous control mechanisms of T-cell activation and down-regulation as the underlying mechanism. Therapy was successful with steroids or anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody [ 119 ] . In a more recent case series, four children who had undergone combined liver and bowel transplantation developed autoimmune-hemolytic anemia. Three of the four children also developed thrombi in major vessels suggesting that anticoagulation should be used when this condition presents [ 120 ] .",

            "text": "Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a herpes virus that can infect several cell lines including lymphocytes and has been associated with different malignancies, including posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorders (PTLD), a group of heterogeneous lymphoproliferative diseases arising in the pharmacologically immunosuppressed population [ 124 , 125 ] . Seronegative EBV status at time of transplant is a risk factor for PTLD, hence children are at increased risk compared to adults [ 126 ] . Generally, the risk of PTLD corresponds with the duration and intensity of the immunosuppressive therapy [ 126 ] . Specifi cally, the use of anti-T-cell antibodies for induction and rejection exposes intestinal recipients to a higher risk of PTLD compared to other solid organ graft recipients. The incidence is reportedly 5-10 % for intestinal recipients and appears to be higher for multivisceral recipients [ 21 , 38 , 127 ] . Quantitative PCR improves detection and serial monitoring of EBV viral load in peripheral blood [ 120 , 127 -129 ] . Since the rise of EBV viral loads often precedes the development of PTLD, have EBV DNA PCR is routinely monitored [ 128 ] . Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders can occur at any time, with the highest incidence occurring in the fi rst year after transplantation [ 38 , 124 ] . A high index of suspicion is needed since the clinical presentation is often nonspecifi c including symptoms of fever, fatigue and weight loss. Total body imaging studies with computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or positron emission tomography (PET) scan are necessary for staging of PTLD [ 130 ] . Biopsy of the accessible nodal tissues is essential, since histopathologic examination remains the gold standard for diagnosing PTLD [ 130 ] . Gastrointestinal tissue sampling may be useful in the absence of a biopsy from lymph nodes, but a negative result does not rule out the disease.",

Cyclosporine and tacrolimus can cause a wide variety of symptoms including encephalopathy and seizures [ 141 -145 ] . The diagnosis of immunosuppressant-related neurotoxicity is based on exclusion of other causes in addition to a possibly elevated serum drug concentration, but neurotoxicity can occur even without elevated serum concentrations. Treatment consists of lowering the dose or using an alternative immunosuppression. Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) is associated with calcineurin inhibitors and occurs in 0.5 % of all solid organ transplants. Characterized by headache, confusion, seizure and visual loss with a specific pattern in the MRI of the brain (Fig. 30.3 ) , PRES is frequently associated with hypertension [ 145 ] . Unrecognized, PRES may become irreversible with permanent sequelae [ 145 ] . The treatment again involves lowering the dose of the drug and treating the frequently associated hypertension. Only one adult study has examined the incidence and spectrum of neurologic complications after intestinal and multivisceral transplantation [ 146 ] . This retrospective analysis showed a high incidence of headaches (68 %), encephalopathy (43 %), and seizures (17 %) [ 146 ] . Less common were CNS infections, neuromuscular disorders, and ischemic stroke [ 146 ] . Use of ganciclovir for EBV and CMV prophylaxis appears to reduce the incidence of previously reported CNS infections. Table 30 .4 provides a summary of the pathogens specifically involved in CNS infection in transplant recipients [ 147 -151 ] . Neurologic complications in pediatric intestinal transplant have not been comprehensively reviewed but given the prolonged use of high dose immunosuppression are likely more common and complex than in other solid organ transplant populations. The long term survival rate has remained unchanged for many years because the risk of complications remains high. Bacterial infection and ACR remain the main complications limiting life expectancy, but longterm organ dysfunctions such as chronic kidney failure impact on morbidity and mortality as short term survival improves. Only ongoing collaboration between intensivists and transplant specialists will impact both short-term and long-term complications and improve quality of life. ",
