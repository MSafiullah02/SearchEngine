            "text": "The transformation of organ transplantation from an interesting experiment in human immunobiology to the most practical means of rehabilitating patients with a variety of forms of end organ dysfunction may be the outstanding clinical accomplishment of the biomedical revolution that has occurred over the last three decades. Indeed, the rate of one year graft survival at many centers for nonpulmonary allografts approaches and even exceeds 90%, with the comparable statistic for lung allografts being \u223c75%. Despite this success, 50\u201375% of transplant patients will have evidence of microbial invasion in the first year post\u2010transplant, with the consequences of such invasion being quite diverse, encompassing the following: direct consequences, in which the microbial invasion results in a variety of clinical infectious disease syndromes such as mononucleosis, pneumonia, gastroenteritis, hepatitis, etc. and indirect consequences, in which cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors elaborated by the transplant recipient in response to microbial replication and invasion contribute to the net state of immunosuppression, the pathogenesis of acute and chronic allograft injury, and even, in some cases, the development of malignancy. Given this array of clinical effects of infection in the transplant patient, the prevention (rather than the treatment of established clinical disease) has become a primary goal of practitioners of transplant infectious disease, and it is with this goal in mind that these guidelines have been prepared (1). In this analysis, the evidence\u2010based rating systems for both the strength of recommendations and assessment of the quality of the evidence established by the Infectious Disease Society of America (Tables 1 and 2) are employed (2). These guidelines should be regarded in two ways, as the present state of the art and as an outline of a research agenda for the coming decade.",

            "text": "\n1What is to be prevented by a particular intervention must be clearly defined; that is, are you concerned just with the prevention of clinical infectious disease syndromes, or are you also interested in the prevention of indirect consequences of infection. For example, a variety of regimens have been brought forth in an effort to prevent the direct manifestations of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection, with significant success. What is perhaps even more interesting are three separate reports suggesting that antiviral prophylaxis may have value in decreasing the incidence of acute and chronic allograft injury (1, 3, 4, 5).2The risk of infection in the solid organ transplant patient is largely determined by the interaction of three factors: technical/anatomic mishaps that involve the transplant procedure itself, and such perioperative aspects of care as the management of vascular access, drains, and the endotracheal tube; environmental exposures (Table 3); and the patient's net state of immunosuppression (Table 4). In the case of technical/anatomic mishaps, the best way to prevent infection is to correct the anatomic abnormality under coverage of appropriate antimicrobial therapy; antimicrobial therapy by itself will just extend the incubation period at the price of inducing resistance (1, 6).3When one is considering therapy in the transplant patient, the concept of the therapeutic prescription is very useful. This has two major components, an immunosuppressive component to prevent and treat rejection; and an antimicrobial component to make it safe. Thus, the nature of the antimicrobial program being administered must be closely linked to the nature and intensity of the immunosuppressive program required. \u2018One size does not fit all\u2019 (1, 6).4There are three modes in which antimicrobial agents can be administered to the transplant recipient: a therapeutic mode, in which antimicrobial agents are administered in the treatment of established clinical infection (not the primary focus of these guidelines); a prophylactic mode, in which antimicrobial agents are administered to an entire population before an event in order to prevent the occurrence of an infection important enough to justify this intervention: and a preemptive mode, in which antimicrobial agents are administered to a subpopulation noted to be at particular risk of clinically important infection on the basis of clinical, epidemiologic, or laboratory markers. These guidelines will focus both on preventive strategies (prophylactic and preemptive) and also on the diagnosis and management of established infection.5Infection in the post\u2010transplant period has a very stereotyped temporal pattern, a timetable; that is, although such clinical syndromes as pneumonia can occur at any time point post\u2010transplant, the etiology will be very different at different time points. Figure 1 delineates the timetable for organ transplants in the absence of antimicrobial intervention. When preventative antimicrobial therapy fails to protect, a common clinical effect is to extend the incubation period. For example, in the case of CMV infection, in the absence of prophylaxis CMV induced clinical disease is most common 1\u20133 months post\u2010transplant; when prophylaxis is used, but fails, it is common for the disease to occur 4\u20138 months post\u2010transplant (depending on the nature of the prophylaxis and the immunosuppressive regimen) (6, 7).\n",

In the first month there are three major causes of infection: (a) infection that was present in the recipient pretransplant, with its impact now increased as a result of surgery, anesthesia, and immunosuppressive therapy; (b) infection conveyed with a contaminated allograft; and (c) the same bacterial and candidal infections of the wound, lungs, drainage catheters, and vascular access devices seen in nonimmunosuppressed patients undergoing comparable surgery (although the impact tends to be greater in transplant patients). More than 95% of the infections occurring in the first month post\u2010transplant fall into this last category, with the number one factor determining the incidence of such infections being the technical skill with which the surgery and perioperative care is accomplished.2\nOne to six months posttransplant. In this time period there are two major classes of infection: (a) this is the time period when the immunomodulating viruses (cytomegalovirus, Epstein\u2010Barr virus, human herpesvirus\u20106, and the hepatitis viruses (B and C) exert their direct effects; and (b) the combination of sustained immunosuppression and immunomodulating viral infection creates a net state of immunosuppression great enough that such opportunistic infections as Listeria monocytogenes, Aspergillus fumigatus, and Pneumocystis jiroveci can occur without an especially intensive environmental exposure.3\nMore than six months posttransplant. These individuals can be divided into three categories: (a) the 80% of patients with a good result from transplantation (maintenance immunosuppression, good allograft function) are at greatest risk from community acquired respiratory viruses (e.g. influenza, parainfluenza, and respiratory syncytial virus); (b) the 10% of patients with chronic hepatitis infection will develop progressive liver failure and/or hepatocellular carcinoma unless effective antiviral therapy can be deployed; and (c) the 10% of patients with a poor outcome from transplantation (excessive acute and chronic immunosuppression, poor allograft function, and, often, chronic viral infection), a group that some experts have termed the \u2018chronic n\u2019er do wells', is at highest risk for opportunistic infection with such organisms as Pneumocystis jiroveci, Listeria monocytogenes, Cryptococcus neoformans, and Nocardia asteroides.\n\n",
