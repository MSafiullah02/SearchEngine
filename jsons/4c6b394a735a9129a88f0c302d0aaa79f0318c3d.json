In the face of those prognostications, more than 25 new infectious diseases were recognized for the first time between 1975 and 2000. These new scourges included HIV, Ebola, Legionnaire's Disease, Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, deadly new strains of influenza, and new forms of drug-resistant bacteria and malaria. Rather than nearing extinction as a broad class of human suffering, infectious diseases remain the leading cause of death worldwide. The ability of microbes to adapt to new pressures, including antibiotic usage coupled with changes in society, technology, and the environment make it likely that the microbial threat will remain a threat to humanity, and even suggests the possibility of regional and global epidemics comparable to the worst in history.",

There has been an increasing appreciation of their effects on international trade, the stability of families, institutions, and societies, and military readiness. Under this broader context, the control of infectious diseases is increasingly seen as a fundamental element of national security. Such considerations in the early 1990s prompted groups such as the National Academy of Sciences, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the World Health Organization (WHO) to develop plans for addressing and mitigating the threat of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases. The Department of Defense (DOD) figured heavily in the recommended actions from these deliberative bodies because of its wide spectrum of domestic and international assets for infectious disease surveillance, research, and control. These recommendations in June 1996 led to Presidential Decision Directive NSTC-7 on Emerging Infections. This directive formally expanded the mission of the DOD to support global surveillance, training, research, and response to emerging infectious disease threats.",

A complementary epidemiologic approach has been embraced by DOD-GEIS as key to maintaining a comprehensive, alert public health system.

Therefore any plan of defense against biological warfare sabotage requires trained epidemiologists, alert to all possibilities, and available for call at a moment's notice anywhere in the country.\" (1) The expectation is that early detection of emerging infections, to include deliberate biological attacks, will require a system of innovative techniques to detect a wide range of possible scenarios across a dispersed population. These may range from isolated cases, such as the anthrax letter attacks of Fall 2001, through small-scale events such as an attack against a group of people in a building or at a gathering, to a more extensive attack against one or more population centers. The mobility of modern society presents added challenges because cases from a common point infection may disperse across a community or even the globe. Case clusters would initially be undetectable at the level of clinicians or individual health care facilities but would require consolidation over larger catchment areas. Even more insideous, low-impact attacks may indicate \"experiments\" or failed attempts for a larger impact by a determined adversary. Thus, the goal is not only early detection of large and small outbreaks but also the rapid epidemiologic assessment of the situation so as to optimally deploy limited response assets and to empower civil leaders with credible information for risk communication to an anxious population. The DOD, as a result of having a singular global medical informatics backbone, is in a unique position to pioneer innovative approaches to community-based, near real-time detection of changes in health indicators. DOD-GEIS has made adaptation of these unique assets a feature of response to the President's call for enhanced public health surveillance, systems research, and integration.",

Therefore, one must have knowledge of existing disease rates, risk factors for these diseases, and the effectiveness of preventive measures. The first step in gaining this knowledge is a working surveillance system that rapidly allows the public health practitioner to know the health status of the community. Indeed, public health surveillance is a core element of public health practice. Unfortunately, most infectious disease surveillance systems are passive and rely on practitioners voluntarily reporting to the public health system (6) . Not only do reports often take weeks to months to receive, but gross underreporting is usually the norm. A recent review of reportable disease reporting in the US military revealed the Army centrally reported 45% of hospitalized reportable disease cases when compared to International Classification of Diseases, 9 th Revision (ICD9) discharge diagnoses during the period January-June 2001 (7) .The Navy and Air Force each reported 18% of these cases over the same time period (8, 9) . Additionally, most are based on laboratory results that, although improving the specificity of the report, increases the lag time between the onset of illness and the report being sent. In the previous review, of those diseases that were reported by the Army, 45% were reported within 1 wk of hospital discharge and 76% were reported within 1 mo (7) . For bioterrorism, if the notification of something unusual occurring reaches the health department quickly, then the investigation, treatment, prophylaxis, and preventive measures can be started that much sooner. In many instances, early response can allow significant improvements in morbidity, mortality, and decrease costs (10) . Therefore, we must improve our public health surveillance systems to allow rapid acquisition of important disease incidence information.",

This outbreak mimics a bioterrorist attack with an aerosolized agent. The situation was complicated by a population that dispersed after exposure, so cases appeared throughout the state. This can also happen with a bioterrorist attack and can confuse the investigation. In 2001, the index case of anthrax in Florida had recently traveled to North Carolina, which made the investigation and search for the source of infection that much more difficult. With the wide range of potential incubation periods inherent in agents that could be used for bioterrorism, similar scenarios should be anticipated.

However, to rapidly detect and respond to a nascent disease outbreak, quickly acquiring disease incidence data and analyzing it is of crucial concern. Although accuracy is not unimportant to disease outbreak investigations, the initial notification of a potential outbreak can be based on less accurate data, as long as it allows more in-depth investigation after the alert.

If this is the case, then certain preventive measures such as closing of schools, altering public gatherings, and so on, can be instituted even before the specific etiologic agent is identified. This was done during the influenza pandemic in 1918, before they knew the cause of the epidemic. Even with diseases of lower virulence, measures can be taken to decrease the potential spread of an illness, such as recommendations to confine new ill recruits to the hospital to decrease transmission in crowded barracks situations.

In particular, a specific microbiological diagnosis will be most helpful in instituting preventive measures. Often in clinical settings, especially with diseases of low severity, diagnostic specimens are not taken. If the disease is not severe, it is common practice to treat patients empirically and save time and money on laboratory tests that probably will not affect the outcome of the patient's illness, as the patient often recovers before the laboratory diagnosis is obtained. However, the first cases in a disease outbreak, if investigated, can provide crucial information to prevent or limit the spread of the outbreaks through proper treatment and prophylactic protocols. For example, the index case of anthrax in Florida had meningeal symptoms that prompted the physician to take cerebrospinal fluid for culture and Gram stain (14) . The use of diagnostic tests allowed a more rapid recognition of the cause of the disease and assisted with recognition of future cases and the institution of preventive measures. In this case, the disease presentation and severity contrib-uted to the taking of diagnostic specimens. In other disease outbreaks caused by pathogens such as Norwalk or influenza viruses, although there are appropriate preventive or treatment measures available, the lack of severity of the disease may result in few diagnostic tests performed. The result of this omission is that the outbreak can continue and future patients will not receive the most appropriate care as they could have with knowledge of the disease-causing agent. Nor will the most effective preventive measures be enacted at the earliest possible opportunity. Early indication of unusual disease patterns can allow health departments to request appropriate diagnostic tests on current and future patients in order to obtain the correct diagnosis quickly and improve the ability to prevent and treat future cases.",

Although the experience to date has been that these systems have the potential to provide very useful and timely information, they have had varying degrees of acceptance and utility. The greatest detriment has been the need for additional work for the healthcare provider to enter the information. A decrease in data entry resulting from providers' lack of time is often realized when the data is needed the most (e.g., during an outbreak situation). An additional problem for those used only during or after an event is the lack of pre-existing data for comparison. Surveillance systems need to provide more than a snapshot in time to be useful. In fact, the definition of surveillance includes the criteria of \"ongoing\" (16) . Public health surveillance must demonstrate change or lack of change in disease rates over time. Therefore, if a surveillance system is only used for a 2-to 3-wk time period, it will be very difficult to determine abnormal patterns of disease incidence because the baseline rate is not established.",

To make a direct comparison, we have figured the ESSENCE data in a similar format as the CDC data by calculating the percent of visits on a weekly basis for a respiratory illness. The average percent of patients with a respiratory complaint is higher than that seen with the CDC surveillance. This is expected, because they do not have to meet the same stringent ILI case definition. The codes included in the respiratory syndrome group are listed in Table 3 , which are less restrictive, as a patient only has to be diagnosed with one of these to be included. Regardless, the similarity of the epidemic curve is striking, and ESSENCE detects the influenza outbreak as well as more traditional data sources. The benefit of ESSENCE is that the data are received in 1-3 d and do not require additional work by the provider, whereas the CDC data are not available for public consumption for a longer period of time.

The data quality and predictive value positive, although still important, will be less important than for a specific reportable disease.

In particular, there are large government suppliers of health data, such as Medicare and Medicaid, that already have healthrelated databases that should be made available through a national plan. All state, local, and military health departments should assist in building a national network of information. Although a national system is needed, the information must still be viewed and interpreted locally.

Because laboratory diagnoses provide the most specific information in a infectious disease surveillance system, they are essential for accurate monitoring. Although lab-based surveillance is not yet very timely, it is still of critical importance, especially in the evaluation of specific preventive measures. In bioterrorism defense, laboratory surveillance allows the public health community to track the spread of certain types of disease agents and, therefore, understand what pathogens are circulating in a given area. In bioterrorism detection, new or unusual strains can potentially be a strong indicator that an intentional attack has occurred (29) . The strain of Salmonella causing illness in The Dalles, OR, in 1984 was one of the principal clues in determining that the outbreak was intentional (30) . With emphasis on cutting costs in healthcare, many patients are treated empirically without the benefit of microbiological diagnoses, especially when the illness is not severe or when the test result may arrive too late to benefit the patient (31) .

However, many of these new tests are performed on an ad hoc basis, may be unlicensed, and require specific expertise to run them. A system designed to optimize the delivery of advanced technology cannot rely on the physical presence of these capabilities at every level. However, an inventory of available resources that is updated and provides contact information and instructions on how to obtain reference testing can easily be made available through a Web-based system (39) . For this reason, the DOD-GEIS is developing a virtual public health lab directory to accomplish this mission.",

Some are research laboratories, whereas others are hospital-based. Within the research community, there are a large number of specialized tests that could be available, but there is no established DOD system to define or facilitate coordination or communication. Most hospital clinicians may have no idea that a DOD laboratory can provide a specific test, let alone how to contact them or send it. Several of these assays are not performed under the regulatory controls necessary for clinical laboratory certification, nor do they represent devices licensed by the Food and Drug Administration because of their research status. Along with improvements in the Web-based linkages, attention needs to be placed on validation of these procedures. In addition, the CDC and state and university laboratories can provide assistance in specialized areas, and may be easier to use as a result of proximity. However, there are no formal support agreements between DOD and state laboratories. During a time of crisis, lack of an established plan can result in confusion and wasted time.",

In addition, lines of communication must be opened within the DOD and with civilian partners to ensure the most prudent use of resources. The first step in addressing these concerns will be the release of the DOD virtual public health lab directory, a joint collaborative effort between the DOD-GEIS and the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology. In addition, efforts to archive and store clinical specimens of interest from those with known or potential infectious disease etiologies for future study is also being undertaken.",

            "text": "The US military has been involved with developing defenses against biological warfare for many decades. These efforts have featured research into vaccines, therapeutics, diagnostics, and various other countermeasures. Most of the doctrine developed has been based on battlefield scenarios in which deployed forces are arrayed against a defined enemy. However, the specter of biological terrorism on the homeland perpetrated by a unique set of actors with nontraditional agendas raises many new challenges to old defensive assumptions. One of these is the greatly increased challenge of defining, recognizing, and responding to an unexpected threat before its full consequences are felt. It is clear that with the homeland as a potential target, some of the approaches to threat mitigation that are appropriate to a fielded military force are less practical to communities of civilians or garrison military structures. An important ally in this threat to internal national security is the public health community and a key function of the public health community is the ongoing assessment of community health through surveillance. DOD-GEIS has assumed a pioneering role in creating new public health systems to meet this unprecedented challenge. Many of the innovations made possible by the military's unique global medical information systems are equally beneficial detecting naturally occurring and deliberate outbreaks of infectious diseases. However, it is only through partnering with civilian public health agencies that it will be possible to apply these techniques on the scale necessary to build a truly national civil biodefense infrastructure needed for early detection and effective management of these threats. In numerous readiness exercises, the need for crisp and accurate information has been seen as central to effective crisis management. Public health surveillance is thus a foundation stone in any comprehensive system for biodefense.",
