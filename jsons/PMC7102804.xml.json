This was known as the Infectious Disease Epidemic Plan (IDEP) [3], [11]. For this particular outbreak the index case was identified on June 21, 2015, and as the number of cases were increased the IDEP was activated. With the widespread of MERS in the emergency room, level three, which is the highest level for the plan, called for the closure of the hospital and evacuated wards were being reassigned to cohort confirmed, exposed and non infected/none exposed patients. This eventually led to the successful control of the outbreak, which was declared over, on October 12, 2015.",

It is noteworthy that these findings only reflect the perceptions of those who were traumatized by their experience of surviving the virus in this environment, which may or may not reflect the complexity of the situation. Nevertheless, the perceived denial and underestimation might have contributed significantly to the outbreak of MERS in the hospital. For example, at a personal level, one participant reflected on his experience, which was similar to that of other participants, saying that he thought that the MERS outbreak was under control, and it did not occur to him that he would catch the virus. He explained:\u201cThe thing that comes to mind is that life was going on as usual; you know that we had the outbreak in March, so we thought we were over it and Mafee Mushkelah [Arabic for \u2018no problem\u2019], and everything in life was going on\u2026\n",

One explanation of such a questionable infectious disease prevention response is official denial and underestimation of the outbreak. Such underestimation of the seriousness of the infection caused a delay in acknowledging the outbreak and then announcing it properly to everyone so they could exercise their highest level of vigilance. The participants\u2019 views on this matter were critical. They described how they had to work under the high risk of infection without proper warning:\u201cCreate a policy where you alert the staff as soon as you have one case or two cases in the ER; you [i.e. the decision makers] should have alerted all the staff\u201d\n",

Some participants prioritized patient care over their own health, exposing themselves to risks. Such behaviours can be better explained through the theoretical lens of altruism, which is associated in this situation with a sense of professionalism. The notion of altruism, which was first coined by Auguste Comte in the 19th century, basically refers to an unselfish act that is undertaken voluntarily and intentionally to promote the welfare of others [20], [21]. There are two types of altruism: normative and autonomous. The former refers to the usual acts of helpfulness regulated by social norms with low risk and low cost to the performer, whereas the latter refers to intentional acts that are undertaken primarily for the benefit of others and often associated with high risk and high cost [20]. Therefore, those participants who always went the extra mile for their patients believed that they caught the virus as a result of their altruism. It seems their eagerness to help their patients led them to either consciously or unconsciously practice poor self-protection and precautions. While fear of the infection, anxiety, panicky responses, and scary stories also negatively influenced the performance of some healthcare providers during the epidemic.",
