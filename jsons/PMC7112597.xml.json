Bats are found on every continent except Antarctica [15]. In Brazil, 178 bat species have been recorded [16], of which 40 are settled in Rio Grande do Sul state, the Brazilian southern region [17]. Despite this wide range of bat species and high rates of leptospirosis, there are few Brazilian studies on this subject showing low bat leptospiral infection rates [4], [18]; however, they were performed in urban areas of Southeast region. Thus, in the present study, we sought to investigate the frequency of pathogenic Leptospira strains in bats from different areas of Rio Grande do Sul, the southern Brazilian state, which has a different ecosystem.",

Considering the family, there seems to be higher frequency of positive results within Vespertilionidae family, although there was no statistical significance; thus, further studies are needed to confirm that different bat families have different degrees of susceptibility to Leptospira spp. infection. The leptospiral host specificity could not be accessed, since there was failure to amplify the secY gene fragment. This may have been occurred due to low bacterial loads or poor DNA quality, as the bats arrived in the laboratory days after death. Previous studies also report difficulty to amplify larger amplicons from kidney samples positive for leptospiral real-time PCR, even though the bat specimens were captured avoiding DNA quality issues [27], [28].",
