The non-SPF cats were originated from three non-related queens and two toms. Kittens arrived at the facility at the age of 8\u201312 weeks. They were acclimated and used in the studies at the age of 14\u201318 weeks. The animals were kept in separate groups in a closed facility. Their FCoV negative status was checked with PCR and virus neutralisation tests. The absence of feline parvovirus (FPV), feline herpesvirus (FHV), feline calicivirus (FCV), feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) and feline leukaemia virus (FELV) in the conventional cats was confirmed by PCR and/or ELISA tests. For study purposes, the same group structure was established both for SPF and conventional kittens such as two study groups (Group 1 and Group 2, each n\n = 5) and a control group (C-Group, n\n = 2) were formed. Kittens were inoculated oronasally (D0 and D14) and intramuscularly (D28 and D42) with 103 50% tissue culture infective doses (TCID50) of the recombinant viruses PFIPV-DF-2 (Group 1) and PFIPV-FD-2-R3i (Group 2), respectively. The vaccinated animals and unvaccinated controls were oronasally challenged (D56) with 103 TCID50 of the parent virus FIPV DF-2. The whole clinical observation period of time was altogether 8 months long. During this time kittens were clinically examined on a daily basis. Cats were scored for several clinical signs as described earlier (Haijema et al., 2004). Briefly, scoring was based on depression (inactivity for three consecutive days, 1 point), anorexia (not eating for three consecutive days, 1 point), and neurological disorders (swaggering, 1 point) on a daily basis, while fever (40.1 \u00b0C, 1 point), jaundice (yellow plasma, 1 point), weight loss (loss of 2.5% of body weight per week, 1 point), and lymphopenia (lymphocyte count of <0.5 \u00d7 109/l) was scored on weekly basis. Kittens showing signs of terminal FIP were euthanized in order to avoid unnecessary suffering, while healthy animals were exterminated at day 90 post-challenge (p.c.), followed by full post-mortem examination. All animal experiments were approved and supervised by the Ethical and Animal Welfare Committee of the National Food Chain Safety Office.",

This phenomenon is in accordance with previous findings that the intact ORF3abc region is indispensable for enteric replication of FCoV (Chang et al., 2010, Pedersen et al., 2012, B\u00e1lint et al., 2013). High mutation frequency and recombination are common features of coronaviruses, which can lead to increased virulence of the attenuated strains used for vaccination.

In most of the cases the challenge led to ADE and in all case to the development of severe symptoms of FIP in non-SPF animals, independently of the genetic characteristics of the applied vaccine candidates. ADE pathomechanism is not an exclusive feature of FIPV infection; it resembles to the ADE-based Dengue haemorrhagic shock syndrome, first described by Peiris and Porterfield (1979). The same phenomenon was also observed in the case of flaviviruses, alphaviruses, lentiviruses, influenzaviruses, enteroviruses and measles virus (Peiris and Porterfield, 1979, Porterfield, 1986, Takeda et al., 1988, Tamura et al., 1991, Chen et al., 2013, Iankov et al., 2013). It is suspected that ADE might be more severe by early FIPV challenge after vaccination. However, the lack of development of fatal FIP and ADE among SPF cats and the prolonged survival of two non-SPF animals after 14 days challenge suggest that other biological factors could have as strong effect on the development of FIP as early challenge.",

Applying FIPV DF-2 as a challenge strain, all the control and vaccinated animals perished within four weeks, with or without the signs of ADE (Farsang et al., unpublished result). Studies conducted by others are congruent with ours and indicate that virtually all cats develop FIP within four weeks after FIPV DF-2 challenge (reviewed in Pedersen, 2009). This is the first case when we observed long-term survival in our vaccination trials. It may be the consequence either of the slightly higher neutralising antibody titre of the two animals or it can be the result of the altered specificity of their immune response. The prolonged survival of 40% of the PBFIPV-DF-2 vaccinated cats makes PBFIPV-DF-2 a more promising candidate than PBFIPV-DF-2-R3i for further vaccine development.",
