Cancer survivors\u2019 follow-up care has been severely affected due to increased risk of infection associated with hospital attendance, limited workforce availability and other resource constraints, implementation of new protocols to screen patients impacting workflow, and concerns of patients and health care providers about risk of infection [1]. Evidence-based recommendations on how to manage cancer survivors in a pandemic are lacking and much of the general guidance (such as CDC guidelines) [2] suggests that clinic visits for cancer survivors, including routine surveillance visits to detect cancer recurrence, should be postponed [3]. Such a situation is problematic especially if the pandemic is long lasting, leaving important survivorship issues and concerns unaddressed. In the absence of appropriate guidelines, cancer survivors are at increased risk of inappropriate or inconsistent follow-up care that could have far-reaching and even life-threatening results.",

            "text": "Based on the issues and opportunities highlighted by respondents, we propose three priority areas of survivorship care that require further research and practice development efforts:Triage of immediate needs of cancer survivors: The lack of standardized methods for triaging the immediate needs (physical, psychosocial and spiritual) of cancer survivors for urgent care during COVID-19, as highlighted by respondents, has likely reflected practices that existed prior to COVID-19. Although a range of tools are available (e.g., the DT), such tools are not routinely implemented in survivorship settings. Screening for survivors\u2019 needs and the prioritization of care often requires a highly contextualized approach consistent with the local setting and resources [5]. Implementation of a standardized method to screen for, and manage, the immediate needs of cancer patients at each cancer center is likely helpful for future management of crisis and pandemic situations. The use of electronic patient reported outcomes and further developments in ecological momentary assessment technologies will likely advance this agenda [6, 7].Tele-survivorship care: In light of the increased international adoption of telehealth in the cancer and primary care communities, the development of standardized recommendations on broader use of tele-survivorship follow-up (with or without the supplement of other mobile health technologies) is a priority. Such recommendations should include guidance on identification of patients suitable for tele-survivorship follow-up; training requirements for practitioners, patients and caregivers; solutions for addressing teething issues and barriers at the clinical, organizational and system levels (including funding and reimbursement arrangements) [8]; and ethical and cultural considerations (i.e., accessibility of, and resources required for, telehealth and technological platforms, cultural appropriateness and patient preferences) arising from broader use of telehealth and technology. It is clear in the literature that addressing the above issues will accelerate the adoption of tele-survivorship care [8, 9]. Further implementation research efforts should including planning for and evaluation of reach, effectiveness, adoption and maintenance [10, 11], ensuring telehealth delivery is at least non-inferior to face-to-face delivery as well as cost effective across various settings.Alternative models of care: The limitations of survivors\u2019 ability and willingness to attend tertiary care centers during COVID-19 have created an opportunity for cancer care practitioners to de-centralize or delegate care from the specialist setting. Alternative models of post-treatment follow-up care have been proposed but with varying levels of uptake internationally [12, 13]. There is an ongoing debate about \u201cwho\u201d should deliver survivorship care, and \u201cwhich\u201d models of care are most effective in delivering quality of care. We support the view that there is no one-size-fit all model and we call for a focus on \u201cwhat\u201d constitutes quality [14], within the specific contexts of health services and resources. Again, we call for robust implementation research designs planing for and measuring the various aspects of program implementation including effectiveness of such alternative models. Specifically, practitioners working under different reimbursement models (e.g., private insurance, government) will need to have worked out new payment schemas to be able to maintain their programs. A personalized pathway approach is the next logical step. There is growing interest and ongoing efforts in developing the evidence base and practice for risk stratification and need assessments, mainly in the USA [15\u201317] and the UK [18]. We call for efforts and attention from the international survivorship community to advance the science and practice across all countries.",
