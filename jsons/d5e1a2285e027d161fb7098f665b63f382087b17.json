To trace the evolution of type I and II feline coronavirus in China, 115 samples of ascetic fluid from FIPsuspected cats and 54 fecal samples from clinically healthy cats were collected from veterinary hospitals in China. The presence of FCoV in the samples was detected by RT-PCR targeting the 6b gene. The results revealed that a total of 126 (74.6%, 126/ 169) samples were positive for FCoV: 75.7% (87/115) of the FIP-suspected samples were positive for FCoV, and 72.2% (39/54) of the clinically healthy samples were positive for FCoV. Of the 126 FCoV-positive samples, 95 partial S genes were successfully sequenced. The partial S gene-based genotyping indicated that type I FCoV and type II FCoV accounted for 95.8% (91/95) and 4.2% (4/95), respectively. The partial S genebased phylogenetic analyses showed that the 91 type I FCoV strains exhibited genetic diversity; the four type II FCoV strains exhibited a close relationship with type II FCoV strains from Taiwan. Three type I FCoV strains, HLJ/HRB/2016/10, HLJ/HRB/2016/11 and HLJ/HRB/2016/13, formed one potential new clade in the nearly complete genome-based phylogenetic trees. Further analysis revealed that FCoV infection appeared to be significantly correlated with a multi-cat environment (p < 0.01) and with age (p < 0.01). The S gene of the three type I FCoV strains identified in China, BJ/2017/27, BJ/2018/22 and XM/2018/04, exhibited a six nucleotide deletion (C 4035 AGCTC 4040 ).", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}, {"text": "Our data provide evidence that type I and type II FCoV strains co-circulate in the FIP-affected cats in China.

LI ET AL. the 95 FCoV strains identified in China, 91 strains fell into the type I FCoV group, forming 11 clusters in the partial S gene-based phylogenetic tree; four strains belonged to the type II FCoV group, exhibiting close relationships with the type II FCoV reference strains from Asian countries (Figure 2). In our study, the nearly complete genomes of four type I FCoV strains, HLJ/DQ/2016/01 (GenBank accession no. KY292377, 29,303 bp), HLJ/HRB/2016/10 (GenBank accession no. KY566209, 29,440 bp), HLJ/HRB/2016/11 (GenBank accession no. KY566210, 29,297 bp), and HLJ/HRB/2016/13 (Gen-Bank accession no. KY566211, 29,337 bp), were obtained. The genome sequences of the four strains included all ORFs of FCoV. The four strains were identified in the FIP-suspected cats. The phylogenetic analysis indicated that the HLJ/HRB/2016/10, HLJ/HRB/2016/ 11, and HLJ/HRB/2016/13 strains formed one cluster of a potentially new type I FCoV when compared with the type I and type II FCoV reference strains, and the strain HLJ/DQ/2016/01 formed another clade; the three strains HLJ/HRB/2016/10, HLJ/HRB/2016/11, and HLJ/HRB/2016/13 showed the highest phylogenetic relationship with the Cat 1 Karlslunde reference strain from Denmark (Figure 3). The genomic similarity analysis revealed that the four type I FCoV strains with the nearly complete genomes identified in our study were clearly distinct from the classical Black strain of the type I FCoV from USA at the part of the S gene (Figure 4a). Of the four identified type I FCoV strains, the genome of the HLJ/DQ/2016/01 strain exhibited the divergence when compared with the HLJ/HRB/2016/10, HLJ/ HRB/2016/11, and HLJ/HRB/2016/13 strains. This result was in line with the nearly complete genomes-based phylogenetic tree (Figure 3). The HLJ/HRB/2016/10, HLJ/HRB/2016/11 and HLJ/HRB/2016/13 strains exhibited the obvious difference at the part of the S gene, 3\u2032 end of the ORF1a gene, M gene, and ORF7b gene when compared with the Cat 1 Karlslunde strain of the type I FCoV from Denmark (Figure 4b). Moreover, analysis of the genomic comparison revealed that the three strains HLJ/HRB/2016/10, HLJ/HRB/2016/11, and HLJ/ HRB/2016/13 showed amino acids similarity of 94.7% (percentage of divergence: 5.3%) when compared with the classical Black strain of the type I FCoV; the amino acids similarity of 95.1% (percentage of divergence: 4.9%) were observed between the three strains and the Cat 1 Karlslunde reference strain of the type I FCoV. 4 | DISCUSSION In China, FIP is a serious and emerging problem in domestic cats. Little information regarding the epidemiology of FCoV is available in China. In our study, 115 samples of ascitic fluid from FIP-suspected diseased cats and 54 fecal samples from clinically healthy cats were subjected to detection and phylogenetic analysis of FCoV. A total of 126 (74.6%, 126/169) samples were positive for FCoV.

Further analysis indicated that the six-nucleotide deletion (C 4035 AGCTC 4040 ) in the three type IFCoV strains was not reported in the current GenBank database, according to the nucleotide BLAST search tool. The information from the limited samples suggested that the three FCoV strains with the six unique nucleotide deletions may be one of the characteristics of Chinese regional type I FCoV strains. The partial S gene-based phylogenetic tree revealed the genetic diversity of the type I FCoV strains identified: the type I FCoV strains collected from the same region of China showed genetic diversity from each other. In contrast, the type II FCoV strains identified in our study formed one clade in the partial S gene-based phylogenetic tree, exhibiting a close relationship with type II FCoV strains from Taiwan and Japan. In our study, analysis of the phylogenetic tree and genome similarity indicated that the three FCoV strains with the nearly complete genome (HLJ/HRB/ 2016/10, HLJ/HRB/2016/11, and HLJ/HRB/2016/13) formed a potentially new type I FCoV cluster, and differed genetically from the classical Black strain of the type I FCoV from USA and the Cat 1 Karlslunde strain of the type I FCoV from Denmark. These data suggested that the high infection rates of the type I FCoV has led to the high seroprevalence of type I FCoV in the cat population inChina. The high variability of the type I FCoV strains in our study may be attributed to long-term interactions between the type I FCoV strains and their hosts.

The FCoVs are classified into two distinct serotypes, type I FCoV and type II FCoV, according to their serological properties. In our study, the partial S genes of 95 samples were successfully sequenced, out of the 126 FCoV positive samples. Of the 126 FCoV positive samples, the partial S genes of 31 samples were not obtained due to the low viral load in samples or the potential mismatching between primers and templates. Most of the FCoV strains identified in our study belonged to type I FCoV (95.8%, 91/95) according to the phylogenetic analysis of the partial S gene; only four FCoV strains (4.2%, 4/95) were allocated to type II FCoV. In our study, the prevalence of type I FCoV in the FIP-suspected cats was higher than that of type I FCoV in Taiwan (89.0%, p > 0.05) and Korea (54.5%, p < 0.01) (An et al., 2011; Lin et al., 2009). These data suggested that type I FCoV was more prevalent in cats in China.Further studies should be conducted to understand the effect of the high prevalence of type I FCoV strains on the development of FIP in China. Co-infection with type I and II FCoVs has been reported in cats in many countries(Benetka et al., 2004;Hohdatsu, Okada, Ishizuka, Yamada, & Koyama, 1992;Kummrow et al., 2005;Lin et al., 2009).
