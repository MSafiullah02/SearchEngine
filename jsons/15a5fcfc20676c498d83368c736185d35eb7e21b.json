The massive number of cases admitted to emergency departments and the rapid evolution to respiratory failure have quickly depleted critical care resources, especially respiratory support equipment, such as ventilators, and intensive care unit (ICU) beds. In this context, any therapeutic and oxygenation support strategy that conserves medical resources should be welcomed. Prone positioning is a well-known ventilatory support strategy to improve oxygenation levels, typically applied in mechanically ventilated patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The proposed mechanism by which this strategy works involves reducing ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) mismatch and making lung perfusion more uniform [1, 2] . Here, we describe our experience with two COVID-19 patients who presented to the emergency department with respiratory failure and were admitted to the ICU. Both cases were successfully managed with self-proning and noninvasive oxygenation, without the need for intubation.",

A computed tomography scan showed pulmonary opacities, with peripheral, multifocal, ground-glass attenuation, involving 25-50% of the pulmonary parenchyma in both lungs, together with consolidation in both lower lobes (Fig. 1) . Because he had tachypnea and tachycardia, he was admitted to the ICU and started on oxygen, applied through a nonrebreather face mask at 10 L/min. Nonetheless, he continued to complain of dyspnea and was tachypneic, with a respiratory rate of 30 breaths/min, despite 100% peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO 2 ) having been achieved. He was then instructed to switch to the prone position for as long as he could. The proning time was approximately 10 hours and resulted in significant improvement of the symptoms and a progressive reduction in his need for oxygen-from 10 L/min to 5 L/min-together with improvement of his tachypnea and tachycardia.

The massive number of patients with respiratory failure admitted to the emergency wards have rapidly depleted medical resources, which are more critical in low-and middle-income countries. As an additional pressure on hospital stockpiles, concerns related to the risks involving aerosol generation that could potentially increase virus dispersion, have precluded the use of noninvasive ventilatory strategies and have promoted earlier intubation [3] .

Placing the patient in the prone position results in more uniform alveolar architecture and perfusion, thus reducing regional V/Q mismatch and improving oxygenation. The consequent improvement in oxygenation leads to further improvement of the V/Q mismatch and is associated with reduced mortality [1, 2] . In one previous study, this strategy was successfully applied in 20 awake, non-intubated patients with moderate to severe ARDS [4] . In that study, early prone positioning combined with high-flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy/noninvasive ventilation (HFNC/NIV) avoided the need for intubation in more than half of the patients, and the PaO 2 /FiO 2 increased by 25-35 mmHg in those patients [4] . To our knowledge, there have been only two case reports and one case series in which prone positioning was applied in awake, nonintubated patients with COVID-19 [5] [6] [7] , In the case series [7] , fifty such patients were evaluated and the median peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO 2 ) increased from 80% while breathing room air to 84% after application of supplemental oxygen. After 5 minutes of proning, the median SpO 2 improved significantly (to 94%). In 13 patients (26%), the SpO 2 failed to improve and endotracheal intubation was required within 24 hours after their arrival in the emergency department.",

Both reported relief from their respiratory symptoms and presented an improvement in their PaO 2 /FiO 2 that allowed the amount of oxygen supplied to be reduced. In the patient described in case 2, however, the improvement in PaO 2 seen in the blood gas analysis after prone positioning was paradoxically accompanied by a slight worsening of the arterial carbon dioxide tension (PaCO 2 ) The expected change in PaCO 2 during prone positioning may be variable. The behavior of the PaCO 2 depends mainly on that of the alveolar ventilation and its relationship with the total ventilated lung volume [1] . We believe that the improvement in the PaO 2 promoted the decrease in the respiratory rate, which was the ultimate determinant of the increase in the PaCO 2 in this case.",
