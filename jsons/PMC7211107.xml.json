Neyman and Ervin first performed a bench study demonstrating the technical feasibility of ventilating four patients with one ventilator and one modified circuit.1 The same circuit configuration was used in 2008 by Paladino et al in an animal model, resulting in substantial differences in oxygenation and decarboxylation between subjects during the ventilation period.2 In 2012 Branson et al tested in vitro the Neyman and Ervin system simulating different conditions of compliance and resistance between the simultaneously ventilated test lungs. They observed wide variability in measured tidal volume (Vt) and end-expiratory lung volume, so they concluded that the technique should be avoided because of potential danger.3 Accordingly, the authors argued that the stockpiling of ventilators should be the first-line solution when massive emergencies are forecast; only after their depletion, strategies such as the \u2018double circuit\u2019 should be implemented for the shortest possible duration.4 5\n",

Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) was set at 15 cmH2O and initial inspiratory pressure (Pinsp) at 10 cmH2O. We performed an initial 15 hour test with similar conditions between the two simulated patients (static compliance of the respiratory system (Cstat) 50 mL/cmH2O and airway resistance (Raw) 5 cmH2O/L/sec); in pressure control mode (Pinsp 11 cmH2O, PEEP 14 cmH2O, RR 20 beats/min), measured delivered Vt was 953 mL, while the patients received 470 mL each.",

However, for a clinical application of this \u2018extreme\u2019 technique, several other factors must be taken into account. Indeed, anthropometric features (body weight and body mass index), respiratory mechanics (lung and chestwall compliances, airway resistances, possible auto-PEEP), physiological variables (complete paralysis, oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production) and the clinical course of the two connected patients play a major role in determining the quality and quantity of ventilation delivered to each patient. Moreover, monitoring respiratory mechanics in each patient would be impossible or very difficult; however, we cannot neglect the possibility that, besides technical and physiological factors, ethical dilemmas may also arise.7 Indeed, the most difficult choice during such an emergency would be to either accept a grim triage reality (in which not all patients receive a ventilator) or accept the fact that trying to save two patients with one ventilator could mean harming at least one of them.",
