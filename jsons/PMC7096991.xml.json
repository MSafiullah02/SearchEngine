            "text": "The type III IFN family was discovered by two teams1,2. The groups chose different naming conventions but subsequently agreed upon the IFN-\u03bb nomenclature3. We use the current nomenclature here and include the now abandoned nomenclature in parentheses. We list protein names, but the names of their encoding genes are generally equivalent, with the exception that Greek letters are replaced by Latin letters (for example, the IFN-\u03bb1 protein is encoded by the IFNL1 gene). In humans, the type III IFN family consists of four members: IFN-\u03bb1 (IL-29), IFN-\u03bb2 (IL28A), IFN-\u03bb3 (IL-28B) and IFN-\u03bb4 (ref. 4). Mice have two functional genes encoding IFN-\u03bb (Ifnl2 and Ifnl3) and two Ifnl1 pseudogenes Ifnl1-P1 and Ifnl1-P2 (Fig. 1). The IFN-\u03bb receptor complex is composed of the specific IFN-\u03bb receptor chain 1 (IFN-\u03bbR1 (IL28RA)) and the shared IL-10 receptor chain 2 (IL-10R2 (IL-10R\u03b2)).",

            "text": "Engagement of the IFN-\u03bb receptor complex by any of the four ligands leads to activation of the receptor-associated tyrosine kinases JAK1 and TYK2, which then phosphorylate specific tyrosines in the intracellular domain of the receptor (Fig. 2). This event creates docking sites for STAT1 and STAT2 signaling molecules, which leads to their recruitment and subsequent phosphorylation1,2,5. The phosphorylated STATs recruit IFN regulatory factor 9 (IRF9), which together form IFN-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3), which enters the nucleus and drives the transcription of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). Despite using different receptors, both type I and III IFNs activate ISGF3 (ref. 6) and therefore induce highly similar transcriptional responses6,7,8,9. IFNAR2 (part of the type I IFN receptor complex (Fig. 2)) interacts directly with the IFN-induced protein Usp18, which inhibits the response to IFN-\u03b110 but not to IFN-\u03b2 or IFN-\u03bb11,12, thereby creating, at least in human cells, a negative feedback loop for IFN-\u03b1. In accordance with this, IFN-\u03b2 and IFN-\u03bb elicit prolonged responses in cell cultures, whereas the response to IFN-\u03b1 is shorter in duration13,14. However, a different study showed an inhibitory effect of Usp18 on IFN-\u03bb induction of some (but not all) ISGs tested in the mouse system15.",

Mouse liver shows no expression of IFN\u03bbR1 and no responsiveness to IFN-\u03bb in vivo22,23, but liver cells derived from mice require the IFN\u03bbR1 receptor for efficient control of viral replication24. In humans, mucosal epithelial tissues as well as the liver respond to type III IFNs25,26. Type III IFN responses in immune cells are still being investigated and are discussed below. Differential splicing of the IFNLR1 gene gives rise to three mRNAs. Variant 1 leads to the expression of the functional receptor; variant 2 lacks a part of the intracellular domain and is nonfunctional; variant 3 encodes only the extracellular part of the receptor27. The product of variant 3 is released from cells and can act as a decoy receptor and potentially downregulate type III IFN responses28, but the physiological role of splice variants 2 and 3 are not yet well established. Interestingly, epigenetic silencing seems to block the induction of IFNLR1 in nonresponsive tissues29, but more work is needed to understand the mechanisms regulating IFNLR1 induction and the physiological role of its splice variants.",

IFNL1, unlike IFNB1, possesses a cluster of distal NF-\u03baB sites that are necessary for maximal IFNL1 transcription and could stimulate IFNL1 gene induction in an IRF-independent manner45. In colon and respiratory epithelial cells, ZEB1 was identified as a selective repressor of IFNL1 transcription, suggesting a key difference between regulation of type I and III IFN expression46,47. Furthermore, induction of type III IFNs can also be initiated via the signaling adaptor MAVS when it is associated with peroxisomes48. The involvement of peroxisomes in the induction of type III IFNs is interesting, as RIG-I\u2013like receptor signaling via MAVS on peroxisomes does not drive the induction of type I IFNs but induces expression of ISGs49. In human hepatocytes infected with HCV or treated with poly(I:C), the induction of IFNL2 and IFNL3 was dependent on IRF3 and IRF7, whereas the induction of IFNL1 was also dependent on NF-\u03baB50. Finally, another group has identified Med23, a subunit of the mediator complex51, as a direct interaction partner for IRF7 (ref. 52). Med23 and IRF7 synergistically increase IFNL transcription but have no effect on IFNB1.",

            "text": "The role of type III IFN has been assessed in a number of viral infections, either through the addition of recombinant IFN-\u03bb or in IFN-\u03bbR1\u2013deficient mice. The redundant and unique roles of type I and type III IFNs have also been investigated. Not surprisingly, viral tropism is the major determinant of the relative contribution of each IFN type. Gut epithelial cells respond exclusively to type III IFN21, and the type III IFN system mediates control of epitheliotropic viruses, such as rotaviruses, in a nonredundant fashion21. Reoviruses initiate their infection in the gut epithelia but can penetrate the epithelial layer and infect cells in the lamina propria or cause a systemic infection in mice. Type III IFN restricts the initial replication in the gut epithelium and diminishes the shedding of virus through feces, but the type I IFN system is indispensable for the prevention of systemic infection53. Thus, both IFN systems are required in a nonredundant fashion for control of reovirus infection. Similarly, in norovirus infection, type I IFN restricts systemic spread of the virus, but virus control in the gastrointestinal tract is achieved only in the presence of type III IFN signaling54. Surprisingly, type III IFN can eliminate norovirus even in the absence of an adaptive immune system. The protective effect of type III IFN is counteracted by gut commensals55, which explains why wild-type mice with a functional type III IFN system are still susceptible to norovirus. Sterilizing the gut by antibiotic treatment renders mice more resistant to norovirus in a type III IFN\u2013dependent manner55. Many viruses are released and spread from epithelial surfaces; one could thus expect a role for type III IFN in viral transmission, something that should be studied more closely in the future. An early study of the IFN-\u03bbR1 knockout mouse revealed a deficiency in the Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3)- and TLR9-mediated antiviral defense during vaginal infection with herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV-2) but not during systemic viral infection56. Thus, type III IFNs have a role in the vaginal epithelia, but further studies are required in this area. An indirect anti\u2013West Nile Virus effect of type III IFN was reported, in which tight junction integrity of mouse brain microvascular endothelial cells and maintenance of the blood brain barrier required IFN-\u03bbR1, thus limiting neuroinvasion57. This effect seems to occur through a noncanonical signaling pathway that requires IFN-\u03bbR1 but not STAT1 or protein synthesis.",

This indicates a higher degree of redundancy of the two IFN systems in the respiratory tract than in the gastrointestinal tract. Infection of airway epithelial cells in vitro and subsequent measures of the IFN-induced transcriptional signature by microarray showed that the influenza-induced IFN signature was abolished only in receptor double-deficient epithelia9, thus confirming the redundancy observed in vivo.

One may speculate that the gut, with its high risk of uncontrolled inflammation owing to the vast burden of microbe-associated molecular patterns derived from commensals, is a compartment where it is desirable to keep local responses 'below the radar' of systemic immunity. In contrast, in the lungs, which are not sterile but certainly have a bacterial burden several orders of magnitude below that of the intestines, the compartmentalization of the two IFN systems is less strict. During influenza virus infection mouse airway epithelia produce higher amounts of type III IFNs than type I IFNs9,41. Therefore, as long as lung epithelial cells are the main IFN producers, the response may be dominated by type III IFNs. However, once immune cells start producing IFN, the response may shift toward being driven by type I IFN. Thus, the division of labor between type III and type I IFNs in the lung might not be as strict as in the gut but seems to follow a similar pattern.",

A consensus is emerging showing that human and mouse plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), as well as some conventional DC subsets (BDCA3+ in humans and CD8+ in mice), produce type III IFNs35,60. Similarly, only some subsets of myeloid immune cells, such as human monocyte\u2013derived macrophages61, pDCs60,61,62 and some dendritic cell subsets in humans and in mice63, respond directly to type III IFN. For natural killer (NK) cells, reports have come to opposite conclusions about the ability of type III IFNs to influence IFN-\u03b3 secretion by NK cells64,65,66. However, adoptive transfer experiments in mice using IFN-\u03bbR1\u2013deficient (Ifnlr1\u2212/\u2212) NK cells concluded that direct type III effects on NK cells are required for maximal production of IFN-\u03b3 and antitumor activity67. Given the controversial findings, there are essentially three possibilities. One is that the type III IFN effects on NK cells are detected only in combination with other stimuli. A second is that only specific NK cell maturation stages are responsive to type III IFN. Or third, the effects of type III IFN observed are indeed indirect.",

However, two different single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified as the best predictor of treatment outcome: rs8099917 (shortened hereafter to 917) best predicted the outcome in Asians and people of European descent, whereas rs12979860 (shortened hereafter to 860) was the best predictor in a US cohort of mixed ethnicity (Fig. 1). Both SNPs were originally described as IL28B-related (i.e., IFNL3-related), and they were surprisingly not in complete linkage disequilibrium (meaning that they are not inherited together), as would be expected if they represented the same underlying causative genetic defect. What was more surprising was that only one of the SNPs identified was located within the encoding regions of known type III IFNs (changing Lys70 in IFN-\u03bb3 to arginine, which had no effect on the function of IFN-\u03bb3)92. These findings led to the speculation that these SNPs represented changes in the IFNL3 promoter region and caused differences in IFN-\u03bb3 expression. However, subsequent studies came to divergent conclusions about the SNPs' influence on IFN-\u03bb3 expression, and this issue is still not fully resolved.",

            "text": "A breakthrough came with the discovery of the IFNL4 gene situated within the region determining HCV clearance. It was found that the SNP rs368234815 was superior to SNP 860 in predicting treatment outcome in individuals of African ancestry. The TT allele of rs368234815 disrupts the open reading frame of IFNL4 and is protective in terms of HCV, whereas the ancestral '\u0394G' allele encodes a functional IFN-\u03bb4 and impairs HCV clearance. This finding suggests that IFN-\u03bb4 is the causative agent of HCV clearance failure, but it does not explain why the SNP 917 is a powerful predictor of the treatment outcome in several other populations. The discovery of a second SNP acting in combination with the \u0394G SNP resolved this discrepancy. The SNP rs117648444 (shortened hereafter to 444) represents a nonsynonymous change in the coding region of IFNL4, where a proline residue is replaced by serine, resulting in two versions of IFN-\u03bb4: the fully active IFN-\u03bb4\u2013P70 and a much less active IFN-\u03bb4\u2013S70 (ref. 93). By combining the \u0394G and 444 SNPs, one can stratify patients into three groups: (i) those having no IFN-\u03bb4, (ii) those having IFN-\u03bb4\u2013P70 and (iii) those having IFN-\u03bb4\u2013S70. Compared to the single SNPs described previously, this stratification led to a significant improvement in the predictive power of genotyping and reflects the existence of a set of distinct haplotypes in humans (a haplotype is a set of tightly linked alleles that are likely to be inherited together). Before the discovery of the IFNL4 gene, elegant work identified the probable causative haplotype by massive parallel sequencing94. In people of European ancestry, this haplotype is specifically tagged by SNP 917 and encodes the IFN-\u03bb4\u2013P70 variant, whereas the 860 SNP marks several haplotypes encoding both the P70 and S70 variants of IFN-\u03bb4 but not the frameshift mutation. In both cases, the patient group having IFN-\u03bb4\u2013S70 is somewhat neglected, and the apparent discrepancy can be resolved by genotyping and stratification as described above. Notably, this has been done only for one European HCV-infected cohort so far, and its repetition in different cohorts will be important. In particular, the impact of the IFN-\u03bb4\u2013S70 variant might differ among diseases and ethnic backgrounds. In summary, the higher rate of HCV clearance in patients encoding the IFN-\u03bb4\u2013S70 variant than in patients with IFN-\u03bb4\u2013P70 strongly suggests that the activity of the IFN-\u03bb4 protein causes, by yet unknown means, poor HCV clearance.",

Furthermore, IFNL4 genotype also influences the reactivation of cytomegalovirus (CMV) in immune-suppressed patients100,101. The data are clear but paradoxical. IFN-\u03bb4 signals through the same receptor that other members of the type III IFN family do, and its effect is highly similar. Furthermore, IFN-\u03bb4 is antiviral in vitro102. Nevertheless, having a functional IFNL4 gene renders humans less capable of clearing chronic infections such as HCV and CMV. It is likely that IFN-\u03bb4 directly or indirectly influences inflammatory responses and, thereby, viral clearance. Several studies have reported increased liver inflammation and fibrosis103,104,105,106 and increased degranulation activity of lymphocytes107 in HCV patients with the protective IFNL4 genotype (the TT allele, which destroys the open reading frame of IFNL4), suggesting that IFN-\u03bb4 impairs HCV clearance but diminishes liver inflammation and fibrosis. Other studies did not find any association or had directly conflicting data but used smaller cohorts. Interestingly, a study has found that decreased liver inflammation and fibrosis was associated with having a functional IFNL4 gene in a nonalcoholic fatty liver disease cohort, indicating that the effect of IFN-\u03bb4 on inflammation could be independent of viral infection104. However, this finding needs confirmation from other studies. We are currently incapable of offering a mechanistic explanation.",

This was confirmed by a bioinformatics analysis that found clear purifying selection acting on all nonhuman IFNL4 genes108. The frameshift mutation in human IFNL4 was introduced approximately 55,000 years ago, just before the 'Out of Africa' scenario, and was positively selected almost immediately108. This observation raises several interesting questions. Why did IFNL4 suddenly become a liability? What drove (and still drives) the pseudogenization of IFNL4?

However, the successful development of several direct-acting antivirals is changing the therapeutic landscape for HCV, and IFN is likely to have a less dominant role in the future. However, several phase III trials are currently under way in which PEGylated IFN-\u03bb1 is combined with direct-acting antivirals (telaprevir, asunaprevir or daclatasvir). Type III IFN could represent a promising future antiviral treatment for some infections with epithelial tropism, as the immunopathological side effects should be minimal. Type III IFN could be useful as a therapy for respiratory infections caused by viruses such as influenza virus or coronaviruses (SARS and MERS)74,110, and for intestinal infection caused by noroviruses or rotaviruses54. Future clinical studies are needed to test the usefulness of type III IFN against these infections and explore the effects of different delivery methods.

            "text": "Type III IFN clearly has an important role in protecting the epithelial surfaces from viral infection, but a number of interesting issues remain to be addressed. Given that lung epithelia respond to both type I and type III IFN, what is the distribution of work between these IFN systems in the respiratory epithelia? Humans are frequently challenged with viruses of low or medium pathogenicity, and the particular strength of the type III IFN system might be its ability to deal with these infections without creating severe inflammation or tissue damage. But conclusions drawn from experiments with mice in a highly controlled laboratory environment run the risk of ignoring some of the complexity found in real life. Therefore, in answering future questions, researchers should consider using complex models that allow for viral and bacterial coinfection as well as recurrent infection with several different viruses. Emerging evidence suggests an interaction between type III IFN and the adaptive immune system, but how this occurs is not yet clear. One can imagine direct and indirect effects of type III IFN, through influencing the production of other cytokines, such as IL-12, or via effects on antigen-presenting cells. It will be exciting to follow the development in this area in the coming years. The role of the paradoxical IFN-\u03bb4 in the type III IFN family is currently unclear. There is strong genetic evidence that IFN-\u03bb4 inhibits clearance of chronic viral infections such as HCV and CMV, but at present there is little or no mechanistic understanding of how this occurs.",

The duplication of the mouse locus occurred independently from that of the human IFNL locus, so mouse Ifnl2 and Ifln3 cannot be considered true orthologs of human IFNL2 and IFNL3. In humans the IFNL loci are located on the long arm of chromosome 19. In humans IFNL1, IFNL2 and IFNL3 are functional genes, and IFNL4 is a pseudogene in part of the population owing to the SNP rs368234815. Additionally this locus encodes the pseudogenes INFL1P1 and IFNL4P1. SNPs associated with HCV clearance rates are indicated with either their common names or the consequence of the variation in parentheses. The genes IFNL2, IFNL3, IFNL4 and IFNL4P1 were probably generated by a duplication event, whereby the region containing IFNL3 and IFNL4 was duplicated to generate IFNL4P1 and IFNL2, or vice versa. The recombination site localizes between IFNL4 and IFNL4P1. Exons are shown in green; arrows indicate the direction of transcription. Pseudogenes are indicated by gray boxes with the symbol \u03a8 and are not drawn to scale (except for IFNL4P1). All human pseudogenes contain introns and are thus not the result of retro-transposition.",

Type III IFNs also signal via a heterodimeric receptor, but it is composed of two different chains: the IFN-\u03bbR1 high-affinity chain and IL-10R2 low-affinity chain (which is shared with other cytokines). Both high-affinity chains interact with JAK1, whereas the two low-affinity chains interact with TYK2. Signaling downstream of both receptors results in the assembly of the ISGF3 transcription factor, which coordinates the expression of genes containing an interferon response element (ISRE).",

Both types are produced by epithelia, which also express the IFN-\u03bb receptor. In cases where this response is dominated by IFN-\u03bb, the epithelial antiviral state can be established without systemic immune cell activation. (b) Immune cell activation, such as when immune cells are strongly recruited into the infected lung or when they are exposed to virus, can trigger a type I IFN\u2013driven immune response. Because type I IFN has pleiotropic immunomodulatory effects, many cell types are activated, with wide-ranging consequences. Only myeloid immune cells are shown here, but innate and adaptive lymphoid populations are activated in addition. Appropriate type I IFN\u2013driven responses will activate innate and adaptive immune functions and lead to virus elimination. The inflammatory processes involved also have pathogenic potential and can therefore lead to immune-mediated epithelial damage. iMC, inflammatory monocyte; AM, alveolar macrophage.",
