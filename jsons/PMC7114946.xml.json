Chemicals such as chlorine and 5% chloramine have traditionally been used in Norway for surface disinfection during the terminal decontamination of isolation rooms and furniture after discharge of patients with infections.1, 2, 3, 4 The same procedure has been used for ambulances and for medical and other equipment after use by infectious patients.2, 3, 4 Manual chemical disinfection is both time and labour consuming, and there may be difficulties to ensure coverage. Internal parts of medical equipment such as ventilators, continuous positive airways pressure (CPAP) and other respiratory tract equipment, infusion pumps, suction equipment, etc. may be difficult to decontaminate. Most medical equipment has an air-cooled motor that takes air from the patient's room/environment, enabling internal parts to become contaminated.",

The H2O2 adheres to particles present in the atmosphere and on surfaces, and forms a dry film on these particles. The aerosol container (Sterusil) contains hydrogen peroxide 5%, phosphoric acid <50 ppm, silver cations <50 ppm, gum arabica <1 ppm and bi-osmotic water 95%. The system consists of a programmable robot that can be pre-programmed to the required concentration of H2O2 dry aerosol depending on the exact volume of the enclosed room.

The whole disinfection process, including the number of cycles (diffusion time) and the contact time, was pre-set on the robot. One or more pre-set cycles of H2O2 gas used varying diffusion times according to the volume of the room. Each cycle was followed by an increasing contact time of 30, 60 and 120 min after one, two and three cycles, respectively. Each cycle was immediately followed by the pre-set contact time, which was then immediately followed by the next cycle, etc. The test rooms (including garages for ambulances) were closed throughout the decontamination process, and no people were present. All ventilation openings in the rooms were taped over. The concentration of H2O2 was 2\u201317.4 parts per million (ppm) in the rooms and 36\u201360 ppm in the garages during the diffusion time. The Norwegian Directory of Labour Inspection has set exposure limits of 1 ppm of H2O2 for 8 h of exposure and less than 3 ppm for 15 min four times a day. The fume does not persist because of rapid decomposition. When the disinfection procedure was complete, the room or equipment could be used immediately.",

Before decontamination, 72% of room swabs yielded MRSA; afterwards, only one of 85 samples (1.2%) yielded MRSA.

Medical equipment and devices, and an ambulance containing medical equipment were placed in test rooms and garages, respectively. Repetitive experiments were performed using B. atrophaeus (former subtilis) spores (Raven Biological, Nebraska, USA) to control the effect of decontamination. Spore strips were placed in various places in the rooms, ambulances, and inside and outside the pieces of medical equipment. Decontamination was effective in 87% of 146 tests in special test rooms, and in 100% of 48 tests in rooms in a surgical department, using three decontamination cycles. One or two cycles had no effect on any of the spore tests (18/18). The sporicidal effect on internal parts of the medical equipment was lower; approximately 62% of all 220 tests. However, when the medical device was run and ventilated during the disinfection period, all of the spore tests (57/57) from inside the devices were decontaminated. In ambulances, the penetration of H2O2 into equipment, devices and the driver's cabin was 100% effective (60/60 tests) when using three cycles of decontamination.",
