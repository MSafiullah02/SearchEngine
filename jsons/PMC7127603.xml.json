            "text": "All marine organisms have been proven to be a veritable cornucopia of unusual steroid metabolites, but some believe that marine sponges may provide the most diverse and biogenetically unprecedented array of unconventional steroids in the entire animal kingdom [1]. The steroids isolated from sponges are sometimes very complex mixtures of highly functionalized compounds, many of which have no terrestrial counterpart. Commonly encountered features in these compounds include additional oxygenation of both the nucleus and the side-chain, side-chains extensively modified by alkylation and degradation, and structural modification of the basic carbon skeleton. The occurrence of sulfate esters of polyoxygenated sterols in sponges has also been well documented [2], [3].",

It is, therefore, particularly interesting when a sponge contains unusual steroids in large quantities, as these very likely play a functional (rather than metabolic) role in maintaining the integrity of membranous structures. It has been hypothesized and, to some extent, documented that the uniqueness of sterols in cell membranes of sponges is related to the other membrane components, particularly the phospholipids. These latter compounds seem to have head groups and fatty acids very different from those of higher animals; therefore, the structural modifications exhibited by the sponge sterols may be a sort of structural adjustments for a better fit with other membrane components [7], [8], [9], [10].",

Most of the oxygenated cholesterol derivatives have been shown to exert a cytotoxic activity on human cancer cells lines in vitro. Also, enzymatic transformations leading to secosterols, i.e. ring cleavage products of cholesterol, may result in the formation of products with cell division-inhibitory properties [16]. Finally, the recent discovery of the antiviral properties of sulfated polyhydroxysterols has increased interest in these compounds [17].",

The material is organized on the basis of the level of deviation respect to a common steroid compound (e.g. cholesterol); this arrangement led to the following five classes of compounds: (1) polyoxygenated steroids, (2) steroid sulfates, (3) steroids with unconventional side-chain, (4) unconventional nuclei, and (5) miscellaneous. Of course, some compounds may belong to more than one of the above classes; so, the following criteria have been used for their classification. Section 2 includes polyoxygenated steroids with conventional side-chain and nucleus; Section 3 contains all the steroids possessing sulfate functions; Section 4 includes steroids with unconventional side-chain and conventional nucleus; and Section 5 reports all the steroids possessing a modified nucleus. Occasionally, a few marine sponges were found to contain atypical steroids, which cannot be included in the above classes; they are reported in Section 6 (miscellaneous) of the present review.",

All the isolated sterols are characterized by oxygenated functions exclusively on rings A and B, as well as at C-11. Significant variations in the sterol profile have been observed within the genus and even for specimens of the same species coming from different habitats. Sterols 32 through 34, all bearing a 24-methylene side-chain, have been isolated as their triacetates from D. herbacea\n[26]. The sterol acetates were found to possess antitumor activity against P388 cell line. A novel polyhydroxylated sterol with \u03948(14),24 unsaturations (35) has been isolated from a Dysidea species [27]. Incrustasterols A and B (36 and 37) have been isolated from a sample of D. incrustans collected in the Mediterranean sea along the coasts of Tunisia [28]. They contain the rare \u03948(9)-11-keto functionality and were shown to be cytotoxic against human non-small-cell lung, renal carcinoma, and melanoma cell lines. Because very limited amounts of the incrustasterols had been isolated from the natural source, their synthesis has been performed starting from the easy available \u03947-cholesterol [29]. A variable sterol pattern has been described for the same species, D. fragilis, coming from different geographical areas. Two highly hydroxylated sterols (38 and 39) were isolated from the Black Sea sponge D. fragilis\n[30]. Biosynthetic experiments performed on the sponge fed with [4-14C]cholesterol showed that dietary cholesterol suffers biological oxidation leading to 38. 5\u03b1-Cholesta-8(14),24-diene-3\u03b2,6\u03b1-diol (40) has been isolated from a D. fragilis collected along the South China coasts [31]. Finally, the steroid composition of D. fragilis collected in the lagoon of Venice differed remarkably from the aforementioned specimens of the same species. The lagoonal sample contained large amounts of polar steroids, comprising 13 polyhydroxysterols; eight of them (36, 88\u201390, and 174\u2013177) were novel compounds; as reported above, compound 36 was independently found as constituent of D. incrustans\n[28].

Six different methoxysteroids have been isolated and three of them (46, 166, and 167) were novel compounds [33]. Compounds 167 and 168 are described in section 5; 46 contains a double bond at position 14 and a tetrasubstituted oxirane ring located at position 8,9. The occurrence of 3\u03b2-methoxysteroids has an interesting chemotaxonomic significance. Recently, Levi suggested to assign the genera Microscleroderma and Jereicopsis to the same order (Rhizomorina), based on interpretation of their morphologic attributes [34]. In addition to M. spirophora and J. graphidiophora, only one species of this order, Aciculites pulchra, has been analyzed for steroids and resulted to elaborate usual 3\u03b2-hydroxysterols [35]. So, the ability of producing methoxysteroids seems not to be a general feature of the order, but appears limited to some species. Therefore, the presence of methoxysterols could be a useful chemical marker for an improved classification of Rhizomorina sponges.",

To have these compounds available in greater amounts for more detailed pharmacological research, the synthesis of aragusterols A, B, C, and D has been successfully performed. The synthesis involves the enantioselective formation of a side-chain segment and its stereoselective coupling with a 20-keto steroid obtained from (+)-hecogenin [83].

Each sterol contained an \u03b1,\u03b2-disubstituted furan in the side-chain, cis-fused A/B ring, a monoenolized \u03b1-diketone in the A ring, and a C-21 carboxyl group. 145 and 146 are stable to acid, but both equilibrate to a 1:1 mixture in base. Oxidation of C-21 to an alcohol is not uncommon in marine sterols, but this is the first case of sponge sterols with a C-21 carboxylic acid. The occurrence of a furan in the side-chain of a sterol is also unprecedented; the heterocyclic was supposed to be biogenetically derivable from oxidation of C-23 and C-29 to carbonyl groups followed by condensation. Kiheisterones A and B exhibit mild cytotoxicity against several human tumor cell lines (A-549 lung carcinoma and HT-29 colon adenocarcinoma) and against the P-388 murine lymphocytic leukemia cell line. Both compounds are more cytotoxic against nontumorous monkey kidney cells.",

A dimeric steroid, bistheonellasterone (151), considered to be biosynthesized through a Diels-Alder cycloaddition of theonellasterone (149) and its \u03944-isomer, has also been found in the same sponge [94]. It is noteworthy that theonellasterone and conicasterone were seen under an optical microscope as crystals deposited in the tissue of fresh marine sponge. The analysis of a T. swinhoei specimen, collected off the Hachijo-jima island, afforded conicasterol and a new dimeric steroid, bisconicasterone (152). Its structure was established as a Diels-Alder-type dimer of conicasterone [95]. It is noteworthy that no trace of theonellasterol, previously reported as the major component of the same species collected at Okinawa, has been found in this sample of T. swinhoei, which suggests a site-depending biochemistry of this species. A further investigation of the Hachijo specimen yielded seven oxygenated conicasterol derivatives (153\u2013159) along with (24R)-7\u03b2,8\u03b2-epoxy-24-methyl-4-methylene-14\u03b1-methoxy-cholestan-3\u03b2-ol (160) and (234R)-3\u03b2-hydroxy-24-methyl-4-methylene-8,14-secocholestane-8,14-dione (161) [96].
