If the public trusts the government is dealing with a crisis effectively, there will be less public fear. Still, ideal sense of partnership and trust between authorities and the public is far from present, as repeated surveys have shown. A well-planned communication effort should provide clear precautions, reassure the public, reduce unnecessary distress, and limit inappropriate demands on health-care system [1] [2] [3] . Different views exist regarding disclosing to the public preparedness plans for various scenarios of bioterrorism and as to the extent in which the public should be involved. The older paradigm claims that people should know only what the communicators want them to know, in order to get them to behave \"rationally\" during a crisis -i.e., the way the communicator wants them to behave [2] . This model is criticized by risk communication experts to be \"overtly manipulative\" and unlikely to succeed. Risk communication is more likely to succeed if it sets the more realistic goal of helping people understand the facts, in ways that are relevant to their own lives, feelings, and values, so they are empowered to put the risk in perspective and make more informed choices [4] . More updated models shift towards giving the public a sense of partnership in the emergency, mechanisms, leads to more enduring attitude and behavioral change [13] . Under circumstances of an attack, its mere threat may produce less motivation, and together with high levels of illiteracy in the American public, may be the cause of diminished ability to process complicated messages, thus leading to \"peripheral route\" message processing.",

Over 250 studies show that health-related print materials are far exceeding the reading ability of the average adult and so health communication efforts must be tailored to the literacy skills of the intended audience. 3. The importance of pre-and post-evaluation -developers of the anthrax postcard did not have as much time to seek expert advice and field-test their mailing, and hence some of the information presented was not properly understood. Generic and disease-specific communication materials should therefore be prepared and field-tested before an event occurs. 4. During crisis events, the unexpected takes center stage and recommended steps for developing communication efforts may not be followed rigorously. However, when communication planners abandon rigor in the name of expediency, effectiveness may suffer. To avoid the need for such a choice, the public health establishment should identify critical structures and processes that it could employ to improve communications in times of crisis.",

First exercise of its kind, Dark Winter was constructed to examine the challenges that seniorlevel policy makers would face if confronted with a bioterrorist attack that initiated outbreaks of highly contagious disease. The exercise was intended to increase awareness to the threat posed by biological weapons and to bring about actions that would improve prevention and response strategies. One of the conclusions from the simulation was that individual actions of US citizens are critical to ending the spread of contagious disease and therefore leaders must gain the trust and sustained cooperation of the American people. This conclusion, unfortunately, have been challenged unsuccessfully in the response to the 2001 anthrax attacks, when public officials failed to gain sufficient public trust and form a consistent and accurate risk communication to the public [20] .",

In November 2000, German agriculture minister Funke declared confidently that Germany was immune from BSE. Funke essentially said to the German public, \"Trust us. You're safe\". One week later the first sick cow was found. Not only did this create fear of the disease, but Funke's statements damaged public trust in government, and beef sales plummeted nationwide [2] . Consider the German government's response included the resignation of Funke, and his replacement with a green party member who promised to make the Ministry of Agriculture more aware of consumers' concerns. These symbolic actions were not intended to deal with the physical risk. Rather, they recognized the peril from fear and the reality that public perceptions of mad cow disease were a very real part of the problem. This was an example of effective risk communication, with actions as well as words. Trust was restored, and despite subsequent identification of more sick cattle, within a few months beef sales had returned nearly to normal.",

Within days, the government had to admit that it was wrong and that the first animal had indeed been used to produce protein for cattle feed. The press revealed that the Japanese government had suppressed a European Union document that reported that Japan was at high risk for BSE, and also had failed to impose controls on the cattle and dairy industry to keep the disease from spreading. Takebe made his third mistake by trying to reassure the public by sacking an assistant and publicly eating beef to show that it was safe. Takebe did not resign.

Through early and frequent media briefings, a leader can demonstrate a commitment to keeping the public up-to-date. This practice can also help avert an official information void that may be filled by harmful speculation or less dependable sources [29] . Steps toward effective interactions with the media include setting aside any predisposition to see the press as intruders or provocateurs, establishing positive working relationships with them prior to a crisis, developing a pragmatic communications strategy to deal with the reality of 24/7/60/60 reporting, and picking and training appropriate spokespersons. Incorporating the press in training exercises improves understanding between officials and the media of their roles and challenges in a bioterrorism response. When an event occurs, leaders often believe that they are too busy managing the response to spend time with the press and, by extension, the public.
