Prompt quarantining of the infected from the rest, coupled with contact tracing, has been an effective measure to encounter outbreaks. However, urban life and international travel make containment difficult. Furthermore, the length of incubation periods of some contagious diseases like SARS enable infected passengers to elude health screenings before first symptoms appear and thus to carry the disease further. Detecting and visualizing contact-tracing networks, and immediately identifying the routes of infection, are thus important. We apply information visualization and hidden cluster detection for finding cliques of potentially infected people during incubation. Preemptive control and early quarantine are hence possible by our method. Our prototype Infectious Disease Detection and Quarantine Management System (IDDQMS), which can identify and trace clusters of infection by mining patients' history, is introduced in this paper.",

            "text": "Infectious disease prevention and control is one of the most important research areas in the 21st century. The SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) outbreak in 2003 and recent world-wide avian flu infections have contributed to the urgent need to search for efficient methods for prevention and control of highly infectious diseases. During the SARS outbreak of 2003, there were 8096 probable cases and 774 deaths reported in 29 countries including China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Canada, Singapore, and Vietnam [1] . According to a WHO (World Health Organization) report [2] , three influenza pandemics were recorded in history: \"Spanish influenza\" in 1918, \"Asian influenza\" in 1957, and \"Hong Kong influenza\" in 1968. The 1918 Spanish influenza pandemic killed an estimated 40 to 50 million people worldwide. When a patient is diagnosed with a highly infectious disease or is suspected of being infected, it is crucial to locate the source of infection (also known as ground zero or super spreader) and to identify future probable cases within a short time. Such measures aim to limit the secondary spread during the outbreak. Although numerous researches have been undertaken to find effective vaccines and cure, relatively less attention was devoted to devising software programs which are capable of assisting medical planners with rapid decision making in tracing the source of an outbreak based on information obtained from patients. In addition, currently available healthcare information systems from hospitals are not designed to deal with the complex and delicate task of managing quarantine for potentially large numbers of suspected cases.",

Our developed system also allows categorizing individuals who are likely to be infected into different risk groups whereby members from the high risk group are subjected to immediate isolation whereas members from the low risk group are monitored periodically. The system also includes visualization capabilities for medical experts to analyze the outbreak as the clusters of infection depicted as interconnected graphs, and graphs for different risk groups. The system is also designed to provide medical planners with quarantine management capabilities such as administering the data of (1) persons currently being quarantined, (2) persons being monitored for symptoms but not in quarantine, and (3) persons who were recently identified for possible infection but have yet to be contacted. This paper is structured as follows. We briefly review related work in section 2. An introduction of IDDQMS is given in section 3. The extraction of detailed epidemiological history and data analysis is described in section 4. The identification of index case and tracing the source of outbreak is described in section 5. Identifying clusters of infections is detailed in section 6. The need for a quarantine management system is discussed in section 7. We summarize our ideas in section 8.",

When a patient is diagnosed with a highly infectious disease such as SARS, emergency medical planners may need to decide whom they should quarantine after analyzing the patient's history spanning the entire incubation period (e.g. approximately 10 days for the case of SARS). The information extraction phase can be carried out by a medical practitioner to record patient's name, identification number (or Passport number), address, family members, colleagues or classmates, friends, workplace address, and activities happened during the last 10 days. The extracted information is then structured into a set of events which include four primary attributes: (1) duration, (2) persons contacted during that period, (3) location visited (e.g. enclosed spaces such as offices, air planes, etc.), and (4) food taken. A snapshot of information extraction menus designed for the SARS infectious disease for entering visiting activities is depicted in Figure 2 . A separate menu is also designed to view all the visiting activities of the persons in the infectious disease as depicted in Figure 3 . As a note, the data in Figures 2 and 3 are simulated data which are used for demonstration only. In a similar way, information on persons contacted and food intake are recorded in the other information extraction menus in our system. Since the proposed system is intended for emergency medical planners, we assume that the confidentiality of the extracted information is guaranteed in a way similar to other health care information systems. Based on the extracted information, past activities of the patients are constructed as networks of events carrying respective time-stamps (see Figure 4 ). These networks are then used for visualization of the patients' past activities as well as for mining clusters of infection and identifying index cases.",

Patient 1 and patient 2 from Figure  5 are suspected of having the disease and they both have traveled on the same train (number 15) on 2 April 2006. In that case, one of them may have been carrying the disease at that time or they may have contracted the disease from a third person. Medical experts may then further examine whether patient 1 or patient 2 have contracted the disease from other sources (e.g. contaminated food) or if there was indeed a third person who may have infected them and traveled on the same train.

A screen shot captured from the data analysis module of IDDQMS is depicted in Figure 6 . In this module, patients' activities are visualized as segmented horizontal bars arranged along a time axis, and overlapping activities are grouped using separate colors. The scale of the horizontal bars is adjusted based on the longest duration from the recorded past activities of the patients being monitored. For the sake of simplicity, locations which appear in more than one patient's past activities are extracted and grouped for visual identification.

In the event of a major outbreak, the total number of patients who should be quarantined, monitored, or tracked may vastly increase as the disease may spread to densely populated urban areas. Therefore, managing and analyzing infection networks from all these cases and extraction of event data can easily overwhelm an existing information system. In this research, we develop an integrated system which not only includes data mining functionalities as described in the previous section but also contains tailor-made programs for managing patient records and their quarantine status. By using our integrated system, medical workers may decide appropriate quarantine actions such as admitting to intensive care units, isolating in purpose-built medical wards, and monitoring probable cases. These decision making procedures are depicted in Figure  8 . When a person is reported to have made contact with an infectious disease (through one of the possible mediums such as another person carrying the disease, a common location or contact with an object), he/she will need to be classified as either a confirmed case or a suspected case by observing his/her symptoms and recent medical records. Any suspected case has to be further classified either for quarantine or for monitoring procedure. This situation is depicted in the top part of Figure 8 . The quarantine management decision making process described in Figure 8 is applied to every patient who is suspected of being exposed to the disease.",

According to the World Health Organization, there are 70 cases of tuberculosis for every 100,000 citizens in Macau compared to 50 in Europe and 39 in the Americas [17] . Since the former Portuguese enclave hosts millions of visitors annually, the task of identifying the source of any potential outbreak is even more challenging. Detecting tuberculosis clusters is far more complicated since the incubation period from exposure to developing a positive skin test is approximately 2 to 12 weeks, which is much longer than in the case of SARS.
