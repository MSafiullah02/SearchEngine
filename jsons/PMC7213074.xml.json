We used all available costing data for each drug API found on Panjiva, excluding shipments <1kg in size, alongside the lowest and highest 15% of results based on prices per kg. A 5% API loss during tableting process was factored into our calculations, and a conversion cost of \nUS $0.01 per tablet was used. A multiplier based on API mass was applied to account for the price of excipients, which are additional substances needed to convert API into FPP. Our estimated API costs presume that production is carried out by a generic provider of APIs, where associated costs of capital investment, overhead and labour are not as high as for production by originator companies.",

All the treatments being evaluated in clinical trials are very cheap to manufacture. Clearly, the mass production of these drugs will need to be economically sustainable. Treatments for HIV, TB and malaria are distributed worldwide by GFATM and PEPFAR, to treat millions of people at prices close the cost of manufacture. The prices paid allow generic companies to make acceptable profits. We should adopt a similar model of drug distribution for COVID-19.2.There should be parallel manufacture by at least three different companies for each product, sourcing their API from different countries. In the early stages of the SARS-CoV2 epidemic, API production in China was severely disrupted because of quarantine of key workers and delays in transporting key raw materials between factories [61]. India has suspended export of several key drugs because of anticipated local shortages. Production of drugs in a range of countries will protect us from disruption or shortages in individual \ncountries.3.There should be no intellectual property barriers preventing mass production of these treatments worldwide. We need open \u2018technology transfer\u2019 so that the methods used to manufacture the key drugs can be shared with any country deciding to produce the drugs locally.4.Results and databases from all COVID-19 clinical trials should be fully accessible so others can learn from them. To speed up access to these drugs, countries could rely on recognition of the review and approval of key treatments by regulatory authorities in the US or Europe, or other stringent regulatory authorities. There may not be time for the normal times of regulatory review by all individual countries.",
