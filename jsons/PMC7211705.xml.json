            "text": "Suicide is often broadly defined as intentional self-harm intended to and resulting in death. The United States (U.S.) alone has observed consistent annual increases in suicide rates, with the current rate being the highest it has been in 50 years (Drapeau & McIntosh, 2020). Further, the rate of suicide attempts has increased by 250% in global conflict zones over the past 18 years (Shoib & Kim, 2019). However, there are clear issues with this broad definition due to suicide attempts (SAs) during which the individual's life does not end, which may be due to nonlethal means or rapid medical intervention. Intentionality is a key philosophical and psychological component but cannot always be determined by outside investigators or even consciously by the suicidal individual (M\u00fcnster & Broz, 2016). Impulsivity is also a heterogeneous concept that harbors inaccurate implications as it relates to suicide (Cole et al. 2019). Suicidal thoughts and behaviors (STBs) come in many forms, including not only SAs but nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) and other risk-taking behaviors such as drug and alcohol use (Ammerman et al. 2016), reckless driving (Start et al. 2018), and hostile behavior (McKinney et al. 2017). These behaviors are provoked by psychosocial stressors and associated with suicide deaths (Athey et al., 2018).",

Interestingly, the effects of sunshine are thought to implicate the serotonergic system, though one study found that the relationship between suicide and sunshine became non-significant when controlling for season. This relationship became significant among individuals undergoing selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor treatment (Makris et al., 2016). College students experience more suicidal ideation in the summer and attempts in late spring and early summer. Perceived belongingness was a factor that seemed to contribute to this seasonal association (Van Orden et al., 2008). In terms of fatal injuries, approximately one-third of motor vehicle-related deaths in Iran occur in the summer months (Khorshidi et al., 2016). Traffic-related traumatic brain injuries in the Slovak Republic have also been noted to be highest in the summer months (Taylor et al., 2020). The U.S. follows this trend, such that motor vehicle accidents peak in the summer rather than the winter (Rau et al., 2018). In fact, one study found that warm temperatures that extend beyond the norm are associated with increased injury fatalities (Parks et al., 2020), such that summer appears to be a consistently risky time of year for both suicide deaths and injury fatalities.",

            "text": "Noteworthy are the complex, bidirectional associations between biological and psychological components on suicide risk. Changes in these risk factors both impact and are impacted by the external environment, which is often comprised of recursive events that have variable impacts across individuals. In fact, one study found that those who experience the death of loved ones by suicide experience long-term emotional turmoil, presenting as its own risk factor for their own suicides (Pompili et al., 2013). This is important because it is estimated that 135 people are exposed to each suicide death, resulting in roughly 6.9 million exposed survivors each year (Cerel et al., 2018). From a neurobiological perspective, serotonergic system alterations is one of the most common findings in suicide research, including expression of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) receptor subtypes, downregulation of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and epigenetic alterations such as histone and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) methylation modifications (Gould et al., 2017). These findings suggest that depressed individuals, suicide attempters, and those who die by suicide may exhibit distinct biomarkers. These serotonergic disturbances are thought to be met with compensatory mechanisms involving thyroid and hormones and prolactin (Pompili et al., 2012). For example, free triiodothyronine (FT3) tests, which assess thyroid function, have been found to distinguish between suicide attempters and non-attempters, such that attempters are 2.27 times less likely to have higher FT3 values than non-attempters (Pompili et al., 2012). Further, sex, suicidal status, and their interaction were found to have statistically significant effects on prolactin levels independent of FT3 values, suggesting that biological mechanisms extend beyond 5-HT and BDNF. Thus, vast extant literature suggests that a complex interplay of recursive biological mechanisms may indicate suicide risk and eventually predict this behavior in those at risk.",

Further, a study of veterans found that approximately one-third of suicide attempters had no mental health diagnoses (Ursano et al. 2018). Approximately 50% of older individuals who die by suicide are believed to have had physical health problems that precipitated the act, resulting in controversy in cause of death if suicide is unclear or ambiguous (Choi et al. 2019). Overdoses may be included in poisonings and the other causes of death are also known to be ranked in the top five of suicide methods. However, the most common cause of reported suicide deaths is firearms, which is arguably easier to determine intention \u2013 or the individual who used the firearm \u2013 for both law enforcement investigators and medical examiners.",

Furthermore, it is a warranted speculation that suicide rates are likely higher than those reported due to a multitude of factors. This article focuses specifically on suicide fatalities as they relate to unintentional and undetermined injury fatalities deemed nonsuicidal in an effort to determine whether or not these rates are rising consistently with those attributed to suicide. It is hypothesized that, if associations between suicide and undetermined injury fatalities exist and suicides are being reported appropriately, these rates will also be associated.

However, crude rates of injury fatalities from 2012-2016 by age group are illustrated in Figure 1\n.

However, according to the AAS (2018; 2020), both 2017 and 2018 have already exceeded these estimates by 1,120.5 and 1,201, respectively. Increases in suicide deaths in recent years have more than doubled the average increase observed from 2012-2016.

However, these rates are crude estimates and likely to continue rising in the context of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), increased anxiety and mood disturbances, and greater difficulty in receiving care in the midst of a different, infectious disease pandemic (Reger, Stanley, & Joiner, 2020). While suicide has remained the tenth-leading cause of death in the U.S., it may very well increase in the ranks along with COVID-19, rising above deaths due to kidney disease and other causes of death (Drapeau & McIntosh, 2020).",

Secondly, the database utilized inadequately integrated Latinx groups, significantly limiting the study's ability to report on this marginalized group. Third, educational attainment is a component excluded from the dataset that would further inform interpretation. Fourth, the causes of nonsuicidal unintentional fatalities are highly variable across age groups with some of these causes having no overlap across age groups. This prevented a deeper analysis of causes that may be reported higher as a whole. Further, it is not possible to determine the specific factors noted that are impacting these findings due to the complex nature of death reporting by individual states and the general multitude of possibilities.",
