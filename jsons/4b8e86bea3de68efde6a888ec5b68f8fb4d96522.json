LNA is a high affinity nucleotide analog, nuclease resistant and elicits minimal toxicity. We show that inclusion of LNA bases in antisense ONs augments the interference of HIV-1 genome dimerization. We also demonstrate the concomitant RNase H activation by six consecutive DNA bases in an LNA/DNA mix-mer. We show ON uptake via receptor-mediated transfection of a human T-cell line in which the mix-mers subsequently inhibit replication of a clinical HIV-1 isolate. Thus, the technique of LNA/DNA mix-mer antisense ONs targeting the conserved HIV-1 DIS region may provide a strategy to prevent HIV-1 assembly in the clinic.",

One antisense ON (Vitravene, Isis Pharmaceuticals, Carlsbad) has been approved for the clinic to inhibit cytomegalovirus. The antisense ON recognizes its target by Watson-Crick base-pairing. The inhibitory functions of antisense ONs are believed to be degradation of the target RNA by RNase H, steric hindrance of the translation machinery or prevention of other protein interactions with the target RNA. RNase H is a cellular enzyme that cleaves the RNA strand in a DNA/RNA hybrid [2, 3] .",

Other desired properties are high affinity for the target, RNase H activation, and low toxicity along with good solubility and uptake. A promising and recent technology is the development of locked nucleic acid (LNA, Fig. 1A ) [4, 5] . LNA shows minimal toxicity, en-hanced binding to its target sequence and is stable to nuclease degradation [6, 7] . LNA alone cannot activate RNase H, but in a mix-mer combination with DNA increased RNase H activation can be achieved [7] [8] [9] [10] . LNA mix-mers have very high potency compared to other antisense chemistries and their downregulating capacity also close in on that of siRNA [11] .",

            "text": "We have applied a LNA/DNA mix-mer technology on a wellconserved target in HIV-1, the dimerization initiation site (DIS) [12, 13] . The HIV genome is a homo-dimer of two sense RNA single strands. The DIS is a stem loop structure with six self-complementary nucleotides at the top (Fig. 1B, bold) . There are two major motifs in HIV-1; GUGCAC in subtypes A and C, and GCGCGC in subtypes B and D [14, 15] (see also current alignments www.hiv.lanl.gov base 881-887). The loop is located between the primer binding site and the splice donor site at the end of the long terminal repeat (LTR) [16] and is involved in the dimerization of the HIV-1 genome, packaging and proviral synthesis [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] . The HIV-1 subtype A motif is a good antisense target in in vitro cell free system where the HIV-1 genome dimerization is inhibited by DIS targeting ONs. It has been shown that a 9-mer RNA ON is a good inhibitor, whereas the corresponding DNA ON does not affect the dimerization [22, 23] . These studies also indicate that sense ONs work as competitive inhibitors to this self-complimentary target. Here, we aim at increasing the potency of the DIS-targeting ONs by exchanging DNA nucleotides for high affinity, nuclease resistance LNA in the DNA sequence creating LNA/DNA mix-mers.",

When exchanging three flanking DNA nucleotides (one 5 0 and two 3 0 ) bases for LNA (asDIS 3), the same potent inhibitory effect as with the RNA was seen. These results showed that it was indeed possible to confer DNA ON with better DIS targeting properties by including the enhanced binding capacity of LNA. Further increase in the LNA content (asDIS 4 and asDIS 5) also showed improved dimerization inhibitory effects compared to DNA alone. Interestingly, but not surprisingly, the sense LNA/DNA mix-mer (sDIS 6) also had a good inhibitory effect. DIS is self-complementary and the dimeriza- tion interaction occurs between two RNA sense strands. Hence, the sense ON can bind DIS and there are indications that sense ONs work as competitive inhibitors to the dimerization process [22, 23] .",

The sense version sDIS 11 was also a good inhibitor of virus replication without activating RNase H. This is in accordance with the discussion concerning the sense 9-mer sDIS6. HIV genome has two RNA sense strands coming together in the dimerization process. The 18-mer sense ON sDIS 11 can pair to DIS and likely function as a competitive inhibitor to the dimerization process. The sense ON sDIS 10 also showed a slight downregulation of HIV-1 replication. Even though asDIS 9 inhibited in vitro dimerization and activated RNase H, it was not an efficient ON in inhibiting HIV-1 replication. This indicates that target site availability also may be different in vitro and in vivo for the different ONs. Seemingly, inhibition of dimerization is necessary for HIV-1 downregulation of virus replication when targeting DIS, while RNase H activation is not. Hence, interruption of the natural HIV-1 genome processing is more important than targeting the genome for RNase H degradation when targeting DIS. RNase H also induced some non-specific target cleavage for some of the 18-mers, which also might contribute to reduce specificity. Additionally, we believe that the seen inhibition of virus replication is due to antisense effects and exclude side-effects like cytotoxicity. Neither the ''no ON'' nor the mismatch control (asDIS 7 mm) inhibited virus replication, which indicates that there are no side-effects due to the presence of control ON per se that cause inhibition of virus replication. The ONs have also been checked for immunostimulatory CpG motifs, which could interfere and there are none.",
