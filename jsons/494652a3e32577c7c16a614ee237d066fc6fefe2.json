In order to increase the number of available organs, and, in turn, save more lives of those on the transplant wait list, the donor pool must continue to expand [ 3 ] . Donors refl ect the diverse US population; there are an increasing number of donors born in, who have resided in, or who have traveled to underdeveloped areas of the world or areas with geographically restricted infections [ 4 ] . As such, these donors are exposed to pathogens that can potentially be transmitted to recipients of the donor's organs. Additionally, there are newer techniques to identify many pathogens that may be transmitted from the donor to the transplant recipients [ 5 , 6 ] . Finally, high-profi le reports of several donor-derived infections have heightened awareness of donor-derived infections and have likely contributed to increased recognition [ 7 -19 ] . In this chapter, the incidence, methods of identifi cation and prevention, and management of unexpected donor-derived infections will be reviewed. Often, donors are expected to transmit infection (i.e., CMV donor seropositive, recipient seronegative) because of information known by the transplant team posttransplant. In most cases, such information will lead to interventions to reduce the incidence and severity of transmitted disease and is reviewed elsewhere in this text.",

These donors have been defi ned by the OPTN and US Public Health Services (PHS) as donors at increased risk of disease transmission, termed increased risk donors. The PHS updated their guidance related to increased risk donors in 2013, and this guidance has been adopted as the standard for most transplant systems globally [ 20 ] . This updated guideline refi ned prior guidance taking into account current knowledge of the epidemiology of HIV, HBV, and HCV in the community and the limitations of our contemporary screening practices ( aatb.org/DRAI-Documents ). Although living and deceased donors are considered to be equal risk in the guidelines, living donors are able to provide their own history, while histories from deceased donors are obtained from friends and relatives. These individuals may not know the fi ne details of the donor's social situation (e.g., the mother of a college student who does not live at home). As such, the guideline recognizes these limitations and places donors with incomplete donor histories in the increased risk category as risks may be present but unrecognized. (b) The 2013 guidelines newly recommend that all donors be screened with serology and nucleic acid testing (NAT) for hepatitis C, regardless of risk factors, and that all increased risk donors be screened with HIV NAT in addition to routine serology. At the present time, only serology is mandated for hepatitis B screening, although this serologic assessment includes hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) which allows for direct detection of the virus. The addition of NAT screening to serology will allow increased detection of acute infections as NAT decreases the length of time between initial infection and the ability of the test to detect the infection, referred to as the window period (Figure 8-1 ). (c) The guideline also recognizes that living donors may continue to engage in behaviors that place them at increased risk of disease transmission between screening and donation. As such, the guidelines recommend that living donors are screened as close to the donation procedure as possible, not to exceed 28 days. The feasibility of this recommendation has been demonstrated clinically [ 21 ] . 2. Consenting: Any patient who is to receive an organ from a patient with risk factors should understand the risk and agree to receive the organ based on that risk assessment. A specialized informed consent for increased risk donor organ use is mandated by policy.",

However, data as of 2011 show that posttransplant testing is not reliably performed [ 22 ] . Using assays that directly detect the virus in the posttransplant period is critical, and serology may not be reliable because recipients frequently fail to seroconvert due to transmitted infections.

Prior to the establishment of the OPTN/United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) Ad Hoc Disease Transmission Advisory Committee (DTAC) in 2005, there were no systems in place to prospectively collect data to estimate the incidence of donor-derived infections; data was only available from published case reports. Underreporting to DTAC was common initially, but recent data show a substantial increase in the numbers of reports (Table 8 -4 and Figure 8 -2 ) [ 24 , 25 ] . In the era of current screening, the following unexpected transmissions have been reported: numerous bacterial species (including grampositive cocci and gram-negative rods), Ehrlichia chaffeensis , legionella, syphilis, M. tuberculosis, Candida spp., [ 7 -9 , 11 -13 , 15 -19 , 23 -38 ] . From the available data from the US and French systems, donor-derived disease is transmitted in less than 1% of transplants, with approximately 0.03% of recipients dying from the transmitted disease [ 24 , 25 ] . There are several key points that can be learned from the data collected to date. While confi rmed bacterial transmissions are not the most commonly reported transmission, they likely represent the most common form of disease transmission. Most of the confi rmed cases of bacteria transmissions involve highly resistant gram-positive and gram-negative infections. From a series of historical studies, 5-9% of abdominal organs and up to 63% of thoracic organs appear to be contaminated with bacterial pathogens at the time of procurement [ 25 , 39 -42 ] . Use of perioperative antibiotics reduces the risk of disease transmission, although under-recognition and underreporting of bacterial transmissions are likely. Given the high rate of contamination and the increasing prevalence of highly resistant bacteria in hospitals globally, bacterial transmissions will increase over time [ 25 , 39 -42 ] . As such, diligence is important among transplant teams.",

Despite best efforts to screen for potential infections and in a timely manner, the transplanting physicians and organ recipients must understand there always remains a risk for infectious transmission. The goals of screening donors and recipients prior to transplant are to identify conditions that disqualify the donor or recipient from the transplant, to identify and treat active infections pre-transplant, and to allow for risk mitigation strategies to minimize posttransplant infections. Screening occurs in many forms including acquisition of a careful history, detailed physical examination, detection of latent or unknown active infections by laboratory testing, examination Residual risk is the rate of undetected infection depending on risk factor and testing strategy. and pathologic evaluation of the organ at the time of procurement and implantation, and posttransplant monitoring of recipients. There are policies that have been developed by the OPTN that mandate which screening tests must be done in all donors and recipients (see Tables 8-5 The indirect ELISA is used to detect antibodies (i.e., HBcAb) while the sandwich ELISA is used to detect antigens (i.e., HBsAg). In the indirect ELISA ( http://www.paho. org/hq/index.php?option=com_topics&view=article&id=10 &Itemid=40743 ), a known antigen is fi xed to the bottom of a plastic surface, usually a multi-well plate. Serum is then added and if antibodies that react to the antigen are present, they bind to the antigen. The plates are then washed and a detection antibody (usually an anti-IgG or anti-IgM antibody) that is conjugated to a substrate-specifi c enzyme is applied to each well. After washing, a substrate is then applied and is converted by the enzyme conjugated to the detector antibody, typically resulting in a colorimetric change. The intensity of this change provides a semiquantitative measurement of the presence of the antigen-specifi c antibody. To detect an antigen, a sandwich ELISA is used in which a capture antibody (one which is specifi c for the antigen of interest) is bound to the plates. The patient's serum is applied and if antigen is present, it is bound by the capture assay. The plates are then washed and antigen-specifi c antibodies are applied-creating an antibody-antigen-antibody sandwich. Detection antibodies and substrate are added as above and the resultant colorimetric change is read. Both of these methods have relatively rapid turnaround times, are not subject to a signifi cant risk of contamination, and can usually be done by either an automatic machine or with minimal technical skills.",

            "text": "As discussed below, there are clear challenges to these serological assays. To detect infection earlier, before antibodies have been created, NAT is used for screening of certain infections. NAT refers to a wide range of polymerase change reaction (PCR), transcription amplifi cation testing (TMA), and branched DNA tests. PCR is the most widely used test in which primers that code for complimentary regions of a pathogen-specifi c gene of interest are selected. For RNA viruses, the RNA is fi rst reverse transcribed to create a complementary DNA (cDNA) based on the RNA template. At this point, PCR for both RNA and DNA viruses are the same. The source nucleic acids are then mixed with the selected primers, DNA polymerase, deoxynucleoside triphosphates, and buffer materials. An initialization step activates the polymerase, and then a denaturation step melts the DNA into two single strands so that the primers may anneal. Extension or elongation then occurs and repeated cycles proceed to amplify the presence of the gene of interest. The presence of DNA can be detected in one of several ways. In real-time PCR, fl uorescent dyes are used to intercalate into the double-stranded DNA to quantitatively detect the target DNA. NAT is challenged by longer turnaround time than serologic tests, greater technical expertise to perform the test, and risk of contamination that may result in false-positive test results, especially in lowvolume laboratories.",

            "text": "Once an individual is infected with a viral infection, there is typically local replication of the virus with subsequent viremia (see Figure 8 -1 ) [ 58 ] . The period of time between initial infection and detectable viremia is referred to as the eclipse period. Once viremia is present, the immune system can recognize the virus and produce neutralizing antibodies to components of the virus [ 58 ] . The period between initial infection and the fi rst detection of these antibodies is referred to as the window period [ 59 ] . Transmission of both HIV and HCV from donor to recipient has been reported to UNOS during both the eclipse and serologic window periods [ 17 , 23 , 24 ] . The window period differs for each virus and has been shortened over time with improved serologic tests that are able to detect antibodies earlier after initial infection (Table 8 -7 ) [ 60 , 61 ] . Unfortunately, even once antibodies are formed, it may be challenging to detect these antibodies. First, some donors require transfusion of blood and blood products or receive large volumes of fl uids to replete their intravascular compartments. This may dilute the concentration of the antibodies, antigens, or viral particles to below the limit of detection; this process is referred to as hemodilution [ 62 ] . There are a number of ways in which hemodilution can be assessed, and no one method is currently considered the gold standard; a simple guideline is that testing may be less reliable if the donor has received greater than 2 L of blood or crystalloid within 48 h of blood sampling or greater than 1 L of crystalloid within 1 h of sampling in adults; recommendations are more strict for pediatric donors [ 62 , 63 ] . Second, some donors may lose their serologic response to certain infections over time, particularly if they are immunosuppressed. Thirdly, in infant donors, serologic testing may detect the presence of maternal antibodies without active infection of the child [ 64 ] .",

            "text": "The type of donor affect s testing as well. In general, there are two types of donors: living and deceased donors. The major differences between these donor types are the potential quality of the donor history and the time frame during which donor screening may take place. In the case of living donation, the actual donor is interviewed, which may allow for collection of a more accurate medical and behavioral history. The quality of the medical and behavioral history is more challenging in deceased donation in which the histories are obtained from friends and family members who may not know all of the medical or behavioral details-especially if there was limited contact between the donor and the historian. Often, the clinical circumstances leading to the death of the deceased donor may contribute to this limitation-often donors are found down and accurate history about the preceding events may be limited [ 13 , 15 ] . Likewise, donors may have undergone extensive resuscitation and/or a prolonged hospitalization that will affect donor screening and infectious risk-secondary to hemodilution as discussed above or by introduction of infection at the time of transfusion [ 7 , 11 ] . There may be a signifi cant time frame between initial screening and organ donation in the case of a living donor. As such, consideration of repeat testing closer to the time of the transplantation should be considered, and current policy recommends that HIV, HBV, and HCV screening of all living donors be performed within 28 days of the transplant [ 65 ] . When time allows, donors may be treated for potentially transmissible infections, such as latent TB, prior to the transplant, decreasing the transmission risk. Lastly, the period of time between initial evaluation and transplantation allows one to screen living donors with risk factors for contracting blood-borne viral infections, such as HIV, HBV, and HCV. In increased risk living donors, as defi ned by the 2013 Public Health Services Guidelines [ 20 ] , counseling to abstain from the increased risk behaviors and repeat NAT and serologic testing over a period of time similar to the window period for the virus of interest should be considered to minimize the risk of an occult transmission [ 20 ] .",

All potential recipients should also be screened either clinically or serologically for a history of exposure to varicella-zoster virus to allow pre-transplant vaccination of unexposed candidates [ 51 , 78 ] . Recipients may have been exposed to pathogens with regional endemicity. Careful travel and residence history should be obtained from all potential recipients to determine if specialized testing is indicated. Chagas disease can reactivate in asymptomatic, latently affected recipients [ 67 ] . Since Chagas is endemic throughout much of Mexico and Central and South America, consideration of screening potential candidates from affected countries should be considered. Since the approved serologic tests lack specifi city, confi rmatory testing is recommended; patients with confi rmed positive serologic screening should be evaluated by an expert in Chagas disease before proceeding for transplantation [ 53 , 67 ] . Strongyloides is a parasitic infection that is endemic to tropical and subtropical regions of the world. Infection may remain latent after initial infection with risk of potentially lethal hyperinfection in immunosuppressed patients, particularly those who receive steroids [ 79 ] . Reactivation with associated mortality has been well described in the setting of solid organ transplantation [ 79 , 80 ] . As a result, serology for strongyloides and/or testing of stool for ova and parasites should be considered in all at-risk transplant candidates [ 80 ] . Lastly, some centers test patients who have lived in areas with high endemicity for Coccidioides immitis for serologic exposure to the fungus [ 81 ] . There is no role in testing recipients by serology for histoplasmosis or blastomycosis [ 82 ] .",

Serologic evidence of protection, as demonstrated by HBs antibody seropositivity, would potentially allow the use of a core-positive alone or HBV-infected organ in a protected recipient. Likewise, patients without prior exposure to varicella-zoster virus are at increased risk of severe infection if exposed posttransplant. Nonimmune transplant candidates should be vaccinated against varicella unless they have a contraindication to vaccination. Lastly, although there are not a lot of data regarding measles and mumps posttransplant, given recent outbreaks of these diseases in the United States and abroad, measles and mumps immunity should be ensured prior to transplantation, especially in candidates born after the vaccine era (after 1963).",

Often, a single donor provides organs to recipients at multiple different centers or recipients that are cared for by different management teams at the same center. As a result, multiple recipients may present with similar clinical illnesses, but the clustering of this illness goes unrecognized [ 16 ] . Likewise, pathogens that are commonly recognized as causing nosocomial infections may not be recognized as a potential donorderived infection [ 41 , 42 ] . Finally, onset of disease may be of variable severity in individuals and may present with variable onset posttransplant, further challenging the recognition of donor-derived transmission [ 11 , 15 , 90 ] . To overcome these challenges, it is critical that all transplant centers: 1. Maintain a high level of suspicion for donor-derived infection in all early infections or unexplained clinical illnesses. Any early infection or unexplained clinical illness should lead to an inquiry as to the clinical status of other recipients. This is most easily done through contact with the local OPO. This is especially true for patients with unexplained neurological or severe illness within the fi rst 30-60 days posttransplant. 2. Develop a plan for reporting concern for a potential donor-derived infection transmission. This plan should include a local contact at the transplant center and at the OPO when there is concern for a potential donor-derived infection transmission. Likewise, it is important to consider the transplant center's risk management policies to determine if others within your institution need to be alerted. This plan should also include whom the OPO should contact at your center if there are questions about the status of recipients based on queries generated from other centers. Some have found appointing a specifi c surgeon and transplant infectious disease consultant as the early points of contact facilitate the clear transmission of data.",

Since HBV vaccine only contains hepatitis B surface antigen, vaccinated donors should only have HBV surface antibody (HBsAb), but not HBcAb. If HBsAg is measured early after vaccination, it can be detected in the blood [ 97 , 98 ] . The risk of transmission of HBV to a nonimmune recipient is high in HBsAg-positive donors [ 99 ] ; use of these organs is discussed further in the chapter on Hepatitis B. Although HBsAgpositive donors may have been deferred in the past, advances in the use of hepatitis B immune globulin and anti-HBV antivirals now allow the selective use of these organs [ 99 ] . Donors that have isolated HBcAb positivity may represent latently infected individuals or a false-positive result. The risk of transmission of HBV in liver transplant recipients is higher than in non-liver recipients [ 100 ] . The risk of transmission of HBV from a donor with and isolated HBcAb is estimated to be less than 5% for non-liver recipients [ 55 , 101 , 102 ] . Additional testing of these donors with HBcore IgM and HBV DNA NAT would further stratify the risk of transmission, with the highest risk in the IgM+ and NAT+ donor [ 55 ] . Some centers use these organs, particularly in patients who have been vaccinated against hepatitis B [ 55 ] . When used in nonimmune patients, posttransplant vaccination is often combined with the use of either anti-HBV antiviral prophylaxis or hepatitis B immune globulin infusions [ 55 ] . All recipients, especially liver recipients, of HBsAg+ or HBcAb+ donors should be monitored closely for the presence of active viral replication with expansion of therapy based on these results [ 55 , 103 , 104 ] .",

Therefore, the use of HCV NAT in donor screening allows for differentiation between prior HCV infection and active infection with viremia. Use of HCV-positive donors for HCV-negative recipients is currently considered only in life-threatening situations; however, HCV-positive donor organs should be considered in HCV-infected recipients [ 106 -109 ] . Small, likely clinically insignifi cant, decreases have been found in transplant graft and patient survival when HCV+ organs are used for HCV-infected recipients, but these are offset by the concomitant decrease in transplant waiting list time [ 108 ] . Mortality appears to be higher among heart recipients, so the use of HCV seropositive donors is less frequently considered [ 110 -112 ] . One concern relates to infecting a recipient with an additional HCV genotype that may be less responsive to antiviral therapy, since genotype results are typically not known at the time of transplant. With the advent of new and evolving data regarding direct-acting antivirals and interferon-free HCV regimens, the options to treat HCV before and after transplant are continuously changing.",

As of 2011, molecular screening methods using NAT for HIV, HBV, and HCV screening had been implemented by most US organ procurement organizations[ 56 ]. In 2014, OPTN policy was updated to mandate HCV NAT for all deceased donor screening and HIV NAT for screening of increased risk organ donors[ 20 , 57 ].",
