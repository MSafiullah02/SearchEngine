            "text": "\nGeraniaceae family plants (Pelargonium sp.) are perennial medicinal and essential oil-yielding branched herbs, growing in subtropical and temperate climates. Pelargonium genus comprises more than 750 species, and most of them originated from Europe and Africa. They have remarkable commercial applications due to their characteristic essential oil. The essential oil distillate of a high-value Geraniaceae plant, rose-scented geranium (Fig. 12.1), has a very strong, pleasant and rosy fragrance with a minty top; therefore, it is used as a substitution of the expensive rose oil, and is also known as \u2018poor man\u2019s rose oil\u2019. The essential oil of rose-scented geranium was extensively used as a flavouring agent in the food, cosmetic, perfumery, and pharmaceutical industries. The rose-scented geranium essential oil is also well known for its effectiveness in various health-related treatments such as aromatherapy and for its antimicrobial properties (Narnoliya et al. 2017, 2018a; Jadaun et al. 2017). In India, geranium was introduced in the nineteenth century in the southern climate, and now it grows in different parts of India. They are also used as ornamental plants, for example, Pelargonium x hortorum and Pelargonium graveolens, and grown in gardens and parks to provide a pleasant fragrance (Ravindra and Kulkarni 2015).\n",

            "text": "There are four species of geranium which have commercial applications: zonal geranium (Pelargonium x hortorum), scented geranium (Pelargonium sp.), regal pelargonium (Pelargonium x domesticum) and regal ivy geranium (Pelargonium peltatum). The essential oil of geranium is synthesized in specialized cells known as trichomes. The vegetative and reproductive organs of rose-scented geranium are reported to have non-glandular and glandular trichomes. Generally, glandular trichomes are the major reservoirs for essential oil (Boukhris et al. 2013; Narnoliya et al. 2017). More than 200 species of geranium occur naturally, out of which P. graveolens, P. odoratissimum, P. radens, and P. capitatum are more commonly used for harvesting the essential oil. The hydro-distillation method is commonly used for extraction of oil from the aerial part, especially leaves and stem. Essential oil of rose-scented geranium is composed of complex volatile phytochemicals, produced as secondary metabolites, such as terpenes, esters, aldehydes, ketones, alcohols, and phenols. Generally, they play a crucial role in ecological adjustment of the plant and protect it from pathogen and herbivore attacks. Thus, essential oil components are the key substances of rose-scented geranium for its defence system (Babu and Kaul 2005; Jadaun et al. 2017; Ravindra and Kulkarni 2015).",

There are three main components, linalool, citronellol and geraniol, and their esters, which constitute more than 60% of total essential oil, and they are responsible for determining its odour. Other components are menthone, nerol, isomenthone, rose oxides, terpineol, pinene and myrcene (Jadaun et al. 2017; Ravindra and Kulkarni 2015). Thus, terpenes are the major contributors in the essential oil of rose-scented geranium, and these terpenes are biosynthesized through the terpenoid pathway. It was less explored in terms of its genomics, transcriptomics, gene expression and enzyme characterization. Recently, the transcriptomic information of rose-scented geranium leaf has been reported, which provides a foundation for the molecular study of primary and secondary metabolism (Narnoliya et al. 2017, 2018a). Recently, a gene, 1-deoxy-d-xylulose-5-phosphate synthase (DXS) was cloned from this plant and its recombinant protein was physico-kinetically characterized and heterologously overexpressed in Withania somnifera to evaluate the effect of DXS on withanolides (Jadaun et al. 2017).",

            "text": "Rose-scented geranium is famous for its fragrance produced by its high-value essential oil.  Aroma and fragrance of an oil depend on its composition.  Essential oil of geranium contains more than 200 types of organic compounds, of which, terpenes, phenylpropanoids, and some other low molecular weight phytoconstituents occur predominantly (Table 12.1). Terpenes constitute the major part of essential oil. Terpene is composed of a five-carbon isoprene unit (CH2-C (CH3)-CH-CH2). The common formula of terpene is (C5H8)n, where \u2018n\u2019 is the number of isoprene units. Further, depending on the number of isoprene units, terpenes are classified into different categories such as monoterpenes (2 isoprene units, i.e., 10 carbons), sesquiterpenes (3 isoprene units, i.e., 15 carbons), diterpenes (4 isoprene units, i.e., 20 carbons), triterpenes (6 isoprene units, i.e., 30 carbons) and tetraterpenes (8 isoprene units, i.e., 40 carbons). In essential oil, these terpenes are present either in their simple form or in alcoholic, ketonic, aldehyde, and ester forms, and sometimes as chlorinated or oxygenated derivatives. On the basis of carbon arrangement, these terpenes are present in different structures like acyclic, monocyclic, and bicyclic structures.\n",

Approximately 20\u2013170 kg/ha of essential oil was produced by the growers in different locations (Rao 2009). On the basis of available reports in the literature, it is confirmed that citronellol, geraniol, linalool, and citronellyl formate are the major phytoconstituents of geranium essential oil, but their ratio is variable with cultivation zone and season (D\u017eami\u0107 et al. 2014). Geranium, grown in Tajikistan, showed that 79 compounds acquire 95.1% of the total essential oil. In this essential oil, 37.5% citronellol, 6% geraniol, 3.7% caryophyllene oxide, 3.1% menthone, 3% linalool, 2.7% \u03b2-bourbonene, 2.1% iso-menthone, 2.0% geranyl formate, and 3.1% menthone were reported to be present (Sharopov et al. 2014). Citronellol (36.4%), and citronellyl formate (12.1%) were also found as main components of oil isolated from aerial parts of geranium, grown in Isfahan Province and Central Iran (Ghannadi et al. 2012). Essential oil of aerial parts of geranium grown in Dr. Josif Pan\u010di\u0107, an institute of medicinal plants, Belgrade, was reported to contain 55 compounds, constituting 99.32% in weight of total oil in which 59.74% and 0.49% comprises oxygenated monoterpenes and monoterpene hydrocarbons, respectively. Citronellol (24.54%), geraniol (15.33%), citronellyl formate (10.66%) and linalool (9.80%) are present predominantly (D\u017eami\u0107 et al. 2014).",

There is also a clear ageing effect on the composition of oil in geranium, as shown in a report by Rajeswara Rao et al. (1993) that essential oil yield (1.56%) and geraniol content (34.6%) were the highest in the youngest leaf. Essential oil yield not only varies with different cultivars, but even the same cultivar may produce essential oil of altered composition in different seasons. Different cultivars of geranium, such as Bourbon, CIM-Pawan and Kelkar, showed variations in essential oil production from 0.05% to 0.12%, depending on the season of its cultivation (Verma et al. 2014). Oil composition fluctuates with climatic conditions, as citronellol-, nerol-, geraniol- and menthone-rich oil was obtained from plants grown in temperate climates of high-altitude regions; on the other side, isomenthone-, linalool-, citronellyl formate-rich oil was found in plants grown in lower altitudes (Rajeswara Rao et al. 1990).",

An experiment was performed on growing geranium plants under water-stress conditions, and it was observed that essential oil yield was indirectly proportional to the duration of interval periods of irrigation (Putievsky et al. 1990). The nearby vegetation in cultivation area also affects oil yield and composition, as reported earlier that presence and absence of weeds affect the ratio of phytoconstituents in oil. However, some experiments showed that growing another crop at a particular distance from geranium crop does not affect the oil composition up to a significant level, and hence, income can be doubled from the same land area (Rajeswara Rao and Bhattacharya 1997; Singh et al. 2013). The phytochemical composition\nof rose-scented geranium oil is presented in Table 12.1.",

There are several evidences to prove that the MVA pathway is operated in cytosol, and endoplasmic reticulum plays a major role in the biosynthesis of sesquiterpenes (C15), triterpenes (C30), and polyterpenes, while the MEP pathway is dedicated for synthesis of isoprenes (C5), monoterpenes (C10), diterpenes (C20), and tetraterpenes (C40). The names of the pathways indicate the name of their first products such as mevalonic acid and 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate in the MVA and MEP pathways, respectively. Isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP), and dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP), generated from both the pathways, function as precursors for manufacturing a plethora of terpenes. Terpenes are biosynthesized as a result of several enzymatic reactions catalyzed by terpene synthase enzymes. For many years, MVA was thought to be solely responsible for the synthesis of terpenes, but radioactive tracer experiments revealed the discovery of the MEP pathway for terpene biosynthesis (Lichtenthaler 1999; Eisenreich et al. 2004). Although both pathways contribute to the biosynthesis of geranium essential oil, the MEP pathway is predominantly involved, as evident by the higher concentration of monoterpenes than sesquiterpenes in geranium oil (Jadaun et al. 2017).\n",

Mevalonic acid kinase (MVK) and phosphomevalonate kinase (PMK) further convert MVA into mevalonate diphosphate through the phosphorylation process.

(2012) stated that geranium oil possesses a compelling antibacterial property against clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus strain ATCC 433000, which contains multidrug-resistant capacity. Due to its antibacterial effect and almost zero toxicity, geranium oil can be used in food processing. During quiche filling, addition of geranium essential oil at different concentrations (250 ppm, 500 ppm and 1000 ppm) showed significant antibacterial property (Lis-Balchin et al. 1998). Essential oil can be applied in combination with other oils or with standard drugs, and results of such combinatorial experiments exhibit unexpectedly higher inhibitory rates. For example, when citricidal\u2122 and geranium oil were applied together, this combination showed a highly inhibitory influence against MRSA (methicillin-resistant S. aureus) and geranium oil methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (Edwards-Jones et al. 2004). Besides, S. aureus is also effective against other gram-positive strains like Bacillus cereus, and Bacillus subtilis (Silva and Fernandes 2010). Carmen and Hancu (2014) also found that geranium essential oil is able to inhibit the growth of gram-negative bacteria (E. coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Proteus mirabilis) as well as gram-positive bacteria (S. aureus, and Enterococcus faecalis). Surprisingly, geranium oil, either in free form or in capsulated form, acts as an inhibitory factor against Mycobacterium sp., the most targeted pathogen of current drug professionals. Geranium oil is effective against M. abscessus, M. massiliense, M. smegmatis, and M. avium, even at minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) [17.9\u201335.9 \u03bcg/ml] (Giongo et al. 2015). Along with Mycobacterium sp., geranium oil has potent antimicrobial activities against other screened pathogenic bacteria such as S. aureus, Streptococcus, Staphylococcus, Listeria monocytogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Salmonella enteritidis (Giongo et al. 2015).",

In this direction, the use of aqueous extract of Pelargonium sidoides root was also examined against HIV 1, and this extract showed significant anti-HIV 1 activity. The mode of action of this extract is different from previously cited mechanisms as this extract poses an inhibitory impact on the attachment of HIV 1 to host cells, and this happens due to action of its phenolic components (Helfer et al. 2014).",

In this analysis, a total of 78,943 unique transcripts were reported, out of which 51,802 contigs showed homology-based functional annotation. Further, putative gene(s) representing terpene, ascorbic acid, tartaric acid and anacardic acid (2-hydroxy-6-alkylbenzoic acid), biosynthetic pathways, hormone metabolism and transcription factors were identified. Transcriptomic study also helped in investigating 6040 simple sequence repeats (SSRs) in rose-scented geranium. The genes encoding DXS, 1-deoxy-d-xylulose reductoisomerase (DXR) and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGR) were successfully cloned, and their expression analysis was conducted in rose-scented geranium. Further, DXS gene was overexpressed homologously (rose-scented geranium) as well as heterologously (Withania somnifera), resulting in enhanced production of the essential oil (Jadaun et al. 2017).",

Geranium is also able to produce a significant quantity of tartaric acid, but the plant species specific preference for the alternative cleavage pathway was unclear.

The demand for essential oil is flourishing rapidly due to the increased awareness of its beneficial effects. It is not only useful to the perfumery and cosmetic related activities, but also used in the food and beverage industries because of its application as food additive without any known side effects. In the global market, currently, Europe accounts as the major producer of essential oil, but Asia-Pacific is also emerging as a promising continental leader in the near future (Dhananjay et al. 2010). The estimated demand of geranium oil is around 250 tons per year. The United States, France, Germany, United Kingdom, Japan and other European countries represent a good market for geranium oil. The main producers and exporters of geranium oil are China, Egypt, Algeria, and Morocco. On the differences of the origin of geranium cultivars, they are majorly divided into three main categories\u2014Reunion Island, Egyptian or North African and Chinese. In Reunion Island-type cultivar, the ratio of citronellol and geraniol is almost 1:1, and the other main components are isomenthone, citronellyl formate, and guaia-6,9-diene. Although Egyptian-type oil also contains a 1:1 ratio of citronellol and geraniol, their prominent components are citronellyl formate, isomenthone, and 10-epi-eudesmol. Chinese-type oil is dominated by citronellol and citronellyl formate with low amounts of geraniol. In grading of quality, Reunion type is followed by Egyptian, and then Chinese cultivars. The price of geranium oil ranges from $55 kg\u22121 to $110 kg\u22121, although it depends on oil quality, origin country, and market demand, but still, the price is quite high.",

Geranium is prone to several pathogens, and the most prominent are Xanthomonas campestris pv. pelargonii, Verticillium dahliae, and Botrytis cinerea. It is necessary to maintain disease-free stocks of cultivars for achieving good market prices (Dunbar 1990).

The plants grown from that meristem explant are further screened for obtaining pathogen-free plants, and presence of pathogen is tested at different stages of growth, and it can be done by keeping the regenerating plantlet under conditions favourable for growth of that pathogen. Modern techniques are more sensitive for testing pathogen contamination in plants. These techniques are enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), colorimetric assays, and polymerase chain reactions (PCR). These techniques are able to detect very low levels of infection. Several protocols have been standardized for production of disease-free geranium plants (Debergh and Maene 1977; Reuther 1982; Mithila et al. 2001).",

Meristem tip culture is a promising method for the production of virus-free plants. Meristem tips are grown on basal media with various combinations of plant growth hormones, and the meristem responds differently in different media. For example, meristem growth in basal media supplemented with \u03b1-naphthalene acetic acid (NAA) and coconut milk results only in callus formation, while supplementation of basal medium with low quantities of auxin, indole acetic acid and kinetin results in plantlet formation. Plants regenerated from virus-free meristem as explants are established as stocks of virus-free mother plants for future usage (Hakkaart and Hartel 1979). Xanthomonas pelargonii-free P. x domesticum is produced by this method (Cassells et al. 1987). Due to some drawbacks, such as low survival rate of explants in initial stages and low numbers of shoot production, this technique has limited applications at the industrial level (Desilets et al. 1993).",

By using shoot tip as an explant, shoots were induced by growing the explants on the Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium containing 2.0 mg l\u22121 of zeatin and 1.9 mg l\u22121 of indoleacetic acid (IAA) (Dunbar and Stephens 1989).

The maximum shoot regeneration was observed when hypocotyls were regenerated on IAA + zeatin or thidiazuron-supplemented media, while root explant regeneration was suggested on zeatin-supplemented media. Croke and Cassells (1997) achieved adventitious shoot regeneration from hypocotyl explants of P. x hortorum. The caulogenic potential of the root of Pelargonium x hortorum FI hybrids was determined by growing root explants on MS media supplemented with tri-iodobenzoic acid (TIBA) and thidiazuron (TDZ), and significant shoot regeneration was obtained (Doyle et al. 1999).",

During the screening of calliclones of geranium, Saxena et al. (2008a) observed two morphotypes that differed in the dentation patterns of leaves: one morphotype was with high dentated leaves (HDLs), and another was with low dentated round leaves (LDLs). HDL and LDL were different in many agronomically important traits, such as flowering time, plant height, canopy size and the number of branches and, the most important one, essential oil composition. After greenhouse trials these morphotypes were grown and observed for genetic stability (Saxena et al. 2008a, b). Two isomenthone-rich (64.4% and 67.7%) somaclones were obtained during the propagation practice of Pelargonium sp.\n(Kulkarni et al. 1998). Although, these variations in tissue culture may be spontaneous, sometimes, they can be incorporated through some agents like mutagens. In geranium, explants of \u2018Bourbon\u2019 and \u2018Narmada\u2019 cultivars were treated with N-nitroso-N-methylurea (NMU) to obtain somaclonal variations showing better oil yields (Kulkarni et al. 2014).

Hemanti was obtained, which further led to the generation of plants resistant against Alternaria alternata (Saxena et al. 2008a, b).",

In this process, the somatic cell or group of somatic cell is developed into an embryo or plants after passing through specific embryological stages without undergoing callus formation (Finer 1995). Somatic embryogenesis helps in raising identical plants as parental with fewer chances of variations. Slimmon et al. (1991) optimized somatic embryogenesis in geranium (Pelargonium x hortorum Bailey cv. Scarlet Orbit Improved) and they reported that along with indole acetic acid, other non-indolic compounds like phenylacetic acid (PAA) were capable of inducing somatic embryogenesis (Slimmon et al. 1991). For production of somatic embryo of zonal geranium, petioles and hypocotyls and, for regal geranium, petioles were used as explants (Marsolais et al. 1991). TDZ plays an important role in somatic embryogenesis of geranium, and it was further proved by its application on different explants such as intact seedlings, etiolated hypocotyls and cotyledons (Qureshi and Saxena 1992; Visser et al. 1992; Hutchinson et al. 1997; Haensch 2004).",

Different factors affecting somatic embryogenesis were also studied such as hormonal doses, pH, basal media composition and genotype. In the case of Pelargonium \u00d7 hederifolium \u2018Bonete\u2019, when petioles were used as explants, adventitious shoot formation occurred through a mixed role of organogenesis and somatic embryogenesis mode of regeneration. Presence of TDZ along with IBA during the induction phase enhances the rate of formation of adventitious structures, and subsequently, improvement was observed in development of shoots (Wojtania et al. 2004). Somatic embryogenesis was also induced in Pelargonium sidoides DC, using somatic cells of inflorescence, shoots and petioles in the presence of TDZ (Duchow et al. 2015). Presence of a symbiotic bacterium positively influenced the somatic embryogenesis phenomenon in P. x hortorum (cv. Ringo Rose) (Visser-Tenyenhuis et al. 1994). Later, identification of this bacterium revealed that it has homology with Bacillus circulans, and inoculation of this bacterium with explants enhances the regeneration process in Pelargonium x hortorum (Murthy et al. 1999).",

In geranium, several efforts were put in to achieve model cultivars with desired attributes. The first report of geranium transformation was presented by Pellegrineschi et al. (1994); they infected the stem and leaves with Agrobacterium rhizogenes, and the plants that regenerated from these transformed roots exhibited some major changes that differed from the original plant, such as higher leaf and branch number, altered root morphology, reduced height and increased concentration of geraniol and other aromatic components. In 1995, Robichon and his colleagues first showed the Agrobacterium tumefaciens (strain EHA101, binary plasmid pKHG3)-mediated transformation of Pelargonium x hortorum using cotyledons and hypocotyls as explants (Robichon et al. 1995). All the regenerated plants contained normal morphology and all were fertile. In another study, different strains of Agrobacterium tumefaciens (strain LBA4404 and strain LBG66) were used for raising stable transgenic lines of geranium (KrishnaRaj et al. 1997).",

In this study, they optimized different factors responsible for enhancement of transformation efficiency such as nature and source of explants, type and concentration of phytohormone and, most importantly, addition of a phenolic substance acetosyringone (100 \u03bcM) in the pre-culture and co-cultivation period. Transgenic geranium (Pelargonium sp. \u2018Frensham\u2019) plants were raised through Agrobacterium-mediated genetic transformation, and the binary vector had a gene encoding an antimicrobial protein, Ace-AMP1. The transgenic plants showed resistance against Botrytis cinerea, a pathogen causing leaf infection (Bi et al. 1999). Transgenic plants of Pelargonium x hortorum and P. capitatum were generated using a modified transformation protocol with two strains of Agrobacterium tumefaciens, EHA101 and LBA440 (Hassanein et al. 2005). Many more attempts were made to improve the agronomic traits of geranium such as improvement in oil quality (Saxena et al. 2007). Winkelmann et al. (2005) reported an efficient regeneration system and genetic transformation protocol for Pelargonium zonale and Pelargonium peltatum hybrids. Agrobacterium rhizogenes-mediated genetic transformation of Pelargonium sidoides was established for enhancing the content of essential metabolites (Colling et al. 2010). Recently, Singh et al. (2017) showed a modified Agrobacterium tumefaciens (LBA4404)-mediated transformation protocol for generation of transgenic plants of Pelargonium graveolens (cv. CIM-BIO171).",

Significant work has been undertaken for improvements in its agronomic traits; however, the functional characterization of genes related to its primary as well as secondary metabolite biosynthesis pathways, especially essential oil biosynthesis pathway, is required at a more vigorous pace. Further, their regulatory elements should be identified and isolated so that the pathway machinery could be manipulated in a desired direction. The protocols for in vitro regeneration and plant transformation were well optimized, which are helpful in incorporation of favourable traits in geranium crop. However, the limitation in geranium is that it has so many species and cultivars, which differ at a high level in their morphology and ploidy level, so any technique optimized for one cultivar may or may not work for another cultivar. Therefore, extensive research is required to enhance the market value of a wide range of cultivars. The industrial importance of geranium depends on the quality of essential oil, so efforts are needed to produce such varieties, which can sustain challenges in the marketing route. Therefore, there is a need to produce improved genotypes, either through classical breeding or through genetic engineering approaches, so that plants with improved essential oil profiling and yield, which exhibit resistance to cold seasons and drought, good aroma, large flower size, altered flower colour and disease-resistant properties can be developed. Interspecific hybridization for the pyramiding of desirable genes can be beneficial in obtaining high oil-yielding varieties. Recent biotechnological and synthetic biology avenues have remarkable potential to further improve geranium for its societal importance.",
