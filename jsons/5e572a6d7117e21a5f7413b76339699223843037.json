These measures include schools and universities closure, reduced working hours, and increased production and delivery of equipment such as masks, gloves and hygienic materials for sterile environments. The government has also made efforts to divulge high-quality information concerning the COVID-19 and to provide laboratories and hospitals with diagnostic kits and adequate resources to treat patients. However, despite such efforts, the number of cases and deaths has progressively increased with rising trends in total confirmed cases and deaths, as well as in new daily cases and deaths associated with the COVID-19. Iran is a developing country and its economic infrastructure has been hit hardly by embargo and sanctions. While developed countries have allocated appropriate funding and are responding adequately to the COVID-19 pandemics, Iran has experienced a serious surge of cases and deaths and should strive to provide additional resources to the health system to make healthcare services more accessible and to increase the fairness of that access. All relevant actors and stakeholders should work together to fight this disease.",

As a first step, the government allocated 5 billion Tomans to the National Headquarters for the management and control of the outbreak and the country's medical universities to counteract the burden of the COVID-19 and strengthen the healthcare system. This funding was employed to buy masks, disinfectants and related equipment. Given the population of about 13 million people in Tehran, the capital of Iran and the population density in this metropolitan area, 5 billion Tomans were allocated to equip hospitals and provide essential supplies and rewards to healthcare providers. Also, in the third step, further 5 billion Tomans were allocated to better manage disease control in Qom and Gilan provinces where initially the number of patients was high. Also, the MoHME provided 5 billion Tomans to compensate for physicians, nurses and health personnel in controlling the outbreak [2, 4] .",

This is equivalent to reducing income and creating new costs due to the burden of disease. One of the most important financing policies in different countries is to implement programs that do not deprive people of access to health services due to increased out-of-pocket (OOP) payments. Financing the health system is a very important key to ensuring equity in the delivery of health services [10] . However, the COVID-19 pandemics is having a huge impact on different parts of the country, which should strive to ensure flexibility in financing the health system and compensating for the increased costs of disease-related services [11] . A very positive point in the Iranian health system is the attention paid in recent years to the issue of health. The launch of the HTP, the increase of new funding to this sector, especially in the light of the COVID-19 crisis, indicate that the implementation of health policies requires serious government support, commitment and prioritization of this crisis [5] .",

Also, the overall number of hospital beds has significantly increased by 25% from 108,000 to more than 130,000, with about 50,000 old beds being renovated. Another major challenge of the Iranian health system in the past was the shortage of ambulances, with 30 air ambulances bases being recently established in Iran. Hospitals have been equipped also with CT, which is crucial for diagnosing the COVID-19 and clinical records have been computerized. To perform an active follow-up in urban and rural areas and to ensure that poor people are guaranteed access, the MoHME has established an electronic health record system during the HTP. Data from this electronic system were combined with data from the Civil Registry Office as well as economic data. Families in various geographical areas were tracked by telephone, and their family's symptoms were checked. People with current or future early symptoms were called to access to selected health centers; in poor areas, people were granted access to diagnostic and treatment services and were given the addresses of centers where they could be examined. These health centers are part of the country's health network, which has been developed in rural areas since long time, whereas it has been established in some urban areas (especially those marginalized) in recent years [17, 18] .",
