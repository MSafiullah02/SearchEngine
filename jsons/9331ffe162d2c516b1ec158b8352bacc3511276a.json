In the convalescent period, the level of IFN-\u03b3 increased obviously. Studies conducted in animal models have proven the prominent role of CD8+ T cells in respiratory viral clearance (8) . Research investigating the immune responses in patients with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection found that the early CD8+ T cell response was associated with the severity of the disease (9) . Effective T cell responses could help clear MERS-CoV efficiently and avoid a high level of plasma pro-inflammatory cytokines which can cause strong inflammatory and eventually lead to lung tissue injury. It seemed that CD8+ T cell response was also relevant to the severity of COVID-19 infections. In an adult with severe COVID-19 infection, the counts of CD4 and CD8 T cells in peripheral blood were found to decrease substantially (10) . In this study, the child with severe 2019-nCoV pneumonia had low CD3+CD8+ lymphocyte count and low CD3+CD8+ lymphocyte percentage on admission, while the counts of CD3+CD8+ lymphocytes, percentages of CD3+, CD3+CD8+ lymphocytes were higher in 2019-nCoV pneumonia group compared with those in RSV pneumonia group. RSV is a common pathogen of infantile pneumonia, and can cause severe lower respiratory tract infection. CD8+ T cell counts in children with RSV infection were found significantly lower compared with healthy children (11) . Effective CD8+ T cell activation might be one of the reasons why the symptoms of pneumonia in most children with 2019-nCoV pneumonia were mild to moderate. We speculated that the effective CD8+ T cell response had an important role in the development of 2019-nCoV pneumonia and CD8+ T cell could be used as a biomarker to predict the prognosis of COVID-19 infection. CD4+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) are important in efficiently activating the CD8+ T cell response to acute respiratory virus infection in the early stage of the infection (12) . CD4+Treg was detected in part of the children studied.

The anti-inflammatory effects of IL-10 can help the host tolerate infection and avoid pulmonary injury caused by an extensive immune response. However, on the other hand, the inhibition of protective immunity by IL-10 can dampen the clearance of pulmonary pathogens (13) . IL-10 could be secreted by regulatory B lymphocytes (Breg). A study about neonatal-specific regulatory B (nBreg) cells in human neonates with RSV infection showed that the RSV-infected nBreg increased the severity of the infection by producing IL-10 and weakening Th1 cell responses (14) . In this study, Breg was not detected.

In this study, of 30 children with 2019-nCoV pneumonia who underwent the detection of cytokines, IL-10 level obviously increased in 2 children, one of who developed severe 2019-nCoV pneumonia. It seemed that IL10 was also relevant to the severity of the 2019-nCoV infection and the adaptable change in IL-10 level contributed to the relatively slight pneumonia symptoms in children.

IL-10 was significantly higher in children with RSV pneumonia while there were no significant differences in IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3 (Figure 2).In children with 2019-nCoV pneumonia IL-6 ranged from1.74 to 120.31 pg /ml and rose in 6 children according to the normal reference range provided by the test reports. IL-10 ranged from 2.29 to 34.91pg/ml in children with 2019-nCoV pneumonia, and increased in 10 children, among whom 6 children were with a slight increase of IL-10 (less than twice the value of maximal normal reference), and 2 children were with an obvious increase (more than three times the value of maximal normal reference). One of the two children who were with an obvious increase in IL-10 developed severe 2019-nCoV pneumonia.", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF3": {"text": "The initiation and regulation of innate and adaptive immune responses played a pivotal role in controlling viral infections and mitigating immune-mediated injury.

As no blood samples could be obtained from healthy children, we could not get direct evidence about the role of the studied lymphocyte subsets and cytokines in the development of 2019-nCoV pneumonia by comparing with healthy children. However, we tried to find some profile of the immune response by comparing the lymphocyte subsets and cytokines in 2019-nCoV pneumonia group with those in the RSV pneumonia group and made some deduction from what has already known about RSV pneumonia. The results found in the study could be used as clues of the immune response in 2019-nCoV pneumonia in further study. Secondly, the number of patients in the study was very limited. As there was only one child who suffered from severe 2019-nCoV pneumonia during the study period, the exact reason for severe 2019-nCoV pneumonia in children could not be confirmed by only one case. Conclusion Immune response played a very important role in the development of 2019-nCoV pneumonia. The effective CD8+ T cell response might influence the severity of 2019-nCoV pneumonia. The adaptable change in IL-10 level might contribute to the relatively mild pneumonia symptoms in children with 2019-nCoV pneumonia and bacterial co-infection might be a risk factor of severe 2019-nCoV pneumonia.", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF5": {"text": "Figure legends", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF6": {"text": "in group A were normally distributed and were presented as means with standard deviations.", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF7": {"text": "Serum cytokine profile of children with 2019-nCoV pneumonia and children with RSV pneumonia A 2019-nCoV pneumonia children B RSV pneumonia children Serum cytokine values were non-normally distributed and were presented as medians with inter-quartile range (IQR) The fluctuation of CRP, PCT, lymphocyte subsets and serum cytokine concentrations of the child with severe 2019-nCoV pneumoniaThe blood samples for the detection were collected on day1, day2, day4, day5, day9, day11, day14 and day16 after admission to hospitalFigure 1", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF8": {"text": "Figure 2", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "TABREF0": {"text": "The patients' demographic data and laboratory findings Normally distributed continuous variables were reported as means with standard deviations (SD) and compared with Student's t test.Non-normally distributed continuous variables were reported as medians with inter-quartile range (IQR) and compared with Mann-Whitney U test.c Categorical data were reported as proportions(n with %)and compared using Chi-square test", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF1": {"text": "Blood lymphocyte subsets of children with 2019-nCoV pneumonia and children withCD3+ CD 8+(n/\u03bcl) [mean (sd)]Normally distributed continuous variables were reported as means with standard deviations (SD) and compared with Student's t test.Non-normally distributed continuous variables were reported as medians with inter-quartile range (IQR) and compared with Mann-Whitney U test.", "latex": null, "type": "table"}}, "back_matter": [{"text": "The authors thank all the staff of Wuhan Children's Hospital (Wuhan, China) for their contributions to the study.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Acknowledgment"}, {"text": "This research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Funding"}]}
