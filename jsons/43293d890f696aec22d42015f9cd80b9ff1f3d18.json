Thus, a hope to resolve the etiology of SARS has prompted a search for genetic variants in candidate susceptibility genes. Individual susceptibility to SARS-CoV infection seems to be variable. For example, subjects seropositive for SARS-CoV may develop SARS or have only mildly symptomatic infections [4] . Like that of other major infectious diseases [5, 6] , the development of SARS may also be the result of a complex interaction between the microbe, host genetic factors, and the environment. Early reports have shown that higher age, diabetes mellitus, and heart disease are risk factors for the development of SARS [7, 8] , but the extent to which genetic factors might influence susceptibility to SARS-CoV infection remains unknown.",

Indeed, recent case-control studies have suggested an association between the development of SARS and HLA-B*4601, HLA-B*0703, and HLA-DRB1*0301 [9, 10] . Although the adaptive immune response is a highly effective defense mechanism against SARS-CoV, a potential weakness is the time delay between the recognition of a new pathogen and the production of sufficient antibodies to provide protection. Specific antibodies can be detected \u044310 days after the onset of symptoms (mean time, 20 days) [2] . Thus, other factors, in addition to antibodies, are likely to determine the differences in susceptibility during this vulnerable period. In addition to the adaptive immune response, there exists an innate immune response that involves a series of soluble and membrane-bound proteins that bind and facilitate the killing and clearance of invading microbes [11, 12] . This innate immune response is present from birth and provides the first line of defense for the human body. The variability in the response to SARS-CoV suggests that the innate immune response might be involved in an individual's susceptibility to SARS-CoV infection during the period before the production of specific antibodies.",

MBL is an acute-phase reactant of hepatic origin that can bind through multiple lectin domains to repeating mannose and N-acetylglucosamine sugar motifs that are characteristically displayed at high densities on bacterial and fungal cells and on viruses and protozoa but not on mammalian cells [16, 17] . After binding to a pathogen, MBL initiates at least 2 protective functions that are well defined. First, through the lectin pathway, MBL can mediate the activation of the complement system without the participation of antibodies; second, MBL can promote opsonophagocytosis by collectin receptors directly [18] [19] [20] . Experiments in vitro and in vivo have shown that an MBL deficiency is likely to have a major effect on innate immune activation and appears to predispose individuals to serious infection [21, 22] .",

Individuals with any heterozygous variant have only \u223c10% of the MBL plasma concentrations that those with the wild type have, and those with homozygous or compound heterozygous variants have almost undetectable MBL plasma concentrations [23, 24] . In addition, polymorphisms at nt \u03ea550, \u03ea221, and 4 (referred to as the H/L, Y/X, and P/Q variants, respectively) in the promoter region, which are reported to control MBL plasma concentrations of structurally normal proteins, have also been described [25, 26] . Moreover, the combination of structural polymorphisms and promoter polymorphisms in this gene results in well-described MBL expression groups (high, medium, and low) [25, 26] .

AF080508.1), were designed on the basis of size and overlap of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplicons. The screening panel included DNA from 174 individuals randomly selected, without regard to disease status, from the total study population of 744 individuals. The primers for the target regions were designed using the Web-based software Primer3 (available at: http://www-genome.wi.mit.edu/). DNA samples from the 174 individuals were amplified and purified. Then the PCR products were sequenced using an ABI PRISM Dye Terminator Sequencing Kit with Amplitaq DNA polymer- ase (ABI) and loaded onto an ABI 3730 sequencer. Polymorphism candidates were identified by the PolyPhred program (available at: http://droog.mbt.washington.edu/PolyPhred.html) and were inspected by 2 observers.

The frequencies of the variant alleles H/L, Y/X, and P/Q measured here-that is, 0.445, 0.141, and 0.144, respectively-are very similar to those reported in other Chinese subpopulations [24, 32] .

We therefore selected the variants H/L, Y/X, P/Q, and A/B as markers for use in the subsequent genotyping analysis. Table 2 indicates that the genotype distributions of the 4 mutations in any patient category or in control subjects were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. On the basis of unconditional logistic regression analysis with adjustments for age and sex, a statistically significant association was observed between susceptibility to SARS-CoV infection and having the codon 54 variant. Subjects that were homozygous or heterozygous for the variant B allele (i.e., the B/B or the A/B genotype) had an increased susceptibility to SARS-CoV infection, compared with those homozygous for the wild-type A allele (P 1 , P 2 , and P 3 ) (table 2). The association remained P p .00031 significant even after correction for multiple comparisons. The nt \u03ea221 promoter variant showed only a marginally significant association with susceptibility to SARS-CoV infection, but this type of association was not observed after correction for multiple testing.

            "text": "Several association studies have shown that, in both children and adults, the MBL gene is related to the susceptibility to various specific infections [19, [27] [28] [29] . Most of the results, however, could not be replicated in subsequent studies in other populations because of multiple factors, such as small sample size, marginal statistical significance, genotyping complex-ity, or ethnic heterogeneity in the study groups. Although the highly significant association between MBL deficiency and increased susceptibility to SARS-CoV infection derives from a biologically based a priori hypothesis, our initial finding should be independently verified in other subpopulations of ethnic Chinese origin (e.g., Guangdong, Taiwanese, or Hong Kong Chinese) or in those of different ancestry, such as whites.",

First, individuals who harbor the susceptibility genotype in the MBL gene are at high risk for developing SARS. The usefulness of general screenings to detect MBL mutations and MBL deficiency in a defense against future SARS outbreaks should be determined. Second, vaccines against SARS are expected to exert a greater influence in the future control of SARS. Our results may help in the selection of candidates for vaccination and in the confirmation of effective vaccines for high-risk groups. Third, replacement MBL therapy has been used in patients with repeated infections, and a possible beneficial effect was seen [38] . The usefulness of this intervention in SARS might merit assessment. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, this study helps to explain why, in most settings, the attack rate for SARS is much lower than that for most respiratory viruses. In fact, in the present study, the frequencies of the genotype and haplotype pairs conferring protection from SARS-CoV infection were very high. For example, the frequencies of the codon 54 A/A genotype and high-MBL expression haplotype pairs reached 76.8% and 74.5%, respectively (table 2) .",

If this association is real, then the variant B allele is associated with a relatively low fraction of SARS-CoV infection in the Chinese individuals studied here, thereby suggesting that other genes are likely to modify the susceptibility to such an infection. When many susceptibility genes are identified and gene-gene interactions among polymorphisms in these genes are taken into account, the prediction of the susceptibility to SARS-CoV infection may become more accurate.",
