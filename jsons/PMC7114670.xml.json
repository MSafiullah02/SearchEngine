Models of transmission dynamics are increasingly applied to inform infectious disease control, but such models require relevant data on contact patterns as inputs [2]. Healthcare workers (HCWs) may be the inadvertent interface between the healthcare setting and the community for such infections. The HCWs' role as a vector for spreading pathogens to patients in the hospital setting is well recognized, and occupational infections among HCWs have been frequently documented, both for common pathogens circulating in the healthcare setting, as well as some newly emerged or re-emerging pathogens [3], [4], [5]. HCWs may thus contribute to disease transmission from the hospital to the community and vice versa [6], [7]. Moreover, over the past two decades, nosocomial outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus, and Ebola virus disease have emphasized how the healthcare setting may amplify the transmission of an infection that has newly emerged in a community [8], [9], [10]. Hence it is worthwhile to describe and compare the contact patterns which occur in the healthcare setting alongside those in the community among working adults in the general population.",

            "text": "A 24 h paper diary was previously used to compare nurses' daily contacts with those of matched controls from the general population in Germany [11]. Nurses' differed substantially from the general population in the number of total contacts, contacts where physical touch occurred, and in the duration of contacts. However, we found no other studies comparing the contacts of other types of HCWs with the general population. Contacts for other HCWs have been studied in specific units (e.g. general wards, emergency departments) within the healthcare setting, often using proximity-sensing technologies which focus on paired HCW\u2013patient and HCW\u2013HCW contacts [12], [13]. These studies found that nurses had more patient contacts than other HCWs. However, it remains unclear how contacts for other HCW types compare across different settings, and with individuals of similar age in the community, which may have implications for the transmission of pathogens into and out of the healthcare setting to the community. Moreover, modelling studies of disease transmission rely heavily on assumptions about contacts between key risk groups. In the absence of better data, some attempts to model transmission in healthcare settings have had to make simplifying assumptions about the nature of work-related contacts in HCWs relative to the general population, and neglect potential differences in risk that may arise from the variation in contacts among HCWs [14], [15].",

To optimize manpower deployment, the study was rolled out sequentially from TTSH to NUH to KTPH from 2013 to 2016. A convenience recruitment strategy was used when enrolling the participants. In TTSH, nurses were recruited during their standard team meeting whereas non-nursing HCWs were recruited individually when they were working in the wards by study team members. HCWs in NUH were recruited through recruitment posters distributed via the hospital's intranet. Participants from KTPH were recruited during their standard ward-based team meeting. The study was explained to consenting HCWs, who were then asked to complete the diary with contacts that occurred during a 24 h period starting at 05:00 for the survey date. The study team would collect the completed contact diaries once informed by the participant. To avoid biases related to day-of-week effects on the contacts of HCW participants, the study team pre-assigned the day-of-week (using a random number generator), and instructed the participants to complete the survey for that pre-assigned day-of-week within two weeks of enrolment.",

We showed that this is also true for other HCW types, who on the average had even more total work-related contacts than nurses. Furthermore, we found that many of the interactions involving HCWs are effectively new contacts, i.e. persons they do not meet daily or even weekly. By contrast, community-based working adults largely work with the same set of individuals on a daily basis. The right-skewed distribution for community-based working adults (Figure 2C) suggests that a small minority have much higher numbers of work-related contacts, including new contacts; these may represent individuals in other service industries. However, while severely ill individuals are less likely to use services such as retail and food-and-beverage in the community, they will almost always present to \u2013 and moreover have physical interactions at \u2013 health facilities. The large number of new work-related physical contacts increases HCWs' risk of encountering and hence acquiring an infectious disease, especially because they provide healthcare services to patients who potentially present with an infection. Moreover, the large number of new contacts reported by HCWs implies that non-HCW contacts encountered at health facilities by an infectious individual would also mostly be new contacts. This may be what makes the healthcare setting a potent amplifier for certain types of infection. HCWs been reported to have a higher infection rate for influenza, measles, and tuberculosis [18], [19], [20]. In recent years, the possible role of the health facility in amplifying transmission for emerging infections such as SARS, MERS-CoV, and Ebola virus disease has also been highlighted, with nosocomial transmission being implicated in several large outbreaks [8], [9], [10], [21], [22]. We believe that nosocomial amplification arises partially because of the high numbers of new contacts among HCWs, and other patients and their visitors, which potentially allows the infection to spread beyond the immediate family members of an infectious individual [8], [23].",

            "text": "However, among HCWs, our study also revealed important differences which may affect their potential to spread various infectious diseases. Besides the type of HCW, other factors including the institution, age, and sex did not substantially affect HCWs' work-related contacts. Previous studies suggest that nursing staff had more work-related contacts in the ward environment, but we found that, considering their scope of work at the hospital level over an entire work day, doctors had the highest number of work-related contacts [24], [25]. However, both ward-based and clinic-based nurses reported high numbers of physical contacts; ward-based nurses reported the fewest contacts, but had the highest number of longer-duration contacts (\u226515 min) where physical touch occurred, and clinic-based nurses had high numbers of short duration (<15 min) contacts, most of which were effectively new contacts. HCWs in different settings may hence vary in their risk for acquiring and spreading pathogens with different dominant modes of transmission. For instance, physical contact has been confirmed to play a key role in the transmission of antibiotic-resistant bacteria such as meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus\n[26]. However, it is unclear how the risk arising from the inpatient environment, with more physical contacts of longer duration, might compare with clinic environments with higher numbers of new contacts. And although ward-based nurses had fewer total and new contacts, they seemed to be at higher risk of infection compared to other HCW types during the SARS outbreak in Singapore in 2003 [8], [27]. We suggest that longer contact durations may be needed for transmitting infections with less or intermittent pathogen shedding. Whereas the duration of contacts has been described elsewhere, there have been few studies integrating both the number and duration of contacts into a model to describe their combined impact on the potential pathways of transmission for different infections [2], [28], [29], [30]. Our study provides some of the key parameters needed to model such transmission, by re-examining the interaction between various contact characteristics, and incorporating information on whether the contacts are new (which increases the probability of encountering an infectious case) or recurrent (which effectively increases the duration of exposure). Although this has previously been neglected in some infectious disease transmission models, it is what will inform us on the relative vulnerabilities of types of HCW and setting when preventing different nosocomial infections.",

Consequently, we are uncertain as to the representativeness of our study, and we had a great diversity in the types of HCW which was difficult to control for. Even within the broad groupings, we acknowledge that our analyses in some categories were limited to relatively small numbers. Second, our study was based on paper contact diaries, which have been shown to suffer from underreporting of contacts, and overestimation of contact durations [31]. Underreporting is of particular concern for short contacts, with longer contacts being better reported, and, despite our reminders to participants to report all their contacts, our study remains subject to such biases. Moreover, it is challenging to independently verify the overall accuracy of such diary-based surveys of contacts. Third, since we standardized the format of the paper diary for both the HCWs and the general population, this limited the recording of more detailed contacts among HCWs such as the classes of persons contacted (i.e. nurses, doctors, allied HCWs, patients or visitors). Also, the format of the survey meant that we were unable to collect information on individual contact episodes with each person they had contact with, and hence we were unable to quantify the extent to which personal protective equipment (such as gloves, gowns and masks) was used in the interactions with patients. To do so without interfering with the HCWs' routines would have required the use of other methods such as those based on direct observation of HCW\u2013patient interactions [32], [33]. Finally, our definition of a \u2018significant contact\u2019, though similar to previous contact diary surveys, may not capture all instances where transmission could occur, for instance for respiratory pathogens where transmission could potentially arise through being in the same physical space for a prolonged period, even without physical touch or conversation [34].",

Whereas doctors had the most contacts, nurses had more skin-to-skin touch and contacts of a longer duration, which would increase their risk for acquiring and spreading infections where physical contact or prolonged exposure is important for transmission. These observations may explain why health facilities are vulnerable to amplifying transmission of emerging infections, and the differential risk of various types of HCWs.
