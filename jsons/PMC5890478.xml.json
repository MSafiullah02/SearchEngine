Patients admitted to a study hospital were eligible for enrollment if they resided within the hospital catchment area and had evidence of acute respiratory infection and radiographically confirmed pneumonia within 72 hours of admission. Patients were included in the etiologic analysis if they (1) met final radiographic criteria for CAP based on a study radiologist review and (2) had specimens available for both bacterial and viral testing. Clinical, demographic, and epidemiologic information were collected through interviews and medical chart review. Informed consent was obtained, and the study protocol was approved by institutional review boards at each institution and the CDC.",

Serologic testing for select viruses (AdV, HMPV, influenza A and B, PIV, and RSV) was performed on available paired acute and convalescent serum specimens. Influenza serology used both hemagglutination inhibition and microneutralization assays to define positive results [14, 15], and serology for other viruses was based on CDC-developed indirect immunoglobulin (Ig)G enzyme immunoassays [11, 12]. Bacterial culture was performed on specimens from blood, sputum, pleural fluid, endotracheal aspirates, and bronchoalveolar lavage. To test for specific bacteria, PCR assays were performed (1) on all available pleural fluid specimens from adults and children and (2) on whole blood specimens from children only.

We performed multiple imputation to calculate missing values for AdV, HMPV, influenza, PIV, and RSV serology tests (the viruses for which both PCR and serology tests were performed). Multiple imputation uses a multivariable regression model [16\u201318] that is fit using data from patients for whom the outcome (serology result) is available, to impute a value for patients whose result is missing; this method may be useful when patients had a negative PCR result for a given virus but had a missing serology result. Multiple imputation is based on the assumption that serology results are missing at random [16, 17]. We assessed the assumption of data missing at random by comparing demographic and clinical characteristics among patients with and without available serology results using \u03c72 or Fisher\u2019s exact tests, considering statistical significance (P < .05). To create the multivariable logistic regression model used for imputation, among patients with available serology results, we first determined which variables were significantly associated with positive serology results in bivariate analyses. Second, we constructed \u201ca priori\u201d models with positive serology as the outcome using age (ordinal variable), sex, any bacterial detection, and the corresponding viral PCR result as predictors (Supplementary Data). We also considered age as a categorical variable, which did not meaningfully change our results. Third, we identified which of the variables that were significant in bivariate analyses remained significant when added to the multivariable a priori model. Variables considered included symptoms, underlying medical conditions, radiographic findings, intensive care unit admission, and influenza season (Supplementary Data). Fourth, we used the area under the curve (AUC) to determine whether we would include a variable in the final regression model: the variable was included in the final model only if the AUC was higher for the a priori model when the variable was added to the model compared with the model without that variable. The AUC ranged from 0.5 to 1, with higher values indicating better discrimination of the model at predicting patients with positive versus negative serology results. In addition, we evaluated model fit using the Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test (models with P < .05 were rejected). Separate models were constructed for children and adults for each virus. Twenty imputed datasets were created for improved efficiency [19] and pooled (Supplementary Data).",

It is notable that the largest absolute increase was for influenza among children (4.4%), and the largest relative increase was for AdV among adults (3-fold); however, the CI for this imputed AdV estimate was wide. The reasons for the differences in the multiple imputation results compared with observed results are likely multifactorial. Serology has been shown to increase the diagnostic yield for AdV, HMPV, PIV, and RSV by 3.0%\u201386.7% [11, 12, 22] and for influenza viruses by 15%\u2013130% [3, 4, 11, 12] when compared with PCR across all ages. The diagnostic yield of one method versus another may differ by age, because we observed in the EPIC study that the diagnostic yields for AdV, HMPV, PIV, and RSV were 11.8%\u201348.9% among children and adults [22]. These differences indicate that serology increases diagnostic yield for most viruses but differs by specific virus and age of the patient. In addition, serology may capture detections missed by PCR because of late collection of NP/OP specimens relative to illness onset, inadequate sample collection or preservation, or collection of an NP/OP specimen before onset of viral shedding.",

However, we did not observe a meaningful change in the virus-specific prevalence when excluding patients for whom NP/OP specimens were collected after 7 days from illness onset (Supplementary Tables S2 and S4). Ultimately, the increases in virus-specific proportions were due to the increase in serologic detections estimated through multiple imputation. For patients who had a positive PCR result and missing serology, imputing missing serology would not have increased the virus-specific proportion because the positive PCR result would have already contributed to the proportion. Thus, an increase in virus-specific proportion would have been observed only if an observed PCR result is negative and an imputed serology result is positive. Our analysis quantified these increases in virus-specific detections by using multiple imputation, demonstrating the utility of this method when data are missing.",

Although we observed differences between patients with and without available serology results, it does not necessarily indicate a major violation of the assumption. Systematic differences can occur between patients with and without missing data even when data are missing at random; these differences can be explained by other observed variables [23]. After accounting for these differences through a sensitivity analysis, the multiple imputation estimates were overall similar to those from the main analysis; the only exceptions were AdV among children and PIV among adults, but the difference in these assessments may be partly explained by sparse data within strata.",

For example, in a randomized trial of an indoor wood smoke emission intervention to prevent childhood pneumonia, approximately one third of children had an incomplete assessment of various pneumonia outcomes due to missing data on physician diagnosis, respiratory pathogen testing, and/or chest radiograph. By applying multiple imputation, some significant associations were observed for specific pneumonia outcomes, and the authors considered these outcomes based on imputation to be reliable effect estimates [24]. In addition, 2 meta-analyses estimated the global burden of pediatric respiratory infections due to seasonal influenza [25] and RSV [26] using multiple imputation when necessary to account for missing incidence data.",

First, imputing missing data assumed they were missing at random; evaluation of \u201cmissingness\u201d demonstrated that differences existed between those with and without serology specimens available, but those differences were minimal. Second, estimates from multiple imputation were sensitive to the independent variables used and the strength of their association with serology results among patients with available data. This concern may be minimal because we used the viral PCR result as an independent variable, which was a strong predictor of the paired serology result. Third, although not a limitation of this analysis, the detection of viruses in NP/OP swabs is not necessarily indicative of the cause of CAP [27, 28] and may represent (1) resolving infection rather than acute infection or (2) an infection limited to the upper tract and not lower tract [29]. Similarly, paired serology could represent an interval infection that occurred after the initial presentation or hospitalization and may not be indicative of the cause of the CAP hospitalization; thus, including viral serology results in any analysis could overestimate the true viral burden of CAP. Fourth, we combined influenza A and B viruses together and parainfluenza types 1\u20133 together, although the predictors of positive serology results may differ by each virus\u2019s type. Finally, illness onset was self- or caregiver-reported, which introduces potential recall bias. However, our sensitivity analyses indicated that virus-specific prevalence estimates did not change significantly when excluding patients who had NP/OP swabs collected after 7 days from illness onset.",

Multiple imputation estimates may help achieve more accurate disease burden estimates, better establish performance measures of the molecular assays, and inform virus-specific prevalence estimates in other studies when convalescent serum specimens are not available for all patients. Our reported higher estimates of viral-specific pneumonia prevalence based on multiple imputation underscore the need for improved respiratory viral diagnostic testing, which would better inform population-based estimates and better guide clinicians and public health policy.",
