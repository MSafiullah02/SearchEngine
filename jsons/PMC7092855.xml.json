The LRP optimization was directly conducted with serum samples collected in 2001 from two patients infected with HCV genotype 1a, referred to as JLR3037 and RJ, respectively. A large volume of serum stored at \u221270 \u00b0C was available from these two patients, which allowed repeated and detailed optimization of our LRP protocol. After the optimization, additional serum samples were used for the estimation of sensitivity, robustness, and potential recombination (see below).

First, we tested multiple RT enzymes alone or in combination, including AMV (Promega), M-MLV (Promega), Expand Reverse Transcriptase (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN), Transcriptor Reverse Transcriptase (Roche Applied Science), SuperScript II (Invitrogen), SuperScript III (Invitrogen), and rTth DNA polymerase (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) that shows reverse transcriptase activity in the presence of MnCl2 at elevated temperatures. In some experiments, we mixed a RT enzyme with Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene), a similar strategy as used in long PCR, to improve full-length cDNA synthesis [8]. Second, previous studies showed certain chemicals might improve full-length cDNA synthesis in both quantity and quality. In this study, we tried different additives at various concentrations, including DMSO (5\u201310%) (Sigma), GC-Melt (0.5 M) (BD Biosciences), DTT (5\u201310 mM), trehalose (0.6 M) (Sigma) [9], and betaine (2 M) (Sigma) [9]. Third, we designed a series of HCV-specific RT primers located at the 3\u2032 end of NS5b (Table 1\n). These primers were tested for efficient priming at different concentrations. Fourth, besides direct application of RT reaction in subsequent PCR, we also tried to purify RT reaction with or without RNase H digestion [11] prior to PCR, by using QIAquick PCR Purification Kit or QIAquick Nucleotide Removal Kit (Qiagen) or Dynabeads KilobaseBINDER Kit (Dynal) in which RT primers were biotinylated at their 5\u2032 ends. Finally, we also investigated the role of 7-deaza-2\u2032-deoxyguanosine (Sigma) in the RT reaction that may improve the elongation in GC-rich domains [10].",

At the beginning, we tested several thermostable DNA polymerases for long PCR, such as Expand Long Template PCR System (Roche Applied Science) and Elongase Enzyme Mix (Invitrogen). We eventually focused on rTth DNA polymerase, XL (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), and most of the optimization experiments were done with this enzyme. The strategy to optimize long PCR was basically similar to what we described for RT step. Multiple additives were first tested, including DMSO, betaine [12], [13], and tetramethylammonium (TMA) oxalate [14]. Next, a series of primers were tested for their efficiency with long PCR (Table 1). Meantime, since one of the mixed polymerases has 3\u2032\u20135\u2032 exonuclease \u201cproofreading\u201d activity that may degrade primers, we tested phosphorothioate primers to see if the PCR amplification is improved [15], [16], [17]. To allow hot-start PCR that may diminish non-specific priming, we adopted two measures, the use of loop incorporated primers [18] and an oligonucleotide, Trnc-21, which specially inhibits DNA polymerase isolated from Thermus thermophilus (Tth pol) at low temperature [19], [20]. Finally, with the DNA Thermal Cycler 480, we empirically fixed denaturing temperature at 94 \u00b0C for 30 s, elongation temperature at 72 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0C for 9 min, and annealing step for 30 s. However, the annealing temperature was adjusted depending on the T\nm values of the primers (Table 1).",

The viral heterogeneity has been detailed in these two patients in our previous study based on a 1.38 kb amplicon spanning the most hypervariable region 1 (HVR1) of HCV genome [21]. In brief, serum RNA was reverse transcribed with 200 U M-MLV reverse transcriptase (Promega), followed by nested PCR with Taq DNA polymerase (Applied Biosystems). The PCR product was gel purified by using QIAEX II Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen) and ligated into the pTOPO-TA cloning vector (Invitrogen).

This indicated the existence of extensive self-priming during RT presumably induced by HCV RNA secondary structure or oligonucleotides in extracted RNA template. Using the DNA Thermal Cycler 480, the whole procedure for LRP takes at least 2 days. We therefore amplified multiple small fragments (5\u2032UTR, HVR1, NS3, NS5a, and NS5b) (Table 1) by using the first round LRP product as the template. After the first round LRP, the effect of self-priming is reduced. The negative amplification of these small fragments indicated the absolute absence of full-length HCV cDNA and thus the second round LRP is not necessary. To test all LRP conditions and parameters alone or in combination, the optimization procedure consists of hundreds of protocols. Our approach that monitors the full-length cDNA synthesis based on first round PCR product, although not perfect, still improves experimental progress significantly.",

Robust LRP results were obtained when running RT with 200 U of SuperScript III at 50 \u00b0C for 75 min, followed by inactivation at 70 \u00b0C for 15 min. However, using a mixture of SuperScript III (200 U) and AMV (2.5 U) gave LRP results that were much more reproducible, with an increased yield. LRP was not successful using a mixture of RT enzyme and Pfu DNA polymerase, perhaps because the latter had low activity (<30%) in a non-optimized buffer system under RT temperature (50 \u00b0C) (Stratagene, personal communication).2.All additives (except DTT) that we tested in the RT reaction had an adverse role for LRP. Although these additives have been reported to improve full-length cDNA synthesis, they may be not compatible with SuperScript III or rTth XL DNA polymerase.3.The selection of RT primers is critical for successful LRP. The most satisfactory and reproducible results were obtained only when using QR2 as the RT primer (Table 1). Interestingly, LRP did not work when replacing QR2 with QR264 or QR274, suggesting an appropriate T\nm value of RT primers was required. However, LRP failed when modifying other RT primers into a similar T\nm value as QR2. In contrast, reproducible amplifications were obtained with other serum samples in which QR2 had one or two nucleotide substitutions. These observations suggest that efficient priming for full-length HCV cDNA synthesis is domain-dependent. Additionally, unlike previous reports [30], our LRP is acceptable with QR2 in broad range of concentrations from 0.0625 \u03bcM to 1 \u03bcM.4.There was no obvious advantage but a reduced sensitivity when purifying RT reaction by using Qiagen spin columns or Dynabeads. Similarly, the use of 7-deaza-2\u2032-deoxyguanosine in RT reaction or RNase H digestion was not advantageous.\n",

This makes it potentially promising to reconcile the two buffer systems, but information about additional buffer components is not available and therefore optimization cannot be performed. There was no improvement and sometimes even an adverse effect of other measures including the addition of additives (DMSO, betaine, and TMA oxalate) and the use of phosphorothioate or loop incorporated primers. However, Trnc-21, an oligonucleoide inhibitor to rTth DNA polymerase, was required for reproducible amplification. The minimum concentration of Trnc-21 is 0.4 \u03bcM.

Since pSMART vectors from CopyRight and Clone Smart Blunt Cloning Kits contain multiple terminators that eliminate transcription both into and out of the insert DNA and therefore reduce potential toxicity of the insert, the instability of recombinant clones may be responsible for the high background with false positive clones. We therefore constructed pClone vector that contains pBR origin and restriction sites not found in HCV genome. With this conventional strategy, the LRP product was successfully cloned with DH10B E. coli cells but not Stbl4 cells. Positive rate for recombinant clones was about 30% which is much higher than previous reports [31], [32].

It has also been applied to the amplification of cellular RNA derived from such genes as the neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) and polycystic kidney disease 1 (PKD1) genes [39], [40]. In these studies, a common feature was the availability of good RNA templates in both quantity and quality. In contrast, HCV cannot be easily cultured in vitro although there are recent reports of the establishment of HCV cell culture by using a special HCV genotype 2a strain JFH-1 [41], [42], [43]. Clinical samples from patients infected with HCV have a relatively low titer of viral RNA level. In addition, HCV holds a strong structure along with the whole genome [4], [5], [6]. These features may explain the limited success of LRP with HCV. While there have been occasional reports regarding the amplification of near full-length HCV genome [44], [45], reproducible results were only obtained with the amplification of less than 5 kb fragments in HCV [7], [33], [46], [47]. In contrast, the protocol we have described here has considerable robustness. Besides the two serum samples that we used for optimizing our protocols, we successfully amplified a near full-length HCV genome from an additional 24 patient samples infected with HCV genotype 1a. We identified several critical factors for efficient amplification of a near full-length HCV genome. First, the RT step was conducted by using mixed enzymes, SuperScript III and AMV. SuperScript III is a mutant form of SuperScript II, which makes it fully active at temperature as high as 55 \u00b0C. Potential RNA secondary structure could be melted at this temperature. However, incubation at 55 \u00b0C resulted in decreased sensitivity perhaps due to the partial degradation of the RNA templates. In the optimized protocol, we used 50 \u00b0C for the RT reaction. It has been reported that AMV especially favors the reverse transcription of genes with GC-rich domains or strong secondary structure due to its stability at higher temperatures. It is not known how these two enzymes work together, but similar cooperativity has been observed for mixed DNA polymerases in long PCR [1]. In any case, we demonstrated that mixed RT enzymes improve full-length HCV cDNA synthesis in both quality and quantity. Second, not all primers can effectively prime the synthesis of full-length HCV cDNA. In our experiments, only one primer, QR2, met this requirement, indicating the full-length HCV cDNA synthesis is considerably dependent on the appropriate priming site. To some extent, this observation is consistent with a previous report in which differential priming of RNA templates resulted in obvious differences in both accuracy and reproducibility of RT-PCR [48]. Third, the use of Trnc-21 in PCR steps is recommended. Inclusion of Trnc-21 resulted in automated hot-start PCR amplification. Although there are several techniques available for the initiation of \u201chot-start\u201d PCR, such as manual control, the use of wax, and the addition of antibodies to thermal stable DNA ploymerases, none of them is as efficient and convenient as Trnc-21. Finally, the primers for PCR procedures should have appropriate T\nm values dependent on the annealing/elongation temperatures. Our last optimization step for successful LRP was to raise the annealing/elongation temperature to 72 \u00b0C in the second round of PCR, around 5 \u00b0C above the primer T\nm values. The large difference between annealing/elongation temperatures and primer T\nm values resulted in non-specific amplification while a low annealing/elongation temperature less than 60 \u00b0C always abrogated the amplification.",

            "text": "There are two salient features for our LRP procedure: the lack of detectable recombination and the preservation of viral diversity, as estimated with samples LIV19 and LIV23. Recombination is generally explained by template switching during PCR, particularly when the synthesis of complementary strands is stopped prematurely. The lack of detectable recombination in our LRP protocol may have contributed to the reduced cycle numbers (60 cycles versus regular 70 cycles) and Vent DNA polymerase that is included within rTth DNA polymerase, XL, and has 3\u2032\u20135\u2032 exonuclease proofreading activity. The HVR1 is located at the 5\u2032 end of HCV E2 domain and is the most variable region along the entire HCV genome. By comparing genetic parameters for HVR1 quasispecies profiles, our LRP protocol preserves viral heterogeneity, as also reported with a 5 kb HCV amplicon [33]. Furthermore, similar HVR1 quasispecies lineages were obtained with sample LIV19 while sample LIV23 displayed much different HVR1 quasispecies lineages derived from either the 1.38 kb or the 9.1 kb amplicon. By using clones as direct PCR templates, we failed to amplify HVR1 domain by screening 40 clones that had no correct insert confirmed with enzyme digestion after miniculture (data not shown). This excludes the possibility for the loss of potential HVR1 quasispecies lineages during the culture due to the instability of recombinant clones. Thus, these results again emphasize the bias of HVR1 quasispecies amplification when using different primer pairs as we previously reported [49]. Still, defective interfering particles (DIP) are another factor to be taken into account. The generation of DIP, natural viral mutants with large deletions in the genome, seems to be a general phenomenon for all viruses, including HCV [50], [51]. Quasispecies profiles contributed by DIP could be lost in our protocol since we gel purified only the 9.1 kb fragment prior to cloning. Taken together, the quantitation of viral diversity, if present at a high level within a given sample, is largely underestimated and/or biased by current protocols for PCR amplification and cloning.",

            "text": "The technology described here should be applicable to other HCV genotypes as well as other RNA viruses such as GB virus C, HIV, and dengue virus. With the amplification and efficient cloning of a near full-length viral genome, it is now possible to study linked mutations at genome-wide scale. Linked mutation is a common strategy exploited by viruses to counter their loss of the fitness resulting from point mutations at immune and/or drug targets. The identification of common patterns of linked mutation is helpful for the improvement of combinational antiviral strategies. In addition, our LRP protocol preserves HCV diversity and has no detectable recombination induced by PCR. These characteristics make it possible to isolate dominant, subdominant, and minor viral variants within a complex virus population, which facilitates the approach of reverse genetics. An initial step in reverse genetics is to construct vectors containing full-length viral genomes, usually assembled by overlapped PCR products that represent viral consensus sequences. However, the consensus sequence is artificial in concept and is not necessarily the dominant viral variant. As a result, replication from infectious clones with consensus viral genome may not occur. This may partially explain why the infectious HCV clone of H77 consensus did not replicate in cell culture while the one with JHF1 did [41], [42], [43]. In contrast to the existence of multiple HVR1 quasispecies lineages in the patient H77 [52], JHF1 was derived from a patient with fulminant hepatitis. The immunocomprised status in this patient resulted in an extremely homogeneous viral population by cloning analysis of HVR1 domain [53]. In such a situation, consensus viral sequence may be equal to authentic dominant viral variant that makes an \u201cinfectious\u201d clone infectious.",
