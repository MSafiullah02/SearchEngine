G-quartets stack on top of each other to give rise to G-quadruplexes that are further stabilized by the interaction with monovalent cations. DNA strands in G-quadruplex may be oriented in anti-parallel, parallel, or hybrid configuration, and the nucleotide linkers between G-quartet stacks can adopt a multitude of loop structures (Patel et al., 2007, Phan, 2010, Phan et al., 2006, Simonsson, 2001).",

In viruses, evidence of significant G-quadruplex regions is increasingly being recognized. In the Epstein\u2013Barr herpes virus (EBV), G-quadruplexes modulate EBV nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA1) activity and translation (Murat et al., 2014); in particular, BRACO-19 inhibited EBNA1-dependent stimulation of viral DNA replication (Norseen et al., 2009). In HIV-1, we have demonstrated a G-quadruplex-mediated transcriptional silencing activity in the SP1 binding region of the long terminal repeat promoter (Perrone et al., 2013a) and in the Nef coding gene (Perrone et al., 2013b). In both cases, G-quadruplex ligands were able to stabilize the G-quadruplex conformations and to exert antiviral activity (Perrone et al., 2014). In the SARS coronavirus, G-quadruplexes targeting by a key viral protein was proposed to control host\u2019s cell response to viral infection (Tan et al., 2009).",

The HSV-1 genome is composed of two covalently linked regions of unique sequences, the unique long (UL) and unique short (US) sequences, flanked by large inverted repeated sequences, TRL\u2013IRL and IRS\u2013TRS (Fig. 1b) (Hayward et al., 1975). HSV replication is temporally regulated in rounds of transcription that yield immediate-early, early and late proteins. HSV-1 is a neurotropic virus: after the first lytic infection within mucosal epithelial cells, the virus enters sensory neurons where latency is established. The virus can later reactivate resulting in the generation of new virions that cause recurrent disease (Roizman et al., 2013). HSV-1 most commonly causes vesicular lesions affecting the mucous membranes; however, it can also cause infrequent but serious diseases, such as encephalitis, disseminated neonatal infections and visceral infections in immunocompromised patients (Frangoul et al., 2007, Genereau et al., 1996). The presence of HSV increases sexual transmission of HIV-1 (Freeman et al., 2006).",

The gp054 series sequences displayed the G4XTG4XTG4XTG4XT common motif, where X was either a T or a C base, and covered about 220 bps. Four more putative QGRS were clustered at the terminal and internal repeats (both long and short) (Fig. 1b, Table 1): they covered about 900 bps in the leading strand and 700 bps in the lagging strand. The exact role of these regions is as yet unknown and thus these positions were named \u201cun\u201d. All identified sequences were highly conserved among different HSV-1 strains (Table 1). The only exception was the unb sequence, which was identical to gp054b, and was not conserved in the KOS strain. To note that all identified sequences, apart from un3, were characterized by four GGGG-tracts, therefore possessing the ability to fold into 4-tetrad stacked G-quadruplex. This kind of tetraplex is in principle very stable, as denoted by the high G-scores, which indicate the propensity of a sequence to fold into unimolecular G-quadruplex, obtained by these oligonucleotides (Table 1). The un3 sequence displayed four GGG-tracts therefore gaining a lower G-score.",

Usually, G-quadruplex folding occurs in the presence of K+, while in the absence of the monovalent cation oligonucleotides are mostly unfolded. The HSV-1 oligonucleotides, however, displayed peaks characteristic of the G-quadruplex conformation even in the absence of K+ (Fig. S1). Stability of HSV-1 G-quadruplexes in the presence of K+ was assessed by thermal denaturation experiments monitored by CD and UV spectroscopy. Un2 and un3 were the most stable G-quadruplexes with T\nm above 95 \u00b0C, followed by gp054 oligonucleotides. (Fig. 2b, Table 2\n). Because of the very low solubility of un1 in K+, T\nm values for this sequence were not obtained. In the absence of K+, un3 was the least stable sequence, followed by un1. Un2 and gp054 oligonucleotides showed comparable stability, with the exception of gp054d, which was extremely stable even in the absence of K+ (Table 2).",

Un1 (29-bp) and un2 (28-bp) also migrated faster than the 22-long control marker (see * symbol in Fig. 2c), indicating effective folding.

In the presence of K+ (Fig. 2d), all sequences displayed increased migration indicating effective folding.

Upon addition of BRACO-19 the intensity of the initial stop sites dramatically increased (lanes 4, Fig. 3); moreover, an additional intense stop site corresponding to a second G-rich region was observed in the un2 template, possibly indicating the presence of multiple G-quadruplex structures.

Both viral transcripts were decreased to 30\u201340% at 24 h.p.i. (Fig. 4b) and this effect was specific for the HSV-1 transcripts (Fig. S4a). The mRNA levels of representative immediate-early and early proteins, whose coding sequences lacked important G-quadruplex forming regions, were also analyzed: BRACO-19 did not affect transcription of these earlier proteins (Fig. 4b). Moreover, TMPyP2 reduced HSV-1 transcript levels to a low extent (100\u201380%) and it did not differentiate among the different kinetic groups of proteins. The fact that both analyzed late transcripts were affected by BRACO-19 to a similar degree indicates that the observed effect is independent of the presence of QGRS in the UL36 coding sequence; the absence of effect on earlier genes indicates that the compound likely exerts it activity against G-quadruplex-controlled viral mechanisms that mostly influence transcription of late proteins. Since the identified clusters of QGRS were mostly present in non-coding repetitive-element regions, we tested the possibility that QGRS folding induced by BRACO-19 inhibited polymerase processing at the viral DNA level.",

Amplified DNA corresponding to G-quadruplex regions decreased in a concentration dependent manner in the presence of BRACO-19 (Fig. 5\na, un and gp054, BRACO-19). In contrast, BRACO-19 was not able to disrupt polymerase processing in the non-G-quadruplex region (Fig. 5a, non-G4, BRACO-19) and TMPyP2 had no effect in both G-rich and non-G-rich regions (Fig. 5a, un, gp054, non-G4, TMPyP2). Real-time PCR was employed for quantification purposes. Amplification of the G-quadruplex region was inhibited up to 40% (with respect to the non-treated control, 100%) in the presence of BRACO-19 (4 \u03bcM), while no effect was detected in the non-G-quadruplex region (Fig. 5b), confirming lack of activity of the compound against the polymerase enzyme. No activity of TMPyP2 was observed. This data demonstrate that BRACO-19 specifically interacts with G-quadruplex regions in the HSV-1 genome in vitro and inhibits polymerase processing likely due to the steric hindrance caused by multiple tetraplex structures stabilized by the ligand.",
