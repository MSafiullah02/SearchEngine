            "text": "The association between bats and human disease has been acknowledged for over a century, since the first identification of rabies Lyssavirus in asymptomatic vampire bats in 1911 [1]. Until recently, rabies dominated the scientific literature on bats and disease; however, following the emergence of horse- and human-infecting Hendra virus from Australian flying foxes in 1994 [2], bats have emerged as potential reservoirs (see Glossary) for a broad variety of zoonotic infections involving particularly virulent \u2013 and often fatal \u2013 RNA viruses. Although isolation of live virus from bat hosts has proven elusive in certain cases \u2013 notably that of Ebola [3] \u2013 major evidence supports the role of bats as reservoirs for Hendra and Nipah henipaviruses, Ebola and Marburg filoviruses, and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and likely Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronaviruses (CoVs), as well 4, 5. Following the identification of Rhinolophus spp. bats as reservoirs for SARS-CoV [6], Calisher et al. explored links between bats and emerging viruses in a review highlighting various aspects of bat life history and ecology \u2013 including ability to fly, dependency on torpor and/or hibernation, long life span, and gregarious social structure \u2013 that are likely to influence bats\u2019 roles as viral reservoirs [4]. In an attempt to explain bats\u2019 tolerance of otherwise virulent viruses, these earlier authors emphasized a deep coevolutionary relationship between bat genomes and those of lyssaviruses [7] and henipaviruses [8]. We explore evolutionary mechanisms enabling this immunological tolerance in bats that may be lacking in non-volant mammals, including humans.",

            "text": "Although not the most represented mammalian order among zoonotic hosts, bats host more zoonotic viruses per species than do rodents and most of the resulting zoonoses have been high-profile spillover incidents of extreme human pathogenicity [21]. Bats largely host viral pathogens without demonstrating ostensible disease [22], but the pathogenicity is complex and research into impacts of viral infection on bat fitness, particularly with respect to fecundity or longevity, has been critically lacking. Obvious exceptions to viral asymptomaticity in bats include, notably, rabies and Tacaribe virus, a South American Arenavirus that caused widespread bat mortality in the 1950s and in later experimental infections [23]. Adenoviruses have also been linked to bat mortality [24], although such patterns are perhaps unsurprising given the disparity between this gastrointestinal system-infecting DNA virus and other bat-affiliated (mostly RNA) viruses discussed here. One study demonstrated seasonal amplification of RNA viruses, but not DNA viruses, in a monitored insectivorous bat colony in Europe [25], suggesting that different mechanisms of control may be at play for RNA versus DNA viruses in bat hosts. Additionally, a novel filovirus, Lloviu virus, was recently detected in bat tissues following a massive die-off event [26], and although originally cited as the cause of bat mortality Lloviu virus has now been resolved to be a uniquely bat-adapted virus, leading researchers to explore other mechanisms for bat mortality in this incident [27]. In one study examining causes of mortality in 486 deceased bats in Europe, viral infections (lyssaviruses and adenoviruses) were responsible for only five of 144 identified disease-related deaths [28].",

Bats also exhibit coevolutionary specificity with erythrocytic Bartonella spp. bacteria [31]. On a par with viruses, bats appear to host both classes of protozoa and Bartonella spp. without ostensible disease symptoms, yet they exhibit pronounced pathology following infection with certain extracellular pathogens, chiefly Borellia spp. [32] and some enteric bacteria [33]. Bats also experience pathology on infection with the bacterium Pasteurella multocida\n[34], which can function as both an intra- and extracellular pathogen.

This pronounced immunopathological response to fungal infection is particularly germane to the current widespread infection of North American bats with the extracellular fungus Pseudogymnoascus destructans (the causative agent of WNS). Histological wing lesions characteristic of WNS suggest massive immunopathological inflammation when hibernating bats infected with P. destructans arouse from torpor [41].",

By contrast, pathogens that predominantly occupy the extracellular space present considerable challenges for bat immune systems. In the case of trypanosomes, it should be noted that, although largely extracellular, trypanosomes also support an intracellular, amastigote life stage that is subject to the majority of immunological attack and regulation [42].

            "text": "Like other mammals, bat immune systems comprise both innate and adaptive elements (Figure 1\n) [22]. The first line of innate immune defense involves classification of pathogens into broad microbial categories by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), typically localized in dendritic cells, that enable the host to mount a pathogen-appropriate immune response (Box 1\n) [43]. PRRs are well conserved between bats and other mammalian lineages and the bat immune system capably detects a broad range of viruses, bacteria, and fungi [44]. PRR detection of foreign microbes produces a cascade of cytokine signaling specific to the class of microbe encountered. These cytokines serve as signaling molecules for cell-mediated components of the innate immune system [i.e., recruitment of phagocytic neutrophils and monocytes and cytotoxic natural killer (NK) cells] and drive T cell differentiation in the adaptive immune system. In the humoral immune system, the body's complement cascade constitutes the main innate immune component, while B lymphocytes, their daughter plasma cells, and the antibodies they synthesize represent the adaptive component.Box 1Pathogen recognition, host immune defense, and the mitochondria\nTransmembrane versus cytosolic PRRs\nPRRs located within the cellular membrane are capable of recognizing both intra- and extracellular pathogens, while cytosolic PRRs are generally restricted to recognition of intracellular pathogens, chiefly viruses or bacteria [43]. Transmembrane Toll-like receptors (TLRs) have long been acknowledged for their viral recognition role in the mammalian immune system, but the discovery of a new class of cytosolic PRR, the retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I)-like receptors (RLRs), offers an alternative pathway implicated in the immune recognition of RNA viruses [89].\nPathogen recognition and cytokine induction\nIn humans, pathogen recognition via TLRs induces cytokines such as IL-12, which recruit neutrophils and monocytes of the innate immune system and stimulate the Th1 branch of the cell-mediated components of the adaptive immune system. Pathogen (usually virus) recognition by RLRs also upregulates Th1 pathways of adaptive immunity, but does so through induction of the cytokine IFN-\u03b3, which favors NK cell routes of innate immunity. By contrast, extracellular fungi are detected at dectin-1 PRRs that induce IL-23, the cytokine responsible for upregulation of the Th17 branch of cell-mediated adaptive immunity [43].\nA role for the mitochondria\nIntriguingly, RLR signaling appears to require the participation of a protein (MAVS) bound in the outer membrane of the cellular mitochondria, thus necessitating a role for mitochondria in viral immunity. Mitochondria have long been recognized for their role in general cell maintenance, damage repair, and apoptosis, a process initiated by PRR recognition of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), which include mitochondrial ROS. PRRs recognize and respond to pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) in a similar way [90]. With the recent discovery of RLRs and their localization to the mitochondria, awareness of the underappreciated role of the mitochondria in immune function is growing.",

Bats do mount antibody responses to various infections, including lyssaviruses, filoviruses, and henipaviruses, but these responses are sometimes idiosyncratic [16]. In particular, antibody recruitment has been demonstrated to be delayed post-immune challenge in bat cells compared with other vertebrates [45] and repeated rabies inoculations over a longitudinal time series produce a discontinuous pattern of adaptive immunity in which antibodies in seemingly immune bats sometimes drop below detectable levels altogether or virus and antibody (but not disease) are detected concurrently [46]. Other work demonstrates heightened seroprevalence in female bats during periods of pregnancy and lactation with waning antibodies across the rest of the year, as well as heightened seroprevalence in bats of both sexes under nutritionally stressed conditions [47]. These findings suggest that bats may exhibit increased reliance on adaptive immunity when normal immunological pathways used to control infections are otherwise compromised. As heightened viral shedding and concomitant spillover events have been linked to bat reproduction for both henipaviruses and filoviruses 47, 48, it is possible that humoral adaptive immunity is less effective at controlling viral transmission than bats\u2019 standard mechanism of immune regulation.",

Type I interferons include IFN-\u03b1 and -\u03b2, which are secreted by various cells to recruit macrophages and NK cells against viral infections or tumors. Many viruses work to antagonize signaling pathways for type I interferons in infected hosts. Antagonism of type I and complementary type III interferons has been demonstrated in both human and bat cell lines in response to Henipavirus infection [51], suggesting that bats might control Henipavirus replication by some non-IFN-mediated mechanism. Bats also possess type II interferon, IFN-\u03b3, which generally functions to coordinate a systemic response involving both innate and adaptive immune pathways against microparasitic infections; IFN-\u03b3 was the first-recognized IFN in early viral studies in bat hosts [50]. Although much work remains to be done in this field, several major mammalian cytokines have now been documented in bats, including all major inducers of T helper (Th) cell-mediated adaptive immunity: Th1 [interleukin (IL)-12 and IFN-\u03b3], Th2 (IL-4 and IL-10), and Th17 (IL-6 and IL-23) 23, 52.",

Reported delays in recruitment of B and T lymphocytes in bat immune systems post-infection are consistent with these hypotheses of truncated immune response, or tolerance \u2013 an immunological strategy typical of an asymptomatic pathogen reservoir [55]. Bats appear capable of restricting immune responses to avoid immunopathology on infection with certain pathogens with which they share a deep evolutionary history. The recent discovery of endogenous viral elements in animal genomes indicates that bat immune systems might be able to tolerate these pathogens on recognition as elements of \u2018self\u2019 [56]. This bat pathogen tolerance is not universal, however, and bats experience severe morbidity and mortality as a result of infection with some viral [23], bacterial 32, 33, and fungal pathogens [41]. In most cases, it is the host immunopathological response to infection, rather than the pathogen itself, that is most responsible for mortality [55]. One major possible exception to this is rabies-related mortality, in which the virus may cause direct pathology in the central nervous system while simultaneously evading immune detection altogether [57]. In the case of WNS, bats experience uncontrolled neutrophilic inflammation, an immunopathological response, on arousal from hibernation [41].",

As recent research highlights growing acknowledgement of the central role of mitochondria in cellular signaling and immune defense [58], we suggest that bats may control pathogenesis in microbe-invaded cells via processes of autophagy and apoptosis that originally evolved to regulate metabolic stress, thus avoiding the usual immunopathological consequences of heightened immune response. By definition, these control mechanisms will be limited to intracellular pathways, leaving bats vulnerable to suffering the immunopathological consequences of attempts to clear extracellular infections.",

Bats\u2019 minimal thermoregulatory abilities have been acknowledged for some time [59]; bat body temperatures appear to directly approximate ambient air temperature when at rest, meaning that bats in flight regularly maintain temperatures above 40\u00b0C, a level typifying high fever in other mammals [59]. Fever is an acknowledged adaptive mechanism through which the body elevates temperatures above those optimal for invading pathogens while also accelerating metabolic and immune processes [60]. Empirical work demonstrates that virus-inoculated bats preferentially maintain viruses in the blood stream rather than in tissue at elevated ambient temperatures; viral clearance then proceeds without demonstrable antibody response, thus suggesting a role for some adaptive, non-humoral form of immune control [50].",

Typically, metabolically costly activities such as flight yield byproducts in the form of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which damage cell structure and mitochondrial DNA. Basal metabolic rates are not well characterized in bats, but bats are known to experience high variation in metabolic rate, being capable of achieving rates up to 34 times their resting levels when in flight compared with an eightfold increase in metabolic rate in exercising rodents [64]. Despite this, some bats species live for over 40 years in the wild [62] and average lifespans in bats significantly exceed those of comparably sized non-volant mammals [65].",

In humans, BAT plays a role in thermogenesis in neonates, and in both hibernating rodents and bats it is thought to aid in torpor arousal, as the mitochondrion-rich tissue (called \u2018brown fat\u2019 because of the color induced from heavy mitochondrial loading) can exceed the temperature of the surrounding tissue by as much as 3\u00b0C during the late stages of hibernation arousal [67]. As brown fat loading in bats is known to vary seasonally and reach a minimum during periods of lactation [68], this reduction in mitochondrial load could help explain bats\u2019 increased reliance on adaptive immune defenses during the reproductive period. Early studies investigating impacts of hibernation on pathogenesis of rabies in bat hosts have demonstrated the presence of rabies virus in chiropteran BAT when absent in other tissues, thus leading scientists to posit a role for long-term viral storage in chiropteran brown fat [69].",

Measures of the important mammalian antioxidant superoxide dismutase (SOD) in the same analysis did not vary among species, causing the author to suggest that bats might simply generate fewer ROS in more-efficient mitochondria than comparable non-volant mammals. Alternatively, a different endogenous antioxidant enzyme may be responsible for immediate scavenging of free radicals at the mitochondrial production site.

            "text": "The human antioxidant literature supports the idea of multiple roles for cellular ROS, some negative and some positive [74]. Mitigation of mitochondrial ROS at the site of production is important in both extending longevity and avoiding tumorigenesis, which results from oxidative damage to mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) (Box 2\n) [75]. Somewhat paradoxically, mitochondrial ROS also upregulate cellular pathways to autophagy and apoptosis, helping the cell repair this damage or self-destruct when necessary [76]. Enzymatic antioxidants are thought to act most directly on ROS within the mitochondria, while dietary antioxidants play a significant role against exogenous forms of ROS or metabolic ROS escaped from mitochondria [74]. Bats may be able to recruit enzymatic antioxidants to scavenge ROS at the site of mitochondrial production more efficiently than comparably sized non-volant mammals, thus avoiding oxidative damage to mitochondrial DNA and its negative impacts on longevity and tumorigenesis.Box 2Mitochondria, oxidative stress, and aging\nThe mitochondrial theory of aging\nNumerous pathogenic mutations have been identified in the mitochondrial genome as causative agents in neurodegenerative and aging-related human diseases [91] and the accumulation of mutations in the mitochondrial genome of cells has been unequivocally linked to accelerated aging in mouse models via pathways of mitochondrial apoptosis [92]. One popular theory suggests that the accumulation of cellular damage from ROS produced as a byproduct of metabolism are responsible for most mtDNA damage, largely due to the physical proximity of the site of most respiration-induced ROS production (i.e., the mitochondrial electron transport chain) to the relatively unprotected mitochondrial genome [93]. However, despite decades of research, the causal role of ROS in mtDNA damage and its consequences for aging remain to be fully elucidated 76, 94.\nReplicative senescence and telomere shortening\nAn alternative aging theory postulates the concept of replicative senescence, which proposes a finite lifespan of 50 \u00b1 10 mitotic divisions (the so-called \u2018Hayflick limit\u2019) for somatic cells, negating the theory of ROS-accrued progressive cellular damage [95]. Shortening of telomeres, the end caps of nuclear chromosomal DNA, indeed correlates with aging in mammalian fibroblasts and was originally posited to be a sort of replicometer, or counting device, of mitotic division [96]. More recent work indicates that the rate of telomere degradation is not constant, being hastened by oxidative stress [97] and halted or reversed via production of the enzyme telomerase [98], which functions as a prerequisite for cellular immortalization in cancer [99].\nMitochondrial\u2013nuclear crosstalk\nOngoing research highlights the role of ROS-mediated mitochondrial\u2013nuclear crosstalk in the processes of cell maintenance, aging, and apoptosis. Mitochondrial signaling, probably via changes in intracellular calcium concentration, is posited to activate certain nuclear genes involved in the induction of replicative senescence [94]. ROS also appear to function as signaling molecules, upregulating pathways of autophagy and mitophagy at low levels to remove damaged mitochondria from the cell and inducing cellular apoptosis at high levels (Figure I\n) [76]. Autophagy is believed to play an important role in cell tumor regulation via mitigation of genome damage to limit tumor necrosis and inflammation; however, defective autophagy is known to enable tumor survival in starved cells by downregulating apoptosis [100].",

As noted above, free radical oxidation upregulates cellular damage and repair pathways (via autophagy) and induces apoptosis in cells damaged beyond repair. Intracellular microparasitic pathogens are known to cause oxidative damage both directly and via the induction of cytokines that recruit monocytes, neutrophils, cytotoxic T cells, and NK cells [which generate nitric oxide (NO), a common form of ROS] at the site of infection [86]. Thus, if bat immune systems interpret intracellular pathogen infection in a manner similar to oxidative damage incurred via metabolic processes or tumorigenesis, bats\u2019 abilities to regulate these infections \u2013 via both autophagy and apoptosis \u2013 are unsurprising.

It seems safe to conclude that bats are special in their capacity to act as reservoir hosts for intracellular pathogens and this review represents a first attempt to identify some of the immunological mechanisms that underlie this ability. Bats are distinguished from other mammals by their ability to fly and processes critically involved in the evolution of this trait have yielded inadvertent consequences on their longevity and immune functioning. In particular, because flight requires bats to regularly endure wide variations in both temperature and metabolic rate, bats have developed altered mitochondrial genomes and corresponding pathways enabling the mediation of mitochondrial oxidative stress that simultaneously support long life and tumor and intracellular pathogen mediation. By contrast, bats remain vulnerable to immunopathological responses to extracellular infections and, in the case of WNS, are experiencing widespread mortality as a result. Future in vitro work characterizing and quantifying the mechanisms (i.e., PRRs, cytokines, and T lymphocytes) by which bats recognize and mount immune responses to diverse microbial classes will be influential in testing hypotheses presented here (Box 3\n). In addition, in vivo studies investigating the role of bat life history \u2013 particularly with respect to periods of hibernation and torpor \u2013 in immune functioning are likely to prove enlightening to researchers hoping to understand when and why bats operate as special pathogen reservoirs.Box 3Outstanding questions\n\u2022Which PRRs identify the different classes of microbes in bat immune systems?\u2022What is the nature of cell-mediated immunity in bats?

How might they vary among species and geographical locale? What immunocompromising factors (i.e., roost temperature, duration of hibernation, and coinfection with other pathogens) might differ between exposed European and North American bats?

Red arrows indicate possible host immune responses to infection with an intracellular pathogen (i.e., viruses, protozoa, and intracellular bacteria); blue arrows signify immunological pathways to clearance of extracellular pathogens (i.e., extracellular bacteria, fungi, and helminths). It should be noted that extracellular bacteria can also be cleared by the complement cascade.",
