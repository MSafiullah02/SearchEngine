The least squares method or nonlinear methods are used in parameter estimates. Assessment of goodness of fit is investigated by AIC and SIC criteria.

In the table, on the 5th day after modeling for each country, it was calculated as the prevalence of the indicators in the cumulative cases as %. When the table was investigated, in the first week of April it was seen that the cumulative death prevalence in Italy and Spain is the highest, followed by the Netherlands, France, UK China, Denmark, Belgium, Brazil and Sweden respectively. The daily new case proportion in cumulative cases can also be considered as an indicator of an increase or decrease in the severity of the outbreak. When this indicator was evaluated, it can be said that the highest values was observed in Belgium, USA, Canada, Poland, Ireland, Netherlands, France, and Israel, which vary between 10% and 12% and the lowest proportions was observed in China and South Korea. The daily deaths proportion in the cumulative case was low in many countries and similar. But it is lowest in Netherlands. The cumulative recovered proportion in the cumulative case is the another important criteria for outbreak. This proportion was the highest in China, followed by South Korea. However, the highest value was in Switzerland (16.45%) among the ten countries exposed to the outbreak after February 21. The prevalence was found 1.75% for Turkey. Finally, the active case proportion in cumulative case was another criterion that can be used to evaluate the course of the outbreak. The predicted active case proportions are high in most of countries. This result shows that there are many people in the active disease period. .
