            "text": "There are two types of ventilator devices. One type simply pushes a certain volume of air into the lungs mechanically without accounting for whether the patient wants to draw air into their body or to push air out. Almost all of these devices are based on the use of the conventional bag valve mask (BVM) (Hess and Kacmarek 1996). A BVM is a plastic bag that a clinical care practitioner can deflate manually with their hands, and therefore provides an inexpensive and easy way to force air into the lungs. Indeed, BVMs are applied by first responders to patients who are not breathing, rather than performing mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. All ventilator devices based on a BVM are essentially robotic arms that squeeze the bag again and again at a set frequency. These devices can be manufactured quickly and in large numbers, but since these ventilators are simply pumps that force air into the patient\u2019s lungs, they can only be used for patients under general anesthesia or those who are near death and have nonfunctional lungs. Applying such a device to a conscious patient would lead to a risk of death through barotrauma, which occurs when the human body is exposed to an inappropriate air pressure (Diaz and Heller 2020).",

These devices are currently being used in resuscitation units to treat COVID-19 (and other) patients, as these ventilators are intelligent enough to be able to discern if the patient wants to draw in air or push it out and then help the patient to achieve the desired action (Medtronic 2020a). A ventilator of this type has many sensors that interact with the human body, and air is supplied deliberately and accurately to the patient based on the sensor data. As an example, the Puritan Bennett 980 mechanical ventilator, which is a top of the line high-performance ventilator, provides advanced synchrony tools to help the clinician to set the ventilator to adapt to each patient\u2019s individual needs and thus provide the appropriate level of support throughout the breath (Medtronic 2020b). However, such devices are very complicated pieces of machinery, making them very expensive and time-consuming to manufacture in large quantities.",

Many enthusiastic engineers who want to help out are volunteering their expertise to develop a low-cost ventilator that could be built by any suitably adapted manufacturing facility (Pearce et al. 2020; Powers and Miller 2020). The vast majority of the solutions that have been proposed utilize a BVM and are based on a research paper from MIT released in 2010 (Al Husseini et al. 2010). An example is the automated manual resuscitator proposed by the MIT E-Vent Project Team (2020). However, some solutions\u2014such as the unique design we propose in the present paper\u2014are completely new ventilator designs. Various new concepts are circulating on the Internet, but many of them are based on a back and forth movement of the motor, which requires a relatively complex control system. In order to maximize the availability of ventilator devices (and minimize the complexity of their production), we believe that it is important to create a design based on unidirectional motion. Therefore, in this technical note, we propose a new, simple, easy-to-build ventilator design.",

The bottom circle then moves downwards under the influence of its own weight and the release of the tension in the wire, which is restored to its initial position. Since the pressure in the lungs is higher than the pressure in the air tank, the device will draw air from the patient's lungs. Thus, the OFF state corresponds to the expiration phase. The cycling of ON and OFF states induces respiration. On the other hand, the movement of the bendable wire towards its initial position causes the motor to rotate in the opposite direction, so the motor can be used as a dynamo to generate electricity, thus recharging the battery. This would make our solution less reliant on external power.",

More specifically, this work includes:Determining the optimal dimensions of the assembly, in particular the diameter of the disc and the height of the air tank according to the maximum air volume required.Determining the optimal diameter and material for the bendable wire, as well as the optimal number of wires.Choosing an adequate DC motor (torque, speed).When torque from the motor is applied to each wire, the distance between the fixed disc and the mobile disc depends on the bending stiffness of the wire. Changing the distance between the discs changes the air volume in the tank. Therefore, it is necessary to perform analytical calculations relating the torque to the wire parameters (e.g., number, diameter, Young modulus, and length).The friction between the upper disc and the support must be studied and optimized, as the fit between the upper disc and the support must be tight enough to stop any significant air leakage, but it must not be so tight that it slows down the motor and the ascent of the lower disc during the ON state.Adding precise and cost-effective sensors (to measure, e.g., the pressure, volume, and flow) that can provide information employed by the user to control and monitor the tidal volume, inspiratory pressure, bpm, and the inspiratory/expiratory ratio, thus maintaining patient safety and administering air deliberately and accurately.",
