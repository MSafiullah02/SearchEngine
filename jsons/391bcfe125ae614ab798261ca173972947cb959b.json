We hereby present the Viral Conceptual Model (VCM), centered on the virus sequence and described from four perspectives: biological (virus type and hosts/sample), analytical (annotations and variants), organizational (sequencing project) and technical (experimental technology). VCM is inspired by GCM, our previously developed Genomic Conceptual Model, but it introduces many novel concepts, as viral sequences significantly differ from human genomes. When applied to SARS-CoV2 virus, complex conceptual queries upon VCM are able to replicate the search results of recent articles, hence demonstrating huge potential in supporting virology research. In addition to VCM, we also illustrate the data dictionary for patient's phenotype used by the COVID-19 Host Genetic Initiative. Our effort is part of a broad vision: availability of conceptual models for both human genomics and viruses will provide important opportunities for research, especially if interconnected by the same human being, playing the role of virus host as well as provider of genomic and phenotype information.",

The sequence of the virus is the central information, along with its annotated parts (known genes, coding and untranslated regions...) and the nucleotides' variants with respect to the reference sequence for the specific species. Each sequence is identified by a strain name, which belongs to a specific virus species. Viruses have complex taxonomies, as they belong to genus, sub-families, and finally families (e.g., Coronaviridae). Other important aspects include the host organisms and isolation sources from which viral materials are extracted, the sequencing project, the scientific and medical publications related to the discovery of sequences; virus strains may be searched and compared intra-and cross-species. Luckily, all these data are made available publicly by various resources, from which they can be downloaded and re-distributed.",

The three main organizations providing open-source viral sequences are NCBI (US), DDBJ (Japan), and EMBL-EBI (Europe); they operate within the broader contexts provided by the International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration. 5 NCBI hosts the two, so far, most relevant viral sequence databases: Gen-Bank [35] contains the annotated collection of all publicly available DNA and RNA sequences; RefSeq [28] provides a stable reference for genome annotation, gene identification and characterization, and mutation/polymorphism analysis. GenBank is continuously updated thanks to the abundant sharing of multiple laboratories and data contributors around the world (note that SARS-CoV2 nucleotide sequences have increased from about 300 around the end of March 2020, to 1,624 as of April 27th).",

In this setting, we are coordinating the production of a data dictionary for the phenotype definition, which will be used as a reference by participating institutions, hosted by EGA [15] , the European Genome-phenome Archive of EMBL-EBI The dictionary, illustrated in Fig. 3 , contains patient phenotype information, collected at admission and during the course of hospitalizations (hosted by a given Hospital); each patient can be connected to a virus sequence (in that case, she is the host organism providing the HostSample of VCS) and can have multiple Encounters. For ease of visualization, attributes are clustered within Attribute Groups, indicated with white squares instead of black circles. Note that the dictionary representation deviates from a classic Entity-Relationship diagram as some attribute groups would typically deserve the role of entity; however, this simple format allows an easy mapping of the dictionary to questionnaires and an implementation by EGA in the form of spreadsheet. Attribute groups of patients describe: Demography&Exposure, RiskFactors, Comorbidities, AdmissionSymptoms, HospitalizationCourse; attribute groups of encounters describe: EncounterSymptoms, Treatments, LaboratoryResults. Attributes within groups can be further clustered within subgroups; for instance, Comorbidities include the subgroups ImmuneSystem, Respiratory, GenitoUrinary, CardioVascular, Neurological, Cancer.

            "text": "In addition to very general questions that can be easily asked through our conceptual model (e.g., retrieve all viruses with given characteristics), in the following we propose a list of interesting application studies that could be backed by the use of our conceptual model. In particular, they refer to SARS-CoV2 virus as it is receiving most of the attention of the scientific community. Fig. 4 represents the reference sequence of SARS-CoV2, 16 highlighting the major structural sub-sequences that are relevant for the encoding of proteins and other functions. It has 56 region Annotations, of which Fig. 4 represents only the 11 genes (ORF1ab, S, ORF3a, E, M, ORF6, ORF7a, ORF7b, ORF8, N, ORF10) plus the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase enzyme, with approximate indication of the corresponding coordinates. We next describe biological queries supported by VCM, from the easiest to the most complex ones, typically suggested by existing studies. Q1. The most common variants found in SARS-CoV2 sequences can be selected for US patients; the query can be performed only on specific genes. Country is in blue as samples will be distributed according to such field. Q3. According to [9] , E and RdRp genes are highly mutated and thus crucial in diagnosing COVID-19 disease; first-line screening tools of 2019-nCoV should perform an E gene assay, followed by confirmatory testing with the RdRp gene assay. Conceptual queries are concerned with retrieving all sequences with mutations within genes E or RdRp and relating them to given hosts, e.g. humans affected in China. Q4. Tang et al. [41] claim that there are two clearly definable \"major types\" (S and L) of SARS-CoV2 in this outbreak, that can be differentiated by transmission rates. Intriguingly, the S and L types can be clearly distinguished by just two tightly linked SNPs at positions 8,782 (within the ORF1ab gene from C to T) and 28,144 (within ORF8 from T to C). Then, queries can correlate these SNPs to other variants or the outbreak of COVID-19 in specific countries (e.g., [16] ). Q5. To inform SARS-CoV2 vaccine design efforts, it may be needed to track antigenic diversity. Typically, pathogen genetic diversity is categorised into distinct clades (i.e., a monophyletic group on a phylogenetic tree). These clades may refer to 'subtypes', 'genotypes', or 'groups', depending on the taxonomic level under investigation. In [16] , specific sequence variants are used to define clades/haplogroups (e.g., the A group is characterized by the 20,229 and 13,064 nucleotides, originally C mutated to T, by the 18,483 nucleotide T mutated to C, and by the 8,017, from A to G). VCM supports all the information required to replicate the definition of SARS-CoV2 clades requested in the study. Fig. 6 illustrates the conjunctive selection of sequences with all four variants corresponding to the A clade group defined in [16] and the resulting retrieved sequences. Q6. Morais Junior at al. [21] propose a subdivision of the global SARS-CoV2 population into sixteen subtypes, defined using \"widely shared polymorphisms\" identified in nonstructural (nsp3, nsp4, nsp6, 27 nsp12, nsp13 and nsp14) cistrons, structural (spike and nucleocapsid), and accessory (ORF8) genes. VCM supports all the information required to replicate the definition of such subtypes.",

Even more interesting queries will be enabled by combining phenotypes with virus sequences; along this direction, we also contributed to the data dictionary effort (Fig. 3) . When both datasets will be accessible, other more powerful studies will be possible. Some early findings have been already published connecting virus sequences with phenotypes, so far with very small datasets (e.g., [22] with only 5 patients, [24] with 9 patients, and [41] with 103 sequenced SARS-CoV2 genomes). As reaffirmed by these works, there is need for additional comprehensive studies linking the viral sequences of SARS-CoV2 to the phenotype of patients affected by COVID-19.

Whereas, a user working on vaccine development could be interested in what are the epitopes (i.e., antigen parts to which antibodies attach) that cover the whole database or a partition of it, for MHC types prevalent in different infected humans.
