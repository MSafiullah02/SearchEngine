Among the viruses that belong to Coronaviridae family and pathogenic to human beings, the SARS-CoV-2 has been identified as the third virus after SARS-CoV and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome associated coronavirus (MERS-CoV) to create a pandemic situation [3]. The SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the family Coronaviridae. Genealogical examination of the SARS-CoV-2 revealed that it belongs to the genera beta coronavirus and exhibited 96% homology sequence similarity with Bat SL-CoV; whereas, the bat is an intermediate host or not needs to be elucidated [2]. The diameter of SARS-CoV-2 ranges between 50 and 200 nm [4].",

The outermost layer consists of glycoprotein spikes followed by an envelope, a membrane, and a nucleocapsid layer towards the inner side. The nucleocapsid layer holds the viral genome, RNA. The nucleocapsid layer, envelope, and the spike membrane provide a protective layer for the viral genome [5]. The RNA of CoVs is a single-stranded positive-sense RNA (+ssRNA), which is ~30 kb possessing 5\u2032-cap and 3\u2032-poly-A tail [6]. After entering the host cell, the SARS-CoV-2 undergoes replication by using the host's machinery and synthesizes N, M, E, and S structural proteins. The negative strand of the RNA genome is produced using a positive-strand as a template. At the time of the process of replication in the host cell, the M protein attaches to the membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum, and the N protein binds to the genome. Nsp proteins help the RNA to assemble into a helical structure which enters the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum. The viral progenies produced undergo exocytosis and enter the extracellular space [7].",

The symptoms of COVID-19 include infection to the lower respiratory tract, pneumonia ranging from mild to severe, dry cough, lymphopenia, fever, and fatigue [6,8]. Upon mild infection, the patients present dry cough, vomiting, diarrhea, fatigue, and fever as symptoms whereas in case of severe infection, one week later the disease onset the condition of the patient may worsen resulting in hypoxemia, septic shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), metabolic diseases and may also lead to death in some cases [9]. Apart from the epidemic condition created by the coronavirus, it has been found that the affected individuals, along with other comorbidities such as cardiovascular diseases, type 1 and type II diabetes, and renal diseases, are found to be severely ill compared to the individuals infected only by the coronavirus. The controversy has been raised when Lei Fang, a postdoctoral researcher, and his colleagues suggested that \u201cPatients with cardiac diseases, hypertension or diabetes who are treated with ACE2-increasing drugs are at higher risk for severe COVID-19 infection and, therefore, should be monitored for ACE2-modulating medications, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blockers\u201d [10].",

This enzyme's function is to degrade the angiotensin II peptide, which acts as a vasoconstrictor [13]. Therefore, the ACE2 enzyme is considered to be a potential vasodilator. The SARS-CoV-2 virus binds with the ACE-2 receptor, which mediates the virus's entry into the host cells [14] via the plasma membrane or endocytosis through the release of proteases [2]. The activated immune cells secrete chemokines and inflammatory cytokines into the endothelial cells of pulmonary arteries [15]. The angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) is required to convert angiotensin I to angiotensin II [16]. The angiotensin II produced results in vasoconstriction upon the activation of angiotensin II receptors due to which there is an increase in blood pressure [17,18]. Therefore, ACEi and ARBs are used as anti-hypertensive treatment options [18] (Fig. 1\n).",

The focal hemorrhagic condition was observed in the kidneys of the patients infected by SARS [35] (represented in Table 1). In a study that was conducted among 536 patients infected with SARS, 6.7% of the affected individuals exhibited acute renal impairment 20 days after the infection. Most of the people who died were infected with SARS and had renal impairment than those without renal impairment. Acute renal impairment resulted in the disturbance of pre-renal factors, thereby resulting in multi-organ failure. Age and acute respiratory distress syndrome were the two risk factors determining the progression of acute renal impairment in SARS affected individuals [36].",

Also, the degree of hepatic damage depends on the severity of the disease [[37], [38], [39], [40], [41], [42]]. The ACE2 receptor, which is responsible for the SARS-CoV entry, is widely distributed on the hepatic tissue's endothelial cells. The existence of the viral genome in the vascular endothelial cells and parenchymal cells indicates that SARS-CoV infects the lungs and other organs. The presence of viral load in the hepatic cells was confirmed using RT-PCR technique [12,14,37,43]. Also, the SARS-CoV specific protein 7a has shown to be responsible for causing apoptosis not only in the lungs but also in the other organs, including the liver through the caspase-dependent pathway, thereby resulting in liver injury [44].",

These conditions act to decline the innate immune system of the host, thereby the inability of the host to fight against the pathogenesis of MERS-CoV. A study conducted on 637 MERS-CoV patients revealed that 15% of them have diabetes, 16% of them are obese, 50% of them had hypertension, and 30% are predisposed to cardiovascular diseases [65]. A 57-year-old diabetic and the hypertensive patient exhibited myocardial ischemia besides edema in the pulmonary tract, elevated troponin levels which returned to normal after 48 h, a chronic severe 3-vessel disease with no acute vessel closure characterized by coronary angiography. Later, he didn't respond and became hypotensive with facial paralysis on the left side [66].",

The MERS-CoV enters the host cell through the DPP-4 receptor and spreads the infection [70]. The liver is the main organ that expresses high levels of Dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) [71]. This was experimentally proved by infecting the transgenic mice expressing hDPP4 with MERS-CoV which indicated that the liver injury had taken place on the 5th day of the infection as evidenced by the pathological manifestations such as disintegrated death of hepatocytes in the hepatic sinus, penetration of large amounts of activated macrophages and Kupffer cells. The changes related to fat metabolism were observed on the 9th day of infection, and the liver cell necrosis was quite less [72] (represented in Table 1).",

Also, out of the 111 patients, only 10.8% of the patients exhibited a slight increase in creatine or blood urea nitrogen levels, and 7.2% of the patients had shown a minute raise in the albuminuria levels. None of the patients out of 111 didn't exhibit any acute kidney injury (AKI) after the COVID-19 infection. The remaining five patients who were already undergoing continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) also didn't show any fatal effects after COVID-19 infection confirmed by diagnosing the renal indicators [99]. Out of 701 patients, 2% of the patients were found to have CKD, and the average lymphocytic number was found to be reduced than the normal. High sensitivity C-reactive protein levels were significantly increased. In patients reported with high levels of serum, creatine indicated high levels of serum lactose dehydrogenase. Among hospitalized patients, patients with high levels of serum creatine were mostly old and male sex. Also, they exhibited lower platelet and lymphocytic count and elevated leukocytic count. The patients with elevated procalcitonin also exhibited elevated levels of aspartate aminotransferase and lactate dehydrogenase. Acute kidney injury was significantly higher in those patients with high serum creatine levels. AKI eventually results in mortality [100] (represented in Table 1). Therefore, advanced identification of kidney diseases in patients affected by COVID-19 may help the clinicians to reduce the mortality rate due to comorbidities such as chronic kidney disease, acute kidney injury, proteinuria, and hematuria.",

In addition to the type 2 cells in the lungs, both the bile duct cells and hepatocytes also express ACE2, which might be the reason that liver injury occurs during SARS-CoV-2 infection [103]. The bile duct epithelial cells are involved in immune responses and the regeneration of the hepatocytes [104]. Besides possessing a high number of ACE2 on its surface, bile duct cells are more prone to the SARS-CoV-2 infection resulting in liver injury, which indicates that the hepatocytes are not directly involved in the hepatic injury [37]. The histopathological manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients revealed mild lobular and portal activity and restrained microvascular steatosis [105]. The degree of liver damage is directly proportional to the severity of the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Still, the reason for the liver injury remains elusive. A recent study reported that the use of anti-viral medication lopinavir might result in hepatic damage [102]. Therefore, whether the liver injury is due to the virus entry or due to the drugs used as anti-viral medication needs to be elucidated.",

Out of 70 COVID-19 pneumonia patients, 66 patients have lung damage in a different manner, which was determined by CT. This damage is in a diverse range; in the alveoli, there is a hardened tissue with the dense clumps which block the vessels in the tiny air sacs, which absorb the oxygen and cause tissue lesions. This tissue lesion acts as a sign of the long-term lung disease. Similar reports have been found in both the SARS CoV and MERS. The patients admitted with lung pneumonia shows damage in both the lungs. The CT scan of the COVID-19 patients indicates that there is a tissue lesion found over the alveoli and which can develop into the scars.

The virus enters the medullary neurons during the latency phase. A possible mechanism explained was that the SARS-CoV-2 might enter the olfactory lobe of the brain through nasal chambers upon inhalation and may lead to inflammation and demyelination. Later, it spreads to the whole brain due to its ability to cross the blood-brain barrier. Some neurological symptoms exhibited by the COVID-19 infection patients include nausea, vomiting, and headache (represented in Table 1). Since the SARS-CoV-2 possess the ability to cross the blood-brain barrier, it is important to design the drugs in such a way that they can cross the blood-brain barrier and scavenges the brain from viral infection. Also, it is essential to note that the respiratory illness accompanies neurological invasion by the virus, therapeutic care must be taken to prevent the viral entry into the central nervous system (CNS) [7].",

Upon viral infection, there is an immune response. T cells, especially the cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4+) and a group of differentiation 8 (CD8+), have an anti-viral role. CD8+ T cells are highly cytotoxic, and they killed infected cells. This T cell induces the pro-inflammatory cytokines through nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-kB) signaling. This process further activates the cytokines and chemokines [7]. Similar to SARS-CoV, MERS, SARS-CoV-2 infection in the immune effector cells are also having the enhanced level of the cytokines such as IFN-\u03b3, IFN-\u03b1, IL-6, IL-1\u03b2, IL-18, IL-12, TGF\u03b2, IL-33 and TNF-\u03b1 and chemokines such as CCL2, CCL5, CCL3, CXCL10, CXCL9, and CXCL8.

            "text": "On the other hand, the T-cells are having four types of it, such as Th1, Th2, Th17 (inflammatory), and anti-inflammatory Tregs. These Th2 cells generate IL-4 cells. The compound which can block the Th1 (Boost immune system) tends to augments the level of the Th2 (anti-inflammatory response). IL-4 triggers the Th2 cells and obstructs the Th1 response. This Th2 helps to repair form tissue dysfunction and another type of malfunction. It is found to be good that the increased level of the Th1 and Th17 plays an important role in hyperactive immune response and during autoimmune conditions. It is showed that there is an induction of the Th1/Th17 and the production of antibodies upon COVID-19 condition [110]. Contradict to this; the patient has a high level of Th2 in need of intensive care [111]. During the MERS condition, there is a reduced level of both the Th1 and Th2, which further enhances the inflammatory cytokines and causes more infection and death [112]. SARS patients who died with an older age have higher cytokines of Th2, such as IL-4, IL-10, and IL-5 [113]. This incidence supports the increased Th2 level of COVID-19 patients who needs intensive care. The mechanism behind this is based on the molecular weight of the protein of SARS-CoV2; the activity of the immune system is changed. The recent research by the F. Javier Mart\u00edn Oncina in 2020 showed that based on the antigen molecular weight, the host's immune response is varied. The proteins of the SARS-CoV2 are spike protein with 140 kDa, Envelope protein with 10 kDa, Membrane protein with 25 kDa, and nucleocapsid protein with 50 kDa. The protein with more than >70 kDa, such as spike protein, cannot be arrested by the B-cell, thereby it activates the inflammatory response through the Th1 response with the macrophages. This process occurs in the subcapsular sinus and through dendritic cells phagocytosis. The other proteins with <70 kDa are found in the protein of SARS-CoV2, which activates the receptor of B-cell and stimulates Th2 immune response. The unremittingviral particle overload, which is unrestricted by the viral cell lysing, will be terminated by the Th1 (pro-inflammatory response). Further, it increases the protein level with a weight of <70 kDa stimulates the B cells in large amounts. This induction of the B-cells leads to the condition called as Activated Induced Cell Death (AICD), which speediness the apoptosis and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines cause lymphopenia, thereby it produces IL-10, augments the shift of Th2 form Th1 response which causes further suppression of immune system, COVID-19 sepsis [114]. Correlative to that that COVID-19 patients with the high level of Th2 immune response need intensive care [111], which shows that they might be having apoptosis, lymphopenia, and suppression of immune system further causes COVID-19 sepsis [114]. Though the cell death is via Th2 immune response but the level of IL-4 is not elucidated yet. The role of IL-4 and its mechanism behind COVID-19 remain elusive (Represented in Fig. 2\n).",

Whereas, in old age people other than reduced ACE2 levels, other co-morbid conditions such as cardiovascular problems, diabetes, and hypertension might be present. The medication prescribed for these patients helps in elevating the ACE2 levels, which might enhance the viral entry. Though the treatment reduces the co-morbid severities, the viral infection is enhanced in those patients. Therefore, it is conclusive that young patients, even though they are more susceptible to the COVID-19 infection, they are less severely affected and exhibit elevated angiotensin II signaling. Whereas, the older patients who exhibit low levels of ACE2 and higher angiotensin II signaling leads to hypertension. The usage of ACEi and ARBs help in promoting the vasodilatory effects by elevating the ACE2 levels, thereby becoming susceptible to COVID-19 infection and are severely affected [130].",

Therefore, inhibiting the pro-inflammatory candidates might be a potential therapeutic option to treat COVID-19 [148]. Anti-TNF therapy was approved and has been utilized for 20 years as a promising option to treat autoimmune diseases such as ankylosing spondylitis, rheumatoid arthritis, and inflammatory bowel disease [149]. TNF is the key enhancer of inflammation and also present in the blood of COVID-19 severely affected patients [150]. Therefore, prescribing anti-TNF therapy may help to prevent the aggression of the infection. It has been reported that patients with inflammatory bowel disease contracted with COVID-19. One hundred sixteen patients were on anti-TNF therapy, of whom 99 recovered, and only one patient died. Therefore, the usage of anti-TNF therapy may stand as a promising therapy to prevent the progression of the viral infection by inhibiting the key pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF [148].",

Besides serving as an entry point for SARS-CoV-2, the higher levels of ACE2 are required by the hypertension patient to reduce the blood pressure. Therefore, the ACE2 levels need to be maintained besides inhibiting the entry of SARS-CoV-2. Thus, the usage of human recombinant soluble ACE2 (hrsACE2) which exhibited positive results in the phase I and phased II clinical trials to elevate the soluble form of ACE2that competes with the membranous ACE2 for binding with SARS-CoV-2 and inhibits the viral entry and replication can be considered as a therapeutic option to treat COVID-19.

This COVID-19 is highly associated with the comorbidities and multi-organ injuries [158], so, in this review, we focused on the COVID-19 associated with the risk factors of a different diseased condition. Also, we have given the multi-organ injuries and comorbidities in the SARS-CoV and MERS, which was helpful for the prediction of COVID-19 associated diseased conditions. In this review, we have given the comorbidities risk with the COVID-19 and multi-organ injuries along with the symptoms such as cardiovascular risk through the deregulation of ACE2 with the symptom of hypertension and vasodilation. COVID-19 associated gastrointestinal risks are with the symptoms of vomiting, nausea, and diarrhea. Kidney risk associated with COVID-19 is with the symptoms of proteinuria, hematuria, increased albumin, increased level of creatinine, BUN, procalcitonin, aspartate aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase leads to chronic kidney disease. Along with that, it is connected with diabetes mellitus with a high sugar level. It has a high level of liver injury, determined through the elevated level of the AST, ALT, GGT, and bilirubin. It has a high level of lung injury with the symptoms of chest tightness, wheezing, and dry cough. It is related to the elevated CNS risk through SARS-CoV-2 enters into the olfactory lobe of the brain via a nasal chamber, further causes inflammation and demyelination. It is connected with the ocular risk with the chemosis, epiphora, conjunctivitis, and conjunctival hyperemia with an increased level of neutrophilic, lymphocytic counts, procalcitonin, and C-reactive protein. It also has a high risk of lung cancer risk, tuberculosis, venous thromboembolism via an increased level of bleeding.

Then it undergoes the process of the proteolytic cleavage; further, it will undergo replication and lead to the formation of the proteins. This process activates the signaling pathway, such as the NF-kB pathway, via TRIF. The interaction between the cells and the virus activates many cytokine storms. On the other hand, once the virus enters into the cell, the antigen present in that would undergo the antigen presentation cells (APC); further, this stimulates the humoral and cellular immunity. COVID-19 infects the macrophage cells, which presents to the T cell, further, which leads to the activation, differentiation of T-cells, along with the production of cytokines. This shows the negative action on the activation of CD8 T cells. Thus the mediator produced by the CD8+ T cells clears the infection of SARS-CoV. Upon COVID-19 infection, there is a reduced CD4+ and CD8+ cell level, further increasing the cytokine level in the cells, which triggers the inflammation. This mediates the production of the cytokine storm via secreting chemokine and cytokines such as IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, IL-8, IL-21, CCL2, CCL3, CCL5, CXCL10, TNF-\u03b2, and MCP-1 and triggers the tissue injury. On the other hand, based on the weight of the protein of SARS-CoV2, there is an activation of Th1/Th17 (boosts immune system) when the spike protein is >70 kDa. In case of the Th2 (anti-inflammatory) is activated by the majority of the protein with <70 kDa, then the activation of the B-cell receptor, which causes activation-induced cell death such as apoptosis and lymphopenia which is by releasing IL-10, shifting of Th1 to Th2 immune response, suppression of the immune system and further leads to the COVID-19 sepsis. The role of IL-4 has not been elucidated yet. It remains unanswerable upon COVID-19 condition with the mechanism of Th2 and Th1/Th17.",

The symptoms found SARS-CoV-2 in normal patients and patients with other co-morbid conditions. The typical symptoms that emerged due to SARS-CoV-2 include dry cough, sneezing, and difficulty in breathing, which eventually leads to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). The severity of the SARS not only depends upon the person's age and immunity but also various other co-morbid conditions such as cardiac issues, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, tuberculosis, cancer, and venous thromboembolism. The pre-existing co-morbid conditions deteriorate the patient health upon SARS-CoV-2 entry. Also, the SARS-CoV-2 have different effects on different organs which include elevated troponin levels in the cardiac tissue, acute kidney injury, proteinuria and hematuria in the kidney, elevated ALT, AST levels indicating liver damage, conjunctivitis and conjunctival hyperemia in the eye, the intrauterine transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 from mother to the fetus, vomiting, and diarrhea.",
