The reported epidemic dynamic in Wenzhou was comparable to the country-wide study performed by the national novel coronavirus pneumonia emergency response epidemiology team [2] . However, we believe that some of the implications may need rethinking. First, we question the level of synchrony of COVID-19 epidemics between Wenzhou and the three neighboring cities of Wuhan the epicenter ( Figure 1 ). The numbers of confirmed COVID-19 cases in cities were positively correlated to the emigration number from Wuhan [3] . Big data analysis revealed that Xiaogan, Huanggang and Jingzhou were the three cities of the largest influx of Wuhan passengers during Jan 10 th -23 rd , 2020, with approximately 690,000, 650,000 and 330,000 people respectively (according to online real-time map of migration at http://qianxi.baidu.com/), while Wenzhou had around 90,000 individuals returning from Wuhan. Moreover, although the symptom onset date of the first confirmed COVID-19 patient was Dec 1, 2019, the diagnostic PCR method was not established until Jan 10 th , 2020 [4] . The epidemic A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t curves demonstrated in the article were constructed with dates of diagnosis report rather than symptom onset. In fact, the onset time of the outbreak in the three cities near Wuhan might be much earlier than that in Wenzhou.",

The clinically diagnosed cases in Hubei province, but not applicable to the rest of the country, were regarded as confirmed cases if they fulfilled one epidemiological clue and had pneumonia-related computerized tomography (CT) scan results.
