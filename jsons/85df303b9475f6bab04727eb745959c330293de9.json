In this paper, we develop a model that tries to explain and describe the temperature and relative humidity sensitivity of respiratory droplets and their possible connection in determining viral outbreaks. The model has two parts. First, we model the growth rate of the infected population based on a reaction mechanism -the final equations of which are similar to the well-known SIR model. The advantage of modeling the pandemic using the reaction mechanism is that the rate constants have sound physical interpretation. The infection rate constant is derived using collision rate * theory and shown to be a function of the respiratory droplet lifetime. In the second part, we have emulated the respiratory droplets responsible for disease transmission as salt solution droplets and computed their evaporation time accounting for droplet cooling, heat and mass transfer and finally crystallization of the salt. The model output favourably compares with the experimentally obtained evaporation characteristics of levitated droplets of pure water and salt solution, respectively, ensuring fidelity of the model. Droplet evaporation/desiccation time is indeed dependent on ambient temperature and relative humidity, considered at both outdoor and indoor conditions.",

The ongoing Covid-19 pandemic has led to the debate whether temperature and relative humidity have influenced the growth rate of the pandemic in specific geographical locations. The debate has been bolstered by the observation that higher growth rates in localized outbreaks are often associated with higher latitudes and times corresponding to the transition from winter to spring. Wang et al. [5] concluded that high temperature and high relative humidity reduced the effective reproductive number of the outbreak -a result they claimed to be consistent with the past outbreaks of influenza and SARS. However, Yao et al. [6] found that ambient conditions like temperature do not hold any significant influence on the growth rate of the pandemic. A recent report by the United States National Academies [7] and references of recent experiments therein show that laboratory evidence from multiple sources suggest reduced survivability of the Covid-19 virus at high temperature and relative humidity. A review of recent literature focusing on establishing effect of temperature and humidity has been conducted in [8] . Screening 517 articles the authors found that the general consensus is cold and dry conditions were suitable for the spread of the virus. To our knowledge the reason for this behavior is not well established.",

            "text": "It has been however well established that Covid-19 transmits via respiratory droplets that are exhaled during breathing, talking, coughing or sneezing. Different activities correspond to different droplet sizes and myriad trajectories for the droplets embedded in the corresponding jets. These respiratory droplets are essentially salt solution droplets with salt mass fraction of about 0.01, in addition to proteins and pathogens, when the droplets emerge from an infected individual [9, 10] . In this paper, to model the outbreaks, we extensively use the evaporation and settling times of NaCl-water droplets which are in turn used as a surrogate model of the infectious droplets. The evaporation mechanism of such droplets is laced with complexities stemming from initial droplet cooling, heat transfer, mass transfer of the solvent and solute, respectively, and finally crystallization of the solute -a phenomenon known as efflorescence. The model developed is first validated with new experimental results obtained from droplets observed to evaporate in an acoustic levitator. Simultaneously, a chemical kinetics based reaction mechanism model is developed with final rate equations similar to that yielded by the SIR model [11] . The rate constant is shown to be a strong function of the droplet lifetime. Next, the droplet lifetime at two typical locations relevant to the ongoing pandemic is evaluated. At these locations, both outdoor and indoor conditions are considered. Combining all, we find that the model yields encouraging results in at least partially explaining the significantly different growth rate of the outbreak at the two geographical locations exhibiting very different weather conditions. The results in no way suggests that variables not considered in this paper play a secondary role in determining the outbreak spread. Rather, this paper aims to establish a possible connection between the pandemic and the ambient conditions using a well defined framework rooted in physical sciences. The paper is arranged as follows: first we provide details of the experiments used to obtain the evaporation characteristics of the water and salt solution droplets. This is followed by the reaction mechanism model that yields the equations for the growth rate and the infection rate constant of the outbreaks. This infection rate constant provides the connection and motivation for modeling the droplet evaporation time scales. Next, to evaluate the rate constant, detailed modeling of the droplet evaporation is presented. This is followed by results and discussions. Finally, we summarize the approach and findings in the conclusion section.",

The experimental setup with the diagnostics is shown in Fig. 1 . A droplet was generated and positioned near one of the stable nodes of the levitator by using a micropipette. The levitated droplet was allowed to evaporate in the ambient condition of the lab at 30 o C and at about 50% RH. The transient dynamics of evaporation and precipitation of the evaporating droplet was captured with shadowgraphy technique using combination of a CCD camera (NR3S1, IDT Vision) fitted with a Navitar zoom lens assembly (6.5x lens and 5x extension tube) and a backlit-illumination by a cold LED light source (SL150, Karl Storz). A set of 10 images at a burst speed of 30 frames per second is acquired every 2 seconds for the entire duration of the droplet lifetime. The spatial resolution of the images was \u2248 1\u00b5m/pixel. The temporal evolution of diameter of the evaporating droplet was extracted from the images using the \"Analyze Particles\" plugin in ImageJ (open source platform for image processing). The final precipitate was carefully collected on carbon tape and observed in dark-field mode under a reflecting microscope (Olympus BX-51). A range of initial droplet diameters varying from 300\u00b5m to 1000\u00b5m were investigated in experiments.",

Thus, we assume that a conical volume in front of P is surrounded by a cloud of infectious droplets exhaled by P . The droplet cloud is denoted by D and the maximum cloud diameter is given by \u03c3 D . Clearly \u03c3 D should be determined by the smaller of the evaporation or settling time of the droplets ejected by P and the horizontal component of the velocity with which the droplets displace.

The droplet evaporation physics is complicated by the presence of non-volatile salts (predominantly NaCl) as present in our saliva [9] .

In reality, during coughing, talking or sneezing, the droplets are exhaled in a turbulent puff [20] . However, as shown in Eqn. 11, the puff rapidly decelerates due to entrainment and lack of sustained momentum source, rendering the average V D,P to be less than 1% of the initial velocity. Furthermore, since Prandtl number P r = \u03bd/\u03b1 = 0.71 for air, we can safely assume that the temperature and relative humidity that the droplets in the puff experiences are on average very close to that of the ambient. At the initial stages, the puff will indeed be slightly affected by buoyancy, which will influence droplet cooling and evaporation dynamics. Quantifying these effects accurately, merit separate studies, see for e.g. [21] for buoyant clouds. In a higher dimensional model these could be incorporated. In any case, the evaporation rate of the droplet is driven by the transport of water vapor from the droplet surface to the ambient far field.

The internal energy of the droplet undergoes variation primarily due to evaporative mass loss and sensible enthalpy change, resulting in change in its temperature. The evaporation is driven by the vapor concentration gradient from the droplet surface to the far field. The partial pressure of water vapor at the droplet surface is determined by the surface temperature and solvent (water) mole-fraction at the droplet surface, while its surface temperature T s is determined by Eqn. 15. The far field vapor concentration, on the other hand, is ascertained by the ambient condition, (temperature and relative humidity, RH), which in the case of Covid-19 corresponds to specific geographical locations. It is obvious that for lower ambient temperatures, i.e. T s,0 > T \u221e , the droplet should undergo rapid cooling from its initial value. The droplet temperature, however, should eventually reach a steady state limit (wet bulb). This limit is such that the droplet surface temperature will be always lower than the ambient, implying a positive temperature gradient or heat input. The heat subsequently transferred from the ambient to the droplet surface after attaining wet bulb limit is used completely for evaporating the drop without any change in sensible enthalpy.

            "text": "To validate the model, few targeted experiments were conducted to observe isolated levitated droplets evaporating in a fixed ambient condition. Particularly, the droplets with (1% w/w) NaCl solution vaporized to shrink to 30% of its initial diameter during the first stage of evaporation as shown in Fig. 3 . Hereafter, a plateau-like stage is approached due to increased solute accumulation near the droplet's surface, which inhibits the diameter from shrinking rapidly. However, as shown in Fig. 3 shrinkage does occur (till D s /D s,0 \u2248 0.2), as the droplet undergoes a sol-gel transformation. The final shape of the precipitate is better observed from the micrographs presented in Fig. 3 . Thus the salt crystallizes reducing its concentration and increasing P vap (T s , \u03c7 1,s ) such that evaporation and water mass loss can proceed until nearly all the water has evaporated and only a piece of solid crystal as shown in Fig. 3 is left. It can be observed from Fig. 3 that in all cases, the final evaporation time is predicted within 15% of the experimental values. This suggests that despite the model being devoid of complexities associated with inhomogeneities of temperature and solute mass fraction within the droplet and simple one step reaction to model the crystallization kinetics, the model demonstrates reasonably good predictive capability. It is prudent to mention again, that although we have done the analysis for single isolated droplet, in reality coughing or sneezing involves a whole gamut of droplet sizes in the form of a cloud. However, based on the droplet size distribution during coughing and sneezing [26] , one can show that the total volume of the respiratory droplets is a negligible fraction (O(10 \u22125 )) of the volume that an individual exhales during breathing or coughing [20] . This ensures that the droplets are well dispersed and the gas is sufficiently dilute. In other words, the dilute limit dictates that each droplet in that exhaled volume may not be influenced by the other droplets in the vicinity. This further justifies the efficacy of the current model based on an isolated droplet.",

In this paper we have presented a model for the early phases of Covid-19 outbreak as a function of ambient temperature and relative humidity, at both outdoor and indoor conditions. The model and its inter-dependencies on the different physical principles/sub-models is summarized in Fig. 7 . It must be recognized that the model assumes conditions where transmission occurs solely due to inhalation of infected respiratory droplets alongside many other simplifying assumptions. After being ejected, smaller droplets attain the wet bulb temperature corresponding to the local ambience, and begins to evaporate. However, due to presence of dissolved salt the evaporation stops when the size of the droplet reaches about 20-30% of the initial diameter. But now, the droplet salt concentration has increased to levels that trigger onset of crystallization. The evaporation time of the salt solution droplet is a however a complex manifestation of the intricate interplay between several physico-chemical phenomena: droplet cooling, evaporation, increasing salt concentration leading to crystal-lization. Of course, the entire process competes with settling -the process by which larger droplets fall away before they can evaporate. The smaller of the two: evaporation time and settling time thus dictates droplet lifetime \u03c4 . In any case, the infection rate constant derived using collision theory of reaction rates, is shown to be a function of the respiratory droplet lifetime (\u03c4 ). Since the infected population size depends almost exponentially on this rate constant, the model finds that given similar relative humidity between two places, infection spreads more rapidly in lower temperature conditions than in their warmer counterparts.
