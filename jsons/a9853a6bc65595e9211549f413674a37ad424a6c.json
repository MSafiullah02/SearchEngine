This strain (Arg320) was detected by the EIA developed against recombinant Mexico virus (rMxV) capsids, but the viral RNA polymerase sequence was closer to Lordsdale virus, in a separate genetic cluster of Norwalk-like viruses. A 3.3 kb cDNA from the RNA polymerase region to the 3 end of the genome of Arg320 was cloned and sequenced. The sequence demonstrated that the capsid region of Arg320 shared 95% amino acid identity with MxV, but 68% identity with Lordsdale virus, while the RNA polymerase region shared 95% identity with Lordsdale virus, but 87% identity with MxV. Pair-wise sequence comparisons identified a potential recombination site at the polymerase/capsid junction. This is the first example of a naturally occurring recombinant in the CV family. Further studies to search for and characterize other strains may be necessary for understanding the genetic diversity of the family.",

The viral RNA polymerase gene shares closest sequence with one HuCV strain but its capsid gene shares closest sequence identity with another HuCV strain. Spontaneous point mutation would not result in such sequence changes between two regions next to each other in a genome. The cDNA used to obtain the sequence was generated from one RT-PCR reaction covering the entire region. Therefore, the cDNA was from a single virus, not from multiple viruses due to contamination or dual infection of the child. The sequences of both ends of the cDNA were confirmed by simultaneously sequencing of purified cDNA from a single bacterial colony, excluding the possibility of contamination during the sequencing. Finally, the two potential parental strains are in the range of genetic diversity among strains currently co-circulating [4, 20, 24, 25] , therefore, the recombination event could have occurred recently, but not necessarily during the infection of this child.",

When MeV was compared with MxV and a Japanese strain, Oth-25, there seemed no significant difference of sequence identities between the capsid and RNA polymerase regions.

The high sequence conservation in the ORF1/capsid junction among the two strains representing the putative parent strains and the putative recombinant suggests the recombination might be driven by homologous RNA interaction. The \"copy choice\" model of RNA recombination has been preferred for singlestranded RNA viruses, including picornaviruses and coronaviruses [2, 13, 17, 18, 21, 23] . Co-infection of different HuCV strains in one patient has been observed in our surveillance of HuCV-associated outbreaks of acute gastroenteritis in Virginia [12] and mixed infection of multiple strains in one outbreak has been reported [5] . Therefore, high sequence conservation would increase the interaction between RNA molecules from different strains and recombination could occur as a result of such homologous interaction. In the copy-choice model, recombination could occur during RNA replication with the involvement of viral RNA polymerase, which may switch templates of two different strains at the highly conserved region of the gemomes of the two strains.",

It remains unclear how CV subgenomic RNA is involved in virus replication, but it is clear that both CV genomic and subgenomic RNAs share highly conserved 5 end sequence and both RNAs are assembled into virions. The high conserved 5 end of the subgenomic RNAs between MxV and Lordsdale virus also is included in the highly conserved ORF1/capsid region. Therefore, interaction between genomic and subgenomic RNAs could occur by the same mechanisms as that of genomic-genomic interaction, which would significantly increase the chance of recombination events that otherwise result only from genomic-genomic RNA interaction. Furthermore, because both genomic and subgenomic RNA are assembled into virions, co-infection of different strains may result in reassortment of different genomic RNAs from different strains, as found in the influenza virus [26] , which could result in recombination in future generations, although direct evidence of reassortment of CV RNAs remains lacking.",

Furthermore, because the putative recombination event may be predicted to have occurred in this part, the sequences at both sides of the recombination site of the progeny strain may have changed since the recombination event due to naturally occurring point mutations. The parent strains also would have changed due to the same mechanism. Thus, we may never observe 100% sequence identity of corresponding regions that would identify the parent strains. Because the potential recombination event described in this paper may have occurred recently, the sequences adjoining the potential recombination site maintained a high level of identity, which allowed us to identify the recombinant. It would not be difficult to imagine many CV strains that currently are circulating could have derived from recombination events in the remote past. The existence of a recombinant within the CV family also provides understanding of the relationship between picornaviruses and caliciviruses which belong to a superfamily [22] that probably was divided into two families by recombination.",

If the RNA recombination described in this study is a common phenomenon, we would see more diversity of the family, which would make genotyping more difficult. For example, many reports on CV genotyping have been based upon sequences of the RNA polymerase region, due to its relatively high sequence conservation and ease of designing PCR primers. In comparison, only a few capsid genes have been characterized. The viral capsid protein is responsible for antigenicity and possibly protective immunity. Genotying of CVs based upon the RNA polymerase sequences clearly is not the best choice if ORF1/capsid gene recombination is common.

These findings indicate that such recombinants are genetically stable, are still circulating, cause illness, and possibly have a wide distribution. The fact that strains similar to both putative parents of the recombinant are currently co-circulating not only allowed us to identify the recombinant, but also provide indirect evidence that natural recombination is still occurring. In another words, if the parental strains had less survival advantage than the recombinant and the recombination event occurred long ago, we would not be able to recognize the recombinant because representatives of the parental genetic clusters would no longer exist. Therefore, molecular recombination could markedly increase the genetic diversity of currently circulating strains in the CV family.",
