An important unresolved issue is the design of search interfaces: for wide adoption, they must be engaging and easy-to-use, particularly for nonexperts. The MathSeer interface addresses this with straightforward formula creation, editing, and lookup. Formulas are stored in 'chips' created using handwriting, L A T E X, and images. MathSeer sessions are also stored at automatically generated URLs that save all chips and their editing history. To avoid re-entering formulas, chips can be reused, edited, or used in creating other formulas. As users enter formulas, our novel autocompletion facility returns entity cards searchable by formula or entity name, making formulas easy to (re)locate, and descriptions of symbols and notation available before queries are issued.",

The new information that sophisticated math retrieval would provide, such as more easily locating definitions of symbols and other notations, finding usage, proofs and mathematical properties across disciplines, and compiling information on applications (e.g., variations of the log loss for machine learning) has stimulated work in math-aware search, alongside parallel developments in math question answering within the Natural Language Processing community [2] . To realize their full potential, math-aware search interfaces must be engaging and easy-to-use for different levels of expertise, and particularly for non-experts (e.g., students in middle school).",

Despite this, most math-aware search engines are restricted to two forms of input: (1) L A T E X (or MathML) entry in text boxes, and (2) visual template editors similar to the Microsoft Equation Editor [11, 13] . Many users find template editors confining, and so the text box approach is the most common, often in combination with a palette used to insert symbols and structures in the entry box. Text input is used by most online math-aware systems, including DLMF [8] , WebMIAS [10] , Math WebSearch [3] , Wolfram Alpha, SymboLab, SearchOnMath, and the (now-defunct) Springer L A T E X Search. Two challenges for text-based input are (1) most users are unfamiliar with L A T E X (even fewer know MathML), and (2) rendered formulas are shown separately from input, leading to users having difficulty locating entry errors [14] . Appealing solutions to these issues are handwritten formula input, formula image upload, and supporting the analogy of physically moving symbols around on a page [15] . These are key design elements in the MathSeer interface. In one study, a majority of the undergraduate participants reported preferring drawing over typing formulas given a choice between the two [12] . They also expressed formulas with handwriting that they could not using a keyboard (e.g., 4 2 ). To address these issues, our MathSeer search interface (see Fig. 1 ) allows formula input using a combination of typing L A T E X, uploading formula images, and drawing formulas by hand. 2 In MathSeer handwritten symbols are recognized each time a user stops drawing for a short time. Pressing a button recognizes formula structure, and copies the L A T E X result into the panel at the bottom-left of the interface. The L A T E X can then be edited, with a rendering of the formula updated in real-time (e.g., to quickly change 'p' to 'P'). At bottom-right, palettes containing symbols and structures may be used to insert corresponding L A T E X at the cursor position in the L A T E X panel.",

As an example use for template (grey) chips, ' dx' with a large space in the middle can be used as a template to quickly create other formulas with an integral, by dragging and dropping the chip from the favorites or history tab in the palette panel to the canvas. Recognized (blue) chips in the history and favorites tabs in the palette panel can also be used like palette buttons -clicking on them inserts their interpretation in the L A T E X panel, making it easy to re-use and insert large formulas. Chips may also be exported as images with metadata containing all chip data, allowing chip images to be later reused in MathSeer (e.g., using drag-and-drop) or shared with others (e.g., over email). Using chips for formula containers was inspired by the Approach0 interface. 3 MathSeer records the entire editing session, including all formula chips using an automatically generated URL that users can revisit later. The idea to use a URL to record editing state came from discussions with the creators of 2dsearch [9] .",

We use these to provide names and descriptions for individual symbols and formulas in real-time as they are entered [1] . Formula search over the card collection is done using Tangent-CFT embedding vectors [7] . In addition, we will soon allow formulas to be quickly found by searching concept names on cards (e.g., typing 'Pyt' brings up the card and formula for the Pythagorean Theorem). Further, we plan to allow users to create their own entity cards for formula chips. An illustration of math entity cards is shown in Fig. 2 . This view is expanded to show the full cards; in the unexpanded view only the formulas and titles are visible.",
