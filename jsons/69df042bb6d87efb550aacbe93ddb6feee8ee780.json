Distributed in mid-April 2020, the survey solicited information about how scientists' work changed from the onset of the pandemic, how their research output might be affected in the near future, and a wide range of individuals' characteristics.",

Some of this heterogeneity is due to field-specific differences, with laboratory-based fields being the most negatively affected, and some is due to gender, with female scientists reporting larger declines. However, among the individuals' characteristics examined, the largest disruptions are connected to a usually unobserved dimension: childcare. Reporting a young dependent is associated with declines similar in magnitude to those reported by the laboratory-based fields and can account for a significant fraction of gender differences. Amidst scarce evidence about the role of parenting in scientists' work, these results highlight the fundamental and heterogeneous ways this pandemic is affecting the scientific workforce, and may have broad relevance for shaping responses to the pandemic's effect on science and beyond.",

Throughout the U.S. and Europe, schools and workplaces were typically required to be closed and restrictions on gatherings of more than 10 people were in place in most countries 2 .

We find that among the four categories, research activities have seen the largest negative changes. Whereas total work hours decrease by 11.3% on average, research hours have declined by 24 .4% (teaching, fundraising, and \"all other tasks\" decrease by 1.9%, 9.3%, and 0.7%, respectively). Comparing the share of time allocated across the tasks ( Figure 1C -F), we find that research is the only category that sees an overall decline in the share of time committed (median changes: -16.2% for research, 0% for fundraising, +2.7% for teaching, and +2.0% for all other tasks). Overall, these results indicate that scientists' research time has been disrupted the most, and the declines in time spent on the other three categories are mainly due to the decline in total work hours. Furthermore, correlations suggest that research may be a substitute for each of the three other tasks (see SI S5.1 and Figure S4 ). Still, despite the large negative changes in research time, substantial heterogeneity remains, as 9.4% reported no change and 21.2% reported spending more time on research. The sizable heterogeneity begs the question as to what factors are most responsible for the observed heterogeneous effects among scientists.",

First, career stage appears to be a poor predictor of the impacts of the pandemic, as conditional changes in research time for older versus younger and tenured versus untenured faculty are statistically indistinguishable. Second, scientists who report being subject to a facility closure also report only minor unconditional differences in their research time ( Figure 2C ), and this feature is not selected by the Lasso as a relevant predictor for changes in research time. Third, there is a clear gender difference. Holding field and all other observable features fixed, female scientists report a 4.2% larger decline in research time (s.e.=1.5).",

Because childcare is often difficult to observe and rarely considered in science policies (aside from parental leave immediately following birth or adoption), addressing this issue may be an uncharted but important new territory for science policy and decision makers. Furthermore, it suggests that unless adequate childcare services are available, researchers with young children may continue to be affected regardless of the reopening plans of institutions.

In the coming years, researchers may be less willing or able to pursue positions outside of their home nation, which may deepen or alter global differences in scientific capacity. Future work expanding our understanding of how the pandemic is affecting researchers across different countries, at different institutions, and in different points of their life and career could provide valuable insights to more effectively protect and nurture the scientific enterprise. The strong heterogeneities we observe, and the likely development of new impacts in the coming months and years, both argue for a targeted and nuanced approach as the world-wide research enterprise rebuilds. 30.

The survey is conducted every two years, and we use the latest data available (2017 cycle). For this comparison, we focus only on university faculty in both our survey and the SDR. We also constrain our sample to only include fields of study with a clear mapping to the SDR categories. The SDR focuses only on researchers with Ph.D.-type degrees, and so it does not capture researchers with other degrees still actively engaged in research (i.e., researchers with only M.D.s). This means we exclude \"architecture and design,\" \"business management,\" \"medicine,\" \"education,\" \"humanities,\" and \"law and legal studies.\" Figure S2 compares respondents between our sample and the SDR sample. Figure S3a illustrates differences on demographics and career-stage features, including raw differences as well as those adjusted by field. We find only a small difference in age and no difference in partner status. Our survey oversamples on female scientists, those with children, and untenured faculty. These differences persist after conditioning on the scientist's reported field. That we ultimately find female scientists and those with young dependents to report the largest disruptions suggests that these individuals may have been more likely to respond to the survey in order to report their circumstances.

This motivates a multivariate regression analysis to explore whether changes associated with a group of individuals change after conditioning on other observables. However, selecting which of an available set of covariates (or transformations thereof) to include in a regression is notoriously challenging. The Lasso method provides a data-driven approach to this selection problem by excluding covariates from the regression that do not improve the fit of the model 11, 12 .",

To make minimal assumptions about the functional form of the control variables, we conduct the following transformations to expand the set of controls: for all continuous variables we use inverse hyperbolic sine (which approximates a logarithmic transformation while allowing zeros), square and cubic transformations, and we interact all indicator variables with the linear versions of the continuous variables.",

Still, to more quantitatively address this issue, we use historical data and another Lasso-based regression model to project scientists' publication output in 2020 and 2021, using their observable features from the survey and publication data since 2010. Our assumption is that these projections can approximate what scientists would have forecasted in the absence of the pandemic--they provide a crude counterfactual.

            "text": "The Lasso-based projection proceeds as follows. First, we demean the publication measures at the year level. This is because we do not want to attribute aggregate year-to-year variations across the entire sample to actual changes in net output, since these fluctuations can very plausibly be linked to changes in the Web of Science (WoS) coverage over time, and we are much more concerned with differential trends amongst different fields and/or different individuals. Next, we use the Lasso to select which of the observables are the best predictors of publication counts and citations. The major difference between this Lasso-based approach and the others used in this paper is that, here, we interact all observables with flexible time trends (i.e., squared, cubic, and inverse hyperbolic sine transformations of the year variable) to allow differential trends across groups. Finally, we project out these expected output measures as a function of the selected covariates and their corresponding coefficients from a post-LASSO OLS regression. Importantly, we project out of sample just two years so that we have estimates of the counterfactual trends for 2020 and 2021. With these estimates of respondents' counterfactual forecasts in hand, we then simply subtract them from scientists actual reported forecasts to arrive at our estimate of scientists' forecast of the \"net effect\" of the pandemic. Figure S3 plots the distributions of the unadjusted forecasts and these net effects for both the quantity and impact measures. The adjustment does not substantially change the distribution, but we are more confident in these estimates as \"pandemic effects\" for the aforementioned reasons. Figure S5 plots the reported changes in research time (y-axes) against the reported changes in time allocated to the other three task categories (x-axes). The figures are binned scatterplots, and linear fits of the data suggest that research may be a substitute for the other categories. A 10% increase in fundraising, teaching, or all other tasks is associated with a decline in research by 1.4% (s.e.=0.14), 4.6 % (s.e.=0.16), and 3.2% (s.e.=0.13), respectively. We lack exogenous variation in the data that can clearly shift the time allocated to one (or a subset) of tasks, so we cannot identify the extent to which these correlations reflect actual substitution patterns or unobserved factors. Though the magnitudes and precision of these relationships suggests further investigations are certainly warranted to better understand how scientists allocate their time. Figure S6a and S6b replicate Figures 2b and 2d from the main text, respectively, instead using each of the other three task categories for the dependent variable. For the analysis focused on fields (Fig. S6a) , no clear patterns emerge with respect to changes in time spent fundraising or teaching. Reported time changes in teaching may be due to a combination of reasons. First, during the pandemic, the demand for these activities is likely relatively stable (e.g., most academic institutions have moved classes online, but there are few reports of suspension of classes); and second, impacts due to the transition to online teaching may have taken place earlier, hence not captured by our survey. There is evidence that clinical science and biochemists are spending an increasing amount of time on the \"all other tasks\" category, which could plausibly be due to a redirection of effort directly towards pandemic-related (non-research) work.",

            "text": "For the analysis focused on demographic groups (Fig. S6b) , we find that scientists reporting a dependent under 5 years old tend to also report larger declines across all task categories. This result is consistent with an unsurprising hypothesis that these dependents require care that leads scientists to decrease their total work hours. The fact that there does not appear to be any substitution away from research towards these other categories for these specific individuals with young dependents suggests the association is driven by factors inherent to having a dependent at home, and not that these individuals also tend to select alternative work structures that has them performing less research and more of other tasks. Figure S7 recreates Figure 3b from the main text, but using the field-level Lasso approach. Forecasted changes in output are almost entirely confined to publication quantity (as opposed to impact), with the same fields of biology and chemistry that reported the largest declines in research time also forecasting the largest declines in publication output, here in the range of 4-10% relative to what would have been expected otherwise. Notably, some fields expect to publish more because of the pandemic, again highlighting the heterogenous experiences scientists are having due to the pandemic. Figure S8 recreates Figure 3b from the main text, but while including the reported changes in time allocated to each of the four task categories (in addition to the pre-pandemic reported time allocations as before). Again, we find a similar set of dependent-related variables to be most predictive of forecasted publication changes, even though the reported change in research time is also selected as relevant by the Lasso. For comparison, the forecasted disruption associated with a dependent under 5 years old (7.04% decline expected publication count) is approximately the same magnitude as the implied effect associated with a 26% decrease in research time.",

See the Methodology section 2 for more. Figure 3b from the main text, also including the scientists' reported changes in time committed to each of the four task categories. The error bars indicate 95% confidence intervals, and only variables selected in the corresponding Lasso selection exercises are included in the post-Lasso regression. The coefficient corresponding to the \"10%Change Time, Research\" variable indicates the percent change in the scientists' forecasted quantity or impact associated with a 10% increase in the change in reported research time. For example, we estimate that scientists who reported a 10% larger decline in their research time forecast that the pandemic will cause them to produce 2.67% fewer publications in 2020-2021.",
