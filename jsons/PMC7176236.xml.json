            "text": "The earliest coronavirus isolates were identified from mammalian and avian sources in the 1930s and 1940s (Beaudette and Hudson 1937; Doyle and Hutchings 1946; Cheevers and Daniels 1949). At this time, electron microscopy revealed prominent large spikes on the surface of virions, whose resulting crown-like appearance gave rise to the name coronavirus (Fig. 3.1). Coronaviruses have 4\u20135 structural proteins including the spike protein (S), envelope protein (E), membrane protein (M), nucleocapsid protein (N), and members of the coronavirus phylogenetic subgroup 2a have a shorter S protein called hemagglutinin esterase (HE). The SARS-CoV genome is unusually large at ~29.7 kb, and encodes 14 open reading frames for several proteins, (Marra et al. 2003; Rota et al. 2003). On the interior, the lipid envelope of SARS-CoV appears to have a gap observed as a low density in three-dimensional (3D) structures (Fig. 3.2) and then a more dense layer, which is presumably the surface of the nucleocapsid comprising mainly the N protein. Details of how this nucleocapsid is organized are not clear; however, the N protein is presumably anchored to the cytoplasmic side of the virion envelope via the M protein, which is a low abundance protein and may account for the \u201cgap\u201d of low density between the envelope and the nucleocapsid. Electron microscopic examination shows no evidence for supercoiled RNA such as that seen in paramyxoviruses and the interior appears amorphous by cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM); hence the arrangement whereby the RNA may be bound to the nucleocapsid protein is not clear.\n\n",

However, despite the size differences, the SARS-CoV spike performs the same fundamental task in viral entry to the host cell as other smaller type 1 viral fusion proteins, such as the influenza hemagglutinin (HA) (~220 kD per trimer). The SARS-CoV spike can be subdivided into four structural domains (from N to C terminus); two large external domains S1 and S2 are largely responsible for receptor binding and membrane fusion, respectively. In most type 1 viral fusion proteins the analogous peptides are generated by proteolysis of the spike precursor during the maturation process in the host cell, yielding two peptides with the fusion peptide on the N terminus of S2. In SARS-CoV the S1/S2 assignment is given based on sequence homology to other viral fusion proteins, although there appears to be no peptide cleavage. The final two small domains are comprised of a transmembrane domain, and a carboxyterminal cytoplasmic domain. The cell-surface molecule angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the receptor for the SARS-CoV S protein (Li et al. 2003) which is a relatively large macromolecule with a diameter of 70 \u00c5. By comparison, the receptor for influenza HA, sialic acid, is much smaller with a 10 \u00c5 diameter.",

Immunolabeling showed that these virions were intact antigenically as well as structurally (Fig. 3.1) and still able to bind to the SARS-CoV receptor, ACE2.",

The structures of both the spike and the spike\u2013ACE2 complex have been solved to 18.5 \u00c5 resolution (Figs. 3.2 and 3.3; Beniac et al. 2006, 2007). The spike shows a striking structure, being about 180 \u00c5 in diameter and with three distinct lobes or domains 50 \u00c5 thick on each subunit of the trimer (similar in appearance to the blades of a propeller), and a thin stalk connecting the spike to the viral envelope. The blades are twisted at an angle of ~30\u00b0 to the axis of symmetry, and are almost certainly composed of the spike S1 domain.\n",

When viewed end-on, the spike undergoes a rotation of ~5o following binding, and the mass at the center of the axis of symmetry on the distal end of the spike redistributes itself. These redistributions of mass were further identified in difference maps between the two reconstructions (Fig. 3.4). Upon ACE2 binding the spike undergoes a decondensation of mass around the central axis (Fig. 3.4b,g; blue). This region is the putative location of the S2 domain.

This motif is present in SARS-CoV (Hakansson-McReynolds et al. 2006) and other coronaviruses (Xu et al. 2004), as well as the hemagglutinin (HA) of influenza (Skehel and Wiley 2000), gp21 of human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (Kobe et al. 1999), gp41 of HIV(Weissenhorn et al. 1997), GP2 of Ebola (Weissenhorn et al. 1998; Malashkevich et al. 1999), and the fusion protein of paramyxovirus (Zhao et al. 2000; Chen et al. 2001). Type 1 viral fusion proteins can also be divided into two subtypes: those whose fusion mechanism is low pH-dependent such as influenza HA, and those that are pH-independent like the retroviral fusion proteins. In retroviruses, receptor binding itself can trigger fusion, with temperature and redox conditions also influencing the fusion mechanism (Hernandez et al. 1997; Damico et al. 1998). The SARS-CoV spike appears to be insensitive to redox conditions (Fenouillet et al. 2007). Although the factors which trigger fusion (endocytosis, pH sensitivity, single receptor vs. primary and coreceptor binding, redox change) differ amongst diverse virus families, all viral fusion proteins are thought to share the same basic fusion mechanism (Baker et al. 1999; Skehel and Wiley 2000; Dutch et al. 2000; Colman and Lawrence 2003; Dimitrov 2004; Hofmann and Pohlmann 2004).",

            "text": "By analogy with other type 1 viral fusion proteins, the fusion core of the SARS-CoV spike is thought to undergo similar structural rearrangements during fusion. The receptor-binding domain is localized in a position on the distal end of the molecule, closer to the 3-fold axis than anticipated, yet still in a position that would not impede these structural rearrangements. Putative mechanisms by which type 1 viral fusion proteins achieve membrane fusion have been proposed (Baker et al. 1999; Skehel and Wiley 2000; Dutch et al. 2000; Colman and Lawrence 2003; Dimitrov 2004), but complete structural evidence for the role of intermediate structures in these mechanisms has yet to be obtained. The structural biology of this process has been best characterized for the influenza HA, and paramyxovirus fusion protein (F) for which the prefusion and membrane fusion pH structures have been determined by X-ray crystallography (Sauter et al. 1992; Bullough et al. 1994; Skehel and Wiley 2000; Yin et al. 2005, 2006) (Fig. 3.5, inset). All of the subsequent models for type 1 viral fusion proteins are based on the structural data of these two fusion proteins. A drawback in all of these models is that they are based on recombinant ectodomains that are not proven to exist as a component in the complete molecule, and they lack both membrane-interacting residues and lipids (Skehel and Wiley 2000). The cryo-EM structures of intact SARS-CoV spike bound to native virion lipid envelopes are very instructive when atomic resolution fragments are docked within the overall molecule, especially as the entire SARS-CoV spike has proven to be a difficult subject for X-ray crystallography, and atomic resolution data exist for only a few fragments of the SARS-CoV spike. This structural data has been modeled into a scheme to propose a mechanism for SARS-CoV spike-mediated membrane fusion (Figs. 3.5 and 3.6). In the initial step the receptor-binding domain of the spike attaches to its human receptor ACE2. At this point the fusion core is in the prefusion configuration with the three heptad 2 repeats (HR2) forming a coiled-coil symmetric trimer at the center of the stalk of the spike (Hakansson-McReynolds et al. 2006).\n\n",

            "text": "During the next step of the membrane fusion process the virus is internalized in the cell by endocytosis and is exposed to a low pH environment, and may undergo proteolytic cleavage between the S1 and S2 domains (Simmons et al. 2005). The next step is fusion core rearrangement, so that the fusion peptide (FP) inserts into the host cell membrane. In Fig. 3.5 this initial process is illustrated with models M0\u2013M3, based on the atomic structure of the HR2 prefusion core, which begins to collapse upon itself in model M3 in a manner similar to that which occurs with influenza HA (Skehel and Wiley 2000). The inset in Fig. 3.5 illustrates this process in HA by coloring segments of S2 to illustrate the rearrangement from M0 to M3 that takes place. During this process we propose that the receptor-binding domain still holds on to ACE2 so that the fully extended fusion peptide will be positioned to penetrate through the host membrane. Our cryo-EM results show that it is possible for the spike to attach to three ACE2 receptors at once; this may serve to hold on to the host membrane like a tripod so as to accurately orientate the fusion core (Fig. 3.7). In addition the 30 \u00c5 gap between the axis of symmetry and ACE2 provides sufficient space for fusion core rearrangement. Damico et al. (1998) demonstrated that the kinetics of binding of the Rous sarcoma virus envelope protein ectodomain to liposomes was not linear with respect to receptor concentration. This suggested that activation of the trimeric ectodomain favored binding to multiple receptor monomers. One can therefore infer that other structurally homologous viral envelope proteins can also bind multiple receptors, which may be a general adaptation that provides the correct temporal and spatial arrangement to bring about membrane fusion. The observation that the SARS-CoV spike could bind three soluble ACE2 receptors provides three possible binding states with one, two or three membrane-bound receptors attached to the spike. In Fig. 3.7 we present these three states; with only one receptor bound the spike and virus have a wide range of movement possible, whereas with two receptors bound the movement is greatly restricted to motion in one plane only. Only in the case of three bound receptors will the spike and its fusion core be arranged perpendicular to the cell surface with minimal movement possible. At present it has not been demonstrated that membrane fusion requires the fusion core to be oriented perpendicular to the host cell membrane to function. However, one can hypothesize this based on the orientation of ACE2 on the distal end of the SARS-CoV spike. It is interesting to note that binding to three receptor molecules is the minimum number of binding events required to achieve this perpendicular orientation in 3D space. This observation matches up with the conserved trimeric structures of type 1 fusion proteins which are common amongst enveloped viruses, thus indicating that a possible conserved structural\u2013functional relationship may exist.\n",

            "text": "The next step in the membrane fusion process involves the refolding of the fusion core back upon itself to adopt the postfusion configuration (Supekar et al. 2004) (Fig. 3.5; models M4\u2013M6). In this configuration three heptad 1 repeats (HR1) form a parallel coiled-coil trimer, and the three HR2 pack in an antiparallel fashion in the hydrophobic grooves of the HR1 trimer. The result of this is that both the FP and transmembrane regions of the spike are brought in close proximity to each other, resulting in the host and viral membranes being in close contact. Each SARS-CoV virion has an average of 65 spikes (Beniac et al. 2006). At this density, several spikes would be close enough together to act in concert to disrupt the plasma membrane and induce pore formation between viral and cellular membranes. Opening of these pores would allow the SARS-CoV nucleocapsid to enter the host cell cytoplasm, as shown in our model in Fig. 3.6. Multiple SARS-CoV spike trimers may be involved in formation of the fusion pore, similar to the situation in influenza, where it has been suggested that between three and six HA trimers may be involved in the production of each fusion pore (Skehel and Wiley 2000). In Figs. 3.5 and 3.6 we have presented the ACE2\u2013SARS:S1 domains as they were solved in this cryo-EM investigation, for the model of membrane fusion that we present. For other fusion proteins like influenza HA1 and HIV GP120 it has been modeled that the rearrangements upon membrane fusion are dramatic involving a shedding of the above-mentioned domains. The cryo-EM investigations have detected structural movement of S1 upon ACE2 binding, which could represent the initial phase of this dramatic process that is postulated to occur in the course of membrane fusion.",

            "text": "An analysis of the structure of the spike\u2013receptor complex demonstrates how SARS-CoV can adapt to utilize receptors from different species and how they may evolve to gain specificity for new receptor types, in that there is redundancy and a great deal of protein mass that can accommodate evolutionary changes. RNA viruses have a high rate of mutation and recombination (Moya et al. 2004). In SARS-CoV the spike is able to retain specific binding affinity for the ACE2 of more than one host species, and rapid evolution to gain specificity for novel ACE2 species has been demonstrated (Li et al. 2005b, 2006). The large size of the spike of coronaviruses may be related to the use of large host cell-surface molecules such as ACE2 as specific receptors. Amongst the coronavirus family, specific cell-surface receptors for the S protein are all in the range of 60\u2013110 kD (Wentworth and Holmes 2001). These large host receptor molecules are of course functionally constrained and, in turn, relatively well conserved across species barriers. In utilizing binding to a large receptor molecule, the spike S1 domain also acts as a \u201cspacer arm\u201d holding the receptor far enough away from the threefold axis of symmetry of the spike S2 domain to permit fusion core rearrangement and subsequent membrane fusion. Such a property necessitates having a large spike molecule. Moreover, multiple receptor binding can have functional significance, enhancing the binding and entry of viruses. Cross-linking of adjacent host receptor molecules could increase the affinity of the virus for its target cell, as well as improving the kinetics of fusion. The SARS-CoV spike is a useful model system for the investigation of type 1 viral fusion protein dynamics. Utilizing this system for further research may lead to the possibility of developing broad-spectrum antivirals that target conserved cell fusion mechanisms shared by diverse virus families.",
