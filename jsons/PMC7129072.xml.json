These deletions are very small and result in no change in the reading frame, thus, the function of the deleted gp 7b is very likely to be intact in these viruses. In this study, we found that amplification of ORF7b from some FIP cats was difficult. Alteration of primer sets to target specific gene regions (data not shown), has not solved the problem of effective amplification. Is gp 7b truly indispensable in the natural FIP infection? Clarification of the presence or absence of ORF7b in FCoVs difficult to amplify may elucidate the role of gp7b in FIP pathogenesis.",
