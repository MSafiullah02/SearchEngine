Live virus vaccines rely on attenuation; e.g. use of reassortant strains with the backbone of cold-adapted viruses, but equal (or comparable) immunogenicity. For all the other types of vaccines derived from whole viral particles, a crucial step in production is virus inactivation. The general concept behind the inactivation procedure, stated by international guidelines as provided by EMA, FDA, and WHO [4], [5], [6], is that the process must inhibit the replication of the virus without destroying its antigenicity. Thus, the inactivation process should cause minimum alteration of the main antigens, which for influenza virus are the viral surface glycoproteins hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA).",

BPL reacts readily with nucleophiles, resulting in alkylated and acylated products. According to older literature, nucleic acids are the main targets of these modifications, which comprise nicks and cross-links between RNA and viral proteins [7], [8]. However, recent findings shed new light on the mechanism of BPL inactivation and show that it also alters viral proteins, resulting in loss of HA and NA functionality and fusion ability [9]. The stability of BPL is known to depend on the type of buffer and the pH of the mixture used, suggesting that the amount and nature of modifications in viral components will also be determined by these variables [10]. In the case of formaldehyde, viral inactivation is achieved by the alkylation of amino and sulphydrilic groups of proteins and purine bases [11]. As FA cross-links the viral proteins [12], the fusion ability of the virus can be affected.",

Recommendations in international guidelines regarding inactivation are, however, quite vague, and the establishment of optimal conditions is left to the manufacturers. Specifications provided for the inactivation procedure include indications on the temperature of storage and the maximum amount of inactivating agents. Nonetheless, the choice of variables such as the concentration of the virus at the time of inactivation, the buffer systems used to dilute the inactivators, the pH of the virus suspension, or the duration of the incubation with the agents remains yet unspecified. Furthermore, the guidelines are not clear about whether these parameters are to be optimized on the basis of the vaccine strain, the concentration of the virus or any other criterion.",

All seed viruses were obtained from the National Institute for Biological Standards and Controls, Potters Bar, United Kingdom and were propagated in 10 days old embryonated eggs. After inoculation of the virus and incubation for 72 h, the allantoic fluid was harvested and clarified by low speed centrifugation, followed by two rounds of purifications of the virus on a sucrose gradient [18]. Protein and phospholipid determinations were performed on the purified virus using the Micro Lowry and the Bligh and Dyer method, respectively [19], [20]. All virus preparations were used at a concentration of 0.5 nmol/\u00b5l of phospholipid for inactivation. The number of virus particles was calculated assuming that each virion contained about 100,000 phospholipid molecules. This number was derived using the reported composition (20\u201324% lipid) and dry weight (6 \u00d7 10\u221216 g) of influenza virions and a mean MW for lipids of 720\u2013750 g/mol [21]. This calculation does not take into account a possible contamination of the virus preparations with exosomes which would also be assumed to contain lipids and would presumably co-purify with virus on the sucrose gradient. However, the amount of exosomes is not expected to vary among the virus strains and is therefore neglected here.",

Our results show that, under the conditions used, BPL was quite efficient in inactivating the viral particles while formaldehyde, although reducing the infectious titer by 6\u20139 logs, was unable to completely abolish infectivity. All inactivation methods caused damage to the binding capacity of the viral particles, with BPL causing greater loss than FA. The ability of the virus to fuse with target membranes at low pH was especially affected by BPL treatment, while FA-treated virus still maintained some fusion ability. The stimulation of a TLR7 reporter cell line was also affected by the treatment, with FA inactivation leading to a greater loss of the ability to stimulate TLR7 than BPL inactivation. The magnitude of the effects caused by BPL or FA treatment appeared to be virus strain dependent, as different IAV strains were affected to varying degrees. From our results, it is clear that chemical inactivation impacts on various properties of influenza virus in a treatment dependent and strain dependent way.",

To determine the effects of the different inactivation protocols on the recognition of the virus by HA-specific antibodies, we tried to perform a single radial diffusion (SRID) assay on the virus samples before and after the inactivation procedure. However, the relatively low concentration of virus used for inactivation (chosen to allow optimal access of the inactivating agent to the viral proteins) was not suitable to render reliable readings. Yet, functional properties of the viral HA, namely binding to sialic acid residues on the target cell and mediating fusion of the viral and the endosomal membrane, are also indicative of a functional and unaltered protein. We therefore investigated the effects of the different inactivation protocols on hemagglutination and on hemolysis as surrogates for binding and fusion, respectively. As all our observations are based on in vitro tests, the correlation with the different vaccine potencies in vivo should be explored in future experiments. The use of single radial immunodiffusion assay as an estimate for protection has been shown to correlate both with in vivo responses [35] and, more recently, with in vitro results of differently manufactured influenza vaccine [36]. However, while the SRID assay would have been an alternative method to measure HA integrity, it would have given information on antibody binding only.",

Fusion was even more deeply affected as all virus strains completely lost their ability to fuse after treatment with BPL. Virus binding to the target membrane is a prerequisite for fusion (at least as measured in the assay used). Thus, the loss of fusion ability was to be expected. Previous reports have shown that H1N1 and H3N2 viruses had reduced agglutination capacity following BPL treatments [7], [9], [15], [17], [37] - although in many cases the inactivation was performed at different temperatures, incubation times or concentrations than used in our experiments. For what concerns the effects of BPL on the fusion ability of IAV, some studies show that H1N1 and H3N2 strains were almost completely inhibited in their fusion ability at BPL concentrations ranging from 0.025% to 0.08% [9], [37]. However, Budimir et al. [23] managed to inactivate IAV with BPL and retain the fusion ability of the virus; yet, the temperature discrepancy with our methods could have led to the observed differences in virus alterations.",

The higher immunogenicity of WIV could be largely attributed to activation of TLR7 by ssRNA present in the viral particles [38]. Furthermore, since the stimulation of an endosomal Toll-like receptor depends on viral endocytosis (and thus on HA functionality) [39], the decreased stimulation of such a receptor can indicate possible modifications of the surface antigen induced by the inactivation procedure. We therefore investigated the effect of the different inactivation methods on TLR7 triggering. All inactivation procedures studied markedly reduced and often completely abolished TLR7 triggering, with effects of BPL inactivation being somewhat less severe than those of FA treatment. This was surprising considering that BPL is supposed to mainly affect nucleic acids while FA is supposed to mainly affect proteins [11]. Loss of TLR7 triggering did not necessarily correlate with loss of binding and was thus not only a result of less virus reaching the endosomal compartment. To our knowledge, the effect of virus inactivation on the capability of WIV to trigger TLR7 has not been studied previously. Earlier studies demonstrating that WIV is capable of activating TLR7 were performed using much higher concentrations of virus (10 \u00b5g/ml viral protein as compared to about 0.03 \u00b5g/ml used in this study) [25]. In these studies, effects of the inactivation procedure might therefore have been obscured.",

Though all the studies were in compliance with the established guidelines with respect to BPL concentration (\u22640.1%), all used different conditions with respect to buffer, virus concentration, incubation time and temperature etc. This might explain variations in outcome among the different studies. One of the initial effects of BPL addition is a decrease in pH caused by hydrolysis of BPL to \u03b2-propionic acid and hydracrylic acid derivatives [25]; this could then lead to all the other observed undesirable consequences of BPL treatment on HA and NA functions.

Novel inactivation protocols, such as UV and gamma radiation [46] or the use of hydrogen peroxide [13], have already been mentioned in the literature but will need thorough testing and standardization before they can be employed in the context of influenza vaccine production. There are currently new emerging technologies to manufacture influenza vaccines that would not require an inactivation process, such as production of IAV proteins on in vitro cultures or peptides derived from IAV proteins, all showing promising results; yet, egg cultures are currently the cheapest and most efficient way to produce high amounts of vaccines in a relative short amount of time. Therefore, until a new vaccine production method that can compete with the egg culture is developed, inactivation will be a standard procedure in vaccine manufacturing. Our results are therefore a call for establishment of more detailed inactivation procedures for vaccine manufacturers, and for a search for different and more efficient inactivation methods to be included in the international guidelines.",

Sucrose gradient-purified virus preparations at a concentration of 0.5 nmol/\u00b5l were treated with 0.1% BPL overnight (BPL) or with 0.01% FA for 2 days (FA-2) or for 4 days (FA-4). Infectivity of live virus and vaccines was assessed by infection of MDCK cells. Two-fold serial dilutions of virus or vaccine starting at a concentration of 0.1 nmol/\u00b5l of phospholipids were added to the cells and removed after 1 h. After 72 h of incubation in a medium containing TPCK-trypsin, the supernatants were harvested and presence of virus was determined by hemagglutination assay. TCID50 was calculated as described previously [22].",

Subsequently, 50 \u00b5l of supernatant were added to 150 \u00b5l of detection medium, for assessment of NF-\u03baB-induced production of the reporter protein. The stimulation of the cells was determined as percentage of activation, as compared to the activation achieved with 50 ng/ml of the TLR7 stimulant R848 (set as 100% activation).
