The Organization for Economic and Cooperative Development (OECD) science and health ministers have concluded in their last annual report that biotechnology will be a key driver for sustainable growth and development in the OECD member countries and beyond (OECD Report, 2004). Today, some developing nations with enormous human capital like India, China, Brazil, and Korea have been able to demonstrate their capabilities and accomplishments through several biotechnology R and D activities. Many others in countries like Mexico, Argentina, Chile, South Africa, Egypt, Thailand, Hungary and the Czech Republic are ready and eager to follow their example. However, the road ahead will prove to be a difficult one for most developing nations. Support for the development of therapies and products for endemic and neglected diseases requires the building of a sustainable infrastructure in these nations. In many countries, the typical prerequisite elements of well-educated and trained population, scientific excellence, business-friendly set of intellectual property rights, regulatory infrastructure and healthcare system are simply not sufficient or absent (Marshall, 2004). The lack of these essential building blocks presents enormous hurdles to the nascent biotechnology industry in these developing countries. Industrialized nations and international organizations have the obligation to encourage innovation, form new collaborative alliances with institutions in developing countries, and provide them with sustainable guidance and resources for building a capable biotechnology infrastructure that are so urgently needed.",

Unfortunately, medicines developed by multinational companies are too expensive and individuals in developing nations, who must pay for medicines out of their own pocket, cannot afford them. For example, for an AIDS drug cocktail patent holders can charge up to US $10,000 annually in certain markets. However, in the absence of patent regulations, makers of generic drugs sell their versions for less than US $300 (Boulet et al., 2003). Even the less expensive drugs may still be inaccessible to the extremely poor. Many developing countries unable to compete with or afford competitors' products have focused their biotechnology impetus to produce affordable therapeutic alternatives, instead of supporting novel drug innovation. This was largely possible because of lenient patenting regulations (Thorsteinsdotir et al., 2004). India, the world leader in generic drug manufacture, is a prime example of reducing cost of production in this way while making medicines affordable to underprivileged individuals (Kumar et al., 2004).",

When these two conditions are met, access to key technologies and models of successful product development by the NIH can enhance the prevention and care of infectious and non-communicable diseases.

Moreover, OTT has also initiated an international technology transfer capacity building program to train scientists and managers from developing countries.

It would allow them to develop technologies appropriate to their own regional needs, enabling local and regional solutions to public health needs (OECD, 2003, Varmus et al., 2003, Saha et al., 2004). The NIH mission extends beyond the borders of the United States for reasons that reflect its statement: \u201cScience in pursuit of fundamental knowledge about the nature and behavior of living systems and the application of that knowledge to extend healthy life and reduce the burdens of illness and disability.\u201d1\nThe NIH is committed to achieving this mission by fostering fundamental creative discoveries, innovative research strategies, and their applications as a basis to advance significantly the Nation's capacity to protect and improve health; and developing, maintaining, and renewing scientific human and physical resources that will assure the Nation's capability to prevent disease.

Such an approach may foster biomedical innovation while significantly reducing R and D expenditures, which often pose as barriers to justifying new drug development for combating many neglected diseases. The advantages were most recently exemplified through the Human Genome Project initiative by placing all relevant scientific data and resources into public domain without allowing any one entity to hold a patent to the invention. Much needed cures for tropical diseases can be developed through such an approach (Maurer et al., 2004). Similarly, various types of patent pooling arrangements for a particular technology could provide relief to the challenges of IP fragmentation presently stifling biomedical development and thus access to essential medicines. For example, the development of technologies for intervention of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) could be expedited and licensing costs reduced by cooperative pooling of SARS-related patents (Rimmer, 2004). Creation of such win-win situations for the IP holders, vaccine manufacturers, and populations in need is gaining increased consideration.",

Many developing countries stand to benefit the most from licensed NIH invention, when they develop the technologies locally for prices affordable to their underprivileged populations. Such transfer of technologies may play a particularly important role in turning early-stage technologies into useable products in third world countries. Importantly, by enabling indigenous institutions to develop NIH technologies in these regions, local capacity in research and development, market competitiveness, experienced work force and scientific excellence will improve, the biotechnology infrastructure will grow consequently and ultimately will help strengthen and stabilize the developing countries' economies. Many successes of active participation of developing countries in R and D activities for meeting local needs already exist: (1) The production of Hepatitis B vaccine by multiple Indian companies (Kumar et al., 2004); (2) the recombinant human insulin vaccine developed and produced in Brazil in the 1990's to meet its population's needs (Ferrer et al., 2004); and (3) Egypt's advances in agbiotechnology field aimed to meet acute insulin shortages by locally developing recombinant human insulin (Abdelgafar et al., 2004).",

In addition, the financial and logistical challenges of international efforts to provide anti-retroviral drugs to developing countries are well known. In case of malaria, the disease was virtually eradicated through use of insecticides and malaria drugs in North America and Europe. Ironically, this practice led to increasingly resistant mosquito vectors in Africa, Asia and Latin America, but no efforts were made toward the development of malaria vaccine, as malaria represents a low priority health risk in developed nations. This situation lead the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to launch and support the Malaria Vaccine Initiative (MVI) in an effort to address this serious shortcoming and to accelerate the vaccine development to combat this disease that affects millions of people all round the world (MVI, 2004).",

Several research studies indicate that this is the best approach to combating long-term neglected diseases in poor countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, parts of Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean, and Eastern Europe (Boulet et al., 2003, WHO, 2003).7\nIndeed, recent work by well-respected private foundations such as the Gates and the Rockefeller Foundations and policy-makers emphasizes developing countries' \u201cneed for self-reliance and national production [of health-biotechnologies] to ensure that country-specific disease needs can be met\u201d (Saha et al., 2004, Thorsteinsdotir et al., 2004, Maurer et al., 2004).8\nThe World Intellectual Property Organization's (WIPO) Cooperation for Development Program is committed to tailoring its activities in implementing IP strategies to the diverse infrastructures and needs of developing countries (WIPO, 2004). Similarly, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) states strongly that \u201cthe transfer of technology to developing countries is a key element so that countries can develop their own R and D infrastructure and capabilities to meet their own needs\u201d (OECD, 2002).

With its leadership in biomedical research and innovation, as well as its management of technology commercialization across sectors, the U.S. is in a prime position to lead and help other countries formulate appropriate technology-transfer procedures in the developed world.10\nAnd as a leader in biomedical research, the NIH OTT can play a significant role in international technology transfer (Zerhouni, 2003). With its large portfolio and more than 15 years of experience in technology transfer, the NIH OTT is also well positioned to move technologies to the private sector for commercialization in the US and abroad.11\nOut of a total of 2968 executed licenses or license amendments, about 428 licenses have been executed to a foreign entity to date. In FY 2004, there were 32 foreign licenses (27 new and 5 amendments) executed out of a total of 276 (of which 196 were new licenses and 80 were amendments). There are even more opportunities for international technology transfer because some developing countries, such as China, India, Brazil, and South Africa, have become emerging economies with expertise in advanced technological (biomedical R and D) capabilities.",

The NIH OTT has utilized both types of licenses as incentives to develop products for the developing world. Intellectual property rights can only be enforced in countries where a patented technology is used to manufacture a product or in countries where the product is sold. Thus, in countries where the patent owner has not sought patent protection, as is often the case in many developing countries, a biological materials license agreement can be an important incentive in providing the institutions with some level of market protection for the transfer of technologies. In addition, NIH OTT has utilized geographic exclusivity or co-exclusivity as an incentive for a licensee to develop a biotechnology-related product for a particular regional market. When an exclusive license is not needed to encourage commercialization, non-exclusive licensing, regionally or worldwide, will allow multiple parties to compete in the market to develop a product. It is anticipated that these license strategies might have a major impact on the access to health technologies by those in great need in industrialized and developing countries.",

Royalty fees are negotiated on a case by case basis, depending on factors such as the marketing plan, market size, potential use for the public interest, and the need to license additional technologies. Using this paradigm allows the OTT to fulfill its statutory requirement to favor small U.S. businesses for the U.S. market and to use exclusive licensing strategies only as needed.",

For example, OTT licensed a vaccine conjugation technology to the PATH to develop a conjugated meningococcal vaccine in collaboration with the World Health Organization (WHO). The Serum Institute in India will manufacture the vaccine for eventual distribution in Sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East, Latin America and the Caribbean, and Eastern Europe.

Depending on the country and geographic region, the license is exclusive, co-exclusive, or non-exclusive. The degree of exclusivity was determined by the needs of the prospective licensees in each country. By granting exclusive rights only when needed to spur commercialization and segment the world market, the strategy allows the market to drive the degree of exclusivity and thus increase the likelihood that the technology will be developed for worldwide distribution. In the case of an effective human-bovine vaccine, such a goal is very important because it would significantly reduce childhood deaths related to this infection in developing countries.",
