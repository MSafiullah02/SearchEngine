Correcting dehydration, water, electrolyte, and acid base imbalances PO is preferable, because it represents a low-cost alternative and provides an easy method of treatment. 4 The oral route is contraindicated in cases of paralytic ileus, when animals show acute fluid loss. 5 Intravenous (IV) treatment is necessary to rapidly replace fluids and electrolytes. 4, 5 Traditionally, isotonic crystalloid solutions, including 0.9% sodium chloride, 5% glucose, and simple Ringer's or lactated Ringer's solution, have been utilized for IV hydration. However, there are many difficulties involved in using crystalloid solutions. Specifically, large volumes of fluids are required, a large amount of time is spent on administration of the fluids, and venous catheterization and frequent monitoring are required with this method of treatment. 6 To address these difficulties, a number of studies have examined alternative methods for IV replacement of fluids. Small quantities of HSS (7.2%) were shown to be an efficient treatment in animals with hypovolemic shock, severe dehydration, 7, 8 and endotoxemia. 9 This type of treatment should be supplemented with another solution, because the positive effect produced by treatment with HSS is brief (approximately 2 hours) and because this treatment results in considerable increases in serum concentrations of sodium and chloride. 10 In addition, HSS does not correct acid base imbalance and exacerbates metabolic acidosis. 4 Absorption of PO administered fluid can be facilitated by IV administration of hypertonic saline-dextran (HDS) solution. 10 This solution can induce a rapid increase in plasma volume and cardiac output in calves by shifting fluid from the intracellular space and gastrointestinal tract. 5 of HDS together with an oral alkalinizing solution in calves with diarrhea. 10, 11 None of these experiments led to metabolic acidosis, an important cause of lethargy and death in calves with diarrhea and dehydration.

The addition of dextran to HSS prolonged the effects of this solution. 10 This study showed that a combination of HSS + IES, without the addition of dextran, was able to correct severe dehydration in these calves (Tables 2 and 3 ). The disadvantage of using dextran, besides increasing the cost of treatment per calf, is that dextran can cause coagulopathy as well as an anaphylactic reaction. 18 Hyponatremia, hypochloremia, and hyperkalemia are common in calves with spontaneous diarrhea. 5 Hypernatremia also is observed in calves with diarrhea, and is related to low plasma protein concentrations. 5 In this study, fluid loss was isosmotic because chloride and sodium concentrations were unchanged after induction of diarrhea. However, Sen et al 2 did not observe alterations in serum sodium or chloride concentrations when they evaluated calves with diarrhea caused by unknown factors. In calves with endotoxemia, the use of HSS causes increases in serum sodium and chloride concentrations, but this effect only lasts 60 minutes. 9 According to Kaneko et al, 13 most domestic animals tolerate greater sodium intake if they have adequate access to water. Animals treated with HSS ingested a larger amount of water after treatment compared with other groups, although it was not possible to quantify the amount. Hyperkalemia was observed in all animals after induction of diarrhea (Table 3) . Similar results were observed by other authors who used saccharose and 3 types of diuretics to induce diarrhea and dehydration in calves. 10 However, when only saccharose and furosemide were used to induce diarrhea and dehydration, there was no change in serum potassium concentrations. 11 Hyperkalemia occurs by translocation of potassium from the intracellular to the extracellular space in response to low concentrations of sodium in the extracellular fluid, or as a compensatory mechanism for acidosis. 4, 13, 14 This imbalance responds to rehydration by restoration tissue perfusion, decreasing extracellular potassium concentration, and correcting metabolic acidosis. 4, 13 For rehydration to be effective, sodium concentration must be reestablished and Na, K-ATPase can function at full capacity and carry potassium into cells. 13, 17 All solutions were able to reduce hyperkalemia. The low potassium concentrations in animals treated with HSS are related to rapid expansion of the extravascular volume and a strong ion effect resulting in extracellular potassium exchange for sodium. 4 Decreased potassium concentration after administration of HSS + dextran has been documented previously, but was not considered clinically important. 8 Metabolic acidosis is a common finding in calves with spontaneous diarrhea. 19, 20 In addition, the reduction in circulating blood volume associated with dehydration increases production of lactic acid (because of poor tissue perfusion) and limits the ability of the kidneys to excrete hydrogenous ions. 3, 17 Severe acidosis also impairs control of brain volume, causing lethargy and coma. 13, 14 Changes in acid base balance also were confirmed by a significant increased in anion gap values at Time 0. The anion gap is very useful in categorizing the acid base imbalances. 13, 14 An increased anion gap is associated with metabolic acidosis caused by increase in the organic acids (lactic acid and ketoacids). 13 Higher concentrations of L-lactate were observed at Time 0 in all groups ( Table 2) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 710, "end": 712, "text": "4,", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 713, "end": 716, "text": "16,", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 717, "end": 719, "text": "17", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 908, "end": 910, "text": "8,", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 911, "end": 913, "text": "10", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 987, "end": 989, "text": "10", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1310, "end": 1312, "text": "18", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1407, "end": 1408, "text": "5", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1518, "end": 1519, "text": "5", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1951, "end": 1952, "text": "9", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1980, "end": 1982, "text": "13", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 2819, "end": 2821, "text": "4,", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 2822, "end": 2825, "text": "13,", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 2826, "end": 2828, "text": "14", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2986, "end": 2988, "text": "4,", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 2989, "end": 2991, "text": "13", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 3147, "end": 3150, "text": "13,", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 3151, "end": 3153, "text": "17", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 3404, "end": 3405, "text": "4", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 3555, "end": 3556, "text": "8", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 3633, "end": 3636, "text": "19,", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 3637, "end": 3639, "text": "20", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3861, "end": 3863, "text": "3,", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 3864, "end": 3866, "text": "17", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 3948, "end": 3951, "text": "13,", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 3952, "end": 3954, "text": "14", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4133, "end": 4136, "text": "13,", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 4137, "end": 4139, "text": "14", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4270, "end": 4272, "text": "13", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1129, "end": 1144, "text": "(Tables 2 and 3", "ref_id": "FIGREF3"}, {"start": 2300, "end": 2309, "text": "(Table 3)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4348, "end": 4356, "text": "Table 2)", "ref_id": "TABREF2"}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "The SIG provides an estimate for the difference among the net strong ion charge of plasma nonvolatile buffers (albumin, globulin, and phosphate), unmeasured strong anion concentrations (L-lactate, D-lactate, sulfate, nonesterified fatty acids, ketoacids, pH-independent phosphate charge, and other strong anions), and unmeasured strong cation concentrations (Ca 2+ , Mg 2+ ).

The mechanism by which the diuretic effect of furosemide is produced is by its direct action on renal tubular function. To correct hypovolemia, the body increases reabsorption of sodium. However, to maintain electroneutrality, the sodium reabsorption in the proximal tubule must be accompanied by reabsorption of anions, such as chloride. Because the patient is hypochloremic, a greater amount of sodium reaches the distal tubule, where, under the action of aldosterone, hydrogenous ions are secreted to retain sodium. Renal excretion of hydrogenous ions is directly proportional to bicarbonate reabsorption, giving rise to metabolic alkalosis. 22, 23 The main action of hydrochlorothiazide is to increase the urinary excretion of sodium and chloride. 23, 24 Spironolactone acts as a specific aldosterone antagonist, primarily by competitive binding of receptors at the aldosterone-dependent sodium potassium exchange site in the distal convoluted renal tubule. 23, 24 Spironolactone therefore will antagonize the hypokalemic effect of furosemide and hydrochlorothiazide, 23 but exert a weaker diuretic, natriuretic, and chloruretic effect than furosemide. In this study, the use of higher doses of saccharose, hydrochlorothiazide, and spironolactone caused diarrhea, dehydration, and metabolic acidosis. In the venous circulation, metabolic acidosis has a vasoconstrictive effect, which tends to centralize blood flow and predispose to pulmonary congestion. Acid base abnormalities frequently are present in sick calves. 21 One of the main compensatory effects to decrease the degree of systemic metabolic acidosis is the urinary excretion of hydrogenous ions. Because of the state of dehydration, there is a prominent decrease in urine volume, substantially decreasing the elimination of hydrogenous ions, and responsible for the decreased blood pH. 4, 17 The results demonstrate that treatment with IES and IES + HSS were effective in correcting metabolic acidosis by removing excess hydrogen ions, increasing renal flow and buffering by acetate. To be metabolized in the canine liver, acetate requires 2 molecules of hydrogen ions. In a study comparing the effects of oral rehydration with sodium bicarbonate or sodium acetate in calves with spontaneous diarrhea, investigators found that both solutions were capable of treating metabolic acidosis 12 hours after administration. 25 Acetate has an advantage over bicarbonate because it does not alkalinize the abomasal fluid or interfere with the coagulation of milk. 26 Sodium acetate also stimulates the absorption of water in the small intestine 27 and is easily metabolized by peripheral tissues. 26 The calves in this study continued to receive saccharose along with milk during the treatment phase. Studies in calves with spontaneous diarrhea 2 and diarrhea induced by Escherichia coli 27 showed that metabolic acidosis can cause a decrease in pCO 2 . One form of compensation during metabolic acidosis is an increase in ventilation and a consequent decrease in pCO 2. 13 However, this compensation was brief, and metabolic acidosis can persist for more than 24 hours before any sign of respiratory compensation. The lack of change in pCO 2 after induction of diarrhea may be because of the fact that measurements during this period were taken at relatively large intervals and the animals could have shown signs of respiratory compensation during the time periods between measurements. The current recommended treatment for moderately dehydrated diarrheic calves is PO electrolyte administration alone, whereas combined administration of fluids IV and PO electrolyte administration is a fundamental requirement for treating severely dehydrated diarrheic calves. 6 Traditional isotonic fluid administration is difficult and expensive to accomplish in the field, requiring venous catheterization, large volumes of isotonic fluid, and periodic monitoring. 7, 10 Fluids with low osmolality (300 mOsm/kg) have inadequate energy content because they have insufficient glucose. If the electrolyte is supplied without concomitant milk it is recommended to use a high osmolality solution (600 mOsm/L). 20 Although we did not offer milk to the calves during treatment, the association of IES + HSS may have increased the absorption of glucose from the isotonic electrolyte solution, causing glucose concentrations to remain similar to those at Time 0, which did not occur in other groups where there was a decrease in glucose concentrations after treatment.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 700, "end": 702, "text": "23", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 803, "end": 806, "text": "23,", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 807, "end": 809, "text": "24", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1013, "end": 1016, "text": "23,", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1017, "end": 1019, "text": "24", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1123, "end": 1125, "text": "23", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1573, "end": 1575, "text": "21", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1903, "end": 1905, "text": "4,", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1906, "end": 1908, "text": "17", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 2434, "end": 2436, "text": "25", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 2572, "end": 2574, "text": "26", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 2705, "end": 2707, "text": "26", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 3773, "end": 3774, "text": "6", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 3964, "end": 3966, "text": "7,", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 3967, "end": 3969, "text": "10", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "The treatment of osmotic diarrhea and dehydration with HSS, IES, or HSS + IES (Table 3) was not able to change the consistency of feces.
