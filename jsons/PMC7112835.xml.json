The occurrence of turkey coronaviral enteritis is still reported in many states of the U.S. There are no effective vaccine and treatment available for prevention and treatment of the disease. Therefore, rapid detection, differentiation, and quantitation of TCoV are very critical to monitor and control TCoV infection in the turkey flocks.",

            "text": "Turkey coronavirus belongs to the antigenic group 3 in the family Coronaviridae. It is a pleomorphic enveloped virus with the size about 80\u2013160 nm in diameter. There are 20 nm long club-shaped projections around the virions. The genomic nucleic acid is a linear, positive sense, single stranded RNA. The major structural proteins include spike (S) glycoprotein, membrane (M) protein and nucleocapsid (N) protein. The S protein is highly variable among different coronaviruses while M and N protein are more conserved between different antigenic groups. The S proteins of coronaviruses have been reported to form peplomer structures on the surface of coronavirus, which bind to cell receptors and induce cell fusion and neutralizing antibodies (Lu et al., 2004). The similarity of S gene nucleotide and amino acid sequence among coronaviruses varies. Although TCoV and infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) are in the same antigenic group, the S gene nucleotide sequence of TCoV only share 30\u201340% homology to that of IBV (Lin et al., 2004). The amino terminal S1 region of several coronaviruses has been reported to contain the receptor binding domain. It can bind to cellular receptors, induce neutralizing antibodies, and determine host specificity and tropism (Hwang et al., 2006, Sheahan et al., 2008). The carboxyl terminal S2 region consisting of transmembrane domain can induce cell fusion and viral assembly (Broer et al., 2006, Howard et al., 2008). The S2 gene is more conserved than S1 gene between different coronaviruses and between different strains or isolates of the same coronavirus (Cavanagh, 2005, Lin et al., 2004, Loa et al., 2006a, Loa et al., 2006b). Therefore, S2 gene is a better target to detect TCoV isolates and differentiate TCoV from other coronaviruses.",

Because there is no cell culture system for TCoV, the virus isolation has to use turkey eggs for propagation of the virus, which is time consuming and labor intensive. Immunofluorescent antibody assay and IP are antibody-based methods. They are simpler and faster than virus isolation but the sensitivity is very low. Since the sequence information of TCoV was available, RT-PCR has been developed and it has high specificity and sensitivity. It has been applied to detect TCoV RNA in fecal samples and intestinal contents of infected turkeys (Breslin et al., 2000, Loa et al., 2006a). Nevertheless, none of the above-mentioned methods can rapidly differentiate and quantitate TCoV.",

Quantitative data can be accessed by the standard curve established with serial dilutions of standard RNA. This method has been applied to quantitative detection of many coronaviruses, including canine coronavirus (CCov), feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) and severe acute respiratory syndromes coronavirus (SARS CoV) (Decaro et al., 2004, Gut et al., 1999, Hui et al., 2004). The procedure dose not need post-PCR electrophoresis so the processing time can be saved and the risks for carry-over and cross-contamination between samples can be lessen. The purpose of the present study was to develop a sensitive and specific one-step RRT-PCR to detect, differentiate, and quantitate TCoV RNA in the feces and tissues.",

To obtain a standard for quantitative RRT-PCR for TCoV, the in vitro transcripts of pTriEx3-6F/6R were generated by using RiboMAXTM large scale RNA production system-T7 (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). The pTriEx-6F/6R transcripts were treated with DNase, purified by Zymo DNA clean and concentrate kit (Zymo, Orange, CA, USA), and quantified by spectrophotometer at 260 nm wavelength. Ten-fold serial dilutions of the RNA transcripts were made in RNase-free water and analyzed by RRT-PCR with the procedures described above to establish standard curve for quantification and determine the limit for detection. The standard curves were created by plotting the Ct value against each dilution of known concentration. The formula used to calculate the copy numbers per \u03bcl is as followed: copies/\u03bcl = (ng/\u03bcl \u00d7 10\u22129)/(MW of transcript) \u00d7 (6.023 \u00d7 1023).",

The designed primers and probe can distinguish TCoV from other pathogens, including E. coli, Salmonella, rotavirus, reovirus, enterovirus, avian influenza virus, Newcastle disease virus, turkey herpesvirus, and other coronaviruses (CCoV, BCoV, TGEV, FIPV, and IBV). Based on the studies by IFA, immunoperoxidase (IP) procedures, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and sequence analysis, there is a close antigenic and genomic relationship between TCoV and IBV (Akin et al., 2001, Guy et al., 1997, Lin et al., 2002, Loa et al., 2000, Stephensen et al., 1999). In addition, experimental infection studies using the animals have showed that TCoV could replicate in the enteric tissues of chickens without causing clinical signs (Gelb et al., 1987, Guy, 2000), BCoV could replicate in the intestines of turkeys with no or mild clinical diseases (Dea et al., 1991, Ismail et al., 2001), and IBV could maintain in the blood of infected turkeys up to 48 h via intravenous inoculation (Gelb et al., 1987). Thus, rapid, accurate, and specific detection of TCoV is critical to the control and eradication of turkey enteritis in the turkey flocks. Two RRT-PCR assays for the detection of avian enteritis viruses have been reported and could be applied to the detection of TCoV. One assay was designed to target M gene of TCoV and the other was targeted 5\u2032 un-translated region of IBV genome. However, both gene sequences are conserved between TCoV and IBV (Callison et al., 2006, Spackman et al., 2005). Therefore, both assays could not detect TCoV differentially. The present study targeted the unique region of TCoV S gene that is specific to TCoV and conserved among various TCoV isolates and could detect, differentiate, and quantitate TCoV specifically.",
