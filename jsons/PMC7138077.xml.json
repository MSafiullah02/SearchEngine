These values have also underpinned the country's foreign policy, in view of its geopolitical position as a so-called middle power.2 These aspirations remain relevant today, as Canada marks 150 years since Confederation while grappling with its troubling treatment of Indigenous peoples, who inhabited the land for thousands of years before colonisation.",

            "text": "In this second paper of a two-part Series on Canada's health system and global health leadership,3 we analyse how this ideal of Canada as a work in progress, combined with its international position as a middle power, has shaped its role in global health policy and action. The country has mostly sought to be a socially progressive force, punching above its weight and exerting influence disproportionate to its financial and military resources. Leaders in Canada have been prominent and respected contributors to global health research, practice, and diplomacy for decades (panel 1\n). At times, however, the tendency to give primacy to consensus building, inclusion, and equity has led to a lack of decisiveness and timely strategic action. Conversely, when Canada has strayed from progressive social values, and economic self-interest has been prioritised in foreign policy, the country's perceived leadership in the global health community has diminished. On the basis of this analysis, we identify lessons for the Canadian federal government, acting strategically with limited political and economic resources, to translate values of equity and inclusion into strong, bold, and much-needed leadership in global health.Panel 1Canadian contributions to global health\n\u2022The discovery of insulin in 1921 by Canadian physician Frederick Banting and medical student Charles Best\u2022The development of Rh immunoglobulin by Alvin Zipursky, Jack Bowman, and Bruce Chown in the 1960s, contributing to the elimination of rhesus haemolytic disease\u2022Leadership on the World Federation of Public Health Associations since 1985 by Margaret Hilson\u2022The discovery of natural immunity to HIV by Francis Plummer in 1988, based on a cohort of sex workers in Kenya, which signalled the potential for a future vaccine\u2022The birth of evidence-based medicine in the 1990s\u2014the assessment, production, dissemination, and uptake of evidence in the context of clinical decision making\u2014led by John R Evans, Gordon Guyatt, Brian Haynes, and David Sackett\u2022The development of microencapsulated Sprinkles by Stanley Zlotkin in the 1990s as a novel means of providing micronutrient supplements to children\u2022The near elimination of chancroid (Haemophilus ducreyi) in sub-Saharan Africa through systematic control of sexually transmitted infections, led by Allan Ronald and colleagues since 2000\u2022The International Network of Indigenous Health Knowledge and Development, advancing health of Indigenous peoples in Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and the USA since 2003, co-led by Judith Bartlett (M\u00e9tis), Barry Lavallee (M\u00e9tis and Saulteaux Nation), Jeffrey Reading (Mohawk), and Deborah Schwartz (M\u00e9tis)\u2022Leadership on the development, evaluation, and implementation of new diagnostic technologies for low-income countries by Rosanna Peeling as Head of Diagnostics Research at the UNICEF-UNDP-World Bank-WHO Special Programme for research and training in Tropical Diseases (2003\u201308)\u2022The Teasdale-Corti Global Health Research Partnership Program (named for Canadian surgeon, Lucille Teasdale, and her husband, Piero Corti), which supported north\u2013south projects in Asia, Africa, the Middle East, Latin America, and the Caribbean (2005\u201313)\u2022The advancement of male circumcision for HIV prevention by Stephen Moses in 2007\u2022The creation of the Canada Gairdner Global Health Award in 2009 to honour a biomedical researchers affecting the health outcomes of populations in low-income and middle-income countries\u2022The lead role in the discovery of the VSV-EBOV vaccine to prevent Ebola virus disease by Heinz Feldmann and colleagues in 2015 at the Public Health Agency of Canada\n",

Ongoing nation building emphasises consensus building and equity in foreign policy, and relies on strong commitment to multilateralism.\u2022Canada's unique strengths in global health leadership draw from the country's legacy and contemporary challenges of building a multicultural society, maintaining a bilingual heritage, and reconciling the injustices inflicted on Indigenous peoples. Health equity has been a key focus.\u2022The quality of Canadian contributions to global health has been high, but impact has been diluted by a tendency to spread limited resources thinly, and by fragmentation among global health institutions, priorities, and policies in Canada.\u2022The previous Conservative federal government, led by Stephen Harper, adopted an approach to foreign policy that favoured technocratic solutions and tied global health initiatives to trade and investment opportunities benefiting Canada. It championed maternal and child health in the Millennium Development Goal era, but critics say this period was a sharp departure from traditional Canadian values of equity, human rights, and global citizenship.\u2022High expectations exist for the current Liberal government led by Justin Trudeau, which has signalled a return to these traditional Canadian values. Canada now has an important opportunity to assert much-needed global leadership, including in global health. Real policy change and concrete action on issues such as foreign aid assistance and Indigenous health inequities are urgently needed to demonstrate the credibility of the government's commitment to these values.\n\n",

            "text": "The role of Canada in global health is inextricably linked to the country's history of colonisation and nation building. Canada could have looked very different. The discovery of gold on the west coast in the 1850s put these colonised territories at risk of absorption by the larger USA to the south. A geopolitical race ensued to unite the British and French colonies from east to west as a single country, and fend off American land-grabbing ambitions. The enactment of the British North America Act (now known as the Constitution Act) in 1867, to form the Dominion of Canada, marked the beginning of a decades-long effort to integrate and unify the diverse elements that would form this new country. The Canadian Pacific Railway, completed in 1885 as a condition for British Columbia to join Confederation, formed the critical infrastructural backbone of this vast territory.4 As part of the colonisation process, the British Crown pressed Indigenous peoples to agree to 56 land treaties between 1760 and 1923, many of which are challenged today for their legality or questionable due process.5 Other traditional territories were simply occupied and remain unceded today. Domestic politics focused on balancing the interests of the English and the French\u2014while diminishing the power and rights of Indigenous peoples\u2014and integrating a steady inflow of immigrants who together formed the tapestry of the Canadian population.",

Middle powers achieve such impact by forming alliances, promoting shared norms, working cooperatively through multilateral channels, and engaging in diplomatic solutions. Although conducting foreign policy in this way can be more restrictive than unilateral action, in return, middle powers can exert greater influence on health and other global concerns than their material resources would normally allow.

Although the government's support for human rights initially required external pressure, individual Canadians had prominent roles in drafting the UN Charter, and in founding and leading the UN Division of Human Rights (including drafting and adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights).2 At the height of the Cold War, Minister of External Affairs (later Prime Minister from 1963 to 1968) Lester Pearson set the tone for Canada's role as an \u201chonest broker\u201d and \u201chelpful fixer\u201d.9 His use of quiet diplomacy to diffuse the Suez Canal crisis, and leadership in creating UN peacekeepers, earned him the Nobel Peace Prize in 1957.",

Canada's publicly funded, but largely privately delivered, health-care system straddles social and private medicine.3 Abroad, Canada's approach has mainly been to promote global health through multilateral cooperation, alliance building, and collective action (panel 2\n). The link between Canada's domestic interests and global citizenship is also well recognised; Canada is ranked the tenth most globalised country in the world, based on trade relations, population mobility, and openness.16 In advancing global health and equity, Canada's strategies have been fuelled by its long-standing commitments to multilateralism and global citizenship.Panel 2Canada's role as a middle power in global health\nAlliance building to assert greater influence on foreign policy\n\n\u2022Canada joins Australia, Italy, Norway, Sweden, and the UK to support a donor-led study of WHO reform of country offices (1996\u201397).10\n\u2022Canada initiates the Global Health Security Initiative with WHO and seven like-minded countries, as an informal partnership to strengthen public health preparedness and response to threats of biological, chemical, and radionuclear terrorism, and pandemic influenza (2001).11\n\u2022Canada, Norway, the USA, the World Bank, and UN co-launch the Global Financing Facility (GFF) in support of the Every Woman Every Child initiative. Canada contributes US$40 million to jumpstart a GFF\u2013IBRD (International Bank for Reconstruction and Development) partnership for community health workers and malaria control, which leverages funding from private capital markets (2015).12\n\u2022Canada contributes CAN$20 million at an international conference hosted by Belgium to replace the US$600 million cut to aid for abortion-related services by the Trump Administration (2017).\n\nCollective action through multilateral institutions to address shared problems\n\n\u2022Health Canada in partnership with WHO creates the Global Public Health Intelligence Network (GPHIN), an automated, multilingual, internet-based tool to rapidly detect, identify, assess, prevent, and mitigate threats to human health. GPHIN is headquartered in the Public Health Agency of Canada, and is a key data source for WHO Alert and Response Operations (2000).\u2022Canada actively participates in the revision of International Health Regulations after the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and establishes the Public Health Agency of Canada as a national focal point for compliance (2004).\u2022Canada hosts the Fifth Replenishment Conference of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, and increases its pledge by 20% to CAN$804 million for 2017\u201319, as an example of \u201cwhen we work together, we can truly transform the world\u201d (2016).13\n\n\nCompromise positions to resolve international disputes\n\n\u2022The Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) collaborates with the UK and co-hosts a meeting of diverse stakeholders to discuss models, including an Ottawa Fund, for a global mechanism to fund health issues. This process leads to the creation of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (2001).\n\nAssert leadership on non-security issue areas\n\n\u2022The Canadian Public Health Association, Health and Welfare Canada, and WHO co-sponsor the first International Conference on Health Promotion, which adopts the Ottawa Charter, calling for a comprehensive, multistrategy approach to health and wellbeing (1986).\u2022Canada introduces the idea of an international treaty on tobacco control at the World Health Assembly (WHA), arguing that a comprehensive, coordinated, and multifaceted approach is necessary. Finland and Ireland were persuaded to sponsor a WHA resolution to initiate the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, since Canada was not on the WHO Executive Board at the time (1998).14\n\u2022The Minister of Health and the Minister of Environment and Climate Change commit to addressing risks from chemicals to health and the environment by 2020, guided by a Chemicals Management Plan. The plan made Canada a world leader on safe chemicals management, including the adoption of a WHA resolution (2006).15\n\u2022Canada co-leads (with Tanzania) the Commission on Information and Accountability for Women's and Children's Health in support of Millennium Development Goals 4 and 5 (2010).\n\nActively promote human rights and rule of law as core norms in foreign policy\n\n\u2022Canada hosts a conference at which Foreign Affairs Minister Lloyd Axworthy challenges world leaders to adopt the Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on their Destruction, known as the Ottawa Treaty (1996).\u2022Canada becomes the first country to create detailed legislation, known as the Canadian Access to Medicines Regime, to enact the 2003 World Trade Organization decision allowing countries to use compulsory licences on pharmaceutical products to export affordable medicines to countries with an insufficient capacity to manufacture them (2005).\u2022Canada co-sponsors the UN Security Council resolution on protecting medical missions in compliance with international humanitarian law (2016).\n",

Many Canadians occupied prominent roles in health development over ensuing decades. In 1969, Pearson led the eight-member World Bank Commission on International Development, which produced the landmark report,17 Partners in Development, that, in citing moral imperative and enlightened national self-interest, urged high-income countries to increase overall official development aid (ODA; all forms of development assistance) to 0\u00b77% of their gross national product by 1975. Achieving recognition of this target epitomised the capacity of Canadians to use a middle-power voice to foster new norms. The Canadian Government's track record in adherence to such norms, however, has been chequered. Despite Canadian championing of the benchmark, Canada's own ODA commitments have lagged behind those of other countries that are members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), including middle powers such as Sweden. In 2016, Canada's net ODA (CAN$3\u00b796 billion) constituted 0\u00b726% of its gross national income, placing it 15th among 29 OECD countries, and well below the OECD average of 0\u00b740%.18\n",

During the early phase of expanded funding (1997\u20132008), the most prominent funding channels were Canadian bilateral assistance mechanisms (47\u00b77%), followed by UN bodies (27\u00b71%). Less than 5% of funding was channelled through non-governmental organisations and private foundations. From 2009 to 2016, substantially more funding went through international and Canadian non-governmental organisations and foundations (25\u00b73%), with a concomitant decrease in funding through Canada's bilateral assistance mechanisms (36\u00b76%) and UN bodies (15\u00b76%). One driver of this shift was Canada's large investment in the G8 Muskoka Initiative for Maternal, Newborn and Child Health, which was initiated in 2010. An analysis of financing patterns of the Muskoka Initiative for 2010\u201311 and 2012\u201313 estimated that the largest share of funding (47%) was channelled through foreign non-profit organisations, including multilateral partners, UN agencies, and international non-governmental organisations,21 whereas approximately 16% of the CAN$2\u00b785 billion commitment was channelled through Canadian non-governmental organisations.21 How Canada channels its global health funding has important implications for the future. The shift in funding from bilateral mechanisms to large, global, issue-oriented priorities, such as the Muskoka Initiative, can sharpen the focus of Canada's role in global health, but this narrowed scope might constrain responsiveness to local priorities.",

This theme has been pursued through the middle-power behaviours of collective action, leadership on non-security issues, and promotion of human rights norms. Health equity is concerned with disparities in health that are systematic, avoidable, and unfair; that is, where differences in health have social, economic, or political causes as opposed to biological causes.22, 23 Concern for health equity goes beyond the health system to include structural causes of health disparities, often framed as the social determinants of health. In Canada, the domestic experience of creating a system of universal health coverage based on the principle of equity has been central to nation building.3 A key moment in this process occurred in 1974 when the landmark Lalonde Report24 (named for then-Minister of National Health and Welfare, Marc Lalonde) emphasised the role of both biological and social factors as health determinants. The Lalonde Report is credited with advancing health promotion and public health domestically, and for setting the global stage for adoption of the WHO Alma-Ata Declaration on primary health care in 1978.25\n",

Building on the Commission's finding of inequitable funding and the fragmentation of international efforts, WHO passed a resolution at the 43rd World Health Assembly recommending greater funding and better coordination to support LMIC researchers to enable them to do essential national health research. Despite leadership by Canadians on the Commission, the Canadian Government was slow to respond to these recommendations.32 However, since 2000, funding by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR)\u2014the main federal funder of health research in Canada, akin to the US National Institutes of Health\u2014for global health has increased from less than CAN$3 million to more than $30 million.

Funds channelled through the World Bank's International Development Agency increased. In 2013, the government announced a 30% increase in Canada's 3-year pledge to the Global Fund to Fight Tuberculosis, AIDS and Malaria. At the same time, the government scuppered a G20 initiative to create a financial transaction tax as an innovative funding mechanism for global development, which had been proposed by former UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown. Perhaps most visibly, Canada hosted the G8 Summit in 2010, where Harper announced the Muskoka Initiative on Maternal, Newborn and Child Health along with CAN$2\u00b785 billion of funding. This focus was complemented later in 2010 by Harper's role as co-chair (with Tanzanian President Jakaya Mrisho Kikwete) of the UN Commission on Information and Accountability for Women's and Children's Health.67 The Muskoka Initiative was extended for another 5 years (and a further $3\u00b75 billion was pledged) in 2014, earning high-profile praise for Canadian leadership from Melinda Gates and UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon.68 The initiative was positively welcomed in some UN circles at a time of flagging funding for global health. Canada's leadership on accountability and establishment of an independent oversight mechanism for Millennium Development Goals 4 and 5 was also welcomed. Others argued that the initiative overemphasised the need for health-care services for women and children to survive, and gave insufficient attention to the root causes of maternal mortality, including reproductive rights of women and girls.30, 69\n",

In 2010, the unprecedented rejection of Canada's bid to serve a seventh time as a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council was described as an embarrassment and was an indication of how far the country's standing had fallen in the eyes of the world.75\n",

This diversity also arises from Canada's two official languages (English and French) as well as the one-fifth of Canadians born abroad. At the crossroads of unprecedented global population mobility, Canada has worked hard to prevent the levels of social tension found in other countries and to achieve a remarkable degree of social cohesion. Diversity is formally recognised and protected in Canada through relatively extensive settlement services, social rights, and protections against discrimination. At a time when many Europeans are declaring multiculturalism a failure, and the vision of an interconnected world is under political retreat, the Canadian experience offers important lessons.82 Canadians with lived experience of such diversity should be nurtured as valued assets for their leadership skills, cultural sensitivity, and openness of perspective that are ideal for advancing global health equity. Yet there is little room for complacency. Canada ranked third in the world on the Migrant Integration Policy Index until 2015, but then dropped to sixth after changes that restricted immigration and refugee policy by the former Conservative government.83, 84 Under the current Liberal government, planned increases in immigration, including from countries listed on the US Trump Administration's travel ban, will require ongoing and concerted efforts at nation building. Canada has been far from immune from the social tensions felt in other countries. Although hate crimes in Canada declined between 2012 and 2015, police-reported hate crimes targeting Muslims more than tripled during this period.85 Thus, how successfully Canadians address social cohesion at home will form the foundation for an expanded role internationally. Canada's capacity and credibility, as a global health leader, derive directly from how well diversity and inclusion are championed at home.",

At the top of the country's priorities is \u201ctrue, meaningful, and lasting reconciliation between Canada and First Nations, Inuit, and M\u00e9tis peoples\u201d.86 This long-overdue task begins with taking responsibility for past and continued social exclusion of, discrimination against, and state-sanctioned policies inflicted on Indigenous peoples, as embodied in the Indian Act,87 passed in 1867 and still law today, which is far-reaching legislation designed to restrict and control the rights, movement, and cultural practices of Indigenous peoples in Canada. For example, the Indian Act created reserves, imposed a band council system of governance, forbade First Nations from speaking their languages, denied First Nations the right to vote, and forbade First Nations from forming political organisations. The Indian Act also introduced the infamous Indian Residential School system, in operation from the 1940s until 1996, which was a key tool in the cultural genocide of Indigenous peoples by forcibly removing Indigenous children from their families at a young age and relocating them to state-run and church-run institutions, where they were subjected to assimilation to European culture as well as profound levels of physical, sexual, and emotional abuse.7 Historically embedded and institutionalised forms of racism remain the root causes of stark, multigenerational inequities in Indigenous health status.88 Although ostensibly a domestic issue, the extent to which Canadians genuinely understand and redress this colonial legacy will define the authenticity of Canada's voice on the global stage, including leadership and policy making that will influence other governments and international agencies' work to improve health equity for the 370 million Indigenous people living across more than 70 countries.89 At home, this improvement begins with full implementation of the 94 recommendations of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada, including seven that are directly related to health, including funding for Indigenous health centres, and implementation of the health rights of Indigenous people in international law, constitutional law, and treaties previously negotiated with the Government of Canada.7 Canada should mirror these actions abroad by increasing global health funding to promote solidarity among Indigenous peoples in their pursuit of commitments under the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, notably Article 24 on the attainment of physical and mental health. The government should also renew the CIHR's recently expired Tripartite Cooperation Agreement to Improve Indigenous Peoples' Health, with the National Health and Medical Research Council in Australia and the Health Research Council of New Zealand.90 Renewal should include a considerable scale-up of investment for research, mentorship, and knowledge synthesis driven by Indigenous leaders, and the inclusion of additional countries in the cooperation agreement.",

The country's own pursuit of a Canada-first agenda under the Harper Government demonstrated the false dichotomy between global citizenship and advancement of domestic interests. Indeed, evidence suggests that the prioritisation of aid, to maximise trade and investment returns, or to fund only research with direct benefits to Canadians, has been counterproductive. As well as detrimental to poverty reduction abroad, instrumental approaches to foreign policy reflect a limited view of Canadian interests. Instead, the lesson for Canada is that domestic and global interests are deeply intertwined, and best served by equity-based approaches.91 Thus, Canada's health interests are better served through collective action to support health system strengthening, effective health policies, and health workforce capacity in all countries. This collective action includes Canada adhering to and advocating others to commit to the WHO Global Code of Practice on the International Recruitment of Health Personnel, the International Health Regulations,92 UN treaties,93 human rights instruments,94 development assistance commitments,79 and other international obligations. Moreover, Canada should continue to champion the social determinants of health approach, which is focused on reduction of poverty and health inequalities as well as ensuring basic needs, as a strategy for countering the health inequalities created by economic globalisation\u2014ie, market-based restructuring of the world economy since the 1990s. For example, the government should support improved accountability mechanisms (eg, ombudspersons, report cards, and complaint processes) to address the health harms arising from Canadian corporate interests in the extractive sector at home and abroad. To this end, Canada should benchmark the impacts of its foreign and development policies, as a whole, on global health equity against other progressive middle powers such as Norway.95\n",

            "text": "The importance given to inclusiveness and consensus building in Canada has led to resources being spread thinly, and an exceptional degree of fragmentation, across Canadian institutions concerned with global health. Weak coordination has led to a lack of clear strategic priorities and action plans, along with missed opportunities to act more decisively with available resources. This lack of coordination is apparent across government departments at the federal and provincial levels, and among the policy, practitioner, and research communities. Canada's main contributions to global health comprise health development activities led by Global Affairs Canada (formerly the Department of Foreign Affairs, Trade and Development); technical and policy responses overseen by Health Canada and the Public Health Agency of Canada; and global health research supported primarily by CIHR, IDRC, and Grand Challenges Canada. This fragmentation and the lack of coordinating mechanisms undermine Canada's overall impact. A Canadian global health strategy should be developed along similar lines to that of the UK,96 Switzerland,97 Japan,98 and other countries99 as a unifying vision of Canada's engagement in global health efforts.30, 100, 101 Mechanisms such as knowledge platforms, strategic partnerships, and inter-agency coordinating bodies should be created to amplify Canadian efforts. Central to this approach should be a revived and improved version of the former GHRI, whereby substantial common resources are available to government entities to encourage alignment of their activities around shared global health priorities. The framework for improved coordination should include investment in the global health-related activities of Canadian universities and civil society organisations to facilitate high-impact partnerships. It should also include commitment to a career path within Canada by establishing training and support for an interprofessional cadre of global-minded health professionals to respond to the international regard for Canadian values and amplify the benefits arising from the country's diversity.87, 88 Overall, this framework should emphasise resource allocation guided by the outcomes it produces for beneficiaries, and the principles of alignment, ownership, and harmonisation of the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness and Accra Agenda for Action.102\n",

Prime Minister Trudeau's personable qualities and progressive statements about immigration, gender equality, and climate change have created expectations of elevated Canadian leadership on the world stage. The plans for Canada to seek a return to the UN Security Council in 2021, as a non-permanent member, reflect these ambitions. However, assuming this mantle will require more than persuasive words. Indeed, concerns are growing about the sincerity of the Liberal government's commitment to progressive ideas, given a perceived disconnect between the Prime Minister's words and government actions. For example, no new funding accompanied the ambitious Feminist International Assistance Policy, by contrast with the national defence strategy announced the same week.77, 105 Furthermore, nearly 2 years into Trudeau's mandate, the government has yet to reverse historically low levels of Canadian development aid.79 The government should use its presidency of the G7 in 2018 as a platform for backing its words with concrete actions\u2014and should call on other G7 governments to follow suit\u2014framed around achieving the Sustainable Development Goals.",

The political forging of the country came at a considerable price, notably to Indigenous peoples, and the country has learned hard lessons about the importance of inclusion and equity. Moreover, Canada's unique history continues to unfold. Authentically reconciling its relationship with Indigenous peoples, maintaining social cohesion amid diversity, and successfully meeting domestic needs while remaining open to globalisation will be integral to the country's next 150 years. Against this backdrop, Canada is uniquely positioned to become a more prominent global health leader by harnessing its distinct experiences, diverse assets, and core values. Like the country itself, Canada's role in global health remains a work in progress.",
