            "text": "Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), a coronavirus, is one of the foremost causes of economic losses within the poultry industry, affecting the performance of both meat-providing and egg-laying chickens (Cavanagh, 2007, De Wit et al., 2011). The major reason for the high profile of IBV is due to the existence of a very large number of serotypes, although the virus is also highly contagious. In order to control the disease in poultry, both live and inactivated IB vaccines are used extensively. The nature of the protective immune response to IBV is poorly understood, but research has demonstrated that the surface spike protein, and particularly the amino-terminal S1 portion, is sufficient to induce good protective immunity. There is increasing evidence that only a few amino acid differences amongst S proteins are sufficient to have a detrimental impact on cross-protection (Cavanagh, 2007). As it is not always clear which serotype is responsible for any health problems in poultry, combinations of vaccines are widely used to generate broad protection (Terregino et al., 2008). Another possibility is to use vaccines which contain a combination of different vaccine viral strains. Zoetis is marketing a live combination vaccine for chickens named Poulvac\u00ae IB Primer. This lyophilized vaccine contains two attenuated infectious bronchitis strains, IB H120 (MacDonald and McMartin, 1976) and IB D274 (Kusters et al., 1987). Both vaccine strains have been attenuated by passage in embryonated chicken eggs, which is the usual method for attenuation of infectious bronchitis viruses and development of vaccines (MacDonald and McMartin, 1976, Klieve and Cummings, 1988, Jackwood et al., 2003, Liu et al., 2007). In order to quantify the viral content of the vaccine, dilution series of the final product are inoculated in 10 days embryonated chicken eggs. After the incubation period the eggs are opened and the embryos removed for examination of IB specific lesions. The product titre defined is the reciprocal value of the dilution causing embryonal lesions in 50% of the eggs. For the combination vaccine Poulvac\u00ae IB Primer the result is a cumulative titre to which both IB strains contribute. In order to titrate both virus strains separately, strain specific neutralizing antisera have been tested. It has been shown that antiserum against strain IB D274 does not cross-react with strain IB H120 (Kusters et al., 1987) and it was speculated that antiserum against IB H120 would not cross react with strain IB D274. However, during titration experiments it was determined that the antiserum against IB H120 strongly reacted with IB D274. PCR has been used successfully to detect IB strains in various samples and it appeared to be possible to distinguish IB strains, including IB H120 and IB D274, based on their reactivity with primers specific for the various strains (Worthington et al., 2008). Here, we took advantages of the genomic level differences between the two IB strains and describe a PCR based approach to quantify the titres of each IB virus strain contained in the Poulvac IB vaccine.",

After 1 day incubation eggs with dead embryos were considered nonspecific deaths and discarded. After an incubation period of 7 days the eggs were opened and the allantoic fluid harvested and stored at \u221270 \u00b0C. The embryos were removed and examined for the presence of specific lesions caused by the virus, i.e. dwarfing, curling and stunting of the embryo. Dead embryos were considered positive for IBV.

Taq-mix and 2\u00d7 buffer had been obtained from the Super script One Step Reverse Transcriptase PCR Kit (Invitrogen, Bleiswijk, The Netherlands). For one sample 45 \u03bcl of this mixture was added to a PCR tube containing 5.0 \u03bcl of the RNA sample. 5.0 \u03bcl of PCR grade water was used instead in case of a negative control. The primers for the strains IB H120 and IB D274 and the size of the PCR products are indicated in Table 1\n. The tubes were placed in the PCR machine (Thermocycler, MJ Research PTC-200, Bio-Rad, Veenendaal, The Netherlands) and the following steps were programmed: cDNA synthesis 30 min at 50 \u00b0C, initial denaturation 10 min at 95 \u00b0C, 30 cycles of 30 s at 95 \u00b0C, 30 s at 50 \u00b0C, 45 s at 72 \u00b0C. Final extension was 7 min at 72 \u00b0C and reaction stop 5 min at 4 \u00b0C. The formation of PCR product was assessed by agarose gel electrophoresis. First the gel was prepared. TBE buffer was prepared by 10-fold dilution of a solution with 1.0 M Tris, 0.9 M boric acid, 0.01 M EDTA in water. Agarose was added to a concentration of 2% to the TBE buffer and ethydium bromide to a final concentration of 0.5 \u03bcg per ml. The gel was allowed to solidify and used for electrophoresis of the PCR samples. The samples were allowed to go through the gel for 2 h at 70 V. A basepair ladder was used to determine the size of the bands in the agarose gel. Gel electrophoresis was stopped when separation of the different bands in the base pair ladder was satisfactory. Bands were made visible by ultraviolet illumination.",

            "text": "Numerous publications are available in which viral titrations and possible issues have been described. For several viruses tissue culture methods can be used, in which a positive response can be observed by examination of monolayers of cells for the presence of a cytopathogenic effect (Heldt et al., 2006). If the virus does not form a cytopathogenic effect, the presence of live virus in the culture can be demonstrated by methods using colour agents (Heldt et al., 2006) or specific antibodies (Zielinska et al., 2005, Yap and Lam, 1994). For avian viruses suitable substrates are needed and sometimes there are different possibilities (Nicholas et al., 1986). For titrations in embryonated eggs the presence of the virus in allantoic fluid can be tested using a specific property of the virus, for example its ability to cause haemagglutination (Klimov et al., 2012). The presence or absence of lesions on the embryos also can be used to determine the presence of live virus, such as has been demonstrated for IB viruses (De Wit, 2000). The use of PCR for screening samples from titrations for the presence of virus has not been described previously. Initially PCR was used mainly for testing for the presence of viruses or other infectious agents in samples (Tafuro et al., 1996). Currently, with the introduction of real time PCR it is possible to determine quantities of virus particles in samples (Hiroshi Kimura et al., 1999, Isabel Costafreda et al., 2006, Spackman and Suarez, 2008). Because of its specificity it is possible also to detect more than one virus strain in one test using PCR (Van Elden et al., 2001).",

Based on the results of the PCR we determined whether an allantoic fluid was positive for one or both of the viruses or not, and as such we were able to define a separate endpoint in the live virus titration for each of the two strains. It has to be clear that this is not the same as a quantitative PCR. In a quantitative PCR the number of genomic fragments is determined based on the number of cycles in the real time PCR required for a positive response. In such a PCR genomic fragments coming from live as well as \u2018dead\u2019 virus particles are determined. In the test described in this paper we determined whether an egg was positive for the presence of virus coming from a productive infection using PCR with a fixed number of cycles. Only a live virus particle can cause a productive infection. If the egg would have been inoculated with a dead virus particle, it would not have given a positive response in the PCR.",
