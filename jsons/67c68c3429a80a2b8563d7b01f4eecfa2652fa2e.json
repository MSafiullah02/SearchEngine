Studying patient flow in a hospital is particularly fundamental as it demonstrates effectiveness and efficiency of a hospital. Since hospital is a collection of physically nearby services under one administration, its performance and outcome are shaped by the interaction of its discrete components. Coordination of processes at different levels of organizational structure of a hospital can be studied using network analysis. Hence, this article presents a data-driven static and temporal network of departments. Both networks are directed and weighted and constructed using seven years' (2010-2016) empirical data of 24902 Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) patients. The ties reflect an episode-based transfer of ACS patients from department to department in a hospital. The weight represents the number of patients transferred among departments. As a result, the underlying structure of network of departments that deliver healthcare for ACS patients is described, the main departments and their role in the diagnosis and treatment process of ACS patients are identified, the role of departments over seven years is analyzed and communities of departments are discovered. The results of this study may help hospital administration to effectively organize and manage the coordination of departments based on their significance, strategic positioning and role in the diagnosis and treatment process which, in-turn, nurtures value-based and precision healthcare.",

Nowadays, healthcare administrative data have been widely used to demonstrate SNA [5] . According to [5] [6] and [12] , the standard practice to construct network of healthcare providers (healthcare professionals) is based on \"patient-sharing\" concept meaning; two providers are considered to be connected to one another if they both deliver care to the same patient. To do so, first, bipartite network of patient-physician should be created. Next, this bipartite network can be projected to unipartite network of physicians only, where the ties reflect patient-sharing between physicians. For instance, Soulakis et al [5] made an attempt to visualize and describe collaborative electronic health record (EHR) usage for hospitalized patients with heart failure by creating 2 types of networks: the first is a directed bipartite network which represents interactions between providers and patient records and the second network is undirected and depicts shared patient record access between providers. In 2018, Onnela et al [12] have compared standard methods for constructing physician networks from patient-physician encounter data with a new method based on clinical episodes of care using data on 100% of traditional Medicare beneficiaries from 51 regions for the years 2005-2010.",

Patient-ID has been commonly used to construct network of providers [6] . However, one patient may have many episodes in different time period and departments providing care to a patient in the context of one clinical episode may not be directly connected to another clinical episode [12] . In this case, the standard approach based on patient-ID would produce a network that does not correspond to the real connections.

The number of patients transferred between departments was employed as a weight. i.e., the proposed network is both directed as well as weighted graph.

Both degree and weighted degree distributions (see Fig. 1 ) are positively skewed with a large majority of departments having a low degree and a small number of departments having a high degree. This shows that network of departments are scale free [16] meaning; there are few departments that are highly connected to other departments in the diagnosis and treatment process of ACS patients. The average degree and weighted degree account for 19 and 5800, in that order. This means that one department has an interaction with 19 departments on average by transferring or receiving 5800 patients on average over seven years. Even though the network of departments is sparse with density equals to 0.1, the average path length is short which accounts for 2.3. i.e., a given department may reach other departments in the network with 2.3 hops on average. Out of 227 departments in the static network, 27 departments are strongly connected meaning; 27 departments are connected to each other by at least one path and have no connections with the rest of the network. When we see the strategic positioning of departments in the static network, Regular Laboratory department, Emergency Laboratory1 department and Functional Diagnostic department are receiving more requests as well as sending more results to other departments (see Table 1 ). In addition to this, cardiology departments, ICU departments and heart surgery departments are also vital in the diagnosis and treatment processes of ACS patients. This shows that ACS requires intensive diagnosis and treatment procedures and care. These departments are significant in terms of giving support to and influencing activities of other departments. Therefore, maintaining the functionality, capacity and geographical proximity of these departments is vital so as to deliver effective and efficient healthcare for ACS patients.",

For instance, these departments may serve as a hub for posting notices to patients as well as staff members of the hospital, hosting awareness creation activities, placing shared resources and propagating technology transfer projects. Five communities of departments (see Fig. 2 ) with different proportion (C1 (Violet) = 37.4%, C2 (Green) = 27.6%, C3 (Azure) = 19%, C4 (Orange)= 14% and C5 (Forest) = 4%) were identified using modularity and community extraction algorithm proposed by Blondel et al [24] .

In this section, analysis of the structure of network of departments and the role of departments over seven years is discussed. The node size in the network increases from year to year (see Table 3 ) which may indicate an introduction of new departments (e.g., emergency laboratory 2, see Fig. 4 ) or technologies or a change in working process that allow existing departments to engage actively in the diagnosis and treatment process. As the node size increases, the edge size also increases with positive correlation coefficient of 0.94 (see Figure 3 ). There is also positive correlation between edge size and average degree with a correlation coefficient of 0.76. Besides to this, modularity has a positive correlation with node size, edge size, Average Path Length (APL), and the number of strongly connected components. The strongly connected components (which refer to a sub-graphs in which all the departments are connected to each other by at least one path and have no connections with the rest of the graph [16] ) also increases over time which was 9 in 2010 and became 23 in 2016.
