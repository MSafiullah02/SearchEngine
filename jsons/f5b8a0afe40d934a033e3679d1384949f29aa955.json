The dates during which COVID-19 was diagnosed for the 28 case subjects are listed along the timeline. The horizontal axis includes the dates between January 10, 2020 and March 5, 2020. Two key time points were marked: A, January 20, 2020 when the Chinese government first announced human-to-human transmission; B, January 23, 2020 when Wuhan was locked down by government mandate. Each subject is represented by a vertical line represents marked with a case number. Ophthalmologists, ophthalmic nurses, and ophthalmic technicians were labeled black, red, and blue, respectively. The length of each vertical line indicates disease severity: short, mild disease; medium; severe disease; long, death. The majority of cases (85.7%) were diagnosed between the middle of January and early February. Figure 1B . The geographic locations of 10 hospitals where eye professionals contracted COVID-19. The hospitals were labeled A through J and marked as red circles. The radius of each circle is proportional to the incidence of COVID-19 among eye professionals in each hospital; higher incidence corresponding with a larger circle. The Huanan Seafood market, the believed origin of Wuhan COVID-19 epidemic, is also labeled in the map. The hospitals with the highest incidences (hospitals E and G) were clustered within 4.5 kilometer of the Huanan Seafood market. Although hospital B, a small eye institution located in proximity to this market, had a much lower incidence than hospitals E and G, hospital E's incidence was still higher than a similarly-sized eye institution more distant from the market (hospital C).", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1334, "end": 1343, "text": "Figure 1B", "ref_id": null}], "section": ""}], "bib_entries": {"BIBREF0": {"ref_id": "b0", "title": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pandemic", "authors": [], "year": null, "venue": "", "volume": "", "issn": "", "pages": "", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF1": {"ref_id": "b1", "title": "National Health Commission of the PRC, National Administration of Traditional 150", "authors": [], "year": null, "venue": "", "volume": "", "issn": "", "pages": "", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF2": {"ref_id": "b2", "title": "Chinese Medicine of the PRC.

First, providers with sCOVID-19 were identified 132 through contact with Key Informants.

Thus, 134 results from this study only applied to symptomatic COVID-19 among eye 135 professionals.
