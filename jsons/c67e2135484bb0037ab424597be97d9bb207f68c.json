[28] Visits by adults to primary-care physicians for cough in the US Clinical studies, randomized, controlled trials and subsequent are very common and have increased from 5.5 million office visits meta-analyses examining the role of antibacterials in patients with in 1980 to 10.2 million in 1994. [17] Most of these patients are acute bronchitis have found them to be of little meaningful clinical women (60%) and 75% are younger than 65 years of age. Acute benefit. [29, 30] A recent Cochrane review which included over 750 bronchitis accounts for approximately 42% of these visits, about patients aged 8 years and older from nine trials found that, at 75% of ambulatory antibacterial prescriptions and about 11% of follow-up, patients who received antibacterials for acute bronchi-This is not to say that antibacterials are never indicated in the treatment of acute bronchitis. [34] There will be a proportion of patients, about 20%, where the physician is confident that antibacterials are indicated, usually because of the presence of factors such as focal chest signs, older age of patient and coexisting disease and generally how ill the patient appears. [35, 36] Some pregnant patients may wish to avail themselves of overthe-counter cough suppressants for symptom control even though there is currently no good evidence for their effectiveness. [37] Dextromethorphan, an active ingredient in many antitussive remedies, has been hypothesized, in a study in chick embryos, to be associated with neural tube defects. However, this risk has not been substantiated by a recent case-control study involving 184 pregnant women, 128 of whom were exposed to dextromethorphan in the first trimester. [38] There were six (3.2%) major malformations in the study group compared with five (2.7%) in the control group. No cases of neural tube defects were reported in the study group. This study had 80% power to detect a 3.5-fold increase in the rate of malformations. Other theoretical concerns regarding postnatal neurodevelopment have been raised but as yet remain untested. Therefore, based on current knowledge, there is no good evidence to either support or discourage the routine use of cough suppressants for symptom control in non-pneumonic LRTI Totals are greater than 100% because of the identification of more than one pathogen in some individuals. Tests for Chlamydiae pneumoniae were not performed in studies on patients with LRTI and in ambulatory patients with community-acquired pneumonia (ambulatory CAP). CAP (ambulatory) [26] patients showed symptoms of LRTI with focal chest signs; CAP (hospital) [27] patients showed symptoms of LRTI with radiographic confirmation of pneumonic shadowing; LRTi [15] was defined as an acute illness in a previously well patient with cough as the cardinal symptom and at least one other lower respiratory tract symptom and LRTI [16] was defined as the presence of productive cough associated with another symptom or sign of LRTI plus constitutional symptoms and prescription of antibiotics for the illness.",

[84] These patients reported significantly more One of the main challenges in diagnosing pneumonia during pregnancy is differentiating between respiratory symptoms related to physiological changes and those related to disease. Dyspnea, in particular, is common during pregnancy. It is experienced by 50% of women at 19 weeks gestation and up to 76% at 31 weeks. [81] Physiologic dyspnea characteristically begins early in pregnancy and improves or plateaus as term approaches. It does not usually interfere with daily activities and rarely occurs at rest. Clinical experience and a high index of suspicion are therefore crucial in identifying patients with disproportionate dyspnea in whom pneumonia must be considered. Associated cough should arouse clinical suspicion of an underlying cause. Clinical examination may reveal abnormal chest signs. However, a firm diagnosis of pneumonia can be made only with the aid of a chest radiograph. Therefore, given the appropriate clinical scenario, the risk of misdiagnosing pneumonia is greater than the small risk from radiation exposure. [82] The differential diagnosis of alveolar shadowing on a chest x-ray in the context of pregnancy includes noncardiogenic pulmonary edema in preeclampsia and eclampsia, pulmonary edema secondary to tocolytic agents, aspiration pneumonitis and, rarely, choriocarcinoma with pulmonary metastases. [83] Such conditions are rare in the first trimester and an argument could be made for not performing chest x-rays at this stage in a pregnant woman who presents with the clinical features Table II .

Currently, there are few data to indicate that communityacquired LRTI present differently or are more severe during pregnancy. However, pregnancy poses special concerns regarding the risks from adverse drug effects. In general, management strategies developed for nonpregnant patients apply equally well to pregnant patients. Antibiotic options are more limited and in all instances, the benefits of antibiotic use must be weighed carefully against their risks and adverse effects. A summary of the safety of selected antimicrobials in pregnancy is provided in table IV. Key to authors' classification: \u2713 = adverse effects may have been shown in preclinical animal studies but published human studies do not show any adverse effects; \u25b2 = animal studies have revealed adverse effects in the fetus and there are no controlled studies to determine risk; \u00d7 = positive evidence of fetal risk but the benefits from use in pregnancy may be acceptable despite the risk; B = animal studies do not indicate a risk to the fetus and there are no controlled human studies, or animal studies do show an adverse effect on the fetus but well controlled studies in pregnant women have failed to demonstrate a risk to the fetus; C = studies have shown that the drug exerts animal teratogenic or embryocidal effects, but there are no controlled studies in women, or no studies are available in either animals or women; D = positive evidence of human fetal risk exists, but benefits in certain situations (e.g. life-threatening situations or serious diseases for which safer drugs cannot be used or are ineffective) may make use of the drug acceptable despite its risks.",
