AIDS, similarly, is the most prominent entity co-occurring with risk in 1987, with potentially higher peaks outside of the data sampling period. This shows that health and scandal, and health-related scandals, in particular, have great potential to influence short-term frequencies of risk communication. It also proves a clear difference between short-term risk hypes as in the case of the Vioxx scandal and long-term issues that feed into a lasting and only slowly decreasing level of RISK in media coverage as in the case of AIDS. With the character of AIDS changing from an acute deadly infectious disease to a manageable chronic illness, risk words co-occurring alongside the condition are decreasing in usage (Berridge 1996). We will examine the difference of the character of risk in the following.",

Similar issues such as the SARS outbreak in Southern China (2002\u20132003), as well as other zoonotic diseases, repeatedly feed into the concerns about a large epidemic, similar to the 1918 Spanish flu, which cost millions of people their lives. Organisations such as the WHO suggested that it is not a question of whether an infectious disease such as the Spanish flu would hit again, but simply when (Woolf 2014). AIDS was such a case of an (inter)national emergency, where potentially everyone was at-risk of transmission (though of course, groups such as gay men and blood transfusion recipients were especially vulnerable). But over the years, in the Western world, AIDS has been managed successfully and thereby increasingly lost newsworthiness. The recent Ebola virus epidemic (2013\u20132016) is a recent warning that infectious diseases still pose a threat. There were major concerns that the virus could spread in the Western world; however, Ebola remained mainly endemic to West Africa. As a result, it did not become an ongoing major news event in Western news coverage.",

For example, in Fig. 5.3, cancer and cholesterol and, in Fig. 5.4, lung cancer do not show clear trajectories.

He suggests that the shift towards risk cannot be explained by a change in terminology only. Instead, he hypothesised that the risk shift results from a particular social culture that developed historically and is linked to the development of probability statistics, to a focus on risk management and to health promotion and computer technology.

The nominal group RISK FACTOR stands for the notion of health and illness being influenced by a range of distinct variables, which together affect the likelihood of a negative outcome such as illness or disease. For example, smoking, drinking and unhealthy diet are all risk factors increase the likelihood of heart disease. It is important to note that for a generalised worldview, it is not necessary that the actual risk factors and their influence are objectively known or calculable but that it is expected that such factors exist and could at least theoretically be identified.",

We argue, referring to Weber, that even when the particular science might be weak or not reported in detail, the particular framework of reporting would use the notion of risk to make sense of possible harm.

However, media studies have emphasised that the organisational and broader economic conditions of news production are important elements for understanding the production of news (Herman and Chomsky 1988; Philo 2007\n). Institutional changes in news production such as growing concentration and competition with online (social) media during recent decades have had a potentially profound effect on the genre and subgenres of traditional print journalism. News are increasingly produced with increased time pressures, for global, online consumption, often with heavy budget constraints. Reports on particular issues such as new technologies, health and illness or social policy often build on general journalistic expertise rather than specialised journalism. When time is limited, journalists might rely on information provided by sources considered trustworthy in general, such as scientific experts and scientific research (Grundmann and Scott 2014\n). Foreseeably, an increased reliance on provided reports and press releases could result in an increasingly scientised style of news journalism. In a similar vein, it could be argued that specialised journalists would become part of the epistemic communities focused on issues such as climate change. Consequently, specialised journalists would increasingly use language practices typical of the particular epistemic community they are part of.",

Showing the \u2018human face\u2019 of suffering, making links to personal experiences, and/or showing that everyone could be affected and other dimensions have each been highlighted as being central for both successfully constructing social problems (Loseke 2003) and newsworthiness (Kitzinger 1999\n). Health researchers have shown that good health is often considered as normal\u2014an assumption which is often not much reflected upon until it is challenged. A diagnosis of a chronic illness is therefore experienced as a biographical disruption which questions generalised expectations of health and requires a reordering of one\u2019s identity and biography (Bury 1982\n).

We found only 647 instantiation of words as riskers in the health corpus, which is 0.03% of all words in the health corpus. While this is an important finding in and of itself, it had serious consequences for the remainder of our analysis: the frequency of grammatical risking in the health subcorpus is so low that longitudinal change could not reliably be quantified.

It includes, for example, SECTOR, STRATEGY or NATION.

In this respect, women do not differ from men and other social groups in the health sector.

Even though news hype regarding infectious diseases take place from time to time, the larger and increasing body of the news mobilising risk languages refers to chronic and civilisation illnesses. We found an indication for a changing worldview in risk reporting, as well as a larger body of news coverage referring to scientific research. Thereby, two developments seem to complement one another: first, a changing culture in the understanding of health and illness which rests on a rationalist epidemiological worldview (Skolbekken 1995); second is a growing pressure and need to produce legitimate news\u2014a process that involves building on trustworthy evidence such as scientific research (Beck 1992\n). Finally, we found that active risking/risk taking is clearly underrepresented in the health domain. Only about 3.7% of all riskers in the general corpus are in the health domain, an almost negligible number. At the same time, children are a group which is strongest connected to the at-risk construct. CHILD is leading in the health corpus as well as in the general corpus reflecting the major social concern about children. Altogether, the health corpus shows a broader spread of at-risk status across different general people categories including man, woman, people and population indicating that the general concern about women is not expressed through the at-risk compound.",
