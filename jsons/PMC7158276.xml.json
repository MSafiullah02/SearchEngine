            "text": "At one end of each membranous semicircular duct is a dilation called the ampulla. On one side of the membranous ampulla, a proliferation of connective tissue forms a transverse ridge called the crista (see Figure 12-1, Figure 12-2, Figure 12-3). It is lined on its internal surface by columnar neuroepithelial cells. On the surface of the crista is a gelatinous structure that is composed of a protein-polysaccharide material called the cupula, which extends across the lumen of the ampulla. This neuroepithelium is composed of two basic cell types: hair cells and supporting cells. The neurons of the vestibulocochlear nerve are derived from otic placode ectoderm. The dendritic zones of the neurons of the vestibular portion of the vestibulocochlear nerve are in synaptic contact with the base of the hair cells. These hair cells have on their luminal surface 40 to 80 hairs, or modified microvilli (stereocilia), and a single modified cilium (kinocilium). These structures project into the overlying cupula. Movement of fluid in the semicircular ducts causes deflection of the cupula, which is oriented transversely to the direction of flow of the endolymph. This deflection bends the stereocilia, which is the source of the stimulus by way of the hair cells to the dendritic zone of the vestibular neuron that is in synaptic relationship with the plasmalemma of the hair cell.",

            "text": "The vestibular neurons are tonically active, and their activity is excited or inhibited by deflection of the cupula in different directions. Each semicircular duct on one side is paired with a semicircular duct on the opposite side by their common position in a parallel plane. These synergistic pairs are the left and right lateral ducts, the left anterior and right posterior ducts, and the left posterior and right anterior ducts. When movement in the direction of one of these three planes stimulates the vestibular neurons of the crista of one duct, they are inhibited in the opposite duct of the synergistic pair. For example, rotation of the head to the right causes the endolymph to flow in the right lateral duct such that the cupula is deflected toward the utriculus and the cupula of the left lateral duct is deflected away from the utriculus. This action causes increased activity of vestibular neurons on the right side and decreased activity on the left side, resulting in a jerk nystagmus to the right side, which is an involuntary rhythmic oscillation of the eyes. The anatomic orientation of the stereocilia relative to the kinocilium on the surface of the crista is responsible for the difference in activity relative to the direction of the cupula deflection. Deviation of the stereocilia toward the kinocilium increases vestibular neuron activity. These receptors are not affected by a constant velocity of movement but respond to acceleration or deceleration, especially when the head is rotated.",

These maculae are on one surface of each of these saclike structures (see Figure 12-1, Figure 12-2, Figure 12-3). Each macula is an oval-shaped plaque in which the membranous labyrinth has proliferated. The surface of the macula consists of columnar epithelial cells. This neuroepithelium is composed of hair cells and supporting cells. Covering the neuroepithelium is a gelatinous material, the statoconiorum (otolithic) membrane. On the surface of this membrane are calcareous crystalline bodies known as statoconia (otoliths). Similar to the hair cells of the cristae, the macular hair cells have projections of their luminal cell membranes\u2014stereocilia and kinocilia\u2014into the overlying statoconiorum membrane. Movement of the statoconia away from these cells is the initiating factor in bending the stereocilia to stimulate an impulse in the dendritic zones of the vestibular neurons that are in synaptic relationship with the base of the hair cells. The macula in the saccule is oriented in a vertical direction (sagittal plane), whereas the macula of the utriculus is in a horizontal direction (dorsal plane). Thus gravitational forces continually affect the position of the statoconia relative to the hair cells. These structures are responsible for the sensation of the static position of the head and linear acceleration or deceleration. They function in static equilibrium. The macula of the utriculus may be more important as a receptor for sensing changes in head posture, whereas the macula of the saccule may be more sensitive to vibrational stimuli and loud sounds.",

The vestibular nerve axons enter the medulla between the caudal cerebellar peduncle and the spinal tract of the trigeminal nerve and terminate in telodendria at one of two sites. The majority of them terminate in the vestibular nuclei in the medulla and pons.

            "text": "Neuronal cell bodies in the vestibular nuclei have three general terminations in the brainstem.1Axons course rostrally in the medial longitudinal fasciculus (MLF) to terminate in the motor nuclei of cranial nerves VI, IV, and III. Their purpose is to provide coordinated conjugate eye movements associated with changes in the position of the head. In most normal animals, this eye movement can be readily elicited by repeatedly moving the head from one side to the other and observing the jerk nystagmus that is produced. When the brainstem is severely contused by a head injury, these pathways may be disrupted, and eyeball movements cannot be elicited by changing the position of the head. This clinical sign usually indicates a poor prognosis because of the severity of the associated lesion.2Axons project into the reticular formation. Some of these axons provide afferents to the vomiting center located there. This pathway is involved with motion sickness.3We are all readily aware of any loss of our balance. Balance requires a pathway for conscious perception that involves a relay through a thalamic nucleus. This pathway is not well defined for the vestibular system. It may be closely associated with the conscious pathway for the auditory system. Axons of neuronal cell bodies in vestibular nuclei course rostrally through the midbrain to terminate in the contralateral medial geniculate nucleus of the thalamus or some other thalamic nucleus. Synapse occurs here, and the axons of the cell bodies in that thalamic nucleus project by way of the internal capsule to the cerebral cortex, probably the cortex in the temporal lobe. Interference with this conscious pathway would explain the occasional observation of clinical signs of a vestibular system dysfunction after an acute prosencephalic lesion.\n",

            "text": "Loss of coordination between the head and the neck, trunk, and limbs is reflected in a head tilt, with the more ventral ear directed toward the side of the vestibular system disorder. The degree of head tilt can vary from just a few degrees that may be difficult to recognize to nearly 45 degrees with the patient having difficulty standing up. To recognize the mild head tilt, you need to observe the patient's head from in front of the patient and with your head at the level of the head of the patient. The neck and trunk will lean, fall, or even roll toward the side of the lesion. The neck and trunk may be flexed laterally with the concavity directed toward the side of the lesion. The patient may tend to circle toward the affected side. These circles are usually small, which will appear as though the patient is falling in that direction. Animals that propulsively circle from prosencephalic lesions have no ataxia or other signs of vestibular system dysfunction and usually walk in wider circles. Occasionally, it may be possible to elicit mild hypertonia in the limbs on the side of the body opposite to the side of the vestibular system lesion. The asymmetry of the ataxia may be explained by the loss of tonic activity in the vestibulospinal tract on the side of the lesion, which removes facilitation of ipsilateral extensor muscles and a source of inhibition of contralateral extensor muscles. The unopposed activity of the contralateral vestibulospinal tract causes the neck and trunk to be forced toward the side of the lesion by excessive unopposed extensor muscle tonus. The entire body will lean, fall, or roll toward the side of the lesion. With peripheral vestibular system disorders, rolling is usually limited to the first 24 to 48 hours after a peracute onset of clinical signs. If the rolling persists longer than that, the lesion more likely involves the central components of the vestibular system. Frequently, the patient falls when it shakes its head. With only the vestibular system affected, these patients will make very rapid and short limb movements in their attempt to maintain their balance. As you evaluate a patient such as this one, you should ask yourself if this patient knows where its limbs are in space. The answer will be definitely yes if only the peripheral vestibular system is affected. Patients with vestibular ataxia use their eyes to help maintain their balance. Therefore blindfolding these patients usually makes their vestibular ataxia worse. This tactic is most helpful when you are not sure if the vestibular system is involved in the patient's clinical signs. Be cautious when you perform this test with large animals so that they do not fall and injure themselves or the observers. For horses and cattle, use a folded towel that is slipped under the halter so that it can be readily removed by pulling on one edge of the towel. Never tie the blindfold onto the halter. Cats often carry their tails elevated straight dorsally when they have a significant balance loss.",

            "text": "\nNystagmus is an involuntary rhythmic oscillation of the eyes. Eye movements that are equal in each direction indicate a pendular nystagmus, which is uncommon, usually benign, and is associated with congenital visual system pathway abnormalities. Eye movements that are unequal, with a slow movement (slow phase) in one direction and a fast return (quick phase) of the eye to its starting position, indicate a jerk nystagmus, which can be normal or abnormal and reflect a dysfunction in the vestibular system. The direction of the nystagmus, by convention, is ascribed to the direction of the quick or fast phase of the jerk nystagmus. Both eyes are usually affected and usually in the same direction. This jerk nystagmus is a normal response to any rapid movement of the head. Stand over any normal dog and watch its eyes as you move the head in a horizontal-dorsal plane form side to side. You will observe a horizontal jerk nystagmus. As you move the head to the right, both eyes will repeatedly jerk quickly to the right with a slow return to the left. As you move the head to the left, the opposite will happen; both eyes will repeatedly jerk quickly to the left and slowly return to the right. This procedure is termed normal vestibular or physiologic nystagmus. Some textbooks refer to this response as vestibular-ocular nystagmus, or a doll's eye response. It evaluates not only the vestibular system, which is the sensory arm of this response, but also the medial longitudinal fasciculus in the brainstem and the abducent nerve innervation of the lateral rectus muscle that abducts the eye and the oculomotor nerve innervation of the medial rectus muscle that adducts the eye. If you flex and extend the neck so that the head moves up and down, the same eye movements will occur in a vertical direction. This event is a vertical jerk nystagmus. The quick phase of the nystagmus is always in the direction of the head movement. This response is a normal reflex in which the slow component is initiated by way of the vestibular receptors in the membranous labyrinth and the quick component involves a brainstem center related to the vestibular system. This reflex is important in maintaining visual fixation on stationary points as the body rotates.",

It normally occurs only when you move the head. With dysfunction of the vestibular system, a jerk nystagmus may be observed. If it is observed when the head is held in its normal extended (neutral) position, it is called a resting or spontaneous nystagmus. If it is induced only by holding the head fixed in lateral flexion or full extension, it is called a positional nystagmus. These events are both forms of abnormal nystagmus. If you are suspicious of the possibility of a vestibular system disorder, looking for positional nystagmus when you place the patient on its back with its neck extended may be useful. Remember that it is normal for nystagmus to occur when you move the head! How do you explain this abnormal nystagmus? If you consider the existence of a continual bilateral stimulation of vestibular neurons that constantly reflects the position or movement of the head and that this provides a balanced tonic stimulation of the vestibular nuclei on each side and from there to the nuclei that innervate the extraocular muscles, then any interruption of this balanced tonic stimulation might result in an alteration at the nuclei of the neurons that innervate extraocular muscles that results in nystagmus. With peripheral vestibular diseases, the imbalance represents a loss of tonic stimulation of the vestibular nuclei from the affected side.",

            "text": "In disorders of the peripheral vestibular system, the abnormal resting or positional nystagmus is directed in a horizontal-dorsal plane or is rotatory but is always directed (quick phase) away from the side of the lesion or head tilt. To determine the direction of a rotatory nystagmus, observe the direction that the 12-o'clock position of the pupil moves during the quick phase. This direction does not change when the position of the head is changed. Occasionally, an abnormal positional nystagmus may appear vertical, especially when the patient is in dorsal recumbency. Previous theories suggested that vertical nystagmus only occurred with disorders of the central vestibular system, but we now believe this idea may be incorrect and oversimplified. Some patients with disorders of the peripheral vestibular system have almost a vertical nystagmus, but careful examination will usually reveal a slight rotatory component. We no longer use vertical nystagmus alone to distinguish peripheral from central vestibular system disease. With disorders of the central components of the vestibular system, the nystagmus may be horizontal, rotatory, or vertical. It may be directed toward or away from the side of the lesion, and it may change in direction with the head held in different positions. Thus the presence of a nystagmus that is directed toward the side of the lesion or head tilt or changes direction with changes in the position of the head are the only reliable features of the abnormal nystagmus that indicate a central involvement of the vestibular system. Many patients with central vestibular system disease will have abnormal nystagmus that is horizontal or rotatory and is directed to the side opposite to the side of the lesion and does not change its direction with changes in head position. Therefore, to determine a disorder of the central vestibular system, you must identify clinical signs of the central lesion that involve other neurologic systems, especially the UMN and general proprioception (GP) systems. Resting nystagmus is more common in acute disorders of the peripheral components of the vestibular system, and the rate of either resting or positional nystagmus tends to be more rapid than when the disorder is in the central components of the vestibular system. Some patients with severe resting nystagmus exhibit a slight head rotation that occurs simultaneously with the nystagmus corresponding to its rate and direction. In addition, a simultaneous eyelid blink may be seen concomitant with the nystagmus, which presumably is a reflex action. These latter two findings are very common in rabbits.",

The quick phase is in the direction of the rotation, but this aspect cannot be seen as the animal is moving. In time, the rotation of the endolymph reaches the same speed of rotation of the labyrinth. At this constant velocity, the cupulae are not deflected. Thus no rotatory stimulus reaches the vestibular nerve, and nystagmus does not occur. When the rotation is suddenly stopped, once again, a disparity occurs in the rotation of the labyrinth and the endolymph. The labyrinth is stationary, and the endolymph continues to flow for a short interval during which it deflects the cupulae. Vestibular neurons are stimulated, and nystagmus occurs. However, the direction of flow is opposite to that which occurred during acceleration, and the quick phase of the nystagmus is directed opposite to the direction of the rotation. The speed and duration of this postrotatory nystagmus are variable but should be approximately equal when the response to rotation is compared for both directions.",

In the normal small animal, when the head and neck are extended in the tonic neck reaction, the eyes should elevate and remain in the center of the palpebral fissures. With disorders of any component of the vestibular system, this effect may not occur on the side of the lesion, resulting in a dropped or ventrally deviated eye that exposes the sclera dorsally. Occasionally, a slight ventral or ventrolateral strabismus is observed without head and neck extension but disappears when the head position is changed. This action will mimic an oculomotor nerve strabismus. However, when you move the head side to side to test for normal physiologic nystagmus, the affected eye will adduct and abduct well, indicating that cranial nerves III and VI are not impaired. This inconstant abnormal eye position is known as vestibular strabismus. You should look for this impairment when you hold the head and neck in extension because it may be the only clinical sign observed in mild disorders of the vestibular system.

In the worst situation, the patient may continually roll in that direction. The ability to perform these postural reactions (except for righting) is critical to determining whether the vestibular system disorder involves the peripheral or central components of the vestibular system. You need to repeat the hopping responses many times to be comfortable that they are normal in your patient with peripheral vestibular disease. In patients with severe loss of their ability to balance, holding them securely to perform these postural reactions may be difficult. With an acute onset of severe loss of balance, delaying or repeating this part of the neurologic examination after 24 hours may be necessary to allow time for the most severe clinical signs to abate enough so that you can handle the patient for this examination. The ground surface must not be slippery and should provide good traction for the patient.

            "text": "Paradoxical vestibular system disease is a unique syndrome in which the head tilt and loss of balance are directed toward the side opposite to the central lesion, which usually involves the caudal cerebellar peduncle. An explanation for this paradox in the direction of the clinical signs of vestibular system dysfunction is based on the rule that the direction of the head tilt and balance loss will be toward the side of the least vestibular system activity. When we describe the physiologic anatomy of the cerebellum in Chapter 13, you will learn that the Purkinje neurons that form a single layer of cells in the cerebellar cortex are the only neurons that project their axons from the cerebellar cortex. These neurons are all inhibitory neurons that release gamma-amino butyric acid at their telodendria. Most of these neurons terminate via their telodendria on neuronal cell bodies in the cerebellar nuclei, which are located in the central portion of the cerebellum known as the cerebellar medulla. The neurons in these cerebellar nuclei comprise the majority of the efferent axons that leave the cerebellum to terminate in various brainstem nuclei. An exception to this rule is a small population of Purkinje neurons, most of which are located in the cortex of the folia of the flocculus in the hemisphere and the nodulus in the vermis. The Purkinje neurons of these cortical areas have axons that leave the cerebellum directly as a component of the caudal cerebellar peduncle. They terminate in the vestibular nuclei, where they are inhibitory to the activation of these neuronal cell bodies. A lesion in the caudal cerebellar peduncle interferes with this inhibition, resulting in excessive discharge of vestibular system neurons on that side. The imbalance in vestibular system activation between the two sides is recognized as a head tilt and loss of balance to the side opposite to this lesion because, as a rule, the direction of the head tilt and balance loss will be towards the side with the least activity of the vestibular system. This paradoxical syndrome is in contrast to lesions that cause a loss of activation of the neuronal cell bodies in the vestibular nuclei as seen in disorders of the peripheral components of the vestibular system or within the vestibular nuclei themselves.",

The lesions that affect the caudal cerebellar peduncle and cause the paradoxical vestibular system signs are variable and most commonly include infarcts, neoplasms, and inflammations, in our experience.

Because this disorder is most prevalent in aged dogs, it is often termed geriatric canine peripheral vestibular disease. The cause of the disorder is unknown. Microscopic study of euthanized patients are uncommon because most dogs will spontaneously recover, the procedure is not routine in most necropsy laboratories, and the process of decalcification that is required makes recognition of subtle abnormalities difficult. The rapid recovery suggests that this disease may be a functional disorder, possibly an alteration in the production and absorption of endolymph that causes increased pressure within the membranous labyrinth. This theory has been proposed for the pathogenesis of Meniere disease in humans, which is an episodic disorder of the inner-ear components. Vestibular neuronitis is described in humans with an acute onset of clinical signs of a peripheral vestibular system dysfunction. Spontaneous recovery occurs. A herpesvirus-induced vestibular ganglionitis and an autoimmune inner-ear inflammation have also been proposed in humans. Paroxysmal positional vertigo (dizziness) in humans has been related to one or more statoconia that detach from the statoconiorum membrane and lodge in one of the semicircular ducts. Recovery is associated with specific head position adjustments to dislodge the statoconia. Many of the acute peripheral vestibular diseases of humans are not well understood.11,\n17\n",

In small animals, the postganglionic sympathetic axons that innervate smooth muscle in the orbit course through or adjacent to the tympanic cavity, where they can be affected by the inflammation in middle-ear infections. Unknown is whether the dysfunction of the peripheral vestibular system requires inflammation within the inner ear or whether the alteration in pressure and temperature caused by the inflammation within the tympanic cavity is sufficient to cause these clinical signs. Otitis media is very common in small animals especially cats and young farm animals, which includes calves, lambs, kids, crias, and pigs (Figure 12-5, Figure 12-6, Figure 12-7, Figure 12-8, Figure 12-9\n). Extension of this infection into the cranial cavity is common when this ear infection is not treated vigorously, and the results of the extension can be lethal. Three anatomic routes for infection can be used to obtain access to the tympanic cavity: (1) from otitis externa, (2) from nasopharyngeal infections extending through the auditory tube, and (3) hematogenous from a bacteremia. Clinical signs can be acute or chronic in onset and progressive. The clinical signs of peripheral vestibular dysfunction are usually less severe than in dogs with the benign idiopathic disorder. The otitis can be bilateral but the neurologic signs unilateral. Otoscopic examination may show changes in the middle-ear cavity with the tympanic membrane ruptured or still intact. However, the otitis media is often undetected with this procedure, and imaging is required for the diagnosis. For years, we have relied on radiographs, but both computed tomographic (CT) and MR imaging are more reliable. CT images are better than MR images to show the degree of bone involvement (see Fig. 12-6). Ideally, treatment should be based on isolation of the infectious agent and the use of specific antibacterial or antifungal drugs to which the agent is most susceptible. Remember to avoid the aminoglycoside antibiotics that are ototoxic. Surgery may be required for chronic cases.",

The slow hopping and hemiwalking with the right limbs supports a central nervous system (CNS) lesion involving the right UMN or GP systems (or both) in the caudal brainstem or the right side of the cerebellum. The head tilt and loss of balance are directed to the left, which suggests clinical signs of a paradoxical vestibular system disorder, unless multifocal lesions are present, such as right cerebellum and left vestibular nuclei. The clinical signs of a vestibular system disorder are profound. The quality of the gait abnormality, the deficit in postural reactions, and the abnormal nystagmus that changed direction with different head positions all support that the vestibular system involvement is in its central components.

An autoimmune disease has also been proposed. GME tends to be more common in young adult small- to medium-sized breeds, but any breed at any age can be affected. The angiocentric lesions predominate in the white matter and can be diffusely distributed through the brain and spinal cord, occur in multifocal sites, or be primarily located at one site where the perivascular and parenchymal proliferation of lymphoplasmacytic cells and macrophages (histiocytes) can be so extensive as to cause a mass lesion. Lesions in the cerebellum, pons, and medulla are common. A localized form is thought to occur in the optic nerves causing an optic neuritis. Optic neuritis is described in Chapter 14 on the visual system. CSF usually reflects the lesion with marked elevation of protein and nonsuppurative inflammatory cells. MR imaging is the preferred procedure to show these lesions, especially when they are focal. These lesions are hyperintense on T2-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion-recovery (FLAIR) images. Contrast enhancement is variable. Immunosuppressive drugs such as prednisone or oral cyclosporine and lomustine may be effective at slowing or stopping the progression of the disease and alleviating some of the clinical signs. Focal lesions can be irradiated. Responses to these treatments vary.",

See examples in Chapter 13 on the cerebellum. However, the clinical signs should be acute in onset and not progress over more than 24 hours as a rule. Malformation was included in the differential diagnosis because the caudal cranial fossa is a common site for epidermoid or dermoid cysts to occur.28 These cysts are thought to be developmental in origin and result from an abnormality when the neural tube folds and closes in this area and separates from the overlying ectoderm. The epithelial lining of these cysts proliferates and secretes, causing the cyst to enlarge and, in time, produce clinical signs from its mass effect. Severe clinical signs of dysfunction in the components of the caudal cranial fossa occur with metronidazole toxicity, but these are usually symmetric and require a history of exposure to this drug.14 Hypothyroidism has been associated in adult dogs with an acute onset of persistent or progressive clinical signs of a caudal cranial fossa lesion that included involvement of the central components of the vestibular system.23 In this study, thyroid function evaluations were abnormal and all responded to treatment with levothyroxine.

Remember in cases such as this one to look at the breed and ask yourself if any recognized inherited degenerative disorder is described for this breed that causes similar clinical signs. When you search for this data in your textbooks or on the Internet, your answer will be yes. In 1975, Dr. Jack McGrath at the University of Pennsylvania described a fibrinoid encephalomyelopathy (Alexander disease) in two 8-month-old littermate Labrador retrievers with clinical signs of a diffuse CNS disorder.33 This degeneration is a disorder of astrocytes. It is associated with a loss of myelin, especially in the cerebral white matter. Thus this disease is also known as leukodystrophy. The abnormal astrocytes are widely distributed in the CNS, but their perivascular density and the myelin loss in the cerebral white matter will appear as a diffuse bilaterally symmetric hyperintensity in T2-weighted and proton-density MR images. In 1985, Dr. Dennis O'Brien described a spongy degeneration of CNS white matter, a leukodystrophy, in Labrador retrievers.37,\n52 The onset of clinical signs for the dogs in this report was 4 to 6 months of age. The lesion consists of a separation of the myelin lamellae, causing a dilation of the myelin sheath caused by the accumulation of fluid between lamellae, known as myelin edema. It is found throughout the CNS and is especially prominent where large bundles of white matter are found, such as the spinal cord, cerebellar medullary and folial white matter, internal capsule, centrum semiovale, and corona radiata. These lesions are hypointense on T1-weighted MR images and hyperintense on the T2-weighted images. An autosomal-recessive gene inheritance is presumed but is not yet proven. Roxy had a littermate that was euthanized at 4 months of age for generalized seizures, but no necropsy was performed. Roxy was euthanized, and a necropsy confirmed the diagnosis of a leukodystrophy similar to that described by O'Brien.",

(See the discussion of the similar benign idiopathic canine disorder.) Because this disease in cats occurs at the same time of year as the acute-onset brain disease caused by the myiasis of the larva of a Cuterebra sp., some neurologists have hypothesized that this peripheral vestibular syndrome is caused by the migration of this larva in the middle and inner ear. No definitive proof has been found of this occurrence whatsoever. No Cuterebra sp. larva have been found in any part of the ear of a cat with or without these clinical signs, and the few necropsies that included study of the inner-ear structures have not found a recognizable lesion. Investigators have reported that this disease can occur in cats that have no access to the outdoors, but these reports are rare. The high incidence of this disorder from late July through September in outdoor cats implies some environmental factor (e.g., insect toxin, toxic spray, plant pollen) that may cause ototoxicity. This factor is unknown. The clinical signs are peracute in onset and typical for a severe dysfunction of the peripheral vestibular system. Although the clinical signs predominate to one side, a bilateral disturbance is suggested by the occasional wide head excursions to either side and the tendency of the cat to stagger in both directions. Fortunately, most of these cats will recover spontaneously. Their vestibular ataxia will be greatly improved by 7 to 10 days, and the head tilt usually resolves by 2 to 4 weeks. Occasionally, a residual head tilt persists. Even recovered cats may exhibit a slight head tilt and balance loss if they are significantly stressed. Without more knowledge of the cause of the pathogenesis of this disorder and the spontaneous recovery, treatment of these cats is unnecessary. However, the use of antibiotics is rational as a treatment for a possible otitis, which is the other most common cause of these clinical signs. Keep these cats in a protected environment while they recover. Rarely does this disorder recur in cats, which is unlike the canine disorder. Experimental surgical ablation of the inner ear of a cat will cause similar clinical signs, including recovery by cerebellomedullary compensation.9 This disease represents just another of many reasons to keep cats indoors.",

Three days before this video was made, she rapidly lost the ability to stand and began to roll to the right side. These signs, as well as the right hemiplegia, can be seen on the video. She had a resting right or vertical nystagmus. Remember that persistent rolling is a clinical sign usually related to dysfunction of the central vestibular system components. The anatomic diagnosis is cerebellum, pons, and medulla. The most likely differential diagnosis for this 1-year-old cat would include three disorders: (1) Inflammation caused by the feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) virus or the protozoal agent Toxoplasma gondii. FIP encephalitis is the most common infection at this site. (2) Myiasis of a larva of the Cuterebra sp. of fly. (3) Abscess or suppurative meningoencephalitis secondary to otitis media-interna. CSF contained 89 mg/dl of protein (normal <20) and 289 white blood cells (WBCs)/mm3 that were predominantly neutrophils. This finding supports an inflammation that might relate to any one of these three disorders. This cat was euthanized, and a necropsy diagnosed an extensive larval migration with the dead larva found in the vermis of the cerebellum. The larva was presumed to belong to a species of Cuterebra (Figs. 12-19\n, 12-20\n). Cuterebra sp. myiasis is described in Chapter 14.",

Infection with the corona virus that causes an exudative peritonitis in cats is termed feline infectious peritonitis. Many of these cats that have an exudative peritonitis also have a mild subclinical meningitis. A few cats develop an extensive chronic FIP viral meningoencephalomyelitis with profound neurologic signs and minimal peritonitis.26,\n34,\n43 FIP viral meningoencephalomyelitis is by far the most common infectious disease of the CNS in cats, especially young cats. This abnormality is primarily a surface-oriented disease, which means that the leptomeninges on the external surface of the brain and spinal cord are affected, and the internal ependymal-lined ventricular system is also affected. The latter area includes the choroid plexuses and the central canal of the spinal cord. This disease is an immunopathologic disorder that involves an immune complex\u2013induced vasculitis. The virus can be found in macrophages in the lesion. The degree of accumulation of inflammatory cells can be extensive enough to be seen on gross examination of the CNS, as well as on MR images. Although clinical signs can reflect involvement by this lesion at any level of the CNS, they often relate to the lesions in the area of the cerebellum, pons, and medulla, known as the caudal cranial fossa. One study reported pelvic limb paresis, abnormal nystagmus, and seizures as the most common clinical signs observed with this disease. Uveitis may also accompany the neurologic disorder. Clinical signs are slowly progressive and often include partial anorexia and a fever that are unresponsive to antibiotic therapy. The globulin fraction of serum protein is often elevated, and the CSF often is very abnormal, with protein levels even as high as 0.5 to 1.0 g/dl (normal <20 mg/dl) and hundreds of WBCs/mm3 that vary from all mononuclear cells to a high percentage of neutrophils. Serum antibodies against this virus are usually, but not always, present in these cats. However, the antibodies are not specific for this virus but rather for the group of corona viruses.",

As a rule, serum antibodies will be present in cats with toxoplasmosis, and an antigen test will detect cryptococcal organisms in the serum or CSF. These fungal organisms are usually evident in the cytologic examination of the CSF. Cats with an extension of infection from the middle and inner ear may produce evidence of this ear infection on your physical examination and should have recognizable temporal bone lesions on imaging studies. Cuterebra myiasis is less likely to cause such a slow progression of neurologic signs or the persistent fever. In addition, Cuterebra myiasis is seasonal. Lymphosarcoma most commonly causes an extradural focal compression of the spinal cord but is occasionally within the parenchyma and diffusely distributed through the CNS, primarily in the meninges and the perivascular spaces within the CNS. CSF changes would be expected to be mild and may include lymphocytes, lymphoblasts, or both. Many forms of neuronal storage diseases have been recognized in cats that cause slowly progressive diffuse neurologic signs of CNS dysfunction. Diffuse whole-body action\u2013related repetitive myoclonus (tremor) is often present with storage diseases along with primarily prosencephalic signs of loss of vision, change in behavior, and seizures.

            "text": "A unique bone disorder often accompanies this otitis in horses. This abnormality is a temporohyoid osteopathy, which involves an ankylosis of this joint associated with a proliferation of the long stylohyoid bone and probably the very small tympanohyoid by which it articulates with the petrous portion of the temporal bone. This circumstance results in a fusion of these bones at the level of the tympanic portion of the temporal bone.5,\n16,\n47 This bony proliferation envelops the tympanic portion of the temporal bone but does not invade the tympanic cavity (see Fig. 6-41.) With this loss of mobility of the hyoid apparatus, a risk of fracture of the petrous portion of the temporal bone exists. The assumption is that the otitis precedes and induces the osteopathy, but no proof has been found. The few microscopic studies on the osteopathy have never shown any indication of an osteomyelitis. The cause of this bone lesion remains unknown and has not been observed in other species. The lesion is unrelated to any disease within the guttural pouch. The assumption is that the ankylosis is secondary to the infection, and the extensive enlargement of the stylohyoid bone is secondary to the immobility of this joint, which prevents normal remodeling of the bone. In some horses, the onset of clinical signs of vestibular nerve dysfunction and the facial paralysis are sudden and thought to be caused by the temporal bone fracture, especially in the few horses that exhibit a brief period of partial dysphagia from presumed involvement of cranial nerves IX and X at the jugular foramen. The latter development cannot be caused by the otitis. Whether otitis was present in these horses before the fracture is unknown. Occasionally, the bone lesion is bilateral, but the neurologic signs have always been unilateral. Radiographs will reveal the enlarged stylohyoid bone with fusion to the temporal bone, but this circumstance prevents evaluation of the middle-ear cavity. The ventrodorsal view is the most reliable view to observe this bone lesion but requires general anesthesia. Although CT imaging is the preferred way to diagnose this disorder and may reveal the fracture when it is present, general anesthesia is required. The enlargement of the stylohyoid bone, as well as the lack of movement at the temporohyoid articulation, can be seen through the wall of the guttural pouch on endoscopic examination. See Video 12-23 of an endoscopic examination of the guttural pouch of another adult horse that has a left-side stylohyoidosteopathy. The first portion of the video shows the left guttural pouch with the enlarged caudal portion of the stylohyoid bone and the lack of any movement at its articulation with the temporal bone. The last portion of the video shows the right guttural pouch with a normal stylohyoid bone. Note the movement of this bone at its articulation. You may suspect this abnormality during your physical examination by pressing dorsally on the basihyoid bone and assessing the range of motion of the hyoid apparatus, which depends on a mobile tympanohyoid articulation. You will feel resistance in horses with this bone lesion and fusion at this articulation. To prevent fracture related to this bone fusion, a portion of the affected stylohyoid bone is removed, or, more recently, the entire ceratohyoid bone has been removed. The latter surgery is easier to perform and has fewer complications.",

He fell down and fought efforts to get him to stand for 3 days. The video was made on the third day shortly after he was helped to stand. He shows considerable limb trembling in the video, which we believe is related to his prolonged recumbency and muscle compression. Note how rapidly he moves his limbs to compensate for his balance loss. Your anatomic diagnosis should be left cranial nerve VII and the left vestibular portion of cranial nerve VIII. An enlarged stylohyoid bone was observed on endoscopic examination of the left guttural pouch.

These signs include facial paralysis, tongue paresis, dysphagia, jaw paresis, and dysfunction of the central components of the vestibular system, along with clinical signs of UMN and GP system dysfunction and loss of their normal sensorium. Some patients continually circle. This circling appears more as a propulsive circling than circling caused by a loss of balance with a vestibular system dysfunction. However, this circumstance is poorly correlated with specific lesion location. Prosencephalic lesions are uncommon with listeriosis yet are the most common cause of propulsive movements. The propulsive circling may possibly occur in these ruminants with listeriosis from involvement of the substantia nigra in the mesencephalon. The prominent caudal brainstem location of this disease reflects the likely route of entrance to the brain for this bacterium. The bacterium enters the body through abrasions and lacerations of the oral mucosa and gains access to the dendritic zones of general somatic afferent (GSA) neurons in the branches of the trigeminal nerve. The bacterium travels retrograde over these axons through the trigeminal ganglion and into the pons, where the fifth cranial nerve attaches to the brainstem. Inflammation occurs in these nerve branches and in the caudal brainstem. Small foci of necrosis filled with neutrophils are scattered primarily through the pons and medulla. Adjacent to these necrotic foci is a nonsuppurative inflammation that includes the meninges. The CSF usually reflects the nonsuppurative component of the inflammation. Rigorous treatment with penicillin will usually improve or resolve the clinical signs in cattle that are still standing. The prognosis is less favorable in small ruminants. Recumbent animals have a poor prognosis regardless of the species. Be aware that this bacterium can affect humans; thus you should, at least, wear protective gloves for this examination and administration of therapy. This organism thrives in poorly prepared silage (pH greater than 5.5), and removal of this as a feed source may prevent further affected animals on the same farm. We have never seen blindness in cattle with listeriosis or cattle with the anatomic diagnosis of a spinal cord location of listeriosis. The latter circumstance may be the result of the lack of lesions in the spinal cord or the masking of these UMN and GP system lesions by the pontomedullary lesions that affect the same systems. See Video 11-33 in Case Example 11-10. This is a lamb with profound spinal cord lesions caused by listeriosis.",

Thrombotic meningoencephalitis is caused by the bacterium Histophilus somni (Hemophilus somnus). This abnormality is a severe suppurative vasculitis and associated parenchymal necrosis that usually causes a sudden onset of profound brainstem signs or just acute death. Thrombotic meningoencephalitis is an unlikely cause of the more mild brainstem signs with cranial nerve deficits, as seen in the cow in this case example.

In the United States, these dogs are called Belgian sheepdogs. This extreme nystagmus was pendular, which varied in rate but was usually quite rapid. No obvious visual deficiency was noted, and ocular examination was normal. Occasionally, a dog briefly held its head to one side as it was about to jump down from a table level. No ataxia was evident. The head would occasionally oscillate with the nystagmus. Necropsy of the three littermates revealed a complete lack of any optic chiasm (Figure 12-27, Figure 12-28, Figure 12-29\n). The optic nerve fibers continued into the ipsilateral optic tract uninterrupted and without any indication of decussation. Two of these dogs were 4 years of age at the time of necropsy, and their nystagmus had not changed. On the presumption that this malformation was an inherited disorder, and at the request of a neuroscientist interested in what determines the crossing of axons at the optic chiasm, the owner repeated the mating that produced these three affected dogs, resulting in more achiasmatic puppies with a pendular nystagmus and numerous publications.24,\n48 These studies established that the retina is relatively normal in these dogs, and the effect of the autosomal-recessive inherited mutation is most likely exerted outside the retina.",
