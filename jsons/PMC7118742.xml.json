Although referenced, at least in passing, in most major textbooks on medical law, there has been a \u2018paucity of research and teaching in public health law\u2019.1 However, its significance as an issue of public policy has perhaps never been higher. The threat of bioterrorism and the emergence of new forms of infectious disease have prompted international organizations and governments to review the state of public health laws to facilitate a swift response to health emergencies. Relatedly, there is an emerging acknowledgement that existing legislation on public health is based upon outdated assumptions regarding both the causes and spread of disease and societal arrangements. Furthermore, so-called \u2018lifestyle\u2019 diseases such as obesity and smoking-related illnesses are increasingly regarded as proper subjects for governmental attention \u2013 not least because of the pressure which they may place upon finite resources for health care \u2013 and legal intervention of various types represents one strategy for addressing the root causes of such conditions. Finally, and perhaps least tangibly, academic work which postulates that modern governments should be centrally concerned with the management of risk has prompted re-evaluation of the potential of legal mechanisms to provide a framework for the assessment of, and responses to, new forms of risk arising in the public health context.",

There was, therefore, a detachment of the individual from the collectivity \u2013 and a prioritization of the former \u2013 within both medicine and law, with the consequence that when the two disciplines coincided, the focus lay upon the individualized physician\u2013patient relationship.

Laws can regulate the availability of information, for example by restricting the advertising of unhealthy products (such as tobacco and alcohol) or requiring provision of facts to consumers (e.g. nutritional information on food labels).f\nPersons, professionals and businesses can be regulated directly (e.g. licensing of care homes or laws requiring the wearing of motorcycle helmets) or indirectly through the tort system (e.g. actions in respect of environmental damage, exposure to toxic substances etc.). Legal measures may be implemented to bring about environmental change to reduce risks to health (e.g. improvement of sanitation or health and safety in the workplace), or to bring about broader socio-economic change (legislative measures to alleviate poverty should assist in enhancing overall population health). Also, on occasion, deregulation may be necessary to achieve public health objectives; for example (and, needless to say, controversially), declassification of certain categories of drug, or decriminalization of prostitution may be said to enhance public health, particularly when implemented in conjunction with other measures, such as provision of drug rehabilitation facilities or increased availability of information on sexual health.",

A public health practitioner, seeking to move beyond medicine's focus upon diseases caused by behaviour (emphysema, lung cancer etc.), will seek to identify external factors which may stimulate such behaviour, such as parental and peer influences or socio-economic background. However, the realization of the objective of reducing this form of risky behaviour is likely to rest, in large part, upon a legal framework. Legal measures can regulate where and to whom tobacco can be sold, where it can be consumed, how it is marketed and/or displayed, the information which is provided upon the packaging and the extent to which it is taxed. In addition, law furnishes the basis for state intervention to address causative socio-economic factors in the form of action to address deprivation; for example, through improvement of housing conditions, availability of benefit or minimum wages, enhancement of educational and employment opportunities etc.",

This part of the course thus addresses issues of priority setting in a public health context, focusing especially on allocative decision making in a public health emergency situation, such as provision of ventilators following an outbreak of pandemic influenza. More broadly, it is important to examine the ethical principles which might underpin such priority setting, one especially interesting illustration of these being the \u2018social values\u2019 which NICE uses to inform the public health guidance issued to those working in the NHS, local authorities and the public and voluntary sector in England.60\n",
