            "text": "We and others have previously investigated the role of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) on early acute and late chronic demyelinating disease induced by Theiler's Murine Encephalomyelitis Virus (TMEV). Infection of susceptible SJL mice with this virus serves as an excellent model of virusinduced demyelinating disease, such as multiple sclerosis (MS). iNOS transcripts and protein were detected in brains and spinal cords of TMEVinfected SJL mice during early acute disease, which resembles polioencephalomyelitis. Similar level of expression of iNOS has been found in resistant B6 mice, which develop only early acute disease. Weak iNOS staining was detected in reactive astrocytes and in leptomeningeal infiltrates in TMEV-infected SJL mice at 42 days post infection (p.i.), corresponding to early phase of chronic demyelinating disease, but not at 66 and 180 days p.i. corresponding to advanced and terminal stages of the disease, respectively. Results from other laboratories demonstrated that, blocking of NO by treatment of TMEV-infected SJL mice with amino guanidine (AG), a specific inhibitor of NO resulted in delay of late chronic demyelinating disease. However this protective effect of NO inhibitor depended on the temporal phase of the disease, type of cells expressing iNOS and the time of administration of AG. The results from our laboratory suggests that NO expressed during early acute disease is beneficial to the host through induction of apoptosis of infiltrating T cells and resolution of encephalitis, but its role in myelin/oligodendrocytes damage during late chronic demyelinating disease is not clear and it may depend on availability of superoxide and formation of peroxynitrite.",

Early acute disease (polioencephalomyelitis) is characterized by replication of the virus in gray matter (I-4) . This phase of disease is associated with neuronophagia and inflammatory infiltrates in the cerebral gray matter and anterior horn cells of spinal cord (4, 5) . Within two to three weeks the virus is partially cleared and approximately 35 days p.i. susceptible mice develop late chronic demyelinating disease. The virus persists at very low level in microglia/macrophages, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes (1, (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) . Heavy inflammatory infiltrates comprised of CD4 + and CD8 + T cells, macrophages, and few B cells are present, exclusively in the spinal cord (7, 9, 10) . Demyelinating lesions are associated with perivascular and parenchymal inflammatory infiltrates. TMEV-induced late chronic demyelinating disease is an excellent animal model for human MS(l, 2, 7, 9, 11) . Resistant strains of mice (such as C57BL/6) develop only early acute disease, clear the virus completely and do not develop demyelinating disease.",

Although oligodendrocytes/myelin may be damaged by a direct attack of cytotoxic T cells, other cells, including CD4 + T cells, activated macrophages, and microglia may contribute to myelin destruction by the production of cytokines, such as IL-1, IFN-7, and TNF-o\u00a2,.and reactive oxygen and reactive nitrogen species (14, 16) . Nitric Oxide (NO) is a short lived, highly reactive molecule with free radical properties. It is synthesized by nitric oxide synthase (NOS) by converting of L-arginine to L-citrulline, reviewed in (17, 18) . There are three isoforms of NOS; NOStype I and NOS-type III are calcium dependent and are constitutively expressed. This results in the production of physiological levels of NO which acts as second messenger in the NO signaling pathway in the neuronal and cardiovascular system. The NOS-type II (iNOS, inducible NOS) is calcium independent and is produced in large amounts during innate and adaptive immune responses (19) (20) (21) (22) (23) (24) . NO produced during an innate immune response clearly contributes to the killing of intracellular microorganisms and parasites (25) (26) (27) . Less is known about a role of NO in the generation and regulation of an adaptive immune response, including inflammation.",

            "text": "We have demonstrated that during early acute disease induced in TMEVinfected SJL and B6 mice iNOS is expressed in the brain and spinal cord of infected animals, predominantly in hypertrophic astrocytes, monocytes/macrophages and endothelial cells in the area of inflammation (61) . During late chronic demyelinating disease, iNOS has been detected in fibrous astrocytes and meningeal infiltrates of spinal cord but only during the early stages (39 days p.i.) of late chronic demyelinating disease (SJL mice) and not at 66days p.i. or at 180 days p.i. (terminal stage of the disease). We have also demonstrated that during early acute disease there is high level of apoptosis of T cells undergoing activation induced cell death, while there is paucity of apoptosis of T cells infiltrating the CNS of TMEV-infected SJL mice during late chronic demyelinating disease (unpublished observations). We suggest that NO produced by reactive astrocytes and macrophages/microglia during early acute disease triggers apoptosis of infiltrating T cells. Conversely, lack of expression of iNOS in the CNS during late chronic demyelinating disease (days 66 and 180 p.i.) may relate to the very low level of apoptosis of these T cells. Induction of apoptosis of MBP-specific T cells by NO producing astrocytes (functioning as antigen presenting cells) has been described (62) . Molina-Holgado(63) recently reported that in brain astrocytes infected in vitro with TMEV there is high expression of iNOS and that IL-4 and IL-10 down regulate expression of iNOS by modulation of NF-rd3 activity. We have demonstrated high level of expression of proinflammatory cytokines in the CNS of TMEV-infected mice during early acute and late chronic demyelinating disease (64) . However, IL-4 transcripts have been detected primarily during late chronic demyelinating disease. It is therefore possible to suggest that IL-4 down regulates expression of NO in astrocytes in SJL mice during late chronic demyelinating disease, which may result in inhibition of apoptosis. According to this postulate, expression of iNOS during early acute disease would be beneficial to the host, because NO could be responsible for eliminating infiltrating T cells through down regulation of Bcl-2 and induction of AICD, leading to restoration of homeostasis in the CNS. Thus, NO may function as an anti-inflammatory or immunosuppressive molecule during early acute disease. Immunosuppressive effect of macrophagederived NO on T cells has also been reported (25, 28, 29) . However, lack of iNOS expression (down regulated perhaps by IL-4/NF-v,B) during late chronic demyelinating disease in TMEV-infected mice may be detrimental to the host by blocking apoptosis of infiltrating T cells. On the other hand, down regulation of NO production in the CNS of TMEV-infected mice may represent an effort of the host to curb formation of peroxinitrite, an extremely toxic molecule, which may lead to peroxidation of membranes and formation of nitrotyrosine. Whether nitrotyrosine is present in the CNS of TMEV-infected mice is not known. NO is a weak oxidant and acts rather like an antioxidant and only in reaction with superoxide it forms peroxynitrite, very toxic molecule. We and others demonstrated the expression of iNOS and nitrotyrosine in reactive astrocytes and monocytes/macrophages in Multiple Sclerosis lesions (43, 45) . In general the expression of iNOS and nitrotyrosine seems to depend on the extent of lesion activity (acute vs. chronic).",

            "text": "The effect of specific iNOS inhibitor, amino guanidine (AG) on mice infected with DA strain of TMEV has been examined (66) . Treatment of TMEV-infected mice starting at day 28 p.i. till day 49 p.i. significantly decreased inflammation, demyelination and axonal necrosis. This treatment was associated with decreased apoptosis of CNS infiltrating cells, presumably monocytes or lymphocytes. Early treatment (starting at day 7 p.i.) was not effective (66) . When TMEV-infected mice were treated starting at day 14 p.i., only demyelination and axonal necrosis were decreased while the level of inflammation was not changed (66) . These results suggest that inflammation and demyelination and axonal damage may be differentially down regulated by treatment of TMEV-infected mice with NO inhibitors at different times of infection. The outcome of treatment may depend on the level of activation of macrophages/microglia and astrocytes, which produce NO but also on availability of superoxide. The role of iNOS in TMEV induced demyelinating disease has also been examined using BeAn strain of the virus (instead of DA strain routinely employed in our laboratory). The BeAn strain of TMEV replicates with different kinetics in the CNS of SJL mice (67) . For example, mice infected with BeAn show clinical signs of disease such as extensor spasm and hind leg of paralysis at 50 days p.i., whereas, mice infected with DA strain of TMEV do not show these signs earlier than 180 days p.i. Treatment of SJL mice infected with BeAn strain of TMEV with AG during the effector phase of the disease (initiating treatment at 15 days p.i.) resulted in significant delay of inflammatory demyelinating disease (67) . Interestingly, iNOS was detected at low levels in monocytes/macrophages (MOMA-positive) in leptomeninges and perivascular spaces, but not in astrocytes, in TMEV infected mice between 0 and 15 days p.i. (67) . The maximum expression of iNOS was observed at day 60 p.i. In contrast, iNOS expression was high in the CNS of SJL mice infected with DA strain of TMEV between 6 and 10 days p.i., but was not detectable at 66 and 180 days p.i. Treatment of TMEV (BeAn)-infected mice with AG in the induction phase (starting at day 1 p.i.) did not alter the course of the disease (67) . The authors suggested that protective effect of AG on inflammatory demyelinating disease observed in BeAn infected mice when treatment had begun 15 days p.i. was associated with suppression of activation and proliferation of inflammatory macrophages and lymphocytes (67) . The results of these experiments suggest that the effect of NO on inflammatory demyelinating disease induced by these two strains of TMEV may depend on the kinetics of disease, time of appearance of inflammatory infiltrates, type of cells which express iNOS and time of administration of the inhibitor.",

(A) Encephalitis and poliomyelitis phase: an area of intense leptomeningeal inflammation accompanied by reactive astrogliosis in the subjacent brain parenchyma, which is highlighted by GFAP staining. (B) Same field from an immediately adjacent section exhibiting iNOS-like staining in reactive subpial astrocytes (arrowheads) as well as in scattered monocytes/macrophages in the overlying leptomeningeal infiltrate (top portion of photomicrograph). (C) Encephalitis and poliomyelitis phase: iNOS-like localization in hypertrophic endothelial cells of a blood vessel amidst an area of necrotizing encephalitis. (D) Encephalitis and poliomyelitis phase, iNOS-like staining in cells of the monocyte/macrophage lineage and in vascular endothelial cells from an area of spinal grey matter inflammation. (E) Early stage of spinal cord demyelination exhibiting a number of scattered iNOS-positive astrocytes in a background of incipient vacuolar changes (arrowheads) suggestive of early demyelination involving the lateral column. (F) Spinal cord demyelination phase: Focal, weak, and ill-defined iNOS-like immunoreactivity is detected among leptomeningeal infiltrates (the three arrows) which are encroaching upon the lateral funiculus of the spinal cord. Note vacuolar change in the lateral column (arrowheads). (G) Spinal cord demyelination phase: Lack of iNOS-like staining in large foamy (myelin-laden) macrophages in full-blown demyelinating lesions in the posterior columns of the thoracic cord.
