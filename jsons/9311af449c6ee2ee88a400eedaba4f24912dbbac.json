The twentieth century started with the outbreak of the pandemic H1N1 influenza virus in 1918, infecting one-third of the world's population and accounting for 50 million lives worldwide. It is known as the most deadly pandemic in the history of mankind. The influenza virus struck again in [1957] [1958] in the form of the H2N2 influenza A virus, triggering a pandemic that claimed 1.1 million lives worldwide. Pandemic outbreaks are not new and occur from time to time. The major problem is controlling and developing effective solutions for these outbreaks as well as monitoring the viruses and other microbes closely for their mutations and cross-genetic translation. Table 2 .1 provides a summary of major pandemic outbreaks that have occurred in the history of mankind till date (as per available sources; WHO, CDC, seeker.com and mphonline.com) (Lamb 2013; Bai et al. 2020; Staff 2020) .",

The first 54 reported cases of COVID-19 were observed in December 2019 at Wuhan, China, and this has now spread across the globe affecting 440,318 people in 195 countries. The severity of the infection increases due to its human-to-human transmission ability majorly by means of contact and large droplets. Additionally, it can also be transmitted through aerosols and fomite on various surfaces and cause infection (Perlman 2020) . This chapter intends to provide an insight on the epidemiology of COVID-19 for a better understanding of disease patterns and distribution.",

Due to the insufficient information and suppress reporting on COVID19 outbreak from China many of the countries across the world were not able to understand the severity neither preprepared themselves to tackle this health emergency (Pisa 2020) . At national level, many governments developed a digital surveillance system to keep track of international travelers, isolated people, COVID-19 positive contacted people, and those with quarantine status. This close monitoring will help achieve a decline in COVID-19 cases as well as in containment of the virus. Additionally, several governments have developed online live digital tools to continuously monitor and update the current numbers of COVID-19 cases. The WHO live situation reports provide live status of emerging cases across the globe and pattern of disease spread. Besides this, some other independent agencies are also keeping close watch on COVID-19 development such as John Hopkins University, Centre for Disease Control, worldometer.info, NIH, etc. The Pandemicity project, a multilingual medical research database for nCoV-19 started by pandemicity.org, includes several tools for screening and calculating risk factors of COVID-19 online. Many scientific publication houses are providing open access to COVID-19-related research works, which enables researchers worldwide to develop effective diagnostic and therapeutic solutions. The effective surveillance from local community level to regional level to national level to world level is the key to find effective solutions for containment of the virus. Worldwide surveillance also provides on-time alerts as to potential locations where the infection may be emerging. Additionally surveillance enables enhanced cooperation among affected countries for formulation of collective measures to fight pandemic like COVID19.",

Wuhan became the epicenter of COVID-19 just after emergence of the disease. Government and local bodies worked tirelessly to control the spread of COVID-19. Initially COVID-19 was not identified as a humanto-human transmission disease, but with exponential increase in cases research on COVID-19 established the fact that disease is transmitted from human to human via aerosol. The SARS-CoV-2 virus is a novel coronavirus of the family Coronaviridae and very little is known about its characteristics (Tekes and Thiel 2016; Ashour et al. 2020) . As we gain more knowledge about CoV2, its spread is also increasing exponentially. The initial epicenter of the disease shifted from Wuhan to Europe to the USA. Italy appears worst affected having 69,176 reported cases till March 25, 2020, with the maximum number of deaths of 6820 infected people. USA with 51,914 positive cases is emerging as another epicenter. Since there is no vaccine or medication available for the novel coronavirus, social distancing and proper maintenance of self as well as surrounding sanitation is the only treatment. The long and strict lockdown in China shows excellent decline in viral infection and social distancing found very helpful in containment of the virus. The initial lighter attitude of European countries and the USA is one of the major reasons for their emergence as an epicenter of the disease. Highly populated countries like India must learn from the mistakes of these nations and implement strict measures for containment of the virus, as uncontrolled outbreak of the disease could lead to a devastating situation for developing countries like India. Another region of potential threat is Iran where the number of deaths has increased exponentially, with 2077 deaths recorded till March 25, 2020. Underdeveloped countries with lack of basic facilities, public awareness, and poverty like Pakistan and African countries may emerge as another epicenter for COVID-19. Special attention and extended help need to be given to such nations for fighting the pandemic.",
