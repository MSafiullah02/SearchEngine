The Guangdong health authority officially informed about this outbreak on 11 February 2003. The first atypical pneumonia cases outside China were reported to WHO on 3 March from Hanoi, Vietnam (Whaley & Mansoor 2006), followed by similar reports from Hong Kong on 11 March (Tomlinson & Cockram 2003) and from Canada, Singapore and Taiwan on 14 March (Merianos et al. 2005). In Beijing, the outbreak began around 5 March (2nd March according to WHO), with the importation of several cases and subsequent spread in health care facilities (Pang et al. 2003). By 11 July, 8437 cases and 813 deaths were reported from 32 countries (WHO 2003e); these figures were later corrected to ultimately 8096 SARS cases and 774 deaths in 29 countries and areas between November 2002 and July 2003 (WHO 2003b). More than 95% of cases occurred in 12 countries of the Western Pacific Region with mainland China being the worst affected (WHO 2003c). A comprehensive analysis of the Chinese SARS database led to some duplicate cases being removed and other new cases being added so that mainland China ultimately counted a total of 5327 probable SARS cases (Feng et al. 2009). Beijing had the largest outbreak, harbouring nearly 50% of China\u2019s SARS cases (Pang et al. 2003).",

In response to the hospital clusters and the realisation that SARS had spread via air travel, WHO issued global alerts on 12 and 15 March 2003, providing case definitions based on clinical signs and symptoms, recommending isolation and barrier nursing of suspect cases and reporting such cases to national authorities (Heymann 2005). For a new rapidly spreading disease that did not respond to the classic antiviral therapies and for which no vaccines were available, traditional public health interventions, such as early case detection, case isolation, tracing and quarantine of contacts, strict infection control, decreasing social interaction and keeping the public informed were the only options available (Bell and WHO Working Group on Prevention of International and Community Transmission of SARS 2004). In less than 4 months on 5 July 2003, WHO announced the interruption of human\u2010to\u2010human SARS transmission (Merianos et al. 2005).",

For this review, a comparative approach was chosen owing to China\u2019s unique situation, as it was the first and most severely affected country where SARS emerged, and it showed an initial reluctance to deal openly with the situation. This review summarises and compares the major control measures implemented in mainland China, to those in Singapore, Vietnam, Hong Kong (SAR), Taiwan (RoC) and Canada and thereby aims to highlight distinctive features of the Chinese approach. The lessons could help policy makers to modify outbreak management strategies for a better preparedness and earlier response in future.",

In Vietnam, Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Canada, SARS became a notifiable disease by the end of March and they all reported cases to the WHO as they were identified (Table 2). In China\u2019s Guangong Province, case reporting of atypical pneumonia cases using a standard case definition and reporting form was already mandatory from 3 February 2003. All hospitals had to report the cases to the local centre for disease control, which in turn reported it to the provincial centre (Xu et al. 2004). The Chinese Ministry of Health (MOH) approved the listing of SARS as an infectious disease on 8 April. This action was the legal authority for health departments to institute the rules of the \u2018Prevention and Treatment Law\u2019, for example, quarantine, isolation, etc., to control spread (Rothstein et al. 2003). Hereafter, health authorities from all provinces were required to daily collect and report all probable SARS cases and deaths using a standardised case report form (Pang et al. 2003). To ensure complete reporting, a \u2018zero reporting\u2019 system was adopted, i.e. all hospitals had to report even if they had no SARS cases (Shan 2003). Violating reporting rules or concealing information was punishable under the law (Rothstein et al. 2003). Complete reporting of cases from China to WHO on a regular basis started around 20 April (Balasegaram & Schnur 2006).",

On 15 March, WHO named the new disease SARS and formulated a case definition based on clinical signs and symptoms and a history of contact or travel to a SARS affected area. This case definition, which closely resembled the Guangdong definition, was used by most countries but often in a modified version. Singapore, for example, expanded on the WHO\u2019s case definition and adopted a \u2018wide\u2010net\u2019 surveillance policy to detect cases with atypical presentations early (Tan 2006). In China, initially having close contact with a SARS case or having infected another person was essential for the diagnosis, later a history of stay or travel to an area with SARS transmission (e.g. Beijing) or contact with a health care facility was sufficient (Wu et al. 2004). In Canada\u2019s case definition Toronto was not included in the list of affected areas, only contact to a health care setting (Health Canada 2003a).",

Singapore for example made intensive efforts to locate contacts within 24 h of case notification, set up a contact tracing centre with up to 140 employees, involved the armed forces in contact tracing and set up a contact database accessible to all hospitals (Tan 2006). In Beijing, the district CDC staff started interviewing cases from 9 April about potential close contacts during the 2 weeks prior to symptom onset.

In addition, lower\u2010level government officials feared reprimand or being bypassed for promotion, on account of inefficiency and hence also hampered or distorted the upward flow of information. An additional communication gap arose because of the large number of cases, which were received by the Beijing military hospitals and initially not reported to the state medical system (Huang 2004). This resulted in a delayed and limited flow of information to the provincial and central level health authorities giving rise to a distorted picture consequentially delaying policy decisions.",

According to the 1996 Implementing Regulations on the State Secrets Law, the decision of publicly announcing an infectious disease outbreak lies within the authority of the Chinese MOH and is not to be openly disclosed until that time. Therefore, anyone who reports about such an occurrence without prior permission is liable to persecution, which partially explains why Guangdong could not share their information with other provincial health authorities (Huang 2004). The MOH\u2019s decision to finally list SARS as an infectious disease on 8 April opened the way for implementing the provisions provided in the \u2018Law on Prevention and Treatment of Infectious Diseases\u2019 at all levels and hence marked the turnaround in China\u2019s SARS control policy. This included instituting measures such as accurate case reporting, imposing sanctions for non\u2010reporting, institution of quarantine and isolation, initiating open communication at all levels, etc. (Rothstein et al. 2003). Establishing a system where the central and local authorities are well connected and each level has its predefined responsibilities could avert such delays. The Chinese public health emergency regulations now require the immediate setting up of an emergency task force after a health crisis is identified, in addition cases can be reported directly to China CDC and MOH by the local level through internet based reporting (Huang 2004).",

The WHO\u2019s request for sending an expert team to China for investigation, after the Guangdong outbreak in February, was approved with delay on 2 April (Balasegaram & Schnur 2006). The treatment and control guidelines developed and implemented by the Guangdong authorities in January 2003 were commended by the WHO as a \u2018model for the rest of China or maybe for the rest of the world\u2019 but, on account of different legal and political constraints mentioned earlier, this information was not shared with other Chinese provinces and the rest of the world until early April 2003.

Shanghai for instance placed people from Beijing under quarantine even in the absence of symptoms (Huang 2004). Such a large scale quarantine might have been effective for China because of its unique situation as many of the initial SARS cases in Guangdong were food handlers or sold wild animals (Xu et al. 2004) along with the fact that more than 65% of cases in Beijing did not have a contact history during the later phase of the epidemic (Wu et al. 2004) but generally its effectiveness for containing SARS was questioned as only a very small percentage of quarantined individuals developed SARS (Bell and WHO working group on prevention of international and community transmission of SARS 2004; Day et al. 2006). In Hong Kong 2.7% (Tsang 2005) and in Taiwan only 0.22% (Bell and WHO working group on prevention of international and community transmission of SARS 2004) of quarantined individuals developed SARS. Monitoring contacts and placing them under isolation if symptoms develop would have been less distressing and impinging on individual freedom. Yet, SARS could be effectively controlled in the absence of quarantine only if the isolation measures in place are very effective and strict (Day et al. 2006).",

This underlines the importance of continuing active and passive surveillance specially among high\u2010risk groups including HCWs and patients and in high\u2010risk settings like hospitals, rehabilitation centres or even senior citizens homes. The example of Hong Kong where 72 elderly home residents had developed SARS reinforces the significance of these measures (Tsang 2005).",

The time between symptom onset and hospitalisation in Beijing reduced significantly from initially 5\u20136 days before the outbreak was made public to 2 days after widespread information became available (Pang et al. 2003).

In addition, it might have resulted in a publication bias with over projection of effective control measures while leaving out negative aspects. Because of language constraints articles and books published in Chinese, Malaysian, Vietnamese and French languages could not be reviewed, i.e. only literature published or translated in English language was used, which might have limited the diversity of opinion and information to some extent.

Yet, criticising retrospectively is always easy. The dilemma of trying to maintain economic and social stability while at the same time protecting public health would challenge any nation. The SARS outbreak which fortunately was only moderately transmissible, indicates how dire the consequences of a highly infectious disease outbreak could be. The significance of timely information was perhaps the main lesson that the SARS epidemic taught. The key is to be prepared for such events as far as possible by establishing sensitive surveillance systems, clear reporting pathways, open communication structures, co\u2010operation among nations and well planned and tested pandemic plans.",
