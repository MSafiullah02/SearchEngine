These viruses are divided into subtypes according to their antigenic properties and surface hemagglutinin and neuraminidase antigens (Brydak 2012). In the Northern Hemisphere, the highest incidence of infection occurs in winter, and the subtypes causing the epidemic vary each season. In the 2013/2014 and 2014/2015 seasons, both A/H3N2/ and A/H1N1/pdm09 subtypes were observed in the population (Hallmann-Szeli\u0144ska et al. 2016; Bednarska et al. 2015). The A/H3N2/ subtype was not recorded in the 2015/2016 season. The purpose of this study was to report which influenza virus exerted in controlling influence in the most recent 2016/2017 season in Poland, the epidemiological information essential for selecting the antigenic content of successive seasonal influenza vaccine by the World Health Organization agencies (WHO 2016).",

A preliminary testing, performed by the country\u2019s Voivodeship Sanitary Epidemiological Stations, diagnosed influenza infection in 228 samples. These samples were reinvestigated at the National Influenza Center, National Institute of Public Health-National Institute of Hygiene in Warsaw, Poland, and the infection was confirmed in 205 specimens. Of the influenza viruses, unsubtyped type A accounted for 66.8% of all confirmed influenza infections. Subtype A/H3N2/ constituted 31.2% of all confirmations; type B amounted to 2.0% of confirmed infections (Fig. 1). In the 2016/2017 epidemic season, the A/H3N2/ subtype was most frequently diagnosed in people aged 26\u201344 years, accounting for 19.9% of all confirmed infections with this subtype, followed by 45\u201364 years, where it constituted 19.7% and 65+ years with 17.3%. In the children age groups of up to 14 years of age, the A/H3N2/ subtype accounted for about 10\u201314% of infections; the prevalence of infection was the lowest in adolescents. This pattern of infection distribution by the age groups was grossly similar to that in the 2014/2015 season, with two major exceptions. In that past season, prevalence of subtype A/H3N2/ was about twice greater for the age 0\u20134 and twice smaller for 65+ years compared with the 2016/2017 (Fig. 2).",

We found that the A/H3N2/ subtype of influenza virus predominated in Poland during the 2016/2017 season. This finding contrasted with the preceding 2015/2016 season when, although somehow fewer samples were tested, the A/H1N1/pdm09 subtype predominated (Cie\u015blak et al. 2017; Kowalczyk et al. 2017; Szyma\u0144ski et al. 2017a). However, the A/H3N2/ also was a leading subtype in the 2014/2015 season, although it circulated together with the A/H1N1/pdm09 subtype (Bednarska et al. 2016). Vice versa, in the still earlier 2013/2014 season, the A/H3N2/ circulated together with the then predominant A/H1N1/pdm09 (Bednarska et al. 2015). These findings suggest that the two influenza virus subtypes, A/H3N2/ and A/H1N1/pdm09, assume the leading epidemiological role alternately every other year.",

            "text": "The predominant circulation of the A/H3N2/ subtype in the 2016/2017 season has also been observed in the countries neighboring Poland as well as in other parts of the world (WHO 2017a). In Europe, two-thirds of the cases diagnosed as the A/H3N2/ infection were identified as belonging to subclass 3C.2a1 that is antigenically close to the 3C.2a, a subclass from which the vaccine was derived for the subsequent 2017/2018 epidemic season (Flu News Europe 2017, WHO 2017b). Data collected in this study point to a typical pattern of seasonal influenza epidemic, with the majority of infections in the age groups of 0\u20134, 5\u20139, and 65+ years, i.e., the most vulnerable age categories. The predominant influenza virus subtype seems irregularly variable in successive seasons. In 2013/2014 and 2014/2015, co-predomination of the A/H1N1/pdm09 and A/H3N2/ subtypes was observed, whereas A/H1N1/pdm09 predominated alone in 2015/2016 and A/H3N2/ in the 2016/2017 season. Nor could any regularity be substantiated in the geographical distribution of the most affected regions across the country in successive epidemic seasons (Szyma\u0144ski et al. 2017b).",
