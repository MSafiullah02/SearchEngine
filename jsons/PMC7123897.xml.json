The surface of a NW-FET is functionalized with biomolecule receptors, such as monoclonal antibodies or single-strand DNA (ssDNA) probes, which can selectively bind to biomolecule targets in solution. The binding of charged biomolecules, (the sign and number of charges depend on the isoelectric point of the biomolecules and the solution pH), leads to a variation of charge or electric potential at the NW surface, in a way similar to applying an external potential to gate electrode in a conventional FET device. The charge carrier densities of the NW-FET is thus tuned and leads to an electrical conductivity change associated with the biomolecular binding events in real time. Since the NW diameters can be similar to biomolecules such as proteins and nucleic acids, these binding events can be sensitively detected by the NW-FETs. Furthermore, incorporation of a number of NW-FET elements in a single sensor chip where the NWs are functionalized with different surface receptors allows for multiplexed electrical detection in the same assay, enabling a unique and powerful platform for chemical/biological recognition [6].",

In a standard planar metal-oxide semiconductor FET (Fig. 10.1a), the semiconductor substrate is connected to the gate (G), the source (S) and the drain (D) electrodes. If no gate voltage is applied (the \u201cOff\u201d state), the FET is equivalent to two back-to-back p\u2013n junctions with almost no current flows. In the \u201cOn\u201d state, when the gate bias exceeds a threshold voltage, carriers (e.g., holes for p\u2013Si and electrons for n\u2013Si) are induced at the semiconductor\u2013oxide interface, the potential barrier of the channel drops, resulting in a significant current flow. Therefore, the conductance of the semiconductor channel between the source and drain regions can be switched on and off by the potential at the gate electrode.\n",

Similar to planar FET, the conductance of a NW-FETs can be controlled by variations in the charge density or electric potential in the channel region. This response makes NW-FETs ideal candidates for chemical and biological sensing, as the change in electric field due to binding of a charged molecule to the NW surface, which is analogous to applying a voltage via a gate electrode, can readily change the device conductance. For example, a p-type SiNW functionalized with surface receptors that can specifically capture chemical/biomolecule targets will exhibit an increase in conductance when negatively charged molecules bind to the receptors. This increase in conductance is similar to applying a negative gate voltage and results from accumulation of charge carriers (holes) in the p-type FET (Fig. 10.1b). Conversely, binding positively charged molecules will deplete hole carriers and reduce the conductance. Hence, NW-FETs can enable real-time label-free direct electrical readout of biological events, including binding/unbinding, enzymatic reactions and electron transfer. These detection capabilities are ideal for developing a platform system for analyzing biological samples.",

            "text": "Semiconductor NWs composed of Si or other materials (e.g., ZnO, SnO2 and In2O3) have been explored extensively as FET sensors [8\u201310]. Among these NW materials, the potential to achieve molecular-size diameters [11], high electron or hole mobility [12], and versatile surface functionalization of SiNWs [13], as well as the potential of interfacing with existing mature silicon industry processing, have made SiNWs one of the most widely studied for biomolecular sensing [3\u20135]. SiNW-FETs are transformed into nanosensors by surface functionalization with probe molecules that enable the specific recognition of chemical/biological molecule targets. Covalent binding to the native silicon oxide (SiO2) layer that naturally grows on SiNWs represents one of the most robust approaches for probe attachment and takes advantage of the wealth of knowledge available from studies focused on functionalization of glass (SiO2) slides [14]. A detailed surface functionalization process is described elsewhere [13]. The simplest and earliest established example of this approach is hydrogen\u2013ion concentration detection or pH sensing [8]. In this case, the SiO2 layer at a p-SiNW surface is modified with 3\u2013aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES), which yields amino group (\u2013NH2) termination on the NW surface (Fig. 10.2a). The amino groups and silanol groups (Si-OH) on the unreacted regions of the oxide layer undergo protonation and deprotonation as the hydrogen-ion concentration varies, thereby changing the surface charge and the NW conductance. The NW electrical conductance shows a stepwise, discrete and stable increase, in response to increasing pH from 2 to 9 (Fig. 10.2b). More recently, Noy and coworkers demonstrated SiNW-FETs modified with lipid bilayers with and without ligand-gated and voltage-gated ion channels to monitor the solution pH. For lipid bilayer containing ion channels, devices responded to changes in solution pH, and when the channels were blocked the device response was strongly diminished [15]. Sensing studies of several distinct classes of biological targets are discussed below.\n",

In 2001, pioneering work demonstrated real-time protein sensing with SiNW-FET device [8]. Specifically, SiNWs functionalized with biotin receptors were used to selectively detect streptavidin at concentrations down to 10 pM, substantially lower than other methods at the time. However, the strong binding affinity between biotin and streptavidin leads to effectively irreversible binding and precluded monitoring unbinding and sequential measurements at different streptavidin concentrations. To overcome this limitation, several reversible surface modifications have been explored, including biotin\u2013monoclonal antibiotin binding and calmodulin (CaM)-Ca2+ interaction, to investigate quantitative concentration-dependent analyses [8]. In a more recent study [16], CaM\u2013modified SiNWs are used to detect Ca2+ and CaM\u2013binding proteins through the association/ dissociation interaction between glutathione and glutathione S\u2013transferase. In addition, this basic approach has been used to demonstrate successful concentration-dependent detection of cardiac troponin T [17] (a biomarker for myocardial infarction), SARS virus nucleocapsid proteins [18], and bovine serum albumin [19] in recent literature and thus further validate the efficacy of NW-FETs as protein sensors.",

            "text": "In genomics and proteomics research, simultaneous detection of multiple proteins is believed to be especially important for diagnosing complex diseases such as cancers [20, 21]. Moreover, the availability of different biomarkers matched with different stages of diseases could allow for early detection and robust diagnosis. Early work on SiNW-FET devices [8], although powerful in detecting binding/unbinding of proteins, lacked the capability of selective multiplexed sensing. To address this issue, Zheng et al. [22] developed integrated NW sensor arrays, in which ~100 individually addressable NW-FETs were functionalized with several different receptors (Fig. 10.3a), and demonstrated several new sensing capabilities. Specifically, monoclonal antibodies for the cancer marker proteins prostate specific antigen (PSA) carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and mucin-1 were used to functionalize SiNW-FETs in the same device array (Fig. 10.3b). Upon addition of buffer solutions containing different concentrations of these cancer biomarkers, changes in electrical conductance of the corresponding NW-FETs were recorded with femtomolar sensitivity, which is several orders of magnitude better than possible with the standard enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) [22]. This work also introduced the new concept of incorporating both p-type and n-type NWs into the same device array (Fig. 10.3c). In so doing, the binding of a negatively charged biomarker such as PSA on the NW sensor surfaces led to an increase in conductance for p-SiNWs and a decrease for the n-SiNWs in the same sensor chip. These complementary, opposite electric signals can be used to distinguish false positive signals and enable real-time, highly sensitive and selective detection of multiplexed biomolecule targets. Similarly, Li et al. [9] reported the complementary sensing of PSA using n-type In2O3 NWs and p-type carbon nanotubes. The enhanced electrical conductance for the NW sensors and the suppressed electrical signal for the carbon nanotube sensors upon the PSA addition are demonstrated with concentrations down to 5 ng/mL sensitivity at physiological buffer concentrations.\n",

The surface functionalization methods and detection schemes used in these studies were similar to those described above for protein sensing, where nucleic acid concentration is transduced following binding to a probe by changes in device conductance. A major difference between nucleic acid and protein detections exists in the fact that the high density of negative charges on the nucleic acid phosphate backbones requires high ionic strength buffers to screen the repulsion and allow for binding when DNA or RNA is used as the probe molecule. However, high ionic strength solutions have short Debye screening lengths (see Sect. 10.4.3), which can make difficult or preclude detection. A solution that overcomes this high ionic strength binding/screening issue involves using neutral charge peptide nucleic acids (PNAs) [28, 29], which exhibit excellent binding affinity with DNA at lower ionic strengths. Indeed, modification of SiNWs with PNA probe molecules was shown to exhibit time-dependent conductance changes associated with selective binding of complimentary target DNA at concentrations as low as 10 fM. Moreover, this work showed that a DNA SiNW-FET biosensor could be used to distinguish fully complementary (wild type) versus single-base mismatched (mutant) DNA targets associated with Cystic fibrosis [25]. Additional studies using SiNWs functionalized with PNA probes in which the DNA target binding domain distance was changed exhibited a reduction in sensitivity with increasing distance between the hybridization site and the NW surface [30]. This observation is consistent with basic sensing mechanism since the \u2018field effect\u2019 is reduced for fixed charge as the separation from the SiNW surface increases.",

PNA-functionalized SiNW devices have shown the capability to detect miRNAs down to a remarkable sensitivity of 1 fM [33], ca. one order of magnitude better than reported earlier for DNA detection [30]. This phenomenon can be attributed to the higher thermal stability and melting temperature of PNA\u2013RNA complex than that of PNA\u2013DNA complex.

By recording the electrical conductance changes upon binding/unbinding of virus particles to monoclonal antibody-modified SiNWs, the selective detection of influenza A at the single particle level was demonstrated [35]. The binding kinetics between different virus\u2013receptor interactions were also electrically differentiated by SiNW-FETs (Fig. 10.4). In addition, simultaneous detection of influenza A and adenovirus using independent SiNW biosensors functionalized with distinct antibodies for these two types of viruses was demonstrated [35], and more recently, SiNW-FET based selective detection of influenza A viruses down to 29 viral particles per micro-liter was achieved for breath condensate samples [36].

Focusing on sensing, Jiang et al. [47] developed the general synthesis of branched, single-crystalline semiconductor NW heterostructures, including Si backbones with Au branches.

            "text": "The fundamental characteristics of NW-FET devices, such as the transconductance and noise, can have substantial effect on the ultimate detection sensitivity. Conventionally, nanoFET-based sensors are operated in the \u2018ON\u2019 state (above the threshold voltage), where the transconductance depends linearly on gate-voltage or surface potential. However, in the subthreshold regime it is well-known that the device conductance depends exponentially on gate-voltage [50], which could in principle lead to much higher analyte binding sensitivity. Indeed, Gao et al. [51] studied and compared the detection sensitivity of SiNW-FET sensors in the linear and subthreshold regimes (Fig. 10.6). In previous literature using SiNW-FET sensors [8], the conductance change (\u0394G) or the resistance change (\u0394R) of the sensor devices was used to quantify the concentration of the target molecules. However, an absolute signal change, such as \u0394G, does not reflect the intrinsic device sensitivity, especially when working in the subthreshold regime where device conductance is very small. To better compare sensing in different device regimes Gao et al. used a dimensionless parameter, \u0394G/G, to characterize and compare device sensitivities. This principle is exemplified in both pH and protein sensing experiments, where the electrolyte gating is used to tune the operational mode of NW-FETs (Fig. 10.6b). These results showed that significant sensitivity enhancement could be achieved by optimization of the FET operating conditions and understanding the fundamental electrical gating property of NW-FETs. One caveat to the success of this work is that the device noise should be dominated by carrier-carrier scattering, such that the noise is also exponentially reduced in the subthreshold regime. If the noise is dominated by other scattering mechanisms, such as contact current injection and/or interface trapping/detrapping, then it may not be possible to exploit the exponential dependence of conductance on gate-voltage/surface potential in the subthreshold regime.\n",

The charges of solution-based molecules, however, can be screened by dissolved counter ions in the solution. The Debye length, which is inversely proportional to the square root of the ionic strength of an electrolyte, represents the net or screened electrostatic effect of a charged species in ionic solution. A high ionic strength electrolyte solution leads to a short Debye length, and charges outside of the Debye length are electrically screened. For instance, the Debye length of 1 \u00d7 PBS, ~0.7 nm, can screen most protein antigen charges when they bind to an antibody modified FET surface. In order to reduce the charge screening effect of electrolyte solutions, the Debye length is typically increased by using dilute buffer solutions with low ion concentrations [18, 52].",

These studies are promising, although further studies are needed to determine how general detection is under the limit of physiological conditions (Debye length <1 nm) as the sizes of the aptamer and antibody fragment receptors are similar to or greater than this critical length scale.

Using PSA as a model system, they showed that PEG-coated SiNW-FETs can detect PSA in phosphate buffer concentrations up to 150 mM, with a detection sensitivity of ~10 nM and linear response range up to 1000 nM. In contrast, similar FETs without PEG functionalization can only detect PSA in buffer salt concentrations lower than 10 mM (Fig. 10.8b). This work suggests a new and general device design strategy for the FET sensor applications in physiological environments, important for in vitro and in vivo biological sensing.\n",

Compared to the detection limit without AC excitation, NW sensors modified with monoclonal antibodies for PSA in an appropriate AC field exhibit close to a ~104 fold increase in sensitivity; that is, the protein concentration at the sensor surface is increased by DEP. In addition, NW devices functionalized with other receptors for capturing cholera toxin subunit B were also demonstrated, suggesting the general applicability of this method for enhanced sensitivity detection [22, 57, 58].

For example, binding and unbinding can affect the intrinsic device noise, and thus can be characterized through measurements of the frequency-dependent noise spectra (Fig. 10.9a) [60]. In a recent study, the noise spectra was used to analyze contributions from different noise sources [60]. The frequency domain spectrum of a fluctuating two-level system has the form of a Lorentzian function similar to that of a RC circuit (Fig. 10.9b and c). The 1/ noise is well-known in conventional metal\u2013oxide semiconductor FETs (MOSFETs), and arises from electron capture/emission from trap states [61, 62]. If biomolecule binding/unbinding contributes substantially to the noise, it can leads to a Lorentzian peak in addition to the 1/f background. Specifically, a p-type SiNW-FET was first modified with PSA monoclonal antibodies, then solutions with different PSA concentrations and pure buffer were sequentially delivered to the NW sensor via a microfluidic channel. In conventional time-domain measurements (Fig. 10.9d), a reliable PSA detection limit for this device was ca. 5 pM. However, the frequency domain noise spectra (Fig. 10.9e\u2013g) from the same NW-FET device showed that the Lorentzian curve shape was still clearly observed at a PSA concentration as low as 0.15 pM, ca. 30 times better than that the same device measured in the time domain. The improved detection sensitivity was attributed to the separation of the Lorentzian characteristic frequency from the most dominant background of 1/f noise, which becomes less important at high frequencies.\n",

For example, several groups have fabricated and explored double-gate NW-FET biosensor, with two separated gates, G1 (primary) and G2 (secondary), straddling both sidewalls of the SiNW, to enhance device sensitivity [65, 66]. This work has shown that by applying the same voltage to G1 and G2, the threshold voltage (V\nT) in the double gate mode is very sensitive to a small change of V\nG2 (the G2 voltage). Therefore, compared to a single-gate FET sensor, the sensing window of the double-gated FET is significantly broadened, especially in the subthreshold regime described earlier.",

            "text": "To overcome the limitation of Debye length, researchers have developed several methods to detect analytes in blood/serum samples, including simply reducing the solution ionic strength. For example, the ion concentration can be reduced by diluting a blood sample with buffer solution [68]. Dilution will reduce analyte concentration and can affect ligand- and protein-protein interactions, and thereby reduce device sensitivity. A second approach involves desalting the serum samples before detection of biomarkers [22], which can maintain or even be used to increase analyte concentrations (after dissolution in buffer). Similar to off-chip desalting using rapid size-exclusion chromatography [22], a microfluidic purification chip (MPC) can be used to pre-isolate the target molecules and then release them into a pure buffer suitable for analysis using SiNW-FET arrays [69]. A fourth method adopts a steady-state measurement instead of a real-time recording [70]. Specifically, the resistance of the SiNW is measured in a low ionic strength buffer solution after antibody functionalization. Then, the SiNW sensor is incubated with undiluted serum and subsequently washed to remove unbound proteins, followed by the measurement of the second resistance value in the buffer solution. The concentration of the target molecules can be calculated according to the resistance change before and after antibody\u2013antigen interaction. This method is independent of the ionic strength of the sample solution, thus circumventing the Debye screening in physiological fluids; however, it is subject to variations in device properties between steps since slow changes in background conductance are not followed. Other reported methods include using smaller receptors, such as aptamers [53] or antibody fragments [54], and adding biomolecule permeable polymer layers to the FET sensor [56], as discussed in Sect. 10.4.3.",

            "text": "Nonetheless, there are several areas of scientific study, which if addressed, could further push the limits of this technology for applications. First, one fundamental challenge to the ultrasensitive detection is to obtain well-defined receptor structures on nanodevice surfaces. In part, this reflects difficulties in characterizing receptor\u2013device structure at the single nanodevice level and correlating such results with sensing results. One approach that could address this structural issue at the single device level would be by exploiting the substantial advances in cyro-EM [72, 73], which could yield high-resolution structural information of the organic/biologic/nanodevice interface. A second direction that could improve this critical device-receptor interface would be through exploration of highly-selective, self-limiting covalent chemistry that precisely defines distance and orientation of the receptors. Second, the real-time and multiplexed detection capabilities of nanoelectronic FET sensors for direct analyses of whole blood/serum detection could yield important advances in clinical monitoring and diagnostics. As discussed in Sects. 10.4.3 and 10.4.8, the most critical issue has been overcoming Debye screening in physiological solutions. The new strategy of modifying FET nanodevices with a permeable polymer layer to increase the effective screening length [56] is one promising strategy for achieving real-time detection, although further fundamental studies will be necessary to develop this and/or other approaches to the level of a technology. Third, almost all the nanoFET-based sensors are exclusively surface-bound devices. For many applications, one of the most impactful directions could be the transformation from on-chip signaling to the in vivo monitoring as an implant. Recent advances in the development of NW-FET arrays embedded in engineered tissue patches [74], which could be implanted, and incorporation of sensors in injectable electronics [75], which is directly implanted in specific tissue, could enable the goal of direct in vivo monitoring.",
