            "text": "Human parvovirus B19 is a worldwide distributed single-stranded DNA virus usually infecting rapidly dividing cell lines, such as bone marrow erythroid progenitor cells.1 Most persons are infected by 15 years of age and about 80% of the population is seropositive by the age of 50 years. Infection is most common in late winter or early spring2 and occurs through exposure to infected respiratory droplets or blood products or vertically from mother to fetus. Most persons with B19 infection are asymptomatic or present mild, aspecific, cold-like symptoms. Other clinical conditions associated to parvovirus B19 infection include erythema infectiosum, arthropathy, and hydrops fetalis in immunocompetent individuals; haematologic diseases, including aplastic crisis, chronic red cell aplasia, and idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, in immunocompromised patients. A link to parvovirus B19 infection has been hypothesized for various skin eruptions, neurologic diseases, rheumatologic diseases, vasculitic and myocarditic syndromes, and autoimmune hepatitis.3, 4 Few cases of severe pulmonary disease in both immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients have been reported in literature5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13; however, at our knowledge, no study has systematically investigated the presence of parvovirus B19 in lower respiratory tract specimens.",

Multiple BAL procedures (mean, 3.2; range, 2\u20136) were performed on 30 patients. Samples from the same patient that were collected less than 2 weeks apart were excluded; each sample and episode was evaluated independently. Bronchoalveolar lavage procedure was performed for investigating the cause of unexplained fever and/or respiratory symtpoms (including dyspnea, cough, haemoptysis) and/or new infiltrates on chest X-ray or in the absence of the above-mentioned conditions for cheking up a previous positivity or as routine follow-up in lung transplant recipients at month 1 post-transplantation and subsequently at 3-month intervals. In lung transplant recipients histopathological evaluation (periodic acid-Schiff, Masson's trichrome, and haematoxylin and eosin stains) on transbronchial lung biopsy was routinely performed. The BAL procedure was carried out as previously described14 and samples were thawed and liquefied with 1:1 N-acetylcisteine.

Real-Time PCR assays were performed with the 7300 Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, Monza, Italy), by using TaqMan platform. Primers for parvovirus B19-DNA detection were designed within the VP1 and VP2 genes (accession number AY768535; primer F 5\u2032-ACATGCACACCTATTTTCCCAATAA-3\u2032, primer R 5\u2032-TGTTCCATACAGAACCCACCATT-3\u2032; probe (TAMRA) 5\u2032-AGCAATATACAGATCAAATTGAGCGCCCCC-3\u2032) using the Primer Express 3.0 Software (Applied Biosystems). The assay was carried out in 25 \u03bcl volume containing 5 \u03bcl of extracted specimen or plasmid dilution, 1\u00d7 Master Mix (Platinum qPCR supermix\u2014UDG with ROX, Invitrogen), 250 nM of each primer, 125 nM of probe. Uracil-DNA glycosylase was used to eliminate PCR \u2018carry over\u2019 contaminations from previous PCR reactions.16 The PCR cycling protocol was as follows: 50 \u00b0C for 2 min, initial denaturation step at 95 \u00b0C for 10 min, followed by 45 cycles at 95 \u00b0C for 15 s (denaturation) and 60 \u00b0C for 1 min (annealing and extension). Standard curves for the quantification of DNA were constructing by plotting the threshold cycle against the logarithm of serial 10-fold dilutions of the corresponding plasmid. Amplifications data were analyzed by the Sequence Detection System Software (Applied Biosystem). Specimens were subjected to simultaneous TaqMan PCR detection of the housekeeping gene human Glycerin-aldehyde-3-phosphate-dehydrogenase (GAPDH) as internal control, as previously described.17 Results were considered acceptable only in the presence of GAPDH with a threshold cycle (Ct) lower than 39. The assay had a detection limit of 10 copies/reaction, thus giving, based on the analytic procedure, a value of 125 genome equivalents (GEq)/ml of BAL. Dynamic range of Real-Time PCR for parvovirus B19 is shown in Fig. 1\n. A \u201cnucleotide\u2013nucleotide blast\u201d search for short nucleotide sequences performed at the National Centre of Biotechnology Information and the National Library of Medicine web site (available at: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) confirmed that the primers used should not amplify other viruses pathogenic to humans. As a confirmatory test, a nested PCR that amplifies the VP1 region of parvovirus B19 was also performed, as previously described.18\n",

            "text": "Parvovirus B19 is a common cause of infection worldwide and definitive diagnosis is made by the detection of IgM or viral DNA in serum samples, as well as B19-DNA may be detectable in respiratory secretions. Generally, B19 infection of immunocompetent individuals displays a self-limiting course followed by clearance of the virus from the host; although, in some cases, persistent infection may occur despite the presence of IgG antibodies. Beside blood and bone marrow, the persistence of parvovirus B19-DNA has been shown in skin, synovial, tonsils, liver, myocardial tissue, and kidney.19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25 Although parvovirus B19 infection and persistence have been associated with a wide range of diseases, the finding of viral DNA in different tissue specimens argued against its possible pathogenic role in some clinical contexts,22, 24 suggesting that the detection of B19-DNA is not sufficient to postulate a relationship between the virus and specific diseases. In the present study we investigated the presence and clinical impact of parvovirus B19 in BAL specimens. Few reports on parvovirus B19-associated pneumonia in immunocompromised and immunocompetent patients as a result of primary infection have been described in literature, while no study has investigated the presence of parvovirus B19-DNA in lower respiratory tract specimens from a large group of hospitalized adult patients. Based on our results, parvovirus B19-DNA was found in a small percentage of patients with different pathological backgrounds, without evidencing any significant prevalence in a specific subgroup of patients. As regards the potential relationship with a particular clinical pattern, although five of the seven positive patients presented an acute respiratory condition, in the two lung transplant recipients B19-DNA was found also in surveillance BAL. This seems to argue against a possible pathogenic role of parvovirus B19 and the virus could represent an innocent bystander, the replication of which has been favoured by the impaired pulmonary background. The chronicity of parvovirus B19 infection in cryptic sites, in the absence of viremia, because of delayed (or no) clearance from these areas has been suggested for the cerebrospinal fluid. This has been evidenced because cerebrospinal fluid is routinely taken as part of routine investigation in new cases of leukemia, the pathogenesis of which has been hypothesized to be related to parvovirus B19, and is supported by the fact that B19 is known to cause encephalitis.26 Similarly, based on our results, it is likely that another cryptic site of viral persistence is represented by the lower respiratory tract. Moreover, it is to note that viral load was moderate-low in both symptomatic and surveillance cases and that all the specimens, but one, presented at least a coinfection with another virus, mainly herpesviruses or rhinovirus. However, it may be likely that also herpesvirus DNA finding is attributable to latency in lung, as previously described.17 On the other hand, the presence of respiratory insufficiency in four of seven patients with B19 positivity in BAL specimen and frequent association with mortality within 28 days (42.9% of the cases) suggests the need for further investigation of the presence of parvovirus B19 in BAL and lung biopsy specimens and of its role in different clinical settings, such as intensive care unit.",
