S. pyogenes, which is a significant human pathogen, causes serious diseases, such as pharyngitis, skin infections, acute rheumatic fever (ARF), rheumatic heart disease (RHD), acute post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis (APSG), streptococcal toxic shock syndrome, and necrotizing fasciitis [1, 2]. In a study conducted in Turkey on the identification of GAS isolates at species level by 16S rRNA sequence analysis, S. pyogenes was found to be the most common when compared with gene bank data [3].",

            "text": "Many serious virulence factors play a role in the pathogenicity of S. pyogenes. The most notable factor is surface M protein encoded by the emm gene, showing its effect by facilitating adhesion, providing resistance to opsonophagocytosis and contributing to the overall burden of GAS infections [4, 5]. To date, more than 200 emm types and subtypes have been reported. The hyper-variable region of the emm gene forms the basis for emm typing in GAS. M protein is used as an epidemiological marker because of the different emm-type distribution in variable regions [6, 7]. emm gene sequence analysis is a useful tool to understand local transmission dynamics and geographical distribution of the emm types. Knowing the emm-type distribution of different patient populations in different regions of the same country can be used to understand local epidemiology and to determine local vaccine formulation. M protein, which is exhibited by all the strains of S. pyogenes, can be immunized in the host and is used in valuable vaccine development studies. Vaccines with 26-valves and 30-valves include streptococcal emm types that cause non-invasive (tonsillopharyngitis) and invasive infections [8, 9].",

In a study in our country, emm1 (30.9%), emm12 (14.6%), emm89 (8.1%), emm118 (7.3%), and emm4 (5.7%) were reported [20]. In the present study, 6 emm types were recovered from 13 S. pyogenes isolates.
