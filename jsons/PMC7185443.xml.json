            "text": "The aim of an outbreak detection system is to assist epidemiologists monitor the progress of a disease and raise an alert when there is an impending outbreak. An accurate and fast alarm notification system allows healthcare professionals to set up an early prevention plan before an outbreak spreads to a wider geographical area. If an outbreak is uncontrollable, it may lead to high death tolls and worse still; it kills without warning [1]. For example, the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) [2], influenza [3], [4], and the avian virus [5] led to high mortality rates shortly after the first case was detected. Beside those viruses, there are seasonal types of diseases such as malaria, dengue, cholera and many more that can be classified as having the potential to escalate to outbreaks according to the World Health Organization and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention portal. One of the indirect effects of an outbreak is that it has a detrimental economic impact on a country. This is exemplified by the SARS and avian virus outbreaks in 2003, which led to a huge loss of around US$20 million for the tourism industry in most affected Asian countries such China, Hong Kong, Singapore and Vietnam because of an ineffective surveillance system [6]. For this reason, we need to be able to rely on an accurate detection system to monitor for signs of an emerging outbreak. The importance of having such a system has been emphasized in much of the literature, not least because it can help authorities to control the spread of an outbreak and reduce the mortality rate [4], [7].",

            "text": "An outbreak is defined as a sudden spread of disease with a much greater number cases reported than expected over time, where the point of initial occurrence is a small area but quickly spreads to a wider geographic area [8]. A health surveillance system can monitor the progress of incidences of a disease over time: daily, weekly, or monthly. If there is an extraordinary pattern, this might indicate that an outbreak has started [9]. A sudden increase in the number of suspected cases from previous day is an indicator of a potential outbreak and it changes are viewed as abnormal characteristics; therefore an outbreak detection system is actually looking for anomalies in health data [10], [11]. In outbreak detection studies, an outbreak is a collective anomaly where it requires more than one case to be detected before it can be labelled as an actual outbreak [12], [13]. For example, if a single patient has been detected as having a certain disease, the alert system will not be activated until the number of similar cases has reached a certain default number. Each disease has a different default number which is determined by epidemiologists. For instance, in the case of a disease such as dengue just more than a suspected cases difference from previous day will raise an alarm while cholera requires up to 20 registered cases before it can be classified as an outbreak [14]. However, when the spread of an outbreak is slow, the number of cases is not the key indicator and further epidemiological investigation is required [15]. Asthe notification of outbreak is based on collective anomalies that need to be tailored with same locality and time, this makes outbreak detection different from other detection tasks such as intrusion, fraud and fault.",

Those methods can be classified into three main approaches: statistical [1], [9], [16], [17], [18], artificial intelligence [15], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24], [25], and a combination of these two approaches into hybrid methods [26], [27], [28]. The statistical approach was applied in early outbreak detection models and to date it remains the preferred approach in many health surveillance systems [29], [30]. One of the key issues that needs to be addressed in existing models is how to obtain a high detection rate while at the same time reducing the false alarm rate. However, due to the weakness of the outbreak signal which always behaves under uncertainties, existing systems produce an inconsistent false alarm rate during detection. Here, uncertainty refers to inconsistent outbreak signals, where the outbreak pattern frequently changes and differs between years. This means that a trained model has less capability in terms of robustness particularly when unseen outbreak patterns vary from the trained model. Robustness is also lost when detection algorithms require a sample from both an outbreak and non-outbreak session for model development. However, in practice, it is a challenging task to define a sample for an outbreak period because most of the data available relate only to non-outbreak periods.",

However, due to the weakness of the outbreak signal, the possibility of these models generating an imbalanced result between detection rate and false alarm rate is high because they rely on a single attribute [28]. As a possible solution to this problem of a weak signal, researchers have been investigating the use of multivariate surveillance by injecting the weak signal with a stronger signal, for instance by combining spatial and temporal data [1], [16], [32]. In addition, efforts have been made to combine multiple syndromic data to boost detection, for instance by combining emergency visit data with weather information, or clinical diagnosis results [33], [34] and by investigating social network status and internet tracking search [22], [35], [36]. Since an outbreak is observed over time, distraction factors such as the seasonal event effect always disturb the detection results [9]. In relation to the data issue, each disease has a different outbreak definition which is determined by its the environment, government policies, outbreak rate and the medium for spread. Information on aspects such as outbreak duration (outbreak period), outbreak magnitude (rate of outbreak cases) and onset date are required and they are different depending on the disease [7]. The above-mentioned factors indirectly influence the effectiveness of an outbreak algorithm. Fig. 1\ndepicts the general outbreak detection concept.",

In this paper, an outbreak detection model based on danger theory is proposed. Danger theory is a bio-inspired method that replicates how the human body fights pathogens and the literature has shown that it can solve problems mainly related to the detection process. While not many works that apply danger theory have addressed the outbreak detection problem, danger theory has been successfully applied in intrusion [37], [38], fraud [39], [40], and fault detection problems [41] with good detection performance. Since the capability of danger theory as a good detector is proven in other areas, it motivates us to adapt the artificial immune system (AIS) as an outbreak detection model. The robustness of the immune system mostly lies in the ability of the dendrite cell to sense an early death cell (viewed as an outbreak signal), which can be replicated in an outbreak detection model to reduce the high false alarm rate. Moreover, danger theory offers a multivariate detection approach without relying on a training phase, which can improve a model's robustness.",

The key point of danger theory is that the immune system only reacts to the danger signal which will do harm to health.

It relies on the function of dendrite cells, a family of cells known as macrophages. As an antigen presenting cell, the dendrite cell controls the activation state of T-cells in the lymph nodes and it has three different states, namely immature state, semi-mature state and mature state. At the beginning of the detection process, the dendrite cells, which are initially born as immature cells in thymus, observe the progress of the body's cells. At this stage, the dendrite cell collects the body cell protein paired with its three signals; pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMP), danger, and safe signal in cell tissue as shown in Fig. 2\n. Based on the collected input throughout its life span, the dendrite cell will evolve from being immature into one of two maturation states: either a semi-mature (apoptotic death) or a mature state (necrotic death). At this phase, the dendrite cell is migrated from cell tissue to lymph node. Reaching a \u2018mature\u2019 state indicates that the cell has experienced more danger signals throughout its life span that have been caused by a foreign antigen, wound, etc. If this happen, it indicates that the harmful antigen has been detected and a danger zone will be released. From a mature state, T-cells are activated to release antibody. While a \u2018semi-mature\u2019 state indicates that apoptotic death has occurred and this is seen as part of normal cell function. The semi mature dendrite cells cannot activate T-Cells and they are tolerized to the presented antigen.",

Since the identification of the cause of cell distress (either apoptosis or necrosis) is the key for antigen detection in the human body, it provides a solution to overcome the uncertainty problem in early outbreak signals. In this context, all outbreak datasets are considered as antigens and all of them have a similar chance of being affected by foreign antigens.

In a conventional immune system approach, some of the antigens have to be predefined as self cells (the training set) but in practice, the self cells are difficult to define and can change over time.

The early work in this field was initiated by Greensmith et al. [44], who incorporated the biological danger theory approach into a DCA. This type of algorithm is able to detect network intrusion with better performance compared to negative selection algorithms. Later, a more sensitive version of the DCA was proposed which included new controllable parameters [45]. Following successful trials, danger theory has been applied to address a wide range of computer security network issues such as malicious code detection, misbehaviour in wireless networks, port scanning, spyware, and worm detection [37], [38], [46], [47], [48], [49], [50], [51], [52], [53], [54]. Besides providing accurate detection with a lower false alarm rate, the danger theory framework can be applied as an agent in huge real-time heterogonous networks [55], [56], [57], [58]. In line with this, other recent work demonstrates that the danger theory framework can be implemented in real-time flood detection in a big scalable environment with fast response to pattern changes [54]. Moreover, it has been found that detection sensitivity towards intruders increases when danger theory is hybridized with other detection approaches such a negative selection algorithm [38], [59].",

For example in fraud detection, the danger theory approach is hybridized with a negative selection algorithm to detect fraudulent online video-on-demand transactions [39], [60] as well as fraud in runtime malware for Windows processes [40]. Inspired by dendrite cell function, danger theory has also been implemented in the area of fault detection. For example, Ran, et al. [41] adopt the idea of the DCA to diagnose faults in robots and control systems. In line with their work, Prieto, Nino, & Quintana [61] have proved the ability of danger theory as an efficient detector in control systems. They propose the DTAL, which is a goalkeeper strategy in robot soccer. In addition, danger theory has also been successfully applied to detect faults in task scheduling where each job to be scheduled is considered as an antigen and aligned with the cell signal [62]. Other successful applications for fault diagnosis can be seen in Laurentys, Palhares, & Caminhas [63] and Zhou, Fan, & Zhang [64]. As well as acting as an anomaly detector, danger theory has also performed well in other data mining task such as filtering web documents [65] and image classification [66].",

However, where the attribute may or may not indicate an anomalous situation but the probability of an anomaly is higher under normal circumstances and is labelled as a danger signal [43]. Categorical data need to be transformed into numerical data since the DCA only functions in numerical form. For transformation, the categorical value of an attribute is replaced with the total reported cases in a day. For example, the reported symptoms attribute in the WSARE dataset [67] has four categories which are none, respiratory, nausea, and rash. The registered cases in day X are counted according to the attribute value, as shown in Fig. 7\n.",

Since an outbreak is only indicated when there is a sudden increase in cases, the lower side CUSUM is ignored. So, to normalize, the upper side CUSUM is applied, as shown in Eq.

For the dengue dataset, attribute selection is based on expert suggestions while in WSARE, the selection is based on [28]. Table 1 summarizes the attribute-signal assignment. The attribute assignment to an appropriate signal is important since it will affect the capability of the DCA to discriminate any anomalies accurately. For example, in the WSARE dataset, the number of cases in winter and autumn (seasonal attribute) is assigned to the PAMP signal because flu incidence rates are high during this period . Conversely, in summer and spring the number of cases falls, therefore both of these seasons are assigned to the safe signal. The general guideline to select and assign attribute to appropriate dendrite cell signal is based on the signal behaviour itself as follows:\u2022PAMP: Their existence indicates an anomalous situation\u2022Safe: Their presence indicates no anomalous situation is present\u2022Danger: Their occurrence may or may not indicate an anomalous situation but the probability of an anomaly is higher than in the normal situation.\n",

First, danger theory overcomes the inconsistent outbreak signal problem. This can be seen from how danger theory perceives the input data. In danger theory, all data inputs are considered as antigens where they have a similar chance of becoming infected with a harmful pathogen. Based on the generated MCAV that represents the antigen life experience, it determines whether the antigen has died due to infection (outbreak) or not (non-outbreak). Since outbreak and non-outbreak periods are hard to define in real life, danger theory eliminates the assignment of input data to both of these periods during model development. Therefore, there is no need for a training phase and or a pre-developed model in danger theory. This is in contrast to some other detection approaches such as MLP and NB, where the model must first be trained. As a result, the robustness of these models can decrease when the unseen pattern is not the same as that learned during the training phase. Based on the experiments, danger theory can highly discriminate between outbreaks and non-outbreaks with consistent detection results even though no training phase is involved. Moreover, since no training phase is required, the proposed model is able to process real-time input and has high potential for implementation as a real-time system.",

            "text": "Second, danger theory is a multivariate detection approach. In a biological immune system, a dendrite cell processes three input signals (PAMP, danger, safe) into three output signals (CSM, mature, semi-mature). During this process, DCA may accept various inputs in term of cell protein and classify them either into PAMP, danger, or safe. As an outbreak signal is often weak and not consistent, the use of multiple input factors may improve detection performance in comparison to those methods that rely on a single predictive factor [28]. As an example, three attributes for a dengue outbreak (average humidity, average temperature and average rainfall) are taken as inputs for the danger signal while the emergency visit statistic is assigned to either a PAMP or safe signal. From this mixture of multiple input factors, the DCA generates a better result detection performance compared to the univariate approach (CUSUM, EWMA, and MA). Moreover, the experimental result for SARS outbreak detection also indicates a similar performance. Hence, the DCA indirectly improves on the CUSUM result. This can be clearly seen from in the results for both outbreak datasets where DCA and CUSUM generated a comparable DR; however, the DCA performs better than CUSUM in terms of FAR and SPS. This indicates that the multivariate approach offered by danger theory can increase outbreak detection performance.",

            "text": "Inspired by the success of other detection-based solutions in the literature, this study proposed a novel outbreak detection model based on danger theory. In the proposed model, a signal formalization approach based on CUSUM was formalized and a cumulative mature antigen contact value (cMCAV) was employed to suit the outbreak characteristic and danger theory. Based on experiments performed on two outbreak datasets, dengue and SARS, the proposed model was found to be more robust than other available models when dealing with inconsistent outbreak signals. Although there is no training phase involved, the danger theory-based outbreak detection model is able to handle new unknown outbreak patterns and can highly discriminate outbreak and non-outbreak cases with a consistent high DR, high SNS, and lower FAR. This can be seen in the case of the dengue outbreak dataset, where the proposed model produced significantly better results than CUSUM, EWMA, moving average, multilayer perceptron, and na\u00efve Bayes. Also, in the case of the SARS outbreak dataset, the proposed model produced a performance that was comparable to that of EWMA. Since danger theory is a multivariate approach, it offers a new alternative for outbreak detection that can deal with vague and inconsistent outbreak signals for different types of data. To further evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed model, further analysis will be conducted on different outbreak diseases, where the performance of the proposed model will be investigated when dealing with different outbreak shifts. The proposed outbreak detection model will also be extended as a real-time agent-based model.",
