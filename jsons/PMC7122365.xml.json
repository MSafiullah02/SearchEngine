Over the past decade, public health and medical communities have been challenged by several novel infectious disease outbreaks. Some of these outbreaks have been naturally occurring, such as the international SARS outbreak in 2003 [1]. Other outbreaks originated from biological agents that were intentionally released into the population, such as the anthrax letters sent to several persons in the United States in the fall of 2001 [2]. These incidents, as well as simulated bioterrorism exercises such as Dark Winter and the TOPOFF drills, have led to increased awareness of potential shortcomings of our public health and healthcare systems to respond to emerging disease threats [3\u20137]. The specter of future outbreaks has prompted Americans to consider a number of legal and ethical issues associated with preparation for and response to biological terrorism.",

Infectious agents provide an attractive tool for potential terrorists. Unlike explosives, bombs and other conventional weapons of terror, the bioterrorist\u2019s weapon is often less expensive to obtain, easier to smuggle, easier to spread across a wide segment of the population, and in some cases easier to deploy. Moreover, a highly infectious microorganism can spread rapidly across borders and boundaries, affecting multiple areas. The invisibility of biological weapons further adds to their ability to create fear and havoc. Biological agents may be difficult to detect until after they have exacted serious damage. Most experts agree that there is a plausible risk in the United States of a large-scale bioterrorism attack that could result in significant illnesses or casualties [9\u201317]. Consequently, proactive preparations for bioterrorism, even more so than other types of terrorism, involve systematic planning, ongoing training, and redistributions of resources.",

These efforts have targeted a wide range of relevant and intersecting areas. Strengthening the public health workforce, infrastructure, and capacity available to respond to an outbreak associated with biological terrorism, is critical. Policy-makers have responded by increasing training and funding to these areas [18\u201320]. Similarly, planners within the public and private sectors have established tactics and procedures to respond to various emergency scenarios. These plans frequently consider methods to improve communications between various emergency responders and others who must have sufficient capability to contact each other in an emergency situation. Preparedness planning efforts targeting bioterrorism have occurred concurrently with initiatives to bolster public health infrastructure for other public health emergencies including natural disasters (e.g., hurricanes) and naturally occurring disease outbreaks (e.g., pandemic influenza). Finally, preparedness planners have considered some of the ethical concerns raised by bioterrorism attacks and their potentially devastating consequences.",

Law is a critical component of a well-developed public health system [21]. Public health law grants public health agencies powers to detect, track, prevent, and contain health threats resulting from bioterrorism and other public health emergencies. However, many existing public health and emergency response laws at the state and federal levels may not be sufficient to address biological terrorism. These laws often do not grant public health authorities the necessary powers to stop an outbreak. Public health laws vary widely across different jurisdictions. As a result, the legal powers ascribed to public health officials may be different in scope and function in different locales. These laws are also commonly targeted to specific diseases or conditions that may not relate to emerging threats [22].",

The federal government will normally become involved in localized public health matters only at the request of the state or if the disease has the potential to cross state or international borders, or affect interstate interests.

Indeed, an outbreak may traverse international boundaries as well, which would clearly entail the input of the federal government. Bioterrorism implicates additional concerns beyond public health, including national security and law enforcement considerations. Federal public health and legal authorities may specifically respond to multiple components of a bioterrorism attack, as well as offer guidance and expertise to assist state and local governments in their responses. Thus, responses to bioterrorism require sufficient legal powers at both the federal and state levels, in addition to a well-conceived plan for coordinating these powers to maximize public benefit.",

Balancing these goals requires difficult choices that are further complicated when public health laws are unclear, poorly drafted, or confusing. To assist state and local law- and policy-makers, public health law scholars at the Center for Law and the Public\u2019s Health at Georgetown University Law Center and the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health drafted two model state public health acts. The Model State Emergency Health Powers Act (MSEHPA) was drafted quickly after September 11, 2001, with input from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and multiple national partner organizations [25, 26]. Completed on December 21, 2001, MSEHPA has served as a valuable template for states to modernize their public health laws to address public health emergencies, including emergencies caused by bioterrorism. It provides a modern framework for public health powers, authorizing state and local authorities to engage in a range of activities to address a public health emergency. These measures may restrict temporarily the liberty or property of affected individuals or groups to protect the public\u2019s health [27]. To date, 44 states and the District of Columbia have introduced bills based on some or all of the provisions of the MSEHPA, and 38 states and the District of Columbia have passed their respective bills [28].",

These differences are evident in the structural distribution of power between the state and local governments and the substantive criteria (or lack thereof) for placing an individual under quarantine. Some states have a centralized public health system that retains most public health powers at the state level, including quarantine and isolation decisions. Other states delegate these decisions to local public health agencies. In these states, quarantine will generally be under the jurisdiction of local public health officials when the disease is confined to a discrete local area. If the outbreak affects more that one community within the state, the state public health authority will usually have the power to implement quarantine or isolation orders. Very few jurisdictions have articulated explicit procedures and policies to determine whether or not an individual should be subject to quarantine. Both the MSEHPA and Turning Point Act propose a systematic process for making this determination that considers the exigencies of the situation. Furthermore, they allow for an appeal of the decision if possible under the circumstances [25, 29].",

The Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) has statutory responsibility for preventing the introduction, transmission, and spread of communicable diseases from foreign countries into the United States and within the United States and its territories/possessions [40]. Regulations grant the CDC authority to detain, medically examine, or conditionally release individuals reasonably believed to be carrying a communicable disease [41]. The CDC\u2019s Division of Global Migration and Quarantine has the specific authority to quarantine individuals seeking to enter the United States. U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) (formerly the U.S. Customs Service) and officers of the U.S. Coast Guard are authorized to assist in the enforcement of federal quarantine orders [42]. Personnel from the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) (formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service [INS]), the CBP, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFW) all assist the CDC in identifying travelers or other persons who may be infected with illnesses that pose a risk to public health [43]. Federal quarantine authority only extends to specific diseases enumerated by executive order [44]. However, this list of diseases can be amended quickly when necessary (e.g., as with SARS in 2003, and pandemic flu in 2005) [45, 46].",

This is problematic because the imposition of a large-scale quarantine will almost certainly involve the use of federal and state powers. Under these circumstances, there is the possibility of confusion and controversy over who is in charge. As past bioterrorism simulations and real emergencies like Hurricane Katrina have demonstrated, if the lines of authority are not clear to officials at all government levels, the public health response can be paralyzed and undermined [3, 4, 47, 48]. Thus, in addition to improving the legal framework within federal and state/local jurisdictions, serious efforts should focus on establishing a coordinated public health response between these jurisdictions.",

            "text": "When should public health authorities use quarantine or isolation to restrict individuals during a bioterrorism emergency? The response to this question requires the decision-maker to balance the need for restrictive intervention with the effect it may have on the civil liberties of affected individuals. Modern commentary on the acceptability of quarantine asks whether the risk to the population posed by the disease justifies such a serious loss of liberty [21, 49, 50]. In addition to restrictions on liberty, imposing a quarantine temporarily deprives individuals of their economic livelihood, their right to travel or associate freely with others, and may subject them to stigma and discrimination. In a time of great crisis, public sentiment may strongly support such measures, but public sentiment alone is an insufficient justification to use quarantine powers. These powers may be warranted to prevent the continued transmission of a disease that presents a serious risk to the population. It is important, however, that restrictive powers are not used unnecessarily or as an artifice for discrimination [51]. Past quarantines in the United States have led to violence [52], increased disease transmission among the quarantined population [53], and biased decision making [54]. In one case, a federal court invalidated a quarantine imposed on an area of San Francisco comprised mostly of persons of Chinese descent, finding that the public health officials had used an \u201cevil eye and an unequal hand\u201d in issuing their quarantine order [55].",

            "text": "Gostin has outlined several criteria for exercising restrictive public health powers under modern constitutional law [21, 51]:\nCompelling state interest in confinement. Public health authorities must only resort to restrictive powers when there is a compelling interest that is substantially furthered by civil confinement. Only truly dangerous individuals (i.e., posing a significant risk of transmission) can be confined. Whenever possible, risks should be assessed through scientific means.\nTargeted intervention. Individually restrictive measures should be well targeted to achieving public health objectives. Interventions that deprive individuals of liberty or equal protection without justification may be constitutionally impermissible. For example, placing everyone within a geographic area under quarantine is overinclusive if some members would not transmit infection. Underinclusive interventions that confine some, but not all, potentially contagious persons may be found to be arbitrary or intentionally discriminatory.\nLeast-restrictive alternative. Public health authorities should not implement extremely restrictive measures such as quarantine and isolation if they can accomplish their objectives through less drastic means (although it is not likely that they would be required to enact extreme or unduly expensive means to avoid confinement).\nSafe and habitable environment. Quarantine and isolation are intended to promote well-being rather than to punish. Therefore, individuals being confined should have access to clean living conditions, food, clothing, water, adequate health care, and means to communicate with others outside the quarantine.\nProcedural due process. Individuals subject to confinement for public health purposes must be able to access some form of procedural due process depending on the nature and duration of the restraint. Where possible, this process should occur before confinement. If emergency circumstances demand immediate confinement, individuals have the right to request a speedy hearing and counsel to contest their confinement.\n",

Case reporting is a form of passive surveillance involving the routine submission of data to a public health agency by external sources such as health care professionals and laboratories, often pursuant to mandatory legal requirements [56, 57]. Through disease surveillance and reporting, public health authorities may assess the magnitude of the outbreak and appropriately target resources and tactics [21]. Surveillance and case reporting raise privacy concerns since the reports usually contain identifiable data, which could include a person\u2019s name or other identifying characteristics.
