Selected patients should have microbiological studies for tuberculosis and legionella infection. The preferred tests for detection of Legionella species are the urinary antigen assay for Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1 and culture with selective media. The rationale for performing microbiological studies to establish an etiologic diagnosis is based on attempts to improve care of the individual patient with pathogen-specific treatment; to improve care of other patients and to advance knowledge by detecting epidemiologically important organisms (Legionella, penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus); to implement contacttracing and antimicrobial prophylaxis in appropriate settings (such as cases of Neisseria meningitidis infection, Haemophilus influenzae type B infection, and tuberculosis); to prevent antibiotic abuse; and to reduce antibiotic expense.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "Antimicrobial therapy.

Intravenous antibiotics may be switched to oral agents when the patient is improving clinically, is hemodynamically stable, and is able to ingest drugs. Most patients show a clinical response within 3-5 days. Changes evident on chest radiographs usually lag behind the clinical response, and repeated chest radiography is generally not indicated for patients who respond.

S. pneumoniae, the most common identifiable etiologic agent of pneumonia in virtually all studies, accounts for about two-thirds of bacteremic pneumonia cases, and pneumococci are the most frequent cause of lethal community-acquired pneumonia.

The activity of macrolides and doxycycline or other b-lactams, including cefuroxime, is good against penicillin-susceptible strains but less predictable with strains that show reduced penicillin-susceptibility. Vancomycin, linezolid, and quinupristin/ dalfopristin are the only drugs with predictable in vitro activity.

The abil-ity to accurately predict medical outcomes in cases of CAP has a major impact on management.

Furthermore, such rules discount the cumulative importance of multiple simultaneous physiological derangements, especially if each derangement alone does not reach the threshold that defines an abnormal value (e.g., systolic blood pressure of 90/40 mm Hg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths/ min, and pulse of 120 beats/min).
