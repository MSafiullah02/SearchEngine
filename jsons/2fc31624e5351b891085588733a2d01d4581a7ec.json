Standard models, e.g., the SIR model [1] , have stressed on the importance of finding the susceptible cases to flatten the growth rate of the spread of infection as early as possible. In the present scientific world, location traces in the form of GPS coordinates are logged by mobile device manufacturing and their operating systems developing companies, such as Apple, Samsung, Google etc. However, due to the sensitive nature of this data, it is usually not shared with other organizations, mainly to protect individual privacy. However, in disaster situations, such as epidemics, data in the form of location traces of a community of people can potentially be helpful to proactively locate susceptible people from the community and enforce quarantine on them as early as possible.",

Specifically, we describe a system, named InfecTracer 1 , that seeks to find out cases of close proximity of a person with another infected person. Since a naive approach of pairwise checking on billions of check-in records is clearly not scalable, we employ an indexingbased solution (similar in principle to what is used in standard web search systems). First, we index billions of check-in records (analogous to indexing web pages). Second, a number of records in this index is marked to be infected (due to available information of reported infection). Third, given the location trace of each infected person (analogous to a keyword-based query executed on a web search system), we find out a list of susceptible people (analogous to the 10 blue links found by Google in response to a query). Merging the results for each infected person in a community thus gives a list of all susceptible people for whom appropriate measures can then be undertaken.",

However, to model an infectious disease spread, we need to have users that came in close contact with each other (in terms of both space and time). We undertake a simple simulation model to generate pseudo-user interactions (likely contacts). First, we filter the 'data.txt' file to retain only one check-in per user. This makes the simulation algorithm easier to manage. Next, for each user 'U' (having a unique id), we generate a set of mutually exclusive 'pseudo-users' or 'ghost-users', which comprises the ground-truth information for each user. Note that since all the original/real user check-ins were sufficiently apart in space-time coordinates, it is likely that the neighbourhood of a user comprised of the ghost-user check-ins are also far apart (in which case one can rely with sufficient confidence on the simulated ground-truth data). For each user 'U' we generate p+n number of ghost-user in \u03b4 neighbourhood, out of them 'p' number of ghostusers are belong to \u03f5 neighbourhood, if user U is positively infected person then these 'p' ghost-users will be considered as vulnerable person, whom we need to identify, and remaining 'n' people will be considered as non-suspicious persons as they are in safe distance from the infected person 'U'.
