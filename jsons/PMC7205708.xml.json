This process is enacted through numerous means, including the construction and adoption of stereotypes (Hogg, 2000). To this end, there is a tendency to broadly classify people into distinct groups based on demographic characteristics, such as age and gender, and to make generalized assumptions about the \u201ctypical\u201d attitudes, values, and behaviors of all members in a given group that distinguish them from members of other groups. In particular, we often see sentiments that members of one generational group are markedly different in various ways from members of another generation. Such differences are noted across domains, for example, members of certain generations are often chided for \u201ckilling\u201d various industries (e.g., napkins, Koncius, 2016; cereal, Severson, 2016; fabric softener, Terlep, 2016). Generational explanations for behavior can likewise be seen across domains of study in the organizational sciences (see Costanza, Badger, Fraser, Severt, & Gade, 2012; Zabel, Biermeier-Hanson, Baltes, Early, & Shepard, 2017 for meta-analyses), including vocational behavior (e.g., Holtschlag, Masuda, Reiche, & Morales, 2020).",

As a way of making sense of this crisis, researchers and practitioners may be tempted to seek out generational explanations to understand the impacts of COVID-19 for workers, and especially their careers and career development. Despite this, we strongly caution against the application of \u201cgenerationalized\u201d explanations for COVID-19, especially to understand careers and career development (see related arguments offered by Rudolph & Zacher, 2020). Generationalized explanations are those the rest upon the assumptions that (1) distinct generations exist, (2) there are demonstrable differences between generations, and (3) these differences can be empirically studied. Unfortunately, each of these assumptions represents a \u201cmyth\u201d about generations that does not hold up to logical or empirical scrutiny. The assumptions that support generationalized explanations are dependent on one-another, forming a logical \u201chouse of cards,\u201d wherein falsifying any single assumption invalidates the entire idea of generations and generational differences. In our previous work, we have outlined these issues in some detail, so we only allude to them briefly here (see Rudolph, 2015; Rudolph and Zacher, 2015, Rudolph and Zacher, 2017; Zacher, 2015).",

Simply put, generations exist because we think that they do; we will them into being. Generations provide a convenient way for us to describe otherwise complex phenomena associated with human aging into simpler, if not consequently reductive and deterministic terms (Walker, 1993). Generations and assumed differences between them are socially constructed through numerous mechanisms, for example, these ideas are born from and reinforced by the media, often through sensationalized headlines (e.g., Glazer, 2020). Moreover, some scientists and organizational consultants financially benefit from promoting the idea that, despite weak or non-existent empirical evidence, generational differences exist (e.g., by selling popular press books, by conducting trainings and workshops). As suggested by Rudolph and Zacher (2020), we are already seeing a generationalized rhetoric of COVID-19 emerging (see also Ayalon et al., 2020).",

Of particular note, the conflation of cohort and period effects bears some consideration, especially to the extent that one is attributed to the other. Factors that occur contemporaneously and that are experienced broadly (e.g., economic conditions, global pandemics) manifest as period effects, not as cohort (i.e., generational) effects.

We fully recognize that generations are a convenient way of explaining colloquially the uncertainties associated with COVID-19. However, this convenience does not make for good science. At best, it represents a misguided effort. At worst, it opens up the possibilities of generationalism (Rauvola, Rudolph, & Zacher, 2019). To circumvent this issue, we strongly recommend that vocational behavior researchers adopt a lifespan development perspective for understanding the impacts of COVID-19 on workers of all ages, regardless of assumptions made about their generation (see Rudolph, 2016; Rudolph & Zacher, 2017). The lifespan development framework has a long history in vocational behavior research (e.g., Vondracek, Lerner, & Schulenberg, 1986), which makes it an ideal fit to the types of research and practice questions that would otherwise give rise to generationalized explanations. In following our advice to adopt a lifespan development perspective, vocational behavior researchers could attempt to understand how the effectiveness of individuals' personal and contextual resources (e.g., capacities for emotion regulation, social support) for coping with specific demands imposed by the pandemic (e.g., increased work demands, social isolation) change with age. Additionally, vocational behavior researchers could investigate various career and life management strategies (e.g., primary and secondary control striving; Heckhausen & Tomasik, 2002; selection, optimization, compensation; Wiese, Freund, & Baltes, 2000) that people use to successfully manage transitions from school to work, from employment to unemployment, from work to retirement, and vice-versa, during the COVID-19 pandemic.",

However, other problems, like understanding the impacts of a global pandemic on work, and especially people's careers and career development, require more nuanced and complex explanations and solutions. Generations are a vastly oversimplified framework for understanding behavior in any context, and in particular in the workplace. We urge caution to researchers and practitioners to overcome the tendency to classify and divide people along generationalized lines, in favor of more comprehensive and rigorous theorizing and explanations for behaviors during these trying times.",
