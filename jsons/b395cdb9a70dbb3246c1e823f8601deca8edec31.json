It is important to note that the proposed measures are based on current limited understanding of the incubation period, mechanisms of transmission, clinical course and the duration of infectivity. As well, the evidence supporting the use of these measures is largely based on prior experience from other coronaviruses (e.g., SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV). Figure 1 summarizes CAG guidance on infection prevention and control for COVID-19 when performing endoscopic procedures (as of March 16, 2020).",

            "text": "\u2022 Risk assessment and stratification of patients should occur prior to any endoscopic procedure. There should be specific triage protocol in place to stratify the risk of COVID-19 upon patient arrival, and ideally prior to arrival as well. This strategy should be repeatedly adjusted based on the rapidly evolving local and global epidemiology of COVID-19. \u2022 All endoscopy facilities should develop standard operating procedures for COVID-19 prevention and control measures in conjunction with local infection control team members, and share these widely among staff members. \u2022 Aerosol-generating medical procedures carry a high risk of COVID-19 transmission. Upper GI procedures are considered high-risk procedures. Therefore, airborne, contact and droplet precautions with appropriate selection and use of PPE including filtering face-piece (e.g., N95, FFP2/3), gloves, gown, facial protection (e.g., goggles and/or face shield) and hairnet are required. Given that community transmission from apparently asymptomatic patients with COVID-19 has already been documented in China and Italy, and now in Canada, and the fact that the prevalence of the disease is likely to be underestimated due to limited testing and restricted criteria for testing in Canada, we suggest regarding all upper GI procedures as high-risk procedures regardless of whether patients are considered low or high risk for COVID-19. This suggestion deviates from Repici et al. 1 \u2022 Although COVID-19 viral RNA has been detected in fecal samples from suspected cases suggesting possible fecal-oral transmission, there is currently insufficient evidence to con-Journal of the Canadian Association of Gastroenterology, 2020, XX(XX), 1-3 doi: 10.1093/jcag/gwaa012 Letter to Editor sider lower GI procedures high-risk procedures for COVID-19 transmission. However, more evidence may change this consideration. The use of appropriate PPE including surgical masks, gloves, gown, eye protection (e.g., goggles) and hairnet are recommended for non-high-risk procedures. \u2022 When any endoscopic procedures are being performed on patients considered to be at high risk for COVID-19 infection, airborne, contact and droplet precautions with appropriate selection and use of PPE including filtering face-piece (e.g., N95, FFP2/3), gloves, gown, facial protection (e.g., goggles and/or face shield) and hairnet. should be used. \u2022 Given potential staff shortages through illness, selfquarantine and isolation, or redeployment, endoscopy facil-ities should discuss locally and consider whether to reduce nonessential endoscopic activities (e.g., screening and surveillance for polyps, Barrett's esophagus, etc.) to help reduce or delay the spread of COVID-19 during this outbreak. \u2022 In patients with known or highly suspected COVID-19 infection, endoscopic procedures should only be performed if strongly indicated. \u2022 Given the limited resources of N95, each institution will have to decide on the criteria for 'essential' GI procedures. If the resources are too low, the institution may have to severely restrict GI procedures to only life-threatening GI bleeding, obstruction of esophagus by food bolus or foreign body and ascending cholangitis. Guidance may rapidly change with increasing evidence and understanding of the epidemiology of COVID-19. a Endoscopy facilities should define and repeatedly adjust criteria for essential endoscopic procedures, based on the rate of loss of personnel and resources, and the rapidly evolving local and global epidemiology of COVID-19. Given the limited resources of N95, each institution will have to decide on the criteria for essential GI procedures. If the resources are too low, the institution may have to severely restrict GI procedures to only life-threatening GI bleeding, obstruction of esophagus by food bolus or foreign body, and ascending cholangitis. b Risk assessment and stratification of patients should be repeatedly adjusted based on rapidly evolving local and global epidemiology of COVID-19. c Upper GI procedures are considered high risk procedures for COVID-19 transmission.
