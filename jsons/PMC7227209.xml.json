R0 of COVID-19 was initially estimated to be 2.2 to 2.7; however, as more data are available with time, some epidemiologists suggested that the true R0 of this virus could be much higher and lies between 3.3 and 5.47, or even higher between 4.7 and 6.6.7,8 In contrast, R0 of SARS-CoV were 1.88 in Beijing, 1.70 in Hong Kong, and 0.95 worldwide,9,10 where R0 of MERS-CoV were 0.47 in Middle East, 0.45 in Saudi Arabia, and 0.91 overall for Middle East and South Korea.10,11 The infectivity of COVID-19 is, therefore, highest among the 3 lethal coronavirus infections. The CFR, however, has a reverse order for the 3 viruses when comparing with infectivity. They are 6.7%, 9.6%, and 34.4% for COVID-19, SARS, and MERS, respectively.12",

Therefore, it is expected that this new virus would behave very similar to SARS-CoV in terms of transmission properties, such as causing lower instead of upper respiratory tract symptoms.13 However, unlike SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV, epithelial cells in human airway are more suitable than standard tissue culture medium for the growth of SARS-CoV-2.13 Moreover, the incubation period of this virus is up to 24 days and the virus is capable of transmitting the disease even when patients only have mild or even no symptoms.14 Unlike SARS in which most patients developed fever, studies from China and Europe showed only 43% to 48% of them had fever at the time of admission.15,16 This renders comprehensive early identification of cases extremely difficult. Lastly, the low CFR of the disease relative to SARS and MERS may make people more complacent and less compliant with preventive measures. With global spread, the role of quarantine is to slow or stop the transmission of infection so that serious cases are at least spread over a longer period of time. An uncontrolled outbreak of infection could easily overwhelm the ability to care for patients and lead to exponential spread. All of the aforementioned characteristics of COVID-19 facilitate the transmission of virus in the community thus increasing the difficulty of its containment. Further studies to investigate the mechanisms for COVID-19's high infectivity are warranted.",

One major common property is that they utilize filters to prevent unwanted substances from passing through the barrier, while allowing air to pass through.30 Filters can capture particles of different size through various mechanisms. Larger particles are captured by filter fibers directly when they impact or intercept the fibers. Smaller particles are constantly bombarded by air molecules, causing them to deviate from the air stream and come into contact with a fiber. Furthermore, oppositely charged particles are attracted to charged fiber. All particles that come into contact with a fiber will stay attached to the fiber firmly. In that way, filters can capture particles smaller than the pore size. Structures and mechanisms of various filter materials are illustrated in Figure 4.",

A clear polyvinyl chloride document holder is a good choice. Make a central opening and fit it in between the optical modules. The edges of the shield should be smoothen with a sand paper polisher should it be too rough or sharp. The size of the shield should not be too small in which protection effect will be compromised; or too large in which manipulation of the slit-lamp equipment will become difficult. The size of an A3 size paper or one that is slightly larger would be quite optimal and recommended. The location of the hole is also important.
