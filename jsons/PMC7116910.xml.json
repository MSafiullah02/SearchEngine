Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) caused worldwide severe epidemic outbreak in 2003 [1]. Air was verified as one of the SARS transmission pathways across built environments by the epidemiological proof and numerical simulation [2]. Airborne transmission was also proved as an important mode of Influenza A virus spread [3,4]. For animal production, above 50 million chickens and turkeys in USA died of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) or were destroyed to prevent the disease spread between December 2014 and June 2015, involving Iowa and Minnesota and other adjacent states [[5], [6], [7]]. Evidences obtained from both laboratory-simulated process and field investigation supported the existence of airborne transmission of HPAI virus [8,9].",

Laboratory-scale manual controlled experiments had proved that short distance airborne transmission of several infectious pathogens could occur from animal to animal [8,[10], [11], [12]]. Field studies, mostly focused on human cases and presented as evidences of airborne transmission between individuals, rooms or residential buildings, had also demonstrated the existence of airborne transmission of virus and bacteria [2,[13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20]]. Homology detection using ERIC-PCR and REP-PCR was applied in animal farm to conduct the source identification of airborne E. coli surrounding swine house [21]. The airborne transmission of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRS) between buildings and via long spatial distance were supported based on virus homology between sampling points [22,23]. Still, it was challenged to directly certify the air transmission of microorganism by homology detection due to its inability to suppress the interference of surrounding microorganism. Results-orientated research of airborne transmission neglected the transporting process of the microorganism in the air and was lack of quantitative description of airborne pathogen concentration. Tracer was required to express the movement and decay of airborne microorganism in both experiment and numerical simulation.",

            "text": "To comprehend the route of airborne transmission, tracer had been applied into both lab and field experiment. Tracer gases such as N2O, SF6, R134a and He were widely used to investigate the spread of airborne microorganism in indoor and outdoor environment by means of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) for its quantitative evaluation of the cross-infection risks and low-budget [[24], [25], [26], [27], [28], [29], [30]]. However, airborne microorganism transporting process across built environments was unable to be interpreted thoroughly by tracer gases for their distinct absence of physical and biological characteristics of airborne microorganism. In CFD, the tracer gases were generally represented by passive scalars, which were just following the air movement. Particles (e.g., fluorescent particles) and some microbial surrogate were also considered as tracers to investigate the airborne transmission of microorganism [[31], [32], [33], [34], [35], [36], [37]]. DNA barcoded aerosol, as a novel test particle overcoming the effect of test material from pre-existing environmental or background contaminants, was developed to track the fate of the airborne particle in built environment [38,39]. However, airborne microorganism tracing was still a big challenge for its reliability on environment factor, complicated detection, and species-dependence. The decay of airborne microorganism was indispensable factor in both empirical and theoretical models of airborne transmission, which was difficult to be quantified [2,40,41]. Inlet air filter to remove the effect of background concentration was indispensable in the use of tracer bacteria without specificity in UVGI studies [[42], [43], [44]]. Whereas, the lack of biological characteristics for particles or narrow application of microbial surrogate in clean or isolated room prevented it to be an ideal substitution of airborne microorganism. Totally, current tracers of airborne microorganism failed to veritably express the airborne transporting process in atmosphere. Both physical and biological characteristics of bacterial tracer made it a more reasonable substitution of current tracers of airborne microorganism.",

Specific gene strain tracing had already been applied in many food safety-related studies to monitor their fate in complex environment or in laboratory animal medicine to explore the distribution of target bacteria in internal organs [[45], [46]]. However, there was still a knowledge gap of gene-modified bacteria in the trace of airborne microorganism. Aerosolization of bacteria, which was susceptible to the suspending medium and shear stress, was widely performed in lab-experiment such as air sterilization and air infection [[47], [48], [49], [50], [51], [52], [53], [54], [55]]. Aerosolization and gene modification of bacteria could be jointly used for tracing airborne microorganism. The new method which could fulfill the following three conditions was essential to set up for airborne bacteria tracing across built environments.i)The modified gene should be specific to make it distinguished in surrounding environment.ii)Selected bacteria could be genetic-modified as a bacterial tracer.iii)Aerosolization should have little impact on the survival of the bacteria and the stability of the modified gene.\n",

Five specificity tests conducted before each trial indicated no existence of tracer E. coli or pFPV-mCherry fluorescent protein plasmid in field validation of the tracing method between lay hen houses, which could be interpreted by low imported concentration and unsuitability of survival for airborne microorganism. Above 95% stability rate of the introduced plasmid in E. coli DH5\u03b1 proved that the selected bacteria could be genetic-modified as a bacterial tracer. E. coli O157:H7 labeled with green fluorescent protein (GFP) applied for tracking of introduced foodborne pathogens to monitor their fate in complex environments also supported its feasibility [45]. Culturability and cell membrane integrity of bacteria could be affected by aerosolization resulting in free DNA release [[56], [57]], which was agreed with our study.
