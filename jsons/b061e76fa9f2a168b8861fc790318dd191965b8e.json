Introduction The Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread to the world causing a pandemic with more than 2 millions infections and more than 148 thousands deaths world wide (1) on April 19th, 2020. There have been studies for the effects of early control measures taken in China: (2-4) on public health interventions and control strategies on Wuhan's outbreaks; (5) on Wuhan travel ban on the spread of COVID-19 inside China and (6) on both the domestic and international implications of Wuhan travel ban; (7) on the transmissibility and severity in mainland Chinese locations outside Hubei. Three months after Wuhan being sealed off, there are more than 25 countries which have endured at least four weeks of community infections with good amount of epidemic data accrued (8-10).

A reason for our higher R 0 is that the vSEIdR model allows infection prior to clinical diagnosis as reflected by the R t having two terms from equation (S.4) in SM, reflecting the infections made in the Exposed (pre-diagnosis) and Infected (Diagnosed) compartments respectively. Table 1 as their average R t over the four weeks were 1.03 and 1.54, respectively. In contrast, 20 countries had the four week average larger than 2.0, and 10 of them more than 3.0. Not only that the absolute infectiousness of Korea and China were the lowest over the four weeks, their cumulative percentages of declines were the most as shown in Table   S2 . The drastic decline in the reproduction of China echos recent studies on the effectiveness of Chine's control measures (23, 24) . Behind Korea and China's rapid declines in their R t were two similar but not the same strategies. China's measures are largely based on limitation of population movement and contacts by sealing off cities and enforcing high levels of selfisolation at homes (5, 25) , which led to rapid reduction in the contact rates (2, 26) . In addition to limiting population contacts, and a quick blockade of Daegu, Korean conducted more active 5 .

In additional to the significant effects on the average reproduction numbers R t and the time to turning point by taking action to restrict population contacts earlier (Panels (a)-(b) in Comparing to the actual cases observed up to April 10, Figure 2 shows that 1.20 (1.26) millions total reductions in the confirmed cases and 75,105 (79,543) reduction in deaths for the 23 countries under the Korea's (China's) scenario, mounting to 88% and 80% reductions of the confirmed cases and deaths in average, respectively (more details in Table S3 -S5). The reductions in the cases and deaths would be phenomenal for US, UK, Germany, Australia, Japan and France, attaining more than 89% reduction in the confirmed cases and 74% reduction in deaths under Korea's scenario, if control measures were implemented earlier which would lead to the reductions in the infectious rates from Day 8 of community transmission.

Under the Korea's removal rates, the deaths would reduce by 26.7% in average, and for five countries, the US, the UK, Belgium, Sweden and Canada, the deaths would be more than halved, as compared to the predicted casualties under the Natural Designs. In contrast to the deaths, the predicted total infected cases ( Figure   6 ) are less responsive to the designs, especially for countries which have had their R t < 1 on April 19th as the low R t s cushion much of the design differences for the projected final cases. It is also due to the four designs all used the same infection and diagnosis rates. The differences in the numbers of infected cases and deaths between the two Natural Designs are not much for almost all countries, although Design 1 (\u03b3 r,min = 1/17.5) leads to less infections and deaths in general for countries whose recovery rate has not reached 1/17.5 benefited by a shorter infectious period.",

Acting early can hugely impact the infection size and thus lessen demands on medical resources down the track, and eventually improve the removal processes for those infected. The second lesson is to maintain a certain level of the diagnostic rate to speed up the epidemic progression as favorably shown in Korea, and the US and the UK diagnosis-rateexchange experiment.

Epidemic projections under Korea and China's scenarios Given the effectiveness of Korea and China's approaches in containing COVID-19, we generate scenarios for other countries that mimic Korea and China's daily reduction percentages in the infection rates from the 8th day since the start of local transmission, while keeping their diagnosis rate, recovery and death rates intact.

It appears from Figure 4 that sustained declining trend of R t was established after March 13 and March 20 for the US and the UK, respectively. The experimental design of Five-Day Earlier intervention would mean the R t curves start to decline from March 8 for the US and March 15 for the UK at the actual daily declines rates from March 13 and 20, respectively. The Five-Day Delayed experiments is to mimic later actions that would delay the decline in R t from March 13 and 20 for five days to March 18 and 25, respectively. Panels (a)-(b) of Figure 4 display the actual R t curves with the hypothetical ones under the two designs.

Thus, the US would have more time to amplify the effect of the intervention. A less obvious reason for the differential sensitivity lays in the estimated diagnosed rates: 0.17 for the US and 0.1 for the UK, implying the UK having longer time for diagnosing the infected than the US. The larger diagnosis rate for the US means quicker turn-over time from expose to diagnosis, which would bring early peak time for the confirmed infected cases I(t) and reduce the size of infections and hence the death number. Our result shows the numbers of cases and deaths for the US with the UK's diagnosis rate (0.10) would make the US cases amplified by more than 243 % and the deaths by 171% under Five-Day Delay design. For the UK with the US's higher diagnosis rate (0.17), there would be a further 10% reduction in the number of confirmed cases under 5-Day Early design, where the impacts on the death was not significant.
