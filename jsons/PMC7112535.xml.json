Length of hospital stay is the key determinant of cost in patients hospitalised with acute respiratory illness26 and so represents an outcome measure which is both clinically and economically important. For this reason it is often employed as a primary or secondary outcome measure in clinical trials in hospitalised patients. Although affected by factors other than acute illness such as patient age and comorbidity, and variations in practice between different centres, providing these can be adequately controlled for hospital length of stay represents a useful and robust clinical outcome measure. It has been suggested that prolonged hospitalisation (e.g. >5\u20137 days) could be used as a clinical end-point for future trials of influenza antivirals in addition to other rarer clinical events such as ICU admission and death.17 Defining the relationship between viral load and length of hospital stay is therefore of significant interest and importance.",

This was a consistent finding across all clinical groups and all virus subtypes and was maintained when adjusting for age, comorbidity, duration of illness, bacterial co-infection and other potentially confounding factors. Our results support the existing body of evidence suggesting that respiratory viruses may cause severe acute respiratory illness and that the resulting clinical illness is a viral load driven process with clinical outcomes predicted by viral load magnitude, kinetics and persistence. Whilst there is already a substantial body of evidence suggesting a relationship between certain clinical outcomes and viral load for influenza and some other respiratory viruses, this is the first study to demonstrate an association between viral load and hospital length of stay and to show a relationship for multiple clinical groups and across multiple viral subtypes within the same study. Our findings suggest that the detection of a high nasopharyngeal viral load in an adult patient hospitalised with acute respiratory illness could be used clinically to identify patients at high risk of prolonged hospitalisation. Although currently most laboratories test for influenza using real-time PCR and so generate Ct values routinely, these are not generally available to clinicians or used for clinical decision making. This study suggest that these results could be passed on to clinicians and used to inform clinical decision making including the priority use of neuraminidase inhibitors for influenza and antivirals for other viruses when they become available.",

This suggests that in contrast to healthy adults with uncomplicated viral infection (where viral load peaks quickly and declines rapidly) for hospitalised adults with complicated respiratory viral illness, the viral load remains an important determinant of clinical outcome at this later time point and is therefore potentially modifiable with effective antiviral therapy. This is consistent with a number of observational studies of hospitalised adults with influenza showing reduction in viral loads and clinical benefits from neuraminidase inhibitors even when started beyond 48 h of symptom duration.14, 29, 30 Although not explored in this study a high viral load is also suggestive of increased infectiousness and an increased risk of nosocomial spread and so patients with a high viral load detected on admission to hospital would represent a priority group for side room isolation and enhanced infection control practices.",

Although all patients had respiratory swabs taken from the nasopharynx, as is standard clinical practise when testing for respiratory viruses in the UK, this site may be insensitive for the detection of respiratory viruses in some patients with lower respiratory tract infection.34 Some studies have found increased rates of respiratory virus detection from sputum compared to upper respiratory tract samples34, 35 and so it is possible that some of our patients that were excluded due to negative PCR on nasopharyngeal samples may have actually had detectable viruses in their lower respiratory tract. It is also possible that when viruses are detected from both upper and lower respiratory samples that the viral load might be different between the two. We would suggest that the findings of this study are validated in a large prospective cohort incorporating sampling from the upper and lower respiratory tract and examining viral kinetics and persistence over the course of hospitalisation.",

If confirmed in further studies this could be used in clinical practice to identify patients at risk of prolonged hospital stay and to prioritise for antiviral treatment and enhanced infection control practises.",
