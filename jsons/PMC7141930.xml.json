Since the end of February, we have witnessed an overflow of patients, with the real risk of spreading the viral infection. For this reason, at our University Hospital with a catchment area of about 950,000 people, we have decided to elaborate a more articulate pathway for acute stroke patients, before admitting them to our Stroke Unit.",

Conversely, if the ischemic stroke is determined by a large vessel occlusion, the patient is transferred to the Angio suite of the Neuroradiology Unit for endovascular treatment, and the personnel is pre-alerted for adopting adequate PPEs. At the end of the procedure, according to the type of anesthesia (i.e., conscious sedation or general anesthesia), the patient is transferred to the Infectious Disease ward or to a special Intensive Care Unit (ICU) dedicated to COVID-19 patients.

Noteworthy, the results of this test are not rapidly available but take at least one hour. Meanwhile, the patient undergoes cerebral CT, CTA, and CTP on a mobile CT unit positioned just outside the ED. Patients deemed eligible for intravenous thrombolysis follow the standard protocol. If there is no indication for thrombectomy, the patient waits for the result of the COVID-19 screening in a dedicated area, where he is clinically monitored by the stroke team. Only if the COVID-19 screening is negative, the patient is transferred to the Stroke Unit. However, if the COVID-19 screening is positive, the patient is transferred to a dedicated COVID-19 medical ward.

If the COVID-19 screen is negative, the patient is transferred to the Stroke Unit or to the Neuro-ICU according to the type of anesthesia, as reported above. If COVID-19 screen is positive and the procedure has been performed under conscious sedation, the patient is transferred to a special unit of the Infectious Disease ward where he is clinically monitored by the stroke team and by the internist. On the other hand, if thrombectomy is performed under general anesthesia, the patient is transferred to a special ICU dedicated to COVID-19 patients.

Alas, these are patients also at higher stroke risk. Compared with the same period in 2019, we have observed a half of minor strokes, TIAs, and transfers from spokes, along with longer onset-to-door and door-to-treatment times for major strokes. As a result, the number of patients who have undergone intravenous thrombolysis or bridging therapy (combined intravenous and thrombectomy) is decreased (\u2212 26% and \u2212 30% respectively), while the number of primary thrombectomies is increased by 41%: most of these patients had very serious strokes arriving late, sometimes too late.",

There are several advantages with this pathway, namely a protection of our Stroke Unit and personnel from COVID-19 infection, a continuous open access to all possible stroke victims including those coming from spoke hospitals. Finally, in these times of COVID-19 turbulence, this protocol might serve as a safe guide for all caregivers in order not to forget that stroke is a medical emergency and to keep paying a high attention even when symptoms are minor.",
