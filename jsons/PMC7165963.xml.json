            "text": "Porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED), an acute and highly contagious enteric disease only seen in pigs, is caused by Porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV). PEDV, a member of the genus Alphacoronavirus within the family Coronaviridae (Pensaert and de Bouck 1978), is an enveloped, single\u2010stranded, positive\u2010sense RNA virus with a genome of appropriately 28 kb in length (Pensaert and de Bouck 1978). Its genome is sequentially composed of 5' untranslated region (UTR), open reading frame 1a/1b (ORF1a/1b), spike (S), ORF3, envelope (E), membrane (M), nucleocapsid (N) and 3' UTR (Liu et al. \n2017). The clinical signs of PED are characterized by severe watery diarrhea with subsequent dehydration in all ages of swine, and a high mortality rate in suckling piglets (Stevenson et al. \n2013). A case of PED was first reported in Belgium in 1978, and since then the disease has been rapidly spreading to other regions in Europe and Asia (Pensaert and de Bouck 1978; Song and Park 2012). Since 2010, a large number of PED outbreaks have been reported in China, with a mortality rate of 50\u2013100% among infected suckling piglets (Sun et al. \n2016). In 2013, PED spread rapidly to the United States, causing high rates of death among piglets and substantial economic losses to the porcine industry there (Vlasova et al. \n2014).",

            "text": "It has been widely acknowledged that multiple immunizations (the \u2018prime\u2010boost\u2019) are indispensable for a vaccine to be effective. This means that the immunized subjects have to go through several immunizations before ideal efficacy can be expected. Research has proved that in many cases, priming immunizations and boost immunizations (heterologous prime\u2010boost) using different types of vaccines targeting the same antigens, is more immunogenic than using the same types of vaccines (homologous prime\u2010boost) (Lu 2009). The efficacy of the heterologous prime\u2010boost has been further proved by Wang et al. in their study where the combination of a fusion expression plasmid of CTLA4 and (Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus) PRRSV GP5 and inactivated PRRSV vaccines in the \u2018prime\u2010boost\u2019 format are found to be able to induce significant humoral and cellular responses (Wang et al. \n2013). In the study of Pan et al. after sequentially immunized with a haemagglutinin (HA) DNA vaccine and an inactivated avian influenza (AI) vaccine, the Specific\u2010Pathogen Free (SPF) chickens were completely protected after intranasally challenged with H9N2 AIV (Pan et al. \n2009). Furthermore, it has been supported by the study of Wang et al. that the use of HA DNA vaccines as the prime combined with inactivated flu vaccines as the boost is more effective in eliciting protective antibody responses than the use of DNA vaccines or inactivated vaccines alone (Wang et al. \n2008). In addition, several other studies that also used the \u2018heterologous prime\u2010boost\u2019 strategy have demonstrated better enhanced immune responses in the \u2018heterologous prime\u2010boost\u2019 group compared with the use of only one type of vaccines alone (Schneider et al. \n2001; Boyer et al. \n2005; Ranasinghe et al. \n2006), indicating that the heterologous prime\u2010boost is indeed a more effective way of immunization.",

            "text": "In our previous study, we found that coated PEDV\u2010loaded microspheres induced PEDV\u2010specific immunity via oral administration one time in weaned piglets (Wen et al. \n2018). It is not unusual that multiple immunizations (i.e. \u2018prime\u2010boost\u2019) are required for many vaccines to be successful (Lu 2009). To enhance the immune responses against PEDV, we have tried the prime\u2010boost immunization regimen. Pregnant sows were primed with coated PEDV\u2010loaded microspheres and then boosted with coated PEDV\u2010loaded microspheres or inactivated PEDV vaccines. As shown in Fig. 1, we detected higher levels of PEDV\u2010specific IgG in serum samples collected from sows in the \u2018coated PEDV\u2010loaded microspheres + inactivated vaccines\u2019 group at day 35 after the first immunization (P < 0\u00b705), compared to other negative controls (Fig. 1a). Moreover, we also observed higher PEDV\u2010specific IgA titres in milk samples collected from sows in the \u2018coated PEDV\u2010loaded microspheres + inactivated PEDV vaccines\u2019 group (P < 0\u00b7001), compared to other negative groups (Fig. 1b), indicating the prime\u2010boost strategy can enhance humoral responses in pregnant sows. In addition, we also found that the pregnant sows in the group of \u2018coated PEDV\u2010loaded microspheres + inactivated PEDV vaccines\u2019 are with significantly higher levels of antibodies compared with the pregnant sows boost immunized with coated PEDV\u2010loaded microspheres, indicating that the heterologous prime\u2010boost immunization can be more immunogenic than the homologous prime\u2010boost. This result is supported by other similar studies (Wang et al. \n2008; Pan et al. \n2009). Virus neutralizing antibodies are very important for the protective immunity against PEDV, as it can inhibit PEDV replication in intestinal epithelial cells by blocking PEDV attachment and internalization in the cells (Li et al. \n2017). Considering that neutralizing antibodies play pivotal roles in protecting neonates from enteric infections, we tested whether serum and milk samples collected from the sows in different vaccines groups can inhibit PEDV infection in target cells by detecting the number of neutralizing antibodies in these serum and milk samples. As shown in Fig. 2, sera collected from sows immunized by coated PEDV\u2010loaded microspheres + inactivated PEDV vaccines have higher neutralizing antibody titres than the sera collected from sows in other negative groups (P < 0\u00b705 or P < 0\u00b701) (Fig. 2a). Similarly, milk samples collected from the sows after their delivery also have higher neutralizing antibody titers in the \u2018coated PEDV\u2010loaded microspheres + inactivated PEDV vaccines\u2019 group (P < 0\u00b705), compared to other negative groups (Fig. 2b). Our data show that the titres of neutralizing antibodies in the serum and milk of the sows were significantly increased after they were immunized with inactivated PEDV vaccines. In addition, we found that all the inoculated sows and those in the control group did not show any clinical problems (data not shown), proving that the coated PEDV\u2010loaded microspheres are safe for sows.",

In this study, all the suckling piglets delivered by the sows were challenged with PEDV via oral feeding, and we found that suckling piglets from the \u2018coated PEDV\u2010loaded microspheres + inactivated PEDV vaccines\u2019 group had the highest protection rate (91\u00b72%) (Fig. 3) after the PEDV challenge without any clinical problem displayed, indicating that the heterologous prime\u2010boost immunization can most efficiently induce lactogenic immunity and protect suckling piglets against PEDV infection. However, there are still several important questions that need to be addressed. For example, what is the protective mechanism of the heterologous prime\u2010boost immunization? Can the protection rate in neonatal suckling piglets be increased by vaccines combine with adjuvants? Does the vaccination provide cross\u2010protection against other PEDV strains? The further elucidation of these questions will help us better control PED.",
