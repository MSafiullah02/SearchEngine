Patients with influenza infections had significantly elevated values (np5, median 750), and interferon could be detected only in serum samples from influenza patients. In conclusion, expression of MxA in blood lymphocytes and an apparently systemic type I interferon response is not induced during rhinovirus infection or during most other cases of common cold in young adult patients.",

The median age of the patients was 23.9 years (range 19.4-37.1 years). Diagnosis of viral infection was performed as described previously [9] . Briefly, antigen detection or culture from nasopharyngeal aspirate and serological tests were used for detection of adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, influenza viruses A and B and parainfluenza virus types 1, 2 and 3. Rhinoviruses were detected both by culture and by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Based on the viral diagnosis, the patients were divided into three groups. There were 15 rhinovirus-positive subjects (8 culture positive, 7 of whom were also PCR positive; Serum type I IFN levels were also analyzed by two different assays as described below. Since we were not able to detect elevated MxA levels in the rhinovirus-positive patients in the first phase of the study, we wanted to study whether these patients would have type I interferon in serum. For this purpose, two assays were used as described below. There was no serum left of the influenza virus-positive patients analyzed in the MxA assay, and, therefore, the serum specimens from influenza virus-positive patients whose lymphocytes were used for MxA expression analysis were not available. Therefore, in our analysis, we used 15 paired serum samples from patients with a marked rise in serum antibodies against influenza A. These frozen serum samples were obtained from a collection of serum samples stored at the Department of Virology, University of Turku (J.I.).",

In all groups the induced values were significantly higher than the baseline values (Table 1) . IFN-a/b levels were measured in serum, since MxA expression is regulated by type I IFNs. None of the patients with rhinovirus infection had detectable IFN-a/b in serum as measured by either enzyme immunoassay or by a biological assay. A similar observation was made in the rhinovirus-negative patients and in the control group. IFN-a/b was detectable in the serum of seven of the 15 . In six of the seven patients, IFN was detected in the acute-phase serum but not in the convalescent serum, and in one patient, IFN was detected only in the convalescent serum sample.",

Moreover, rhinovirus has been shown to induce IFN in vitro [11] , and IFN has been found in the nasal secretions of volunteers infected with rhinovirus [12] . Stimulation with exogenous IFN-a, on the other hand, resulted in significant induction, suggesting that there is no functional defect associated with the rhinovirus infection per se. It is known that viruses and, probably, virus strains differ in their ability to induce IFN production, and there is also significant individual variation [11] . IFN synthesis is often short-lived, but MxA is a stable protein with a half-life of several days [6] . Since all patients were examined within 48 h after the onset of symptoms, it is unlikely that potential MxA upregulation would have been missed due to delayed analysis [7, 13] .",

The numbers inside the boxes indicate the number of samples etiology could not be identified. One patient included in the rhinovirus group also had a rise in antibodies against the Coronavirus 229 E. The influenza group consisted of three patients with influenza virus A infection and two with influenza virus B infection (np5). The control group consisted of 11 healthy adults.",
