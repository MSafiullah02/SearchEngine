According to the DSM-V criteria, the main characteristic of specific phobias is fear or anxiety limited by the phobia source. If the individual occasionally feels anxious when encountering a particular object or situation, s/he is not to be diagnosed with specific phobia. The response must be different from the usual and temporary fears that are common in society. At the same time, the level of fear or anxiety must be intense. The level of fear may vary depending on the proximity to the object or the situation. However, individuals do not have to show an extreme and meaningless anxiety response in order to be diagnosed with specific phobia. Considering the situation and the environment, the individual's \u201cdisproportionate\u201d fear and anxiety response is sufficient for diagnosis (APA, 2013). Specific phobias can trigger other anxiety disorders and are reported to comorbid with suicidal tendency, major depression, anxiety disorders, and physical, mental, or mood disorders (Aus\u00edn, Mu\u00f1oz, Castellanos, & Garc\u00eda, 2020; Corchs et al., 2006; Keyes, Deale, Foster, & Veale, 2020; Witthauer et al., 2016).",

People develop disproportional cognitive, affective, or behavioral responses to the objects and situations that they associate with the COVID-19 pandemic and severe deteriorations may occur in the physiological and psychological functionalities.

On the other hand, it is often noted in anecdotal experiences that people are afraid of being infected with COVID-19. Previous studies show that natural disasters such as an earthquake or a tsunami; man-made catastrophes such as explosions, wars or terrorism; or epidemics such as MERS, SARS or Ebola lead to detrimental emotions such as phobia, anxiety, depression, hopelessness, and hostility in the short and long terms (Colorado, 2017; Hossain, Sultana, & Purohit, 2020; Qi, Yang, Tan, Wu, & Zhou, 2020; Steinberg & Daniel, 2020). Therefore, as expected, people have already started experiencing phobic reactions in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. As the pandemic spreads quickly, COVID-19 is expected to lead to increased psycho-pathological problems due to the potential for easy transmission, lack of treatment, and the higher levels of the virus-related deaths (Duan & Zhu, 2020; Gao et al., 2020; Rothan & Byrareddy, 2020).",

These negative effects are causing conditions including stress, depression, psycho-somatic, and psycho-social disorders. It is important to detect early sings of COVID-19 phobia in order to provide timely psychological support for individuals who display higher levels of it (Duan & Zhu, 2020; Qiu et al., 2020). However, because it is a relatively novel problem, no psychometrically sound assessment is found in the literature to assess the levels of phobia on COVID-19. The American Psychiatric Association (APA) recommends the development of assessment tools adapted to DSM-V criteria for specific phobia disorders. Therefore, the current study aimed to develop a COVID-19 phobia scale (i.e., C19P-S), whose items correspond to the specific phobia (300.29, formerly known as simple phobia) diagnosis criteria of the DSM-V and whose psychometric properties are empirically supported. The C19P-S aims to both contribute to research and enrich future studies on coronavirus.",

First, even though the samples were heterogonous, we assume that subjects in both samples mostly non-diagnosed individuals in terms of any phobia. These measurements should also be tested with clinically diagnosed phobic cases that show the symptoms of clinical phobia. The instrument is named \u201ccorona phobia scale\u201d and appropriately, its items should be further tested with clinical diagnostics information which may evidence the diagnostic accuracy of the items for classifying cases as clinically phobic. Finally, the base-rate of infected cases (14/2147 = 0.65%) did not allow us to conduct any method of classification analysis (i.e., a logistic regression or CART analysis). Future studies should replicate the results with culturally more diverse populations as well as clinically diagnosed patients. Classification analysis should be conducted to evidence classification power of the C19P-S.",
