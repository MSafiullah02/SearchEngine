Estimates suggest that, for SARS-CoV-2, R0 is >2.4 [3] [4] [5] ; thus for every case which occurs, on average more than two additional cases are generated in a susceptible population, in the absence of adequate measures such as isolation.

The majority of descriptive papers investigating mild symptoms are focused on inpatients [7] , specific populations [8] or modelling [9] . Although there are suggestions of lower infectivity amongst asymptomatic patients [9] , this has not been confirmed. Estimates for the proportion of asymptomatic patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 in different populations range between 7 and 80% [10] [11] [12] , with a substantial proportion of transmission occurring prior to illness onset [13, 14] .",

Regularly updated recommendations have been issued to reduce patient contact and adjust patient flow for ophthalmology during the pandemic [16] . Gloves, disposable aprons, eye protection, fluid resistant type IIR surgical masks and slit lamp guards are recommended as personal protective equipment (PPE) for ophthalmic clinic assessment by the Royal College of Ophthalmologists [17] . In addition, the optimal type of respiratory protective masks remains a matter of important debate and varies. Within Europe, filtering face piece (FFP) respirator masks are graded based on filter efficacy and face adhesion: FFP 1-3 are able to filter with efficacies of 80%, 94% and 99% respectively [14, 18] . Within the USA, FFP2 masks are termed N95. Guidelines for mask use vary worldwide. The European Centre for Disease and Prevention and the US CDC [19] recommend FFP2 masks (N95) for care of patients with COVID-19, whilst the WHO recommends standard surgical masks [20] . Within the UK, Public Health England regularly update their guidance with regard to PPE [21] .",

SARS-CoV-2 likely binds in the first instance to nasal epithelial cells before migrating through the bronchial tree where it preferentially infects alveolar type II lung cells leading to a viral laden mucus that passes up the respiratory tract [22] . Transmission can occur through droplets and viral laden aerosols generated from breathing, coughing and sneezing and, in the healthcare environment, from procedures known as aerosol generating procedures. Large droplets are propelled through the air and can cause infection through a contact mechanism with or without fomites [12, 23] . Small droplets may evaporate to create an aerosol; defined as small particles (<10 \u03bcm diameter) in suspension in gas [24] . Aerosols can remain suspended in the air for long periods, with the potential of travelling large distances (metres) transmitting disease by being inhaled and penetrating deeply into the respiratory tract. Symptomatic patients with SARS tend to develop lower respiratory tract infections, suggesting aerosol transmission is important [25] . Numerous studies have demonstrated the presence of influenza virus in exhaled breath [26, 27] . SARS-CoV-2 has been demonstrated in tears [28] , and causes ocular signs in patients with COVID-19 [29] , although infrequently. Therefore, there is a potential for ocular mucosal transmission, though this is likely to be much less than via the respiratory mucosa. Viral presence in intraocular contents is unknown.",

Mask use in the context of AGP is more stringent. To try to avoid inhalation of small viral laden particles in the air requires a tight seal around the edge of the mask and greater filtering capacity. However, the exact requirements mandated vary throughout the world.

The frequency of modern phacoemulsification handpieces exceeds 40 kHz and modern pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) handpieces have cut rates in excess of 5000 cuts/min. These can therefore certainly be considered \"high speed\" surgical devices. In addition, it is possible that other vitreoretinal surgical manoeuvres could generate droplets or aerosol, such as fluid-air exchange. During the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, it is likely that PPV for rhegmatogenous retinal detachment will be the most commonly performed intraocular surgery. The length of surgery in close proximity to patient airways poses further risk. To minimise risk of transmission, we as the Royal College of Ophthalmologists and the British and Eire Association of Vitreoretinal Surgeons have issued specific guidelines regarding these procedures [17] . These include reducing surgical volume, minimising staff presence and potential use of additional surgical drapes to minimise aerosol transmission. In particular, despite the absence of complete evidence at present, but based on the balance of risk and probability, we consider PPV should be treated as an AGP. We therefore advise appropriate PPE including FFP3 masks for surgeon and nurses during these procedures. Given the asymptomatic burden of SARS-Cov-2, we have recommended these precautions should be applied regardless of patients' symptoms [17] . We are pleased to note that the American Society of Retinal Specialists has more recently made similar recommendations [36] embodying a wider consensus. Recommendations will continue to adapt, reflecting the impact of social measures, new scientific evidence, more reliable viral testing and population healthcare needs.",
