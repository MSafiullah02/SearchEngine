CPV-2 is a common etiological agent that causes severe gastroenteritis in puppies. The virus has a high detection rate in clinical samples, and the most characteristic signs of this illness are diarrhea, emesis, and anorexia (Apaa et al., 2016). Multiple studies have confirmed that CPV-2 coinfects with more than one enteric pathogen, including Canine enteric coronavirus, Canine circovirus (CanineCV), and Canine distemper virus (Costa et al., 2014; Kotsias et al., 2019; Navarro et al., 2017). T. Thaiwong hypothesizes that the CPV-2 infection predisposes dogs to CanineCV infection and ultimately results in more severe disease (Thaiwong et al., 2016).",

            "text": "Porcine circovirus (PCV) is the smallest autonomously replicating virus with a genome length of 1.7 kb (Cao et al., 2018; Lv et al., 2014). The PCV genome contains two major open reading frames (ORFs). ORF1 encodes the replication-associated protein (Rep), which plays an important role in virus replication (Lekcharoensuk et al., 2004; Walia et al., 2014). ORF2 encodes the sole structural protein (capsid protein, Cap), which contains immunologically important epitopes associated with the virus neutralization (Cheung, 2012). Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) infection causes a diverse range of diseases resulting in substantial economic loses to the porcine industry (Segales et al., 2005). It is worth noting that PCV2 could transmit to nonporcine hosts through cross-species transmission routes. Specifically, cattle, dogs and sheep can be infected with PCV2 (Li et al., 2011; Song et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2018; Zhai et al., 2017). Recently, a novel and genetically divergent circovirus, PCV3, was found in swine with PDNS, PMWS in the United States (Palinski et al., 2017). Subsequently, this virus has been detected in many countries and has an abnormally high positive rate (Costa et al., 2014; Deim et al., 2019; Faccini et al., 2017; Saraiva et al., 2019). In China, multiple epidemiological surveillance data indicated that this virus was extensively prevalent in pigs in many provinces and specific cities (Qi et al., 2019; Sun et al., 2018). Multiple studies have revealed that the virus was associated with several diseases (such as PDNS, multisystemic inflammation, reproductive failure) and coinfects with other viruses (for example, Torque teno sus virus, PCV2, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus) (Chen et al., 2019; Ha et al., 2018; Wen et al., 2018). Retrospective survey studies indicated that PCV3 infection could be traced back to 1996 (Sun et al., 2018). Recent studies confirmed that a PDNS-like disease is reproduced with PCV3 infection alone, and further research suggested that PCV3 is more pathogenic for piglets than PCV2 (Jiang et al., 2019).",

Surprisingly, recent studies indicated that dogs could be infected with PCV3 (Zhang et al., 2018). Our previous research also indicated that cattle could be infected with PCV3 (Wang et al., 2019). These results indicates that PCV3 is similar to PCV2 and could transmit to nonporcine hosts, possibly through cross-species transmission routes. However, knowledge about the infection rate and pathogenicity of this virus in dogs is limited.

Consistent with previous reports, there are six variant sequences of amino acids 24 to 27 of the Cap (Sun et al., 2018). Several studies suggest that these four amino acids are associated with genetic variation and evolution of PCV3 (Ha et al., 2018; Qi et al., 2019).

In the present study, the dog-origin PCV3 strain in this study share hight nucleic acid similarity (>95%) with reference sequences of pig-origin PCV3. In addition, compared with pig-origin PCV3 strain, there was no significant amino acid mutation in dog-origin PCV3 strain. Above all, the results of this study indicate that the high genetic stability of dog-origin PCV3. Surprisingly, we separately analyzed these PCV3 strains from the Guangxi Province and found that the dog and pig PCV3 are from different branches. Opriessnig proved that PCV2 in muscle and bone marrow was infectious and transmissible to pigs through the oral route (Opriessnig et al., 2007). The result indicated that PCV3 could transmit to nonporcine hosts by cross-species transmission routes. However, no evidence to prove that PCV3 in muscle and blood of pig was infectious and transmissible to dogs through the oral route. One guess is that PCV3 has been lurking in dogs for a long time.",
