In total, seven patients (7/101, 7%) developed symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection during the postoperative period, of whom three male patients (3/101, 3%) were diagnosed with symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection. All three SARS-CoV-2-positive patients developed significant postoperative pulmonary complications (Supplementary Fig. 1) and one patient died. The remaining four patients were subsequently diagnosed with pyelonephritis (the safety of surgical procedures in SARS-CoV-2 hospitals are important so that knowledge can be provided to surgeons on perioperative SARS-CoV-2-related outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic. At present, various guidelines and opinions on preoperative SARS-CoV-2 screening protocols are available (eg, thorax computed tomography vs nasopharyngeal swab). However, such guidelines are limited by their level of evidence as, todate, they are based on expert opinion without robust prospective data[4]. Our current departmental policy is to perform a screening telephone interview 7 d before surgery and to advise elective patients with asymptomatic COVID-19 to self-isolate. A second screening telephone interview in conjunction with a nasopharyngeal swab is carried out 24-48 h before all elective surgery cases.Our short-term findings demonstrate that the incidence and mortality rate of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection is approximately 3% and 1%, respectively, among patients undergoing urological surgery during the pandemic. Diagnosis of postoperative SARS-CoV-2 infection is difficult, as symptoms mimic common postoperative surgical complications (eg, atelectasis). Patients who experience postoperative COVID-19 are likely to develop significant respiratory complications and have a prolonged inpatient admission. Information from this study will enable surgeons to balance the risk of delaying urgent surgical procedures against the increased morbidity and mortality associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection.",
