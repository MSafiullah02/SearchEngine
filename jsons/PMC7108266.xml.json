            "text": "On September 20, 2012, the first confirmed case of a new severe respiratory syndrome caused by a novel coronavirus was reported [1], [2]. The patient was a previously healthy male, 60 years old, who lived in Saudi Arabia and died of acute respiratory illness and renal failure [1]. Retrospective analysis of stored samples revealed that the novel coronavirus was also the cause of a severe respiratory disease cluster involving patients and health care professionals in Jordan earlier that year [3]. The isolation of the new virus from the Saudi patient's specimen, and subsequent sequencing and detailed phylogenetic analysis of the virus genome has revealed its close relationship with bat beta-coronaviruses previously found in Asia, Europe and Africa [1], [4], [5], [6], [7]. Whether this emerging hCoV jumped from bats directly to humans or through other animals as intermediate hosts is still unknown, although the latter scenario is considered to be most likely [2]. The presence of MERS-CoV neutralising antibodies has been detected in dromedary camels in Spain, Oman and Egypt indicating a past infection with MERS-CoV or a highly related virus in these camelids [8], [9]. The evolutionary history of coronaviruses shows evidence of recent interspecies jumps [10], [11]. One of the first described human coronaviruses, OC43, shares a common recent ancestral history with bovine coronaviruses, suggesting these viruses may have emerged from animals as well [10]. In 2003, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) emerged and was the first known major outbreak caused by a coronavirus [12]. Now, the emergence of MERS-CoV, and its high fatality rate has triggered new concerns about the potential for a widespread, possibly global outbreak. Challenges for public health are to develop strategies to control this emerging disease, which include early detection of cases for with laboratory diagnosis is of crucial importance.",

Laboratory response during the early stages of an outbreak therefore focuses on development of virological/microbiological and immunological methods for patient diagnosis, for contact tracing, and for epidemiological studies into sources, modes of transmission, identification of risk groups, screening of potential animal reservoirs, etc. However, optimal use of this core laboratory capacity requires embedding of data needs for laboratory scientists within the outbreak investigations, in order to obtain information needed for assay validation and correct interpretation of test outcomes.",

Here, we review the current knowledge on MERS-CoV and other human coronaviruses against data required for optimal laboratory response for the MERS-CoV.",

            "text": "Nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA) are the most common respiratory specimens described in the literature for molecular diagnosis of non-SARS and SARS coronaviruses [17], [18], [19]. Comparison of data between studies is difficult because specimen sampling is not standardised, with descriptions varying from naso-pharyngeal swab, naso-pharyngeal secretion, throat swab, nasal swab, oro-nasal swab, all reflecting \u201cupper respiratory tract\u201d sampling. Literature review shows that hCoV viral loads peak at different time points during the progression of disease: for non-SARS CoV (e.g. hCoV-NL63), peak viral loads are detected around day 1\u20132 after onset of disease, with apparent clearance of infection, over the course of 3 weeks in 50% of healthy children [17], [20], [21]. For SARS-CoV, viral loads gradually increase until day 10 (60\u201395% of patients) after the onset of symptoms, and then progressively decrease after day 13 (42\u201390% of patients) [22], [23], [24] (Fig. 1\n). This comparison illustrates that even for viruses belonging to the same family, using a sensitive test (like RT-PCR), the interpretation of a test outcome may be very different: a negative reverse-transcriptase (RT)-PCR in a patient specimen collected early after illness onset for hCoV-NL63 may be used as evidence for ruling out infection. The same assay applied in an early specimen from a patient or contact with recent illness onset after SARS-CoV infection would most likely be false-negative, as viral loads are expected to be low during this phase of illness.",

All the MERS-CoV cases reportedly have developed a respiratory disease, ranging from mild to severe pneumonia, often accompanied by acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and/or renal failure and/or pericarditis and/or disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Clinical manifestations and severity of MERS seem to be more similar to SARS than other coronavirus infections. However, only one published report has provided data needed for laboratory preparedness, i.e. on sequential sampling, Ct values, and positive AND negative test results [25]. Therefore, at present, viral shedding kinetics can only indirectly be derived (Fig. 2A and B). We plotted a timeline of available data on sampling and test outcome by day of onset symptoms for the MERS-CoV patients diagnosed in UK, Germany, and France, as well as some cases from Saudi Arabia. The data suggests that shedding kinetics may be more similar to what has been observed for SARS than for other human coronaviruses, although very limited information is available for the latter (Fig. 1, Fig. 2). The review also suggests that the use of upper respiratory specimens for MERS-CoV (e.g. naso-pharyngeal swabs) diagnosis may not be as sensitive as the use of lower respiratory tract specimens (Fig. 2A and B). In agreement with this, viral loads were higher in samples obtained from the lower respiratory tract compared with upper respiratory tract in some MERS-CoV cases [25], [26].",

Sofar, the majority of reported MERS cases have had underlying disease and/or immunosuppression that could be an explanation for the higher case fatality rate (60%) [27], [34], [35]. In addition, delayed clearance of viral infection in such risk groups could be an alternative explanation for the prolonged shedding observed in the patients described (Fig. 2B). Patients with co-morbidities more often have non-SARS CoV infections (hCoV-229E, hCoV-OC43, hCoV-NL63; hCoV-HKU1) compared with otherwise healthy patients, and may shed virus for prolonged periods of time [36], [37], [38], [39]. In SARS, the clinical course among patients less than 12 years of age was milder and less aggressive when compared with adults and teenagers [40], [41]. Kinetics of viral loads and the pattern of shedding can differ in these groups of patients and influence interpretation of diagnostic results.",

Similarly, IgM antibody levels increased up to 1 month and then declined gradually. This profile has been observed with two different serological assays, assuring that the detection levels of antibodies were not affected by sensitivity of the test. Other studies found specific antibodies (IgG, IgM and IgA) as early as 4 days after the onset of disease [45], [46]. IgG and neutralising antibodies may persist in some patients up to 36 months, although titres showed significant decline after four months [47].

            "text": "For MERS-CoV, some asymptomatic infections have recently been identified in health workers and children (n\n = 8) but whether these persons can efficiently transmit infection remains unknown [50], [51]. Antibody detection assays have been developed, but their use has been limited. A retrospective study has reported serological testing by immunofluorescence assay of 2400 serum samples from persons seeking medical care at Fakeeh Hospital in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia (where the first case of MERS was diagnosed) in the two previous years [1]. All these patients tested negative for MERS-CoV, whereas a patient with confirmed MERS-CoV infection had a clear antibody response for IgG [1]. Some authors have explained their lack of use of serology by the fact that assays are not yet validated [34]. This argument seems flawed, as the same could be argued for PCR assays that are used universally, with the limitations described above. Serological testing confirmed infection in two MERS-CoV patients (from Abu Dhabi and Qatar), hospitalized in Germany. Both had high titres of antibodies by IFA, that were also confirmed by neutralisation tests and by micro-array testing [16], [25], [30]. Interpretation of MERS-CoV serology can be hampered by the widespread circulation of the four common hCoVs, especially by hCoV-OC43 and hCoV-HKU1 which belong to the same genus of the betacoronaviruses. Cross-reactive antibodies have been shown between SARS-CoV and other coronavirus, depending also on specificity of the assay [52], [53].",

A single positive rRT-PCR without confirmation will be considered as inconclusive MERS-CoV laboratory test, and such cases are classified as probable. Several molecular assays are now in widespread use and a two-step approach of screening and confirmation (Table 1) algorithms have been recommended by WHO and CDC [55], [56], [57]. In both algorithms a screening PCR targeting a region upstream of the E gene is proposed, sometimes combined with nucleocapsid (N) gene based PCR, to enhance sensitivity for specimen screening [55], [56], [57]. For confirmation, a second assay with a different set of primers and probes is recommended (Table 1).",

However, the lack of sufficiently detailed data accompanying patient notifications and publications is an important constraint for developing evidence-based diagnostic support to outbreak investigations. To gain a better understanding of the clinical significance and epidemiology of MERS-CoV, it is imperative to collect detailed data on sampling, laboratory analyses and results, combined with clinical and epidemiological data, in order to improve the quality of the laboratory support during outbreaks. Until full validation of laboratory assays has been done, the combined use of molecular and serological approaches is highly recommended. Acute and convalescent serum samples should be collected from each patient to help define kinetics of seroconversion that will help to confirm or rule out infection in future patients, avoid misdiagnosis (false negative test results) due low sensitivity in an early phase of infection when antibody levels are low, and to control for non-specific reactivity.",
