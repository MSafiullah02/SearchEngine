Although this advancement has been driven largely by the introduction of handheld global positioning systems (GPS), and more recently, smartphones and tablet computers with built-in GPS that facilitate geo-tagged data collection, it also highlights the increased awareness of the importance of the spatial aspect when developing efficacious animal disease surveillance and control strategies (Table 1\n). Unfortunately, as a result of the particular challenges currently facing health workers and researchers, for spatial disease data to be able to effectively inform innovative surveillance and disease control strategies, it needs to move beyond the fundamentals of collecting georeferenced disease event data in individual studies and instead focus on an inclusive approach that Eysenbach (2001), in his definition of eHealth, referred to as \u2018a state-of-mind, a way of thinking, an attitude, and a commitment for networked, global thinking, to improve health care locally, regionally, and worldwide by using information and communication technology\u2019.\n",

            "text": "In addition to this collective approach, for spatial disease data to be effective in the 21st century, it needs to meet certain requirements. Firstly, the increasing number of transboundary disease epidemics has emphasized the need for animal and human health information systems that are no longer circumscribed by regional or national borders; transparent collection and sharing of disease data needs to occur at a global scale. Secondly globalization has substantially increased the speed and magnitude of disease spread. In the 2001 UK foot and mouth disease (FMD) outbreak it was estimated that at least 57 premises from 16 counties were infected before the first case was reported (Gibbens and Wilesmith, 2002) while in 2007, equine influenza spread rapidly throughout two Australian states as a result of infected horses attending an equestrian event (Cowled et al., 2009); approximately 70,000 horses on over 9000 premises were infected with most of the geographic dissemination occurring within the first ten days of the epidemic. For containment to be effective, reporting of disease events needs to be as rapid as possible. This is of particular concern in developing countries where reporting of animal disease events can be delayed by months (Karimuribo et al., 2012) while lag times for such reports as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) US Influenza Sentinel Provider Surveillance reports are currently in the order of 1\u20132 weeks (Ginsberg et al., 2009).",

Not surprisingly, the focus so far has been on human health, driven to some extent by US President Barack Obama\u2019s Global Health Initiative (Initiative GH, 2009) and the World Health Organisation\u2019s (WHO) concerted efforts regarding neglected tropical diseases (Cringoli et al., 2013, Global, 2015, Brooker and Utzinger, 2007, van Lieshout and Yazdanbakhsh, 2013, Malone and Bergquist, 2012, Brooker and Smith, 2013, King et al., 2013, Brooker et al., 2006). Also, by their very nature, citizen and internet-based health approaches lend themselves to human rather than animal-health problems and similarly, to developed countries that have the necessary internet infrastructure, rather than developing nations. As a result, internet-based animal-health initiatives currently lag behind those of human health, yet it is to these initiatives that we must look to see how such systems can be best adapted for use in animal health and in developing nations; countries that carry the highest burden of emerging and zoonotic infectious diseases in the world yet frequently have the least capacity for cost-effective risk-led decision making.",

            "text": "Although animal disease surveillance has traditionally been implemented at national and sub-national levels, the increasing number of transboundary animal disease epidemics has highlighted the need for establishing such systems at broader scales. As a result, data warehouses and disease reporting systems such as World Animal Health Information Database (WAHID) (Jebara et al., 2012) and EMPRES Global Animal Disease Information System (EMPRES-i) (FAO: EMPRES transboundary animal disease bulletin, 2011, Farnsworth et al., 2010, Martin et al., 2007) were launched to encourage and facilitate data collection and sharing at a global level (Table 2\n). However, in addition to their original role, such data warehouses also provide researchers with cost-effective access to regularly updated spatial disease data, potentially leading to increased knowledge gains, without the need for costly and time-consuming primary research. Moreover, integration of databases from different sources offers researchers a more extensive and comprehensive collection of information than if individual data sources were used with the possibility of better understanding issues at the population level. However, researchers using this data need to remember that although the provenance of national disease surveillance data ensures that specificity is reasonably high, sensitivity is likely to be low and undoubtedly exhibits considerable spatio-temporal heterogeneity with respect to bias and sensitivity (Perez et al., 2011). Users should also bear in mind the limitations of using data that have generally been spatially referenced to administrative centroids rather than exact outbreak locations; in addition to the possibility of ecological fallacy, Stevens et al. (2013) showed that using outbreak data georeferenced to administrative centroids for spatial modelling purposes can be problematic when either constraining the study area or working at relatively low spatial resolutions.",

However, the difficulties associated with standardizing and combining a range of data sources \u2013 each involving potentially dissimilar unique identifiers, data structures, languages and semantics \u2013 limits the development of animal health geodata warehouses and results in bias. Data adapters (applications that convert attributes of one database into attributes compatible with another database) are integral to the creation of such information systems as they can be used to relate diverse databases through the identification of fields containing equivalent information (Perez et al., 2011).",

In such countries data is generally still collected via paper-based forms despite associated inefficiencies such as data entry errors and long delays before the processed data is available to decision makers (Anokwa et al., 2009). In fact, a survey of selected human and animal health surveillance systems in different regions of Southern Africa found obvious spatial heterogeneity in the delivery of monthly animal health reports to the central epidemiological department; wards closer to the headquarters submitted reports more regularly than those further away while delivery of all reports could be delayed by as much as six to nine months (Karimuribo et al., 2012).",

Similarly, the use of drop-down menus reduces the risk of data entry error (Jandee et al., 2014). Moreover, time spent completing smartphone-based questionnaire surveys is significantly less than when completing paper-based surveys (King et al., 2013, Anokwa et al., 2009, Jandee et al., 2014). However, as availability of open-source mobile software and tools increases \u2013 all differing with respect to accessibility, visualization and cost \u2013 choosing the most appropriate data-collection tool will depend largely on the type of data being collected (Madder et al., 2012).",

However, practical applications of mobile device use in animal disease control and surveillance in developing countries have been described (Robertson et al., 2010, Jean-Richard et al., 2014, Thinyane et al., 2010, Mtema, 2013) and include enhanced reporting of human rabies exposures at bite treatment centres in Tanzania where mobile phone technologies allowed for rapid communication between human and animal health sectors to ensure follow up of animal cases (Mtema, 2013) and the collection of demographic data and movement tracking of mobile pastoralists and their herds in Chad (Jean-Richard et al., 2014). The real-time knowledge on camp location and populations provided by such a study facilitates health interventions, such as vaccination delivery to both humans and animals, highlighting the potential to develop One Health mHealth approaches.

In informal settlements or rural areas in developing countries, the lack of geolocation infrastructure such as road names or house numbers precludes the use of conventional mapping software for visualising disease data. In such instances, Google Earth\u2122 has proven invaluable; in a modern day reprise of John Snow\u2019s 1856 cholera investigation, use of the digital platform allowed Baker et al. (2011) to map the spread of a typhoid outbreak in Kathmandu \u2013 where street names are not used - and trace the cause of the epidemic to low-lying public water resources. Similarly, Wang et al. (2013) used the digital platform to highlight apparent clustering of malaria cases in rural China; information that proved useful in the targeted allocation of limited resources.",

In this way, human health assessment programs have effectively created sampling strategies and collected data on dengue fever (Chang et al., 2009), schistosomiasis (Kun et al., 2012) and human mortality (Galway et al., 2012) in areas with limited or no geolocation infrastructure. For example, to evaluate how proximity to a hospital influenced water quality perceptions and practices in Haiti, Wampler et al. (2013) combined Google Earth\u2122 and the geographic information system software ArcGIS to generate a random sample of households stratified by distance to the hospital. Using a satellite image from EarthExplorer as a basemap in ArcGIS, concentric 1 km buffer zones were created around the hospital. The buffer polygons were then exported to Google Earth\u2122 where the high-resolution imagery allowed individual households within each polygon to be accurately identified and mapped using Google Earth\u2122 pushpins. These point locations were imported into ArcMap where latitude and longitude were added to the dataset and later uploaded into a handheld GPS which was used to locate the households in the field for conducting field surveys (Wampler et al., 2013).",

To extend the usefulness of RS data for providing risk fact information, image processing software such as ImageJ, can be used to analyse the RS images. For example, to identify suitable refuges for mosquitoes during hot, dry conditions, ImageJ was used to analyse Google Earth\u2122 satellite imagery and the number of plants, total amount of vegetation around a homestead and its percentage of the total area were calculated and related to households that had reported cases of malaria. In this way, ImageJ was used to analyse freely-available Google Earth\u2122 images of malaria-endemic locations to identify potential risk factors associated with vegetation cover (Ricotta et al., 2014).",

This is an excellent example of \u2018collective intelligence\u2019 (Spielman, 2014), the premise being that, under the right circumstances, collections of individuals are smarter than even the smartest individuals in the group. Similarly, if the collectively generated end-product is better than the best individual contribution, then the aggregated is incredibly valuable (Spielman, 2014); one of the reasons why the most successful mapping projects often address a pressing need (e.g. Haiti post-earthquake or Ebola outbreak in Guinea) or concentrate on areas with poor geographic coverage (e.g. slums) (Spielman, 2014).",

The question of VGI accuracy extends beyond that of disaster situations and is particularly important when deciding whether citizen scientists can provide information that is of high enough quality to be used in formal scientific investigations. See et al. (2013) found that when using satellite imagery to describe land cover and human impact on the Geo-Wiki website, although there was little difference between expert and non-expert responses when categorising degree of human impact, experts were better than non-experts at identifying a range of land-cover types (See et al., 2013). However, accuracy of VGI can be improved by providing targeted training materials for volunteers (e.g. providing volunteers with pre-disaster imagery against which to compare current images (Zastrow, 2014), guidance on what features to look for (Zastrow, 2014, See et al., 2013) and instituting a continual learning process by providing volunteers with feedback on their contributions (See et al., 2013).",

Given that crowd sourced data are of varying quality, when aggregating such data one has to guard against regression to the mean. That is, a few highly accurate or highly credible contributions should not be degraded by being combined with many contributions of low quality, even if these exceptional contributions are outliers (Spielman, 2014). This is aggravated by the fact that participation in internet-based mapping systems is highly skewed with a few contributors accounting for a large proportion of contributions (Goodchild and Li, 2012, Sieber and Rahemtulla, 2010, Elwood et al., 2012). Without effective means of aggregation maps will either be shaped by the most active contributors, or map features will simply reflect the average of contributions.",

OSM contributions are aggregated primarily through crowdsourced review following a last-in, first-out model; users see only the most recent edit. Although this form of aggregation relies heavily on trust and does not directly leverage prior contributions, it has been shown that more edits of an OSM feature generally leads to greater positional accuracy (Haklay, 2010).

However, even in countries where GFT is not yet officially available, such as China (Kang et al., 2013) and South Korea (Cho et al., 2013), the system has been shown to complement the country\u2019s traditional influenza surveillance systems although an inability to search in the local languages remains a problem. In addition, analysis of the Google Trends\u2019 search frequency for the term \u2018Ebola\u2019 in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone showed a moderate-to-high correlation with epidemic curves for the outbreak in those respective countries (Milinovich et al., 2015) suggesting that internet-based surveillance systems have the potential to form an early-warning system in developing, as well as in developed countries.",

The fact remains that GFT has twice been caught out by the US annual flu season both under (2009) and overestimating (2013) national flu peaks (Butler, 2013). A similar approach to GFT which uses Wikipedia searches to estimate US influenza prevalence, was recently shown to be more accurate than GFT, performing well through both the 2009 and 2013 epidemics that tripped up GFT (McIver and Brownstein, 2014). Similarly, GDT estimates have been shown to be highly correlated with actual dengue incidence on a large (national) spatial scale (Chan et al., 2011, Althouse et al., 2011), yet results varied on a small (state) scale Gluskin et al., 2014. Gluskin et al. (2014) attributed this variation to the fact that GDT appears to work best in areas with intense transmission, particularly where local climate is well suited to this.",

As such, although novel surveillance systems are still a long way from replacing traditional surveillance methods, they can usefully complement conventional approaches (Milinovich et al., 2014), to the extent that they have become an important component of the influenza surveillance scene. For example, WHO\u2019s Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network uses such data as part of its day-to-day surveillance activities (Grein et al., 2000, Heymann and Rodier, 2001) and is authorized to act on this information (Wilson et al., 2008). In addition, internet-based data sources exist outside traditional reporting channels and as such, are invaluable to public-health agencies that rely on the timely flow of information across administrative borders.",

In addition, they are cheaper and more flexible than traditional systems. Nevertheless, they present important challenges including, biases associated with the population that chooses to participate, difficulty in adjusting for confounders due to patients\u2019 unwillingness to complete long surveys, and limited specificity because of reliance on syndromic disease definitions (Wojcik et al., 2014).",

The increasingly wide range of available spatial disease data may allow us to meet those challenges, assuming we see them as opportunities rather than problems; opportunities to convert aspects of the world that have never previously been quantified into valuable data that can shine a new light on health problems. Opportunities to develop timely and cost-effective online disease surveillance systems for developing nations that lack the necessary resources and infrastructure to implement traditional surveillance systems. Opportunities to transpose novel human health surveillance systems for use in animal health situations. And opportunities to respond to the increasingly complex disease problems facing us with state-of-the-art and spatially-explicit, risk-based disease surveillance and control strategies.",
