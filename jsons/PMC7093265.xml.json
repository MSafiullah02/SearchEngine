            "text": "Interest in preprints arose due to two broad factors. The first factor relates to concerns regarding the inefficiency of the peer review process [2]. It can take months or even years to publish an article presenting research findings. Most conventional journals determine whether to publish an article or to require further revisions through a peer review process, which involves evaluation of an article by two or three peer reviewers (researchers who are working in similar fields), revision by the author, and further assessment after the revision in order to ensure ethical and scientific reliability. Hence, it is inevitable for the peer review process to take considerable time. In situations like the Ebola, Zika, and COVID-19 outbreaks, early and transparent dissemination of research findings may lead to more expedited prevention and treatment efforts [3]. Traditional peer review is not compatible with the time constraints imposed by such circumstances, and preprints can therefore be considered as a supplementary method to address these issues.",

Of the various forms of reporting bias, a particular concern is publication bias, which involves choosing whether to publish research based on the content of the findings. As a result of publication bias, more significant results (statistically or non-statistically) tend to be submitted and published within a shorter window of time. Hence, a meta-analysis of published studies could overestimate the size of the effect [4,5].",

Since preprints are published with open access, they facilitate more expedient interactions with researchers in the same field. Authors can receive instant feedback from their colleagues and may identify critical flaws and errors. Moreover, it is easier to disclose research results that may not be suitable for journal publication; and preprints help junior researchers to build their academic careers. Since studies are uploaded onto public platforms, the timing of various authors\u2019 contributions can be clearly established, helping to prevent plagiarism of research ideas.",

One reason for this is that if non-peer-reviewed preprints are considered to be a source of scientifically sound evidence, they may be abused by interest groups or pharmaceutical companies looking for secondary gains. Unlike other academic fields such as mathematics and physics, medical research findings are discussed by the public and media, which often cannot distinguish between journal publications and preprints. Moreover, whereas preprints in mathematics and physics are subject to active discussion, leading to improvements in the academic quality of the research, fewer than 10% of preprints in biology and medicine receive comments, indicating that they do not tend to draw much attention [7]. The simultaneous distribution of different versions of preprints may add confusion to the interpretation of research findings.",
