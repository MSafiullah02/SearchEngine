This study showed the rate of mortality and NIV failure in the NIV group correlated with the severity of the patient\u2019s respiratory failure.2 An earlier multicenter study by Antonelli et al3 showed that an early 1-hour NIV in ARDS patients on ICU admission could be helpful to clinically stratify them and avoid unnecessary intubation in more than half of the patient population.",

A higher level of pulmonary compliance and shunt fraction is seen in COVID-19 patients with severe ARDS compared to the expected levels of ARDS from other causes.5 An early study from Wuhan, China, showed an recruitment to inflation ratio (R/I ratio) lower than 0.5 in >80% of COVID-19 patients with severe ARDS, suggesting a significantly poor pulmonary recruitability in COVID-19.6 Disrupted vasoregulation due to vascular insult has been suggested to be the cornerstone of poor oxygenation in the early stages of ARDS in COVID-19. Thus, pursuing the common treatment approaches of applying high levels of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) may accentuate underlying microvascular injury and contribute to a worse outcome.7 Until we learn more about the pathophysiology, it may be wise to apply intubation and mechanical ventilation at the earliest signs of NIV failure or initially in those patients in whom failure of NIV is highly predictable.",
