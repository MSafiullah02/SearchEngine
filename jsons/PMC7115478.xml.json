To date several types of vaccines are available, including live-attenuated, inactivated, subunit or split, toxoid, conjugate, DNA, and recombinant vectored vaccines [2]. While conventional vaccines, like live-attenuated or inactivated wild-type, have successfully protected vaccinees from various infectious diseases over the years, they are not available for most infectious diseases and for those who cannot afford them. Conventional vaccine production methods, which predominantly use viruses and bacteria or their products, produced with classical production methods, are labour intensive, expensive, and time consuming, while some of the desired antigens cannot be produced in this way [3]. Furthermore, highly virulent pathogens can only be produced under expensive special safety conditions, while attenuated agents may have a tendency of reverting to their pathogenic form and can usually only be used in fully competent individuals [4].",

The advent of these novel technologies may also be expected to create opportunities for the development of vaccines targeting new indications and/or application fields. Since there are many major indications for which no or only unsatisfactory vaccines are available, like AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis, the exploitation of novel technologies, like the use of vector-based vaccine candidates or vector-based production of protective antigens, may eventually allow us to fill the gap of this unmet medical need. To date several vaccines for humans, based on GM technologies have been licensed (for review see e.g. [5], [6], [7], [8]) and a lot of candidates are in the pipeline.",

            "text": "An interesting approach for vaccine development based on GM technology is the use of vectors, which carry selected genes encoding antigens that induce protective immunity. They can either be used as vaccines proper, or for the production of antigens that are incorporated in vaccines. The present paper only deals with vectors that are actually used as vaccines and not just for the production of immunogens. Vectors can be classified in three different categories: viral, bacterial, and plasmid [9]. Vectors can either be fully replicative or only cause abortive infection, still allowing the expression of the desired immunogens. They can be administered either parenterally or via mucosal membranes [10]. A major advantage of vector-based GM technology, is that the immunogens of interest are de novo synthesized, thus not only allowing for the induction of antibody and T helper cell mediated immunity, but also for the induction of protective cytotoxic T cell responses, mimicking a natural immune response against the immunogen. This balanced immune response opens pathways that were previously inaccessible with traditional vaccine technology using \u2018non-live\u2019 immunogens. Especially the induction of CD8+ CTL responses may be of particular interest for vaccines against certain virus infections and cancers [11]. Our previous study provides additional insights regarding the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats of such technology [12].",

These CPC codes do not comprise specific vectors but are general indicators for vector-based vaccines. A large variety of different vector types are being patented for vaccine development (Fig. 1). According to the patent database, both \u201cmastadenovirus\u201d and \u201corthopoxvirus: vaccinia/variola\u201d are the most prominent vectors. Human adenoviruses are part of mastadenovirus genus, which in turn is a large genus of the adenoviridae family. It is notable that orthopoxvirus: vaccinia/variola as well as poxviridae appear in the patent results. The species vaccinia virus and variola virus are part of the genus orthopoxvirus, which belongs to the family of Poxviridae. The explanation behind this seemingly double occurrence is that CPC codes for both the species and the family are present in Espacenet.

Although no active clinical trials on malaria based on fowlpox vectors are provided in the clinical trials database (clinicaltrial.gov), literature shows that fowlpox vectors are being examined in combination with different vaccination regimens [70], [71]. Intervention strategies for these diseases represent a large unmet medical need, still causing over a million deaths every year [72]. With limited if any cure available, new methods might provide additional value to vaccine research and development, in hope for a breakthrough. This premise is confirmed by Fig. 4. Cancer, HIV, and malaria show a large presence in both patent and clinical trial databases, while Hib, Hepatitis A, and meningococcus show little development in patent and clinical trials stages in recent years. This implies a lower need for new vaccine technologies for these indications, as current vaccines based on conventional methods are apparently sufficiently satisfactory [73], [74], [75]. Table 7 also shows that very little vector-based vaccine trials are present for more or less treatable diseases such as HPV induced neoplasias, hepatitis B, and influenza. Apparently there is less medical need for vector-based vaccines for these indications, as vaccine candidates are available based on GM-based and non-GM-based techniques [76], [77], [78]. There is, a significant amount of active non-vector-based GM trials for these three indications, demonstrating the variety of GM techniques applied in vaccine development. For influenza and hepatitis B vaccine production, the use of recombinant DNA technology is already common practice [6], [79]. Therefore, the focus of research is on optimising the technology used, rather than on investing in new vector-based technology research.",

The reasons for this replacement is predominantly related to the safety and efficacy of MVA, as it only causes an abortive infection, while inducing an abundant expression of the target immunogen, leading to impressive protective immune responses [12]. The prominent use of adenoviruses as viral vectors is probably due to the considerable knowledge on this virus family, the ease of manipulation of the virus for use in vector-based vaccines, and the broad tissue tropism associated with this virus [40], [80].",

Without patents, anyone could start developing these vectors without legal consequences, leading to companies competing to sell the vaccine for the lowest price possible. When revenues from vaccine sales eventually do not lead to return on investment for past and future research and development there would be no incentive for the development of new generations of vaccines.

The most promising vectors for vaccine development at this moment appear to be poxvirus and adenovirus vectors. This may be concluded for their abundant use in the development of vaccines against diseases like HIV-AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis and different forms of neoplastic disease. It may be expected that the current efforts spent on developing vector-based vaccines, may lead to promising vaccine candidates for these indications and therefore hold promise for current and future unmet medical needs. Therefore, after the recent eradication of smallpox using Jenner\u2019s vaccinia virus as the first vaccine, this and other viruses may now be the basis for constructing vectors that may help us control other major scourges of mankind.",
