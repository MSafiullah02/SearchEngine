On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) had declared COVID-19 a pandemic because of alarming levels of its spread, severity and inaction [2]. COVID-19 is caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which is sufficiently genetically divergent from the closely related Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV), to be considered a new human-infecting betacoronavirus [3]. It mainly affects the respiratory tract and the illness ranges in severity from asymptomatic or mild to severe or critical disease. Although the current estimate of the case fatality rate of COVID-19 is < 5%, up to 15\u201318% of patients may become severe or critically ill, some of them requiring ICU care and mechanical ventilation [4].",

Since there is a high likelihood of duplicate publications on COVID-19 [9], especially, same set of patients being reported in English as well as Chinese or other languages, hence we restricted our search to papers published in English language only.

After carefully going through the abstracts and full texts (if needed) of these publications, only 207 potentially relevant studies were selected and evaluated in detail for potential inclusion. Of these 174 studies were excluded because of the following reasons: (1) 144 studies did not have comparative data on COVID-19 patients with and without composite endpoint; (2) 22 studies were small with less than 100 participants; (3) 7 studies did not have diabetes as one of the comparative factors; and (4) 1 study was a duplicate publication. Hence, remaining 33 studies were included in the qualitative as well as quantitative synthesis meta-analysis (Fig. 1).",

In spite of this limitation, the implication our meta-analysis will remain unchanged that diabetic need to be protected from COVID-19, and they will need extra care if infected. The second limitation of this meta-analysis is that we have not been able to document the role of glycemic control on the severity or mortality of COVID-19. It has been shown previously that poor glycemic control, in terms of high HbA1c, was significantly associated with increased risk of various infections [53,54].
