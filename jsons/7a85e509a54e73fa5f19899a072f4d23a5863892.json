            "text": "There is a growing international awareness of the health risks associated with water, and particularly in developing countries. For example: (i) a child dies in Africa every 30s due to malaria-a disease related to stagnant water, (ii) every year flooding causes many deaths world-wide, with infant mortality due to diarrhea from contaminated flood waters posing the biggest threat, and (iii) poor sanitation and its relation to hepatitis A continues to be a serious problem. A revealing measure of the extent of such global problems is that more than half of the hospital beds in the world today are occupied by people with water-related diseases. Addressing these issues mandates an interdisciplinary approach by the world's scientific and engineering community. In this spirit a workshop was held in Phoenix to provide a forum where epidemiologists, hydraulics researchers and other stakeholders of varied backgrounds (e.g., policy makers, environmental groups etc.) could all participate in a debate on a future agenda for hydro-epidemiology. The principal outcome of the workshop was a significant appreciation of the potential for interdisciplinary research and development in hydro-epidemiology and the major contribution that hydraulics professionals could offer, in partnership with the public health community, in addressing such water related disease control and prevention challenges. This report derives from papers presented at a three day workshop (2-4th December) on Hydroepidemiology held during the Fifth International Symposium on Environmental Hydraulics in Tempe, Arizona, held during December 2007. The invited and submitted papers have been condensed and synthesized to identify current activity and potential research contributions at the interface area between the environmental hydraulics and public health communities.",

            "text": "The title of this workshop was chosen because there is no discipline or community of scientists who would identify with or, more importantly, claim ownership of the term 'hydroepidemiology'. This field of study resides at the interface between the physical science communities; i.e. containing engineers, physicists, chemists and environmental science professionals, and the medical and public health communities concerned with disease transmission, health impact assessment and mitigation. The former is focused on the drive to understand and, where possible, model the physical processes relating to the transport, transformation and storage of toxicants and pathogens in the water column, whilst the latter is concerned with understanding their impacts within human populations and appropriate responses to observed and/or predicted patterns of illness. There are, however, very few international scientific forums where these communities can meet and communicate to encourage integration of effort between these, largely discrete, academic and practitioner communities. The workshop organizers hold chairs in Environment and Health (Kay) and Hydro-environmental Engineering (Falconer) and they invited key practitioners and academics to present examples of current work at this interface, with the joint aims of: (i) scoping the current baseline of activity; and (ii) identifying priority stakeholder needs and opportunities for this emerging research agenda. This report does not attempt to repeat the verbal presentations of all workshop speakers, rather, it seeks to identify cross cutting themes identified by speakers and other participants. These are used to summarize outcomes (i) and (ii) above. Presentations of the workshop can be accessed via:-http://www.aber.ac.uk/iges/staff/kaydavid.shtml",

This Directive requires member states to identify 'pressures and impacts' [14] then design a 'programme of measures' (Article 11) to ensure compliance with the microbiological standards set out in daughter directives such as the original Bathing Water Directive 76/160/EEC [2] and new World Health Organisation health-based standards for bathing waters recently agreed by the EU Parliament [4, 44, 67] . Article 1(2) of the new Bathing Water Directive (2006/07/EU) states \"The purpose of this Directive is to preserve, protect and improve the quality of the environment and to protect human health by complementing Directive 2000/60/EC\", further reinforcing the central place of microbiological water quality and catchment microbial flux analysis within the WFD strategy for water quality improvement. As EU members address the problem of designing new 'programmes of measures' to effect protection of impacted waters the absence of a literature and/or operational modelling tools able to guide policy decisions and underpin evidence-based interventions to effect pollution reduction are becoming all too apparent. This contrast with, for example, catchment-based modelling tools which have been applied to parallel catchment processes driving nutrient and sediment fluxes This science gap was noted in a recent review for the UK Government of the evidence-base available to underpin UK agricultural diffuse pollution control. This assessment [32] noted the emerging policy imperative to understand and predict catchment microbial fluxes and they described this area as 'the challenge of the 21st Century' (Page 4). They also noted the lack of research and regulatory attention to the microbial pollution area when compared to, for example, the nutrient parameters (see for example: [34] and [35, 36] .",

[45] reviewed the operation of microbial TMDLs in California and concluded that the longer US regulatory experience with examination of catchment microbial dynamics, through TMDL assessments, had not, to date, produced more operationally useful empirical science or modelling approaches which could be applied in the UK. In effect, many US authorities were defining FIO 'discharge' concentration limits for discharges to streams and coastal waters (in TMDL terminology the 'concentration-based pollutant allocations') which were simply set at the environmental 'receiving water' concentrations required for recreational and shellfish harvesting waters for relevant discharges (i.e. a geometric mean faecal coliform concentration in agricultural and surface drainage discharges to tributary streams of <200,100 ml \u22121 and a 90th percentile for faecal coliforms in direct discharge to the coastal water of <43,100 ml \u22121 ). Waste water treatment plants and boats were required to achieve a faecal coliform median of zero 100 ml \u22121 . The examples chosen did not address the spatial and temporal characteristics of the inputs or their fluxes which are more relevant than 'concentration'. Nor was the feasibility of achieving these criteria addressed. Additionally, sampling programmes were recommended which could not capture data on the hydrological events which studies world-wide have suggested account for >90% of the catchment-derived faecal indicator flux from diffuse source pollution [43, 49] .",

            "text": "An additional international policy driver for catchment microbial dynamics research emerged following the publication of the WHO guidelines for drinking water quality [68] . These advocated a new regulatory paradigm for drinking water protection based on 'water safety planning'. This mirrors the Hazard Assessment Critical Control Point (HACCP) approaches commonly applied in food processing industries and more recently applied to bathing beach management and shellfish protection through 'profiling' of coastal bathing and shellfish harvesting waters [48, 66, 67] . This development has generated the requirement for water undertakers to assess microbiological risks in water supply gathering grounds. Much of the early research and scientific information in this area has been driven by Australian water undertakers and research scientists and can be traced back to perceived risks from chlorine resistant protozoan parasites, principally Cryptosporidium spp. which have led to studies of both FIOs and pathogens in Australian water supply gathering grounds [7, 8, 19, [26] [27] [28] [57] [58] [59] [60] . Water undertakers in the EU are now applying similar approaches which imply maintenance of source water quality through the protection of gathering grounds. This is, in effect, a re-invention of the 'multiple barrier' approach to public health protection which was dismantled with the introduction of multiple use catchment policies in the developed economies and the consequential heavy reliance on treatment plant and supply system integrity to maintain water quality almost 60 years ago [1, 51] . Such a reinvention might also be prompted in part by the assessment of land condition by the Statutory body in England, namely Natural England (previously called English Nature), and the designation of significant areas of water supply catchments as 'unsatisfactory'.",

Satellite data acquisition systems and catchment-based modelling tools, such as SWAT, were shown to provide integrated solutions to problems identified during Water Framework Directive implementation in the EU and parallel problems world-wide. Prof Nigel Wright developed similar themes from a UNESCO-IHE perspective, exemplified by the concept that the water professional should seek both to 'assess vulnerability and increase resilience'. The use of the 'Flood Vulnerability Index' was explained using innovative applications of computational fluid dynamics and GIS modelling of flooding scenarios.

He noted that the: massive inter-basin water transfer project of India looms as a serious threat to the ecology of the region and survival of Bangladesh as an economically sustainable nation He predicted a 2-3 m water level reduction in the Ganges and Brahmaputra if abstraction plans are implemented and urged trans-boundary cooperation between all riparian states to effect integrated management of this globally important water resource system.",

Some 90% of wastewater is discharged to streams without treatment, producing very high FIO concentrations in Bogota and Magdalena rivers commonly exceeding 10 5 to 10 6 E. coli 100 ml \u22121 through urban areas. An integrated catchment approach to water quality and quantity management was seen as the most appropriate paradigm. A series of largely technocentric tools of catchment modelling with GIS data capture and multicriteria modelling of environmental, socio-economic and infrastructure constraints was explored to prioritize interventions.",

It is perhaps surprising therefore that the hydraulics professionals have been less involved in gaseous pathway research than in aquatic systems. This was redressed by Prof Joseph Lee, of Hong Kong, who reported a linked empirical and hydraulic modelling investigation of the airborne transmission of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus in high rise accommodation at Amoy Gardens in Hong Kong. The virus moved upwards within the building's utilities shaft and entered apartment units on the upper floors of Block E in Amoy Gardens. Horizontal spreading of the infection was then detected to other units in Block E by air movement between apartment units, then, after the plume reached the top of the shaft in Block E, the virus was spread to some units in Block B, C, and D by the northeasterly wind. This presentation provided an excellent illustration of the potential contribution which can be made by the hydrodynamic modelling community in providing exploratory and explanatory tools for epidemiological investigation, particularly in the context of real-time outbreak management where decisions are made which have immediate health significance, with catastrophic implications if the wrong outbreak control steps are taken. Thus, the illustration of the hydraulics contribution in broadening the 'outbreak control teams' disciplinary armory was a valuable contribution by this scientist.",
