With the evidence of organ failure, it was called severe sepsis, and this could lead to hypotension (septic shock) [1] . However, with the deep understanding of the pathophysiology of sepsis, sepsis has been known as both inflammatory and anti-inflammatory. Additionally, the classic use of SIRS could lead to overestimation of sepsis. For example, usual common cold could be identified as sepsis in classic definition [2] . With this background, new sepsis definition, Sepsis 3, was introduced with expert consensus, literature review, and finally big data analysis. Sepsis was defined as a \"life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection.\" They recommended the use of sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score as clinical criteria for sepsis in ICU encounters. More specifically, increase in SOFA score of two points or more should be used. In non-ICU encounters, quick SOFA score was recommended as screening tool, and qSOFA score of two or more was set to identify high-risk patients. The concept of classical severe sepsis was eliminated. Septic shock was newly defined as sepsis with fluid-unresponsive hypotension, serum lactate level greater than 2 mmol/L, and need for vasopressors to maintain mean arterial pressure of 65 mmHg or greater (Fig. 5.1) [3, 4] .",

Septic shock can be produced by any microbial infection (bacteria, virus, fungus, parasites, etc.), even if no organism is identified at nearly 50% of cases of septic shock.

Immune cells not only are able to recognize invading organisms and their products so they can destroy them but also release a series of mediators that can activate other cells. Toll-like receptors, among cell membrane receptors, are implicated in the recognition of pathogenic agents. Cellular stimulation activates intracellular signaling and results largely in the activation of transcriptional factors (including nuclear factor kappa B), which initiate proinflammatory reactions in turn. A number of cytokines, mainly tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1) and interleukin (IL)-1, are released by macrophages and other cells. TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1 are particularly important proinflammatory cytokines that can reproduce all features of septic shock including hypotension and development of multiple-organ failure (MOF) in animal studies. Antiinflammatory mediators including IL-4 and IL-10 are also released during the sepsis response, which limit the effects of proinflammatory mediators and can lead to a state of relative immunosuppression sometimes called immunoparalysis [7] . When sepsis is diagnosed, many patients are already immunosuppressed [8] .",

The other auxiliary cause of hypovolemia in septic shock results from increasing capillary leak and resultant loss of intravascular volume into third spaces. In septic shock, adhesion molecules on vascular endothelium and circulating cells (platelets, PMNs, and monocytes) are expressed by inflammatory reaction. Activated leukocytes adhere to vascular endothelium and migrate to subendothelial tissues.

Endotoxin, TNF-\u03b1, and IL-1 are the key mediators. The plasma levels of natural anticoagulants such as protein C, protein S, and anti-thrombin are significantly reduced in sepsis by reducing their synthesis and increasing their consumption and clearance. In early sepsis, thrombolysis is also stimulated with an increase in the levels of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1). The net result is a balance in favor of procoagulant processes, often leading to DIC and participating in the microcirculatory disorder that leads to MOF in many patients with sepsis. This sequence of events leads to consumption of coagulation factors and the fibrinolytic system is suppressed in late sepsis and that promotes capillary leakage, bleeding, and third-space fluid shift ( Fig. 5.2 ).",

Any microbes and killed organisms can cause myocardial depression. The direct effects of the toxic mediators as well as the knockon effects of host mediators of sepsis produce a septic shock. Septic shock causes direct myocardial depression. Even in the hyperdynamic stages, cardiac contractility becomes impaired during the early phase of septic shock. Circulating mediators, inflammatory myocardial cellular injury, and deranged metabolism interact synergistically to injure the heart during septic shock, and specific cytokines (most notably TNF-\u03b1 and IL-l\u00df), overproduction of NO, and possibly impairment in mitochondrial respiration may contribute to the cardiovascular dysfunction. Early in sepsis, although the cardiac output (CO) is increased, it is at the expense of ventricular dilation and decreased ejection fraction (EF). After vascular filling as a result of volume resuscitation, the hemodynamic status in septic shock is characterized by a fall in vascular tone associated with reduced systemic vascular resistance and a raised CO. Ejection volume and, particularly, CO may be maintained by an increase in diastolic volumes. Therefore, myocardial depression or dysfunction without any true cardiac failure would be developed and that may be associated with reduced cardiac output.",

For adequate fluid resuscitation, physicians should assess the fluid responsiveness which is the ability of cardiac output to increase in response to a fluid infusion. Static measures of preload such as filling pressures and volumes are poor predictors of fluid responsiveness. The use of CVP alone to guide fluid resuscitation can no longer be justified because the ability to predict a response to a fluid challenge when the CVP is within a relatively normal range (8-12 mmHg) is limited [34] . Therefore, dynamic indices which measure the hemodynamic response of the cardiovascular system to a controlled variation in preload have been introduced in clinical practice. The most investigated dynamic indices such as the pulse pressure variation measure the response to preload variations induced by mechanical ventilation. They are good predictors of fluid responsiveness, but they lose their value in patients with spontaneous breathing activity and arrhythmias.",

The reported amount of volume \"autotransfused\" by PLR ranges from 250 to 350 mL. Although PLR induces an increase in cardiac preload with its maximum effect at approximately 1 min, the effect is not sustained and vanishes completely when the legs are returned to the horizontal position. Thus, the hemodynamic effects of PLR must be assessed during a time frame of 30-90 s with a fast-responding method. No difference in diagnostic performance of PLR was seen in spontaneously breathing patients compared with controlled mechanically ventilated patients. Therefore, PLR has been proposed as an attractive way to predict fluid responsiveness and showed good diagnostic accuracy in metaanalysis [35] .

Similarly, septic patients with lactate clearance of greater than 20% during the initial 8 h of resuscitation had a 22% decline in the relative risk of mortality, compared with patients having lactate clearances of less than 20% [37] .

Many studies used a cutoff of 0.25 ng/ mL to suggest or encourage the initiation of antibiotics [51] . Multiple studies have investigated whether a PCT-guided algorithm can optimize the therapeutic approach in sepsis patients, mainly by monitoring PCT kinetics and stopping antibiotics once PCT has dropped to levels <0.5 ng/mL or by at least 80-90% of the peak in combination with clinical improvement. A meta-analysis including 1075 patients with sepsis or septic shock found overall reduced antibiotic treatment courses (6 days vs. 8 days) when PCT was used to guide therapy compared to routine care. There was no increase in 28-day or in-hospital mortality or in length of stay in the ICU or the hospital. The authors do stress that there was heterogeneity in PCT protocols across trials with regard to different cutoff values or different algorithms for medical or surgical patients [52] . A large RCT evaluated the use of PCT to de-escalate and stop antibiotics in critically ill patients who had received antibiotics <24 h before inclusion in the study for an assumed or a proven infection. The study found that the PCT-guided protocol shortened length of antibiotic treatment (5 days vs. 7 days in the first 28 days of admission) and lowered 28-day mortality from 25% to 19.6% [53] .",

Several retrospec-tive studies have suggested that obtaining cultures prior to antimicrobial therapy is associated with improved outcome [54] . However, the identification of an organism in culture in a patient with suspected sepsis is highly supportive of the diagnosis but is not necessary. The rationale behind its lack of inclusion in the diagnostic criteria for sepsis is that a culprit organism is frequently not identified in up to 50% of patients who present with sepsis nor is a positive culture required to make a decision regarding treatment with empiric antibiotics. Therefore, the desire to obtain cultures prior to initiating antimicrobial therapy should be balanced against the mortality risk of delaying a definitive therapy in patients with suspected sepsis or septic shock who are at significant risk of death [55] . Appropriate microbiologic cultures should be obtained before initiation of antimicrobial therapy from all sites considered to be potential sources of infection if it results in no substantial delay in the start of antimicrobials. This may include blood, cerebrospinal fluid, urine, wounds, respiratory secretions, and other body fluids. Two or more sets (aerobic and anaerobic) of blood cultures are recommended before initiation of any new antimicrobial in all patients with suspected sepsis [56] . All necessary blood cultures may be drawn together on the same occasion. Blood culture yield has not been shown to be improved with sequential draws or timing to temperature spikes [57] .",

Basal concept -To optimize tissue perfusion within 6 h post-diagnosis -To acquire the balance between the oxygen consumption (VO 2 ) and the oxygen delivery (DO 2 ) within 6 h post-diagnosis, but there have been no methods to estimate VO 2 during the acute phase of sep-sis [27] . Therefore, the acute management of sepsis should be focused to increase DO 2 [58] . The formula to calculate DO 2 is as follows: DO 2 \u2248 CO \u00d7 1.34 \u00d7 [Hb] \u00d7 SaO 2 -To increase DO 2 , cardiac output, hemoglobin concentration, and arterial oxygen saturation should be increased [59] . When adequate oxygen is provided, an increase in cardiac output can be a primary target for an increase in DO 2 . -Cardiac output is calculated by stroke volume multiplied by heart rate. And the three components which contribute to make a stroke volume are preload, afterload, and myocardial contractility. Therefore, the basal concept of initial management to acquire optimal cardiac output is to maintain optimal preload, afterload, and contractility with an appropriate range of heart rate within 6 h post-diagnosis [ [61] . Because of the ease of accessibility and safety, CVP is the most commonly used parameter for static volume status in clinical setting [62] . However, many of the critically ill patients have structural or functional problems in pulmonary circulation system; CVP plays a limited role in the estimation of acute-phase volume status in patients with septic shock [63, 64] . And thus, alternative parameters including the diameter and/or collapsibility of inferior vena cava (IVC) are tested [65, 66] . -Initial hydration is the most important process to optimize preload and acquire appropriate tissue perfusion. But overhydration which induces fluid overload resulting in tissue edema and additional microcirculatory dysfunction should be avoided [67, 68] . Previous studies reported that fluid overload contributed to an increase in the mortality of patients with septic shock [69] . Therefore, the repeated measurements of dynamic fluid responsiveness should be combined with the measurement of static volume status. -The parameters monitoring static volume status have another limitation. They cannot reflect dynamic fluid responsiveness during initial resuscitation [61] . Therefore, adjunctive methods to predict dynamic fluid responsiveness, such as pulse pressure variation (PPV > 13%), stroke volume variation (SVV > 12%), passive leg raising (PLR), and mini-fluid challenge (stroke volume index >6% after 100 mL of fluid challenge), have been developed and applied [70] [71] [72] [73] [74] [75] [76] . Among them, PPV and SVV should be measured in patients with full sedation and positive pressure ventilation and without dysrhythmia, and the use of them in emergency department is limited [71] [72] [73] [74] [81] . Furthermore, recent large clinical studies have shown that a transfusion threshold of the hemoglobin level of 7.0 g/dL was not different from 9.0 g/dL in the mortality of patients with septic shock [25, 82] . -Therefore, the current guideline recommends an erythrocyte transfusion threshold of 7.0 g/dL in patients with septic shock in the absence of myocardial infarction, severe hypoxemia, or acute hemorrhage [27, 83] .",

However, some studies showed that because of hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis, balanced crystalloids may be better than 0.9% saline for initial resuscitation (Table 5. 2) [86, 87] . -To optimize preload, adequate fluid therapy should be provided. However, a sustained positive fluid balance after initial resuscitation has been reported to be harmful [88, 89] . Therefore, after preload optimization, fluid therapy should be cautiously performed with various monitoring devices to estimate the present volume status of patients. -Although there have been no data supporting the amount of fluid volume after the 30 mL/kg of 5% albumin administration [32, 90] . Albumin administration can reduce fluid balance in septic shock patients who require substantial amounts of crystalloids. However, in patients with severe pneumonia or brain pathologies, the routine use of albumin should be avoided because the leakage of albumin can induce edema in lung or brain resulting in clinical deterioration [32] .",

Antibiotics treatment for sepsis should be Taken together, sepsis should not be managed with one magic bullet even though some basic management (for example, early fluid management) could be same. The wide epidemiologic range of sepsis over the world or even in same country could also be explained by various definitions of sepsis, which could make it difficult to see the trend or effect of treatment when tested in large clinical trials.",

Also, the design of preclinical study should be mentioned. For example, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) model has little chance to be translated into human study [107] . No patients visit to the emergency department with LPS injection. With this background, recently the cecal ligation and puncture model has gained popularity. However, the diverse method used in this model could affect the translation, and efforts to standardize the method are under progress (Minimum Quality Threshold in Pre-clinical Sepsis Studies, MQTiPSS). Considering cecal ligation and puncture model, the animals usually get the fluid and antibiotics [107] . In real clinical situation, however, we perform source control and administer vasopressor, or ventilator care, if necessary as well as just one-shot antibiotics and fluid [108] . These affect clinical course dramatically. In these days, a few research centers run mouse or rat ICU, and this might help translation of preclinical research to clinical practice.",
