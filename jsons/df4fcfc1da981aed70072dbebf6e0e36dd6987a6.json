We derive analytical expressions for the epidemic threshold of the susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) and susceptibleinfected-recovered dynamics, as well as upper and lower bounds for the disease prevalence in the steady state for the SIS scenario. Using the quasistationary state method, we numerically show the existence of disease localization and the emergence of two or more susceptibility peaks, which are characterized analytically and numerically through the inverse participation ratio. At variance with what is observed in single-layer networks, we show that disease localization takes place on the layers and not on the nodes of a given layer. Furthermore, when mapping the critical dynamics to an eigenvalue problem, we observe a characteristic transition in the eigenvalue spectra of the supra-contact tensor as a function of the ratio of two spreading rates: If the rate at which the disease spreads within a layer is comparable to the spreading rate across layers, the individual spectra of each layer merge with the coupling between layers. Finally, we report on an interesting phenomenon, the barrier effect; i.e., for a three-layer configuration, when the layer with the lowest eigenvalue is located at the center of the line, it can effectively act as a barrier to the disease. The formalism introduced here provides a unifying mathematical approach to disease contagion in multiplex systems, opening new possibilities for the study of spreading processes.",

Because of their fundamental nature and simplicity, two particular models have received special attention by the scientific community, the susceptibleinfected-susceptible (SIS) and the susceptible-infectedrecovered (SIR) models. In both models, an infected individual spreads the disease to its neighbors at a given (spreading) rate, and infected individuals recover at some other rate. The difference between both scenarios lies in the fact that in the SIS case, once recovered, infected individuals can catch the disease again; therefore, they go back to the susceptible state. On the contrary, in the SIR model, recovered individuals are supposed to acquire permanent immunity and do not play any active role in the spreading process anymore. There are many other variations of these two models, including more realistic and intricate compartmental models [1] . However, these two schemes are sufficient to capture the main phenomenology of disease dynamics-and many other contagion-like processes-including the onset of epidemics, while remaining simple.",

However, most realworld networks are heterogeneously organized, leading to the reexamination of previous results considering nontrivial patterns among individuals, such as power-law degree distributions [4] [5] [6] . In Ref. [7] , the authors presented the heterogeneous mean-field approach (HMF), showing that the epidemic threshold tends to zero in the thermodynamic limit on scale-free networks when the characteristic exponent is less than 3 . This observation about the role of network organization completely changed our previous understanding of how disease outbreaks should be modeled and controlled, placing the focus of attention not only on new ways to model disease dynamics but also on the incorporation of real contact patterns in the dynamical settings [3, [8] [9] [10] [11] .",

For instance, instead of the HMF approach, one can adopt the quenched mean-field (QMF) method, where a specific network is fixed and the dynamics is modeled in terms of nodal probabilities [12, 13] . The results obtained with the latter approach show that the epidemic threshold depends on the inverse of the leading eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix [12, 13] ; a similar result was also obtained using a discrete Markov chain approach [14] . Other scenarios explored recently include the case of temporal networks [15, 16] , competing and interacting diseases [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] , as well as the inclusion of human behavioral responses [24] [25] [26] .",

            "text": "However, the vast majority of the works so far deal with single-layered networks, despite the fact that many real systems exhibit a large degree of interconnectivity and hence should be modeled as multilayer networks [27] . Such systems represent multimodal, multicategorical, or temporal interactions, such as social relations, the ecosystem formed by different online social networks, or modern transportation systems [27] . Cozzo et al. [28] showed that disregarding the multilayer structure can lead to misleading conclusions, missing fundamental aspects of the critical dynamics of spreadinglike processes. Such findings reinforce the importance of a more detailed investigation of contagion processes on multilayer networks. Here, we develop a theoretical and computational framework for the analysis of disease spreading, generalizing the results of Ref. [13] to multilayer networks. A continuous counterpart to the model presented in Ref. [28] is provided in terms of the tensorial notation introduced in Ref. [29] . Our methodology allows for several new results. First, we are able to write down, in a compact form, the equations describing the disease dynamics in a multilayer system. Second, we derive the corresponding epidemic thresholds for the SIS and SIR cases, as well as establish bounds for the prevalence of the disease in the SIS scenario. More importantly for future works, we identify previously unnoticed multiple susceptibility peaks and show that there is disease localization but that it takes place on the layers instead of on the nodes of a given layer. All these findings are traced back to the very topological nature of the system and described in terms of the eigenvalue spectra of the supra-contact tensor and the localization of eigenstates.",

A tensorial representation provides a natural and concise framework for modeling and solving multidimensional problems and is widely used in different fields, from linear algebra to physics. In particular, general relativity is completely formulated under the tensorial notation. Here, we use the representation formerly presented in Ref. [29] . We also adopt the Einstein summation convention, in order to have more compact equations: If two indices are repeated, where one is a superscript and the other a subscript, then such an operation implies a summation. Aside from that, the result is a tensor whose rank lowers by 2. For instance, A \u03b1 \u03b2 A \u03b3 \u03b1 \u00bc P \u03b1 A \u03b1 \u03b2 A \u03b3 \u03b1 .

This is because, in the layerwise localized phase, the components of the eigentensor are of order O\u00f01= ffiffiffi n p \u00de for all the nodes in the dominant layer and of order zero for nodes in other layers. Thus, one easily realizes that the correct finite-size scaling to take in order to characterize such a transition is m \u2192 \u221e; i.e., the number of layers goes to infinity while the number of nodes per layer remains constant. In fact, in this limit, IPR(\u039b) will vanish on one side of the transition point while remaining finite on the other side.

In addition, after obtaining the curves of \u03c7 \u00d7 \u03bb by the QS method, we also apply a moving average filter in order to get rid of the noise. Such an approach improves the visual quality of the plots and does not interfere with the results since the order of magnitude of the noise is smaller than those of the peaks corresponding to the transition points.",

            "text": "Results shown in this section are the numerical solutions of the ODE systems (3) (SIS) and (C1) (SIR) using a Runge-Kutta (4,5) algorithm [36] . We consider a two-layer multiplex network (m \u00bc 2), where each layer has n \u00bc 10 4 nodes. In order to build a multiplex network where the epidemic thresholds associated with the individual layers are well separated, we must guarantee that \u039b l 1 \u226b \u039b l 2 . Therefore, we chose the degree distribution of the first layer to be P\u00f0k\u00de \u223c k \u22122.5 , whereas that of the second layer is P\u00f0k\u00de \u223c k \u22124.5 . Both layers are created using the uncorrelated configuration model [37] . Moreover, we consider a multilayer network in which every node has its counterpart on the other layer. This pairing of nodes of different layers is made randomly. Each result is the solution considering one single (and fixed) multiplex network. Figure 2 shows the phase diagram considering the average fraction of spreaders for the SIS dynamics (or recovered for the SIR dynamics) as the macrostate variable as a function of the spreading parameters \u03bb and \u03b7 for a given recovering rate \u03bc \u00bc 1. The dashed white line denotes the epidemic threshold obtained from Eq. (6). In panel (a), we show the SIS scenario, while panel (b) corresponds to the SIR model. In both cases, it is possible to observe two changes in the system's behavior. The first change is in the epidemic threshold, while the second is near the epidemic threshold of the second layer. In addition, we note the agreement between the theoretical epidemic thresholds and the numerical results. Furthermore, the higher \u03b7, the lower the epidemic threshold, which is a consequence of the eigentensor problem. Also note that \u03c1 increases for a fixed \u03bb as \u03b7 increases, even for \u03bb \u223c 0, which means that in such extreme cases, the disease spreads mainly in the interlayer edges. Figure 3 shows the phase diagram for \u03bc \u00bc 1 and different values of the parameter \u03b7 for the SIS dynamics. For \u03b7 \u00bc 0, we have no interlayer spreading, while for \u03b7 \u00bc 0.5, we have a fixed spreading rate, independent of the intralayer rates. In addition, we also evaluated cases where the ratio \u03b7=\u03bb is constant. In Fig. 3 (a), we show the global behavior of the system, which is an average of the individual behavior of the layers, represented in panels (b) and (c), since both layers have the same number of nodes. Furthermore, we also observe that the two individual networks show different behaviors near the epidemic threshold [10] . The first layer [Fig. 3(b) ] has a lower epidemic threshold than the second. However, \u03c1 grows (as a function of \u03bb) slower in the first layer than in the second. This feature can be observed clearly in Figs. 3(b) and 3(c), where we show results for \u03b7 \u00bc 0, that is, when there is no spreading between the layers. Considering the discrete system, Cozzo et al. [28] verified the shifting in the dominated layer (the largest amongst all individual eigenvalues) as the ratio \u03b7=\u03bb increases. Here, we observe the same effect, as can be seen in Fig. 3 (c). Additionally, we can also note another global change approximately beyond \u03bb > \u00f0\u039b l 2 \u00de \u22121 . Our findings suggest the possibility of multiple phase transitions due to the multiplex structure of the network. It is noteworthy that, in spite of the similarities between our continuous model and the discrete model [28] , both represent slightly different processes. In the continuous case, two events cannot happen at the same time. On the other hand, in the discrete model, every node contacts its neighbors in one discrete time step. Despite these differences, the results show that both the continuous and discrete formulations are phenomenologically similar. ",

Some important aspects of the spectral properties are discussed in Appendix D, where we present an analytical approach to the problem of eigenvalue crossings (see Appendix D 1 a). We focus on two special cases in increasing order of complexity: (i) the identical case, presented in Appendix D 1 b, where both layers are exactly the same (i.e., there is a high correlation between the degree in each layer), and (ii) the nonidentical case, discussed in Appendix D 1 c, where both layers have the same degree distribution but different configurations.",

Both layers have hki \u2248 8 and n \u00bc 10 3 nodes on each layer, and the leading eigenvalues are \u039b 1 1 \u00bc 42.64 for the first and \u039b 2 1 \u00bc 21.29 for the second. Figure 4 shows the spectral properties of the tensor R\u00f0\u03bb; \u03b7\u00de as a function of the ratio \u03b7=\u03bb. In contrast to the identical layers (see Appendix D 1 b) and the case of statistically equivalent layers (Appendix D 1 c, Figs. 10 and 11), where some eigenvalues increase while others decrease, all the observed eigenvalues always increase in this case. Moreover, we do not observe any crossing or near-crossing behavior. Regarding IPR\u00f0\u039b\u00de, the same pattern as for the similar case is found: For small values of \u03b7=\u03bb and considering the first eigenvalue, the system appears localized in the first layer and delocalized in the second, while for IPR\u00f0\u039b 2 \u00de, it is the contrary. For larger values of \u03b7 \u03bb , both layers contribute equally to the IPR\u00f0\u039b\u00de. Furthermore, the main difference we observe for the current setup with respect to the two similar networks (see Fig. 11 in Appendix D) is that now no drastic change in the inverse participation ratio is found, as expected, since there is no near crossing.",

It is worth highlighting that a similar qualitative behavior can be seen in the results shown in Fig. 2(a) , where one can also observe a second change in the slope of \u03c1 near the leading eigenvalue of the second layer. This change also vanishes as the intralayer spreading increases. Since the tensor R\u00f0\u03bb; \u03b7\u00de plays a major role in the spreading process, our spectral results can help one understand the observed critical dynamics.

Moreover, IPR\u00f0\u039b 1 \u00de decays from 3 \u2272 \u00f0\u03b7=\u03bb\u00de \u2272 10, which coincides with the range where the remaining maximum in the susceptibility reaches higher values and is better defined. More interestingly, note that IPR\u00f0\u039b 1 \u00de is mainly composed of the contributions of the first layer for a lower spreading ratio, suggesting that it is localized on such layer. Therefore, our results suggest that the IPR\u00f0\u039b\u00de is a proper measure to detect and predict the observed localization phenomena, and potentially for m localization transitions, as we will show in Sec. VI.",

More importantly, for scale-free networks, such a point vanishes in the thermodynamic limit. Following the usual convention in the complex network literature, the first susceptibility peak observed in all the experiments can be classified as a critical point of the phase transition. At such a point, the dynamics goes from a disease-free state to an endemic state. On the other hand, the second susceptibility peak cannot be classified this way since the process is already in an endemic state. Although it cannot be considered as a critical point, we have a transition from a layerwise localized state to a delocalized state. In other words, before the second susceptibility peak, most of the events take place in only one layer (the one with the largest individual eigenvalue), while after this point, both layers are active and spread the disease.",

Therefore, we can map this problem onto an \u03f5-SIS model [38] , where each node has a probability of experiencing a spontaneous infection. Note that such a model does not present an absorbing state. In this mapping, we are interested in the behavior of the second layer, and we consider that the selfinfection \u03f5 is determined by the contribution of the first layer by means of the contacts between nodes in different layers, which are Poisson processes with parameter \u03b7. This would imply that we would not have a second-order phase transition.

Figure 7 shows the time evolution of a disease spreading in the second layer for different values of \u03bb and \u03b7. The initial conditions for these experiments consider that the first layer has an initial probability of a node being infected equal to 0.01, while in the second, every node spreads. Note that we chose this initial condition for visual purposes since any initial condition would result in a similar steady-state regime. In this way, during the transient state, we observe a decay of the fraction of infected individuals; then, at the metastate that configures the steady state, we observe a stochastic variation centered on the average value. In addition, such fluctuations tend to increase near a \"critical point.\" We observe that for \u00f0\u039b 1 1 \u00de \u22121 > \u00f0\u03bb.=\u03bc\u00de > \u00f0\u039b 1 2 \u00de \u22121 for \u03b7 \u00bc 10 \u22124 , the incidence is very low, of order O\u00f01=n\u00de; however, it is larger than zero. As we increase the value of \u03bb, we drive the system to its active state, being able to sustain the disease and spreading it in the intra-edge contacts. In addition, by increasing \u03b7 we are able to increase the incidence of the disease due to the intra-edge contacts. Near the critical point of the second layer, \u00f0\u03bb=\u03bc\u00de \u00bc \u00f0\u039b 1 2 \u00de \u22121 \u00bc 0.833, we can observe some features that are similar to a transition. From below, we observe that the lower the value of \u03b7, the longer it takes for the system to reach the steady state, similarly to what is expected in phase transitions. On the other hand, slightly above the critical point, the time it takes to get to the steady state decreases and the curves for \u03b7 \u00bc 10 \u22124 and \u03b7 \u00bc 10 \u22123 get closer. This suggests that the effects of intralayer spreading are the main source of spreading.

Note that we have two possible topologies for the network of layers: (i) a line graph and (ii) a triangle (which is a node-aligned multiplex). In its turn, the first can be arranged in three possible configurations by changing the central layer. In other words, we have four possible systems. In this section, we focus on two configurations, the multiplex case and the line \u00f02.3 \u00fe 2.9 \u00fe 2.6\u00de. Both cases summarize the richness of dynamical processes in interconnected networks, presenting a new phenomenon, the barrier effect of an intermediate layer. We proceed by analyzing the spectral properties of this multilayer system in terms of the inverse participation ratio and the susceptibility. Regarding the other interconnected networks, we present those complementary results and analyses in Appendix E. Additionally, in Appendix E 1, we show that increasing \u03b7=\u03bb also increases the role of the interlayer edges relative to the intralayer ones.

As \u03b7=\u03bb grows, the symmetry in the node-aligned multiplex dominates the eigenvector structure, and the contributions of all layers are comparable. As we show next, the different contributions of the layers to the total IPR\u00f0\u039b 1 \u00de are at the root of the multiple susceptibility peaks observed. Figure 9 shows the susceptibility as a function of \u03bb for different ratios of \u03b7=\u03bb. We observe three well-defined peaks on such curves when the ratio \u03b7=\u03bb is small. In addition, similar to the two-layer case, such peaks tend to become less defined and vanish as the ratio \u03b7=\u03bb increases. The third peak is less defined than the others because the average number of infected nodes is larger in this case. Consequently, the susceptibility tends to be lower since it measures the variance in relation to the average.

Since the middle layer has the lowest individual eigenvalue among the layers, it creates a barrier effect \"delaying\" the second transition.

However, here such shifting is compromised by the fact that the central layer is unable to sustain the epidemic process, acting effectively as a barrier for disease contagion.

This behavior implies that other dynamics and more complex structures can also be significantly affected by the interconnected nature of the system.

Using the QS method and Monte Carlo simulations, we have been able to precisely determine the transition points. We remark that the first susceptibility peak is a phase transition, from a diseasefree state to an endemic, but layer-localized, state. On the other hand, the second peak is a transition from a layerwise localized to a delocalized state, which is not a second-order phase transition. Additionally, we have proposed an analytical approach based on the use of the inverse participation ratio to characterize such transitions as a localization phenomenon, thus also connecting with Ref.

Aside from the intraedge configuration, we also impose that interedges connect a node with its counterpart on the other layer; i.e., every node has the same intradegree on all layers. Such a constraint imposes a high correlation between the degrees in each layer. Figure 10 shows the spectral behavior of such a multiplex as a function of the parameter \u00f0\u03b7=\u03bb\u00de. In the top panel, we present the inverse participation ratio of the first three eigenvalues, while in the bottom panel, we plot the first ten eigenvalues. When the ratio \u00f0\u03b7=\u03bb\u00de \u00bc 0, the eigenvalues have multiplicity 2, as can be seen on the left side of the bottom panel (approximately, since the figure starts from 10 \u22122 ). More importantly, those eigenvalues tend to behave differently: One increases, while the other tends to decrease. This behavior leads to the eigenvalue crossing (see Appendix 1 a). The inset of the bottom panel zooms out on the region where the crossing takes place. Note that the eigenvalues cross at the same value for which the inverse participation ratio shows an abrupt change. Indeed, the jump in the IPR\u00f0\u039b\u00de has its roots in the interchange of the eigenvectors associated with each of the eigenvalues that are crossing. Moreover, we stress that the abrupt change observed for IPR\u00f0\u039b\u00de is always present in such scenarios, but it could be either from the lower to the higher values or vice versa depending on the structure of the layers.",

Each layer of the multiplex network is composed of n \u00bc 1000 and hki \u2248 6. Since each layer is a different realization of the configuration model, both present a slightly different leading eigenvalue-the first \u039b 1 1 \u00bc 15.21 and the second \u039b 2 1 \u00bc 14.34. Figure 11 shows the spectral behavior of such a multiplex in terms of the largest eigenvalues (in the bottom panel) and the IPR\u00f0\u039b\u00de (in the top panel). Here, in addition to the global inverse participation ratio, we also present the contribution of each layer to this measure. Such an analysis is meaningless in the identical case since the contribution is the same. As shown in the figure, we observe that for small values of \u03b7=\u03bb, in regard to the first eigenvalue, the system is localized on the first layer and delocalized on the second. On the other hand, the picture changes when we focus on the second eigenvalue, as it is localized in the second layer but delocalized in the first.

In addition, the number of infected nodes is always larger than zero since it is not a disease-free state. Furthermore, we also observed that the fluctuations tend to be very low (see the right inset in each panel of Fig. 12 ). Regarding the fluctuations, it is noteworthy that, in a phase transition, they tend to diverge, which does not happen in our analysis, thus also ruling out a second-order phase transition as far as we are concerned. We also note that fluctuations are slightly higher for lower spreading rates, as can be seen by the error bars for \u03bb \u00bc 0.078, which is explained by the delocalization of our system. Furthermore, in Fig. 13 , we present the comparison of steady-state fractions. In each panel, we fix a value of \u03bb and compare different values of \u03b7. We emphasize the influence of \u03b7 on the final fraction of infected nodes in the second layer. Note that for \u03b7 \u00bc 10 \u22124 and small networks, the behavior exhibits a growing trend. This is due to the fact that for networks with n < 10 4 , the contribution of the first layer can be effectively neglected.

Moreover, as the structure of the network of layers is not trivial anymore, we find important differences regarding the spectra of such tensors for the different topologies of the network of layers. Figure 15 shows the spectrum of the four configurations of networks when varying the ratio \u00f0\u03b7=\u03bb\u00de \u00bc 1, 10, 100, and 1000. Observe that we do not show the ratio \u00f0\u03b7=\u03bb\u00de \u00bc 0 since it is just the union of the individual-layer spectrum. For \u00f0\u03b7=\u03bb\u00de \u00bc 1, the four configurations are very similar, especially the line graphs. In such a case, the interlayer edges are treated in the same way as the intralayer ones. In other words, they are ignored, and the network can be interpreted as a monoplex network. As the spreading ratio increases, the spectrum tends to be clustered near the values of the eigenvalues of the network of layers. Such a spectrum was analytically calculated in Sec. II and shown in Table I in the main text. Regarding the triangle configuration, the clustering of the spectrum as \u03b7=\u03bb increases is even clear. Triangles present the lowest eigenvalue with multiplicity two. On the extreme case of \u00f0\u03b7=\u03bb\u00de \u226b 1 (see Fig. 15 ), we have 2=3 of the values near the left extreme value, while 1=3 of them are near the leading eigenvalue. On the other hand, for the line configurations, the frequencies of the eigenvalue distribution is related to the position of the central layer. However, in the limiting cases, such differences are reduced. This pattern is naturally related to the increase of the spreading ratio: When \u03b7=\u03bb increases, so does the role of the interlayer edges relative to the intralayer ones. Consequently, the structure of the network of layers FIG. 14. Finite-size analysis of the susceptibility. In the main panel, we have the susceptibility as a function of \u03bb for different sizes of two-layer multiplex networks, where the first layer has hki \u00bc 16 and the second hki \u00bc 12. In this experiment, we fixed the ratio \u00f0\u03b7=\u03bb\u00de \u00bc 0.01. In the inset, we show the susceptibility of the two peaks as a function of the layer size, where the blue symbols refer to the first peaks while the green symbols refer to the second peak. In addition, the red lines are a linear fitting of those points.

Their main result is an abrupt structural transition from a decoupled regime, where the layers seem to be independent, to a coupled regime, where the layers behave as one single system. Here, we are interested in the supraadjacency tensor; however, we found a similar phenomenological behavior and a structural change of the system as a function of the interlayer weights, which in our case are determined by a dynamical process.",

Similarly, the experiments here are conducted in terms of the inverse participation ratio, as was done for the two-layer multiplex case. Figure 16 shows the tenth largest eigenvalues of the three-layer multiplex case. The dashed lines represent the leading eigenvalue of each layer. Note that the leading eigenvalue of the layer with P\u00f0k\u00de \u223c k \u22122.9 is the seventh largest in the network spectrum when \u00f0\u03b7=\u03bb\u00de \u00bc 0. We observe that there are no crossings in the observed eigenvalues, which is an expected result since the layers have different structures. Furthermore, it is important to remark that all networks of layers evaluated also show similar qualitative behaviors. The topology of the network of layers does not lead to qualitative differences in the dependence of \u039b i on \u03b7=\u03bb for the first ten eigenvalues. We also notice that, although it is only an approximation, perturbation theory would be valid roughly up to \u03b7 \u03bb \u2272 10. Figures 8 and 17 show the IPR\u00f0\u039b 1 \u00de.

Depending on the position of that layer in the whole system-i.e., central or peripheral layer-the contribution of the nondominant layers to IPR\u00f0\u039b 1 \u00de varies. In particular, when the dominant layer corresponds to an extreme node of the network of layers, the contribution of the other two layers will be ordered according to the distance to the dominant one. Consequently, when the dominant layer is in the center of the network of layers, the contributions of the nondominant ones are comparable-note that in panel (b) of Fig. 17 , there is no difference in the contribution to IPR\u00f0\u039b 1 \u00de for layers generated using \u03b3 \u00bc 2.6 and \u03b3 \u00bc 2.9.
