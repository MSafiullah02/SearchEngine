For coronaviruses, NP plays an important role in the host cell entry and virus particle assembly and release [13], [14], [15]. In particular, it binds to a defined packaging signal of viral RNA, leading to the formation of the helical nucleocapsid. NP is incorporated into virions by intracellular budding through a membrane containing three envelope proteins: the M glycoprotein [15], the E protein and S glycoprotein [16]. Additionally, NP has been proposed to be multifunctional with additional roles in replication, transcription and translation for coronaviruses [17], [18], [19].",

            "text": "To our knowledge, nucleocapsid protein (NP) of some kinds of viruses might self-assemble as oligomer when carrying out its biological functions [19], [20], [21]. While we are preparing this manuscript, Surjit et al. [22] published their result that SARS_NP is capable of self-association through a C-terminal 209-amino-acid interaction domain, even though there is lack of detailed description for this work. Additionally, Jaenicke and Seckler [23] reported that oligomeric proteins always form intermediate and give more than one transition during unfolding. Nevertheless, whether NP forms intermediate during unfolding has not yet been reported elsewhere. In this report, we used non-denatured gel electrophoresis and size-exclusion chromatographic techniques as well as surface plasmon resonance (SPR) technology based Bicore3000 for trying to investigate quantitatively the possible assembly features of SARS_NP. The results suggested that in the absence of genomic nucleic acid, SARS_NP tends to form dimer at a low concentration, and trimer or polymer at higher concentration. In addition, the unfolding and refolding characterizations of SARS_NP dimer caused by thermal- and chemical denaturant-induced denaturations were also inspected by fluorescent and CD spectral investigation, it is found that SARS_NP exhibits its most stable conformation near pH 9.0, and its oligomer dissociation and protein unfolding seem to be of coinstantaneous occurring events.",

The result was shown in Fig. 1A, where the protein (0.5 mg/ml) was mixed with 4 M urea, then used as a reference for monomer on native gel. It is found that at its low concentration around 1.0 mg/ml, SARS_NP tends to form largely in monomer involving a small quantity of dimer (Lane 1), and the amount of dimer is fortified with the increasing concentration of SARS_NP (\u223c1.5 mg/ml) as indicated in lane 2. When the protein concentration was higher (\u223c3.0 mg/ml), the trimer state of SARS_NP appeared (Lane 4). Such a result suggested that homo-oligomerization of SARS_NP is of concentration dependence. Due to the difficulty in obtaining large quantity of soluble SARS_NP and the weak visualization of Coomassie brilliant blue dye for SARS_NP in gel, higher polymer than trimer could not be obtained for SARS_NP by native gel.",

This is in agreement with the results of non-denatured gel electrophoresis that oligomer formation of SRAS_NP is of concentration dependence. According to Fig. 1B, SARS_NP at 0.2 mg/ml contained equivalent ratio of monomer and dimer, and at 2.5 mg/ml, it existed as a mixture with more dimer and less monomer and trimer. It is noticed that in native gel experiment, SARS_NP at different concentrations existed mostly in monomer state.

To avoid the non-specific interactions, an equivalent amount of lysozyme was immobilized on the sensor chip as a reference. As shown in Fig. 2\n, even under very low concentrations (below 4 \u03bcM or 0.2 mg/ml), SARS_NP has tendency to assemble as dimer based on the fact that the binding curves in the sensor gram showed saturation tendency at 2000 RU, nearly equivalent to the coupling level of 2400 RU. This result is in accordance with the fact obtained in size-exclusion chromatography experiment that SARS_NP exists as oligomer at 0.2 mg/ml. Furthermore, as indicated in Fig. 2, when SARS_NP concentration was higher than 4 \u03bcM (0.2 mg/ml), the binding level exceeded the immobilized one (2400 RU) on the sensor chip and increased in a linear way; this may be tentatively attributed to the formation of trimer (or higher polymer) for SRAS_NP. Therefore, based on the results from the non-denatured gel, gel filtration analyses and the preliminary SPR data, it is suggested that SARS_NP might exist in oligomer, more probably dimer, as the basic functional unit in vivo. As can be seen from Fig. 2 (dotted curves), the trimer (or higher polymer) of SARS_NP departed quickly firstly then appeared as the similar dissociation course to that of dimer, suggesting that during the dissociation course of SARS_NP oligomer, it firstly dissociates into dimer. The quicker dissociation course indicates that the structure of SARS_NP polymer is possibly less compact than that of its dimer.",

It could be also found from Table 2 that when pH became higher or lower than 9, the stability of this protein decreased as reflected by the reduced values of C\nm and \u0394G\nu\nH2O. The results from the urea-induced denaturation investigated by fluorescence and far-UV CD spectra are shown to be in good agreement with each other (Table 2).",

The equilibrium unfolding transitions induced by these two denaturants are not always similar to each other, and the difference might be more related to the ionic character for GuHCl [38]. GuHCl-induced unfolding of SARS_NP obeys the similar transition pattern as the urea-induced unfolding. However, as shown in Table 2, \u0394G\nu\nH2O obtained by GuHCl-induced unfolding is a little bigger than that by urea-induced unfolding, at pH 9.0, for example, 7.1884 kcal/mol for urea-induced unfolding and 7.801 kcal/mol for GuHCl. Such a difference in free energy of unfolding may thus be also attributed to the ionic effect of GuHCl.",

SARS_NP is prone to assembling itself as dimer below \u223c4 \u03bcM and incompact oligomer at higher concentration (over 4 \u03bcM) in the absence of genomic RNA. SARS_NP might exist in oligomer, more probably dimer, as the basic functional unit in vivo. Thermal and chemical denaturant-induced denaturations of SARS_NP are subject to the two-state transition model: N\u21c4U. In addition, it is found that the dissociation of subunit and loss of SARS_NP structure are of simultaneous events. The denaturation investigation has proved that SARS_NP shows its most stable conformation near pH 9.0 with the highest \u0394G\nu\nH2O and \u0394G\u00b0. The electrostatic interactions among the charge groups make a significant contribution to the conformational stability for SARS_NP. Thermal-induced unfolding and refolding are irreversible, while urea-induced unfolding of SARS_NP is nearly reversible.",
