Dong et al.\n9 also reported that administration of recombinant fusion protein of murine IL-35 and human Fc fragment (rIL-35) reduced eosinophil counts in BALF. Li et al.\n10 documented a reduction in the numbers of inflammatory cells and levels of IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, and IL-17 in BALF with administration of adenovirus expressing IL-35. These findings suggest that IL-35 can attenuate asthma. However, reports of IL-35 in relation to allergic rhinitis are very limited.",

(Shizuoka, Japan), were sensitized with ovalbumin (OVA, grade V, Sigma\u2013Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and 2 mg Al (OH)3 intraperitoneally twice on days 0 and 14. These mice were also challenged intranasally (i.n.) on days 21 through 27 with OVA (200 \u03bcg). Intranasal administration (40 \u03bcl saline) of 0.1 \u03bcg recombinant fusion protein of murine IL-35 and human IgG1 Fc fragment (rIL-35, Chimerigen Laboratories, San Diego, CA) was performed an hour before OVA intranasal challenge on days 21 through 27. In a preliminary experiment with administration of 0.01 \u03bcg and 0.1 \u03bcg of rIL-35, we determined that 0.1 \u03bcg was more suitable, because there were bigger differences between the rIL-35 group and the control groups in the experiment with 0.1 \u03bcg (data not shown). In the control groups, intranasal administration (40 \u03bcl saline) of recombinant human IgG1 Fc fragment (rFc, AdipoGen, San Diego, CA, USA) only (0.1 \u03bcg, rFc control group) or PBS only (PBS control group) was performed an hour before OVA intranasal challenge on days 21 through 27. A schematic protocol of immunization and treatment is shown in Figure 1\n. rIL-35 and rFc were both produced in the same cells, CHO cells. Nasal tissue and cervical lymph nodes (CLN) were collected on day 28. Mice were housed in an environmentally-controlled animal facility at Nagoya City University in Japan. The protocols were approved by the Guidelines for Care and Use of Animals of Nagoya City University. Every effort was made to minimize the discomfort of the animals.",

IL-10 can maintain and enhance Foxp3 gene expression,23, 27 although intranasal administration of rIL-35 increased IL-10 production in CLN. We also previously reported that rIL-35 enhanced IL-2 production in vitro. IL-2 is essential for induction of Foxp3+ regulatory T cells by TGF-beta, and can induce expansion of Foxp3+ regulatory T cells.28, 29 Furthermore, IL-2 receptor beta-dependent STAT5 activation is required for the development of Foxp3+ regulatory T cells.30 The mechanism of immune response is complex in vivo. Considering the above, IL-35 may enhance Foxp3 gene expression through an increase the production of IL-2 and IL-10 indirectly, but not directly.",

However, Haeryfar et al. showed that Treg depletion significantly augmented CD8+ T cell responses, IFN-gamma production, and cytolytic activity in response to influenza virus.31 Boettler et al. also reported that Treg suppressed influenza virus-specific CD8+ T cell proliferation.32 Considering this, there is a risk that intranasal administration of IL-35 increases airway infection through facilitation of Tregs. In contrast, Terrada showed that injection of influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA)-specific Treg controlled uveoretinitis, and deletion of Tregs exacerbated clinical signs of uveoretinitis.33 Induced Tregs in coronaviral infection also protects against greater severity of the disease.34 Anghelina et al.\n35 showed that Tregs depletion resulted in increased mortality in coronavirus-induced acute encephalitis, and transfer of Tregs increased survival from 0% to 50%. At the moment, the association between Tregs and airway infection is unclear. The effect of Tregs on airway infections may vary depending on the situations. To elucidate the association between Tregs and airway infections, further studies are needed.",
