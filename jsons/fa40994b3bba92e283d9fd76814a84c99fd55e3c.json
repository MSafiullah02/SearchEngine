Four horses which were part of a larger prospective study were observed to have saliva emanating from their upper oesophageal opening during endoscopic examination 21-58 months after LP. One other horse was referred with clinical signs of severe upper oesophageal obstruction 2 months after LP. Oesophageal reflux was noted endoscopically at rest in one horse and during exercise in 4 horses. Post operative coughing was reported in all 5 horses and 2 horses coughed severely when eating. Necropsy findings on the horse referred with signs of oesophageal obstruction were dilation of the proximal oesophagus associated with food impaction and fibrosis and thickening of the left cricopharyngeus and thyropharyngeus muscles.",

Thoracolumbar dimensions/symmetry were measured at predetermined sites every second month over one year and weight, work and saddle management changes were recorded. Descriptive statistics, and univariable and multiple mixed effects linear regression were performed to assess the association between management changes, horse-saddlerider factors and back dimension changes.
