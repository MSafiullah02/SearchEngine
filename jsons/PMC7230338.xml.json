This phenomenon potentially explains the heterogeneous diffusion of COVID-19 among countries (e.g., Nigeria in comparison with South Africa) or within them (e.g., South Sardinia in comparison with Lombardy).

For instance, the effect of the administration of chloroquine derivatives in areas where malaria is endemic seems to preserve these geographic areas (i.e., the least developed countries) from COVID-19 outbreak, despite some rare side effects (e.g., retinal toxicity).
