InthePre-Boreal Period birch forests replaced the late-glacial tundra-like vegetation. In theearly Boreal Period hazel immigrated and theeutraphent water plant communities reached their optimum. After that thermophilous deciduous forests gradually crowded out the birch woods and reached their optimum in the Atlantic Period. The lakes were increasingly filled with peat, theeutraphent character of the marsh vegetation weakened and ombrogenous bog communities spread across theregion. Shortly before theSub-Boreal Period the first indications of human interference in the forests were detectable. During the Sub-Boreal and Sub-Atlantic Periods the forest area was reduced gradually as a result of human activities and the spreading ofthebogs. Amore orless complete forest clearance tookplace in thelastthousand years.",

Jessen's pollen diagrams -although of great value -therefore offer only limited information. Because of this we examined another 5 metre deep profile in the area between Errisbeg and Lough Maumeen (the Dolan area). This area is a rather extensive, flat peat complex, the surface of which is interrupted locally by the tops of drumlins and 'roches moutonnees'. The bedrock here consists of schistose hornblende-plagioclase rocks, the Ballyconneely amphio , 2 3 \u2022 5 km bolites (LEAKE 1970) . We sampled the peat by means ofa Dachnowsky auger; the incoherence of the peat, however, prevented the sampling of a section of 50-100 em below the surface. We therefore sampled a supplementary profile, about 150 m away in a turf cutting, where a section from 20-120cm was taken by driving tin boxes into the peat wall. As we found that the palynological pattern at both sides of the hiatus in the main profile was parallel with that in the secondary profile, the hiatus in the main profile could be filled up without any problem (profile Dolan,jig. 4). Profile Roundstone II 5 of Jessen, whose location in the landscape corresponds rather well with that of the Dolan profile, has developed mainly since early Boreal times. In order to complete the picture of the palynological events in the environs of Roundstone, we combined the Roundstone II 5 diagram with parts of the Roundstone I 6 and II II diagrams, which give information about events in Pre-Boreal and Late-glacial times. At the same time we recalculated Jessen's data in such a way that the pollen sum includes pollen of all trees and shrubs as well as the pollen of herbs of drier habitats. The remaining palynomorphs (produced by herbs from wetter habitats and by spore plants) are expressed as percentage of the pollen sum. Though this distinction cannot always be sustained for all pollen species (Gramineae, for instance, should ideally be placed partly within, partly out of the pollen sum), the picture of the regional tree/non tree pollen ratio is thus not disturbed too much by the local pollen production of the marsh and bog vegetation. In the first column of the diagram (jig. 2) the curves ofaII pollen species belonging to trees and 'dry herbs' have been brought together; moreover a curve indicating the ratio of tree pollen to non tree pollen is given. In separate columns the curves of individual palynomorph types, partly included in the pollen sum, partly excluded from it, are specified. The Dolan diagram is constructed in the same way (jig. 3).",

According to SMITH (1970) and WATTS (1977) several modern Irish diagrams have proved that this period began with a Juniper maximum. This maximum has been dated at about 12160 years before the present (WATTS 1977) , which places this event in the Bolling Interstadial in continental nomenclature. Juniperus usually appears shortly before the passage of the tree-line (GAMS 1943 , FIRBAS et al. 1948 , FIRBAS 1949 , ZAGWJJN 1952 , BERTSCH 1961 . Unfortunately Jessen in his days did not detectthe (indistinct) pollen of Juniperus. Probably his Connemara pollen diagrams do not reach further back than the time of the Allered Interstadial. Zone II of these diagrams reflects a non-local 'pollen rain' consisting of more than 85 %non-tree pollen (mainly Gramineae and especially Empetrum nigrum); towards the top of this zone this percentage has dropped to about 65. In contrast to this decline there is a marked increase of the Betula pollen and a temporary expansion of the pollen of Salix. There is also a certain increase of Pinus pollen, but the percentages are such that they Can be explained by long distance transport. The pollen of Myriophyllum alterniflorum and the Cyperaceae is numerous, while the spores of Polyp odium vulgare are represented as well. Finally some pollen of Epilobium sp. and Artemisia sp. was recorded, and some spores of Dryopteris( Lastrea) sp. and Lycopodium selago were observed.",

In zone III of the Roundstone diagrams a decrease of Betula can be observed indeed, but the minimum lies on such a high level, that it is doubtful that in Connemara the tree birches were in retreat to such a considerable degree as Smith supposed. On the other hand part of the birch pollen found in this zone could have been produced by dwarf birches (Betula nana). The Betula decrease in the diagrams probably would have been more marked if Jessen had drawn into his counts the pollen of many herbs which -as appears in more recent research -occur abundantly in zone III of many Irish profiles (SMITH 1970) . The fact that the total pollen production in Connemara decreased considerably during the Younger Salix herhacea Period is clearly shown by the maximum of Pinus pollen; the pine had not yet reached these regions at that time and its contribution to the 'pollen rain' was caused by long distance transport.",

In the latter profile the spectra from 60 up to and including 100cm beneath the surface come from an auxiliary profile at about 150 m distance (see section 3). The trend in the pollen flora, found in the Sub-Boreal parts of the profiles, continues in the early Sub-Atlantic parts: the non-arboreal pollen gradually increases at the expense of the tree pollen. Ulmus declines to very low values; Quercus decreases. On the other hand Fraxinus continues to expand somewhat.

The position of this open vegetation with respect to the prevailing winds makes this quite possible: in the last one and a half millennium, the originally wooded zones where the vegetation was seriously disturbed by man were most probably situated where they are today, namely, in a strip of I to I! kilometre along the coast, southwest of the sampling spots of the Dolan profile, at a distance of I to 2 kilometres ( fig.  4 ).

The Cyperaceae pollen was produced by the local vegetation (Eriophorum vaginatum, E. angustifolium, Scirpus caespitosus, Rhynchospora alba etc.) and by Phragmitetea and Parvocaricetea growing nearby. The presence of Myrica gale points to the fact that Parvocaricetea were not far away; the presence of pollen of the Ranunculaceae type (Ranunculus jlammula?) might confirm this. The pollen of the Potentilla/Comarum type (Potentilla erecta, Comarum palustre?), of the Rubiaceae type (Galium palustre, G. hercynicum?) and the hardly recognizable Pedicular is pollen (Pedicularis palustris, P. sylvatica?) could ha ve been produced by both Parvocaricetea and Nardo-Callunetea in the neighbourhood.
