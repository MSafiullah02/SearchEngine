The more anatomically extensive the repair is, the higher the risk. Patients that have shaggy aorta (aortic intra luminal wall thrombus) seem to be at even higher risk due to athero-embolic embolization peri-procedurally (2). In addition, complications leading to drop in blood pressure in the perioperative period are also considered aggravating factors. These can consist of perioperative bleeding complications often connected to poor iliac access (narrow iliac diameter preventing stent graft delivery). Due to these risks, if possible, a staged approach is recommended for elective TAAA repair (3, 4). This allows both for collateral network mobilization to the SC and avoids some risks of perioperative bleeding complications occurring in the same setting as a complete elective TAAA repair (5, 6).",

His gastrointestinal symptoms were difficult to interpret in the setting of his diagnosis of Crohn\u2019s disease as well.
