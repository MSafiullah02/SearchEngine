Thus, more than one-third (35%) of all presentations are for digestive diseases. In 2009, in the United States, the cancer statistics revealed 275,720 new cases of GI cancer, with colorectal and pancreatic cancer in the top 10 for both men and women.2 There were 135,830 deaths due to GI cancer, with colorectal, pancreatic, hepatic, and esophageal cancers in the top 10 for both men and women, except for esophageal cancer, which was only listed for men (Fig. 1\n).2 Furthermore, 2 of these 3 cancers that have an increasing mortality were GI tract cancers for both genders, with esophageal and hepatic cancers among men and pancreatic and hepatic cancers among women. Worldwide the rates of digestive diseases are staggering.",

The landmark article by Sir Austin Bradford Hill in 1965 titled The environment and disease: association or causation? became widely known as the Bradford Hill\u2019s criteria.10 There were 8 criteria that were required to be met to determine a cause-and-effect relationship (Box 2\n). It is usually difficult to meet all these criteria, particularly when trying to find the cause-and-effect relationships between organisms in the small intestine or colon because of the large number of organisms living in these environments. Even for H pylori infection and the relationship with gastric cancer, although it is currently the only bacterium classified as a class I carcinogen, the evidence supporting this relationship is not complete in terms of Bradford Hill\u2019s criteria.Box 2Bradford Hill\u2019s criteria for causality\nConsistency: The association is consistent when results are replicated in studies in different settings using different methods.Strength: This is defined by the size of the risk as measured by appropriate statistical tests.Specificity: This is established when a single putative cause produces a specific effect.Dose-response relationship: An increasing level of exposure (in amount and/or time) increases the risk.Temporal relationship: Exposure always precedes the outcome.Biologic plausibility: The association agrees with currently accepted understanding of pathobiologic processes. This criterion should be applied with caution.Coherence: The association should be compatible with existing theory and knowledge.Experiment: The condition can be altered by an appropriate experimental regimen. Experiment is possibly the most important support for a causal relationship.\n",

            "text": "There are a variety of methodological and technical issues related to infectious agents and their role in digestive diseases. For diseases of the colon, the major limitation remains the inability to completely identify these organisms. Identification of bacteria was mainly conducted using culture-based methods. Now, the focus in identification of bacteria is increasingly based on using molecular techniques. Many of these techniques allow the detection and identification of viable but nonculturable cells that are metabolically active but not reproducing. Gene sequencing using single-stranded RNA has been a key method in being able to elucidate multitudes of organisms that remain unknown. At present, there are approximately 9000 bacterial species, and this number is estimated as just the tip of the iceberg. The development of molecular methods offers great promise not only in research and development but also in the diagnostic setting (eg, stool samples) (Table 4\n).11, 12 Clearly, metagenomics, in which genetic material is directly retrieved from environmental sources, will play a critical role in the future development of determining infectious agents of the GI tract. The use of high-throughput technology has already produced important findings in relation to the GI tract microflora, including the differences between adults and children, with numerous uncultured organisms being the crux of the normal human adult gut flora which remain stable but other organisms change depending on environmental and genetic factors, whereas in infants there appear to be a constant transformation of organisms over time (Figs. 3 and 4\n).11 There have been several new detection methods developed, with some of these using nanoscale electrochemical detectors and others using DNA sensors (extrachromosomal DNA).13 The use of stable-isotope probing is also being investigated, but even this technique has limitations.14 Although these technologies are increasing the understanding of the gut microflora, there remains large gaps of knowledge regarding the metabolic functions of these organisms and the relationship they have with human GI disease. These will be extremely fruitful areas of research and development in the coming years.",
