            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was recognized in late 2002, and by the end of the outbreak in July 2003 more than 8000 cases and 774 deaths were attributed to SARS worldwide (Kuiken et al., 2003). A new coronavirus, termed the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), was isolated from patients with SARS (Drosten et al., 2003, Ksiazek et al., 2003, Poutanen et al., 2003). Soon after the disease was recognized, the ability to experimentally infect and induce interstitial pneumonitis in cynomolgus macaques with SARS-CoV was demonstrated, thus fulfilling Koch's postulates and confirming that SARS-CoV was the causative agent of SARS (Fouchier et al., 2003, Kuiken et al., 2003). Efforts to develop an animal disease model for SARS have continued. BALB/c mice have been established as a good rodent model for the replication of SARS-CoV (Subbarao et al., 2004) and viral replication has also been demonstrated in ferrets and cats (Martina et al., 2003). Although pigs and chickens could be experimentally infected with SARS-CoV, these species did not support efficient virus replication (Weingartl et al., 2004). In addition to the importance of establishing the microbial etiology of a disease, animal models are critical to the study of disease pathogenesis and the evaluation of treatment and control strategies. Non-human primates have been useful in evaluating vaccines and studying disease pathogenesis for several respiratory viruses including influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, and human parainfluenza viruses (Crowe et al., 1993, Durbin et al., 2000, Murphy et al., 1982, Rimmelzwaan et al., 2001, Skiadopoulos et al., 2002). These studies demonstrated that the susceptibility of different monkey species to specific respiratory viruses is variable. However, assessment of the level of virus replication in the respiratory tract of these models has been very informative.",

Laboratory evaluations in AGMs revealed two findings that were not observed in rhesus or cynomolgus monkeys and were suggestive of systemic infection and may warrant further investigation. First, the hemoglobin concentrations and hematocrit of the four AGMs decreased by a mean of 25% by days 8\u201310 following infection and returned to baseline by day 27. The total white blood cell and platelet counts did not demonstrate a similar pattern. Second, liver enzyme elevations (alanine amino transferase and isocitrate dehydrogenase) were noted in the serum of two AGMs with peak levels at day 4 post-infection; these values returned to baseline by day 27.",

We did not euthanize the monkeys in our first study, so we were unable to determine whether there were any histologic changes associated with virus replication. In order to resolve these differences, we performed an additional study in six AGMs, where four AGMs received the same dose (106.3 TCID50) of SARS-CoV by intranasal and intratracheal administration and two were mock-infected. Two infected and 1 mock-infected animal were euthanized and necropsied on day 2 and the remaining two infected and one mock-infected animals were euthanized and necropsied on day 4. Combined NT swabs were collected daily and TL fluids were collected every other day till the animals were euthanized, so that we could determine how accurately NT swabs and TL samples reflected the level of virus replication in the lungs. At necropsy, trachea, nasal turbinates, and 12 to 14 samples from each animal's lungs were assayed for virus titration and histopathology and samples from the liver and spleen were examined for histopathologic changes.",

Moderate (AGM ID #443) to high (AGM ID #400) titers of virus were present in the tissue samples from the right lung on day 2, but the detection of virus was more patchy and titers were significantly lower on day 4 (Table 2). Virus titers in samples from the right lung were higher than in samples from the left lung, presumably because the right main stem bronchus is straighter and more of the intratracheally administered virus inoculum reached the right lung. There was no difference between the titer of virus in samples collected from the hilar region compared to those from the periphery of the lungs (data not shown).",

This study was performed before we established that virus titer in tissue homogenates exceeded titers seen in respiratory secretions, so only NT swabs and TL were collected from these animals following challenge. Virus replication was highly restricted in the respiratory tract upon challenge; virus was not isolated from the upper respiratory tract of any monkey and was isolated at a single time point (day 2) at the lowest detectable titer in the lower respiratory tract of 2 AGMs (ID #240 and #304). The possibility that this low titer represents residual virus inoculum cannot be ruled out. The AGMs had measurable Nt Ab present prior to challenge, but two of the AGMs (ID #131 and #240) developed a four-fold rise in titer (data not shown) suggesting that, although virus replication was restricted in the respiratory tract upon challenge, at least two monkeys were re-infected.",

SARS-CoV replicated to a higher titer and for a longer time in the respiratory tract of AGMs than in rhesus or cynomolgus monkeys, and the Nt Ab response correlated with the level of virus replication detected in the respiratory tract. Consistently higher titers of virus were seen in tissue homogenates at necropsy than in NT swabs or TL fluid collected before the animals were sacrificed, indicating that more virus was present in the tissues than in secretions. This observation is consistent with the clinical finding that severe lung disease can occur early in SARS cases, at a time when virus is not easily detected in respiratory secretions (Peiris et al., 2003). Histopathologic examination from AGM lungs revealed interstitial pneumonitis in association with SARS-CoV on day 2 that was resolving by day 4. IHC staining for SARS-CoV antigens and double staining showed that tracheal and bronchial epithelial cells and type 1 pneumocytes were involved early in infection. These findings are consistent with our findings in mice and hamsters infected with SARS-CoV, where antigen is detected in epithelial cells early in infection (Roberts et al., 2004, Subbarao et al., 2004). Primary infection protected AGMs from re-infection with SARS-CoV.",

The key difference that remains unresolved between our findings and those of Kuiken et al. is that we did not observe lethargy, skin rash, or respiratory distress in cynomolgus macaques (or rhesus or AGMs) infected with the Urbani strain of SARS-CoV. Kuiken et al. (2003) infected cynomolgus monkeys by administration of a Hong Kong SARS-CoV strain into the nose, trachea, and conjunctiva, while our studies were done with the Urbani strain administered into the nose and trachea. Possible reasons that could account for the differences in our findings and those reported by Kuiken et al. (2003) in cynomolgus monkeys are differences in the strains of SARS-CoV used and differences in the subspecies of monkeys in the two studies. Both strains of SARS-CoV were isolated from fatal human cases and subsequently underwent a similar number of passages in Vero cells. However, it is possible that the strain used in the studies of Kuiken et al. is more virulent for cynomolgus monkeys; this question can be resolved by evaluating both strains in parallel.",

Infection of macrophages by FIPV is believed to be important in the pathogenesis of accelerated disease. SARS-CoV primarily infects epithelial cells in the lungs of AGMs but there is evidence of infection in some macrophages as well that warrants further study. However, the lack of clinical illness and active viral replication on challenge of AGMs is reassuring. We followed the AGMs for 2 months after challenge and saw no evidence of enhanced disease and no evidence of virus replication in the lungs, liver, kidneys, spleen, or intestines at necropsy 2 months following challenge. These observations are consistent with our findings in mice and hamsters, where primary infection with SARS-CoV confers resistance to reinfection and we have not detected evidence of enhanced disease upon re-exposure to SARS-CoV (Roberts et al., 2004, Subbarao et al., 2004).",

Serologic data from our study confirm that non-human primates will be useful for vaccine immunogenicity studies (Gao et al., 2003) and our virologic data and histopathologic findings indicate that AGMs can be used for vaccine efficacy studies (Bukreyev et al., 2004). SARS-CoV titers in lung tissue homogenates were high in one AGM and moderately high in the other at day 2 but were significantly lower in both animals sampled on day 4. An early peak of viral replication, seen in the respiratory tract of AGMs, has also been reported in mice (Subbarao et al., 2004), ferrets, and cats (Martina et al., 2003). It is not entirely clear how these kinetics compare with those in humans because the only report of viral load in respiratory secretions of SARS patients was based on samples from subjects who were treated with steroids and ribavirin (Peiris et al., 2003). AGMs support replication of SARS-CoV, with associated evidence of pneumonitis for at least 2 days but both viral infection and pneumonitis are patchy and not as consistent as the corresponding findings in experimentally infected mice and hamsters (Roberts et al., 2004, Subbarao et al., 2004). The animal-to-animal variability, rapid clearance of virus from the lungs, and rapid resolution of pneumonitis in AGMs are considerations that preclude this species from being the ideal model for the evaluation of the efficacy of vaccines against viral challenge.",
