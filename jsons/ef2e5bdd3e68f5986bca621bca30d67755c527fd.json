Detailed analyses of the complete genomes of different PEDV strains are essential to understand the relationships among re-emerging and historic strains worldwide. Here, we analysed the complete genomes of 409 strains from different countries, which were classified into five subgroup strains (i.e., GI-a, GI-b, GII-a, GII-b, and GII-c). Phylogenetic study of different genes in the PEDV strains revealed that the newly discovered subgroup GII-c exhibited inconsistent topologies between the spike gene and other genes. Furthermore, recombination analysis indicated that GII-c viruses evolved from a recombinant virus that acquired the 5\u2032 part of the spike gene from the GI-a subgroup and the remaining genomic regions from the GII-a subgroup. Molecular clock analysis showed that divergence of the GII-c subgroup spike gene occurred in April 2010, suggesting that the subgroup originated from recombination events before the PEDV re-emergence outbreaks. Interestingly, Ascaris suum, a large roundworm occurring in pigs, was found to be an unusual PEDV host, providing potential support for cross-host transmission. This study has significant implications for understanding ongoing global PEDV outbreaks and will guide future efforts to develop effective preventative measures against PEDV.",

Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), which is the causative agent of PED, belongs to the genus Alphacoronavirus within the family Coronaviridae and is an enveloped single-stranded positivesense RNA virus (Woo et al., 2012) . The PEDV genome consists of seven open reading frames (ORFs) organized in the order ORF1a, ORF1b, spike (S) glycoprotein gene, ORF3 hypothetical protein gene, envelope (E) gene, membrane (M) gene, and nucleocapsid (N) gene . Among the proteins encoded by the ORFs, the S glycoprotein is located on the envelope of the virus in the large surface projections of the virion and plays an important role in the attachment of viral particles to host cell receptors (Lee, Park, Kim, & Lee, 2010) . Thus, the S gene is considered important for understanding the genetic relatedness and epidemiological status of PEDV field isolates, as well as for advancing vaccine development (Chen, Liu, Lang, et al., 2013) .",

With the emergence of new PEDV strains, however, serious disease epidemics have been observed in China since October 2010 (Sun et al., 2012) . Beyond China, the disease has rapidly spread to more than 38 states in the USA following its first outbreak in May 2013, affecting more than 4,000 farms accounting for more than 7 million piglets (Cima, 2014) . Japan, Canada, Mexico, and Colombia have also experienced successive outbreaks, with considerable economic losses to the global pig industry (Lara-Romero et al., 2018; Ojkic et al., 2015; Takahashi, Okada, & Ohshima, 1983; Valko et al., 2017) .",

Strikingly, the phylogeny of the S gene suggested an entirely different evolutionary history for the GII-c subgroup compared to the other subgroups (Figure 3c ). All GII-c subgroup strains showed inconsistent topology in the S gene phylogenetic tree, differing from the ORF1ab gene phylogenetic tree. This inconsistent topology, in which outlier sequences were found between two well-defined subgroups in a phylogenetic tree, was attributed to (95%-99% genetic identity to the ORF1ab and ORF3-E-M-N genes). In contrast, the genetic identity between the S gene sequences of these viruses was only 85% and showed strong similarity with virulent CV777 (95% gene identity). In the S gene phylogeny, virulent DR13 did not cluster with KUPE21 but instead with virulent CV777, suggesting that the PEDV S gene was subjected to relatively frequent recombination, even between divergent subgroups (Figure 3c and Supporting information Figure S2a ). Moreover, the Italy/7239/2009 PEDV strain Intragenogroup recombination provides a mechanism for amalgamation among these distinct subgroups and increases the genetic repertoire of co-circulating PEDV strains.",

To determine the significant S protein sequences among the five different PEDV subgroups, meta-CATS analysis was performed for spike protein sequences of all 409 PEDV strains. We identified 257 amino acid positions with significant variation among the isolates from the five subgroups (Supporting information Table S2 ). As shown in Figure 4 , the GII genogroup contained 11 distinct patterns of aa mutations (I116T, I356T, E365Q, T549S, G594S, N724S, A959V, S1044A, G1173D, S1232R, and R1298Q), distinguishing it from isolates in the GI genogroup. Although the GII-c subgroup S genes shared some aa substitutions with the GI-a and GII-a subgroups (two parents of recombination), they also exhibited three unique patterns (L76, A/S92, and H/T113), which clearly distinguished these isolates from those in the other subgroups, suggesting that the GII-c subgroup S gene evolved gradually through antigenic drift.",

Four neutralizing epitopes (499-638, 748-755, 764-771 , and 1,368-1,374 amino acids) have also been identified in the PEDV S protein (Chang et al., 2002) . To explore whether the GII genogroup acquired substitutions in neutralizing epitopes characteristic of the GI genogroup, we mapped the significantly different positions to the equivalent positions in representative sequences (Figure 4) . Results identified seven substitutions in the neutralizing epitopes of the S protein in the GII genogroup (L521H, S523G, V527I, T549S, G594S, A605E, and L612F), which may explain why traditional inactivated vaccines and attenuated vaccines against the GI genogroup cannot effectively protect piglets threatened by a pandemic strain from the GII genogroup.",

Our genetic analyses showed that the PEDV strains could be categorized into two groups, namely, GI (classical) and GII (variant) . We also discovered a new subgroup (GII-c) with novel genetic, molecular, and phylogenic characteristics. The GII-c subgroup evolved from a recombination event between the GI-a and GII-a subgroups, and we further found recombination in two relatively early strains: virulent DR13 and Italy/7239/2009. These recombination events occurred prior to the re-emergence of PEDV in 2010. Additionally, to explore the potential link between S protein amino acid sequence variations and recombination, we performed a series of comparative analyses of the PEDV S protein sequences. We found 10 positions that were localized in a well-known neutralizing epitope and revealed several unique amino acids that could easily distinguish the different subgroups.",

Since 2010, identification and sequencing analyses have shown that PEDV strain variants are highly prevalent worldwide. These prevalent variants, which have led to huge economic losses (Wang et al., 2016a), were mostly located within the GII genogroup. The GII-a subgroup included strains from the USA as well as from countries that reported US-like PEDVs (e.g., AH2012, HuB1-2017, and HuB7-2017) (Figure 1a). In contrast, the GII-b subgroup predominantly consisted of strains from China, South Korea, and Thailand (AJ1102 and CH/ SD2014) (Supporting informationFigure S1a). The phylogenetic tree further indicated a new GII subgroup (GII-c), which consisted of S-INDEL strains from America (e.g., OH851) and Europe (e.g., GER/ L00862/2014) with high degrees of sequence similarity to the ZL29 strain from China (this study, Supporting informationFigure S1b), suggesting that S-INDEL strains from Europe may have originated from a common ancestor with strain ZL29.",

This analysis confirmed the chimeric nature of the GII-c subgroup. Furthermore, a statistically significant signal for phylogenetic incongruence in the GII-c subgroup defined two recombinant sources of the PEDV genome: that is, (i) positions 1 to 20,551 and 21,551 to the end from the GII-a subgroup, and (ii) positions 20,551 to 21,551 from the GI-a subgroup. Collectively, these phylogenies showed that the GII-c subgroup evolved from a recombination event, with the 5\u2032 part of the S gene acquired from GI-a and the remaining genomic regions acquired from GII-a (Figure 2a). Molecular clock data analysis indicated that the GII-c subgroup S gene likely originated in April 2010 (Figure 2b). As the re-emergence of PEDV in China was reported in October 2010, the recombination event of the ancestral virus strain in the GII-c subgroup appears to have transpired before the PEDV re-emerging outbreaks.",
