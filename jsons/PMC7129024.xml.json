Although usually a self-limited viral disease, it remains a source of significant morbidity in the community. Rhinovirus is associated also with asthma/wheezing and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations, as well as several complications, such as acute otitis media, sinusitis, bronchitis and, in some cases, lower respiratory tract diseases. Pre-school children seem to be the main reservoir [2], as approximately six rhinovirus infections are observed per year and per child [3]. There are more than 150 different rhinovirus types with almost no cross-protection, which explains the frequency of rhinovirus infections and the absence of an effective vaccine or antiviral treatment. Only preventive measures are currently effective against these highly prevalent viruses and understanding their mode of transmission is important to reduce the number of infected patients.",

The required infecting virus dose is below one median tissue culture infectious dose/mL (TCID50) [8], [10]. Three possible transmission routes have been described: via aerosols of respiratory droplets, direct contact by hands, or indirect contact with environmental objects (fomites).",

As rhinovirus transmission depends on the concentration of virus in secretions [4], this supports expert opinion that aerosol or oral transmission is a rare event [12], [13], [14]. Direct contact appears to play a major role in transmission. Rhinoviruses have been shown to transiently survive on human skin [4], [6], [13], [15], leading to the hypothesis that hand-related transmission is the main transmission mechanism [6], [13], [16]. Although less frequently than on skin [13], [17], [18], rhinovirus has been shown to survive on fomites. In an experimental study, 50% of volunteers who touched their nasal mucosa or conjunctiva after handling a contaminated fomite developed infection [15]. However, many authors consider that indirect transmission is unlikely because of the important loss of infectivity during the process [17], [19], [20]. Our study was designed to test rhinovirus stability on fingers under experimental conditions, which aimed to reproduce natural conditions as far as possible.",

RV-B14 stock (1 \u00d7 10e8 TCID50/mL) was diluted with respiratory mucus to obtain three different concentrations: 1 \u00d7 10e5 TCID50/mL (high concentration (HC)); 1 \u00d7 10e4 TCID50/mL (average concentration (AC)); and 1 \u00d7 10e2 TCID50/mL (low concentration (LC)). Each HC and AC droplet contained 1.1 \u00d7 10e5 and 2.8 \u00d7 10e4 viral RNA copies (5.5 \u00d7 10e7 and 1.4 \u00d7 10e7 copies/mL), respectively. LC droplet viral copies were below the limit of detection by real-time RT-PCR assay, but they were expected to represent 200 viral copies given their equivalence to 100 dilutions of the AC. HC represents the average viral load of paediatric nasopharyngeal swabs in our laboratory, whereas LC corresponds to the average measured adult concentration. These values also correlate with epidemiological findings in the literature for paediatric and adult patients [6], [13], [17], [21]. Respiratory mucus was obtained by mixing clinical samples sent for routine testing that were RT-PCR and cell culture negative for the usual human respiratory viruses (influenza virus A/B, human metapneumovirus, coronavirus 229E/HKU1/OC43/NL63, respiratory syncytial virus A/B, picornavirus and parainfluenza virus 1/2/3). A further 20 min of ultraviolet radiation ensured inactivation of putative undetected viruses. To guarantee optimal growth, only mucus with a pH between 6.5 and 7 was retained.",

Each contaminated finger was kept untouched for a defined period of time at room temperature before testing for the presence of infectious rhinovirus. Participants' fingers were then immersed in wells (Becton Dickinson and Co., Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) containing 1 mL of McCoy's 5A medium (1 \u00d7) with 2% serum (Gibco, New York, NY, USA) for 60 seconds. Then, 400 \u03bcL of this eluate was used to immediately inoculate HeLaOH cells. This represents an additional 2.5-fold dilution of the viral load present in droplets before inoculation onto cell cultures (4.4 \u00d7 10e4 viral copies for HC, 1.1 \u00d7 10e4 viral copies for AC, and <100 copies for LC). After 1 h of adsorption at 33\u00b0C, 1 mL of McCoy's 5A medium (1 \u00d7) with 2% serum (Gibco) was added and cells were incubated in 5% CO2 at 33\u00b0C for 7 days. For each 24-well plate, a negative control as well as a mock-infected control finger was included. The cytopathic effect was read daily until day 7. Cells were collected after 7 days and submitted to an immunofluorescence assay.",

This correlates well with D'Alessio et al. who found that the secondary attack rate was related to the viral concentration in the nose [4]. Inoculum seems to be a restrictive factor for transmission, with infectiousness rapidly dropping below a given concentration. As infected children appear to have a higher viral load than adults, this may explain why children are considered to be the main transmission vector. The fact that the viral load in LC droplets was below the level of detection explains why the virus could not be recovered at these concentrations, except in one case without a passage on fingers. LC droplets correspond to the viral concentration recovered in rhinovirus-infected adults and this suggests that transmission via adults occurs rarely. A recent study investigating the transmission of cold-like illnesses between siblings showed that younger children tended to become infected first in most cases. However, the secondary attack rate was greater for older siblings, probably because of a higher viral load in younger siblings' secretions. As younger children tend also to touch nasal secretions directly with their fingers, it is probable that this enhances transmission. The viral load in the mucus of more than 1000 rhinovirus-infected children below 1 year of age was 5.79 \u00d7 10e6 TCID50/mL, which is 10 to 100 times higher than our HC of 1 \u00d7 10e5 (Regamey et al., private communication). It is very probable that the difference in virus survival between adults and children is even higher than in our results.",

We have previously shown that influenza virus survival on fingers was not related to virus concentration in a study using a similar methodology to the present experiments [22]. Survival of influenza virus on fingers declined rapidly, with less than 15% of the fingers remaining positive after 30 min [22]. The influenza envelope, which is known to be a determinant factor decreasing virus survival, may explain why survival was shorter and affected by droplet disruption, which was not the case for rhinovirus [22]. In a similar study, RV-14 in 10-\u03bcL droplets at 2.9 \u00d7 10e4 to 1.4 \u00d7 10e5 TCID50/mL survived for 1 h on almost 40% of fingers [24]. The fact that virus survival was lower compared with our results, despite the use of bigger droplets and higher viral concentrations, may be explained by the fact that our volunteers did not wash their hands or use an alcohol-based hand rub before experiments as hand rubbing has been shown to decrease virus survival even several hours after use [25]. The fact that disinfecting hands or objects with an iodine or alcohol-based solution reduces the secondary illness rate of rhinovirus infections emphasizes also the importance of hand-related transmission [8], [15], [26].",
