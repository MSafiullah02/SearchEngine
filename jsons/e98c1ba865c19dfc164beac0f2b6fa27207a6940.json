However, other techniques, which present different advantages, can also be used for this purpose. In this paper, we focus on high angle annular dark field (HAADF) in TEM and scanning TEM (STEM) in scanning electron microscopy (SEM) imaging modes. The mentioned techniques will be first described, then compared to more conventional ones for the measurement of carbides size distribution in two FeCV and FeCVNb model alloys. This comparative study shows that STEM in SEM, a technique much easier to undertake compared to TEM, is perfectly adapted for size distribution measurements of second phase particles, with sizes ranging between 5 and 200 nm in these systems.",

In that case, the matrix is simply orientated in a specific crystallographic direction (e.g. 100 ferrite zone axes), and usual dark-field imaging allows to reveal each of the three variants precipitated in the observed area (see for example Perrard et al. (2006) in the case of NbC precipitation in low carbon steels).

            "text": "Recently, new TEM approaches have emerged for the quantitative analysis of precipitation in metal alloys: energyfiltered TEM (EFTEM) and high angle annular dark field (HAADF). These techniques, when applicable, present the advantage to image correctly the precipitates even when no OR exists with respect to the matrix. EFTEM allows second phases to be imaged in thin foils owing to their difference in chemistry with the matrix. Electrons of the primary beam that have experienced an inelastic scattering caused by a given atomic specie only present in the precipitates can be used to produce an elementary map imaging the particles of interest (Hofer et al. 1996; Craven et al. 2000; Rainforth et al. 2002; Beres et al. 2004; Courtois et al. 2006; Mackenzie et al. 2006 ) with a very good spatial resolution (i.e. near 1 nm Mackenzie et al. (2006) ). HAADF in TEM is another imaging method allowing nanometric particles or precipitates to be easily imaged within thin foils and/or when collected on a supporting film (such as extraction replicas in the case of precipitates). In this method, the intensity is roughly proportional to Z 2 (where Z is the atomic number), and excellent contrast is obtained in the case of nanometric particles deposited on holey carbon grids (Treacy & Rice 1989) , or carbon or alumina extraction replicas, respectively (Wilson & Craven 2003; Courtois et al. 2006) . From a practical point of view, extraction replicas represent a very attractive method, when applicable to precipitation problems (see Bradley (1965) and references therein for a general presentation of the replica techniques). After a slight pre-etching, the surface of the material is covered by a nanometric film, and the matrix is further selectively dissolved, allowing precipitates to be retained and observed on the deposited film. In the case of steels, this preparation offers two great advantages: (i) to get rid of the undesirable magnetic influence of the iron matrix during TEM work; and (ii) to allow very large numbers of particles to be measured on a single replica.",

This state (called fully precipitated state [FPS]), was chosen as the starting point for a series of isothermal heat treatments in austenite.

However, a motivation of this study is to check whether such measurements can also be efficiently performed with a SEM, because the latter instrument is more accessible and easier to use especially for the industry. Figure 7 (b) shows a micrograph of the same zone as previously described, obtained in a SEM in SE mode. Particles are clearly discernable, but again the contrast obtained is not high enough for allowing an automatic image analysis. Note that the HAADF image seems to be more contrasted because of the larger dynamic of the 16 bits recorded images which is considerably reduced in a 8 bits grey level display.",

Figure 8(a,b) compares HAADF-TEM and STEM-SEM micrographs of extraction replica from the FeCVNb alloy austenitized at 1200 \u2022 C for 5 days. The particles observed in this state are significantly larger and 'heavier' (owing to the presence of niobium) than the particles showed in Fig. 7 . Once again, both imaging techniques show the same size of particles, but there are now obvious differences in their contrast. According to relation 1, the HAADF intensity is a monotone function of the composition and the thickness of the particles; hence, if the particles have the same chemical composition, the bigger they are, the whiter they appear. In SEM, the contrast of the biggest particles is here different: they appear dark in the centre. This inversion of contrast is partly due to the energy of the incident beam: in TEM, incident electrons have a sufficient energy (200 kV) to pass across the largest particles without any significant losses which would decrease the scattered intensity collected by the annular detector, whereas 30 kV electrons in the SEM experience efficient back-scattering or other inelastic processes for larger particles which decrease the collectable STEM signal compared to thinner particles. Furthermore, other parameters, such as the detector geometry and the range of collection angles, might also affect the STEM contrast in the SEM. ",

Figure 9 shows the particle size distributions of four different states of the FeCV alloy. To make the comparison easier between results obtained in STEM and in TEM, normalized densities of distribution have been represented. The results obtained with both techniques are in good agreement. Even when the shape of the distribution is slightly different, the maximum of the density appears for the same radius range. Furthermore, the mean radius values calculated from the particle size distributions obtained with both techniques are very similar, and the maximal difference observed in the case of the FeCV alloy is less than 20%. Observations performed on the same zone ( Fig. 8 ; STEM in SEM and HAADF in TEM) lead to a difference of 4% in mean radius. As the measurements were done on different replicas and that the number of particles observed is not always the same, we can conclude that both techniques give the same result.",

As a general trend, SEM and TEM imaging techniques on both bulk samples and carbon extraction replica can give comparable particle size measurements, but time considerations reduce the interest of observations on bulk samples (SE in SEM and CTEM or HAADF on thin foils), because it may be extremely tedious to collect sufficiently large number of data in order to obtain representative results. 2. Particles size distributions can be perfectly determined in SEM when extraction replicas are feasible. 3. Observations on carbon replica, both in HAADF imaging technique and STEM mode in SEM, allow large populations of particles to be measured in a semi-automatic way owing to the high contrast of micrographs.",
