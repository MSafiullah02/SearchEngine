We contrast the\nresultant behaviours (in terms of bifurcations and the coexistence of attractors) with those\nobserved under periodic forcing. In doing so, we aim to get better insights about the\ncombined role of external versus internal factors that they play in bringing about the\nseasonality seen in the incidences of infectious diseases. As hinted in the beginning of\nthis paragraph, the models considered here vary in internal feedbacks on disease dynamics in\nterms of the effect of immune response in regulating the build-up of susceptibles during\ninter-epidemic periods necessary for fuelling next outbreaks. With quasiperiodic modulation,\nwe capture the impact of the external feedback that may vary over time in its strength\n(i.e., amplitude) and/or the onset of the peak in the transmission term. The subsequent\nsections are organized as follows. In Section II, we\ndescribe a set of epidemic models with the temporally forced transmission rate. In the\nsection, we also define the measures used to characterize SNA dynamics. In Section III, we discuss the results on the dynamics of the\nepidemics models with quasiperiodic modulation in the transmission rate vis-a-vis those\nobtained with periodic modulation. This is followed in Section IV by discussing the implications of our results.",

Additionally, we study the effect of human demographics (i.e., the\nbirth and death rates) into the model dynamics. In our study, the newborns join the\nsusceptible compartment, which means we do not consider vertical (i.e., mother to child)\ntransmission, and the per capita births and deaths are taken to be the same to keep the\npopulation size constant, with the total host density scaled to 1. \u2022SIR modelThe SIR model consists of individuals of the susceptible, infective, and recovered\nclasses. Susceptibles transition their state to become infectives who in turn move\nto the recovered class.

Such situations are modelled using the\nSIRS model given by5\nS\u02d9=\u03bc\u2212\u03b2SI\u2212\u03bcS+\u03baR,I\u02d9=\u03b2SI\u2212\u03b7I\u2212\u03bcI,R\u02d9=\u03b7I\u2212(\u03ba+\u03bc)R,(2)where the parameters \u03b2,\u03bc,\u03b7 have the same\nmeaning as in the SIR model while \u03ba is the rate at which the\nrecovered individuals become susceptible again. If \u03ba\u21920 (i.e., recovered\nindividuals do not become susceptible again), then the SIRS reduces to the SIR\nmodel.\u2022SEIR modelNewly infected individuals of a population before they start infecting others may\nstay in an exposed stage. Such transmission process is studied using the SEIR model,\nand the model dynamics are given by the following equations: S\u02d9=\u03bc\u2212\u03b2SI\u2212\u03bcS,E\u02d9=\u03b2SI\u2212\u03c3E\u2212\u03bcE,I\u02d9=\u03c3E\u2212\u03b7I\u2212\u03bcI,R\u02d9=\u03b7I\u2212\u03bcR,(3)where the parameters \u03b2,\u03bc,\u03b7 have the same\nmeaning as in SIR model, while \u03c3 is the rate at which the exposed\nindividuals join the infective class.

On increasing the values\nof \u03b4, the dynamics changes from torus to chaos via a finite period\ndoubling route.15 Strange non-chaotic\nattractors may be observed at the transition boundary between torus and chaos. A typical\nfeature of SNA is that the dynamics are free from sensitive dependence on initial\nconditions: two trajectories started with slightly different initial conditions\nsynchronize on the SNA31 but have\nnon-smooth or fractal geometry. This implies that asymptotically predictable pattern of\nepidemic outbreaks is possible under quasiperiodic forcing. This is because a SNA\ntrajectory has both contracting and expanding subsets of the attractor and for a\nsufficiently long trajectory the contracting set dominates, rendering the dynamics free\nfrom sensitive dependence on initial conditions. The SNAs are observed at the transition\nboundary of chaotic and regular motions as one varies \u03b4, see the green\nregions in the two dimensional parameter space shown in Fig. 2. Examples of the typical bifurcation diagram as a function of\n\u03b4 for different values of \u03f5 are shown in Figs. 5(a) and 5(b), both containing the\nforward (black dots) and backward (red dots) bifurcation plots. Although the bifurcation\ndiagrams for the quasiperiodic modulation case are shown, it is important to note that the\ndynamics occurs on a quasiperiodic torus and the standard bifurcation theory does not\napply: n\u2013branch orbits are converted to Tn,\netc. The corresponding Lyapunov exponent spectra are shown in Figs. 5(c) and 5(d). Orbits are\ndistinguished from each other based on the Lyapunov exponents (see Section II C) and the phase sensitivity parameter described in\nEq. (5). Typical orbits in the torus, SNA,\nand chaotic regimes are shown in Figs. 6(a)\u20136(c),\ntheir corresponding phase sensitivity parameters in Figs. 6(d)\u20136(f), while the distribution of finite time largest Lyapunov exponents, P(\u03bb1,t) with\nt = 1000, are shown in Figs. 6(g)\u20136(i).",

A typical example for \u03b4=0.277 is shown in Fig. 7: the largest nonzero Lyapunov exponent in Fig. 7(a) and mean\u2013square displacement in Fig. 7(b). Distinct clusters of the largest nonzero Lyapunov\nexponents or the \u27e8r2\u27e9 indicate the coexistence\nof distinct attractors. Now that we know a critical value of \u03f5 after which only one attractor survives\nfor a given \u03b4, we choose a value of \u03f5<\u03f5c for which it\nis expected to see multistability as we increase \u03b4 from zero. We stop at\na value of \u03b4 at which an SNA is likely to be observed and scan for the\nother coexisting attractors and their relative basin sizes. We find that typically an SNA\noccupies the whole basin: Fig. 8(a) shows the SNA at \u03b4=0.2471,\u03f5=0.01, Fig. 8(b) its phase sensitivity parameter, and Fig. 8(c) shows its basin.",
