Other smaller retrospective studies, comprising different types of haploidentical transplant platforms, have consistently found a higher risk of IFI after haploidentical/MMRD transplant relative to MRD Allo-SCT. 8, 9 Antifungal prophylaxis was very heterogeneous in these studies ranging from fluconazole only to anti-mold-active agents. All these reports support the urgent need for a more stringent PAP after haploidentical transplant in order to reduce the occurrence of IFI and of IFI-related mortality that can be as high as 33%. 9 In addition, epidemiologic studies on fungal infection and prophylaxis in the last years have shown a shift from Candida (that remains the second major cause, comprising albicans and non-albicans) to Aspergillus species as the most frequent agents responsible for IFI after Allo-SCT. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] Given this background, the ECIL-5 11 and GITMO 12 recommended to employ anti-mold prophylaxis for patients at higher risk of IFI based on donor type (haploidentical or cord blood), timing after transplant (pre-or post-engraftment phase), and occurrence of GVHD. Itraconazole, voriconazole, and posaconazole received a BI-BII level of recommendations by the last version of ECIL recommendation. 13 No data are available either to recommend or to contraindicate echinocandin as PAP. our Institution. The aim of this study was to analyze the efficacy of caspofungin as PAP both in terms of IFI incidence in the first 100 days after Allo-SCT and in terms of patients' long-term outcome.",

            "text": ",31 consistently proposed fluconazole as PAP for low-/standard-risk transplant and an anti-mold agent of choice between posaconazole, voriconazole, anditraconazole for subjects at high risk. Caspofungin received a C level of recommendation by the Australian guidelines and a lack of data by ECIL-5 11 and by the last ECIL recommendations.13 In this context, our study is the first report in adults providing evidence for efficacy of caspofungin at preventing IFI in Haplo-SCT with PT-CY that are at high risk of mold infections. One recent study in pediatric patients has compared amphotericin B (L-AmB) with caspofungin as PAP after Allo-SCT.32 In this study, caspofungin resulted in an excellent protection against IFI with only 1 out of 60 patients developing PP-IFI. Another important observation of this study, besides similar efficacy of the two compounds, was the superior safety profile of caspofungin relative to L-AmB. Consistently, we did not observe either kidney of liver toxicity and interaction with cyclosporine was very low, therefore avoiding the need for frequent cyclosporine dose adjustment as expected with fluconazole (data not shown). Therefore relative to other available antifungal agents, caspofungin provides both some advantages and disadvantages: It is probably more effective than fluconazole against mold infections and has less interactions with other drugs, but it is more expensive; relative to posaconazole and voriconazole, it is not clear whether it provides the same level of protection against mold infections, but it is less expensive and has a safer profile in terms of organ toxicity and drug interactions.Risk factors for developing IFI in patients receiving haploidentical-SCT are not very well known. Sun et al23 in the GIAC platform identified platelet engraftment time (>17 days), grade III-IV acute GVHD, and high-risk underlying disease as the most important risk factors for IFI. In our study, we have found by univariate analysis a direct correlation between risk of IFI and increasing number of days of neutropenia, but this was not confirmed by multivariate analysis where advanced DRI came out as the only variable affecting the probability of developing IFI. However, this result should be read with caution due to the relative low number of PP-IFI (n = 8) events in our cohort. Of course, this retrospective study is affected by several limitations. The fact that most patients received RIC or NMA transplant may have resulted in reduced incidence of PP-IFI. Of note, we did not observe any increased incidence of PP-IFI in the subgroup receiving MAC transplant (data not shown). Moreover, we restricted our analysis only to the first 100 days after transplant that may have induced us to lose a small part of events. We decided to do so because many factors other than antifungal prophylaxis, such as acute and chronic GVHD, are known to play a predominant role in the occurrence of IFI after day +100. 7 Moreover, recent evidences such as the ones from GITMO showed that most PP-IFI (76%) occurred in the first 100 days after allo-SCT. Another limitation of this study concerns the comparison with itraconazole prophylaxis. Unfortunately, even if we observed a trend for reduced PP-IFI in the cohort receiving caspofungin, no definitive conclusion can be taken probably because of the different characteristics of the 2 F I G U R E 2 Outcome of patients receiving haploidentical stem cell transplantation (Haplo-SCT) with posttransplant cyclophosphamide (PT-Cy) and caspofungin as primary antifungal prophylaxis: (A) Kaplan-Meier estimate of 3-year overall survival; (B) 1-year cumulative incidence of non-relapse mortality; (C) 6-month cumulative incidence of grade 2-4 acute GVHD; and (D) 2-year cumulative incidence of moderate-severe chronic GVHD TA B L E 3 Characteristics of patients developing pulmonary infection during the first 100 days after allo-SCT Gender/ Age Radiological characteristics of the lung Time from allo-SCT BAL (yes/no), result EORTC classification of IFI Therapy Outcome Day 0-40 M/70 Areas of consolidation and interstitial thickening of the medium lobe of the right lung with pleural effusion",
