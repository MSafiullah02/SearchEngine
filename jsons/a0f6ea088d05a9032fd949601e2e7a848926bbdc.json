Worry about the outbreak and closely following media coverage were consistent predictors of health-protective behaviours (both over the previous month, and intended behaviours in the case of a widespread outbreak) as well as vaccination intentions. Health-behaviour engagement over the previous month was lower in some demographic groups, including males and younger individuals (18-29 age group). These was a substantial mismatch between respondents' expected symptoms of infection and emerging evidence that a meaningful proportion of people who contract the novel coronavirus will experience asymptomatic infection (i.e., they will not experience symptoms associated with COVID-19). Only 0.3% of those in the current study believed that they personally would not experience any symptoms if they were infected. Uncertainty and misconceptions about COVID-19 were common, including one third of respondents who reported being unsure whether people are likely have natural or existing immunity. There was also uncertainty around whether specific home remedies (e.g., vitamins, saline rinses) would offer protection, whether the virus could spread via the airborne route, and whether the virus was human made and deliberately released. Such misconceptions are likely to cause concern for members of the public. These results point to areas of uncertainty that could be usefully targeted by public education campaigns, as well as psychological and demographic factors associated with .

For example, higher perceived likelihood and severity of influenza A/H1N1 (swine flu), influenza H5N1 (bird flu), and SARS were associated with increased heath-protective behaviours (e.g. handwashing) in general population samples (Lau, Kim, Tsui, & Griffiths, 2007; Rubin, Amlot, Page, & Wessely, 2009; Tang & Wong, 2003) . In addition, health-protective behaviours during a pandemic are associated with more accurate knowledge about the virus (Petrie et al., 2016) and the perception that these behaviours will be effective in reducing the risk of infection, as well as heightened anxiety, and trust in information provided by authorities (Bish & Michie, 2010) .",

Anxiety and risk perceptions may be influenced by media coverage and exposure to misinformation about the emerging health threat of COVID-19. Even with accurate media reporting -a particular challenge in a changing situation in which scientific information about the virus is emerging and being disseminated in real-time -the amount, framing, tone, sources, and perceived trustworthiness of media coverage can affect public risk perceptions (Paek & Hove, 2017) . Analysis of media coverage during the Influenza A/H1N1 (swine flu) pandemic shows a large volume of news stories that tended to present conflicting and threatening information, while neglecting coverage of self-protective behaviours (Klemm, Das, & Hartmann, 2016) . Even subtly misleading information, for example through the use of inaccurate images or misleading headlines, can bias readers' interpretation of and memory for the information (Ecker, Lewandowsky, Chang, & Pillai, 2014) . In addition to a large volume of media coverage, misinformation and conspiracy theories regarding COVID-19 are widespread and still emerging and evolving at the time of writing (Wikipedia, 2020; World Health Organization, 2020a) . Such misinformation can have lasting impacts, including reduced engagement .

While it was promising to see that 72% sourced information from official and government websites, mainstream news media was most popular (85%), and social media (68%) was also high. The high usage of news media as sources of information is concerning given the potential for alarming, sensationalist portrayals of the pandemic (Klemm et al., 2016) . In addition, myths, rumours and misinformation can quickly spread online, particularly via social media. People are more likely to spread false news stories and misinformation, and these false stories spread more widely, and more quickly, than true stories (Vosoughi, Roy, & Aral, 2018) . This might have been one of the reasons why there were several uncertainties around COVID-19, with a significant minority reporting being 'unsure' whether people have natural immunity to it, whether specific home remedies (garlic, vitamins, rinsing noses with saline) help protect against coronavirus. It may also explain some uncertainty around whether packages and letters from China spread the virus, and whether the virus was human made and deliberately released; almost one third of respondents indicated feeling 'unsure' whether this was true or not. In addition, uncertainty and rapidly changing information may have contributed to increased worry about the virus (Han, Moser, & Klein, 2006) .

The effect of media exposure is likely to be related to the provision of important health information about the pandemic. Although media exposure early in the outbreak appears to have facilitated healthprotective behaviours, media fatigue -where people become desensitised to ongoing messagingmay reduce this effect as the pandemic continues (Collinson, Khan, & Heffernan, 2015) .

Participants were recruited online, primarily through Facebook, and therefore may not be representative of the general population. Although we recruited a range of education levels, cultural backgrounds, age ranges, and gender, three quarters were female, and Caucasian, 43% were from NSW, and 62% were younger than 50 years of age, and results may not generalise to the broader population. To maximise convenience sampling, we used solely self-report measures, which may lead to biased effects. While the results of the regression analyses provide interesting starting points to identify the demographic and risk variables that predict actual and anticipated health behaviours, as well as vaccine intentions, they cannot establish causality, and must be interpreted with caution. Given the large sample, the relationships between some of the significant predictors are likely to be small and may not be clinically meaningful.",
