Their diagnosis of COVID-19 infection was confirmed with a positive result to real-time fluorescence polymerase chain reaction assay for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid, with nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swab specimens.

Ground glass opacity was defined as increased lung attenuation with preservation of bronchial and vascular margins, and consolidation was defined as opacification in which the underlying vasculature was obscured.16,17",

Some investigations,14,16,20 including the current one, have shown some frequently encountered HRCT findings, some of which were similar with other viral pneumonias, including specifically SARS, MERS, and H7N9 pneumonia.18,21,22 In terms of distribution, the lower lobes are preferentially affected, especially the left lower lobe in our study group (34/42 cases in the initial onset stages). Pulmonary lesions were most commonly in the subpleural, peribronchovascular area, or distributed diffusively. In the early stages, single or multiple small ground glass infiltration, consolidation, and interstitial thickening could be seen. As the disease progressed, severe cases had more consolidation and air bronchograms in the relevant lobes. The diffuse lesions, shown as \u201cwhite lungs,\u201d were seen in the most severely affected patients. Fibrous stripes could be seen during the remission stage. The distribution manners, together with the GGOs, are very characteristic and impressive.",

This may be related to the immunopathological basis that the coronaviruses interact with and modify the host intracellular environment during infection for the benefit of quickly replicating. The majority of studies have suggested that a dysregulated/exuberant innate response is the leading contributor to coronavirus-mediated pathology.23 Many cytokines or chemokines are involved in the immune storm after coronavirus infection.24 Although with meticulous treatments, it takes a time for the immune response to build and produce antibodies to suppress virus replication. As a result, it is of great importance to control the progression in the first 2 weeks from illness onset with utmost effort.",

These findings indicate that high fever on initial presentation is a potential risk factor of adverse CT outcomes over a short-term follow-up; however, the limited cases in this study should be noted. Moreover, several initial CT findings, including sum score and max score for opacification severity as well as area of the max lesion in cross-section, were inversely associated with \u0394Sum.
