The global health community has to take action to slow its continued spread and reduce the ever increasing mortality. The action needs to be multipronged requiring financial, legislative, and executive action that will require participation from all segments of the society including the government and the citizens [1, 2].",

These plans mainly addressed the issues of protection of health care professionals, the sudden surge in patient numbers, and patient management with limited resources [3]. The foremost priority for the health community will be preparation of the hospitals and the clinics for the sudden high\u2010volume patient inflow that will require preparing protocols for triaging and segregating patients in the emergency departments so that COVID\u201019 patients do not mix with the \u201cregular\u201d patients and transmit the infection. Prevention of nosocomial infection should be another priority that was a major issue in China [4]. This will require framing of specialized protocols and training of the medical staff and adequate supply of personal protective equipment. Proper availability, utilization, and maintenance of ventilators, as well as simplified protocols for nonexpert physicians should be yet another priority for the health community that can be difficult in the developing world [5]. The physicians treating the patients in all parts of the world also need to keep aware of any recent advancement in therapeutic options. With thousands of health care workers infected with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 and multiple reported deaths of physicians, an important issue remains the development of procedures for a proper protection of health care workers at any level of patient care, not only for management of confirmed infections. Another major area of concern is the availability of diagnostic testing facilities, which are needed in large numbers and at the point of care. Public health experts need to expand testing to all patients who have unexplained acute respiratory distress syndrome or severe pneumonia, and ultimately to patients who have mild symptoms.",
