Especially in China, Prussian carp farming has become an emerging industry in the province of Hubei, Jiangsu, Hunan, Guangdong, Jiangxi, Anhui, Shandong, Sichuan, Guangxi, Liaoning, etc., and has brought great profits in recent years. Annual production was nearly 2.2 million tonnes in 2010 (Ge and Miao, 2011) . However, under intensive culture conditions, serious problems in Prussian carp hatcheries occur due to saprolegniosis caused by zoosporic oomycete fungi. During egg incubation, the oomycetes produce mycelia, which grow and spread from dead to healthy eggs thereby causing major economic losses (Noga, 1993; Cao et al., 2012a) .

In the present study, the naturally occurring pathogen of saprolegniosis-infected Prussian carp eggs was identified as a Saprolegnia australis R. F. Elliott 1968 strain.

This herbal extract can be applied directly to fish hatching pools, and its use will relieve some of the environmental pressures in a fish hatchery. Identification of the Saprolegnia species is complex and sometimes confusing. However, several typical morphological features involving asexual and sexual reproductive organs serve as classic indicators of Saprolegnia (Stueland et al., 2005b) .

Therefore, the ITS region of the SC strain is compared to those of Saprolegnia isolates (Whisler, 1996) .
