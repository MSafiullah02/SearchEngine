Having an emergency plan and access to appropriate obstetric care is recommended.\u2022Before booking, check with the airline or cruise ship regarding any limitations on travel. Some limit travel based on gestational age.\u2022During air travel the cabin is pressurized to 6000 to 8000 feet. This will not affect a fetus in a normal pregnancy, but could cause fetal problems in women with cardiovascular conditions, sickle cell disease, or severe anemia (hemoglobin <8 g/dL).\u2022During air travel, frequent stretching, walking, and isometric exercises are recommended to decrease risk of deep venous thrombosis, which is increased in pregnancy.\u2022Treatment of choice for traveler\u2019s diarrhea is hydration and, if indicated, azithromycin.\u2022Owing to the risk of birth defects, the CDC recommends that pregnant women do not travel to areas where Zika is present. If travel cannot be avoided, avoidance of mosquito bites is extremely important. More information can be found at the CDC Zika website (http://www.cdc.gov/zika/pregnancy/index.html).\u2022Most live virus vaccines are contraindicated during pregnancy except for yellow fever, for which pregnancy is considered a precaution by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices.\u2022Malaria is more serious in pregnant than in nonpregnant women and puts both the mother and the fetus at risk. Malaria chemoprophylaxis is highly encouraged. Chloroquine and mefloquine (depending on the region) are the drugs of choice. Doxycycline and primaquine are contraindicated due to possible effects on the fetus, whereas atovaquone-proguanil lacks available safety data.\n",

Life vests should always be used around water.\u2022Avoidance of mosquito and other bug bites is critical, especially in malaria endemic areas. Repellents with DEET should not be used on infants less than 2 months and after 2 months, only repellents with 30% or less DEET should be used.\u2022Malaria prophylaxis is also recommended for children in malaria endemic areas. Dosing will need to be adjusted based on weight. Doxycycline should not be given to children less than 8 years old because of the risk of teeth staining, and atovaquone-proguanil should not be used in children weighing less than 5 kg.\u2022Rabies is more common in children owing to less fear in approaching animals. If there is exposure to any animal bite, seek medical care immediately. Consider rabies vaccine if planning to spend more than 3 months in endemic area.\n",
