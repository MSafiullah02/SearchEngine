We have been living through the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has been far more significant than the 1957-58 H2N2 influenza pandemic, the 1968 H3N2 influenza pandemic, and the 2009 H1N1pdm09 influenza pandemic.

A high peak that exceeded capacity, specifically the availability of intensive care beds and ventilators, would limit access to appropriate healthcare and result in otherwise preventable deaths. The steps to \u201cflatten the curve\u201d are intended to slow viral transmission in order to delay the onset of enough cases to lower the peak and spread the distribution of cases over time, not specifically to prevent the overall incidence of cases during the pandemic.",

In almost all locales, actions such as canceling elective surgeries and broad implementation of telemedicine have significantly reduced overall healthcare demands. These steps to flatten the curve have been critical in those locales with high numbers of cases and undoubtedly reduced COVID-19-associated mortality. However, by applying these actions in a one-size-fits-all approach to all hospitals in all locales, the impact has been so great that even after meeting the needs for patients with COVID-19, many if not most hospitals and hospital systems are not logistically challenged for beds or ventilators but are severely challenged financially, some to the point of viability. Rather than spare healthcare facilities the adverse impact of COVID-19, our healthcare facilities have had substantial adverse impact resulting directly from actions intended to spare healthcare facilities. We have seen tens and hundreds of thousands of healthcare workers who have been furloughed or laid off. Ambulatory visits have fallen by 50% or more, resulting in untold numbers of patients who have not had the routine or even urgent care that they would have normally accessed. Rather than help our healthcare facilities, government actions are taking a huge toll on the very health and wellbeing of healthcare, and on society itself.",

Compared to the United States, Germany has a lower incidence rate (Fig. 2\n) despite fewer government restrictions on their economy, allowing most factories and offices to remain open (Wall Street Journal, 2020). Countries such as Sweden (Fig. 3\n) have fared comparably to other counties that have imposed strict restrictions even though Sweden chose a very different approach, adjusting how society functions but without an involuntary lockdown of the entire populace and closing most businesses (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2020). Even in regions where lockdowns were implemented, the additive benefits are difficult to quantitate. For example, a preliminary analysis of cases in New York City shows that the incidence reached an inflection point around the date that the state initiated the lockdown (Harris, 2020). Some states in the United States are taking far less draconian measures and have fared better than some states taking extreme restrictions. Florida, for example, did not impose statewide closure of non-essential businesses but left early lockdown decisions to local authorities. It is unknown how much mandatory state-imposed restrictions add to the impact of voluntary actions taken by the citizenry in the face of a pandemic. The voluntary change in behavior resulting from education is a significant factor in pandemic mitigation. At this time, we are not close to understanding the outcome of the pandemic, let alone the complex interactions and impact of individual actions on the outcome.",

COVID-19 is different from influenza in many ways, and the mortality from this first wave of COVID-19 already exceeds the typical annual mortality usually associated with influenza. The medical impact of COVID-19 is different, is part because the epidemiology and spread of a new pathogen through a non-immune population is different from influenza. More striking has been the societal and governmental response to COVID-19 compared to influenza. Why has the response to COVID-19 been so different than for influenza, including the H1N1 influenza pandemic in 2009? It seems that the novelty of a new virus, with a unique name and identity, as opposed to \u201cjust the flu,\u201d has been one factor. Another significant factor has been the attention, and sometimes hysteria, resulting from the heightened presence of social media and also the mainstream media.
