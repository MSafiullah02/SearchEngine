During the Fourth European Conference on Infections in Leukemia (ECIL-4), it was recommended to screen for respiratory viruses in patients with respiratory symptoms. The identification of influenza virus, human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV), and human parainfluenza virus are the priorities. Meanwhile, the identification of human enterovirus, human metapneumovirus (HMPV), human rhinovirus, human coronavirus, and human adenovirus should be accomplished if the above-mentioned tests had negative results or when there is a risk of contagion [5].

This review shows the respiratory viral infections that can be originated to HMPV infection exclusively in pediatric oncology patients. The distribution of HMPV among other viruses in otherwise healthy children and adolescents is reported to be 6\u201340% [8], which is greater than that of the pediatric population with underlying cancer, whose HMPV distribution is 3.3\u201313.5% (as seen in this review). These data should be taken carefully because the combined number of patients in the cancer group was small (n = 3867), and the number of HMPV infections may have been underestimated. Interestingly, in pediatric oncology patients, 2.9\u201310% of the HMPV infections were detected in episodes of ARI; however in children going through febrile episodes, HMPV infection was found in up to 44% [37] and 51% [38] of cases. This difference is probably because HMPV infections could be asymptomatic because about 60% of the fever episodes in neutropenic patients do not show other signs or symptoms [59]. ",

Though the previously described treatment has been proved to be effective, no randomized clinical trials have been performed to support these results. Actually, the treatment with ribavirin and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) had an unfavorable outcome in other cases [35].
