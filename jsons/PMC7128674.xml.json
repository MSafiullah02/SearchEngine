The authors walk us through specific innate immune signaling networks, including how RNA viruses are recognized as nonself to trigger innate immunity through RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs), RIG-I and MDA5, of host cells of infection. They show us where and how innate immune signaling factors and effector genes are targeted for control or direct suppression by Ebola virus, SARS coronavirus, West Nile virus and related flaviviruses, as well as Chikungunya virus, and Middle Eastern respiratory virus, and others. A common theme emerges from this presentation in that disease is linked to viral disruption of host innate immune response programs.",

The unique mode of dynamic MDA5 dsRNA assembly and disassembly allows for RNA length discrimination as a basis of non-self RNA sensing. The dsRNA filament assembly results in organization of the MDA5 CARD domains into a signaling-competent oligomer that in turn stimulate MAVS aggregation and antiviral signal transduction. Though MDA5 activity usually protects the organism from virus infections, these same mechanistic insights are also relevant to the pathogenic actions of disregulated MDA5, as found in several autoimmune and inflammatory diseases.",

Odendall and Kagan [4] present an overview to first compare type 1 and type 3 (now formally called interferon-lambda) interferons in virus infection and immunity. Interferon-lambda biology is then featured in depth to tell us how it signals host defense through production from specific cells types and novel signaling programs, as well as how tissue restriction of the interferon-lambda receptor defines a specific niche for innate immune effector actions of this interferon type.",

The authors first summarize the role of interferon-lambda in HCV infection and immunity. They present an overview of the interferon-lambda genetics in which specific polymorphisms in interferon-lambda genes are linked with the outcome of HCV infection and type-1 interferon-based antiviral therapy. Remarkably, mRNA from the interferon-lambda gene 3 is subject to targeted regulation by specific microRNA (miRNA)s. The authors review the mechanisms by which these miRNAs target interferon-lambda mRNA for post-transcriptional control of gene expression and show us how infection outcome-associated polymorphisms serve to evade miRNA control for likely effector actions that can limit HCV replication. Beyond miRNAs other post-transcriptional control processes of IFN-lambda gene expression are operating to impact innate immune defenses against HCV, thus explaining new concepts in our understanding of how chronic HCV infection develops from initial acute infection.",

While effective therapeutic for HCV infection are now in the clinic, they are incredibly expensive and therefore not available to the broad HCV-infected population nor do these new therapeutics protect from or prevent re-infection. Thus, there remains a huge need for effective HCV vaccine strategies that can confer protection from infection. Such strategies will require means to induce potent therapeutic or ideally a fully protective antibody response directed to the HCV surface glycoproteins, E1 and E2. These proteins problematically harbor hypervariable regions that drift away from inhibitory antibodies, while overall the unique structure of E1 and E2 present hurdles for effective antibody targeting and viral neutralization. Marcotrigiano et al. [6] present a review of the current understanding of E1 and E2 structure, with a focus on dissecting the structural information gained from recent protein crystallization efforts. Consideration is given as to how we can leverage structural information to build effective HCV vaccines.",

There can be little doubt that most influenza A viruses use NS1 to evade host innate responses, but while many explanations for the NS1-mediated antiviral suppression have been described, it is difficult to discern a general mechanistic basis for NS1 interferon antagonist activities. After examining the experimental data and mechanistic conclusions regarding NS1 action, Krug [8] finds that it is impossible to generalize NS1 actions, as they differ on a strain-by-strain basis. Early reliance on laboratory-generated strains may have missed biological activities that are more pronounced in circulating influenza viruses.",
