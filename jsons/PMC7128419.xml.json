ARTIs are classified as acute upper respiratory tract infection (URTI), acute bronchitis, or pneumonia. Diagnosis of ARTI except pneumonia is largely based on clinical signs and symptoms, because viruses, the most commonly causative pathogens of URTI and acute bronchitis, are difficult to detect. However, antibiotics have been prescribed in many patients with URTI or acute bronchitis [2], [3], [4]. Inappropriate prescription of antibiotics promotes antibiotic resistance. Therefore, these viruses should be detected.",

In 14 patients with Influenza virus in the FilmArray RP, six (42.9%) were negative in the influenza antigen test. The sensitivity of influenza antigen test was reported as 62.3% [5]. Additionally, in the study comparing the FilmArray RP and conventional culture, the former identified Influenza viruses in all 24 influenza culture-positive cases, with a predictive value of 100% [13]. Accordingly, the result of influenza antigen test in the six patients might be false-negative. A multiplex PCR or loop-mediated isothermal amplification was performed to compensate for the low sensitivity of the influenza antigen test. However, conventional NAAT have not been commonly used as point of care testing (POCT) because their procedures are complicated and included manual operation. FilmArray RP is a fully automated platform for NAAT and reports a result within an hour. FilmArray RP requires only 2 min hands-on time, while in-house real-time PCR requires 200 min [14]. The mean turnaround time of FilmArray was 2.1 h as compared with the in-house real-time PCR with a mean of 26.5 h (P < 0.001) [15]. In the previous comparative study on FilmArray RP and in-house real-time PCR, after conducting the FilmArray, the mean time to the test result was significantly shorter and the percentage of patients with a result in the emergency department was greater than those before implementation [16]. Therefore, with its high sensitivity, simplicity, and rapidity, FilmArray RP can be used as a POCT in patients with URTI. If FilmArray RP was used as a routine test, we could diagnose the illness of four patients, who were negative for influenza antigen test and not treated with anti-influenza agents, as influenza.",

However, these pathogens should be detected. In this study, nine patients positive in the FilmArray RP were treated with antibiotics, and only three patients were positive during the sputum culture among them. From these results, prescribing antibiotics for six patients might be inappropriate. The inappropriate use of antibiotics has become a global concern, because it led to the emergence of multidrug-resistant pathogens. Although viruses are the most common causative pathogens for ARTI, antibiotics have been commonly prescribed in many patients with URTI or acute bronchitis [2], [3], [4]. A previous study reported that the mean duration of antibiotic use was significantly shorter after implementation of FilmArray than that before the implementation [16]. Furthermore, the combination of FilmArray RP and serum procalcitonin showed the potential to improve the prescription of antibiotics [15]. In this study, FilmArray RP results were not reported to the physicians, and its use as a routine test may reduce the inappropriate use of antibiotics.",
